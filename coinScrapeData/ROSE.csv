THE TAB: A Major Source of Anti-Liam Payne Hate,liampayne1D,1i9sid5,2025-01-25 12:47:57,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/liampayne1D/comments/1i9sid5/the_tab_a_major_source_of_antiliam_payne_hate/,Consistent_Skirt_273,,"The Tab is an online publication that Wikipedia describes as follows:

""***The Tab*** is a tabloid-style youth news site, published by Tab Media Ltd. It was launched at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) and has since expanded to over 80 universities in the United Kingdom and United States.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab#cite_note-guardian-ruddick-1) The name originates from both an abbreviation for [tabloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)) and a nickname applied to Cambridge students (from ""[Cantabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabrigian)'"").[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab#cite_note-guardian-ruddick-1)

*The Tab*'s network consists of a national site and an individual sub-site for each university. Local campus-based stories are produced by students, with a student editorial team for each sub-site. Professional editors in *The Tab*'s offices in Shoreditch and Williamsburg offer guidance and editorial insight to their student teams, as well as writing for the site on a regular basis.""

While The Tab is now shedding crocodile tears over Liam Payne's death, while he was alive its writers were merciless to him and always looked for ways to tear him down.

Here's a sample of their ""articles"":

# Liam Payne is the UK’s biggest ick and these embarrassing moments prove it

# A considered ranking of all five members of One Direction

It’s not looking good for Liam Payne

Of course, all these ""writers"" and ""reporters"" reel off standard woke talking points.  

This, however, didn't prevent The Tab from publishing a fawning interview with actress Rose McGowan portraying her as a feminist heroine:

[https://archive.thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2019/05/17/the-tab-meets-rose-mcgowan-125041](https://archive.thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2019/05/17/the-tab-meets-rose-mcgowan-125041)

At the time of this interview, Rose McGowan was already on the record as saying she was furious at gay men everywhere for being ""more misogynist than straight men"" and they only ever “fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange Speedo taking Molly.”  She apologized but only half-heartedly:

[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rose-mcgowan-apologises-for-claiming-gay-men-fought-for-wearing-speedos-taking-mdma-but-stands-by-misogyny-comments-9844496.html?dkdk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rose-mcgowan-apologises-for-claiming-gay-men-fought-for-wearing-speedos-taking-mdma-but-stands-by-misogyny-comments-9844496.html?dkdk)

More on Rose's opinions:

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2823057/Rose-McGowan-apologizes-generalizing-gay-men-fighting-right-stand-float-Speedo-stands-claim-gay-men-don-t-defend-women.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2823057/Rose-McGowan-apologizes-generalizing-gay-men-fighting-right-stand-float-Speedo-stands-claim-gay-men-don-t-defend-women.html)

Of course, if Liam had ever said anything remotely like this, he would've been cancelled and harassed across the board and The Tab would've published dozens of articles dogpiling on him forever.  Liam, who has never said anything bigoted and hate-filled about anyone, was The Tab's favourite punching bag, yet Saint Rose was never called out and instead treated with kid gloves by the interviewer.  I'm sure there's plenty of other celebs that's true of all well.

The Tab is a textbook example of the total hypocrisy and double standards of cancel culture zealots in the media.  They'll just slot one person into the ""bad"" category and another into the ""good"" category and it's all just based around their own personal preferences.  If they'd wanted, they could have played down Rose McGowan's virtues and played up her vices to make her look awful and get her cancelled.  If they'd wanted, there's more than enough biographical detail to make Liam look like the most wonderful, and yes, ""progressive,"" guy in the world.  It's all in which details you choose to highlight and which you choose to conceal.

Long story short: The Tab, a major source of long-term Liam hate, is a hotbed of hypocrisy and political double standards.  Everything they write is saturated with wokeness, yet the wokeness is never consistently applied, but just assigned according to the arbitrary whims of the writers and editors with no consistency whatsoever.  This is how they got away with bashing Liam non-stop over nothing, while making excuses for other celebs they happened to like."

**Background**

Elbow has existed, in one form or another, since the early 90s, when many of the original members were in school. As the decade went on, the name evolved from Mr. Soft, to just Soft, to the not even remotely textural Elbow. After a failed attempt at recording a debut album in the late 90s, they were signed to Manchester label Ugly Man Records, and released a few EPs (Noisebox, Newborn and Any Day Now). All of these EPs included songs that would feature on their actual debut album Asleep in the Back, released on V2 Records in 2001 in the UK and 2002 in the States. The title track, which wasn’t included on the original release, earned them their first Top 20 single in the UK. Their next two albums, 2003/4’s Cast of Thousands, and 2005/6’s Leaders of the Free World, came and went with moderate success and great critical acclaim. With 2008’s The Seldom Seen Kid, things really started to get rolling. The singles, “Grounds for Divorce” and “One Day Like This” were both Top 40 hits in the UK, and the latter had enough cultural cache to nab the band a spot at the 2012 Olympics closing ceremony, which catapulted it back up the charts to reach #4. As the 2010s rolled on, the band has consistently stayed in the Top 10 in the UK Album charts with each release, even though none of the singles have managed to have the same kind of reach as “One Day…” (and in this writer-upper’s opinion, none have had the same “kick” as Seldom Seen Kid.) And then, on March 22nd, they emerged with a new album.

Write-Up by u/MightyProJet

“What a drag it is getting old” - The Rolling Stones, “Mother’s Little Helper”

I doubt that Elbow has ever been a “cool” band. They don’t have the same belligerent swagger of an Oasis, or the doomy, Gothic allure of a Joy Division, or the heartbroken jangle of the Smiths. They came around too late for Britpop and too soon for “landfill indie”. However, one thing that they most certainly are is reliable. Like clockwork, they’ve released solid albums every two to three years since 2001, each one simultaneously shambling and soaring, clattering percussion behind clever and heartfelt turns of phrase, orchestral textures behind everyday tales of everyday Mancunians, stomping around in the gutter and looking at the stars. Many of the band members still live in and around Manchester, still have drinks with the same people they’ve known since childhood. Some of those friends have moved away, some have passed on, and some have just drifted apart. Even so, the core group of 4 (5 until the departure of founding member and drummer Richard Jupp in 2016) have stuck together and played together for nearly 35 years now. A group of lads who have known each other since their teens are turning, or have turned, 50. And so we come to the central question: what role does an aging rocker play when he’s not ready or willing to settle down?

I’ve been following Elbow almost since the beginning. I bought their first album shortly after it came out in the States in 2002, and have listened to them consistently for my entire adult life. My interest has waxed and waned over the years. Yet there’s always at least one moment that reminds me why I fell in love with them on each album: e.g, the clattering, discordant finale of “Bitten by the Tailfly,” the triumphant build and release of “Station Approach,”  the delicate wonder of “Mirrorball,” the musical sunrise of “New York Morning.” However, I’d given up on the thought of them releasing something truly knock-my-socks-off again. I’d listen to something when it came out, find a few nice moments, think “that was pretty great,” and then forget I’d ever listened to it. But not Audio Vertigo. While it may not be an album that demands your attention, once it gets its hooks in, you’re stuck. Like the cover image, it pulls you deep and sucks you deeper down the vortex.

“Things I’ve Been Telling Myself for Years” starts off simply, with a three note guitar lick over a steady beat before Guy comes in with a gradually building spiral of self-deception and ego building, simultaneously acknowledging and revelling in delusion, as a distorted guitar seems to mock his every word. The next track, “Lover’s Leap,” adds on its own kind of delusion, with an allusion to the old trope of the two lovers committing suicide. The next song (excluding a quick interlude of the ladz fucking around in the studio), “Balu,” seems to be addressed to the people in his life who have slipped away, though not in the sense of death. This time around, he’s talking to the people who have been lost in the shuffle, people he acknowledges, but either can’t, or won’t reach out to. … I’m realizing that I’m trying to impose a theme on this album where there is none. After all, this is a band who never particularly dealt with building albums around a certain “message.” If any theme can be imposed, then it exists beyond the text and more within the music. As a kind of relic of the pandemic, their previous album, Flying Dream 1 , was altogether a quieter and more intimate affair, with sparse instrumentation (save for the occasional string section) and an overall more heartfelt-sounding set of lyrics. This time around, the guitars are more distorted, the strings have been replaced by blaring horns, and the rhythms charge more than they tiptoe. Even on the slower songs, the band allows themselves more room to stretch, bringing in synths as one more color on the palette rather than using them as the whole canvas. This is a band who has never stayed in one place for long, even shifting styles from song to song. This was even the case on their debut album. It was hard for me to believe that a band could jump from the clattering “Bitten by the Tailfly” to the delicate “Asleep in the Back” to the soaring “Newborn” to the gloomy “Don’t Mix Your Drinks” in such quick succession. I think that it’s this refusal to stay still that has kept them so vital to the English musical identity for the past few decades.

The one thing that’s remained consistent over the years is Garvey’s lyrical voice. His lyrics are both universal and precise; florid and humble; divine and crassly earthbound. They focus on universal concepts (friendship, falling in love, falling out of love, moments of simple wonder), but he has an ingenious knack for phrasing. If you need examples beyond the ones included below, then consider this, taken from the finale of “Very Heaven”: “17 says feed me, feed the meter / 17 is don’t you say a word (boy) / Took aside by cellar party teacher / No-one saw but everybody heard.” You can see how he nails the precisely adolescent blend of braggadocio and boyish shame: daring enough to not give a fuck, but still young enough to feel cowed and humiliated when you’re suddenly under the spotlight. Or how about these lyrics from “The Picture”: “You’re a pitiless milestone, impossible check / You’re a lure to the shore and the rocks and a wreck / You’re a slender and elegant foot on the neck / And I love you.” Show me a better example of Bad Love, and I’ll say…”nuh uh.”

The combination of an idiosyncratic lyricist with the voice of a Northern angel and a band that has a connection bordering on the psychic has led Elbow to ranking among the greatest English bands who aren’t the Beatles. And yet, they seem to have missed out on the hype train that their better known contemporaries have hopped on. Then again, maybe their lack of international hyperstardom has contributed to their longevity. Fame has a way of fracturing longtime friendships or brotherhoods to the point where the two parties can’t be in the same room without a fistfight breaking out. It can give a band the tiniest bite of the carrot and lead them to shifting and changing to something that might seem grotesque to their younger selves. I don’t want to sound like one of those jagoffs who thinks that Obscure = Good or that Famous = Bad. Besides, the band is still practically unknown in the U.S. (save for a couple of prominent TV soundtrack syncs), so they may have a cult following, but this cult deserves to be spread far and wide. Elbow has never been cool, but that’s perfectly fine because cool almost never lasts. This band will last.

Favorite Lyrics

>Here’s to walking in every room like ascending for an Oscar Kissing hands and shaking babies, Blackpool rock imposter A cannon loosed, a golden goose Leo, sayer of the unsaid soothes

* Things I’ve Been Telling Myself for Years

>And oh, do I miss you Balu with your bookmark heart And your Bible of “Sign o’ the Times” I’ll dig you back up when they kill you And hollow your skull for my wine

* Balu

>Next time I drive you to distraction Let’s pack up a flask And we’ll park in the mist by the yawning abyss And list all the stupid shit We’ve ever said to each other and laugh

* Knife Fight

Talking Points

* What does it take for a band to grow and evolve and not just fall back on a legacy?
* Who are some other artists/bands whose lyrics really feel like poems set to music?
* Seriously, is it something in the water in Manchester?

A major thanks to u/MightyProJetfor catching us yanks (me at least) on the good word of Elbow with this essay! We'll be on break tomorrow. For now, feel free to discuss the write-up in the comments below, and take a look at the schedule to familiarize yourself with the rest of the lineup.

On my commute I was thinking about what Suzerain countries would provide new and Interesting mechanics to the game and lead to scenarios we haven’t seen before. One thing led to another and now I’ve written about 12 pages of notes on a DLC set in the country of Nibiya in Rika. I like this idea as it would be very different from both Sordland and Rizia, allowing us to be in a weak, poor, and unstable nation – beset with ethnic and religious tensions while trying to decolonize itself. So please give it a read and let me know your thoughts… and if anyone from Torpor’s reading this, please hire me, thank you :D

**A quick note on names: I used a name generator to come up with many of the names, and unfortunately, I’m pretty sure the African names I’ve used are almost certainly Rowling-esque blends of various cultures that make no sense to anyone from Africa or the Middle East – so I apologize greatly for that. Just imagine the names as placeholders.**

# Synopsis

The year is 1948. You are **Colonel Kaithen Faris**, the leader of a five-man military junta that has just seized control of Nibiya—a nation scarred by religious and ethnic divisions, haunted by a history of brutal colonization and settlement by foreign powers. As northern Rika descends into chaos and civil war, global superpowers circle like vultures, eager to exploit the turmoil. Meanwhile, remnants of the old colonial elite fight to preserve their privileges, nationalist factions strive to break free from the past, and ancient tribal leaders maneuver to restore their lost influence. Can Kaithen navigate the ruthless power struggles within The Junta, defeat domestic uprisings, outsmart foreign conspiracies, and balance the demands of his own family to lead Nibiya into a new era?

# Nibiya

The Union of Nibiya is a country located in northern Rika, with a population of 28 million divided among four major ethnic groups: the **Narebi** (40%) who inhabit the interior, the **Zhanga** (30%) settled along the coastline (also found in neighboring Democratic Zanza and Zaerland), the **Doumon** (15%) in the eastern border region, and the **Valgo-Rikans** (10%), descendants of colonial settlers. Religiously, the population is split between followers of **Nurity** and **Mossamism** (an equivalent to Islam), though indigenous animist traditions remain influential. The capital and largest city is Jamir. Nibiya's economy is centered on **uranium mining**, **rubber cultivation**, **fishing**, and the **textile industry**.

The roots of modern Nibiya trace back to the medieval Kingdom of Nibiya, which existed from the 10th to the 17th century CE, before the Valgish Empire began its colonization. Many Valgs migrated to the region, establishing cotton and rubber plantations. In 1732, the Colony of South Zaerland was formally created as a sister colony to North Zaerland. After the Valgish Revolution in 1920, both colonies declared themselves as independent republics under the rule of its minority Valg population.

Following the 1930s Rikan Emergency (a series of violent anti-colonial uprisings in Rika) and the establishment of the Rika Independence Process by the Alliance of Nations, political power gradually transitioned to a new supposedly democratic government led by the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN), resulting in the creation of the Union of Nibiya. However, by 1948, mounting unrest and widespread dissatisfaction with the NMFN government prompted the military to seize power, installing a military junta.

# The Prologue

Kaithen is born in 1909 in a rural village in Nibiya, then known as South Zaerland, a colony of the Valgish Empire. He belongs to the Narebi ethnic group, the largest ethnic group in Nibiya. His family status within the village varies, depending on the player's choice: he can be the grandson of the village leader, the son of a local animist religious figure, or a simple peasant farmer. As a child, he witnesses how his village spends part of the year working on rubber plantations controlled by the Valgish Colonial Authorities. He attends a school run by the Valgish Nurist Mission in Rika, where he faces a pivotal decision: to adopt Nurism, cling to his village’s traditional animist beliefs (and face punishment), or embrace atheism.

In 1920, the Valgish Revolution erupts. Valgish settlers in Nibiya declare independence, establishing the Republic of South Zaerland, though power remains firmly in the settlers' hands. As the state grows increasingly authoritarian, tensions rise between the indigenous population and the Valgish rulers. Local disputes also flare, including a conflict over fishing rights between Kaithan's village and the neighboring Zangha village, the second-largest ethnic group. Depending on player choices, Kaithan may find himself involved in clashes with Zangha youths. When his village leader (possibly his grandfather) is killed, a new leader is elected.

By 1926, Kaithan joins the colonial military, where his leadership potential is recognized. He advances as far as a Rikan can within the racially stratified military. During this period, a pro-independence group called the National Movement for Free Nibiya (NMFN) gains popularity, advocating for self-rule.

In 1934, the Rikan Emergency begins with a CSP-backed rebellion in the neighboring Lespian colony of Cabo Zanza. Lespian's failed intervention triggers widespread unrest across the continent. Atrocities committed by both settlers and indigenous forces escalate tensions across Rika's colonies, including South Zaerland. Uprisings break out, and Kaithan must choose whether to follow orders and suppress a local riot.

In response to mounting pressure, the Valgish-dominated government agrees to gradual decolonization. In 1937, power is transferred to the NMFN, which renames the country Nibiya. Under the new government, Kaithan rises to the rank of colonel, commanding a special infantry brigade: the Nibiyan Light Infantry. His growing influence enables his younger brother, Saif, to assume leadership of their village.

During the 1940s, dissatisfaction with the NMFN government intensifies. Economic stagnation, entrenched wealth inequality favoring the Valgish elite, and the political dominance of the Zangha people fuel public resentment. A communist revolutionary movement gains traction, raising fears of a civil war akin to the bloody conflicts engulfing neighboring Zanza and Dorghuk.

Amid this unrest, Kaithan and four fellow military colonels, each driven by their own ambitions and concerns, decide to act. After months of secret planning, they execute a successful coup d'état, toppling the NMFN government. They establish a military junta known as the Committee for National Salvation (CNS), seizing control of Nibiya’s future.

# Mechanics

**Currencies**

You have three main currencies you can spend in the DLC – Political Capital, Budget, Personal Wealth. Of these **Political Capital** is the most important and represents your personal ability to persuade people. It is basically your reputation; leaning too hard on it, trying to “pull rank,” or taking actions viewed as morally reprehensible can obviously damage it, but helping people out or doing things that are popular (or rather look popular, even if they aren’t necessarily beneficial long-term) can raise it. Managing your Political Capital is essential if you are going down the Charismatic route.

**Budget** represents the treasury of Nibiya. It can be spent or raised at various points of the game. Compared to Sordland and Rizia, Nibiya is a poor country. It also has less capacity to go into debt compared to Sordland as lenders are less willing to let Nibiya borrow money.

**Personal Wealth** represents your own personal funds, which again can be acquired or spent at various points in the game. Due to the high levels of corruption within Nibiya, sometimes personal wealth can serve as a substitute for Political Capital – it is therefore of even more importance than in the base game.

**Legitimacy & Unrest**

Legitimacy is a key stat in the game and represents both domestic and international support for the military government. If this gets too low, civil war is more likely to break out. Maintaining a high degree of legitimacy is a must for the new government.

Unrest specifically represents regional dissatisfaction with the government. High unrest can lead to regional uprisings if combined with low legitimacy. Deployment of military forces can quell unrest although it might have consequences down the line.

**Military Deployment and Equipment**

The main new mechanic introduced in the DLC is the ability to deploy soldiers to different regions of the country, similar to the war mechanic in Rizia. Deploying soldiers helps quell unrest but also fight enemies in that region, be they foreign mercenaries, mutinying soldiers, or local rebellions.

Different units have different specializations and quality, and you can also control how they are equipped, drawing from a finite pool of equipment. Deploying soldiers costs political capital, the central currency of this DLC. Deploying your own soldiers costs the least political capital (but could leave you personally vulnerable), while trying to deploy units under the command of the other members of The Junta costs more, depending on their relationship to you.

Should violence break out between the members of The Junta, the position, equipment, and quality of the units will prove decisive in choosing a victor.

Kaithen can grow his own powerbase of soldiers, particularly by drawing on manpower from his home region, provided his relationship with them remains positive.

# Factions and Characters

The following are the primary factions that must be appeased or dealt with for The Junta to survive.

**The Old Colony**

This is the population of Valgish settlers responsible for colonizing Nibiya during the days of the Valgish Empire. Eager to avoid the bloodshed that claimed neighboring Zanza, they agreed to a process of gradually ceding political power to the indigenous population; they were able to find amenable partners in the National Movement for Free Nibiya. They are among the richest citizens in Nibiya and control much of the land and in particular the key Rubber and Textile industries, much to the chagrin of many indigenous Nibiyans. Far from being sympathetic to the socialist revolution of their homeland, the Valgish have a vested interest in getting Arcasia and other ATO states invested in Nibiya, hoping to make the superpower a guarantor of their protection within the country, despite their apparent opposition to the liberal ideals of the Arcasian republic. They are increasingly interested in the possibility of deploying Arcasian private military contractors to protect their property within Nibiya.

The Old Colony is represented by the character of **Hans-Günther Von Caprivi**, the largest landowner in Nibiya and son of the last Valgish Governor of South Zaerland.

**The Liberators**

The Liberators is the name for the coalition of activists, intellectuals, journalists, and politicians who believe the decolonization of Nibiya is not yet complete. Many were members of the National Movement for Free Nibiya but later left after becoming disillusioned with the slowness of the decolonization process and by the retained influence of the Old Colony. They wish to see a Nibiya that is self-sufficient, controlled by its indigenous population, and capable of resisting foreign influence. They also wish to diversify and modernize the Nibiya economy to be less reliant on primary extractive industries. Many have socialist ideals but while there are some ties with United Cortana and the CSP, many do not trust the superpower to be a totally benevolent patron of their new nation. Increasingly radicalized, many are increasingly believing that violence might be the only way to remove the influence of the Old Colony and seize the destiny of their country.

The Liberators are represented by **Walyd Beringer**, party leader for the Liberation Vanguard, a radical communist party within the Nibiyan Congress.

**The Tribal Elite**

The Tribal Elite refers to a caste of chiefs, elders, religious figures, and family patrons who wield an incredible amount of ceremonial and informal power within Nibiyan society. Although Nibiya has a long history of its own rulers and legal systems, the so-called Tribal Elite system emerged alongside Valgish colonization, as the colonial power created tribal elites with which to rule through the indigenous population. Regardless, many Nibiyans do view the Tribal Elite as holding a great deal of authority and legitimacy and therefore their influence cannot be disregarded.

The Tribal Elite view the Liberators’ vision of the modernized Nibiyan state with suspicion, seeing it as a threat to their traditional power and also a path to societal and moral decay. They wish to see a return to old ways of Nibiyan society, an agricultural society built around trust in one’s community, elders, and neighbors. The Tribal Elite is represented by **Zaher Nima Naaji**, the Zhanga Prince of Sunsa. However, two other characters: **Saif Faris** (Kaithen’s brother) and **General Salah** (Kaithen’s colleague in The Junta) also play a role in representing the opinions of the Narebi and Doumon respectively.

**Additionally, there are two other factions that have specific importance to the position of Kaithen Faris.**

**The Nibiyan Light Infantry**

A brigade-sized special infantry unit of the Nibiyan Army under the command of Colonel Kaithen Faris. They form the core of Faris’ powerbase within the country. Although loyal to Kaithen, he can lose their support, which would be a catastrophic scenario. They are represented in-game by the character of **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**, Kaithen’s second-in-command and close friend.

**The Serenica Narebi**

This is Kaithen’s ‘Tribe.’ Serenica is the home region of Kaithen Faris, and the Narebi community in Serenica forms a core part of Kaithen’s support beyond the military and the government and is therefore very useful to Kaithen. They are very loyal to Kaithen and his brother, Saif, although they have their own political needs and wants. They are represented by the character of **Saif Faris**, Kaithen’s brother.

# The Junta

The Committee for National Salvation, more commonly referred to as **The Junta**, is the ruling body directing Nibiya while it remains under military rule. They are roughly equivalent to the Presidential Cabinet in Sordland and the Royal Council in Rizia, although power is distributed far more evenly. While **Colonel Kaithan Faris** officially holds the position of President, his ability to act depends on the consent of at least 50% of the council (preferably 100%). At various points in the game, members of The Junta can either be convinced to step down or removed by force. The five members of The Junta are:

**Colonel Kaithen Faris – President**

The player character. Kaithen’s role in organizing the coup and recruiting the others has led to his appointment as President. Despite holding the title, it is understood that the committee strives to make unanimous decisions whenever possible.

**General Zainan Salah – Secretary for the Interior**

**General Salah** is the only woman in The Junta and the sole member of the Doumon Mossamist ethnic-religious community. The Mossamist faith has a tradition of allowing women to serve in leadership roles, but this doesn’t mean women in the Nibiyan military are free from resentment by combat troops. She comes from the eastern border region and previously commanded the Military Police Units of the Nibiyan army, which made her a natural choice for overseeing the Ministry for the Interior.

General Salah is the most ideological member of the Committee, firmly believing in the possibility of a multi-ethnic, functional Nibiyan democracy. The failure of the previous NMFN government to achieve this motivated her to join the coup. She is also highly concerned with the security of the neighboring unstable nation of **West Doughuk** and is committed to protecting the Doumon people living there. While not an open communist, she views **United Cortana** more favorably than others.  
During the Rikan Emergency, she executed an order to kill dozens of arrested military personnel suspected of disloyalty, a secret she is desperate to keep hidden.

**Lieutenant-Colonel Mansour Faiz Vogel – Secretary for the Exterior**

**Colonel Vogel** is arrogant, egotistical, and often displays narcissistic tendencies. However, he is also highly charismatic and dangerously charming. Kaithen likely recruited Vogel into the coup out of necessity, relying on his tank battalion to secure the capital, Jamir. Vogel demanded the position of Secretary for the Exterior or Interior in exchange for his support.

Born in Jamir to a Narebi family with Valgish ancestry, Vogel leveraged his heritage to rise higher in the colonial military than most Nibiyans. He dreams of establishing a strong, militaristic state (with himself in charge) that asserts itself as a regional power. Vogel has no ideological loyalty to either the **CSP** or **ATO**, except where their support advances his aims. He is openly angling to take over The Junta and establish himself as a strongman dictator.

Vogel is maintaining affairs with the wives of **Ikraam Abdel** and **Tajiri Mwanga**, creating significant tension. He and General Salah openly despise one another. Vogel is an antagonistic force in the story and one of the most challenging members to remove.

**General Ikraam Abdel – Secretary for Finance**

**General Ikraam Abdel** is both the oldest member of the committee and by-far the most well-respected, having a long and well-regarded history of service that begins in the Valgish colonial troops, then the South Zaer Republic Army and later the Nibiyan army. He is respected by all communities, even the Valgish community, after, during the Rikan Emergency, he defused a situation that would have otherwise turned into a bloodbath between indigenous workers and Valgish settlers. He was previously made head of the Armed Forces by the NMFN government but was later removed from this position. He joined the coup after learning about planned budget cuts to the military and Kaithen can suggest in dialogue that he wanted Abdel to be president instead of him but only took on the role due to Vogel’s objections. Due to the belief that Abdel was extremely trustworthy and non-corruptible, he was put in charge of the country’s treasury following the coup. Abdel is a devoutly Nurist Narebi from the north of Nibiya. He previously led the 1^(st) Nibiyan Army, which was responsible for security in the country’s interior.

Abdel broadly agrees with General Salah’s vision for a democratic Nibiya although he disagrees on how soon the population will be “ready for democracy”. Having spent his early careers having to argue for the needs of Nibiyan troops to his Valgish superiors, he also cares strongly about the wellbeing of the military and will often put the needs of the military before the needs of the country at large.

Despite his respect and military expertise, it becomes apparent over the course of the game that Abdel is actual extremely incompetent at statecraft and struggles to manage the national treasury.

**Colonel Tajiri Mwanga – Secretary for Development**

**Colonel Mwanga** is a Zhanga from Yolal and a former classmate of Kaithen during their officer training in the South Zaer military. Depending on the player’s choices in the prologue, Mwanga and Kaithen may be close friends. Mwanga commands the Nibiyan Airborne Brigade and joined the coup after feeling overlooked for promotions under the NMFM government.

Mwanga lacks strong ideological convictions, often siding with Vogel. Secretly, he is highly corrupt and uses his position to enrich himself and his family.

# Paths and Endings

As in Sordland and Rizia, there are three main storylines the player can pursue, each representing a different theory of authority: **Rational-Legal Authority**, **Traditional Authority**, and **Charismatic Authority**, along with several possible failed endings. At the end of Act 2, Kaithen attempts to transform Nibiya’s government. Success depends on his actions and legitimacy, with failure often leading to civil war. The game ends shortly before 1953.

**The Rational-Legal Route**

This route see’s Kaithen work to establish a modern nation-state that will last beyond the rule of the military junta. Although nominally a parliamentary democracy, Kaithen can choose just how democratic he wants Nibiya to be. Kaithen must identify and work with various actors to establish modern courts and a functioning bureaucracy as well as set-up trusted political parties that will respect democratic outcomes. He must also work to convince or coerce the other members of the military Junta into stepping down, in favour of the new government. Kaithen can choose whether to align with either the ATO, CSP or remain neutral.

At the end of the 2^(nd) Act, a parliamentary election will be held (Kaithen will still President at this time however). If Kaithen has been successful, the results of the parliamentary election will be accepted by the country and Kaithen can then continue to work with the victors to pass further reforms in the final act. At the very end of the game, he can choose to run as an elected president or step down. However If Kaithen fails to build trust and legitimacy into his new system, the resulting of the parliamentary elections will not be respected and the factions and characters that feel they are losing out will rebel against the new government, triggering a civil war. Even if Kaithen wins the civil war, he must remain as an unelected president overseeing the new government.

**The Traditionalist Route**

This storyline see’s Kaithen essentially synthesize a new political ideology which puts Nibiyan traditions front and centre. In this story Kaithen seeks to empower the Tribal Elite as much as possible while trying to return to the country’s agrarian past as a way of reversing the trauma of colonialism. He can choose whether to make the country a “equable and plurinational” where each indigenous ethnic group has similar powers or he can try and make it dominated by the Narebi (his ethnic group) and their traditions. A successful Traditionalist run would see him work to peacefully overcome the various feuds and disputes between various tribal and religious communities. If he’s unsuccessful, the various ethnic/religious groups will go to war with one another and if Kaithen wins the civil war, its suggested the scars of ethnic division will never heal. This run can end with the country under the control of a “High Council of Elders” or with Kaithen appointing himself as the new King of Nibiya.

This route brings Kaithen into conflict with both the other members of The Junta and the Old Colony, although the Liberators can eventually be brought round. This run prevents Kaithen from being able to align with either of the superpowers (although he can choose market his new ideology as “Rikan Socialism”) but there is a suggestion in the epilogue that he can choose closer relations with the emerging Intermerkopan, depending on choices made in the Rizia DLC.

**The Charismatic Route**

This run see’s Kaithan aim to remove the other members of The Junta, overcome the various factions, and become a strongman dictator. There are many options as to how and to what extent Kaithan achieves this. Towards the end of the second act, Kaithan will attempt some kind of second coup or purge of The Junta and other factions. If he’s successful, he will bring the country under his sole authority but if unsuccessful the surviving factions and junta members will rise up against him, triggering a civil war. During this run he can align himself with either superpower or remain neutral.

# Foreign Relations

The three non-superpower foreign nations that will play a prominent role in the story are Democratic Zanza, West Dorghuk, and Zaerland.

**Democratic Zanza**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Narebi (Minority)  
**Religion:** Rikan Nurity, Animism, Presidential Cult of Personality  
**Industries:** Cocoa, Subsistence Farming, Gas  
**Alignment:** CSP  
**Military Power:** Equal to Nibiya  
**Economy:** Poorer than Nibiya

Democratic Zanza was previously a Lespian colony called Cabo Zanza. However, the indigenous population rose, leading to a bloody rebellion roughly analogous to the Portuguese colonial wars – this started the Rikan Emergency. The rebels were backed by the CSP and embraced a communist ideology. After securing their independence, the country gradually became a dictatorship with a cult of personality around its dictator, **Musa Nyundo**. Nyundo is charismatic but unstable and implied to be growing increasingly mentally ill. There are a number of rebellions against his rule, and over the course of the game, it becomes apparent he is conducting a Pol Pot-style purge of anyone he deems to be a threat.

Democratic Zanza’s foreign policy is erratic and unpredictable. The country’s main concern is the ATO-aligned Marabone to its east. Nyundo will start off as friendly towards Nibya but will quickly feel threatened if Kaithen is too successful pushing for reforms or consolidating his own power. Should relations turn unfriendly, Nyundo may start to threaten the Narebi ethnic minority in Democratic Zanza or start claiming that the Zhanga minority in Nibya need liberating. Initially aligned with the CSP, Maina might suddenly switch to being neutral if Nibiya starts to align with the CSP. In general, Maina wants Nibiya to act as a bulwark against the ATO.

Towards the middle of the game, Nyundo (if he remains on good terms with Kaithen) may request military support against the growing insurgency in Democratic Zanza. Doing this makes Nibiya complicit in Maina’s war crimes but provides options later in the game to support regime change in Democratic Zanza, turning the country into a puppet of Nibiya. Otherwise, Democratic Zanza’s fate is dependent on how Nibiya is aligned at the end of the game. If Nibiya is aligned with the ATO, the CSP step up their support for Nyundo’s regime, allowing him to cling to power. If Nibiya is aligned with the CSP, the CSP indicate they would support a Nibiyan invasion into Democratic Zanza. If Nibiya is neutral, mercenaries from Marabone invade and, in the epilogue, Nibiya has the option to intervene against them, turning the war into a proxy war.

**Zaerland**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Zhangha (majority), Valgish-Rikans (ruling minority)  
**Religion:** Nurity  
**Exports:** Ivory, gold, coffee, tobacco  
**Alignment:** ATO  
**Military Power:** Greater than Nibiya  
**Economy:** Richer than Nibiya

Zaerland is very much the Apartheid South Africa of Rika. Established in the early 18th century, the territory of Valgish Rika was split between the colonies of North Zaerland and South Zaerland in 1732. The Northern Colony received a much greater portion of Valgish settlers than the South, and thus was favored for investment and development by the Valgish empire. Both colonies declared independence following the Valgish revolution; however, their paths diverged during the Rikan Emergency when the North Zaer Armed Forces (which were predominantly Valgish, compared to the SZAF) effectively suppressed the uprising. After South Zaerland became Nibiya, North Zaerland became referred to as just Zaerland. Zaerland subsequently agreed in principle to the Rika Independence Process, although has made considerably slow progress on actually transitioning the country to majority rule.

Officially the country is a parliamentary democracy; however, in practice, its complex tricameral legislature serves to retain the power of the Valgish-Rikan elite. A common refrain from Zaer politicians is that “Reform is Coming,” yet Valgish-Rikans remain politically and economically dominant over the indigenous Rikans. The Zaer police are known for their brutality. Presently Zaerland is led by **Rudolph Von Heertz** of the Zaer National Party. The country is the richest in Rika, although there is a huge wealth divide, and also has the most powerful military on the continent.

Zaerland desires closer relations with the ATO, who see them as a potential partner in such a CSP-dominated region; however, Arcasia is concerned over the public backlash from being too closely aligned with the internationally unpopular state. Zaerland’s chief foreign policy concern is the welfare of the Valgish-Rikans in Nibiya. If they feel the Valgish-Rikans are being mistreated, they will step up military support for a mercenary intervention in Nibiya. Most other Rikan nations (along with Valgsland and Galmland) are hostile to Zaerland, so the Zaer government is willing to work with Nibiya on trade and security. Being too close with Zaerland may result in a backlash from a large segment of the Nibiyan population, however.

Depending on Kaithen’s actions in the game, he may be able to put enough pressure on the Von Heertz government to finally take reform seriously, especially if Nibiya becomes aligned with the ATO. (If Nibiya becomes aligned with the CSP, it’s hinted in the epilogue that Zaerland is pursuing its own nuclear weapons program.) Nibiya can also attempt to arm rebels in Zaerland, although this will only result in Zaerland becoming more hostile and authoritarian. If relations with Zaerland are good and Nibiya enters a civil war, Zaerland will offer military support (although this will trigger a backlash from the Liberators faction). If relations with Zaerland are poor, however, they will send armed units into Nibiya to secure their border.

**West Dorghuk**  
**Ethnic Groups:** Doumon, numerous other ethnic groups  
**Religion:** Mossamism, others  
**Exports:** Oil, uranium, gas, rare minerals  
**Alignment:** none  
**Military Power:** Numerous rebel groups  
**Economy:** very low

West Dorghuk is a collapsed failed state on the border of Nibiya. Formerly part of the Arcasian client state of the Kingdom of the Dorghuk, following the king’s overthrow during the Rikan Emergency, the country split into East and West Dorghuk. West Dorghuk fell into civil war immediately between various factions and ethnic groups. Predominantly desert, the country is rich in resources, especially energy resources, and the recent discovery of uranium has attracted the attention of the superpowers. Nearly every neighboring nation is also interfering in some way in the civil war in West Dorghuk while refugees flee the country. The conflict is beginning to take on sectarian dimensions due to a growing rebel force of Fundamentalist Mossamists who are allegedly targeting Nurists in the country.

Kaithen can push for Nibiya to involve itself in the West Dorghuk Civil War, both sending financial aid and military units into the country. The latter presents opportunities to seize resources within the nation, although will likely result in international outcry. To successfully intervene, alliances will need to be forged with the various factions of the civil war and with other nations intervening. Nibiya can also send or facilitate humanitarian aid flowing into the country. Another major problem will be dealing with the mass of refugees coming out of the country.

**United Cortana**  
With many allies in the region (Galmsland, Democratic Zanza), the lingering cultural influence of Valgsland, and the general appeal of socialism in the region, United Cortana is the more influential superpower on the Rikan continent. Despite this, their presence isn’t entirely welcome by all, as many see them as little more than would-be colonizers trying to “civilize” Rika through socialism rather than imperialism. The UC are represented in the game by their boorish ambassador, **Yolotzin Eluney Ubirajara**, who frequently implies Nibiya and the rest of Rika owe the Cortanas a debt due to “inspiring” their revolutions and assumes the country is already in the CSP’s sphere of influence. Early in the game, he will offer a deal demanding Nibiyan uranium and rubber in exchange for money and an offer to send Cortana doctors and administrators to teach skills to the Nibiyans. Should relations with the Nibiyan Junta fail, the UC would rather see a socialist government under the ‘Liberators’ Faction. They can potentially send funds and arms to help start a socialist rebellion against the Junta government.

**Arcasia**  
Arcasia, a former colonizer of Rika, is slowly starting to gain a foothold in the region, although it treads cautiously, despite the desires from colonial settler populations to “liberate them from the indigenous Nurless Communists.” While openly pretending to remain distant on most Rikan affairs, the Arcasian Centre for Intelligence (ACI) has established a prominent network of agents and informers throughout the continent, hoping to sow chaos in United Cortana’s backyard. Arcasia’s only real ally at this point is Marabone, which is effectively a colony in all but name. If there is a Civil War in Nibiya, mercenaries from Marabone may aid or attack Kaithen’s forces, depending on his relationship with the superpower. If Kaithen becomes too close to the CSP, it’s suggested that Arcasia are plotting to allow the Old Colony to retake power in Nibiya.

In the game, Arcasia is represented by **Aurélia Bouvier**, a journalist of Geopolitico stationed in Jamir and secretly an ACI agent. Under the guise of an interview, she will approach Kaithen and offer to act as a backchannel between him and the Arcasians. During the game, Arcasia will offer to help develop Nibiya’s industries (especially its uranium industry) in exchange for partial ownership. They may sweeten the deal with personal bribes to Kaithen and offer useful intelligence to him.

**Other Nations**  
**Imaland** is a strongman dictatorship with theocratic elements, as the country is ruled under Mossamist law. They are heavily involved in backing Mossamist insurgents in West Dorghuk. Zaerland may want to cooperate with Nibiya in fighting their insurgent forces there.

**East Dorghuk** is the communist nation that emerged from the collapse of the Kingdom of Dorghuk. It claims rightful ownership of West Dorghuk, but its attempts to occupy the country have faced opposition from the West Dorghuk radical Mossamists.

**Zhao** is an unusual nation, being the only Zaranist nation of Rika, whose people descend from Qinal. A small Zhao minority resides in West Dorghuk, who desire to secede and join Zhao. Zhao, inevitably, is backing this militant group. Zhao is an authoritarian republic with a planned economy.

**Marabone** is essentially a neo-colony of Arcasia. Although in principle a parliamentary republic, it is in reality controlled by a small number of Arcasian businesses. Arcasian PMCs operate in Marabone and frequently cross the border into West Dorghuk.

# Economy

Nibiya’s current economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture with strong contributions from rubber, fishing, and the textiles industry. Large uranium deposits have been found in the east near the border with West Dorghuk.

The majority of Nibiyans work in subsistence agriculture. This generates little income for the country; however, attempting to shift too much of the population away from subsistence agriculture may lead to famine. Rural agricultural villages also form the bedrock of Nibiya, and especially Narebi, society and culture, and upsetting this dynamic may have severe consequences.

The Gulf of Rika is home to vast schools of fish, which are primarily farmed by small artisan fishing crews. Recently, they have been forced to compete against large fishing companies from Lespia and Arcasia. Closer relations with a superpower could help reduce the pressure on Nibiyan fishermen. Continued competition may result in Nibiyan fishermen resorting to… other means… to make money.

Despite rubber being the country’s “cash crop,” it remains a point of shame due to the harsh exploitative conditions workers in the industry face, which were established during colonial rule. The rubber industry is still largely owned by a few Valgish-Rikan companies. While many Nibiyans want reform of both working conditions and management, the loss of the expertise of the companies could severely harm the industry’s profitability.

The growing number of textile factories around Nibiya’s major cities presents an interesting opportunity for the nation as more developed countries seek to outsource production to countries with cheap labour. But can Nibiya balance the need for development with preventing the further exploitation of its labourers?

Huge deposits of uranium have been found near the border with West Dorghuk. This untapped resource could both provide Nibiya with a newfound source of income and be the key to its energy independence. But choosing to exploit such a sought-after commodity will inevitably attract the attention of the world’s superpowers…

# Social/Cultural Issues

Nibiya faces three main societal challenges that Kaithen must face: rural forms of justice vs. establishing a proper policing and judicial system, balancing development and political power among Nibiya’s various ethnic and religious groups, and reconciliation with the atrocities of colonialism.

# Personal Life

Unlike Anton Rayne and Romus Toras, Kaithen Faris does not have a wife or children of his own (it could even be hinted that Kaithen is asexual). He faces familial pressure from his siblings and extended family, chiefly represented by his older brother, **Saif Faris**, who is effectively the “chief” of their “tribe,” the Serenica Narebi. Saif wants to use his brother’s power to advance the position of their people, while often failing to appreciate the more nuanced view his brother has to consider.

Kaithen Faris also has to consider the needs of his own personal brigade of soldiers, the Nibiyan Light Infantry, who are represented by Kaithen’s second-in-command, **Lieutenant Jabel Musafa**. Although loyal to him, they too may not fully appreciate the complexities of politics and prefer more straightforward solutions to the country’s problems.

**Jovi Rosee, Head of Production of Rosee Studios, Employee of MultiVer Solutions, Head Writer and Executive Director of “The Exterminators (2141)”**

*Six days, four hours until incident*

The train from Hartsfield-Jackson was always my favorite part about coming home in my college days. The ride, taking us into Five Points, the heart of the city, seemed like it was positioned to see as little of the city as possible, but that didn't fool me. Atlanta—The ATL, Silicon Peach, The City in a Forest, whatever you called it—I was here, and I felt... home.

Although home was a half hour drive away, Atlanta still felt like it was where I belonged. When I was a kid, going into Atlanta wasn't that big of a deal: a day trip, sure, but almost never a full-on vacation. Ever since I went to college in what was then Spain, however, Atlanta was far enough away to basically be on another planet.

…which made being evacuated to Skalga, a literal other planet, feel even more isolating.

Danny, who was sitting next to me, gave me a little nudge that pulled me from my thoughts. “Did you hear about MultiVer’s latest ‘big idea’?”

Max finally glanced up from her holopad, curious. “What now?”

Danny leaned forward, lowering his voice a little, though there was no real reason to whisper. “MultiVer Interstellar Solutions—you know, the new space transit arm they’re building out? They’re starting to sell tickets for civilian voyages to Skalga and Leirn.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Already? I thought they were still testing prototypes for that.”

“Nah, it’s happening,” Danny replied, grinning like he was in on a secret. “Ideally, they want to make space travel as common as hopping on a plane or train. Skalga’s the big ticket item, obviously— thanks to the Exchange program and the refugee population on Skalga, a lot of people *love* the idea of visiting the Venlil homeworld, even with the mask restrictions. And Leirn? I think they’re trying to position as the ultimate ‘cultural getaway.’ You know, surfing with aliens, 'historic' cities, rustic charm. Really leaning into the exotic vibe.”

Max snorted again, shaking her head. “They’re trying to turn interplanetary travel into a vacation package. Classic MultiVer.”

“Hey, if it works, it works,” Danny shot back. “And they’re pricing the tickets surprisingly low—well, for space travel. The first runs are already getting waitlisted.”

The thought of it was… surreal. I glanced out the window as the train hummed along, passing through pockets of greenery and glimpses of the Atlanta skyline. I’d grown up dreaming of seeing the world. Now people were dreaming of *Skalga* and *Leirn*.

“My brother told me the neighborhood he and the family were placed in was called ‘Little Terminus’ now,” I said, thinking of my family a thirty minute drive to the south of us. It sounded, and if the photos are accurate, looked like a strange sort of nostalgia—Atlantans of all different stripes creating a city that could only exist on Skalga. “Murals of the skyline and fried pies baked in strayu ovens…” I trailed off, smiling at the thought. “If we go to Skalga someday, I’d definitely visit the place.”

“Little Terminus?” Max repeated with a smirk. “That’s kind of cute.”

“Sure sounds like it,” I agreed, then turned to Max with a mischievous grin. “Hey, what kind of strings do you think we’d have to pull to arrange a convention tour on Skalga?”

Max rolled her eyes, pretending to be exasperated. “Depends. Are we going for tourism or publicity?”

“Both,” I replied quickly, leaning back in my seat. “There’s a market for human media just about anywhere in the Sapient Coalition, and there’s a significant human presence on Skalga. Doesn’t seem fair that we’re only focusing on Earth when we’ve got an audience across several planets.”

Danny nodded thoughtfully, tapping his fingers on his knee. “You’re not wrong. The numbers from Skalga alone are solid. I bet we could get a turnout for a fan event. We’d just have to work with the UN on visas. And MultiVer would probably jump at the chance to cross-promote their new interstellar lines.”

Max groaned. “We’re not turning *The Exterminators* into an interstellar tourism ad, Danny.”

“Why not?” Danny said, throwing up his hands with a laugh. “Think of the posters! ‘The galaxy at your fingertips, with MultiVer Interstellar Solutions!’”

I couldn’t help but laugh at the image. It was a little ridiculous, sure, but in a weird way, it wasn’t *impossible*. The train began to slow as we approached the station, the skyline growing larger in the window. It was a reminder of just how far everything had come—Atlanta, Earth, humanity as a whole. We weren’t confined to just this city or even this planet anymore.

Max sighed dramatically. “If you two start pitching this to MultiVer, I’m not coming. I’ll send a hologram or something.”

“No holograms,” I shot back, grinning. “If we’re going to Skalga, we’re bringing the whole team.”

The train slid to a smooth stop, the automated announcer welcoming us to Five Points Station. As we gathered our things, Danny muttered, half-jokingly, “Well, if we get a convention on Skalga, I’m putting in a request for Leirn next. I hear Yotul cuisine is fabulously spicy.”

Max snorted one last time as we stepped onto the platform. “Always thinking ahead, aren’t you, Danny?”

Danny grinned. “Somebody’s gotta.”

 

We filed off the train and into the station, the air thick with the familiar smells of fast food and transit grime. I took a deep breath, letting the city seep into my senses. This was Atlanta—a messy, buzzing, unapologetically alive place. And for the next few hours, it was the center of my universe.

The MultiVer Peachtree Plaza was a massive building, one of the tallest in Atlanta, and for years, the tallest building in any U.S. state capital. While MultiVer hadn’t been the ones to originally build it—its towering glass-and-steel structure had been an iconic part of Atlanta’s skyline since the late 20th century—they had certainly found a home in it. MultiVer had taken what was once a sleek but aging skyscraper and turned it into the beating heart of their global operations. The company had spared no expense modernizing the space: its facade shimmered with sleek holographic displays with ever-shifting art showcasing MultiVer’s reach across not just the world, but now *worlds*.

Stepping through the rotating glass doors into the lobby felt like entering another reality altogether. The space was *alive*—a hive of movement and sound that felt at once chaotic and meticulously curated. A polished marble floor stretched out before us, reflecting the glow of towering LED screens and virtual displays that floated in the air. Panels of light pulsed with soft, ambient colors—peach tones and warm golds—that gave the space an inviting but distinctly futuristic feel.

Max looked around as we took it in, and I heard her mutter under her breath, “Plentygreen City feels kind of small now.”

She wasn’t wrong. It was easy to forget that MultiVer wasn’t just a media company. Sure, they made movies, television shows, video games, and all other manner of media. But they were also a giant in other places. Their fingers were in everything— pharmaceuticals, clothing, electronics, foodstuffs, advanced communications tech that had helped unify fractured planetary networks, and even some military equipment that had seen action with the UN.

Standing here in the MultiVer Plaza, it was clear that they wanted to *show* that reach. They wanted you to know that they weren’t just a business.

They were *the* business.

Danny, who had been here on the regular before back when he worked in MultiVer’s legal department, looked bored as he scrolled through his holopad, though he muttered a quick “Welcome to Ground Zero of all things MultiVer,” as we walked further into the lobby.

But Flurin and Max—this being their first time at MultiVer’s global headquarters—were visibly taken aback. Their surprise wasn’t just from the grandeur of the place, though I could see Flurin’s eyebrows climbing toward his— Hairline? Quill-line? —as he scanned the massive crystal chandelier that hung like a web of light above us.

“Are there always *this* many non-humans here?” Flurin asked, his tone somewhere between curious and impressed.

I followed his gaze, and I had to admit, it was striking. While humans were still the majority in the lobby, there was a notable mix of aliens walking through the space. The familiar species were easy to pick out: Venlil with their soft, woolly fur, some with horn headbands and some without, Gojid with their spiked backs, and Yotul, walking with the confidence they had ferociously earned. But there were others I didn’t expect to see working for humans: Krakotl, notably, but also Tilfish, Mazic, and I’m pretty sure there was a tour being given to a group of Dossur.

It wasn’t just the variety—it was the energy. Species of all kinds were chatting, exchanging papers and datapads, laughing together, and moving with purpose. It felt… seamless. Natural. Like this building wasn’t just a corporate headquarters but a hub for something much bigger.

“Guess they’ve put the *multi* in MultiVer, huh?” Danny said, breaking the silence. His tone was light, but his eyes were scanning the crowd like he was cataloging every detail.

Max gave a low whistle. “I mean, I knew they were big on integration, but this is next-level. Do you think they’ve got a Xeno Resources department, or is it just one big melting pot?”

Flurin’s brow furrowed, his voice low and thoughtful. “There’s got to be specialized departments. Some of these species have completely different environmental needs—temperature, air composition… Even some dietary accommodations would be a nightmare to manage universally.”

I nodded, still watching the scene. “Whatever they’re doing, it’s working. And it’s a hell of a statement.”

Max smirked, gesturing toward a nearby group of Venlil employees chatting animatedly with a pair of humans. “Bet this is a marketing team. Probably brainstorming how to pitch to Skalga next quarter.”

Flurin elbowed her. “Not everything is about marketing, Max.”

“Tell that to the giant MultiVer logo on the front of this building,” she shot back, grinning.

 

Before the back-and-forth could continue, a voice cut through the bustling noise of the lobby. “Ah, there’s my team!”

I turned to see Jesse Multin approaching, his blue sharp suit impeccably tailored, his orange tie masterfully tied, and his wide grin as disarming as ever. His fast, confident strides carried him across the room like he owned the place—and he more or less did. He was the CEO and Co-President of MultiVer, after all (Mr. Oliver, who based himself in the Multaverde office, being the other).

“Welcome to MultiVer Plaza!” Jesse said, arms outstretched as if presenting the entire building to us. “Hope the train ride was smooth. And hey, glad you all got a chance to see the *real* MultiVer on your way in. First impressions matter, and this lobby? It’s a showstopper, isn’t it?”

“Definitely makes a statement,” I replied, shaking his hand.

“Good, good,” Jesse remarked, beaming. His gaze flicked to Flurin and Max, as he shook each of their hands. “First time here, huh? What do you think? Honest impressions only—don’t hold back.”

Max raised an eyebrow. “It’s… impressive. Feels like a miniature Sapient Coalition in here.”

Flurin was literally and metaphorically shaken by Mr. Multin’s vigorous handshake. Once he was no longer being shaken like a pecan tree, he nodded. “I wasn’t expecting this level of integration. It’s… ambitious. You must be very proud of what you’ve done, Mr. Multin.”

Jesse’s grin widened. “Indeed I am! Ambition is what drives us, my friend. Oh, and, Mr. Multin was my father— Well, before he became His Majesty King Ignacio the Third. Call me Jesse! Now, come on—our conference room’s waiting, and I’ve got some numbers to show you that’ll blow your socks off.”

He turned on his heel, gesturing for us to follow. As we made our way to the elevators, Danny leaned in close, muttering under his breath. “Anybody else feel like they just walked onto a set? Or is that just me?”

I chuckled softly, shaking my head. “Get used to it. This is Jesse James Multin we’re talking about. Everything’s a performance.”

And just like that, we were off to the meeting that, knowing Jesse, would probably feel more like a whirlwind than a business discussion.

 

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: Five Minutes\]**

 

The conference room Jesse led us to was as sleek and polished as the lobby, with floor-to-ceiling windows showcasing a stunning view of downtown Atlanta. The table was long enough to seat at least twenty, but only five chairs were arranged near the head. A holographic screen was already displaying MultinPlex analytics in vibrant colors, the numbers scrolling and shifting in real-time.

Jesse slid into the seat at the head of the table and gestured for us to take the others. ""Alright, team,"" he began, clapping his hands together. ""Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let me just say one thing: Bravo. Absolutely brilliant work.""

I glanced at Danny, Max, and Flurin, all of whom looked just as puzzled as I felt. ""Thanks,"" I said hesitantly. ""But what specifically are we talking about?""

Jesse leaned back, a knowing smirk on his face. ""Come on, don’t be modest. The leak. That scene—the one where Erithe fights off the insurgents in her mecha? Pure adrenaline. It’s exactly what we needed to get people talking about *The Exterminators.*""

Flurin frowned, his brow furrowing. ""It wasn’t supposed to be available until the premiere last Sunday.""

""Exactly!"" Jesse said, pointing at him like he’d just solved a riddle. ""Which is why it was so brilliant to release it ‘accidentally.’ People love a good leak. Makes them feel like they’re in on a secret. And the best part? It had no real context—*just* enough action to hook viewers without giving away the story. Whoever orchestrated that, my hat’s off to you.""

I opened my mouth to explain that none of us had anything to do with it, but Jesse barreled ahead, not giving me the chance.

 

""Take a look at these numbers,"" he continued, gesturing to the holographic screen. ""MultinPlex viewership has skyrocketed. The premiere? Highest simultaneous viewing we’ve ever had since we started extraterrestrial service. And the chatter on Bleat and other platforms? Through the roof. Hashtags trending, fan theories galore—it’s a goldmine."" He was right. The graphs on the screen showed a massive spike in viewership and social media traffic in the days after the leak.

Danny shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his eyes darting to the screen and then to Jesse. ""So, you’re saying... you’re happy the scene leaked?""

""Happy?"" Jesse laughed, leaning forward. ""Mr. Foxton, I’m nothing short of ecstatic. This was marketing genius. And, if I may say, quite a calculated risk. It’s not every day a team has the guts to leak their own material, knowing it could backfire. But you pulled it off. I mean, come on, which one of you masterminds came up with it?""

There was a long pause as Jesse’s eyes flicked from me to Max to Danny and finally to Flurin.

""None of us did,"" I said finally, my voice steady. ""The leak wasn’t planned. We’ve just been trying to make the best of it.""

Jesse arched an eyebrow, his smirk growing. ""Oh, really?"" he said, drawing out the words. ""Interesting. Because it seems to me like someone on this team knew *exactly* what they were doing. I mean, look at that scene—action-packed, no spoilers, just enough to get people hyped. That doesn’t happen by accident.""

I felt a flicker of doubt but shook it off. Jesse was always like this—pushing, testing, looking for cracks in the façade.

""Well, whoever it was,"" Jesse said, leaning back with a satisfied sigh, ""you’ve got my gratitude. And my respect. This show is on track to become MultinPlex’s galactic flagship, and it’s all thanks to this team.""

Max exchanged a look with Flurin, who remained impassive. Danny, meanwhile, seemed to be sinking lower into his chair.

Jesse clapped his hands again, snapping us back to attention. ""Alright, that’s enough praise for now. Let’s talk next steps. But first..."" He turned to me, his expression shifting to something more serious. ""Jovi, can I steal you for a private word? Something important.""

I blinked, caught off guard. ""Uh, sure,"" I said, glancing at the others.

""Don’t worry,"" Jesse said with a grin. ""Won’t take long. Just need to discuss a couple of executive-level details.""

As I followed Jesse out of the room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something more going on. But with Jesse, there always was.

 

**\[Fast-Forwarding Transcript: One Minute\]**

 

Jesse’s executive office was everything you’d expect from the President of MultiVer Solutions: oversized, ostentatious, and oozing with charm designed to impress. The walls were lined with a mix of Earth and alien artwork, some abstract, some historical, and some purely decorative. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of Atlanta, stretching out beneath us like a glittering grid of ambition and opportunity.

Jesse gestured to a pair of leather armchairs situated around a glass coffee table, where a carafe of water and two glasses were already waiting. “Take a seat, Jovi. Make yourself comfortable.”

I sat, the chair swallowing me in plush comfort, while Jesse leaned against the edge of his desk, arms crossed, his polished demeanor still firmly in place.

“So,” he began, his voice measured and almost conspiratorial, “I wanted to have a little one-on-one with you. Strictly off the record.”

I raised an eyebrow. “What’s this about?”

Jesse smiled, the kind of smile that said he was about to sell you something. “Jovi, you’ve done an exceptional job with this show. The buzz, the viewership numbers—it’s all beyond what we could’ve hoped for.”

“Thanks,” I said, unsure where this was going.

“But,” he continued, tilting his head slightly, “I can’t help but wonder about the… circumstances that got us here. The leak, specifically.”

I sighed, already feeling defensive. “Like I said in the meeting, none of us had anything to do with it. We’ve just been rolling with the punches.”

Jesse’s smile widened, but there was something sharper in his eyes now. “Of course, of course. I believe you. But you’ve got to admit, it’s an interesting situation. These things don’t just happen out of thin air. Someone had access, someone made a choice. And it’s lucky for us it was such a *calculated* leak, don’t you think?”

I shrugged. “I guess? But like I said, it wasn’t us. Maybe someone higher up in the company decided to generate some buzz without telling us.”

Jesse laughed lightly. “Oh, Jovi. You’re a straight shooter, and I admire that about you. But sometimes, you’ve got to loỏ̶̮ʞ̶̹̍ ̵̦̏ɒ̶̪̈́ ̷̼̆l̷̀͜i̸̤͊Ɉ̸̫̓Ɉ̴̛͓l̵̢͝ɘ̷̳̔ ̵̪̑ɔ̴͕̂l̴̪̀o̶̜̚ƨ̶͕̍ɘ̸̳̽ɿ̵̰͐ ̴̘̇Ɉ̷̬̿ö̸̲ ̷̺̄ʜ̶͍͆o̴̳̾

The room felt hollow the moment Jovi and Jesse slipped out, and I had the uneasy sense that they’d taken the last bit of stable ground with them. I tried not to show it, but my stomach was in knots. Flurin’s restless tapping on the table only made things worse—each tap felt like a countdown to something I didn’t want to hear.

Max glanced from Flurin to me, as if assessing the damage before speaking. “Danny? Flurin has something to tell you.”

My chest tightened. I looked over at Flurin, who was busy staring at his own hands. His cheeks had that faint bluish flush that meant he was beyond nervous.

“Oh?” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “And what do you have to say?”

Flurin opened his mouth, shut it, then inhaled like he was about to dive into deep water- something I’m told actually happened during filming that got written into the episode. “A while back… during filming,” he began slowly, “Jovi told me about the post-credits scene from the pilot. The one you didn’t want to include. They… wanted my advice on how to convince you to keep it.”

I frowned, my mind immediately racing back to all the times Jovi and I had fought over them not telling me about the scene. “They did? So… why didn’t they tell me that?”

Flurin squirmed, his gaze flicking to Max as if begging for rescue. He seemed lost for words.

“Well, I… The fact is… umm—”

I felt a prickle of irritation, but more than that, dread. This was something big, and I could feel it in my gut. I waited for him to continue, but he just sat there looking like he wanted the floor to swallow him. That’s when Max spoke up, huffing in frustration.

 

“He told Jovi that if they told you anything about it,” she said, “he’d walk.”

Her words crashed over me like a bucket of ice. All I could do was stare, trying to comprehend what that meant. Slowly, the anger I expected never came. Instead, my heart sank. It was like watching a treasured plate from my grandmother’s wedding china hit the floor and shatter into a thousand pieces—beyond repair.

“You… put Jovi in that position?” My own voice sounded hollow. “Having to choose between me and you?”

For a moment, my eyes flicked to the door where Jovi had gone. In my head, I replayed the last month or so—every argument, every moment of mistrust. I’d accused Jovi of not respecting my legal knowledge, of brushing my advice aside. But now, it turned out they’d been stuck between a rock and a hard place, forced into silence by Flurin’s ultimatum. They hadn’t wanted to lie—maybe they’d just felt they had no choice.

Flurin’s head dropped, and he looked absolutely miserable. “I thought… I mean, I never planned for it to go so far. I was just… sure that scene was vital for the show, and I said it without thinking. I never realized it would… hurt you both like this.”

My throat tightened, a thousand half-formed thoughts and emotions tangling in my mind: betrayal, regret, a fierce protective instinct for Jovi. Mostly, though, I just felt an awful, sinking guilt for doubting Jovi’s apology before. They didn’t tell me about Flurin’s ultimatum, and it only took a brief moment for me to understand why:

 

It was because they didn’t want to deflect the blame. They really meant it when they told me they were sorry.

 

I swallowed hard and closed my eyes, trying to process it all. A month of confusion, unraveling in minutes. It hit me just how deeply Jovi must have been hurting—because of a decision Flurin made, and because I had refused to believe the sincerity of their apology, even if I never actually said anything.

Funny. Now all that frustration has nowhere to go.

 

Dammit.

 

We didn’t talk after that, not for a solid few minutes that felt like eternity.

I held my head in my hands.

*Now what? The only person who hasn’t made any stupid mistakes is Max, and I doubt she’ll do anything like that any time soon.*

 

But then the door opened, and Jovi and Mr. Multin stepped back into the room. Jovi looked… contemplative. Like Mr. Multin had given him something to chew on.

The rest of the meeting went by like a blur after that. Before I knew it, we had discussed New Orleans Comic Con, the set-up, the panel…

 

And before I knew it, Jovi was driving down to his hometown, and we were headed to the airport to fly to Baton Rouge.

 

~~I wish I had gone with him to Holcombville.~~

\[Jesse Multin:\] “Confirm Caller ID. Confirm Voice Print: *Dividir i conquerir, unir i liderar.*”

\[Automated Operator:\] “Confirmation received. Hello, Mr. Multin. Your sister will be with you shortly.”

\[ringing\]

\[Jane Multin:\] “Jay-Jay.”

\[Jesse:\] “Tweety-Bird. Got a moment?”

\[Jan:\] “Always, for my better half.”

\[Jesse:\] “Flatterer. You won the bet, by the way.”

\[Jan:\] “Oh? They didn’t pick up on what you were trying to say? But I have it on good word that Mr. Rosee is a very perceptive person who wasn’t the type to miss subtle hints, and Jesse Multin is the type to get his message across without needed to outright say anything.”

\[Jesse:\] “Okay, okay, you were right. My fast-talking got the better of me and they got nervous. I’ll give you the usual sum the next time we meet in person. The question now is, what do we do?”

\[Jan:\] “Fortunately, we have already explored this as a potential outcome.”

\[Jesse:\] “You keep coming up with increasingly creative ways to say ‘I told you so.’”

\[Jan:\] “What can I say? I write a lot of business emails. Since your attempt at subtly went over Mr. Rosee’s head, our next step is to simply tell them the truth.”

\[Jesse:\] “That we want Foxton gone? You know they’ll never accept that. In fact, I dare say they’d sooner quit than fire their best friend, and ultimately, we need Jovi's skills.”

\[Jan:\] “Not the *whole* truth. Just enough that they'll do what we need them to do. Tell him about Daniel compromising the drive, that I managed to intercept it before anything substantial was leaked, just omit that I purposely leaked the scene and that the original compromising was an accident. Foxton will look even more like a liability, Mr. Rosee will fire him, and Foxton won't compromise our plan.”

\[Jesse:\] “Well, that's going to be a problem. Foxton, Collingwood, and Flurin have already left for Baton Rouge, and Mr. Rosee is making their way to Holcombville for their family's Fourth of July party.”

\[Jan:\] “Fortunately, time is not of the essence here, and our paths will soon cross again. I'll make sure to tell Dad about the situation. We'll be in New Orleans with the nephews for ComicCon, and he can tell Mr. Rosee everything then.”

\[Jesse:\] “Fair enough. So, speaking of, how’s everything on your end? How’s Dad?”

\[Jan:\] “He’s… managing. Better with policy than politics, as always, but he’s kept things steady since the Kingdom was reformed. The Church is still a headache, though. They split from a temporal head once, odds are, they're brave enough to try again.""

\[Jesse:\] “When aren’t they? He’s lucky to have you running interference.”

\[Jan:\] “And you, for that matter. MultiVer’s reach keeps them from getting too bold. Speaking of, keep an eye on Jovi. We need them focused on the show, not Foxton or anything else. If they starts digging too deep…”

\[Jesse:\] “I’ll handle it. Don’t worry. You just focus on keeping Osca Hall in one piece.”

\[Jan:\] “Deal. And Jesse?”

\[Jesse:\] “Yeah?”

\[Jan:\] “Don’t forget my winnings. I like my victories sweetened.”

\[Jesse:\] “You’ll get your dollar, sis. I’m nothing if not a man of my word.”

\[Jan:\] “Good. Talk soon, Jay-Jay.”

\[Jesse:\] “Always, Tweety-Bird.”

\[Call ends.**\]**

**\[JJMultin, are you alright? Viewing certain memories, such as the approaching one, while experiencing high levels of stress may cause neurological side effects in both the user and patient.\]**

**\[Would you like to view a calmer memory from the patient?\]**

"Ziggurat Database, Lady Black Hat",Cityofheroes,1i99rtb,2025-01-24 18:53:30,30,0.94,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i99rtb,No-Age2887,Screenshot,"**Prisoner Number:** ZP-0913  
**Real Name:** Vivian Moretti  
**Alias:** Lady Black Hat  
**Origin:** Paragon City, USA  
**Status:** High-risk inmate, currently incarcerated at The Ziggurat, awaiting trial  

---

#### **Background:**
Vivian Moretti was the cunning and ambitious daughter of Vincent Moretti, a feared mafia boss who ruled over Paragon City's criminal underworld. Though she longed to break free from the violent legacy of her family, her father forced her to oversee a secretive experiment in weaponizing dark matter. The experiment, fueled by greed and desperation, went horribly wrong when a rival gang stormed the facility. Amid the chaos, the unstable dark matter containment failed, engulfing Vivian in an explosion of shadowy energy. 

Instead of being killed, she was reborn, her body permanently infused with the essence of darkness itself. Betrayed by her family, who saw her as a monstrous liability, and hunted by rivals who feared her newfound powers, Vivian embraced her transformation and adopted the persona of **Lady Black Hat**. Using her cunning and resourcefulness, she rose to prominence, forming her own gang, the **Black Hats**, an elite criminal syndicate operating in the shadows. With a thirst for vengeance and an unyielding drive for power, Lady Black Hat built an empire of crime, leaving destruction in her wake.

---

#### **Criminal Activities:**
1. **Mass Killings & Assassinations:**
   - Lady Black Hat is responsible for the deaths of thousands, including civilians, law enforcement, and superheroes. Her shadow-infused assassins are notorious for eliminating targets without a trace, often leaving chilling messages in their wake. Notably, she orchestrated the high-profile assassination of the hero **Radiant Guardian**, luring him into a trap with a false hostage situation and using her darkness powers to overwhelm him.

2. **Bank Robberies & Heists:**
   - She has masterminded numerous high-profile bank robberies, stealing billions of dollars to fund her empire. Her gang uses advanced stealth tactics, disabling security systems with dark energy and disappearing into the shadows before authorities can respond.

3. **City Takeover:**
   - In one of her most infamous crimes, Lady Black Hat and the Black Hats successfully seized control of the city of Steelport for an entire week. During this time, they implemented martial law, turning the city into a fortress of fear. The operation resulted in a staggering body count and left the city in ruins before heroes finally managed to liberate it.

4. **Arson & Sabotage:**
   - Known for sending a message through destruction, Lady Black Hat has orchestrated arson attacks on government buildings, police precincts, and even rival gang headquarters. Her mastery of shadow manipulation often allows her to ignite fires and cover her gang’s retreat in darkness, leaving her enemies in chaos.

5. **Torture & Psychological Warfare:**
   - Lady Black Hat revels in breaking her enemies mentally and physically. Known for her ruthless interrogation methods, she has extracted information from even the most hardened heroes and gang leaders. Survivors of her captivity often describe their experiences as nightmarish, haunted by whispers and shadows that seemed alive.

---

#### **Powers & Abilities:**

- **Shadow Manipulation:**
  - **Power Level:** 8/10  
  - Lady Black Hat can summon, control, and manipulate shadows to attack or defend. She creates tendrils of darkness that can constrict, cut, or incapacitate enemies. Her powers also extend to creating zones of pure darkness, disorienting her foes and giving her a tactical advantage in battle.

- **Stealth & Infiltration:**
  - **Power Level:** 9/10  
  - She uses her shadow powers to cloak herself and her allies, making them almost invisible in low-light conditions. Her ability to phase into shadows allows her to evade attacks, slip through barriers, and strike from unexpected angles.

- **Enhanced Reflexes & Agility:**
  - **Power Level:** 7/10  
  - Infused with dark matter, Lady Black Hat’s reflexes and agility are heightened, making her a nimble and elusive combatant. She excels at dodging attacks and performing acrobatic feats in battle.

- **Gang Leadership:**
  - **Power Level:** 10/10  
  - The **Black Hats** are a highly trained and loyal syndicate of assassins, saboteurs, and enforcers. Under her leadership, they have become one of the most feared criminal organizations, capable of rivaling any other gang or faction in the Rogue Isles.

- **Combat Skills:**
  - **Power Level:** 7/10  
  - While not a heavy hitter, Lady Black Hat is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter who relies on speed and precision. Her combat style incorporates her shadow powers, using them to distract or disable opponents while striking with surgical accuracy.

---

#### **Personality:**
Lady Black Hat is an ice-cold tactician with a chip on her shoulder. Her betrayal at the hands of her family and the underworld shaped her into a ruthless and vengeful individual. She thrives on control and uses fear as her greatest weapon, ensuring that both allies and enemies respect her authority. While she has a cruel streak, she is also charismatic, often persuading others to join her cause with promises of wealth and protection.

Her long-term goal is simple: to build a criminal empire so powerful that no one will dare to oppose her. However, her hatred for her family and the gangs that wronged her means she’ll stop at nothing to exact her revenge, even if it means tearing down entire cities.

---

#### **Weaknesses:**

- **Limited Power in Bright Light:**  
  Lady Black Hat’s shadow manipulation is significantly weaker in bright light or daylight. She requires darkness to fully utilize her abilities, making her vulnerable in well-lit environments.

- **Human Vulnerability:**  
  Despite her dark powers, Lady Black Hat’s body is still mostly human. She can be injured or killed with conventional means if caught off guard.

- **Overreliance on Her Gang:**  
  While her powers make her a formidable foe, much of her strength lies in the Black Hats. Disrupting her network or removing key members of her gang could severely weaken her operations.

---

**Notes for Authorities:**
Lady Black Hat is an incredibly dangerous individual who combines deadly powers with strategic brilliance. Any attempt to detain her must be conducted with extreme caution, as her ability to disappear into shadows makes her an expert at evading capture. Disabling light sources near her containment cell and closely monitoring her communications are critical for preventing escape attempts. Her influence and connections mean that even imprisonment may not stop her from continuing her criminal empire."

##**Gala**

The Villa Bianco stood like a jewel against the Milanese skyline, its Renaissance architecture glowing under a cascade of warm light. Surrounded by immaculately manicured gardens and marble fountains, the villa exuded wealth and power. Tonight, its grand halls were filled with the elite of Italian society. Oligarchs, landowners, military officers, and foreign dignitaries mingled beneath glittering chandeliers, their conversations blending into a soft hum of cultured voices. The scent of jasmine and expensive perfume lingered in the air, mingling with the occasional clink of crystal glasses. To most, it was a night of celebration, but to two agents of the Second Roman Republic, it was the stage for a dangerous game.

Among the crowd, **Livia Scaurus** moved gracefully, her emerald gown shimmering with each step. Tonight, she was not Livia Scaurus of the ***Speculatores***, but Silvia Bellini, the charming daughter of a wealthy industrialist. She appeared completely at ease, as though her only goal were to enjoy the evening—but her sharp eyes missed nothing. Every gesture, every stray word, every movement in the room was cataloged with the precision of a hunter tracking prey.

From his position near the bar, **Marcus Faustus** watched her with an air of detached amusement. Under his cover identity of Marco De Luca, an art dealer with a reputation for flamboyance, he played his part well. His tailored suit was impeccable, his posture relaxed, but his focus was razor-sharp. Calderone was the target, and Marcus’s every move was calculated to support Livia’s approach.

The target himself finally appeared, and his presence immediately shifted the atmosphere. **Vittorio Calderone**, silver-haired and charismatic, strode into the room with the confidence of a man accustomed to command. His tailored suit and polished shoes spoke of wealth, but it was his voice that captured attention. Deep and resonant, it carried effortlessly over the hum of conversation as he greeted his admirers and sycophants. Calderone had built a reputation as a visionary, a man who saw Italy’s future aligned with Japan. Tonight, he was the center of attention, and every move he made only solidified his image as a man of ambition.

*“Japan represents the future,”* Calderone declared, raising his glass to a small circle of influential figures. *“The Midnight Sun has given Italy the gift of her protection, her markets, her guidance. Italy must course-correct with her help so we can escape the stagnation of Europe and rise to greatness.”*

Livia drifted closer. She timed her approach carefully, allowing a natural opening before speaking. *“Signor Calderone,”* she said, *“your vision for Italy is truly inspiring. I couldn’t help but overhear.”*

Calderone turned, his chest puffing slightly with pride as he took in her striking appearance. *“Ah, a fellow believer in progress,”* he said with a warm smile. *“And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?”*

*“Silvia Bellini,”* she replied, extending her hand. *“I’m merely an observer tonight, but your ideas... they resonate deeply.”*

Calderone took her hand, his grip firm but lingering. *“It is rare to meet someone who truly understands the scope of what we could achieve. Perhaps you would indulge me with your thoughts?”*

Livia’s smile widened. *“It would be my pleasure.”*

***

##**Setup**

For the next twenty minutes, Calderone spoke passionately, his confidence growing with every word. Livia listened attentively, her emerald eyes locked on his, nodding at just the right moments to encourage him to continue.

*“Italy must break free from the chains of Europe’s decline,”* Calderone said. *“We cannot remain tethered to the outdated ideas that some, such as the exiled Italian puppets of the Greeklings, continue to advocate for. Italy's place is alongside Japan. Japan... Japan is the key. Their power, their innovation... It is exactly what we need to rebuild our strength.”*

*“You speak with such conviction, Signor Calderone,”* Livia said, tilting her head slightly. *“I can see why many are drawn to your vision.”*

*“Conviction,”* Calderone replied, lifting his glass, *“is what separates the leaders from the dreamers. And make no mistake, I intend to lead.”*

*“And what would that leadership look like? Surely you must have a plan.”*

Calderone hesitated for a moment, his eyes flickering around the room. Then, emboldened by Livia’s admiration and the wine he had been sipping, he leaned in slightly. *“There are... discussions underway,”* he admitted, lowering his voice. *“The Japanese representation in Italy and I share a vision of that would reshape our country. Together, Italy would be Japan's bulwark in Europe. A dedicated and willing partner, fully supported by her army, wealth, and wisdom. Italy would be unstoppable.* 

At the bar, Marcus watched the exchange closely. Disguised as Marco De Luca, he appeared disinterested, swirling his drink in its glass, but his attention was locked on Livia and Calderone. Subtly, he signaled the bartender, who nodded and began preparing Calderone’s next drink. The sedative, odorless and tasteless, was added with precision to the glass of Super Tuscan.

When Calderone turned to accept the drink, Livia raised her own glass in a toast. *“To bold visions,”* she said with a smile.

*“To the future of Italy,”* Calderone replied, grinning. He drank deeply, oblivious to the trap closing around him.

Within minutes, the sedative began to take effect. Calderone’s words slurred slightly, and he swayed on his feet. *“Excuse me,”* he mumbled, blinking rapidly. *“I... I’m not feeling well.”*

Livia stepped forward, her expression one of genuine concern. *“Oh no, let me help you,”* she said, steadying him. She gestured subtly to Marcus, who moved toward the exit to ensure their path was clear.

A uniformed Carabinieri officer, one of their operatives loyal to the Republic, approached. *“This gentleman needs medical attention,”* Livia said firmly.

The officer nodded. *“I’ll call for an ambulance immediately.”*

By the time Calderone was loaded into the vehicle, his head was lolling, his consciousness slipping away. Livia and Marcus watched as the ambulance, driven by resistance operatives, disappeared into the night.

*“Phase One is complete,”* Marcus said quietly..

Livia adjusted her shawl, her expression unreadable. *“Then let’s move. There’s more work to be done.”*

***

##**Extraction**

The ambulance, marked with the insignia of the Carabinieri, pulled away from the Villa Bianco with quiet efficiency. Inside, Calderone lay unconscious, his head rolling slightly with the movements of the vehicle. The two paramedics were resistance fighters in disguise. One of them adjusted the intravenous line that kept Calderone sedated, while the other monitored a portable device that scrambled tracking signals from any potential pursuers.

*“Route clear for the next ten kilometers,”* one of the paramedics said, his voice steady despite the tension in the air. He glanced toward Livia and Marcus, who sat in a separate vehicle following the ambulance. Both agents were silent, their focus sharp as they kept a watchful eye on their surroundings.

The convoy’s escape plan had been meticulously orchestrated. The Speculatores had mapped every inch of the route, identifying potential choke points and arranging contingencies for any unforeseen events. 

Resistance members had hacked into traffic control systems to manipulate signals, creating a seamless path through Milan’s labyrinthine streets. In the distance, a decoy ambulance, identical to the real one, sped toward the Austrian border, its false trail designed to divert any pursuing forces.

As the ambulance moved eastward, the cityscape gave way to the rolling hills of the Italian countryside. The moon cast a pale glow over the fields, illuminating the shadows of farmers working late into the night. These farmers, too, were part of the resistance network. Each subtle gesture—a raised hand, a tilt of a hat—served as a coded signal confirming that the path ahead was clear.

Inside the ambulance, Marcus monitored Calderone closely. His hand rested near the concealed weapon at his hip, ready to act should their target stir prematurely. He glanced at Livia, who sat with an air of poised control, her mind calculating the next steps.

*“If he stirs,”* Marcus said quietly, *“we end this here.”*

Livia’s emerald eyes flashed toward him. *“He won’t,”* she replied. *“The dosage is precise. Trust the plan.”*

The radio crackled to life, a coded message from a resistance cell stationed ahead. *“Checkpoint clear. Proceeding as planned.”*

The convoy adjusted its course, veering off the main road onto a dirt path that wound through a dense forest. The sound of the ambulance’s engine was muffled by the thick undergrowth, yet another layer of safety.

As they approached a clearing, the headlights illuminated a small, abandoned farmhouse. Resistance fighters emerged from the shadows, their faces obscured by scarves. They waved the ambulance forward, signaling that the first staging point had been reached.

Livia stepped out and approached the resistance leader, a grizzled man with a scar running down the side of his face. *“Status?”* she asked.

*“All quiet,”* the man replied. *“No sign of pursuit.”*

Together, they transferred Calderone to a waiting vehicle, an inconspicuous van loaded with supplies and outfitted with jamming equipment. The convoy resumed its journey, now weaving through backroads and avoiding any potential checkpoints.

Calderone’s unconscious form was strapped securely to a stretcher, his face pale under the dim light. Marcus glanced at him periodically, his expression unreadable. *“He looks too peaceful for a man selling his country out”* he muttered.

Livia’s gaze remained fixed on the horizon. *“He’ll find no peace where he’s going,”* she said coldly.

***

##**Extraction** *(Part 2)*

The convoy reached the Adriatic coast just as the first hints of dawn began to streak the sky with hues of indigo and violet. The air was heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed, mingling with the faint aroma of woodsmoke from nearby fishing villages. The small harbor was a hive of covert activity, with resistance fighters disguised as dock workers and fishermen loading crates onto weathered boats.

Livia and Marcus stepped out of the van, their boots crunching against the gravel path. The harbor’s dim lighting cast long shadows across the ground as they walked towards the shore. Calderone was carefully unloaded, his stretcher concealed beneath a tarpaulin.

*“Get him on the boat,”* Marcus ordered. Resistance operatives moved quickly. The Zodiac boat waiting at the dock was sleek and nearly silent, equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth motor designed to minimize detection.

Livia scanned the horizon with a pair of night-vision binoculars, her eyes narrowing as she surveyed the water. *“No movement. Coast is clear,”* she confirmed.

The boat came to life, cutting through the calm waters with precision. Above them, a drone buzzed softly, its infrared camera providing a bird’s-eye view of their surroundings. The operators at Speculatores headquarters monitored the feed closely, ready to relay any signs of trouble.

Halfway to their rendezvous point a sharp beam of light pierced the darkness, sweeping across the water. An Italian naval patrol boat loomed in the distance, its searchlight scanning for any signs of suspicious activity. This was a stretch of water commonly used by refugees fleeing to the SRR and by Roman smugglers moving product to Italian black markets.

Marcus reached for his weapon instinctively, but Livia stopped him with a firm hand. *“Not yet,”* she said. *“Let’s see if we can outmaneuver them first.”*

She grabbed the radio, her voice calm but urgent. *“Falco to Nereus, we have a situation. Need a distraction.”*

From a hidden position on the coastline, a resistance-controlled signal station intercepted the patrol boat’s communications. Within moments, a false distress signal was sent, reporting an emergency further north. The patrol boat hesitated, its searchlight lingering on the water for a few agonizing seconds before turning away. The vessel changed course, heading toward the fabricated emergency

*“Crisis averted,”* Livia said, exhaling softly. She glanced at Marcus, who nodded in approval.

***

##**Lacrimosa**

The Zodiac boat sped across the Adriatic waters, its stealth motor humming faintly beneath the quiet lapping of waves. The horizon was a canvas of stars, unmarred by moonlight, giving the scene an eerie, infinite quality. Livia’s sharp eyes scanned the water, while Marcus sat beside Calderone’s unconscious form, one hand on his weapon and the other gripping the boat’s edge.

They reached the rendezvous point—a desolate patch of open sea where no lights pierced the darkness, save for the faint glow of the stars above. For several ominous minutes, there was nothing but the sound of water sloshing against the boat. The drone overhead provided live surveillance to Speculatores headquarters, but even its feed revealed only empty ocean.

*“Where are they?”* Marcus muttered, his voice tight with impatience.

Livia held up a hand, silencing him. She tilted her head, listening intently. Then, like a shadow emerging from the depths, a massive submarine surfaced silently before them. Its silhouette was imposing, a leviathan of steel and stealth. The name ***""Lacrimosa""*** was faintly visible along its side, painted in dark lettering that seemed to absorb the faint light around it.

The hatch on the submarine remained closed as if it were sizing up the boat and its occupants. Livia reached for the flashlight tucked into her jacket, its beam cutting through the darkness in sharp, deliberate bursts. She tapped out a message in Morse code: 

***""Remus has arrived at the Aventine.""***

For a moment, there was only silence. Then, from the submarine’s deck, another light flashed in response: 

***""Romulus awaits.""***

Livia nodded to Marcus. *“That’s the signal.”*

The hatch of the Lacrimosa opened with a faint hiss, and two figures emerged, [dressed in the matte black uniforms. Their faces were obscured by masks](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9z-Ayos01LLBDJ_dFrnH3J5D3w3YfNhmJBJq7qVex_xLO_cfeZBGYvbUtkXAuJupoP6Jw4HuoW7lK1ZWABMgfUONdUpKc0ExtqTa38eAFyx2aZjk_eaDJI-d6n9DJODRpkNDlEPH), and their movements were deliberate, almost mechanical. They gestured for the boat to come closer, their body language betraying no emotion.

Marcus and Livia guided the Zodiac alongside the submarine. The operatives aboard extended a platform, securing the boat to the larger vessel.

*“Hand him over,”* one of the operatives ordered, his voice distorted through the mask’s comm system.

Livia and Marcus worked quickly, lifting Calderone’s stretcher and passing it to the waiting operatives. The unconscious man was carried into the Lacrimosa’s interior without ceremony, disappearing into the submarine’s shadowy depths.

As Livia moved to follow, one of the operatives stepped in her path. *“Your mission ends here,”* he said flatly. *“You are not authorized to board.”*

Marcus bristled, *“We were told to ensure his transfer personally.”*

*“And you have,”* the operative replied. *“Your orders now are to return to Milan. Monitor the fallout. Observe and report back on the power vacuum Calderone’s absence will create.”*

Livia placed a calming hand on Marcus’s arm. *“Understood,”* she said smoothly, her voice betraying no frustration. *“We will return to Milan and await further instructions.”*

The operatives offered no further words. With a final, sharp gesture, they retracted the platform and secured the hatch. The Lacrimosa began its descent, the water swallowing it whole. Within moments, the vast submarine had disappeared, leaving the Zodiac alone in the endless expanse of the Adriatic.

Marcus exhaled sharply, staring at the now-empty sea. *“I don’t like this. They could at least let us see it through.”*

Livia shook her head. *“We’ve done our part. Now it’s up to them.”* She glanced at the horizon, her expression unreadable. *“Let’s get back to Milan. The real game starts now.”*
With that, she guided the boat back toward the coastline, the hum of its stealth motor fading into the vast, open waters.

***

##**Interrogation**

The ***Lacrimosa*** glided through the inky depths of the Adriatic, its sleek hull cutting silently through the water. Inside, the submarine's cold, dimly lit corridors thrummed with subdued activity. Calderone was transferred from the medical bay to a secure holding cell upon arrival at the ***Occasus Solis***. Located on the seabed, the base was an engineering marvel—a sprawling network of chambers and tunnels designed to intimidate as much as it was to secure Rome's most sensitive operations.

Calderone’s holding cell was stark and oppressive. The walls were constructed of reinforced steel, their surfaces faintly gleaming under the pale, flickering light of overhead bulbs. Outside the cell, armed guards stood at attention, their faces obscured by masks. Calderone’s unconscious body was strapped to a steel gurney, his wrists and ankles bound tightly with restraints.

Hours passed. When Calderone finally stirred, his head throbbed, and his vision swam as he adjusted to the harsh light. The room was sterile and cold, the silence so absolute it seemed to press against his ears. Panic set in as he tried to move, only to find his limbs immobilized. He tugged at the restraints, but the steel held firm.

*“Good morning, Signor Calderone,”* a smooth, honeyed voice greeted him from the shadows.

Calderone’s eyes darted toward the source of the voice. A tall, impeccably dressed man stepped into the light. His suit was midnight black, tailored perfectly to his slender frame, and his tie was blood red. He carried himself with a calculated elegance, his hands clasped loosely behind his back. His pale, sharp features were framed by slicked-back dark hair, and his piercing eyes seemed to study Calderone as if he were a particularly fascinating specimen.

*“Who… who are you?”* Calderone croaked, his voice hoarse.

The man’s lips curled into a smile. *“You may call me [***Sejanus***](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e4/3b/34/e43b347b3bf84f57d1c3107e9004ecb0.jpg). I have the distinct honor of serving as Prefect of the Custodiae Aeternae. Think of me as… the guardian of Rome’s secrets.”*

Sejanus moved closer, his polished leather shoes clicking softly against the floor. He gestured around the room with a sweeping motion of his hand. *“Welcome to your new home. The Occasus Solis is a remarkable place, don’t you think? So quiet. So isolated. The perfect setting for… intimate conversations.”* His voice dripped with mockery, each word carefully chosen to unsettle.

Calderone strained against his restraints again, his breaths coming in shallow gasps. *“You have no right to detain me! I… I am a powerful man - a close ally of Japan! The world will—”*

Sejanus chuckled. *“Ah, but Calderone, here beneath the waves, the world is a very distant concern. No one will come looking for you, and even if they did, they would find nothing. You are quite alone.”* He leaned in closer. *“But don’t worry. I’ll be keeping you company. I’ve been looking forward to getting to know you better.”*

Calderone’s fear twisted into anger. *“You’ll never get anything from me! I know how these things work. You can’t break me.”*

Sejanus’ smile widened, his teeth gleaming. *“Break you? My good sir, you misunderstand. I’m not here to break you – not yet at least. I’m here to understand you. To peel back the layers of your ambition, your motives, your… dreams.”* 

He straightened and began to pace slowly around the gurney. *“Tell me, why Japan? Why tie your future to theirs when history has shown that such alliances often end… poorly?”*

Calderone glared at him, his jaw clenched. *“Japan represents progress, strength. They don’t meddle in our affairs like the Germans did. They respect us.”*

Sejanus’s eyebrows rose, feigning interest. *“Respect. Fascinating. And do you truly believe their interest in Italy stems from respect, or is it perhaps… convenience? A stepping stone to greater ambitions in Europe, perhaps?”*

Calderone shifted uncomfortably. *“I don’t have to explain myself to you.”*

Sejanus stopped pacing. *“Oh, but you will. You will tell me everything. Your plans for Italy, your dealings with the Japanese, … all of it. And if you refuse, well, let’s just say… the depths of this facility offer many ways to encourage cooperation.”*

*“Rest well,”* Sejanus said, turning toward the door. *“We’ll continue this conversation soon. And do try to be cooperative. It would be such a shame to waste all this… potential.”*

As the door hissed shut behind him, Calderone was left alone with his thoughts, the faint hum of the base’s machinery the only sound in the oppressive silence.

***

##**Interrogation** *(Part 2)*

Sejanus returned the next day. This time, however, the faint trace of mockery had vanished from his expression. His tone was colder, more calculated, as he set down a small silver case on the table beside Calderone’s gurney.

*“Shall we begin again?”* Sejanus said simply.

Calderone scowled but said nothing. His body still ached from the electrical shocks delivered during the course of the night. He knew better than to show weakness, but the pain made his resolve waver.

Sejanus pulled up a chair and sat down across from him. *“I’ve been reviewing what little you’ve shared so far,”* he said, opening the case to reveal a series of syringes, vials, and instruments. *“And I must say, while I admire your stubbornness, it is ultimately... futile.”*

Calderone struggled against his restraints. *“You won’t get any more from me. Torture me all you want.”*

Sejanus gave a small, humorless laugh. *“Oh, this isn’t torture. Not yet.”* He selected a vial, drew its contents into a syringe, and held it up to the light. *“This is simply persuasion.”*

The next hour was a brutal cycle of questions, refusals, and physical punishment. Sejanus wielded his tools with clinical precision, inflicting just enough pain to weaken Calderone’s defenses but not break him entirely. Each time Calderone resisted, the punishments escalated. Sweat dripped down his forehead, his breaths ragged, but still, he held out.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Calderone gasped, *“Fine! I’ll tell you.”*

Sejanus leaned back in his chair, folding his hands neatly in his lap. *“Go on.”*

*“I... I wanted to take advantage of the chaos,”* Calderone confessed. *“The [chemical weapon scandal](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1f19jf3/alert_ave_rome_the_midnight_sun/), the political instability—it created an opening. With Japan's help, I could consolidate power and reshape Italy into a strong, proud nation once more.”*

Sejanus nodded slowly. *“An opportunist. Ambitious. Pragmatic. I must admit, I find your methods impressive.”*

Calderone blinked, taken aback. *“You... you agree with me?”*

*“Only in principle,”* Sejanus replied, his tone softening slightly. *“You see, [chaos is a ladder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDjNcqQs1yM). It is the ambitious who climb it while the weak are consumed by it. In that regard, you and I are alike.”*

For a fleeting moment, Calderone felt a spark of hope. But it was extinguished when Sejanus leaned forward. *“But you forgot one crucial element,” he said.*

Calderone’s throat tightened. *“What element?”*

Sejanus’s lips curved into a thin smile. *“Your plan was against the interests of the Republic.""*

He stood, straightening his suit as he spoke. *“The Italian people are suffering. They are angry, humiliated, betrayed. And that anger must have a direction. Japan is the perfect target. The people must hate them. They must feel the weight of betrayal so that, when the time comes, they will welcome their liberators—the Romans—with open arms.”*

Calderone stared at him, the weight of his words sinking in. *“You’re manipulating them. Using their pain to justify your agenda.”*

*“Precisely,”* Sejanus said without hesitation. *“It’s called strategy. Something you clearly lack.”*

*“How does this fit the Second Roman Republic’s grand vision?”* Calderone spat, his voice hoarse but steady. 

*“You claim to be a bastion of liberty and freedom, a torch of hope in a sea of darkness. Yet here I am, bound and tortured in the shadows and you condemn the Italian people to suffering. Tell me, Prefect, where does this fit into your ethos?”*

Sejanus chuckled and stepped closer to the gurney, clasping his hands behind his back. 

*“Oh, Calderone, you’ve mistaken the symphony for a single note. You see, people will fight their oppressors so long as the hatred for their overlords and the hope for a better future outweigh the consequences of their rebellion. The public image of the Republic… that provides the hope. My people provide the hatred. And the tools to fight back. Simple as that.”*

Calderone’s face twisted with disgust. *“How can you live with yourself, knowing you’ve turned your ideals into nothing but a facade?”*

*“Live with myself? Calderone, I thrive. I don’t submit to terror; I make the terror. The deck is stacked, and the rules are rigged. The Italian people don’t know what’s best for them. I do. They’re like little children—we have to hold their sticky fingers and wipe their filthy mouths. Teach them right from wrong. Tell them what to think and how to feel… and, most importantly, what to want - liberation by their fellow Roman compatriots. They even need help writing their wildest dreams, crafting their worst fears. Lucky for them, they have me.”*

Calderone strained against his restraints, rage boiling beneath his fear. *“You’re a monster.”*

Sejanus straightened, his face an unreadable mask of calm. *“No, Calderone. I am necessity made flesh. For those of us climbing to the top of the food chain, there can be no mercy. There is but one world—hunt or be hunted. Cry havoc, said he who fought chaos with chaos, and let slip the dogs of war. You think I’m cruel? War is cruel. Fear is cruel. Brutal. Total. Us Romans know that all to well. While you Italians have lived under the boot for decades, we Romans bled to preserve what we have.”*

*“The road to greatness is paved with hypocrisy and casualties. You’d know that if you were half the man you pretend to be. But let me make one thing perfectly clear: we are done trying to win over people’s hearts. The time for that has passed. We must be ruthless with those who hate us.*

Calderone’s breath quickened as Sejanus’s words pressed into him like the crushing depths of the ocean outside. *“You can’t control people forever,”* he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. *“Eventually, they will rise against you.”*

Sejanus stopped pacing, standing at the foot of the gurney. His eyes bore into Calderone’s, icy and unrelenting. *“Control? Who said anything about control? I don’t need their obedience. I need their desperation. Their pain. Their anger. People are at their most useful when they’re desperate. And when the time comes, they will do exactly what I need them to do… without even realizing it.”*

With that, Sejanus left and Calderone was left alone in the suffocating silence, the weight of Sejanus’s words pressing down on him like the crushing depths of the Adriatic. Above the waves, the world spun on, oblivious to the brutal machinations unfolding beneath its surface

***

##**Absolution**

After days of torture and interrogation, Calderone was a broken man. He had given all there was to give. But once again, the door hissed open. It was different this time however, Sejanus was accompanied by two masked guards. *“Take him,”* he said coldly.

Calderone was dragged through dimly lit corridors, his restrained body jostled as the guards marched in perfect, unfeeling rhythm. They entered a cavernous room, dimly illuminated by the eerie glow of overhead lights. Calderone’s eyes widened in horror. Before him stretched rows upon rows of crucified figures, their bodies twisted and lifeless. Slayer officers captured during the Byzantine war, spies from the Garden, and countless nameless enemies of the Republic hung in grotesque silence. The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the stench of death.

Sejanus followed at a measured pace, his hands clasped behind his back. He stopped beside Calderone and gestured toward the grim tableau. *“Behold, the price of subverting the Republic. You are in illustrious company.”*

Calderone began to tremble, his lips moving in silent prayer.

***“Crucify him,”*** Sejanus commanded his subordinates, his voice as sharp and unyielding as tempered steel.

One of the guards hesitated, glancing cautiously at Sejanus.

Sejanus turned his gaze on the man, his expression devoid of mercy. 

*“We are all ruthless. We destroy.* ***We are at war, he is an enemy combatant and will be treated as such. Now obey.”***

The guard nodded hastily, stepping forward to carry out the order.

Calderone’s prayer grew louder, desperate, a plea for salvation. Sejanus leaned in close, his breath cold against Calderone’s ear.

*“There is no solace above or below,”* he murmured, his voice almost tender. *“The Midnight Sun will set, and it will give way to a Roman Dawn.”*

As Calderone was dragged away to his fate, Sejanus turned to one of his officers. 

*“I want him obliterated,”* he said. *“More than that—let’s make him suffer.”*

The officer saluted, and the room was once again filled with the sounds of footsteps and muffled cries. Sejanus watched impassively, the faintest smile curling at the corner of his lips as the wheels of his brutal machine ground forward, unrelenting and unstoppable.

Sejanus offered the following parting words to Calderone.

***“There is only fury under my Eagle.”***"

I understand that the fees will be paid in XRP, but at such an incrementally fractional amount, this would either #1 have no substantial bearing on the utility value of XRP (outside of the massive spike in price that would occur, though this would inherently be 99% in part due to hype/sentiment rather than practical application in terms of utility revenue), or #2 the price of XRP rose so substantially that quickly due to the hype caused by initial institutional adaptation that it would suddenly make the operating costs and spread %'s of utilizing the network less attractive, which in theory would then simply equate to a lesser demand for use and in turn result in a drop back down on the price of individual XRP again?

I don't pretend to be an expert in this, but if someone with a wider array of expertise on the subject wouldn't mind shedding some insight (and not one of these ""MOOOON!!!"" fools) I would be grateful for the clarification."

This was easier to write substantionally but it was very difficult to find a right tone to convey the *feeling* that is central to my understanding of Verbena: steady, direct, rough, and resilient.

# Part 1: The Living World - Verbena Paradigm

## Ancient Blood, Modern Flow

Reality throbs with life force - visceral, raw, and ever-present. Feel it in your own heartbeat, in the rush of blood through your veins, in the heat of sexual arousal, in the sharp copper taste of blood on your tongue, in the surge of adrenaline during birth or battle. This is what Norse vitki felt flowing as önd through their bodies, what Greek physicians traced as pneuma coursing through brain, heart, and liver. Every culture has recognized these currents of power: Egyptian priests mapping the ka's flow through body and tomb, Finnish tietäjät sensing väki in stone and storm, Igbo dibia tracking chi through bloodlines and community.

Our power flows like sap through a great tree - from deep roots through ancient trunk into ever-new branches. Like the galli priests of Cybele whose sacred bleeding transformed flesh and spirit alike, like the völur whose seiðr reshaped the boundaries of perception and possibility, we carry forward living traditions that grow and adapt. The Craft lives in muscle memory - in hands that know the right moment to harvest, in breath that naturally aligns with power during ritual, in bodies that recognize sacred timing encoded in blood and bone.

## The Dance of Blood and Breath 

Blood speaks in many tongues of power. Through monthly flows, practitioners attune to earth's tides, their bodies moving in rhythm with forces that pull at ocean and womb alike. Norse blót ceremonies feed land-spirits and gods, maintaining ancient bonds through freely given offerings. Greek pharmakoi channel community purification through blood and sacrifice. Birth blood heralds new power entering the world, while death blood marks transitions between states of being.

Before there were cities, before agriculture, before metal and writing, there was the visceral knowledge of life force moving through flesh and world. You feel it in your bones when you shape clay with your hands, when you spin fiber into thread, when you tend fire, when you birth a child. Every human craft echoes this first knowing - the primal understanding of how power flows through matter and spirit. The spells of a witch are as precise as a surgeon's cuts, each action building on generations of hard-won wisdom.

## The World Tree and Web of Life

Reality branches like the world trees of our ancestors - Yggdrasil's nine worlds hanging in complex relation, the Finnish world-pillar connecting sky, middle-realm, and underworld, the sacred trees rising from wells of wisdom in Celtic lands. Each tradition sees these patterns through its own eyes, finding truth in forms shaped by land and experience. We exist within webs of connection mapped differently by different peoples, yet no less real for their varying shapes.

These ancient patterns echo in watershed and mycorrhizal web, in bloodline and spirit-bond, in cycles of moon and season, in the very networks of root and branch that sustain forests. The Norse saw this in Yggdrasil's roots drinking from wells of fate, the Finns in how väki flowed through stone and storm, the Greeks in pneuma's circulation through body and world. Now we see it too in how wolves shape rivers, how rivers shape mountains, how mountains shape weather - each perspective adding depth to our understanding without replacing what came before.

## Life's Dance of Creation and Destruction

Life and death move in patterns as old as existence itself. The Norse völur knew how fylgja and hamr reshape themselves through death and dream, how the dead whisper wisdom to those who know how to listen. Greek mystery cultists found divine knowledge in death's threshold, while Egyptian priests maintained intricate relationships between ka, ba, and body that transcended death's boundary. Each tradition recognizes how destruction feeds creation - the seed breaking to sprout, the prey feeding predator, the old growth burning so the forest can renew.

These forces dance through all things - in the push-pull of tides, in waxing and waning moon, in lightning seeking earth, in how healing plants hold both medicine and poison in their flesh. The Finnish tietäjät knew this in how väki could heal or harm depending on how it was approached. Egyptian priests understood it through Sekhmet's power to bring both plague and healing. These aren't simple opposites but interwoven aspects of reality's endless becoming.

## Knowledge Through Blood and Bone

True knowing comes through bone-deep experience, through hands stained with herb juices and burial soil, through nights spent in trance beside sacred fires, through voices grown hoarse with chanting, through skin marked by ritual scars. The Greek mystery cultists found wisdom in ecstatic dance, Finnish healers learned through direct communion with väki, Egyptian priests gained power through precise ritual embodiment of divine forces.

This knowledge lives in how a healer's hands remember the feel of fever and health, in how a midwife's body recognizes birth's rhythms, in how a witch's tongue knows the taste of powerful plants. Understanding flows through physical engagement with blood, sex, birth, and death. The Norse god Odin gained wisdom through bodily sacrifice, hanging wounded on Yggdrasil. Egyptian ka-priests maintained divine power through precise ritual actions. We continue this tradition of embodied knowing, understanding that power flows most truly through blood and breath and bone.

# Part 2: Blood and Breath - Verbena Practices

## Sexual Practice and Life Force

Sexual magick works through understanding of life force's currents and tides. Greek mystery traditions knew this through their sacred marriages and Dionysian rites, where sexual energy opened gateways to divine realms. Norse seiðr practitioners worked with sexual energy's power to reshape consciousness and reality. Finnish tietäjät understood how sexual forces could strengthen or weaken magickal workings, requiring careful observation of taboos and timing.

Feel how energy builds between partners, how breath and movement align with universal rhythms, how altered states break down barriers between worlds. This isn't about pleasure alone but about engaging primal forces that shape reality. Like the ancient practitioners who recognized sexual power in spring rites and harvest ceremonies, we understand how these energies connect with greater cycles of creation and transformation.

## Spirit Work and Healing Arts

Our relationships with spirits grow from deep roots into new forms. Finnish tietäjät maintained complex relationships with nature spirits, the dead, and healing forces. Norse volur worked with fylgjur and landvættir, understanding how different types of spirits required different approaches. Greek healing temples developed precise protocols for divine healing through dream and ritual.

These traditions continue in evolved forms. Modern practitioners tend relationships with ancestors in urban apartments, work with land spirits in concrete parks, bond with animal spirits in changing ecosystems. The healing arts flow through our hands - in herbalism that remembers plants' traditional uses while understanding their chemistry, in midwifery that carries forward ancient wisdom while embracing new knowledge, in bone-setting that recalls the body's deep patterns while understanding its mechanics.

## Sacred Space and Place

Every place pulses with its own life, its own spirits, its own patterns of power. Finnish tradition recognized different types of väki dwelling in forest, stone, water, and fire. Norse practitioners mapped landscapes through their relationships with landvættir and burial mounds. Greek temples were built where chthonic powers rose close to the surface, while Egyptian sacred sites aligned with stellar and terrestrial forces.

These patterns persist and evolve. Cities thrum with their own rhythms, their own spirit roads, their own power nodes. Abandoned lots burst with pioneer plants carrying old healing knowledge, urban beehives maintain ancient connections between worlds, subway tunnels channel underworld energy. We work with sacred space as it lives now - recognizing how old powers adapt to new forms, how spirits inhabit modern structures, how ancient practices find new expression.

## The Living Spell - A Working Example

Consider a working to heal a critically ill child. The intent seems simple - restore health, drive out sickness. But through our understanding, this becomes a complex working drawing on multiple traditions and powers.

First comes diagnosis through blood and bone. The healer's hands read fever-hot skin and racing pulse, feeling how illness disrupts life force's flow through the body. Like the Egyptian priests who understood ka's movement through the body, like Finnish healers who could sense how väki had become harmful, the practitioner reads multiple levels of disruption - physical symptoms, energy blockages, spirit influences.

The working draws on generations of tested knowledge. Yarrow gathered as the morning star rises carries väki of sky and iron, strengthening the body's boundaries. Elderflower harvested at twilight holds power over thresholds, helping shift harmful patterns. The healer times the working to moon's waxing strength, understanding like the Greek physicians how celestial forces affect bodily humors.

The physical components reflect deeper patterns. The herbal bath becomes like the healing waters of ancient temple springs. Three drops of freely given blood create bridges between healer and patient, like the Norse blood-bonds that linked fates. Sacred sounds recall how Finnish healers used specific songs for specific illnesses. The drum-rhythm matches healthy heartbeat, giving disrupted systems a pattern to remember.

Other traditions would see this working differently. A Hermetic might perceive realignment of elemental forces, a Chorister divine grace flowing through faith. But our way works through visceral connection - through touch and breath, through blood and bone, through patterns passed down in muscle memory. We heal by engaging directly with life's raw forces, by understanding how power flows through physical reality in all its forms.

This is how all our workings manifest - through bone-deep knowing, through flesh serving as a channel for power, through direct manipulation of life force itself. Whether healing or harming, blessing or cursing, creating or destroying, the principles remain the same: power flows through blood, breath, and bone, through the primal forces expressed in every aspect of existence."

Bitcoin Today 01/24/2025: Chinese New Year could see Bitcoin rise by 20%?,CapitalistExploits,1i8wjl2,2025-01-24 09:25:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i8wjl2/bitcoin_today_01242025_chinese_new_year_could_see/,kayakero,,"Thanks to the actions and statements of US President Donald Trump, Bitcoin (BTC) registered a 4.1% increase in the last 24 hours. This increase took the cryptocurrency from $101,000 to a high of $105,401 this Friday, January 24.

On the one hand, Trump signed an executive order on Thursday 23 establishing the start of the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. This order requires the development of a legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector and the advancement of the construction of this strategic reserve.

Although this reserve will include other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin, the announcement was enough to excite the market.

Meanwhile, in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump reiterated his intention to turn the United States into the “global cryptocurrency capital.”

Both stocks boosted the broader market, with Solana (SOL) standing out as a 9.2% gainer among the top cryptocurrencies. Ethereum (ETH), meanwhile, rose 6.8% to $3,400.

# Bitcoin could skyrocket

Bitget analyst Rafael Bonventi noted that Bitcoin is still in a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, describing it as a “chart ping-pong.” However, his analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency is consolidating a solid base, which could anticipate a significant upward movement.

The analyst is optimistic about the medium and long term, highlighting an 80% probability that Bitcoin will start a new upward trend.

>

Interestingly, one of the catalysts for this surge could be the Chinese New Year, which has historically driven up the price of Bitcoin.

# The “Year of the Snake”

In 2025, the Chinese New Year will be celebrated on January 29. This holiday, whose date varies according to the cycles of the Moon, has been a catalyst for increases in the cryptocurrency market. In 11 of the last 12 years, Bitcoin has recorded a positive performance during this period.

A report from Matrixport notes that Bitcoin has performed bullishly during 83% of Chinese New Years. According to the firm, the price of BTC is likely to see a 21% increase during this festive period.

The report attributes this trend to increased buying and trading activity as families and investors often exchange gifts and funds, which increases the demand for Bitcoin. As such, the price of BTC is expected to reach new highs during these holidays.

Sunny drove on in silence, the whining of the overloaded cart the only noise in the hall. Every bump in the cart was amplified by the increased gravity; Nick had a real worry he’d fall off if she hit a bump wrong.



“Hey,” Sunny said, snapping her fingers while frowning, trying to remember something. “You, human with the cybernetics, Nate… Norm… Newman?”



“Nick.” He said and frowned. “Sunny, you *know* my name.” 



“Can’t be bothered Norman. Listen, go and hack the local network to get control of the gravity generators down here. You probably can’t get all of Hyacinth, but if you get some along our route, we can go faster.”



“But, won’t that just make it harder?” Nick said, and stared straight ahead, gripping the handles in front of him tightly. The motion combined with the centripetal force was making him even more nauseous.



“Idiot! If I didn’t think it would knock you out, I’d smack you. Gravity generators go *both ways*. Just make ones near us push back instead of pull down.”



Nick turned inward and reached out to the local network. He found that with Raaden’s encryption keys, it was much easier to get deeper into Hyacinth’s systems. Why would she have that kind of access? Even as the President of Houndstooth, it wasn’t necessary. Reaching past the normal cameras and HVAC, he found the gravity network. There, along their path was a massive generator. It appeared that nobody had even connected to it in… that can’t be right. Nobody had connected to it in a century. Talk about set it and forget it. Nick connected and adjusted it.



Immediately they sped up, and the cart’s protesting whine quieted. Eastern sat up, blinking, and Selkirk’s fur rippled. “What happened?”



“Sunny asked me to connect to one of the gravity generators near us,” Nick said. “I turned it in reverse and it’s counteracting the centripetal force from the spin.”



“Well that explains why I’m still super dizzy” Sel said, and sat up. “But at least I don’t feel like I’m dying anymore. Nice work Nick.”



“It was Sunny’s idea, thank her.”



Selkirk’s ears flicked and she shrugged with one shoulder. “Thanks Sun-”



“Don’t.” Sunny said, her eyes locked on the path ahead. “*Don’t* thank me. I’m just doing something that Gord told me to do so I can get off this deathtrap.” Nick looked at Sunny, but she would not meet their gaze. She stared straight ahead, her jaw set, her hands gripping the wheel very tightly. 



After about five minutes of riding, there was another rumble, seemingly coming from everywhere and a lurch. Nick took a look on the local network, and saw the commotion from Hyacinth Support. “Looks like they’re applying braking thrust now,” He said. “Chatter on the support network is that they don’t know who turned on the spin engines, nobody who supposedly has access has fessed up.”



Eastern looked at nick. “Raaden Voiced someone.” She said, firmly.



Selkirk nodded. “Probably. As if she wasn’t serious enough about finding us.”



“Well, lucky for you, we’re here.” Sunny said as she slowed the cart. There was a floor to ceiling wall, and in the center was a large pressure door. “This is the maintenance entrance to the base. Go inside and check in with Selamaine shipping. Tell them you want to hire Tinker Toy.” 



“Tinker Toy?” Nick repeated as he and the others got off the cart.



“Don’t repeat me, you’re not a mimic.” Sunny snapped. “Tink will haul you where you need to go. Especially if tall, pale, and shapely there does the asking.” She said, gesturing to Eastern.



“I’m not that tall…” Eastern muttered. She was 180 centimeters to Nicks 167 and Selkirk’s 150. Luna residents were always taller due to the lower gravity.



“Whatever. I’m gone. This time I *mean* it. Don’t come looking for me.” She started a three point turn in the cart.



“You were the one who found *us* Sunny.” Selkirk said as she sped away.



“Fuck yoooou!” Sunny called back as she zoomed back down the hall.



The base of Hyacinth was a massive area, miles across. The center was filled with  machinery that helps keep Hyacinth operational and comfortable, then there was an inner ring of embassies and administrative offices, an middle ring of shopping, hotels and restaurants catering to off station guests, and a lower,-outer ring of docks for starships, the upper-outer ring being the ramps to Hyacinth proper. Nick opened the pressure door and as they walked in, the floor sloped steeply upward. 



“What?” Eastern said. “Why does it look like we're supposed to walk up a wall?”



Selkirk bent low and peered further down the hall, trying to see around the bend. “It’s for the gravity change. Come on.”



She led the three of them up the ramp, and as they walked, Nick could feel a slow orientation change. At the top, they were standing on the ‘wall’ of Hyacinth. If everything was transparent, he could look up and see the whole station. “Huh.” He said, when he realized what happened.



Hyacinth was long ago automated to the point where - as Nick found with the gravity - people are rarely if ever needed. They walked carefully with light steps, but it wasn’t necessary; there was nobody around. They exited out of a maintenance door into the shipping ring. They walked around looking for Selamine shipping, and after the third loop around found the very small office. It was little more than a service window with a screen connected. As they approached, Nick and Selkirk started to slow so that Eastern was in front by the time they reached the window. She glanced to the side and saw they had moved. “What? You’re really going to have me…” She shook her chest very slightly, “Shake my goods at them?”



“No, of course not.” Nick said, and Selkirk nodded behind. “Not if you don’t want to.” His eyes flicked down to her chest and back up. “They are very nice though, and Sunny did say-”



“I am not going to pander to some horndog AI to get us a ride!” Eastern said, but she was trying to hold back a smirk. “I’ll put on a show for you two all day long, but I don’t want to use my… assets to entice a stranger.”



“Okay Eastern, that’s fine.” Selkirk said and stepped forward. As she did, the tips of her ears brushed against Eastern’s chest very slightly.



“Don’t you start too,” She said. “I’m not in the mood.”



Sekirk’s tail swished across her waist as she approached the window, and pressed the call button. “Selamine Shipping, your spot for sending selected stuff safely!” The voice was male sounding and chipper. “How can I help you?”



“We’re looking to book passage off Hyacinth.” Selkirk said.



“Passenger lines are clockwise around the ring.” The voice said. “This is a goods shipping company only.”



“But you came highly recommended to us, we’d like to hire you.” Nick said, leaning in so he could be seen on the camera. “We’re not… interested in the regular passenger lines.”



“Sorry to hear that,” the voice continued. “Even if we wanted to haul you - which I never said we did - our ships are configured for cargo. If on the other hand, you have three thousand tonnes of wheat, we can talk.”



“Please.” Eastern said and leaned in so she could be seen as well. Nick and Sel looked over to her, but said nothing. “We are looking for Tinker Toy. Someone said that they would be willing to carry us.”



“Tink? You *want* to hire Tink? He does the Hyacinth/Ganymede/Strife run these days. He has as long as I’ve worked here.” There was a pause. “Why?”



“Because we-” Eastern started, and then Selkirk interrupted. 



“Because we’re interested in old AIs!” She said quickly. “My colleagues don’t want to tip their hand, but we’re interviewing AIs for an upcoming media program and we’re looking for people. We want to hire Tink and interview him while en route. We’ll pay for the privilege too. Tink will get some money, and you’ll get the shipping fees.”



“Hold on.” The voice said carefully. “I’ll ask.”



Some cheery hold music started playing on the screen and Nick turned to Sel. “We’re doing *what*?”



“I needed something to get their attention quick. Don’t worry; once we’re aboard and can talk to Tink directly, we can talk him into it.”



“I don’t know…” Nick started.



“Hey, if we can’t, Eastern can always Voice him.” Selkirk said shrugging.



*<She’s right. All you have to do is order people to do what you want>*

  


*<*I don’t want to do that> Eastern hissed in her mind. <It’s not right going around ordering people to do stuff with a voice that can’t be disobeyed. That’s…. That’s….>



*<That’s how you run an Empire.>*

  


Before they could argue further, the music cut out and a person appeared on the screen. Middle aged, male shaped, with a wry expression. “Believe it or not, Tink is interested. Says he’s looking for ‘something different’ and since it’s just the three of you, he says you can ride in the crew compartment. Payment up front to Tink and to us.”



“Right you are.” Selkirk said as she opened her pad. She flicked a file to the clerk’s image. “Payment in full, including a tip for yourself. We’re looking for a bit of discretion, you see?” Selkirk winked.



The clerk looked down at his own pad, and his eyes widened. “R-Right you are. N-Not a word from me.” He looked up and around as if he was looking for someone. “In fact, I don’t know who I am talking with right now, it must be some kind of glitch. I certainly won’t be telling anyone who can hear me to head to gate L348 to find Tink. Oh well.” And the screen went black.



“See?” Selkirk said “Easy.” 



“What did you give the clerk?” Nick asked.



“I gave him two things.” She held up two furred fingers. “One, I gave him enough money to run off and start his own shipping company, and two, I gave him an image of what happens to people who cross the Discoverers.”



Nick and Eastern stared at Sel.



“What? It’s not like I was *going* to have him picked up on fake charges and then kept in isolation for a month and steal his identity and commit crimes with it until Houndstooth was looking for him and dump him in Congregation square with a submachine gun and no sleep for forty hours.”



“Sel that’s… awfully specific.” Eastern said.



She crossed her arms. “Don’t fuck with the K’laxi on Hyacinth and you’ll have nothing to worry about then.”



Before they could make it to the stairs to head down to the umbilicals, there was this… tone. Three notes in an arpeggio. It simultaneously came from seemingly every speaker in Hyacinth. In all his years living here, he never heard anything like it. The voice that came on next *was* familiar. 



“Citizens of Hyacinth, this is Houndstooth President and CEO, Helen Raaden. Your help is needed to capture three dangerous fugitives. Nicholas North, Eastern Standard, and Selkirk Nemari. You are to find them and B̸͔̉r̵̯͆i̴̮͒ǹ̷̫g̴̼̑ ̴͔̈́ť̸͓h̷́ͅę̵͆m̴̤̈́ ̵̲͌t̷͙̀ǒ̶͙ ̷͚͒m̶̛̭e̴̪̐.”



The effect was immediate. Everyone on the shipping ring dropped what they were doing - sometimes literally - and began searching. Eastern looked on in horror as the customers at an all day cafe stood nearly as one and walked out. She looked down at Nick and Selkirk and… they were frightened as well? They weren’t affected?



*<They have more than enough of your Nanites to resist the Empress’ Voice.>*

  


*<*What? How does that work?> She thought.



*<Do you want us to explain it, or do you want to survive the next ten minutes? Go to the ship.>*

  


Eastern grabbed Nick and Sel’s arms and pulled them towards the stairs. She didn’t dare speak lest someone recognize her voice. She’s not sure how they would since she is pretty sure she doesn’t know anyone… down here…. As they turned a corner, ready to go down the stairs, a woman in a smart business suit and a short haircut turned and locked eyes with Eastern. “Eastern!” She called,  “You must go to the CEO!” And started towards them.

  
Eastern shrieked without realizing it, and pulled Nick and Selkirk harder.



They ran down the stairs two at a time, and reached the lower docking level. “Who was that Eastern?” Sel said as they continued to run.



“Old girlfriend, I didn’t know she worked around here.” Eastern said, distracted as she was counting the umbilicals. “L300, 325, here!” They were panting and out of breath as they ran to the dock. Eastern slammed the call button and nearly shouted ""Tinker Toy? It's Eastern, Selkirk, and Nick. We spoke with your shipping company about a charter?""



The speaker next to the umbilical crackled. “So… why did the president of Houndstooth get over the Hyacinth wide PA - did you know it had one of those? I didn’t - Anyway, why did she go over the PA and order your capture. She used a weird tone of voice at the end too.”



“Wait, you weren’t compelled to obey?” Nick said.



“No? Why would I be? She’s not Empress, Melody is long dead.”



“Yeah, about that,"" Eastern started, ""we can explain inside.” 



Selkirk said “Please let us in.”



Nick looked back towards the hall. There wasn’t anyone coming, yet. ""Yes please. It's somewhat urgent. Can we come aboard?""



The pressure door on the umbilical hissed open. “Well now I'm interested. Let's go.""



They ran down the airlock and when they were about halfway through, there was a pounding on the Hyacinth side and some shouting. “Oh hey, there’s a bunch of people here looking for you.” Tink said. “They seem really insistent too. None of them are CPTs or CSEs even.” He chuckled to himself. “It’s not like that’s going to work anyway, those are hardened.” As he said that there was a howl and squeal of a blade on metal. “Oooh, saws! That might work, but it’ll take them hours. Come on in.”



The three of them scrambled in to the ship, nearly tripping over the airlock. Eastern looked back towards the umbilical. The noise of the saws had changed tone and were sounding *much* more angry. “Tink! We need to go now now *n̶̦̗̄ò̷̬̩w̵͚̑.̴̞͋.*”



“Oh hey, your voice did the same thing that the president’s voice did on the announcement. How did you do that?”



The Voice wasn’t effecting Tinker Toy. Eastern realized it was just something else to ask the Nanites later when they were safe. “We’ll tell you all about it after we’re safe, okay? Can we please go?” Eastern said, as she picked up Sel and they made their way deeper inside. 



 “Ha! You don't have to tell me twice, I love a dramatic exit!"" The airlock door slammed shut and it was followed quickly by a muffled thump and shock. The three of them fell off balance as they switched from Hyacinth to local gravity all at once in the airlock. Eastern looked out the tiny window of the airlock door and saw debris and ice as Hyacinth fell away. Tinker Toy had used explosives to disconnect and was now actively thrusting away from Hyacinth.



“Thanks, Tinker Toy. My name is Eastern, this is Nick, and this is Selkirk. Nice to meet you.""



“Oh wow, I haven’t talked with a K’laxi in ages. You had better come on up."" and the door on the other end of the airlock room hissed open.



Eastern helped Selkirk back to her feet as Nick stood and they all  stepped inside. As they stepped inside, Eastern smelled something odd. She had read that lots of old AI operated ships tended to take on the appearance of their resident and their tastes. Some were small, cozy affairs, others had houseplants everywhere, some were decorated in styles centuries old. 



Tinker Toy was stacked with books. Real paper books. Everywhere.  Every surface was covered in books. Eastern didn't know a lot about paper books; they were easy to steal but always missed, so she never went after them. That said, she knew a bit about their value, and Tinker Toy had a literal fortune in literature on board.



The second thing she noticed was Tinker Toy was huge. Far, far larger than what they expected. Her type wasn't mentioned in the entry that Eastern found and the shipping company just mentioned that she hauled cargo.



""Tinker Toy, you're... larger than I expected. Are you...""



""A Starjumper? Yeah. I don't do that kind of stuff anymore, but that's why I'm so large. Works out for cargo though, I can haul lots to the OPA free cities. They like their privacy and if they can stretch resupply runs all the better for them.""



As they walked down the long hallway - also stacked with books - there was a thump. The three of them were knocked off balance, and a stack of books nearby collapsed. A moment later there was a muffled siren that was blocked further as Eastern heard doors slamming shut throughout the crew compartment. Immediately after, there was a whine that rose from the background noise of the ship, almost teeth rattlingly loud. Dusty red lights illuminated hand holds in the hallway. ""Uh, folks, please come up here *quicker*. I just WEPed the reactor and we gotta boogie; I need you strapped down. Hyacinth is firing on us.”



They all looked at each other and ran."

How To Rise Above Humanity,venting,1i8q0wc,2025-01-24 02:23:07,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1i8q0wc/how_to_rise_above_humanity/,Medical-Orchid-5034,,"Some postive venting. Forgive the terrible formatting. I am not an avid Reddit user.

If you close your eyes and imagine your world as perfect and ideal as possible, what does it look like? Really, try it. Do not be modest, literally morph anything you desire. Now when you open your eyes, are you currently living in that world? If not, are you working to make that world come true? For most of you, regardless of your answer, the truth is 'no'. I adhere to a philosphy, instilled in me by my dear friend. If something has been done before it is inherently possible. You, dear viewers,  the average person, might think 'I CAN'T have that luxury car!' for example. Yes. By literal definition, you can. You can steal one. It's yours. Done. You can work, live in a tent, eat cans of beans for 50 years. Don't test the logistics of that latter example but I'm sure you see my point.   
This philosphy does not account for morality or time. It does however destroy the very notion of limits, and removes the construct of impossbility. If someone somewhere has done something, you can do. However, you are conditioned to prioritize friends, surface level interactions, video games, weed. Or perhaps you don't see yourself as capable. You are too old, too shy, whatever. Perhaps you simply have moral reservations. Either way, literally anything is possible, it comes down to what WE as people are willing to do for it. I cannot fathom existing without going for our ideal worlds. Once we die that's it. Even if you fail, when you die it won't matter, you died trying your best. I was born into circumstances no better than average. I do not have a family to call my own, worked and survived on my own since 16 year sold, I've been homeless, encountered all sorts of abuse and various unsavory topics. These endeavors, even when endured to a lesser degree are often flaunted people.   
I have autism. I am ugly, can't get a girlfriend. And so on.  To exist with overwhelming confidence, I mean so selfishly that regardless of typical reason you go peruse anything you please is a world I implore you all to step into. I don't care what your goal is, as long as you do it. Want to live in Japan, have intercourse with young women there, and exist playing video games?  .... Well..I won't judge, there are avenues to do even that. I'm like Dr. Strange, I see all universes and in at least one any version of ourselves exist.    
I will not explain my upbringing but it was starting from zero. A dropout, no cash, a rugged loser. Allow me to explain my plan and goals.   
Starting Feburary I will enter basic training for the United States Coast Guard. Boot camp lasts for about 2 months. Afterwards I will wait 6 months as a non-rate. Essentially a choreboy, keeping watch or doing whatever is asked, perhaps shadowing my job or perhaps going out to sea. After this I will attend 2 months of yeoman school in Cali. By the end of this year I will have my duty station, and likely not move very often. A yeoman handles HR, travel, pay..office work. Closer to a steady 8 hours than what one might expect in the service. During my offtime I will take online classes. An Associate's Degree in Accounting via AMU using Tuition Assistance (TA). This will be at no cost to me. Food and housing will also be provided during my years of service. I can even collect extra income if I live below the housing allowance.  
  
Let's assume I save $1,500 per month. This does not account for taxes or any cash I do spend but also does not account for pay raises, potential deployment, etc. Just a general safe estimate. I will spend not a single cent unless required to live. 1,500/monthly, no expenses.. targeting \~$70,000 in savings by the end of my 4 year enlistment.  
   
During my final year I will research and secure a job for me to transition to right as I exit. Accounting and the like can net about $50k/yearly. I will also secure housing in Atlanta (Film capital of the US, close to home.)  using the VA loan for a duplex near SCAD. The VA loan negates the need for down payments on homes, essentially. Meaning I will only have to pay mortgage on say a $300k duplex. Which, I shall rent out, and use collections to live for nigh free. Another will pay my mortgage while I build equity.    
The GI bill, as most might know, covers schooling. I will attend SCAD, and peruse film--acting. I will make connections here, knowing people who know people. I will leverage my knowledge and degree to handle say, my peer's taxes, or budgets for student films. I'll charge by the hour and gain social & professional cred in both careers. I will also balance work during this time, no matter how stressful. The GI bill provides housing allowance, say $2k, which I will pocket. As I network with industry professionals to create opportunities for the next phase I will have multiple levels on income. This is where most people go into debt.    
After school, we are looking at well beyond six figures, liquid cash, home equity, minimal expenses and zero debt. I will be in my late twenties by now. I will be free to peruse anything I wish. I will spend the rest of my life chasing the craft--acting. EIther I make it or die enjoying my one true passion. No living in a box in LA, this works. It's surefire.    
Why do all of this? My 3 goals:   
To do paid acting work.   
To live in perceived luxury.   
To date and sleep with models (By profression.)   
I am hedonistic, I do not value anything or anyone but myself and my desires. I adore romance, refined, elegant living, jazz music, suits, fancy dinners. I will have my own place, decorate it all gaudy. Greek statues, lepord print, gold everything. A literal throne for my seat at an extended dinner table. I will naturally attract attractive creatives. Vet staus alone carries so much prestige. Hell, having abs is often enough. I will have my own place, cash, an extroverted personality. I'll be an actor, a creative logical, finance guy, who served the country and peruses performance. To drown in a sea of silk sheets and roses, to bathe in moonlight with the most attractive elites, I desire to live comically over-the-top while acting. And I will. I will be among this world's elite, building wealth, starring in films, and enjoying all of life's pleasantries. I  will take hot date stop CUT in Vegas, spend $3k on a meal, and have intercourse at a $5k/per night hotel because I can make it up with my strategy. I will live the exact life I'd want in an ideal world, starting from zero. And I will do so without company or validation. I will do so through a series of specific seemingly unrelated schemes. By using the system. I am not a smart man. I am a drop out. A snake, who will do anything for long term pleasure.    
And you’ll tell yourself I’m wrong. That this is just my perspective. That you’re fine. But you all could never, in a million years, truly comprehend what I’m saying—not because you’re dumb, not because I want to hurt you, but because the entire foundation of how you live is why you’re depressed. And rather than confront it, you bury it under escapism, under video games, under comfortable friendships with people who validate stagnation instead of challenging it. You surround yourself with others who also coast through life, wearing their identities, their struggles, their disabilities like armor, because it makes it easier to stay where they are rather than demand something greater of themselves. And maybe that feels safe. Maybe that feels comforting. But that comfort is exactly what is keeping you in place, suppressing real emotion, real ambition, real personal understanding.  
   
Yet I will rise beyond the world of average.    
I don’t need to convince anyone of any of this. I don’t need to argue it, and I don’t need to be “right” in this moment. Time will prove it for me. Because no matter where I am, no matter how I feel at any given moment, my life is on an upward trajectory. And one day, when you look at where I am compared to where you are, you will know—without me saying a single word—that this was never about opinion. This was never about winning or losing. It was about truth. You can take anything away from me and I'll be here. If you are nothing without people or things, least if all shallow things and people then youre nothing. The richest men, the kings of the world do not watch grindset videos. They do not work out and tell themselves they are ''sigma''. They do not vape and play Fortnite all day. They do not hide behind disabilities. They do not give up ambition for their wives or children. At 60+ some men are driving luxury cars and still acting to this day. You all, or your family that have reaches this age.. You guys can hardly walk. Don't you want to die as someone?   
I am above the average, I am crazy. I do not have what most have. My life has been and will be boring for year stop come, but as a result I'll get what I want at just the right time. It's not a goal, it's a truth. "
Rewatched Ashley’s Video Clip,ashleybarnesnark,1i8pq9r,2025-01-24 02:01:34,38,0.96,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ashleybarnesnark/comments/1i8pq9r/rewatched_ashleys_video_clip/,AgitatedJury920,,"****OVERALL: WE ALL KNOW THAT ASHLEY BARNES JUST VICTIMIZES HERSELF & PLAYS (or goes along with) THE WE ARE JUST KIDS/TEENS CARD EVEN THOUGH THEY’RE… OR AT LEAST SHE IS ABOUT TO BE 18 THIS YEAR. IT DOESN’T MATTER THAT IT’S 10 MONTHS AWAY. 17 SHOULD STILL HAVE A BRAIN TO KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG.****

****And just because I like how it sounded when I commented it somewhere else:****
- ****Ashley Barnes, the Miss mental health TikToker “advocate influencer”. this is literally the only place you’ll get that title, and it is sarcastic.**** 
- *And you only know how to trigger and or make people feel bad about themselves. you and your little salads 24/7 is not healthy or recovered from an ED.*

****don’t post your life if you don’t want people to comment on it.****
- *no one needs to know that you got a second round of salad or that you’re with Savannah, who quite frankly does not look happy in most of the photos recently you posted to your own Snapchat. How do you think that makes her feel about her insecurities?*

---

ashley didnt like the supposed sexual tone of conversation, and possibly ghosted Aly —if true, reasonably so. 

****BUT****
 why text her when your plane was delayed when you have not talked to her since? *doesn’t ashley have other friends?* ****OH WAIT**** it’s because she wanted to hang out with “the weird sexual girl” —— *(no hate to aly because i love her, just saying what ashley basically said)* —— that she stopped talking to, who lives in CA. ****——genuinely, what the fuck, if a person claims to be an influencer then you should have networked a bit.****

and there  is no secret that Aly knew about Ashley’s social media… *Given the fact that she literally messaged her on one of her social medias (?)*

Aly was excited about the increase in likes and follows on her page due to their public relationship, ****but she would be excited regardless.**** 

Ashley’s ‘friends’ (who appear more often on her social media than Aly ever did) say Aly is using Ashley? *… Some of Ashley’s friends wouldn’t have as many followers without their association with “influencer”Ashley Barnes.*

- and then Ashley would say: “no, she’s my girlfriend and she’s so pretty and she likes me”*— how about “no we genuinely like EACHOTHER and WE want to get to know each other…”, and then probably add on something about her personality that you know… since apparently got “very close” with during your nine hour delayed flight (which the conversation would’ve never happened if Ashley apparently never initiated it after ghosting her)*

Ashley’s “unnamed” ex, who is stereotypically pretty and a dancer, wants to join an agency and post? JUST LIKE she wanted to post with Ashley when they were internet best friends? but (*apparently*) Ashley didn't like filming with her. 

and going to the point of why Ashley didn’t talk to Aly “as much”. school work, valid. tiktok…., not so much. OH BUT that is her job. she HAS to post. right? … but its a problem that Aly wanted to film with you?

I guess to Ashley it is SOOOOOOOOO surprising that her girlfriend wanted to create her own TikToks instead of letting Ashley have all the attention from the TikToks they posted together. … Ashley was specifically noted that Ali wanted to monetize her content… um? It’s not like when you filmed TikTok when you first met that you gave her some of the money you earned. —*stop acting like this is a fucking attack of her trying to monetize you & your relationship when you just automatically had that anyway.* 

- The fact that Aly got an agency of her own doesn’t mean she met Ashley just for that. Aly went out of her way to *network with people.* All she did with Ashley from the beginning was say she’s pretty and ask for her snap. ****She didn’t ask for her hand in marriage.**** Saying someone’s pretty doesn’t mean you want to date them. *Maybe Aly had something about her sexuality in her profile bio,* ****and Ashley assumed.**** Ashley knew Aly likes girls.  ****honestly, this all screams ashley wanted a hookup or fwb.****

****SOMEONE REMIND ASHLEY: Aly didn’t lose followers from their breakup, where people sided with Ashley.****

- *who was the one to DELETE their videos?… ALY! Ashley kept them up because she can still get paid from it.*
---
in addition, the masc vs femme comment? … i dont know much about whether the difference of how to treat a person is different BUT still Ashley treated it like Aly was the (*like in hetero relationships*) guy who should buy the girl flowers. ****ALY POSTED ON TIKTOK THAT HER GF GAVE HER ROSES, & IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE RECEIVED FLOWERS ROMANTICALLY*** 
- all the same whether masc or femme to Ashley (but just the appearance of the person is different). Ashley just wants to be the gift recipient.
---
… and like she said towards doing stuff for Savannah: Ashley does stuff every day… she spends the money she earns on TikTok on trips to the mall and stupid little huge Crumbl cookies.  
- I feel bad for that girl Sav because it’s just like you should come back with the same thing and not do any extravagant “Will you be my valentine” stuff/etc.  HELL YOU SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER THAN HER FAMILY WHILE SHE HAD HER FAMILY MORE THAN YOU DO AT YOUR AGE. 

****ANYWAYS but between Aly and Sav, what changed? *OH* it’s Sav is local and not long distance. —DONT BE LONG DISTANCE IF YOU CANT HANDLE IT****

---
****what is clear is that Aly liked Ashley****
so of course aly would want to meet up.

Ashley practically ghosted Ali because supposedly she was being very sexual and Ashley did not like that. —THE BLOCK/UNADD BUTTON YOU ARE SOOO FAMILIAR WITH IS RIGHT THERE GIRL—

****BUT**** Ashley then says she reaches out to Ali when her plane to California got delayed nine hours (?) … she let time pass by until she had nothing and no one to talk to before she reached out to Aly. And like she said, nothing would’ve ever happened if she did not reach out to Aly. 
Ashley barely knew Aly at the time because Ashley used Aly during her delayed flight as a distraction —*probably her friends were busy*.  ****and we are BACK to the same point, why hang with someone you didn’t like?**** why SPEND THE WEEK with her? ****OH WAIT**** it’s because Aly is an actually nice person if you talked to her.

and yeah… people want to film tiktoks…ESPECIALLY if the people they hang with film tiktoks. … um- since Ashley had a “following” do i need to say again that ashley gets *PAID.*

i can’t get over the way she paused yet was SO QUICK to say it was her fault they didn’t talk after saying “they didnt talk much”.

and she mentions her friends can confirm this… but i have no doubt she told them to shut their mouths so she can drive the narrative.

****& LIKE IF ALY ENCOURAGED VERY HEAVILY FOR ASHLEY TO COME OUT:**** we don’t even know if Ashley put words in Aly‘s mouth for her. *how much was Ashley talking about the idea of coming out at her sweet 16* could it have been enough for aly to encourage her to do the public coming out at her birthday party. —— *or is this like (as Ashley wants to say) … the movie happiest season kinda situation???* 

And yeah Aly may not have had a following. BUT you canNOT tell me that people found and followed her after y’all met for the first time ****—IT WASNT ALL BECAUSE OF OPENLY DATING. … or god forbid people liked Aly and followed her just for her…. the fyp exists 😱****


- OH & MAYBE just maybe some people/family at her party didn’t know about her sexuality but she did say Milina accidentally outed her before or after this (on TikTok live). and we all know Ashley can never shut her mouth so she most likely talked about that situation. —it was the matter of the internet knowing, mostly i would say"
Zheng Yi Sao. Queen of the Pirates (1775-1844),VillainyGroup,1i8oh2q,2025-01-24 00:37:49,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VillainyGroup/comments/1i8oh2q/zheng_yi_sao_queen_of_the_pirates_17751844/,Psygnal,,">Zheng Yi Sao (also known as Ching Shih) was a Chinese pirate leader who was active in the South China Sea in the early years of the 1800s.

[Zheng Yi Sao](https://preview.redd.it/hexnovqipvee1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=974b41b9a4b9edbeeb306e289ef540ff053f4c97)

At the height of her power, Ching Shih commanded over 400 sailing vessels and around 50,000 pirates, all part of the Guangdong Pirate Confederation.

Her ships would prey upon the trading vessels of many major powers, such as the East India Company, the Portuguese Empire, and the Qing Dynasty, out of China.

**TAKING POWER**

She didn't start out as the leader of the confederation. Growing up poor in Guangdong province, she worked at one point as a prostitute in a floating brothel.

At the age of 26, Ching Shih met and married Zheng Yi, who was the former leader of the pirates. He and his adopted son Zhang Bao basically ruled the waves around quite a large part of the South China Sea in the tail-end of the 1700s, and start of the 1800s.

It was when Zheng Yi up and died that things got a bit hairy. Had the leadership gone to someone else within the faction, Ching Shih would probably have been killed.

As it stands, however, she married her former husband's adopted son to consolidate her position, and then took the reigns of power herself.

Her rule was brutal.

Any pirate who took too much initiative without following orders, or who flouted orders, or did basically anything that wasn't on the ""approved things to do"" list was immediately beheaded.

It was a brave pirate indeed who did anything other than precisely what he was told, when he was told to do it, and the fear and awe she commanded was instrumental in retaining her position.

That, and the fact that she was actually very good at being a pirate.

**THE PEARL RIVER RAIDS**

The pirate confederation really stepped up its game after Ching Shih rose to power... culminating in the destruction of a good half of the Chinese provincial fleet, and allowing the pirates access to the Pearl River network, and the rich - much plunderable - lands therein.

Numerous villages, settlements, and towns fell victim to the rampaging pirates. Ching Shih and her lieutenants oversaw the slaughter of many thousands of people.

It also saw a surge in recruiting, and the acquisition of quite a few more ships. The pirate confederation was going from strength to strength, and things were looking decidedly grim for the provincial forces.

**THE FINAL BATTLE**

The last grand battle was the blockade of Tung Chung Bay, where a combined fleet of Chinese and Portuguese forces attacked the pirates as they anchored for repairs.

The battle waxed and waned, but ultimately turned into a blockade, as the combined forces of China and Portugal stopped the pirates from fleeing into open water, or cruising back into the Pearl River where they would have the advantage of smaller vessels.

Worried that the blockade was turning into a stalemate, the leader of the combined forces launched fireships against the pirate fleet.

Of the forty-three fireships that were launched against the pirates, not a single one found a target. Several were actually turned around as the wind shifted, and set fire to two of the Sino-Portuguese fleet.

The pirates broke the blockade with the favourable wind, and easily slipped past their foes. The final tally of damage was around 46 ships (including the fireships), to none. The pirates were largely unscathed.

**THE ODDS WERE SHIFTING**

Trade with China was too lucrative to allow a bunch of rowdy pirates to control the oceans, so eventually the British, Chinese, and Portuguese forces all joined forces to tackle the pirate threat.

While Ching Shih was a capable commander, the combined naval might of several of the world's first super-powers was all but insurmountable, regardless of the loyalty she commanded.

The pirate supply lines were ultimately cut off, and Ching Shih - aware of the changing tides - decided to get out while she still had some power to negotiate.

Timed well, but not without the occasional hiccup, negotiations for a cease-fire and ultimate surrender were underway... and 17,318 pirates, 226 ships, 1,315 cannons, and 2,798 assorted weapons were surrendered in April 1810. Ching Shih later sailed in with her personal retinue of 24 ships and 1,433 pirates and surrendered those as well.

**POST SURRENDER, AND OUTCOMES**

Ching Shih and her husband actually did quite well for themselves after giving up piracy.

Zhang Bao - the husband - joined forces with the Provincial Chinese fleet and started mopping up those pirates and ships which had not surrendered. He advanced in rank in the fleet to colonel before succumbing to illness and dying in 1822.

>In 1844, Zheng Yi Sao died, having become the proprietor of an infamous gambling house somewhere around Guangdong, where she had grown up."

He recognized her, she was the storyboard artist for Adventure Time.

""Well, hello Steven. What brings you here?"" she asked him.

""Oh,"" he said. ""I was watching my friends film for their show, and now, I'm heading home,"" he said.

""Alright."" She looked around and then noticed something familiar about him. ""Hey, by any chance are you-"" she took out her phone and went on YouTube and looked up a video titled 'My Son Singing' She then continued her sentence. ""-This boy with the ukelele?"" Rebecca showed him the YouTube video to him.

Steven smiles and remembers that day well. But, it fades fast as he asks his next question ""Yes… But am I in trouble?"" the woman chuckles and then shakes her head.

""Not at all Steven. I'm just saying that you have a lot of potential.

*potential? potential for what?*

""Uhhh, for what?"" Steven asked.

""Come into my office, we can talk there,"" Rebecca said walking over to the large Cartoon Network building in the middle of the studio.

Then, Mordecai and Rigby walked up. ""Hey, Quartz. We're going to the arcade with Muscle Man, you in?"" Rigby asked the boy.

""Maybe later guys. Rebecca's taking me to her office."" both Mordecai and Rigby felt a chill go up both their spines.

""What'd you do?""

Rebecca chuckles. ""Steven Isn't in trouble guys, we are going into my office for a little bit."" The Blue Jay and Raccoon both nod and watch their friend go with her.

Rebecca walked to an elevator and went into her office Steven saw it, her desk was cluttered. it had an open laptop on it, and some scripts for the show were next to her computer.

""Alright, Steven."" She took a seat at her desk and scooted her chair. Steven sat on the chair that was across her desk, Steven sat there nervously playing with his hands. He has never done this before.

Rebecca smiles. Steven felt more at ease, but not all the way relaxed. ""I can see that you are nervous. Let me tell you, there is nothing to be nervous about, okay? I'm human, not a robot."" Steven chuckles nervously and puts his hands on his lap.

Rebecca opened a drawer and pulled something out it was a colorful sphere.

""Have you heard of these? They're called Hoberman spheres."" She explained. Steven nods. ""I've played with these in school before,"" he said, before grabbing it and opening and closing it.

""I watched your video before and I loved your singing and your skills on that ukulele,"" she said. Steven nods.

""Do you want to call my parents, they can come here, I'm free today. Or tomorrow will be best.""

""Um…. I'm going to have to call them."" He said pulling out his phone and calling his mom.

*""Yes, Steven?""*

""Hey, Mom. Could you and Dad maybe come to the Cartoon Network lot?""

*""Alright, may I ask why though?""* Rose asked her son.

""I'm with Rebecca Sugar. She is the one who did the storyboard for Adventure Time, And, She's wondering if you and Dad could come and talk, I don't know about what. But…"" Steven looks at Rebecca.

""Let me talk to her,"" she said, Steven nodded and handed the phone over to her.

""Hello, Rose, I am Rebecca Shugar I'm here with your son can you come with your husband to the Cartoon Network studio lot, I want to talk about some stuff with you guys.""

*""Alright, we will come,""* Rose said, hanging up.

…

A few minutes pass, Greg and Rose arrive at the Cartoon Network movie lot. They got access and they parked at the building, they walked inside.

""Hello."" An employee said.

""Hi, we're here to see Rebecca Sugar, our son is with her.""

""Alright, she's in her office. Seventh floor, Room seven twenty-eight.""

Greg and Rose nodded and they went up the elevator. They walk down a hallway filled with many closed doors. Some were open, Greg stopped and read a black plaque that was next to the door that said: 'Cartoon Network Studios, Rebecca Sugar'

Rose knocks on the door. ""Come in!"" She said. Greg and Rose both enter the room and see Steven. ""Please have a seat."" She said. Both of them sat down Steven still played with the toy that Rebecca gave him.

""I want to do a show that involves your son, I want to be a director, and I think that Steven will be perfect for the role of the main protagonist, and you two could be in it too.""

""Sounds, great!"" Greg said.

""Alright-"" She said, pulling out a small video camera from her desk, flipping the mini screen to the side, and then turning it on. ""-Say your names and ages for the camera please.""

All of them complied with her request. The last one to go up was Steven. ""I'm Steven Quartz Universe, I am eleven years old.""

Rebecca turned off the camera, put it to the side, and grabbed three sheets of paper, Rose looked at her. ""Alright, I want all of you to read these lines for me,"" she said, handing them all the sheets of paper.

Greg and Steven nods. ""You can go first,"" Greg told his wife.

""Okay."" she read the lines, Greg went next, and lastly, Steven. Steven then read the lines that were on the single sheet of paper.

Rebecca let them go, she is going to call them. She will make a show about Steven, but it is going to take a year to develop. But, for now. Steven Greg and Rose are going to go back home for now.

""Mom, Dad? can Clarence, Jeff and Sumo sleepover?""

""Well…"" Greg said. ""You do go to the same school. And your mother can drive you and them to school. Alright.""

Steven texted them and asked them. They all said yes and they got the sleepover set up.

""So, when are you doing the show?"" Sumo asked, They were all riding their bikes to the treehouse, and Steven told his parents that they would be back later in the day.

""Next year, I don't know what month though,"" he told his friends.

""That's cool, man!"" Sumo said.

""Heck yeah, it is!""

…

Clarence, Jeff, Sumo, and Steven were all at his house in his room, they were all playing GameCube, they were in their PJs, Greg had made dinner not so long ago, and now Steven was playing Mario Kart Double Dash. both boys watched Clarence and Jeff play, the hybrid was about to nod off on the opposite side of his bed, and Sumo was sitting cross-legged on the floor watching them. Steven fell asleep in minutes as Clarence and Jeff played.

""Hey, Clarence,"" Sumo said tapping him on the shoulder. The boy looks at him.

""Steven is asleep.""

""Okay?""

""Wanna pull a prank on him?"" Sumo asked. Clarence laughed as he paused. Jeff looked at them in annoyance. ""What are you guys doing?""

""Were pulling a prank on Steven, wanna help?"" Sumo asked.

""I am not getting involved with this,"" Jeff said, sighing. Clarence and Sumo had an idea, then smirked.

*Oh no, this can't be good.*

Greg and Rose were asleep, Clarence and Sumo both opened the door silently to their room. Sumo was looking around the room. Clarence tapped him on the shoulder. he looked at his friend and saw his mother's sword hung above their bed.

Sumo took it and walked out the door.

""Let's prank him.""

Clarence and Sumo both ran back in screaming, Steven woke up with a Shrek and he saw his friend carrying his mother's sword ""OH MY GOSH, OH MY—!"" Steven ran out, Sumo chased him around with it. Jeff glares at Clarence, Clarence puts his arms in defense. Both Clarence and Jeff raced downstairs, both boys saw Steven go to the pool and jump in, Sumo was laughing, and Steven popped out and shook his head. Letting all the excess water fall from his hair. ""WHAT THE FRICK GUYS?"" Steven asked.

Clarence giggled, holding his phone. He got that on video. ""Your parents didn't hear that?"" Jeff asked.

""Their deep sleepers, WHAT THE HECK SUMO?"" Sumo laughed, he grabbed him by the shirt and tossed him in the pool with him. The boys had a fun sleepover that night."
Advantages and disadvantages of investing in bonds,CapitalistExploits,1i8jwpf,2025-01-23 20:30:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i8jwpf/advantages_and_disadvantages_of_investing_in_bonds/,kayakero,,"# Definition of bonds

**Bonds are fixed-income instruments that represent a form of investment where investors lend money to an issuer**, whether a government, company, or local government entity, in exchange for receiving periodic interest and repayment of the invested principal on a predetermined maturity date. These securities are essential in the financial market for several key reasons:

* **Financing for issuers**: Bonds provide an important source of financing for governments and businesses. Issuers use the funds raised through bond issuance to fund projects, operations, and other financial needs. This is crucial for the functioning and growth of the economy.
* **Investment diversification**: Bonds offer investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios. By adding bonds to a portfolio that may include stocks or other assets, investors can balance risk and return, which is especially valuable during times of market volatility.
* **Stability and security**: Bonds are considered safer and more stable investments compared to stocks and other equity assets. This makes them an attractive option for those looking to preserve their capital and earn regular income.
* **Reference for interest rates**: Bond prices and interest rates are inversely related. When interest rates decrease, bond prices tend to rise, and vice versa. Therefore, bonds serve as an important reference for monetary policy and interest rate decisions in an economy.
* **Liquidity and secondary market**: Bonds are traded in the capital market, allowing investors to buy and sell bonds at any time before their maturity. This provides a source of liquidity and flexibility to investors who wish to adjust their portfolios according to changing market conditions.

In the United States, bonds play a crucial role in the financial market, with both the federal government and state governments and private companies issuing bonds as a form of financing. U.S. Treasury bonds, in particular, are highly valued globally due to the strength of the U.S. economy and its track record of meeting financial obligations.

These bonds, known as “[Treasuries](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us),” offer different maturities, such as 10-year and long-term bonds, and are often considered one of the safest investments in the world. Investors can also access corporate bonds issued by large companies looking to finance their operations or projects. In addition, there is a very active secondary market in the United States, allowing investors to sell or buy bonds with relative ease before their maturity, providing liquidity and adaptability to their portfolios.

# Advantages of investing in bonds:

When it comes to investing, knowing the advantages of investing in bonds is essential. Find out why they offer stability and regular income streams.

1. **Stable Income**: One of the main advantages of bonds is that they provide stable, predictable income. When you buy bonds, the issuer promises to pay you interest at regular intervals, usually semi-annually or annually. These payments can be a reliable source of income, which is especially beneficial for investors looking for consistent income to fund daily expenses, retirement, or other short-term financial goals.
2. **Capital Preservation**: Bonds, particularly those issued by strong governments or companies with excellent credit reputations, are considered safe investments. This means that you have a high probability of recovering your initial investment when the bond reaches its maturity date. Capital preservation is essential for those investors who want to minimize risk and protect their assets.
3. **Portfolio diversification**: Bonds offer an effective opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio. If your portfolio is primarily comprised of stocks or other equity assets, bonds can act as an important counterbalance. In times of stock market volatility, bonds tend to hold their value more stably, which can help smooth out overall fluctuations in your portfolio and reduce overall risk.
4. **Tax Advantages**: In some situations, bonds may offer tax advantages. For example, the interest on certain **municipal bonds** may be exempt from federal and state taxes, which can increase your after-tax yield. This makes bonds attractive to investors looking for tax efficiency and the ability to keep more of their earnings.

# Advantages of bonds in the United States

Investing in bonds in the United States offers several advantages, especially in terms of security, liquidity and stability. One of the main advantages is the security they provide, as Treasury bonds are backed by the “full credit” of the US government. This means that historically, the risk of default has been practically zero, making these bonds one of the safest options for conservative or near-retirement investors.

Another significant advantage is the liquidity of the Treasury bond market. This is the largest and most liquid government securities market in the world, allowing investors to buy and sell bonds with ease, without significantly affecting their price. As for yields, for example, 10-year bonds in 2024 offer a yield of around [3.79%](https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/bond-historical-data/united-states/10-years/), which remains attractive for those looking for a stable long-term investment.

Additionally, US Treasury bonds offer tax benefits, as the interest earned is exempt from state and local taxes, which is particularly advantageous for investors living in states with high income taxes.

# Disadvantages of investing in bonds :

In the world of investing, the disadvantages of investing in bonds also play a crucial role. We will explore the challenges and risks that investors should carefully consider.

1. **Lower returns**: One of the most notable disadvantages of bonds is that they generally offer lower returns compared to other, higher-risk investments, such as stocks. While they provide stability, you could miss out on higher profit opportunities that you could earn in the stock market. This difference in returns can be especially significant over the long term.
2. **Vulnerability to inflation**: Bonds can be vulnerable to inflation. Because interest payments are fixed at the time of issuance and not adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of those payments can decrease over time as prices rise. This means that in real terms, the value of your investment could decline over time, which is known as inflation risk.
3. **Interest Rate Risk**: Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise after you have purchased a fixed-rate bond, the price of the bond in the secondary market may decline. This could result in losses if you decide to sell the bond before maturity. Long-term bonds are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates.
4. **Lack of liquidity**: Some bonds, such as long-term treasury bills and less liquid corporate bonds, can be difficult to sell before their maturity date. This can limit your flexibility to access your money in case of urgent need or if you want to adjust your portfolio quickly in response to changes in market conditions.

# Disadvantages of bonds in the United States

While bonds in the United States offer safety and stability, they also have certain disadvantages that investors should be aware of. One of the main disadvantages is their relatively low yield compared to other investments. Historically, Treasury bonds have offered low yields, especially during periods of low interest rates, as seen in 2020 when the 10-year bond yield fell below 1%. While yields have risen, standing at around 3.79% in 2024, they remain less attractive to investors seeking higher returns.

**Inflation risk** is another significant disadvantage. Since bond payments are fixed, inflation can erode the purchasing power of these payments over time, reducing the real value of the investment. This is particularly relevant during times of high inflation, when rising prices outstrip the interest received, negatively affecting the bonds’ real yield.

Additionally, bonds are subject to interest rate risk, meaning that when interest rates rise, the value of previously issued bonds declines in the secondary market. If an investor needs to sell a bond before maturity, they could suffer a capital loss due to this effect. In 2022, for example, long-term Treasury bonds lost value when interest rates rose rapidly to combat inflation.

Finally, while Treasury bonds are highly liquid, other types of bonds, such as corporate or municipal bonds, can have liquidity issues, making it difficult to sell them before maturity without incurring significant losses.

# Alternatives to bond investing: the stock market

The stock market, also known as the equity market [**,**](https://theinvestoru.com/blog/ventajas-de-la-inversion-activa/) offers a significant alternative to bond investing. Below, we'll explore some of the key differences between investing in bonds and participating in the stock market:

1. **Higher return potential**: Unlike bonds, which typically offer lower, fixed returns, the stock market offers greater profit potential. Company shares can appreciate significantly over time, allowing investors to make considerable profits.
2. **Higher risk of volatility**: Although the stock market can provide higher returns, it is also more volatile and subject to daily fluctuations. Stock investors may experience substantial losses during periods of market decline.
3. **Diversification**: As with bonds, it is important to diversify your portfolio in the stock market. Buying a variety of stocks from different sectors and geographic regions can help reduce the risk of significant losses.
4. **Time horizon**: Your time horizon and financial goals play a crucial role in choosing between bonds and stocks. Bonds may be suitable for short-term goals or for investors seeking stability and capital preservation, while stocks are typically better suited for long-term goals, such as retirement.
5. **Dividend-based yield**: Some stocks pay dividends to investors, which can provide regular income similar to bond interest payments. However, stock dividends can vary and are not guaranteed, unlike bond interest payments.
6. **Combining strategies**: Many investors choose to combine bond and stock investment strategies to take advantage of both the stability of bonds and the growth potential of stocks. This combination can help balance risk and reward in a portfolio.

# Alternatives to bonds in the US market

In addition to the stock market, there are several attractive alternatives for those looking to diversify their investments outside of US bonds. Below, we explore some of the main options:

1. **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**: REITs are a way to invest in real estate without needing to physically own properties. These investments allow investors to earn income through rents generated by commercial, residential, or industrial properties. Additionally, REITs have the benefit of being required to distribute at least 90% of their income to investors in the form of dividends, which can offer a higher return than bonds, especially during periods of inflation.
2. **Preferred stock**: Preferred stock combines features of bonds and common stock. It offers regular dividend payments and takes priority over common stock in the event of a company's liquidation. Although it does not provide voting rights, preferred stock tends to be safer than common stock and provides a higher potential return than traditional bonds.
3. **High-yield savings accounts**: While savings accounts typically don’t outperform inflation, some high-yield options offer competitive interest rates, between 4% and 5%, making them a safe and liquid alternative for parking funds in the short term. These accounts can be useful for maintaining an emergency fund while earning a reasonable return.
4. **Real estate debt investment funds**: Investing in real estate debt, as platforms such as Groundfloor do, allows investors to finance short-term real estate projects and earn attractive returns, averaging approximately 10.5% per year. Although they carry more risk than traditional bonds, these types of investments can be a lucrative alternative in times of inflation​ (
5. **Fixed Annuities**: Fixed annuities guarantee regular payments to investors, making them an attractive option for those seeking stable income, especially in retirement. Although they have higher fees than bonds and some financial products, they offer security and a steady source of income.

These alternatives can offer higher returns than bonds, but it is also important to consider the higher risk they may entail, depending on market conditions and the type of investment.

$TRUMP Memecoin could fall 80% and reach $10,CapitalistExploits,1i8bqy9,2025-01-23 14:30:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i8bqy9/trump_memecoin_could_fall_80_and_reach_10/,kayakero,,"The TRUMP token experienced a sharp drop this Tuesday (21). It is not the new US president who is concerned, but the memecoin launched by him on Monday (20). With a 20% drop in the last 24 hours, TRUMP has practically wiped out much of the day's gains while big investors continue to capitalize on their profits.

At least 10 groups have made profits of over $20 million on the memecoin, with many seeing returns of over 8,000%. With this massive token sale, analysts are already expecting the price of TRUMP to fall and hit $10 in the coming days.

https://preview.redd.it/g4qevcrk6jee1.png?width=2512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cdb972fbba20a0d83f7dbe25bf0c38ae7df22ef

# Whales record profits and TRUMP falls

There are signs that top TRUMP traders, who posted the biggest gains, have started selling their tokens. David Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, made $1 million by buying the hot coin and then selling it.

On-chain data shows that the most profitable TRUMP trader made $59 million and has already withdrawn $44 million. Meanwhile, the trader who made the highest percentage return gained 8,200%, representing a profit of $34.6 million, by selling approximately $27.7 million.

Another trader made $53 million and sold everything, making a 91% return on the trade. The top 15 TRUMP holders have dumped millions of dollars worth of tokens.

This scenario is common in the stock and cryptocurrency markets, where large investors buy assets when their price is on the rise. They then sell them at the first opportunity, leaving small investors at a loss when the token price falls.

In addition to Trump, US First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin just hours after her husband. The price of the MELANIA token rose rapidly upon its launch, but has registered a 41% drop on Tuesday.

https://preview.redd.it/eq410nqm6jee1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=b63439fb54e3367524e627d49938ab6ea088534d

# Could TRUMP Price Drop to $10?

According to the 30-minute chart of TRUMP price, the memecoin reached a high of $75, where it formed a double top chart pattern with a retracement at $53. This pattern, with identical peaks, usually indicates that the asset will undergo a strong correction.

Next, the TRUMP price formed a small ascending wedge chart pattern, another negative sign in technical analysis. The wedge formed after the asset price fell sharply, indicating that it could be forming a bearish flag pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/btafyv4o6jee1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d3d8755dfddbe14d02ee863c2923f8c92c6dcd

Therefore, there is a risk that the sell-off could continue in the short term as investors await cryptocurrency policy announcements. A bearish breakdown could see the price drop to the next key support level at $21.45, its lowest level since January 18. If the price of TRUMP falls below this support level, it could reach $10.

The severe trauma team is a double edged sword for the university hospital. This is because as the severe trauma team saves more patients, the hospital goes further in in the red financially. Besides Baek Kang-Hyuk, the severe trauma team consists of Yang Jae-Won, Nurse Cheon Jang-Mi and anesthesiologist resident Park Kyung-Won. Yang Jae-Won belonged to the proctological surgery department that is led by Professor Han Yoo-Rim, but Yang Jae-Won was scouted by Baek Kang-Hyuk and joined his team. Yang Jae-Won becomes Baek Kang-Hyuk’s first pupil. Baek Kang-Hyuk turns the severe trauma team from a nominal existence to a team that actually goes out into the field and saves lives.

American Airlines shares tumble as outlook falls short,investinq,1i851mb,2025-01-23 09:51:10,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investinq/comments/1i851mb/american_airlines_shares_tumble_as_outlook_falls/,Equivalent_Baker_773,,"American Airlines shares fell more than 7% in early trading after the company issued a weaker-than-expected earnings outlook for the first quarter of 2025. The airline forecast an adjusted loss of 20 to 40 cents per share, significantly wider than analysts’ expectations of a 4-cent loss. American attributed the disappointing outlook to rising costs driven by lower capacity, a higher reliance on regional jets, and recently finalized labor agreements. In contrast, competitors like Delta and United offered more optimistic forecasts earlier this month.

Despite the challenges, American Airlines reported strong fourth-quarter results, with earnings per share of 86 cents adjusted, surpassing the expected 64 cents. Revenue rose to $13.66 billion, up 4.6% year-over-year, led by domestic and international growth, particularly a surge in trans-Pacific routes. Net profit increased to $590 million compared to just $19 million in the same quarter last year. The airline also reported a 17% increase in compensation from co-branded credit card deals with Citi and Barclays, contributing $6.1 billion in 2024.

CEO Robert Isom emphasized that American is positioned well for the future due to its network, loyalty programs, and operational reliability, despite past missteps. Last year, the company abandoned a failed business travel sales strategy that cost $1.5 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, American expects revenue to rise 3%-5% in the first quarter and up to 7.5% for the full year, with full-year earnings projected between $1.70 and $2.70 per share, aligning with analysts’ estimates.

American Airlines shares tumble as outlook falls short,stocks,1i82iee,2025-01-23 07:43:50,140,0.95,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i82iee/american_airlines_shares_tumble_as_outlook_falls/,Puginator,,"American Airlines’ first-quarter earnings outlook on Thursday fell short of analysts’ estimates, sending shares down roughly 10%.

The carrier forecast an adjusted loss per share of 20 cents to 40 cents for the first three months of 2025 based on current demand trends and fuel-price forecast, a wider loss than the 4 cents analysts were expecting, according to LSEG.

The airline said it expects unit costs, excluding fuel, to rise in the low-single digit percentage points over the first quarter of 2024 driven by lower capacity, which it expects to fall as much as 2% over last year; a higher mix of smaller, regional-jet flying; and new labor agreements it finalized last year.

The earnings outlook contrasts with sunnier forecasts from rivals United and Delta earlier this month, though American’s full-year earnings forecast of between $1.70 and $2.70, with analysts’ estimates.

American has spent much of the last year reversing a business-travel sales strategy that backfired last year. However, it also sealed a new credit card deal with its partner Citi. Compensation from its existing deals with Citi and Barclays rose 17% from 2023 to $6.1 billion last year, American said.

“As we look ahead to this year, American remains well-positioned because of the strength of our network, loyalty and co-branded credit card programs, fleet and operational reliability, and the tremendous work of our team,” CEO Robert Isom said in a news release.

Here is how American performed in the fourth quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 86 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents

Revenue: $13.66 billion vs. $13.40 billion expected

American’s fourth-quarter profit rose to $590 million from $19 million on sales that were up 4.6% on the year to $13.66 billion. Both domestic and international revenue rose, led by a surge in trans-Pacific revenue.

Homo Entari,u_eustachebedier,1i82614,2025-01-23 07:24:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_eustachebedier/comments/1i82614/homo_entari/,eustachebedier,,"Homo Entari live on Mars, and have done so since their ancestors departed Earth and landed on their new world, in the 26th century, contingents of humans spreading to all four corners of the globe. Their master is the Elected One, powerful recipient of utmost ascendancy over other countries of Mars, from his base, in the Great Main. The Great Main is and remains, for all Martians, the most powerful country on Mars, evolving from its primitive origins in the aftermath of the Spread, into a country containing twenty-five City-States and two grand Provinces. Homo Entari dominates this vast expanse, as it does the two other minor countries in which it has thrived, the Great Region of Cinta and the Migrational Kingdom of Junica. Cinta and Junica possess seventy million and forty million inhabitants respectively, which they have constrained to living in four cities and five cities respectively, with their own language, although these three countries are all inhabited by Homo Entari.

Homo Entaris possess deep glowing orange skin, wide hips, thin waists, pectorals of wide proportions, long feet and freckles scintillating in grey melanin. They take their appearance from an operation of genetic engineering occurring in Avanum, five thousand years earlier, taking place to ensure Homo Entaris would grow particular features to replace Homo Sapiens. A single Homo Sapiens was modified. His descendants would spread to the nearby towns of Kaltan and Subo, where they would first rival with Homo Sapiens, before deliberately and permanently replacing their Homo Sapiens neighbours. This long period has fascinated generations of historians alike in the following centuries, wishing to understand how Homo Entari came about, and trace with exactitude the spread of Homo Entari across cities. 

Homo Entaris are therefore spread across the surface of Mars in so-called City-States, thirty-four along the terrain of the planet, which rise like glittering, shining towers of dust in the Martian wilderness, created across four main periods of construction, lasting from the arrival of great contingents of Homo Sapiens on Mars, in 2501, to the late 3000 when Terraforming rose to render nature green and proliferating. These City-States are divided between the great City-States of the Great Main, those of Cinta and those of Junica, which form the largest body of cities across the Solar System, rivalling the great capitals of Nemter, Pabandil, Thanguan, Boswa and Chaimizin. In the Great Main, the cities are Avanum, Anphal, Edewen, Gor-Tula, Dewison, Anwodin, Juno, Narsu, Ilimia, Xuin, Sezwen, Ilewolon, Binjib, Subo, Nepheth, Batraan, Walarin, Kaltan, Mowib, Imphis, Tanosin, Awonto, Iba, Wadama and Batuxin. The great cities of Cinta are Zedron, Onotoji, Monsul and Wuoda, while in Junica they are Iollotep, Ichipic, Caumac, Tilitic and Maiendas. 

Homo Entaris have a long history spread across three Ages: the Age of Aethera, the Age of Abrus and the Age of Orean. Their history truly starts at the seminal, foreboding event of the Spread, highlighting human courage at the height of its plight as contingents left the Earth, spread across the Solar System (hence the name), and utilised genetic engineering to evolve into six new species. Following the Spread Homo Entari was genetically created in the city of Avanum in the former Lunae Planum region. In the beginning, Homo Entaris displaced local Homo Sapiens living on Mars since early, ancient times, then grew hand in hand with Terraforming, its spread leading to a new form of human being capable of breathing on Mars, before continuing with the rise of major cities across the surface, and the creation of these three great nations mentioned above, Junica (2900), Cinta (3100) and Great Main (3300). Homo Entari had invested most of the planet, continued changing it with the Second Age of Terraforming, in particular in the cities of Avanum, Anphal and Batraan, and solidified its genetic domination of Mars. Menacing winds from rival species carefully building up their fleets across space, in particular in the great area for resources in the Asteroid Belt, led to rivalry, and close contact. This culminated into the creation of the Homo Entari space force multiplying to encounter all acts of encroachment in the near orbit of Mars, working to build alliances across the Asteroid Belt with other species groups, and securing Homo Entari interests in the Solar System. Homo Entaris now control, from their base on Mars, networks of partnerships traversing the Solar System, with as its core the alliance with the Homo Samari human species of Kani-Veluna, bearers of an age-old alliance going back to the times of Siwunja (former Elected One, meaning ‘leader’, of Mars), establishing a long-lasting partnership with this human species of the Asteroid Belt, to counter the influence of the Crasitids (ruling class of the Homo Ijimi of Jupiter). Homo Entari now possess a network extending from Kani-Veluna to Titan, and they benefit as much from an alliance with the Tacuep (leader of Junica) as with the Enzungiz (leader of Homo Denawi). This is, in a nutshell, the history of Homo Entari.

The language Homo Entari master is called Protoin, constructed using a mix of Earth languages, of which the highest representatives are Mandarin and Arabic, evolved over time into a highly developed language spoken in the cities of the Great Main (the two minor countries of Homo Entari, Cinta and Junica, speak Avai and Juni respectively). Protoin was invented across three centuries, during which masters of languages led the invention of particular phrases constructed around such small phonemes as ‘wi’, ‘xi’, ‘wa’, ‘wo’ and ‘shu’, with close phonetic origin from the mentioned Mandarin and Arabic. Protoin underwent a gradual spread to the cities of Avanum, Subo, Batraan and Kaltan, before reaching further cities such as Ilimia, Narsu, Juno and Dewison. The language was thereafter used as the language of communication on Mars, while Avai and Juni proliferated in the regions of Cinta and Junica. Major literature employing the language of Protoin includes constructed prose recounting the epic arrival of Homo Sapiens in 2500, in the Book of Florus, the Eleven Passages of Time, and Edra, epic account of the first two ages of Mars, translated into Protoin. Protoin has been employed within the Lordship-Dominion of Mars, name given to the highest echelons of power within Homo Entari leadership, as the language of bureaucracy designed to envelop the entirety of Mars, and disseminate Homo Entari interests elsewhere in the Solar System. 

Homo Entaris are particularly fond of their space force, which they sometimes call the Ark, in the way it controls vast swathes of space across the Solar System, and its collection of larger and smaller allies, from Kani-Veluna all the way to Saturn. Homo Entaris possess immense amounts of territory, with at the apex of prestige and power, a single person: the Elected One, who holds immeasurable influence through his or her control of the Lordship-Dominion, governmental organ of Mars. The grandest alliance of Homo Entari, as mentioned, is the long-lasting agreement with the Homo Samari of Kani-Veluna, also known as Wove People, existing for the past five millennia, in particular, for serious geopolitical reasons, in the Zone of Urpea, where species meet and vessels criss-cross in a mesh of interstellar routes. This alliance has progressed since, englobing the nearby systems of Ioto and Monogu, loyal to Homo Entari ever since.

The Numi is the currency of Mars under the leadership of Homo Entari, put into service in the three main countries of Mars: Great Main, Cinta and Junica. The Numi has been used as the medium of exchange for five millennia, with, as its foremost standardiser, the cities of the Great Main under the leadership of the Elected One. Mars is led by the Ordinacy, bearer of utmost power positioning the thirty-four cities of Mars under its legitimate ascendancy. The Ordinacy was created upon the final days of Terraforming, and leads it, despite protests from nearby First Martians, and some minor resignations resurgently emerging from allies in the Asteroid Belt. The Elected One leads Mars, and the one thousand Executive Ordinates, which are loyal to the system, and to Mars. 

Homo Entaris possess a Zone in space, to rival that of Homo Ijimi, by dispossessing it of many of its asteroids. Homo Entari and Crasitids of Ijima remain in close rivalry, which has strengthened over five millennia of close competition. Crasitids form a network with the inhabitants of Protombrica, to garner influence in the Asteroid Belt. They rely on their base in Protombrica to launch intermittent attacks on their rivals, Homo Entari. Crasitids lead Ijima, the name for Jupiter within Homo Ijimi, species inhabiting that system. Homo Entaris prefer their alliance with Homo Samari, and only exert influence in their Zone. The Zone of Homo Entari dominates 3.1 septillion km^(2) within the confines of the Solar System, for the largest Zone out of the six species living in the Solarverse. 

Homo Entaris possess the largest caste of Astronauts everywhere in the Solar System, present all over the Asteroid Belt. Homo Entari culture is also very complex. With the space force at the apex, all other branches of society come after, including the engineers working on the vessels, farmers working the ecosystem, nautical engineers shaping the underwater worlds of the planet, and political leaders. Mars possesses a system worked on for years, purposefully designed, separating its branches of government into two groups of workers: Spikes and Adbols. Spikes are a caste tasked with important positions in government, while Adbols are lesser administrators, sent into faraway Provinces to undertake begrudging ministerial work. 

The planet of Homo Entari, Mars, is divided territorially into City-States and Provinces, made to house members of the Homo Entari species over the past five millennia. The territory, long adapted to house humans, also contains a number of ancient, long-lasting structures related to the transformation of the planet, such as Terraforming Stations and Sandwalls. The history of Terraformers is long and uniquely epic on Mars, especially their early effect on the Martian environment, which developed according to their influence. Across three Ages, Procreators (ancient name given to Terraformers) enhanced the newly established habitation-prone features of the planet, giving it an ocean, an atmosphere to breathe in, and a new, proliferating lush nature, engineered specially to house humans. The First Age of Terraforming occurred from 2500 to 3000, the Second Age of Terraforming occurred from 3000 to 7000, the Third Age of Terraforming is currently underway. Terraforming Tribes now exist all across the surface of Mars, faraway descendants of old Terraformers scouting all over the planet in search of prime locations in which to transform the planet. Terraforming Tribes dominate the old jungles of Mars, where they live in small communities, in villages or outposts, perched atop mountains or housed in elevated tree villages. Their villages are never visited by local authorities, due to being located in the furthest corners of Provinces. One structure that is often sighted across Mars is the notorious Terraforming Station. These structures were built by the Terraformers of old, with as its foremost target to allow Terraforming on all four corners of Mars. Finally, the famous structures known as ‘Sandwalls’ shielded towns and outposts from searing subdividing winds. These ancient structures, Terraforming Stations and Sandwalls, are mostly littered in the Provinces of the planet, as opposed to the City-States, where they remain partially disaffected. Provinces are the most sparse and extended territories of Mars, a configuration they have maintained for many centuries. Provinces contain desert nature, savannah, and the occasional outpost guaranteeing unity between the Provinces and City-States, and also contain towns specially used by the Ark, space force of Homo Entari. Many Provinces litter the grand, sparse super-continent of Mars: Nedera, Sunwata, Yonbu, Ubna, Ulduwen, Nuthundi, Yoximiun and Samarca. 

Mars is also home to Submerged Cities, arising at the origin of Terraforming. The oceans rose in the First Age of Terraforming, prior to the prolonged Second Age, which had seen polar caps melt and release carbon dioxide to perennially heat the atmosphere, after which water was added by landing icy asteroids on the surface of the planet. Water levels rose rapidly, dislocating the territory, streaming water on the north of the planet, creating two permanent, opposing sides on Mars: Uifa (meaning ‘northern ocean’), and Guia (only landmass of the planet). Many cities founded much earlier, most of which in the Age of Arrival (2100-2400), became torrentially overcome by waves arriving over them during the Rising of the Oceans. Their fate became that of eternally submerged cities lying five thousand kilometres under the ocean surface, simply laying there, amongst the coral reefs or upon sandbars. Of old, such structures resembled ancient Bubble Cities, built to house human beings in the early days of Arrival. As the oceans rose and submerged them, these cities became sunken cities. The most famous Submerged Cities are: Gregonis, Odrephas, Vaiastal and Erionis. 

The Elected One, leader of the Great Main and de facto leader of Mars, remains a recognisable figure, by the great power from which he benefits, coupled with strong, friendly ties with outer planetary systems, such as with the powerful Enzungiz of Homo Denawi on Saturn. Elected Ones are often seen partaking in important interlunar meetings on Kani-Veluna or the Zone of Urpea, or shaking hands with kings of the Solar System such as the Simakil of Homo Winisi or even the Witilmic of Homo Ijimi, with whom they share good ties. The reverence that is shown to the Elected One, however, cannot be compared with the giants of history. This goes for the two most important personalities in Martian history: the elusive personality of Seed, and the master Kai Fuo. Of the two, Seed is the most well-known, celebrated in many different feasts and ceremonies across the widest spans of Martian territory, from the Great Main to Junica, from Cinta to the First Nation. Seed was the first human being on planet Mars, vessel teetering down to the highest mound in the late 21st century, in the year 2099, deep and long-gone period of human history, and landing in the Arabia Terra region, one morning, in company of second human on Mars, Anvm Abi. Kai Fuo, on the other hand, is famous for being the inventor of Terraforming, a technique posthumously implemented to the Martian ecosystem, but originally one of his inventions. His history goes back many years, to the age immediately preceding the arrival of millions of humans in the great days of the Spread. A humble scientist occupied with experimenting on forms of Terraforming to implement on the newly habited planet of Mars, Kai Fuo allowed the technique of Terraforming to reach the shores of Mars, joyful and grateful to receive the technique, yet the great man never travelled there. His life was confined to permitting other humans to go to Mars, where they would implement his technique. The first Terraformer never reached the distant planet. 

Citizens of the Great Main, Cinta and Junica, containing the species Homo Entari, have a single religion: Elix. The rituals and traditions of Elix are encoded in a book called the Enti-Hanic, humanistic book defending the ideals professed by its priests. In the universe of the Solarverse, Elix dominates the lowest to the highest echelons of Martian society, becoming the universal religion of the planet. Elix is mirrored upon other great religions of the human race, which have come and gone throughout Martian history. The book Enti-Hanic contains thirty chapters, recounting the main facets of the religion, the history of great figures throughout its course, and a history of the Universe, central to understanding some of the other precepts of the religion. Its main figures are: Charles Darwin (the founder of the religion, as ‘discoverer of the truth of Elix’) and Alfred Russell Wallace (a great figure of Elix). Elix is also largely implemented in other systems. The cult is particularly strong on Saturn, while on Neptune, it is merged with the Terraforming religion. 

The world of Homo Entari is multifaceted and diverse, overflowing with unique cultural features stretching to the furthest dimension of which their culture is a part. For example, Homo Entaris possess a drink known as Marsquake, drunk by adults and children alike. The drink has a long history going back to the Spread, in the 2500s. In those days, many Homo Sapiens migrants had made the long-awaited crossing to Mars, in droves, ushering a new era of human presence on Mars. Needy mothers would feed their babies with carotene, blended in a concoction, to add the pigment to human skin, and parry their skin against radiation. Marsquake grew as the most widespread drink on Mars. Now, it is served in bars and cafes in the City-States of Mars. Homo Entari cuisine also developed across this species’ history, with the invention of the dish of Swaziboon, a delicious dish containing marinated pieces of meat, cold vegetables and ground aromatics.

As someone who's familiar with how things work in China, I think it may be a good idea to write a series about the big pictures hidden beneath everyday life, which of course are not welcome on Rednotes and are too long for Twitter.

The first thing I want to discuss is the healthcare system in China, which I consider probably the only uncontroversial advantage of China over the US.

Tiktok and more recently Rednotes make American hold extreme opinions towards China: either *illusorily* good, or, to the other extreme, unrealistically bad. As someone who's familiar with how things work in China, I think it may be a good idea to write a series about the big pictures hidden beneath everyday life, which of course are not welcome on Rednotes and are too long for Twitter.

The first thing I want to discuss is the healthcare system in China, which I consider probably the only uncontroversial advantage of China over the US. Therefore we want to know -

# 1. Is there any historical reason for the remarkable efficiency of the healthcare system in China?

The skeleton of the hospital systems in modern China was strongly shaped by Christian medical missions to China. These early hospitals already set up what would be known as the norm of how hospitals run: doctors were supposed to overwork and see e.g. 50 or even more patients a day, and ask for very little consultation fee, just to serve the poor population. Then CCP came, and this working culture continued in the guise of ""socialist spirit"". After the great cultural revolution, the economy was on the brink of collapse, and then the Reform and Open-up period came. Now hospitals were supposed to run as enterprises (though they were still state-owned enterprises) and make money (see below; this is known as 自负盈亏, i.e. ""shoulder profits and costs own its own""), but probably in the fear of unrest if the cost of healthcare rose too much, the price tags for consultation and for treatments were still heavily regulated - so the only way to make sure the hospitals can run was to make sure the doctors were still overworked. Hence the remarkably high speed and low cost.

Still, if you've been to a top-tier Chinese hospital, you'll notice that it offers sometimes quite advanced medical services and not just what missionary doctors stereotypically do. Therefore, we also need to ask what Chinese hospitals get right contemporarily. Therefore, we first ask:

# 2. Why is healthcare still so cheap now in China?

To answer this question, we need to understand the structure of the income of a typical Chinese hospital.

As is mentioned above, decent hospitals in China are usually state-owned, and yet they are responsible for their incomes. Local governments do provide subsidies for them, which however often make up less than 10% of the total income of a hospital. We can for example check [the structure of the income of Huashan Hospital](https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/cmsres/19/1934f16573aa4c28a8f9915327fc26c0/a3b161ba1d2b84c4132d8f99ba845b6b.pdf). We see 

* 一般公共预算财政拨款收入 6,875.02
* 事业收入 89,568.85
* 其他收入 28,509.21

Here 事业收入 just means business income. So governmental funding makes up 6875 / (6875 + 89569 + 28509) = 5.5% of the total income of the hospital.

So as you can see, the hospitals do make money by charging patients. But here is a thing: most people in China opt in the national health insurance in one way or other. There are many, many plans within the national health insurance system, depending on your job status, where you live (remember the hukou system), etc. Some of them are shitty, some of them are good. But as a whole, the national health insurance covers around [60% of the business income of all hospitals](https://www.nhsa.gov.cn/art/2024/4/10/art_52_12345.html). (The rest may be out-of-pocket payment from patients, or may come from commercial insurances.)

So you can see the national health insurance covers more than half of the total income of hospitals and definitely has a say in how these hospitals run. Definitely people running the national health insurance don't like the hospitals charging them too much, so they will do everything they can to reduce the prices. A patient pay for the medications and medical services in a hospital, both of which are partially from the health insurance fund, and therefore

* to reduce the cost of the former, the national health insurance asks hospitals to use drugs it collective purchase (集采) at *very, very* cheap prices (sometimes as cheap as bottled water) if they want to use the insurance;
* to reduce the cost of the latter, the national health insurance takes notes of what commen medical services are and inquires about how much it actually takes a hospital to perform a certain medical procedure, and then negotiate with hospitals to fix the prices.

Furthermore, for more serious diseases, the national health insurance pays hospitals according to [Diagnosis-Related Groups](https://www.nhsa.gov.cn/art/2024/4/10/art_52_12345.html) (DRGs; yes, they are explicit that they learn this from the US). When a patient is admitted, doctors formulate a diagnosis and classify the patient's situation into a DRG, and then they get a package containing a certain amount of money and a list of medical procedurals that are supposed to be used to economically treat the patient. What if the actual cost exceeds the DRG package? Well, the insurance agency will not give you one more penny: often the exceeding part goes into the hospital's deficit, and sometimes it gets deduced from the doctors' wages (so doctors who are inexperienced at treating patients *economically* sometimes need to [pay the hospital](https://www.iivd.net/thread-79261-1-1.html) to stay in their jobs).

# 3. But won't these policies hurt the qualify of medical services?

I think in the past, the medical services' quality *used to be* actually *quite ok* in general, provided that you went to the right hospital, although you can find a lot of complaints about how careless the physicians were in this sub. I don't know how they achieved it but that's my experience. Things are however changing rapidly right now.

I think the turning point is after the zero-COVID lockdown. We never really know how much money the national health insurance manages: the agency always says ""we still have plenty of money"", but rumors are the insurance fund underwent severe loss during the lockdown period. (Probably to pay for the cost of doing nucleic acid test on everyone; well, governments claim that they have separate funding sources for that, but who knows?) Anyway, what we *do* know is that the national health insurance has gone crazy in compressing costs after the COVID period. 

Alright, so now the national health insurance is pushing the prices of drugs lower and lower, and doctors and patients are now complaining that the collectively purchased drugs simply don't work. And yes, there are even anesthesiologists complaining that some patients don't fall asleep with the collectively purchased anesthetics, which they solve by giving patients doses that go above the recommended dose. 

The DRG-based system also really became a thing after COVID, and as you can see it has created a lot of trouble for doctors not familiar with its logic. But things can go worse. 

It's in theory easier for patients to get admitted into hospitals under the DRGs system, because it seems hospitals now can only charge patients what they are supposed to pay after insurance before they get admitted. Remember, in China, you first pay and then get medical services. The fees were supposed to be affordable to the middle class even without insurances (which is a side product of the national health insurance's negotiation with hospitals to reduce the amount of insurance claims, as discussed above), so you were expected to pay in full first and then get reimbursement weeks or months later. Now in theory you need to pay even *less* to get admitted into a hospital, which is good ... or is it?

The doctors know what will happen if your case is too complicated for them to solve: they'll probably exceed the DRG amount and the bill is left for *themselves* to pay. What makes things even worse is now the health insurance *denys* claims much more frequently. The hospital usually summarizes claims accumulated within a period (say a month) and then goes to the regional insurance agency. The agency now are very picky with the claims. They're like, ""this patient is classified into a wrong group!"" or ""you're trying to trick me into paying more!"" And then they will deny a part of the claims or even ask hospitals to pay penalties. And sometimes, if it is found that the amount of a DRG often leaves enough profit margin for hospitals, they'll cover less next year. Unlike the case in the US, the patient will not notice if their claim is denied: they pay their supposedly amount after insurance and they get treatment and then they leave, and now doctors are faced with bills to pay on their own, again.

The consequence is hospitals begin to choose the *right* patients - patients who are more healthy and easier to treat - and reject older patients with more complications. It's officially not allowed to directly do so, but they can always say ""sorry, but we're full right now"" or ""I think this hospital is better for you"". For patients they do admit, they tend to avoid doing, say, minimally invasive surgery, but turn to options that are cheapter but more inconvenient for the patients.

I think if the current extreme cost-squeezing policies are there to stay, the quality of public medical services and their accessibility will likely to be negatively impacted. Which leads to another topic: the rise of private hospitals (see below). Still, let's first focus on positive aspects right now. You may be wondering:

# 4. Why are public hospitals so efficient in China?

First, labor protection is a joke almost everywhere in China, and the medical profession is no exception. Chinese people particularly *expect* doctors to be saint-like (unlike programmers or manufacturing engineers, who are also forced to work long hours as well but no one thinks it's their moral duty to do so). A US doctor probably see around 20 patients a day. Their Chinese counterpart? Maybe 50 or even 100 or even more. 

But it's not just consultation. One thing good in Chinese public hospitals is that the whole hospital is *pipelined*. The underlying assumption is that most patients do not have anything serious, so they don't deserve time from doctors. For instance, suppose you feel pain in your stomach. You pay for a small consultation fee (several dollars) to get into a line to see a specialist, who will quickly ask you symptoms (in like five minutes) and refer you to do an ultrasound test. So you pay again (like 20 dollars) to see a radiologist, who usually has a ""nothing serious"" attitude and will do a rather rough ultrasound scan, which takes no longer than 10 minutes. And then you go back to your specialist (again wait in a line), and he casually has a glance at your report and says ""you're all good!"" And you're free to go.

So now you see the point: the system runs in a ""nothing wrong until proven otherwise"" mode. It is under this assumption that the system runs in a pipelined way. In the US we also have this, it's called doc in a box, but we don't have *radiaologists in a box*. In China the whole hospital by default runs in the doc-in-a-box mode - until they find something seriously wrong. So there is a saying in China: if the doctor has a very bad attitude towards you, it means you're healthy, but if a doctor takes you seriously, well, good luck.

It should be noted that not every doctor works like a doc in a box in China. There are two types of clinical services. One is 普通门诊 or ""generic clinic"", which works in the pipelined way sketched above. Another is 特需门诊 or ""special-need clinic"", which runs in the American way. In 特需门诊, the consultation fee is much higher, say $100 or $200, usually still cheaper than consultation fees in the US, but they are of the same order of magnitude. Nowadays many senior specialists tend to have more appointments in 特需门诊, i.e. they work in the American way. But young doctors always start their careers at 普通门诊. 

You may argue that working in a medical streamline makes young doctors more experienced. Most patients, after all, have typical medical problems, so when treating these patients en masse, young doctors are essentially reviewing their textbooks over and over again. 

Alright, so suppose you're a 45-year-old doctor who has survived your job in 普通门诊, and has published enough papers to upgrade your professional title (for some reasons, in China, doctors are expected to publish research papers, which are often about fundamental biomedical science and not direct clinical practices, this of course encourages academic misconducts and means some seemingly very experienced doctors do not really have enough clinical skiils, but that's another topic), and now what can you do with your fame in the medical profession? You want to treat patients with challenging medical situations? Mind their DRGs, or otherwise *you*'re going to pay for their bills! But you do have an option - 

# 5. The rise of private hospitals

The cost control measures of DRGs and collective purchasing means public hospitals had better focus on satisfying simple, everyday needs of patients if they don't want to go bankrupt. And this is a change for private hospitals to rise. There has long been more private hospitals than public ones in China. Private hospitals generally have less advanced infrastructures, but [the problem is getting better](http://www.kanyijie.com/details?id=1485), and now it's not uncommon for private hospitals to attract senior doctors in public hospitals to do part-time jobs at their places. I saw an example on a social network platform (for privacy reasons I'll not show the link): a surgeon told his patient: ""if you choose to do the operation here, you'll wait for a month, but if you go to xxx hospital, things can move faster."" The latter, of course, is more expensive than the former.

# Discussion

Tankies often brag about how successful the Chinese medical system is. We have seen that the toolbox it has is comparable to the toolbox of medical systems in democracies: there is no communist hocus pocus that magically provides good medical services at low cost to all.  China, however, managed to use them *together* to create a public healthcare system that's still quite remarkable at least for now, although as is discussed in section 3, the quality of its services seems to be in concerning decline, and a non-zero chance is that eventually it will be another Malaysia. Still, it provides many insights for other countries:

* A strong national health insurance can really do a lot: the more people participate in it, the stronger its status is on the negotiation table.
* Many patients don't really need very careful examinations, and a pipelined, ""move fast until you notice something"" medical system will greatly ease the waiting time.
* Probably the insurance shoudn't be allowed to squeeze the price too much...

The Relentless Ingenuity,HFY,1i7v4m8,2025-01-22 23:14:48,109,0.95,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i7v4m8/the_relentless_ingenuity/,Ligeia194,OC,"In the year 2389, the ship that would become a legend drifted through the quiet expanse of space. Its name was UNSS Resolute, and it was a relic by most standards: an aging hull reinforced with steel and composite plating, propelled by fusion-driven engines that sometimes rattled and threatened to stall at the slightest hiccup. But for Captain Elena Maro, who paced the worn metal of the command deck each day, there was no place she would rather be. The Resolute had saved colonies from pirates, delivered relief supplies to war-torn outposts, and carried human spirit beyond the confines of Earth’s solar system. Now, it patrolled the lonely orbits of a small planet called Demeter-4—a fringe world that the far-larger Galactic Concord scarcely noticed.

Humanity had joined the Galactic Concord only a decade earlier, granting them official membership in a glittering coalition of advanced species. For centuries, Earth had fumbled alone with technologies that other civilizations considered archaic: ballistic weaponry, analog redundancies, radio transmissions, and older forms of propulsion. When Earth’s diplomats brokered that first treaty, they stepped onto the grand Concord stage to discover entire starfaring empires that harnessed energy lances, faster-than-light wave drives, and AI-driven defense networks. Humanity was accepted as a provisional member, but condescending whispers filled the corridors of Concord stations. Humans were too fragile, their ships too primitive, their lifespan too short, their technology a pale reflection of the wonders these other species enjoyed. Admirals shook their heads at the “relic ships” humans insisted on maintaining, claiming that ballistic cannons were a relic of barbaric ages.

Yet Captain Elena Maro believed in the value of the old ways. She liked that the Resolute’s systems had mechanical backups and gunpowder-based triggers for emergency thrusters. She liked that the railguns fired tungsten slugs at velocities that made even sophisticated sensors squeal in protest. If anyone called her ship a museum piece, she would nod and say, “A museum piece that has never failed to come back.” When some young Concord liaison pointed out that the entire human fleet used “outmoded systems,” she would just smile. Something about the tangibility of steel and explosive propulsion comforted her. In an age of exotic energy weapons and fancy shield harmonics, maybe there was value in the straightforward punch of physical ammunition.

Her first officer, Darius Cole, stood at the tactical console on the Resolute’s bridge that day, scanning for the usual suspects: petty criminals, smugglers, and perhaps roving pirates who might threaten Demeter-4. The planet itself was a world of storms, its atmosphere frequently battered by swirling dust clouds. But humans had settled under geodesic domes, forging farmland out of red-tinged soil and building a modest society in an environment few other Concord races found appealing. Elena herself—dark hair cropped short, uniform sleeves rolled to her elbows—made a habit of gazing down at that ochre surface each morning, as if checking to make sure the colony still held together.

On that particular afternoon, the first tremor of destiny arrived in the form of a priority transmission from Concord Central Command. Lieutenant Valentina Cortez, perched at the communications station, tapped a series of keys to bring up a holographic display. An emblem of the Concord spun there, depicting an array of interlinked stars. A moment later, the image resolved into the face of Admiral Thalax. He was an Orvani, tall and slender, with an elongated skull and skin that shimmered in gradients of blue. His eyelids closed and opened in that distinctly alien blink pattern, and his beaklike mouth clicked slightly before he spoke.

“Captain Maro,” he said in a clipped voice, “I trust you are well. I regret that my purpose in contacting you is not a pleasant one.” Elena folded her arms, noticing a faint tremor in Thalax’s tone that she had never heard before. He was typically confident to the point of arrogance, especially when addressing humans. “I must inform you,” he continued, “that the Galactic Concord has encountered a cataclysmic threat. The Devourer Swarm has been confirmed on the outer edges of our territory.”

Elena stood straighter. Cole, behind her, leaned forward at the mention of the Devourer Swarm. There were rumors: self-replicating machines rumored to have driven entire species into extinction, fleets of artificial vessels that consumed planetary resources, forging more and more copies of themselves. Some said they were unstoppable because they adapted to any known technology, twisting advanced weapons into raw data that they used to build new defenses.

Thalax explained that Concord warfleets had already attempted to halt the Swarm, but every time a new type of energy weapon was deployed—plasma arcs, quantum lances, psionic wave cannons—the Devourers adapted. They rearranged their molecular plating or scrambled the energy signatures so quickly that the Concord was left firing blanks. Already, half a dozen fringe systems had been devoured, stripped of life and minerals, entire worlds left as barren husks.

“Because of these dire developments,” Thalax said, “the High Council has issued an emergency order to evacuate all outer colonies, effective immediately. We will consolidate our defenses around more crucial sectors. I trust humanity will follow this directive without delay. The Swarm is converging on your region, and Demeter-4 is unsalvageable.” He paused, then offered an almost perfunctory nod. “I advise you to join the evacuation corridor. Thalax out.”

The screen blinked back to the rotating Concord emblem before dissolving entirely. For a moment, the bridge of the Resolute was silent, save for the soft hum of the air recyclers. Elena exhaled, pressing her hands against the nearest console. If the Concord warfleets—bristling with technology centuries ahead of humanity’s—could not repel the Devourers, then what chance did a patchwork of old Earth ships have? Yet the idea of abandoning fifty thousand colonists to be chewed up by an unstoppable force made her stomach turn. She had spent the last decade ensuring that outlying colonies would never again feel deserted.

“Captain,” Cole said gently, “what do we do now?” He glanced at the planet below on the main viewscreen, the swirling dust storms tinted by the sun’s rays. “If the Concord says the threat is unstoppable, maybe we can at least evacuate.” But as soon as he spoke, doubt clouded his face. Even the best Terran transport vessels in the system would fail to carry everyone quickly enough, and an evacuation on short notice would be chaos.

Lieutenant Cortez cleared her throat. “Picking up a data stream from the Concord. It’s the official evacuation protocol, a set of jump coordinates… but no actual help. They’re not dispatching additional ships to help these people.”

Elena studied the ragged feed of sensor data from the system’s perimeter. Already there were signs of the Devourer Swarm: hundreds of small craft drifting near an asteroid cluster, apparently dismantling it for resources. That cluster was two days’ travel from Demeter-4. She clenched her fists. “I’m not leaving those colonists to die. If the Concord runs, that’s on their conscience, but it won’t be on mine.” She set her jaw. “Inform Governor Thandi Morais on Demeter-4 that the Resolute is staying to help in any way we can. If we can’t stop the Swarm entirely, maybe we can slow it enough to get some people out.”

Before her words had even fully registered with the crew, the general quarters alert sounded, and the ship buzzed with activity. In a dimly lit briefing room, Elena, Cole, Cortez, and Engineer Raj Patel gathered around a holographic table that displayed fuzzy sensor echoes of the Swarm. No one in the Concord had ever bested them in a major engagement, and yet Patel was rummaging through old intelligence files, pointing to a single footnote.

“Here,” he said, tapping the display. “Someone observed that the Devourers basically ignore ballistic weaponry. They consider it so primitive that they never used their adaptive algorithms on it. Concord’s official stance has always been that ballistic weapons are obsolete. But maybe, in this case, that’s our key advantage.”

Cole frowned. “Are you suggesting we slug it out with tungsten rounds against a fleet that tore through quantum lances?” Patel nodded firmly. “Railguns might seem laughable to the Concord, but the Devourers have always faced advanced energy weapons. They’re not expecting an ‘outdated’ kinetic approach.”

Elena let that sink in. The Resolute did have railguns, but would it be enough to take on a swarm that devoured entire planets? Maybe not alone. Yet there had to be a chance. The plan, such as it was, formed in her mind: lure parts of the Swarm away, whittle them down, and prevent them from making a full, overwhelming strike on the colony. The longer she could buy, the more colonists could flee, or perhaps even dig in and fortify. A flicker of hope kindled in her chest.

She contacted Governor Morais, whose haggard face appeared on the comm screen. “We appreciate the warning from the Concord, Captain,” Morais said, her voice heavy with exhaustion. “But do they expect us to uproot an entire colony? We have farmland, water reclamation, thousands of children—this is our home. We can’t just leave with a wave of a hand.” Elena explained her plan, or at least her intent to fight. Morais’s eyes shone with gratitude, though fear lingered in them. “Thank you, Captain,” the governor whispered. “Even if we can save only some of our people, it’s better than none.”

The next two days passed in a frantic blur of engineering efforts, tactical planning, and anxious scans of the expanding Swarm presence. Patel oversaw a gargantuan retrofit of the cargo bays and hangars into makeshift ammunition foundries. Salvaged metal from broken satellites, disused terraforming equipment, and heaps of old circuit boards arrived from the planet’s surface. Patel’s idea was to craft specialized EMP warheads: place a localized electromagnetic burst at the tip of each railgun slug. If triggered on impact, it might scramble Swarm systems that were designed to adapt to energy-based threats. Whether it would be enough to disable entire ships remained unknown, but it was worth trying. The cargo hold glowed with sparks of welding torches, and the air smelled of scorched metal. Crew and volunteers toiled in shifts around the clock. Elena took time to inspect the progress each evening, a quiet determination in her every footstep.

The Swarm advanced faster than expected. Word reached the Resolute that the Concord battle groups that had engaged them on the outer perimeter were thoroughly routed. The surviving Concord warships had chosen to jump away, leaving the fringe to its fate. Morais broadcast a desperate plea for more time, explaining that only one starliner and a scattering of smaller freighters could attempt to evacuate a portion of Demeter-4’s inhabitants. The rest would be forced to shelter in place. Elena promised to hold the line as best she could, though a knot of fear twisted in her gut.

When the Swarm’s first wave emerged from fold-space near an asteroid belt within the Demeter system, Elena knew the moment had come. The Resolute powered down its main reactors, drifting among tumbling rocks. A series of old-fashioned radio beacons had been scattered around, transmitting static-laced signals that the Devourers struggled to parse. It was an unthinkable method for advanced Concord tacticians, who preferred stealth fields or encryption algorithms. But humanity’s older ways turned out to be perfect for confounding the Swarm.

Teardrop-shaped enemy drones slipped into the belt, scanning for resources. Through the ship’s viewport, Elena caught glimpses of metallic hulls that pulsed with an eerie black sheen. Without waiting, she gave the order to fire. The railguns spoke in thunderclaps. Projectiles streaked out, slamming into the nearest drones with enough kinetic force to rend them into shards. A hush fell on the Resolute’s bridge as they realized it had worked: the old ballistic ammunition had torn through advanced machines like they were made of tin foil. Lieutenant Cortez let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. They reloaded quickly, hurling another volley, catching the drones before they could fully scatter.

But the Devourers were not mindless. After a handful of kills, the drones zipped out of the line of fire, weaving past the radio decoys. They began to map the asteroid belt with cold precision, hunting for the source of the ballistic salvos. The humans engaged in a deadly hide-and-seek, picking off a few more stragglers before the swarm’s forward scouts withdrew. Elena’s relief was short-lived. A new contact flared on the sensors: a large Devourer capital ship hovering just beyond the asteroid field, scanning for ways to circumvent the humans’ archaic tactics.

“It’s not turning away,” Cole observed grimly. “They’ll come back in force.” Elena nodded. They had given Demeter-4 a small respite, but the next assault would be punishing. As if to confirm that, a second wave of drones tried to box the Resolute into a corner. Elena ordered the ship to accelerate out of the field, railguns hammering a path through the swirl of mechanical foes. A tense silence gripped the crew as they finally broke free and made a beeline for Demeter-4. The Devourers, though damaged, were nowhere near finished.

In orbit, Elena prepared for the worst. She sent out a sector-wide message on all old-fashioned frequencies. “To any human vessels within range, this is Captain Elena Maro of the UNSS Resolute. We are facing an imminent Devourer threat. The Concord has chosen to evacuate. We will not. If you have the will to fight, bring every bullet, every hull, and every stubborn soul you can spare. We’ll hold them as long as we can.” She didn’t know if anyone would actually come. Over the years, humanity had spread to dozens of mining outposts and frontier stations, though many remained fiercely independent. With luck, some might answer the call.

The next day, faint sensor pings heralded new arrivals dropping out of FTL. Elena’s heart lifted when she saw the silhouettes of old cargo haulers, battered salvage ships, even some ex-military corvettes that had been retired and sold to private owners. One by one, they broadcast back: “We’re here, Captain. Let’s take the fight to them.” From the Resolute’s bridge, the comm channels erupted in a Babel of human accents—captains offering small arsenals of ballistic missiles, or armed mining vessels fitted with coil cannons that launched chunks of ore. By Concord standards, it looked like a chaotic gathering of rust buckets. But to Elena, it was the purest representation of humanity’s resolve.

In that moment of renewed hope, the Devourer swarm arrived in full force, blotting out swaths of starlight with their mass. The largest among them—a towering mothership, wreathed in rotating arms that bristled with forging pods—approached the planet’s orbit. Smaller enemy craft peeled away to engage the defenders. The ad hoc human fleet unleashed everything in one roaring salvo. Railguns, coil cannons, flak shells, and improvised ballistic rockets streaked across the void. The Swarm, designed to counter sophisticated beams and hyper-intelligent targeting, struggled to adapt to the physical slugs ripping through its flanks. Drones exploded in silent flashes. Larger hulls took hits that tore straight through their plating. Cheers erupted on several comm channels.

Yet the Swarm was vast, always shifting. Waves of new drones emerged from the mothership’s maw, swirling in bizarre patterns to avoid direct hits. The entire starry backdrop lit up with muzzle flashes. Some human vessels found themselves cornered, hammered by beams that sliced through hulls. Over and over, the defenders hammered slugs into the attackers, but the Devourers’ sheer numbers threatened to overwhelm them. The horizon of Demeter-4 flickered with gloom as infiltration pods began a descent to the planet’s atmosphere. Everyone knew that once the swarm established a beachhead, it would start strip-mining and forging more drones on the ground.

In the thick of it, the Resolute fought like a beast. Patrol craft formed up on its flanks, unleashing coordinated volleys. Elder Krell, the Xandran strategist, then appeared on a private sub-channel. His deep, rasping voice offered an unexpected lifeline. “Captain Maro, I have come with kinetic bombardment satellites once used by the Concord centuries ago,” he announced from the vantage of his personal cruiser. “The High Council will not stop me from offering them now. We must strike quickly.” Though official Concord fleets had retreated, Krell saw the brilliance in humanity’s approach. Elena had little time to respond. “We welcome any help,” she said, “and thank you for standing with us.”

New icons flickered onto the tactical map: old Concord satellites, each loaded with tungsten rods that could be hurled at monstrous velocities, entirely ballistic in nature. They hammered the edges of the mothership, causing localized shield fluctuations. Darius Cole, stifling an excited outburst, reported that the mothership’s outer plating had begun to fail in spots. If they could exploit those failures, maybe they could deliver a decisive blow.

But the mothership was massive, with layered defenses that even ballistic shells would need time to penetrate. As the smaller Devourer ships swarmed about, Elena sensed the tipping point approaching: the cost in human vessels was rising fast, and each moment gave the Devourers more chance to replicate. Once they compensated for the ballistic threat, it was over. Patel, in the Resolute’s engine bay, sent a frantic call to the bridge: “Captain, if we can get an EMP warhead right into the mothership’s interior, that might knock out its adaptation core. But we’d have to physically breach the hull before detonating, or it won’t reach the central systems.”

Elena glanced around. They had a handful of large warheads left. If they tried a standard missile run, the Swarm would intercept. The only surefire way to ensure the payload found its mark would be a direct collision. She felt a chill settle in her spine as she realized what that meant. “We ram them,” she said into the comm channel, voice hollow. Cole stared at her, wide-eyed, but in the swirl of alarms and rattling overhead conduits, the logic was clear. She cut the shipwide channel to order an emergency evacuation for all non-essential personnel, telling them to get to the escape pods.

Cole balked. “Captain, at least let me stay,” he managed, tears in his eyes. Elena shook her head. “I need someone to coordinate the rest of the fleet if we manage to pull this off. That someone is you. Now go.” In the frantic final minutes, the corridors echoed with shouts and heavy footfalls as crew members strapped themselves into lifeboats. Elena remained on the bridge, overriding the autopilot so the Resolute could charge straight for the mothership’s largest structural gap.

The battered starship lurched forward. The hull plating peeled as Devourer drones fired on it, but still it surged. Elena engaged every thruster, forcing the engines to roar. Under the hail of energy beams, the Resolute’s deck shuddered violently. Alarm klaxons blared, yet she held her course, heart hammering. With unwavering calm, she opened a channel to all humans still fighting alongside her: “They think we’re weak because we feel fear. But fear’s why we fight harder. We’ve got one shot—let’s make it count.” Then came the impact. The front of the Resolute tore into the mothership’s exposed flank, shredding both hulls in a spectacular collision. In that split-second, Elena slammed her palm onto the manual detonator. The experimental EMP warheads exploded in a wave of white light that flooded the entire battlespace, shorting out every delicate system within range.

Darius Cole, drifting in an escape pod with tears streaming, stared in awe as the massive flash of energy rippled through the Devourers. Their once-fluid formations froze or spun out of control as adaptive circuitry fried. The swarm that had been unstoppable against the Concord’s advanced beams now found itself paralyzed. Human ships still operational took this chance to pour slug after slug into the crippled machines. Kinetic bombardment satellites slammed tungsten rods into the mothership’s hull. Soon, the rest of the swarm either exploded or fled the system in aimless retreat.

Euphoria and horror mingled among the victorious humans. They had saved Demeter-4 from annihilation—but the Resolute was gone, consumed in the detonation that crippled the mothership. Elena Maro’s signal vanished from every comm channel. A wave of sorrow rolled through those who had known her. Escape pods were recovered, bringing back some of the crew alive, though many had been lost in the collision. On the planet below, Governor Morais and her people wept and celebrated in the same breath when they learned that the monstrous threat had been broken.

News traveled across the galaxy at lightspeed. The story of how a “primitive” human warship succeeded where the Concord’s mightiest armadas had failed caught fire in public discourse. Many Concord admirals tried to dismiss it, but momentum grew as more witnesses testified. The entire galaxy seemed stunned. Admiral Thalax, under immense political pressure, delivered an official apology that many found halfhearted. He praised the “valor of Captain Maro and her crew,” yet it was obvious how sharply it contrasted with the Concord’s chosen retreat. Meanwhile, Elder Krell publicly lauded human ingenuity and pointed out that Earth’s ballistic weaponry succeeded simply because it had never been considered a serious threat. Krell argued this oversight revealed a systemic flaw in the Concord’s doctrine: reliance on advanced energies had become a dangerous blind spot.

In the following weeks, salvage teams combed the debris field around Demeter-4’s orbit. They found the Resolute’s black box, floating amid twisted beams. Lieutenant Cortez, Cole, and Patel huddled in a cramped salvage craft, listening as the damaged recorder crackled with Elena’s last words: “If you’re hearing this, I hope that means we stopped them. The galaxy thinks humans are fragile because we bleed. But that’s precisely why we fight. Tell our families we gave everything for them. Tell them we believed in something bigger than ourselves. And if there’s still a fight to be had… fight it with every bit of our courage. We’ve earned our place in this galaxy. Maro out.” Cole’s face was streaked with tears by the time the message concluded.

A grand memorial ceremony took shape on Earth’s orbital platform, Alexandria Station, where a transparent dome overlooked the planet’s swirling blue surface. Delegations from nearly every Concord species gathered, from the tall, avian Orvani to the reptilian Xandrans and more. A hush fell as representatives recounted the victory over the Devourers, a victory few had believed possible. Governor Morais, wearing the dust-stained formal dress of Demeter-4’s pioneer council, spoke about how the Resolute refused to abandon her people. When Admiral Thalax took the stage, he stumbled through an expression of regret, claiming this moment was a sobering lesson for Concord command. In a voice tinged with both sorrow and pride, Thalax conceded that humans showed “unmatched resolve in the face of unimaginable threat.”

With the eyes of the galaxy upon them, the Concord soon announced the formation of the Terra Vanguard, a task force dedicated to “adaptive warfare,” led primarily by human officers who had demonstrated the cunning and improvisation necessary to deal with threats like the Devourer Swarm. Where once ballistic weaponry had been laughed off, it now entered the standard Concord arsenal for specialized missions. The battered survivors of the Resolute took leading roles in training programs, teaching alien recruits how to think unconventionally in battle. The memory of Elena Maro’s sacrifice served as the moral center for this new force.

But the story did not end there. Rumors persisted that a lone escape pod, or partial life capsule, had been detected in the mothership’s wreckage after that final EMP blast. Conflicting sensor logs suggested someone might have ejected at the last second, though no conclusive proof emerged. Some months later, a small salvager reported stumbling across a drifting pod near the edges of known Concord space, with no occupant inside but faint traces of human DNA. As though carved in shaky letters, there was one message burned into the interior plating: “Tell them humanity isn’t done yet.” The name Elena Maro was not written anywhere, but every rumor pointed in her direction.

Few believed that Elena could have survived such destruction, yet the possibilities sparked something powerful in the hearts of every human living on the fringe. Even among the Concord, quiet speculation took root. If she was gone, it was a heroic death in the greatest cause: saving a colony from unimaginable extinction. And if she lived somewhere on the edge of the galaxy, battered and alone, then perhaps she was still carving messages into metal scraps, waiting for someone to find her.

For Demeter-4, the rebuilding was swift and resolute. Despite the chaos, most of the colony’s infrastructure survived, thanks to the quick intervention of the human fleet. Farmers returned to their domes, children returned to newly secured schools, and battered landing pads played host to the salvage ships that continued to arrive with vital supplies. The planet soon became a symbol of humanity’s refusal to surrender in the face of crisis. A new generation grew up hearing stories of “the old ship that saved us,” and many wore patches of the Resolute’s insignia in tribute.

Within the Terra Vanguard, Darius Cole rose to the rank of commander, bearing the memory of the captain who gave her life so that others could stand. Raj Patel oversaw an entire division dedicated to “analog solutions,” turning humanity’s timeworn engineering instincts into standard procedures for the Concord’s newly expanded arsenal. Lieutenant Cortez found herself briefing alien officers on how something as simple as a radio decoy could bring advanced logic routines to a grinding halt. Skeptical admirals gradually recognized that the future might require blending the Concord’s advanced science with the raw, unorthodox grit of Earth’s traditions.

When asked to reflect on Captain Maro’s legacy, Elder Krell would say, “She taught us that being advanced does not simply mean having the greatest technology. It means having the courage to improvise under pressure, the will to stand for what is right, and the humility to realize that sometimes old solutions can triumph where new ones fail.” That sentiment spread, especially among younger Concord officers who no longer viewed humanity with casual dismissal. It became a rallying cry for those who believed in the synergy of different approaches.

Meanwhile, far from the bustling core, among the swirling cosmic dust of half-forgotten routes, rumors continued to emerge of faint signals in an archaic analog format. Freighters swore they picked up a voice that sounded human, calling itself “Maro.” Investigations found only scraps or dead ends, fueling an almost mythic legend that Elena had somehow survived the devastation. Others said it was merely the echo of old black-box transmissions drifting in the void. Either way, it inspired a sense that the story was not over.

For the people of Earth, the memorial at Alexandria Station remained a solemn reminder of what it took to earn respect in the galaxy. A statue was erected—a stylized depiction of the Resolute plowing headlong into an imposing silhouette representing the Devourer mothership, with a plaque that read: *“In memory of Captain Elena Maro and all who fought with her, proving that courage and sacrifice can transcend even the mightiest foe.”* Floral wreaths, crystals from other worlds, and small tokens from human families decorated the statue’s base. Over time, even Concord ambassadors paid their respects there.

Despite the official narrative that Elena Maro had died a hero, certain corners of the Terra Vanguard refused to close the book. Cole quietly directed resources to scanning uncharted systems, hoping against hope that they might locate evidence of her survival. Patel refined prototypes of advanced life-pod trackers that combined ballistic resilience with stealth shielding, stating that if there was ever a next time, no one would be lost in such a manner. Cortez tried to decode rogue transmissions, sifting through signals that might contain coded references to the lost captain. Each dead end cast a new wave of sorrow, but the faint possibility that she might be out there kept them going.

Across the galaxy, the Devourer Swarm had been humbled—but not annihilated. Concord intelligence suggested that the mechanical threat had fractured into smaller groups, each retreating to distant corners of known space. Emboldened by the humans’ success, other Concord members began outfitting older vessels with ballistic cannons and EMP-based warheads. The message was clear: the unstoppable wave had been halted, showing that no adversary was truly invincible. A subtle but profound shift occurred in the galactic hierarchy, where formerly condescending admirals now sought out the input of human tacticians. Some declared it a new era, one in which the Concord finally embraced the synergy of tradition and innovation.

Demeter-4, once a neglected dust world, slowly developed into a thriving hub. The planetary council built a statue of Captain Maro in their central dome, her likeness standing tall, gazing upward with unyielding resolve. Elders taught younger generations how one battered ship had disobeyed Concord orders to save them from oblivion. Humanity’s bond with that colony grew stronger than ever, and soon Earth began exporting practical ballistic technology throughout the region, forging alliances with other worlds that also felt dismissed by the Concord’s old guard. People from a hundred star systems visited Demeter-4 to witness the place where “the unstoppable was stopped.”

Over the years, the memory of the Resolute’s final moment grew into a legend retold in countless ways. Some said the captain’s last words had been a roar of defiance; others believed she had calmly whispered a farewell into the black box. The truth was captured in that single line she broadcast to the fleet, the line that sparked a new sense of identity: *“They think we’re weak because we feel fear. But fear’s why we fight harder.”* That unassuming statement was quoted in holovids, in speeches, in a thousand official briefings about how the Concord must evolve to face future threats. The concept resonated with more than just humans; many alien societies, once proud and reticent to admit vulnerability, discovered renewed purpose in the notion that fear could be a source of strength.

Rumors of Elena Maro’s possible survival took on an almost mystical quality. Every so often, a smuggler or explorer would claim they had seen a lone figure with short-cropped dark hair on a derelict station near the edge of Concord space. They swore she was searching for a ride back home, or leaving cryptic messages scratched on metal walls. Yet no one presented definitive proof. Eventually, a small cargo vessel reported discovering an abandoned life pod near the wreckage of an old Devourer capital ship. The occupant was gone, but etched in the charred interior was a single line: *“Tell them humanity isn’t done yet.”* That story spread like wildfire, fueling even more speculation.

And so humanity pressed on, carrying that spark of hope. Elena’s sacrifice had shown the galaxy that even the lowliest “primitive” could shatter the illusions of invincibility. Though the Concord might never admit it outright, the name Elena Maro became synonymous with relentless ingenuity, the kind of unbreakable will that recognized a losing battle and chose to fight anyway. Historians would later mark the Destruction of the Devourer Mothership at Demeter-4 as a turning point in relations between Earth and the Concord. That was when humans, once mocked, took the lead in forging new defensive doctrines that integrated the very ballistic technology once deemed obsolete.

Wherever Elena might be—truly lost or simply beyond the next star cluster—her legacy remained etched into every shell fired by the Terra Vanguard, every battered cargo freighter that arrived at a threatened colony, and every survivor who had witnessed the unstoppable swarm turn tail under the fury of slug-based weaponry. The galaxy changed in those moments, pivoting away from complacency. The Devourers would surely evolve again, or other threats would emerge. But now there was no question that the so-called “primitive” species were anything but. Their creativity, fueled by courage, would forever be a beacon.

Long after the final data logs had been stored away and the surviving crew found new posts across the Terra Vanguard, the story continued to ripple through cosmic trade routes and quiet frontier taverns. People recounted how, against all sense, an old warship named the Resolute chose to stand its ground. How its captain placed faith in an arsenal of outmoded kinetics, and how, in one glorious instant, she rammed the unstoppable beast and drove an EMP spike into its heart. How that single act spared thousands of families on Demeter-4 and taught an arrogant Concord that technology alone did not define superiority.

Time moved on. Children who grew up under the protective dome on Demeter-4 were told the tale of Captain Maro as both cautionary lesson and inspiration. Some would go on to join the Terra Vanguard, brandishing railguns or fusion rifles that combined the best of Earth’s grit with the best of alien design. Others stayed behind, safeguarding the farmland and carrying the knowledge that they owed their lives to one ship’s defiance.

In the hush of the cosmos, where drifting scraps of metal occasionally glinted under distant starlight, it was said that the soul of the Resolute remained. A battered chunk of plating spinning in silence might bear the insignia that read *UNSS Resolute*. Those who saw it would pause, saluting the memory of a crew that refused to abandon hope. Some claimed they could sense Captain Maro’s presence there, a warrior’s spirit that refused to die, certain that humanity still had more stories to write in the grand panorama of the galactic frontier.

Whether or not Elena Maro truly survived was, in the end, almost beside the point. What mattered was that her final stand became the rallying cry: *“They dismissed our primitive tools, but forgot they were wielded by an advanced species. We call it courage.”* That line, repeated by starship captains and whispered around campfires, became the unifying principle of Earth’s new place in the galaxy. It reminded all of them—Concord or otherwise—that what made humans “advanced” was not the technology they carried, but the spirit driving them onward. So, even if the stars eventually grew cold or the Devourers rose again in some distant quadrant, the memory of the Resolute’s unstoppable charge would linger, urging the living to fight harder, find new solutions, and never, ever discount the power of fear-turned-courage.

Thus, the battered colony on Demeter-4 healed, and the Concord reorganized around the lesson that simple kinetic energy could humble the mightiest foe when guided by relentless determination. Elder Krell, quietly vindicated, took great pride in his choice to support the humans. Admiral Thalax, publicly humbled, could only watch as the Terra Vanguard evolved into a formidable line of defense. The children under Demeter’s dome grew up to be farmers, traders, and starship officers who carried the torch of Elena’s example into every new horizon.

Some years passed. A small salvage craft exploring beyond the mapped frontier reported stumbling across a small vessel drifting among the remnants of what once might have been a Devourer staging area. The pilot, perplexed, described seeing faint human signage before the wreck disappeared from sensor range. He thought he glimpsed someone, or something, drifting away in a battered suit. When asked for details, all he could offer was a single line etched into a twisted piece of hull: *“Tell them humanity isn’t done yet.”* Whether or not he believed it was Captain Maro, the message spread once again, lighting a spark of excitement and faith. One rumor, one possibility, that perhaps the unstoppable spirit of that short-haired captain still roamed the stars, searching for a way home or forging a new legend somewhere in the cosmic darkness.

And so, the story lived on, woven into every railgun slug fired in the Terra Vanguard’s training halls, whispered in the corridors of Concord academies where new cadets learned that advanced technology alone was not enough. It became a piece of living history, reminding everyone that a single act of selfless defiance could echo far beyond its moment. In that echo, entire civilizations found hope. For in the face of unimaginable threats, in a galaxy trembling under a mechanical swarm, it was that old, rusted ship and its courageous captain that offered a resolute truth: when humanity’s back was against the wall, its fear became fuel, and its simplest weapons, wielded with cunning and heart, could topple even the mightiest adversaries. No matter how far the Devourers spread, no matter how advanced the rest of the Concord might become, the quiet vow repeated by those who remembered the Resolute would hold: *We call it courage. We call it sacrifice. We call it humanity.* And as long as such spirit endured, no threat could fully silence the species that thrived on challenge, overcame impossible odds, and redefined the boundaries of what it meant to be truly strong."
"It is July 1942. Through the fires of the Second American Civil War, Second Weltkrieg, and countless other conflicts across the globe, it appears that the old order will hold.",Kaiserreich,1i7tf7d,2025-01-22 21:44:49,14,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/comments/1i7tf7d/it_is_july_1942_through_the_fires_of_the_second/,Impressive-Ad-8863,AAR,"In America, Alf Landon's victory in the 1936 election led many to hope that the United States would survive the twin crises of the Great Depression and Black Monday intact. However, after negotiations with the radical politicians Huey Long and Jack Reed were marred by scandal, General Douglas MacArthur led an unlawful military coup of Landon's government and declared himself the provisional President, establishing a military junta and placing Landon under house arrest. Seeing their chance, Reed and Long rallied their paramilitaries and forced governors in their power bases of the Deep South and Great Lakes to declare their allegiance to their competing governments. MacArthur quickly abandoned the East and retreated to Denver, but the stubborn resistance of the states of Washington, Oregon, and California under Vice President Charles McNary, who was in Seattle at the time of the coup, thwarted the general's attempt at unifying the Western United States against the radicals. Seeing this, the governors of the states of New York, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine requested the assistance of the Canadian government, who quickly moved in and formed a provisional American government in New England - but not before Long Island was conquered by syndicalist revolutionaries, who bathed the streets of New York in blood as they ransacked the city in search of the rich and powerful who were unable to escape the violence. Indeed, many Americans were horrified by the bloodshed unleashed by Reed and his Red Guard militias, and sought to flee to New England's provisional government, which was as of yet neutral in the conflict.

Quickly, safehouses were organized near the New English border. Through a network of contacts in many Northeastern states, thousands were helped to safety via the Second Underground Railroad. In fact, some of these escapees would join the newly formed New English Army. With support from their Canadian backers and an influx of potential new recruits, the New English Army would be organized into an elite fighting force. Using expertise from everywhere they could get it, the army of New England was drilled over the course of 18 months into one of the highest-quality armies in the Second American Civil War.

Unfortunately, Reed's army saw extraordinary success in that time. First was Long's government, with Red Guardsmen reaching the streets of New Orleans in late 1938. Then, his militias turned west, laying waste to MacArthur's junta in a matter of months. With the prospect of a syndicalist America threatening to tear down all that New England and its people had worked so hard to do and the hopes and dreams of the British Exiles, it became clear that action was needed. With the New English Army now in prime condition, on May 12th, 1939, a joint declaration of war was issued by the Canadian and New English governments.

https://preview.redd.it/u7fbemy7pnee1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd608e6e186909eb733a7e2132a92db6359bcdc4

Entente forces saw remarkable success. With many of their number struggling in the Rocky Mountains against McNary's government, the unprepared and poorly-trained syndicalist militiamen assigned to defend the hills and valleys of Pennsylvania were quickly cut down by well-trained Canadian soldiers and elite New English mountaineers. Through the network of contacts established by the Second Underground Railroad, thousands of sympathizers to the New English cause rose up wherever they went, sabotaging infrastructure, seizing supply caches, and assassinating syndicalist generals. One by one, Northeastern cities fell to New English arms. First was New York City, the site of those infamous riots in 1937. Next came Pittsburgh, and shortly thereafter Philadelphia. In September 1939, New English troops reached Washington D.C., the former seat of the American government they fought to preserve. As New English troops tore up red banners and cleaned defaced monuments, the damage to the city proved a stark reminder of the horrors of the Second American Civil War. However, it would soon be avenged - in December of 1939, Canadian and New English soldiers reached the outskirts of Chicago. After a bitter, two-month battle, the Stars and Stripes flew once more from the snow-covered ruins of the Chicago Board of Trade Building, marking the collapse of organized syndicalist resistance. The Pacific government was split over whether to peacefully reunify with the New English, with some viewing the Boston-based government as a mere Canadian puppet, but the decision was rapidly made for them as New English mountaineers scaled the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. At long last, on June 1st, 1940, America was finally reunited.

After a snap election, Provisional President of New England and former senator from Rhode Island David I. Walsh was sworn in as the President of the United States. Flags of the provisional government were lowered and replaced with Old Glory, and Congress met once again in the District of Columbia. However, a great weight rested on Walsh's shoulders. America lay in ruins, bearing deep scars from the Second Civil War, and terrorists, syndicalist and Longist alike, wrought havoc on American citizens in an effort to undermine the American government.

https://preview.redd.it/lsi81j8fpnee1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8115ab9d9d81c3cef1338c53f89ca53eb8634fd

Walsh's first actions as President of the United States were to sign a series of executive orders. Walsh limited citizens' access to weapons, banned the SPA and AFP, and created a committee to examine civil rights conditions in the United States in the hopes of finally taking meaningful action against the racist laws, codes, and policies that still governed much of America. However, much of Walsh's agenda would have to wait, as the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg with Russia's invasion of the Reichspakt drew his attention abroad.

Aiding America's Entente allies, American mountaineers scaled the Pyrenees and Alps just as they had the Appalachians in years past. Alongside French, Canadian, Sardinian, Sicilian, Spanish, and Portuguese soldiers, the Commune of France was defeated in under a year, with the Entente-Reichspakt offensives proving too great for their troops to bear. With American help, the French tricolor flew over the City of Light once again.

Ultimately, it was Canada who freed America from the shackles of syndicalism. By forming the Provisional Government of New England and intervening alongside them in the American Civil War, Canada had saved American democracy. In turn, it would in large part be the Americans who freed Britain from Mosley's tyrannical government. Through the combined naval might of the United States and Canada, much of the Red Fleet was sent to its watery grave off the coast of Brittany in the largest naval battle the 20th Century had yet seen. This opened the door to the first successful naval invasion of the British Isles since 1066, which came just outside the city of Cardiff. Supported by shore bombardments from Canadian and American ships, the two's forces poured ashore, massacring the syndicalist defenders. Almost as soon as the beachhead was secured, loyalists across the Union of Britain popped out of the woodwork in a manner eerily similar to those contacts in the Second American Civil War, cutting syndicalist supply lines and sowing chaos behind the front. Entente men and materiel poured into the ports of Cardiff and Bristol, and the death knell was sounded for Mosley's government as a joint Canadian-American offensive finally liberated London, marking an end to the British government's 16-year period of exile. At last, for the Entente, the Second Weltkrieg was over.

Jubilant crowds flooded the streets as newspaper headlines proudly proclaimed the return of the British and French governments. Free elections were once again organized in both for the first time since their exile, leading to the victory of the Conservative Party in the UK and the National Bloc in France.

And at last, Walsh could finally pursue his agenda at home. Aggressive action was taken to fight Jim Crow, with Walsh taking advantage of federal authority to make right the mistakes of the first Reconstruction. Federal troops aggressively put down terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, and segregation was repealed across America. The 1941 Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, and the American government collaborated with unions to ensure better treatment of American workers. At last, American democracy was secure, and though the price was high, a more perfect union was finally achieved.

Their colors were indistinct from afar, their heraldries either hidden or absent as they rode about over the high ground, counting banners, tents, the smoke plumes of fire pits and the horses arrayed outside. It was not long before they were gone. 


By noon, the real army had come.


A large column that stretched far into the unseen distance reached the shores of the Blackwater Rush and, just a few leagues south of the capital, began their crossing of the river. Eight thousand fighting men and many more horses, mules, carriages, carts and a whole other smaller force of porters, servants, attendants, merchants, artisans and an assorted variety of camp followers soon found themselves less than a couple miles west from the walls of King's Landing, raising under its shadow a whole new town of colorful tents and pavillions separated by a network of palisades, banners and latrines. 


Only then were the arms of the houses that composed the army could be seen. The golden rose of the Tyrells was certainly the most prominent, sided by the red hunter of the Tarlys, the leaves on gold from the Oakhearts, the golden tree of the Rowans, the red apple of the Fossoways, the fox and roses of the Florents, cornucopia of the Merryweathers, the ships from the Grimms, the pelicans of the Dunns, all taking center stage. These forces of the Reach were joined by the crimson lion of Castamere, defiant and proud, and last, but not least, the scarlet-red elm over white-and-green of House Redwych stood higher than those of the lesser lords and landed knights that bolstered each of their lieges' forces."

When Melissa from Edioak contacted me via my website's contact form out of the blue, I almost skipped over it, expecting the usual “increase your reach by 300%” pitch. But for some reason (and I still don’t know if it was caffeine or curiosity), I opened it. Next thing I know, I’m filling out a form on [Edioak's House of Pages](https://edioak.com/house-of-pages/) website, thinking, *This could either be the best decision or a paid services scam.*

Cold Email that I received.

Hi Jessie,

Hope you're not buried under a pile of paperbacks! I'm Melissa Smith from Edioak. This year, we've had the pleasure of working with 15 OTT platforms and 18 publishing houses to edit and launch their books, and now we’re looking to expand our author community even further.

We’re inviting you to the “House of Pages,” where authors like you team up, exchange promos, and hit bestseller lists—together, for FREE! It’s like the Avengers but for books.

Curious? Check it out: [https://edioak.com/house-of-pages/](https://edioak.com/house-of-pages/)

Ready to partner up? It costs nothing, just your enthusiasm! The next set of free promotions rolls out from December 14th, 2024—don't miss out!

Cheers,  
Melissa Smith

I submitted my book, social media, and email details, received a friendly “Here’s what you can expect” email, and after a few back-and-forths (seriously, the email ping-pong was real),

I got the news: I was confirmed for House of Pages Batch 7! Fancy, right? I half-expected a Hogwarts-style welcome letter, but I settled for a well-organized, neatly formatted confirmation email. I was officially in, and Edioak had managed to hook me.

**The 250+ Author Surprise: Choose Your Literary Match!**

Fast forward two weeks, and I get an email with a list of over 250 authors signed up for the promotion. Yes, you read that right—250. It was like being handed a guest list for the Met Gala and being told, “Pick one person to spend the evening with.” Talk about pressure! I wasn’t about to go all *Bachelor* and hand out roses, so I picked 4-5 options and shot them over to Edioak, trusting they’d work some matchmaking magic.

https://preview.redd.it/gs5zzy6elmee1.jpg?width=904&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d333145879e6e27345b0d2712e1d27b5724b0d2a

And true to form, Edioak did. Ten days later (right on schedule), they set me up with a fellow author for an email newsletter swap. Now, I’ll be honest—I’ve done “promotion swaps” before that felt like yelling into a void, but this time? Real results. I watched my inbox light up with new subscribers and (drumroll, please) sold a few books too! Yes, actual book sales from a free swap—Edioak wasn’t just talk. I may or may not have done a little happy dance in my chair when those sales notifications came through. It was a free service that actually worked. At that point, I knew this experience deserved a write-up. I mean, how could I not share the magic?

**The Incentives: Edioak’s “Gamified” Author Community**

Just when I thought I’d understood the House of Pages concept, Edioak pulled out a twist: incentives. Yes, this literary promotion marathon came with perks at every mile marker! First, they dangled the chance to pair with one more author if I wrapped up the promo in a week. Fine, I thought, a bit of hustle never hurt anyone.

But wait, there’s more: if my promotions saw actual book sales and newsletter sign-ups (cue happy dance), I’d get to partner with two more authors! And then came the real kicker: if I crushed both promotions and everyone stayed happy, they’d reward me with 50,000 points on [Muted Muses - Muted Muses](http://mutedmuses.com/)—a book community apparently designed for endless reviews. It’s basically like a loyalty program but for literary networking, and I was all in.

And here’s where it got even better: after performing well in all three campaigns, I won $3,000 worth of Goodreads Review Services, two Press Releases, and one Podcast Interview. Now that’s what I call a prize haul! Oh, and as a cherry on top? If I managed to pull off stellar results, Edioak even hinted at tapping into their full range of [Book Marketing Services](https://edioak.com/book-marketing-services/) to help boost visibility further. They clearly knew how to keep an author motivated—and slightly addicted to racking up points.

**Edioak, You Had Me at ""Manual Emails"" (But, Please, Automation?)**

Let’s talk about the only bit of feedback I have: the manual emails. I’m a fan of the personal touch, but after that 8th “Just checking in!” or “Update for you!” email, I started feeling like we were back in 1999, scheduling emails on a family computer. For anyone considering joining House of Pages, brace yourself for a marathon email chain that makes you feel oddly nostalgic. But hey, it’s charming in its own way, and Melissa’s vibe made it worth it.

If I could make one suggestion, though? Automate it, Edioak! Maybe add a “Skip the Queue” button or a magical “Auto-Pilot” mode. That way, I can gush about the experience without recounting each email like chapters in a Victorian novel.

**Final Thoughts: The House of Pages Magic**

So here’s the deal: I joined House of Pages because I was curious, stayed because I saw the potential, and came out the other end a happy author. If you’re looking for a real, no-fluff service that delivers, I can vouch for Edioak. Between the steady flow of emails, the 250+ author list that made me feel like a literary matchmaker, and the authentic vibe from Melissa and her team, it was a journey worth every click.

And that, dear authors, is how I went from a skeptical “cold email” receiver to a full-blown Edioak fan. Here’s to more email swaps, less email chains, a few more book sales—and, hopefully, a touch of automation."

Senator Trevik Valour

“The foundation of galactic progress lies in the steady flow of credits, and the key to prosperity is trust in those who safeguard them.”
Senator Trevik Valour, a distinguished statesman of Muunilinst and leading figure of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, epitomizes the quiet strength of measured leadership. A staunch advocate for fiscal discipline, Valour has dedicated his career to ensuring the stability and growth of the galaxy’s financial infrastructure. Reserved and calculating, he is not one for flamboyance or excessive rhetoric; instead, his approach is marked by prudence, precision, and an unyielding commitment to order.

Valour’s reputation as a master financier and negotiator has elevated him within the Banking Clan, earning him both respect and scrutiny. Though some view his methods as overly conservative, none can deny his effectiveness. Valour firmly believes that financial stability is the key to galactic harmony and that a well-managed economy transcends political divisions.
 breeds decay. Bold risks forge brighter futures. Only by reaching beyond what we know can we create a galaxy worth living in.”

Where Senator Trevik Valour is a reserved pillar of fiscal caution, Junior Representative Kyvin Morath is a storm of unbridled ambition and daring. A young and charismatic Muun from a lesser family, Morath rose through the ranks of the InterGalactic Banking Clan with a reputation for fearless innovation and risk-taking. Where Valour sees stability as the bedrock of prosperity, Morath believes that bold moves and aggressive investments are the keys to unlocking the galaxy’s potential.

Morath is vibrant and persuasive, often stealing the spotlight from his mentor during public appearances. His energy and charm captivate those who believe the Banking Clan must modernize to remain relevant in an increasingly chaotic galaxy. He has a flair for showmanship and isn’t above using his sharp wit to challenge Valour’s cautious approach, though he never steps so far as to disrespect the elder statesman outright.

Muunilinst

Muunilinst, the shimmering crown jewel of the financial galaxy, serves as the beating heart of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. Its pristine spires rise above verdant landscapes, blending natural beauty with the austere elegance of financial institutions. The planet is a global banking hub, housing countless financial districts, data repositories, and investment firms that manage credits flowing across the galaxy.

Major Imports

1. Processed Foods: With its economy heavily reliant on financial services rather than agriculture, Muunilinst imports vast quantities of processed and packaged foods to sustain its workforce and maintain efficiency.

2. Consumer Goods: The affluent elite of Muunilinst demand high-quality goods and luxury items to complement their refined lifestyles, while the middle class consumes mass-market products.

Major Exports

Precious Metals: Muunilinst is a primary exporter of refined precious metals, such as gold, platinum, and iridium, mined from its rich deposits. These metals are integral to manufacturing, commerce, and technology across the galaxy.


	 Plans and Vision for the Future


Under Senator Valour’s stewardship, the InterGalactic Banking Clan is pursuing an ambitious and transformative agenda:


1. Galactic Financial Harmonization: Standardizing currencies and exchange rates to streamline interplanetary commerce and reduce economic friction.

2. Debt Optimization: Expanding the availability of low-interest loans for developing systems while implementing new methods to ensure repayment through resource-based contracts and trade agreements.


3. Resource Acquisition and Monetization: Increasing the Clan’s holdings of precious metals, planets with valuable mining resources, and long-term asset control in developing systems.


4. Fortified Financial Networks: Investing in cyber-resilient infrastructure to secure the galaxy’s financial systems from technological threats and unauthorized interference.


5. Privatization of Public Assets: Advocating for the transition of key planetary resources and industries into private control under the guidance of the Banking Clan, ensuring efficiency and profit.


6. Credit-Based Employment System: Introducing a structured economic model where employment contracts are tied directly to credit obligations, ensuring functionalist alignment and consistent economic participation.


6. Pioneering Trade Expansion: Establishing financial routes and agreements with outer systems to bring untapped resources and labor into the galactic economy.

Looking Ahead

The InterGalactic Banking Clan, under Senator Trevik Valour, stands poised to redefine the galaxy’s financial future. By prioritizing stability, expanding resource holdings, and fortifying interplanetary financial infrastructure, the Clan will ensure that no system is left behind in the march toward economic prosperity. Through meticulous management, strategic investment, and a commitment to harmony, the Banking Clan will usher in a new age of unparalleled growth—an era where credits, and the stability they bring, unite the galaxy.

“The future is secure because the Banking Clan ensures it.”

10. On December 3, the very day martial law was declared, Kyrgyzstani President Sadyr Japarov visited Yongsan.

11. Kyrgyzstan had also faced turmoil over election fraud in 2020.

12. Before Japarov, the newly elected president was Jeenbekov, who openly pursued pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies.

13. By introducing a joint currency with Russia, the nation’s economy ended up dependent on Russia.

14. After borrowing 600 million yuan from China, Kyrgyzstan surrendered mining resource licenses to China.

15. As a result, Kyrgyz citizens were unable to choose the most vital interests or preserve their sovereignty.

16. The public had been biding its time, eager to bring down the regime through the October 5, 2020 parliamentary elections.

17. Yet the results gave pro-Russian, pro-Chinese forces under Jeenbekov a monopoly of 107 out of 120 seats.

18. When the outcome was announced in the afternoon, enraged teenagers and people in their twenties poured into Ala-Too Square.

19. The students demanded the annulment of the election and a new vote.

20. Images of the protesters spread rapidly on social media, and by evening thousands had gathered.

21. President Jeenbekov mobilized force to break up the crowd before it could grow further.

22. They shut off the streetlights and used water cannons, tear gas, and stun grenades for a violent crackdown.

23. Protesters were beaten with batons, left covered in blood.

24. When the streetlights came back on, people witnessed the scene.

25. It was utter chaos—an asurajang (“scene of pandemonium”)—yet in the midst of it all, one student lay collapsed.

26. Nineteen-year-old Umutbek had lost both legs to a stun grenade explosion and was found dead.

27. Images of the young man’s brutal death spread across social media.

28. Outraged citizens, seeing this, flooded the streets.

29. Believing the police to be fellow citizens, they had hoped to find solidarity with them.

30. In Kyrgyzstan, policing was considered a stable, even marriage-prospective career.

31. Yet strangely, the police exercised violence without hesitation, heedless of the bloodshed.

32. Most officers were of northern Russian descent or ethnic Chinese.

33. The root cause lay in excessive admissions and hiring advantages given to remnants of Soviet forces and Chinese communities.

34. Not only in police recruitment but in multiple paths to social prestige, doors were thrown wide open for them.

35. They could enroll in Kyrgyz National Medical University, Ala-Too Medical University, and Bishkek Medical University via special admission.

36. One of Bishkek’s top seven law schools also offered special admission for them.

37. Even without the necessary grades, large numbers were admitted under the guise of preventing discrimination against minorities.

38. Entry into a good university led to landing a good job.

39. In Kyrgyzstan, policing was a gateway to upper-class aspirations.

40. In order to protect their own benefits and privileges, these minority groups violently suppressed the protesters.

41. By the night of October 5, about 600 people had been injured or killed.

42. The more the protesters were oppressed, the more fervently they rose up, firm in their beliefs.

43. From the French Revolution, the Prague Spring, Tiananmen, to the April 19 Revolution—history has repeatedly proven this truth.

44. On that day, full of rage and determination, Kyrgyz citizens could not sleep.

45. At dawn on October 6, out of Bishkek’s population of 1 million, 700,000 poured onto the streets.

46. Men and women of all ages united in a single voice, condemning the fraudulent election.

47. Thousands of Kyrgyz men locked arms in scrums, blocking police access.

48. Even those blinded by exploding stun grenades did not let go.

49. Braving water cannons and tear gas, they held firm in their resolve to resist.

50. Despite the violent suppression, citizens continued peacefully, protecting one another.

51. They formed a citizens’ patrol, “Druzhiniki,” to keep an eye on any violence that might erupt from the protests.

52. By day, protesters occupied the Central Election Commission, demanding the nullification of the election through popular resistance.

53. By evening, they stormed the detention center and freed Japarov (the current president), who had been unlawfully arrested.

54. President Jeenbekov denounced this as a coup, declared a state of emergency, and moved to crack down harshly.

55. The citizens, despite indiscriminate police brutality, persisted in non-violent protests.

56. Once casualties passed a thousand, some protesters began using violence themselves, setting police cars on fire.

57. Russian- and Chinese-descended senior officers in the police wanted to fire live rounds at the crowd.

58. The protesters advanced to the presidential office, but Jeenbekov refused to give the order to shoot.

59. Nationwide, 4.1 million people—out of a total population of 7.3 million—took to the streets.

60. Six days after declaring a state of emergency, Jeenbekov caved to intense public pressure and resigned.

61. Kyrgyzstan succeeded in reversing the fraudulent election and reclaiming democracy.

62. South Korea’s situation is somewhat different.

63. Before the Kim Dae-jung administration, of the 600,000 ethnic Chinese living in Korea, 51.5% ran Chinese restaurants.

64. Under Park Chung-hee’s anti-Chinese policies, opening a Chinese restaurant required a permit rather than a simple registration.

65. For these ethnic Chinese, passing down a restaurant with a valid permit was both tradition and livelihood.

66. In 2003, Kim Dae-jung lifted many of the restrictions on ethnic Chinese and granted them voting rights.

67. The law was revised so that they could become public servants, and exemption from military service was legalized.

68. Special admission pathways were introduced under the justification of reducing discrimination against ethnic Chinese.

69. Citing computerization, the lists of successful college applicants were no longer disclosed, hiding the Chinese names.

70. Ethnic Chinese children gained special admission to medical, pharmacy, Korean medicine, and veterinary programs with CSAT scores around the 3rd–4th tier.

71. At the time, only 1.7% of Chinese residents worked in medical or pharmaceutical fields, but by 2023 that figure had risen to 27.7%.

72. Meanwhile, the share of Chinese restaurants fell from 51.5% to 22.4% by 2023.

73. In other words, instead of inheriting family restaurants, most Chinese children became doctors, pharmacists, Korean medicine practitioners, or veterinarians.

74. This explains why there are so many female pharmacists who speak with a Joseonjok accent or have the Chinese character “령” in their names.

75. Not only in medicine and pharmacy but in various other fields, ethnic Chinese in Korea have expanded their presence.

76. They have a strong grip on entertainment, the media, politics, the judiciary, the legislature, and even elections.

77. Identifying more with the overseas Chinese community than with their birth country, they place economic profit above patriotism.

78. Their belief is that only economic power can protect them.

79. Their survival strategies parallel those of Jews who historically had no homeland.

80. Traditionally, the Chinese diaspora does not hesitate to engage in any activity that turns a profit.

81. Typically, the expansion of ethnic Chinese communities is categorized into six stages.

82. Stage 1 involves making a living through restaurants, retail, and other market activities (Park Chung-hee’s Fourth Republic).

83. Stage 2 is lending money to fellow Chinese at high interest, a private finance operation funded by market profits (Malaysia).

84. Stage 3 is building a Chinese network to amass major wealth via import-export trade and banking (Singapore).

85. Stage 4 is lobbying media and political circles to gradually roll back regulations (Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia).

86. Stage 5 is partnering with the political sphere for real estate development, becoming large-scale capitalists (the Philippines, Thailand).

87. Stage 6 is wielding influence across the economy, politics, and culture, using division and control (South Korea).

88. Chinese capitalists lobby politicians to secure quiet privileges for their children.

89. As a result, these children can ascend rapidly into elite positions through preferential college admissions and hiring.

90. They easily make it into SKY universities, “In-Seoul” universities, or the Korea National University of Arts, then proceed to conglomerates, civil service, broadcasting, or journalism.

91. Once they climb to key positions, they engage in anti-state activities.

92. Meanwhile, those who do inherit Chinese restaurants spend much of their day steering online opinion through comments in community forums.

93. Whether they are wealthy or working-class, young or old, the common goal is to foment divisions in South Korea.

94. The more fractured South Korea becomes, the stronger the Chinese diaspora grows.

95. Planting Chinese diaspora members everywhere makes it easy to keep driving the country toward internal division.

96. The central force behind division in the Republic of Korea is the ethnic Chinese diaspora.

97. We must question everything for which no transparent list exists.

98. It’s difficult to know how far their influence stretches and what powers they hold.

99. Speaking Gyeongsang or Jeolla dialects, they are fully assimilated into Korean society.

100. Across political lines, the establishment has laid the groundwork for the Chinese diaspora to manipulate the nation.

101. This is the outcome of deliberate political engineering.

102. It’s a symbiotic relationship between the Chinese diaspora, who seek division, and factions that deny Korea’s national identity.

103. They undermine the legitimacy of the country’s founding day and label the current regime “pro-Japanese,” rejecting the nation’s identity.

104. Some are driven by Sinocentrism, believing they once ruled Korea and may rule it again someday.

105. Because dismantling Korea from within produces far more catastrophic outcomes, these groups feed off each other.

106. Politics and the media, in particular, function as the most powerful tools in promoting division within South Korea.

107. The covert privileges and social success of the Chinese diaspora represent more than just individual achievement.

108. It is a structural problem undermining Korea’s stability and progress.

109. Already, extreme suicide and low birthrates are proceeding according to plan.

110. On December 3, the day martial law was declared, Yoon Seok-yeol invited the President of Kyrgyzstan to Seoul.

111. This was Japarov, the same man who had gone from jail to the presidency.

112. Yoon met one-on-one with Japarov, who had faced a situation much like the one Yoon was preparing for.

113. Perhaps he wanted a small measure of comfort before staking his life on martial law.

114. For Yoon, martial law was the final measure to protect the Republic of Korea.

115. He was keenly aware that a united people is an absolute power that cannot be broken by authority or force.

116. He believed that under any crisis, the citizens of Korea would still choose justice and freedom.

117. Seeing that Kyrgyzstan’s people had done it, he believed South Koreans could do the same.

118. Some might recall glimpsing impeachment banners hung around the city even before martial law was enacted.

119. Still, they might have thought, “We elected him, so maybe he’s doing all right—one way or another.”

120. After passing those crosswalks where the impeachment banners fluttered, people went back to their daily lives.

121. In a private meeting, the Kyrgyzstani president said to Yoon Seok-yeol:

122. “President Yoon, trust the people—give it a try.”

123. On December 2, at the Gongju Market radio booth, President Yoon suddenly decided he wanted to offer an unscheduled greeting.

124. Glancing into the booth where the market crowd was watching, he extended a New Year’s greeting.

125. At this slightly early holiday wish, people looked at one another and smiled.

126. Then, Yoon Seok-yeol spoke.

127. “All of you trust me, don’t you?”"
"To whoever this may interest, give me your thoughts. An unfinished story of harried travellers seeking a fabled cave.",creativewriting,1i7k1rz,2025-01-22 14:47:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i7k1rz/to_whoever_this_may_interest_give_me_your/,According_Promise_89,Short Story,"Under an Orange sky a company of ragged men sat equally pensive, motionless and silent around a small fire stoked with discarded possessions they had all personally forsaken as had they renounced all hopes of returning to their homes. The image of a warm bed and the touch of a woman they had finally ceased to toy with in their mind, as they now realised it was merely a transient comfort and a hindrance to their acceptance of their true grim reality. The great sun had begun to lick the western horizon as it shimmered in the rising heat that now diminished in the darkening landscape. The only sound that could be heard in the close walled gorge was the crackle of the pathetic few flamed fire which reached their ears but failed to enter their minds, imprisoned by numb despair. Some smoked for fleeting stimulation as tobacco was among the few commodities they had left of their once promising inventory. Sleep deprived for days they knew the enemy was always half a day behind on their trail, and they could not afford to rest unless they wished to have their throats slit in their sleep which by now seemed a most pleasant demise. The only man that still wore a hat was the captain of the fellowship and despite his proficiency in this grim way of living his hopes had too began to dwindle. He, the oldest of the men by at least 20 years now was tormented by guilt for leading these inept young minds on a fruitless punishing endeavour exploiting their impressionability and his keen ability to orate to aid him on a selfish pursuit, he himself unsure of what he truly pursued.

They started from a town 40 miles east and of their inventory they had 5 great steeds and 3 mules to carry their provender and ammunition, of which they now had none. One man, the youngest of the group, had nothing to offer as fuel for the fire. His final set of clothes torn and black with filth. The raiment he bore as they set out on their journey stolen by a pack of vicious creatures in the night, which now served as warmth for their offspring that grew accustomed to the smell of that man until it eventually faded and was forgotten, not that they had any ability to consider it more than a scent.

By and by, without words they all seemed to concur on resigning and turning in under the rising yellow moon as dreams began to take them. One revery, the image of a blue eyed woman who’s penetrating gaze yielded before him as he beheld her seemed like a suitable final thought to cling to and be devoured by until he joined her in dream and then in afterlife. One by one each harried soul began to drift into weary sleep and each dream that called to them became distorted and feverish and they all awoke but 3 hours later feeling just as weary as they had before. The captain stirred first and had already begun to gather himself and prepare to continue their journey. The moon had only just fully risen.

They set out continuing through the gorge all on bruised feet and swollen ankles, the only other creature left in the company a small withered mule which bore empty rifles and the rest of their food. By now all had begun to resent the captain but no more than their own fickle minds that allowed them to be persuaded on such a frivolous endeavour, their destination a cave on the lonely peak some 30 miles further which allegedly housed a treasure of magnetite. This the captain heard while drunk in some dirty tavern from a fellow sot, unbeknownst to the rest of the company as he had described it as a solid piece of information from an exalted prospector he had known throughout his career who had previously given him similar information that led him on successful past travels with other companies. These companies composed of similar young souls that had all been mutilated by the foe, the captain a cowardly renegade that every time fled to leave his fellows to the unforgiving savages that danced in their gore with such passion that they would overlook the fleeing of one man.

His seasoned aura was certainly constituted by his naked appearance, to some degree. His withered wrinkled cheeks and overhung brows gained from decades of affliction and living out of a saddlebag. But his clothing was the most significant component of his image that reassured the young men of his skill and ardour. He wore a long brownish oilcloth slicker and a wide brimmed hat with a yellow and pink crane feather in the pleated leather that ran the circumference of the base of the hat. An artificial taste of clothing, even the feather was a prop piece that he stole out of the back of a circus wagon. Always clenched between his striking teeth was a long smooth mahogany pipe with a polished ivory mouth piece. Before he had assembled this crew of clueless children he had surmised upon this addition to his effigy spontaneously and picked it up from a tobacco shop now brandished it like it had been with him since the start of his gumptious and perilous career. All was cunning and fraudulent, and only by that meagre campfire, faced with his own certain death he had finally started to consider his sociopathic imprudence that had costed the lives of so many of these men. But as soon as they started off back on track to the alleged fairytale cave he had entirely forgotten his broodings and had again returned to the manipulation of his subordinate and dispensable followers.

After a long cumbersome schlep over wet and rocky terrain the company reached an incline which allowed them to exit the narrow gorge, the captain of course ascended first with one hand held palm first behind him wordlessly commanding his followers to sit tight while he surveyed the immediate land. Jack and Nemo exchanged glances of reverent anticipation watching in awe their courageous leader. The incline gradually got steeper until it eventually became a 3 foot tall wall which arose the dilemma of either the relinquishment of their beast or to continue on the narrow path which got narrower yet. The captain placed both hands on the grassy top and peered over for about 5 seconds thoroughly examining the surroundings, muttering to himself and nodding his head subtly as if hatching a plan of attack to shortly be briefed to the men. He promptly turned and, heading down the damp moss covered rocky gradient his barely broken in boots failed him spectacularly and the solid heel failed to purchase the rock and he slipped and landed on his back and slid down back into the ravine, kicking his little feet in empty attempts to subdue his embarrassing slip. He only gained speed and landed at the mules feet, scattering some pebbles with his backside. He gave no groan but only looked at the ground with the brim of his hat veiling his bashful features and remained there for a moment. No member of the fellowship dared look at him as they had seen how much this mans pride meant to him, and those that did quailed under his eye when he looked up furtively to somehow reassure himself that maybe not the whole company had watched his fall in its entirety. He pushed him self up and blew some hair out of his eyes and looked at each member carefully. “Men. The foe has overtaken us . Either they are now completely aware of our whereabouts, and have already began to contrive camps along these edges in preparation for an arrow ambush, or they have completely missed our tracks and have moved on”. These tidings dropped each mans heart into his bowels. They began to look at one another with the same expression and the ubiquity of their fear amplified their panic. “How come you by that conclusion Capt” said Reggie, an average height fat boy with a childish physiognomy. He was resented by the majority of the men and established as a know-it-all and the only one that ever dared question the Captain. The Captain looked at him solemnly for 10 measured seconds and raised his index finger slowly and pointed it at the top of the incline, signalling whoever had the sand to peer over and see for themselves.

The first man to surmount his loathing was the fat boy, a display of courage with the soul intention of refining his reputation in the company and to tickle the captain so that he would look upon his special apprentice with pride and the others with disdain. Not a soul among them failed to see through this transparent attempt at gaining respect. His fat little legs in their baggy breaches trudged up the ramp slipping but not enough to send him flying back down the slippery stoney slope. When he reached the top the men were muttering and scoffing amongst themselves furtively shaking their heads in doubt of him routing for any opportunity to laugh and point in the case of him tumbling back down and landing before their rotten feet. Reg saw that they had now entered a thick coniferous wood and when he gripped the turf level with his chest pine needles pricked his fingers and palms. There was a wide clearing with the ground thoroughly scraped away and a large fire pit in the centre with pieces of bone and flesh laying scattered and consumed around it. The fire pit still produced smoke telling of the foes recent passing and the size and swiftness of the camps construction told of a large throng of their enemy only passing and stopping to eat their killings hunted with arrow and lance displayed by broken arrow shafts and scavenged stones used in the sharpening of their blades. The bits of leftover meat stuck to the bones were still ruddy and fresh, further establish the recency of their passage and the gangs eagerness to continue their hunt for men. Reggy adjusted his hat and sniffed his snotty nose while doing so and ,hiding his dread and yearning for his mother he started back down the slope with extra care so as not to sully his newly earned respect for this courageous series of astute observations which he would delicately confer with the Captain in front of his clueless peers who would now look up to him as a secondary to the chief. After him being promptly ignored by the Captain, who had already concluded to the men that they were to continue through the ravine, they started once again through its sharp narrow walls. No words were spoken, only fleeting thoughts of how they would be hung and flayed by the enemy waiting for them at the end of this linear path which would deliver them straight to their horrible doom. They carried on.

 

 

 

Chapter 2

At around sunrise, in some nearby hollow lined with thick pine thickets, not a furlong from the gorge, the heavy patter of horses sauntering was dampened by the tight packed trunks and soft mossy floor. The forest stole away the sound and absorbed it in her trees. The riders were stout swarthy crude looking creatures, they communicated in clicks of the tongue and grunts, and the chief, who rode at the front, clad in feathers and rawhide, commanded them with hand signals. They were a scout group, sent from the main fleet who were stationed on the other side of the forest. Their horses were painted bright and ruddy colours contrived of dye and blood and ash, and were great, brutish creatures. They had no knowledge of the ravine, and had no business with the camp nearby, which too they had no knowledge of. The wood was so dense that it was impossible to descry these, and all they followed were horse tracks in the ruptured moss tufts and were beginning to deviate their focuses on pursuit and more on food. The air was dank and the bright rays of the early sunshine illuminated clouds of mushroom pores, which were sucked up into the nostrils of the beasts and men and tickled their throats and made them splutter and choke. The hollow was speckled with red and brown mushrooms and toads loped between their stipes, keeping to their own queer enterprises and conferring in speculation to the fierce forayers. One warrior had 2 headless amphibians in his grasp, gnawing at them raw jollily as he undulated on the horse which struggled over the uneven terrain. They wobbled on until the chief stopped at the beginning of a slight incline and held up his fist and the men halted and listened. A light rustling could be heard on the top of the hollow on their left and the group readied their arrows in anticipation of the doomed critter.

A nimble roe buck elegantly leaped over the hollow intending to reach the other side, it flew with pride and caught the sunlight like a spirit of the greenwood, only to meet an onslaught of arrows which destroyed its trajectory. It fell violently down into the hollow and writhed and wept until a small warrior jumped off his horse and scuttled down with a crude dagger, and slit its throat to end the poor beasts suffering. The hide was ruined by the carpet of arrows in the beasts side, and they were removed and the buck was flung over and tied to the back of one of the horses. At this victory they continued on up the incline and reached level ground. The sunlight ceased as it now failed on the wall of evergreens, and the height and density of this wood could now fully be beheld. From here the tracks ran dry and the men hunkered down and that same small warrior began to prepare the kill with that same dagger. Some undertook to build a fire and spit and the chief began to unpack his saddlebag crafted from the full degloved hide of a small pig, and laid out an diverse array of discarded possibles and trinkets and items of nature dissonant to them. He carefully examined them and smelled and licked them and to be viewed doing this he would look like a primal being on a frivolous task or a child with toys. He was merely amusing himself and could not discern any real purpose for this as his acumen was solely proficient to hunting and tracking and he was unable to consider other dimensions though he tried. They stumbled about mechanically carrying out their business with no thought or further consideration.

 

The men in the gorge, now 6 hours later, were still stumbling through the rocks and still dreading whatever waited for them. Not much had been spoken since the finding of the camp, but many thoughts had been thought. Some men grew to concurringly despise each other through nothing but individual revery. Some strange delirium lay on the crew as their thoughts seeped into each others minds and the contours of conscience had decayed. It was a heavy impression that lay on them all but the Captain, they were unable to read him like they could themselves, as each man had been broken by thought only. It grew so dark and so did their delirium, and conversations ran through their minds that they presumed to be between them and a peer when indeed it was in their mind. Each man suffered this as voices rang in all of their heads and here and there men would mutter words or bits of sentences with no beginning or end. This of course made the captain anxious of their growing volume, but as the light began to grow again, their strange impressions, influenced by the perfidious darkness of the lower layers of the forest floor, started to lift. They stopped for a brief rest which alerted them to the growing pain in their feet and legs. They began to converse trivially in an attempt to sustain morale but their chatters were cut short by a start from the Captain. They heard a clamour rising above them and the flame of hope in each mans heart was extinguished and they all braced for an inevitable onslaught of arrows and gore by laying prostrate on the rocks with hands clasped behind their heads. They covered themselves in rocks and wet growth in feeble attempts for camouflage. The clamour rose and rose until it was easily to be discerned as a battle. A band in pursuit and scattering through the trees squealing, bleeding and afflicted, their numbers dwindling. They passed along the forest floor along the ravine in the direction of the groups coming and what followed was a sinister silence. As the frightened renegades disappeared from hearing now the heavy trotting of hoof and panting of horse filled the quiet air. Tongue clicking was heard and a rolling whistle sharp and fierce rang against the walls of the gorge. A large wet mass came tumbling down the precipice and struck either side of the wall painting the rocky protrusions crimson and entrails hung from their jagged edges. It crashed down amongst the men and created a cloud of gravel and dust which had a pink pearlescence and one man peered from between his fingers to examine the mass of flesh. It was hard to decipher his features as they had been maimed and mutilated and his body lacked arm or leg. A torso slashed and bludgeoned, his head misshapen with a shattered jaw hewn crudely tethered by remnants of sinew. His burst eyes bleeding and agape stared back at the man with the expression of one frozen in pain as if his spirit lay awake in agony, failing to escape this realm of existence under an insidious curse and imprisoned in some dark corner of his dying brain which was exposed on the back of his naked broken skull under a flensed scalp. A gripping chill took the witness and overcame his spine and trickled up his neck until his heart began to flutter and scream and panic devoured him. All lay quiet except the trickling of blood into the thin spring which carried the victim’s essence on to be absorbed and fed upon by the organisms of the forest. An assortment of discarded limbs and bits of flesh were now flung down the ravine resulting in a foray of blood and gore which dirtied the men as they lay motionless. The last token of victory was sacrificed to the forest mother who accepted the savage legions provender in her cleft of the forsaken. A small dog still yelping flung down the dark gorge which landed broken on a mans back now laden with gore. The band of barbarians moved on and all was silent in the ravine except for the mutt’s diminishing squeals. The man whose back it struck snapped its neck compassionately and sat up caressing it quietly sobbing in a puddle of congealed red which mixed with dust and became a strange clay now forever woven to the company’s raiment. They sat in silent horror and the light seemed to be snatched from the rocky bed as the light was absorbed by the rock blackened with blood. All fell to brooding except the captain who sat against the wall scrutinising a bloodied parchment illuminating it with his pipe and scowling with each draw. ‘About an hour or so more and we’ll be out of this accursed gorge’, he brushed a tenderised piece of meat from off his lap and cursed the sullying of his apparel, and he made a prompt start onto his feet to initiate their departure but the men sat indifferent to his stirrings and continued to brood and despair. The captain turned and saw the mule, motionless on its side, dead. He stumbled over man and limb with care and went to examine the poor beast. It has become apparent that a discarded leg had dislodged a slate in the wall which had fell unbeknownst to the men as its landing had been supressed by the unfortunate donkeys neck. It lay protruding from behind its ears and had severed the spinal column. The donkey lay with dark eyes empty and emotionless, its tongue lay among the stones dirtied with blood and dust grasped between its teeth. ‘The last of our beasts has perished in the foray gentlemen. Can I ask a volunteer to help me unpack the wallets so we can continue on’. Reggy, now rose and standing with a darkened face covered in bloody clay stepped over the hacked arms and tarnished souls that sat black in the shadow, their legs in baskets and their arms flaccid beside them, their mouths agape and their minds taken by torment. Reg and the Captain began to unbuckle the saddle and took out bits of flint and primers and remnants of food now rotten and spoiled with gore. Apples half eaten, their flesh once white and now brown wrought with blood. Most of the inventory was discarded but ammunition was looted from what pockets they could find on the carcasses which bore clothing akin to the men which troubled them. The poor refugees mirror images of the men, who suffered a demise which awaited them surely. The finding of ammunition rekindled their hopes only slightly but not all hope was lost. They started on through the dark gorge and emerged but an hour later into the dull light like a nightmare fleet. A band of hell spawn coughed up by some forgotten cleft deep in the ravine, who danced in the gore of their victims, dark red and misshapen with cakes of red clay moulded in their hair and their tattered clothes covered in flesh which reeked and festered. They limped like servants of an ancient evil, mindless and suffering but bent on completing their undertakings.

 

On their great sturdy steeds the savages had picked up a trail, gentle little bare footprints and discarded fungal caps and stalks, that of a foraging party, who resided in a dell in huts crafted from moss and stone. An innocent people, exempt from the feuds of the contemporary cultures, only this band of warriors was composed of doggish reprobates. Their moral and religious principles had no foundation as their god was dead and their homes and families pillaged and raped by the sholes of foreigners on their imperialistic slaughters. Any creature that stood on 2 legs and had a shade of skin different to theirs was murdered regardless. As they followed the trail they heard the group, humming gently and politely whistling so as to not disrupt the peace of the great forest, and descried them amongst the briar and grass picking scarlet waxcaps and brown boletes. They were 18 in number. The warriors were 14. They descended upon them in a gruesome chorus of whistles and wails and hacked at their lifeless bodies in a frenzied rage. Some scattered and ran along the line of the ravine which could be jumped over, but none dared as it was forbidden by their secret religion. The riders dismounted and unsheathed even nastier cleavers and pursued them while jeering and snorting and some even chased on all fours. The radius of the commotion failed to exceed eye view which was reduced by the thick wood. The group in the gorge faint souls listening to this slaughter in horror, in some other layer of the earth, like distant spirits tethered back to reality by the unholiness of this onslaught. One forager went renegade and forsook his ancient principles, leaping over the ravine but failing the jump, he disappeared into the gorge never to be remembered or beheld by any living soul again. Once the little people were destroyed they were so hacked that their limbs lay scattered, due to the sharpness of those cleavers which were scraped against wet rocks whenever the tribe rested. To encounter a fully prepared camp occupied by these savages, you would hear nothing but the scraping of metal like some gruesome slaughterhouse, and you would see an array of black figures clothed in rawhide and teeth and organic token, crouching and circled around a fine fire, glowing in the flickering light and the many folds of their ragged faces placing shadows on them that refined their brutish look. Their hair flowing into a pile before them, all uniformly scraping at their blades or gnashing at raw flesh. The dead were scalped and the scalps were pierced and hung along a piece of string woven from dried deciduous leaves, foliage that cannot be found in the breed of tree that governed the immense forest. Of the remains, butchered and bludgeoned, they were flung into the shadowy crack which carried the souls down to oblivion.

Chapter 3

The captains group had emerged from the ravine upon a wooded decline that ascended behind them, the ravine, more like a tunnel leading up to the exit, had cut its way through a lonely hill that separated them somewhat from the many bands creeping around. Man or beast, all was hostile, and every hungry creature could smell the party who were now completely beat by their weariness. They hunkered down in a hollow in some neck of the woods were they trees were so thick that their width was greater than a prostrate man, his arms extended before him. And their height, could simply not be reckoned, as the great ancient trunks disappeared into the canopy which appeared as a roof which blocked most light, except for meagre sun rays here and there, which were danced in by little flowers which were so few. The forest floor was brown and all was covered in a carpet of dead pine needles. In this hollow shielded by the organic walls the men fell deep into slumber and reeked and reeked until all eyes in the forest surrounded them but no pack of creatures dared to assail them for they looked a fierce and ugly company. The sun had started to set and the forest grew thicker and darker, and what lurked was left to imagination and tale. They had no fire, but some who awoke smoked and talked of archaic horrors that prowled these old growth regions, restoring the continuity of the land by swallowing travellers whole and leaving no trace. Their hopes were growing again and those that smoked resigned their chatter and fell back into peaceful sleep. One man rose when all were asleep, Jack while deep in feverish dream had dreamt of an angelic voice which called to him and beckoned him deeper into the trees. A beautiful woman voluptuous and clad in white silk, whose strawberry hair lay about his face and he was lost in her locks. He awoke compelled by a strange lust and although the voice materialised in the distant planes of his mind, it called to him still. He furtively scrambled out of the hollow and wandered off, his eyes dark and his lustful desire insatiable. He was never seen by the men again. This aberration was ascribed to delirium and they buried his possessions in a half-hearted sombre ceremony, as none volunteered to locate the missing fellow. None dared to question the nature of his disappearance, the man had been taken as a sacrifice by the forest mother and entombed in her soil, a wondrous tale worthy of reverence, his soul pure and selected by the forest to serve in its preservation. He had been snatched away by a pack of wolves, and his remains were picked at by wood doves and they stole away locks of his hair in which their broods nestled and stirred in innocent dream. When the fellowship commenced their departure they were rested but their stomachs squelched and demanded sustenance. The Captain was immersed in his bloodied map and took bearings with his compass which was attached to his belt by a pleated leather lanyard. They left the hollow and continued north east through the jail bars of dead and dry branches malnourished of sunlight in that dark place. They encountered a slaughtered dear killed by beast and took turns with their blades harvesting modicums of flesh which they greedily emptied into their rotten gobs. Their clothes now were now black, and still damp they bore a horrible stench which could be smelled by any nearby living thing. Some men had adopted the task of foraging amanita muscaria mushrooms which they stashed in their saddle bags, their knowledge of mushrooms non existent. They trudged on now scratched and cut by the knobbly branches, worrying of the foreign blood stained on their heads contaminating their small wounds and causing infection. The Captain noticed the mushroom foraging and said nothing but chuckled to himself knowing of what was to come of those men. These mushrooms were extremely potent and these men were doomed to a night of madness and religious revelation. Their task for today was to gather food and the captain with authoritative posture, hands clasped behind him walked on as they attacked each thing that loped across their path. After 3 hours of walking they had accumulated 3 rabbits and even a small badger who, nocturnal, had left her residence and cubs to perform reconnaissance on the local disturbance. These cubs were left with enough food to flourish and became strong sons who attacked travellers in passage with vengeance. Once the sun had started to creep through the cracks in the forest roof the men hunkered down in a clearing and built a small fire on which they cooked their killings and the proud foraging men boiled their mushroom stew. The Captain waited with anticipation while he picked the tender brown meat from the thigh of a rabbit, salted and succulent. The men waited eagerly with their wooden bowls and tapped them with their spoons licking their teeth. Some out of pride for their novel undertaking had passed on rabbit or badger and wished only to taste their stew with a fresh appetite. Every man tasted that stew bar the Captain. After an hour of quiet rabble and the smacking of gobs each man was fed and content. Nemo, the leader of this new found discipline of adventurous culinary endeavour, sat silent staring up at the trees. His eyes were wide and his mouth near touched the bowl between his knees. ‘Men, do you not see it?’. The conversation which had now found the topic of past sexual escapades ceased and each man turned his head to Nemo. ‘See what young Nemo sir?’, enquired the Captain who had been carefully waiting to ask this exact question to first victim of the hallucinogenic. Hey was grinning and sitting forward and the men noticed his keenness and mischievous look, and all sat hooked to Nemo’s strange demeanour. ‘She breathes and shimmers, the trees are alive and they are all watching us in disdainful scrutiny, laughing to each other’. The company stirred and looked up, all except the captain who continued to watch Nemo as the psychedelic continued to take him. They saw nothing and laughed and poked fun at young Nemo, his mind the youngest and most susceptible to aberrations in cognitive ability. ‘Well aint that the shits and giggles’, some said. ‘That’s some religious revery if I ever seen it, Nemo’s officially lost it folks’. But gradually each man started to feel some strange impression taking him. Some heard  whispers coming from the trees, some watched as little tiny figures emerged from the moss and scuttled about on their strange errands, stealing bits of flower petals and wrestling with them. They were all awestruck and panic began to creep into their minds, amplified by the hallucinogen. Some men who were weak of mind saw horrible images of limbs and heads, belonging to those dear to them, hanging from the menacing boughs which loomed over them, looking upon them with disdain. These men were the first to attempt strip their bloodied clothes off, scratching at their heads and writhing and shouting and kicking their legs. The Captain watched and chuckled while huffing on his pipe and consuming the rest of the rabbit. They were so heavily influenced by this chemical that they were unable to run or escape the horrors which danced in terrible turmoil in their vision and they were unable to look away or surmount it. Nemo crawled away into some bush and vomited his guts up and lay there in profound day dream, he was convulsing and euphoria surged within him and he became convinced he was some deity from the skies sent on a mission to alter the course of history entirely. By and by the patterns and bucolic landscapes which passed through his mind began to lift and he beheld an old withered mushroom there before him amongst the moss. It had a ragged old face and a long white beard, and the brows which hung over its eyes gently lifted and revealed bright lime green eyes which looked back at him. ‘We are an ancient civilisation, a vast network which sees all. We span the forest and govern her floor and we are older than man and beast. I, like others, are the fruit of the network. Her eyes, we watched these forests grow and we raised their saplings and offered them council and you and your band of menaces have been seen by the forest, pulling her fruit out of the ground and revelling in your madness. Your numbers will dwindle, your men will be taken by the mother. Your leader is a dishonest soul, and you too will perish before you reach the forest’s end, by his hand and insidious guidance. Do not perceive me to be weak, I am days old and will soon return underground, but I am a vessel to the great network and I harbour its knowledge and my soul has been in wake for aeons, I see through your weak soul and nurse nothing but pity for your inevitable, unjust demise. Your foe is near, we have seen how they kill, they are a gruesome tribe and have not only mutilated travellers but have spoiled our soil and devoured our kind creatures’. Nemo lay in hypnosis, grasped by the mushroom’s deep green eyes, which were tunnels into the core of an archaic wisdom, he wept in repentance but he could not hear his own voice. Only the thundering words of the old mushroom. The captain found him in a puddle of his own vomit and pointed and laughed and returned to the screeching men conferring in strange gibberish all chanting in dissonant song. Naked and wriggling among each other, wrestling and laughing hysterically. The Captain smoked and watched slapping his knee roaring with glee.

A Kingdom’s Heart     
     
### **Chapter 6: The Uneasy Crown**

The sun rose over New San Juan, painting the sky in soft hues of orange and pink. The city bustled with its usual energy, but beneath its vibrant surface, tensions simmered. Sebastián sat at his desk in Casa Montalvo, reviewing a dossier from Director Elena Morales. It was thick with reports of unrest, political maneuvering, and economic sabotage.

Antonia Reyes entered quietly, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. “The reports from the port just arrived,” she said, setting the cup down.

Sebastián nodded, though his attention was fixed on the dossier. “What’s the mood in New San Juan?”

“Cautious,” Antonia replied. “The workers are nervous, but the Port Authority is holding things steady. Director Morales sent word that another attempt at sabotage was intercepted last night.”

Sebastián closed the dossier with a sigh, leaning back in his chair. “The opposition is relentless. They think Barrera’s austerity measures weaken us, but it only makes our enemies bolder.”

---

A Meeting with Javier Ortega

General Javier Ortega arrived shortly after, his boots clicking against the marble floors of the study. He removed his hat respectfully as Antonia showed him in.

“General,” Sebastián greeted him. “What news from Cuba?”

Ortega sat across from him, his expression grim. “China's business presence is growing. They’ve secured contracts with key factions in Havana, promising development aid in exchange for influence.”

“And the Iron Spine?” Sebastián asked.

“Still operational, but barely,” Ortega admitted. “We’ve managed to keep their hands off the railway itself, but they’re pressing hard.”

Sebastián steepled his fingers, deep in thought. “We need to make the Cubans realize that a stronger Puerto Rico means a stronger Caribbean. Offer them guarantees—security, trade benefits. And if that fails, remind them of the reversion clause.”

Ortega raised a brow. “And if they state they've operated for years without a strong Puerto Rico?”

“Then I will invoke the reversion clause. If I must,” Sebastián said firmly. “But I’d prefer cooperation to conflict.”

---

The Santiago Family Returns

Later in the day, Judge Elena Santiago and her daughter Camila arrived at Casa Montalvo. They carried documents detailing the latest legal challenges against Barrera’s policies.

“Governor Barrera’s administration is exploiting every loophole it can find,” Elena began. “They’ve even tried to cut funding for the judiciary entirely.”

Sebastián glanced at the stack of papers. “And the courts?”

“Overwhelmed but holding,” Elena said. “For now. But without intervention, it’s only a matter of time before the backlog cripples us.”

Camila spoke up hesitantly. “There’s another issue, Governor. The cases tied to foreign influence—specifically Chinese and French interests—are being delayed intentionally. Someone’s protecting them.”

Sebastián’s jaw tightened. “Who?”

“We don’t have names yet,” Elena admitted. “But the trail leads back to Barrera’s inner circle.”

---

A Private Exchange with Isabella Vélez-Campo

As dusk fell, Sebastián found Isabella Vélez-Campo in the library, poring over a legal text. She looked up as he entered, her expression sharp and focused.

“You’ve heard about the judiciary’s struggles?” Sebastián asked, taking a seat across from her.

Isabella nodded. “It’s deliberate. Barrera’s administration is trying to undermine the courts to consolidate power. If we don’t act soon, they’ll succeed.”

“What’s your recommendation?” Sebastián asked.

“Use the House of Lords,” Isabella said. “They have the authority to intervene in cases of governmental overreach. It’s a drastic step, but it may be the only way to protect the judiciary.”

Sebastián considered her words carefully. “And what about the influences of the China and France?”

Isabella’s gaze hardened. “We’ll need more than legal measures for that. I’ll start assembling a team to trace the money and expose their networks.”

---

A Reflection on Power

That night, Sebastián sat alone on the balcony of Casa Montalvo, the city lights twinkling in the distance. He held a letter from Austria, its seal unbroken. It had been sent by Claudia Herrera, their ambassador in Vienna, but Sebastián hesitated to open it.

Antonia Reyes appeared beside him, her presence as calming as ever. “You’ve been quiet all evening,” she said.

Sebastián sighed. “Sometimes I wonder if I’ve done more harm than good. The alliances, the deals—they’re all fragile. And now Barrera is unraveling everything we built.”

Antonia placed a hand on his shoulder. “You’ve always known the risks, Sebastián. But you also knew the rewards. Puerto Rico is stronger because of you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.”

Sebastián gave her a faint smile. “Let’s hope you’re right, Antonia. The future depends on it.”"
Bitcoin Today 01/22/2025: Trump reference dominates cryptocurrency purchases,CapitalistExploits,1i7h5rt,2025-01-22 12:52:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7h5rt/bitcoin_today_01222025_trump_reference_dominates/,kayakero,,"Leaving behind the sharp correction of the previous day, Bitcoin (BTC) rose again and reached $105,000 USD, with a 2% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the main cryptocurrency in the market reached $105,275 USD, registering a growth of 2.1% in this period.

With this recovery, the Top 10 cryptocurrencies also showed notable gains. Solana (SOL), which suffered one of the biggest drops during the correction, appreciated by 6.3%, achieving the largest rise in the Top 10. This pushed its price up to $254 USD, accumulating a 36% increase in the last seven days.

On the other hand, the slogan “DOGE to Mars” benefited Dogecoin, the largest of the memecoins, which registered a 5.6% increase on Wednesday (22). In the Top 100, the AI16Z memecoin appreciated again with a rise of 34%, while XDC led the few falls in the ranking with a loss of 7%.

**Number 47**

Following the first day of the most pro-crypto president in US history, cryptocurrency prices experienced a sharp drop before recovering. But how can this be explained?

For Bitget analyst Bonveti, the market has a short memory, “like that of a goldfish.” According to him, investors tend to react more to immediate fears than to long-term plans.

Interestingly, while many were selling their tokens, Donald Trump made significant buying moves that are drawing attention. On the day of his inaugural address, President Trump invested $28 million USD in cryptocurrencies. According to Bonveti, the distribution was as follows:

* **$4.7 million USD** in ETH
* **$4.7 million USD** in WBTC
* **$4.7 million USD** in AAVE
* **$4.7 million USD** in LINK
* **$4.7 million USD** in TRX
* **$4.7 million USD** in ENA

>

It is worth noting that these purchases occurred after a sharp sell-off in the price of the $**TRUMP** memecoin, when several investors decided to take profits.

**Recovery**

Furthermore, Trump’s treasury wallet now contains $35.5 billion USD worth of TRUMP and $17.5 billion USD worth of other memecoins. This shows that the president has not yet liquidated all of his tokens, which have had a considerable impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, the **World Liberty Finance** project, backed by the Trump family, continues to diversify its sources of income. According to CriptoFácil, this project has accumulated at least $25 million USD in tokens such as LINK, TRX, AAVE and others.

Any tips on self-forgiveness?,BPDlovedones,1i7dtx5,2025-01-22 10:35:54,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1i7dtx5/any_tips_on_selfforgiveness/,tjd_h,,"I escaped from my undiagnosed but likely bpd ex at the end of April last year. We had one last argument, and although she needed to leave the country for work that weekend she tried to stay because of the argument. I did what I needed to do and lied through my teeth to get her to go because I knew it would be my only chance to escape. I moved all my most important possessions into storage, put all my plants in an Uber XL and stayed with a friend. She blew up my phone as expected, messaged my close friends in the middle of the night and cyber stalked me in the months that followed. I felt guilty but I would make the decisions I made again in a heartbeat. 

I flew home for a month a couple of weeks after my escape because my dad had dementia and another terminal condition that was getting worse. There, I processed the guilt for what I did and the breakup, I thought I’d never be ok again but I was. Then my dad passed away in August. I guess that’s why I’m still processing things now. I didn’t have the mental space. 

I’m struggling to forgive myself for screwing up my life and not leaving sooner when the signs of instability were abundantly clear. My life was good before she came along - I rented my own place and I had great friends. She changed all of that. I moved in with her because she told me I was the only good thing in her life, I integrated her into my climbing club and network of friends because she didn’t have any friends and all these bad things happened to her (which were actually just the consequences of her own actions)

Now I’ve moved back into my old neighborhood which I missed so much. I have roommates now, I’m in therapy, and things are going “well”…but I can’t forgive myself for ignoring all the signs. I recently realised that she technically sexually assaulted me on our first date and I let it slide because she was so wasted the security guard made me take her home. Our first bad argument 2 months in, I highly suspect she started banging her head on a glass door at my old place. What kind of dumbass sticks around after that? Breaking it off after a couple months would have been so much easier. I’m a 34 year old grown ass adult. What was wrong with me? 

When I tell my therapist and my friends, they say I’m being too hard on myself, and that the good thing is that I left, and that since this was my first relationship since coming out (late bloomer lesbian here), the rose coloured glasses were hard to take off. I know they’re right but it’s finally dawning on me how I abandoned the shit out of myself. I have my ex blocked on everything, but she’s messaged my friends over the months and I worry about being stalked. I have dreams where she’s stalking me, or where we’re still together and I have to escape again. 

I know I’ll work through this with time but…can anyone relate or share how they navigated similar feelings?"

TRUMP coin ($TRUMP) price prediction: third-party price target,capitalcom,1i77mhs,2025-01-22 04:48:10,6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/capitalcom/comments/1i77mhs/trump_coin_trump_price_prediction_thirdparty/,capital_com,,"TRUMP coin is a memecoin which combines cryptocurrency with politics. Officially endorsed by the 47th President of the United States – Donald Trump – TRUMP adopts the likeness of its namesake for its branding.

In early 2025, TRUMP’s market capitalisation grew to over $10 billion, propelling it to the top of cryptocurrency rankings like CoinMarketCap in under two days following its 17 January 2025 launch.

Here are the TRUMP crypto price predictions for 2025 and beyond, with insights from third-party analysts and market experts.

# TRUMP coin price prediction for 2025 and beyond

TRUMP coin price forecasts for 2025 show a mixed outlook, reflecting the token’s short price history and memecoin status.

[CoinCodex](https://coincodex.com/crypto/official-trump/price-prediction/) forecasts an $133.19 average TRUMP price in 2025, with a potential all-time high of $234.64 in February and a low of $50.50 in January.

By 2027, they anticipate an average price of $52.99, with a $62.33 high and a $46.28 low.

[Coinpedia](https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/official-trump-price-prediction/) forecasts a potential $67 average TRUMP price in 2025, along with a $100 high and a $35 low. For 2026: they anticipate a $92 average [TRUMP price](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart), with a $139 yearly high and a $46 low.

Gautam Chhugani and his team of analysts at private wealth management firm [Bernstein](https://www.theblock.co/post/335724/bernstein-trump-memecoin-paradigm-shift) provide their outlook in a January 2025 note, saying ‘it signifies a new regulatory era, where governments see crypto as a technology to reach out to the masses directly.’

Bernstein analysts also [noted](https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/43082005/market-to-seek-further-information-on-utilization-of-80-trump-token-supply-says-bernstein) that ‘the team could use TRUMP coin as collateral to build something useful in crypto banking and finance or build an engagement model to reward supporters/holders. Or it could use it as a treasury asset to fund more Trump-related political initiatives, indicating the token’s potential for future growth.

# TRUMP coin price predictions: analysts’ price target view 

Only a small number of analysts provide [TRUMP coin price](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart) predictions for 2030 and beyond, due to its relatively short existence. Here’s how they compare:

||**2030**|||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||**Low**|**Avg**|**High**|
|**CoinCodex**|$124.39|$164.09|$199.34|
|**Coinpedia**|$109|$243|$378|
|**Coinedition**|$200|$280|$350|
|**Digital Coin Price**|$212.18|$227.79|$243.29|

Looking further afield, [Coinedition](https://coinedition.com/official-trump-price-prediction/) forecasts an average $550 TRUMP price for 2040 with a $800 high and $400 low. In 2050, they predict a $1,500 average, $2,000 maximum, and $880 minimum TRUMP price.

Meanwhile, [Digital Coin Price](https://digitalcoinprice.com/forecast/official-trump) anticipates TRUMP prices reaching a $335.46 maximum, $301.58 minimum, and $324.35 average price in 2031.

Then for 2034, they expect an $869.54 high price, $838.82 low price and $860.98 average TRUMP price.

# Could TRUMP coin reach $100?

Speculation around [TRUMP coin’s price](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart) has surged since its dramatic entry into the market in January 2025. Within days of launch, the politically branded memecoin achieved an all-time high of $75.35, capturing significant attention from traders and analysts alike.

Reaching the $100 milestone will depend on several key factors. 

Boaz Sobrado, fintech analyst and [Capital.com](http://Capital.com) employee,  says 'Trump Coin's potential ceiling is a subject of intense speculation, while a scientific long-term price prediction is impossible… simple arithmetic suggests that if Trump Coin were to overtake Dogecoin as the premier meme coin, its price could potentially reach $100-300 per token.’

Writing for [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/18/official-trump-coin-how-did-we-get-here/), Sobrado also notes that, ‘while such projections are highly speculative and assume limited selling from insiders, they highlight the significant paper wealth creation effects of the meme coin space.’

# What are the TRUMP crypto coin price drivers?

Learn the key factors driving analysts’ price predictions, and how they could influence [TRUMP coin's price](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart) movements in the coming years:

**Political events and endorsements**

TRUMP is a politically branded memecoin. High-profile developments – such as endorsements, public appearances, or campaign initiatives officially tied to Donald Trump – could boost market enthusiasm, potentially influencing price rises.

Conversely, because TRUMP coin’s identity is closely linked to a single public figure, it may face increased volatility. If the former president becomes embroiled in legal challenges or divisive debates, the coin’s reputation could suffer, resulting in downward price pressure.

**Social media trends and hype**

Social media platforms are central to memecoin culture, including TRUMP coin. Viral hashtags, influencer shout-outs, and trending memes can rapidly elevate the token’s visibility. This could lead to FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail traders, potentially influencing prices higher.

If, however, social sentiment or online chatter declines, the enthusiasm that once propelled TRUMP could fade just as quickly. Memecoins often rely on continuous buzz to sustain demand; a lack of new, engaging content or a shift in focus to another trending token could stall TRUMP’s price momentum.

**Broader cryptocurrency market trends**

[TRUMP’s price](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart) can be influenced by the overall direction of the market. In a bullish phase, where traders exhibit a higher risk appetite, memecoins can benefit from increased inflows as traders look for the ‘next big thing’.

Conversely, during market downturns, riskier assets like TRUMP tend to see steeper declines than more established cryptocurrencies. If the wider crypto sentiment turns bearish, traders may pivot towards safer, more liquid markets – potentially leaving TRUMP with reduced liquidity and heightened price volatility.

**Solana network performance**

TRUMP is built on the [Solana](https://capital.com/solana-sol-price-prediction-is-it-a-solid-investment) blockchain, known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. These qualities can make TRUMP accessible to a wider user base, encouraging frequent trades and supporting its long-term viability.

However, Solana has experienced congestion and technical challenges in the past. If the network encounters performance issues or security concerns, user confidence in TRUMP could wane. Higher fees or slower transaction times may erode traders’ trust, potentially undermining the coin’s growth prospects.

**Media coverage and public perception**

Positive media stories highlighting TRUMP’s endorsements, deflationary mechanics, or unique branding could stimulate fresh interest among both crypto enthusiasts and casual observers. Mainstream attention can also validate the token’s presence, driving up its trading volume in the short term.

On the flip side, negative headlines – especially those spotlighting political controversies or regulatory scrutiny – could harm the token’s reputation. If traders perceive TRUMP as overly speculative or controversial, sentiment may sour and lead to sell-offs that drive the price lower.

**Speculative trading and whale activity**

Memecoins are often propelled by speculation, and TRUMP is no different. Large trades executed by major holders, known as ‘whales’, may trigger swift price swings, creating opportunities for short-term gains. If a whale buys a substantial amount of TRUMP, other traders might follow suit, pushing prices up.

Conversely, these sharp fluctuations come with heightened risk. A significant sell trade from a whale could spook other traders, sparking panic and rapid price declines. 

# What’s the TRUMP meme coin price history?

TRUMP coin launched in the cryptocurrency market with substantial momentum following its 17 January 2025 launch. Within just days, its market capitalisation rose above $10 billion, and it gained significant media attention.

The coin’s price gained immediate traction during its first 24 hours of trading. On 18 January 2025, TRUMP’s price trajectory saw dramatic growth as more exchanges introduced the token. Starting the day below $10, it climbed rapidly, surpassing $10 by 6am, crossing the $20 mark by 10am, and reaching over $30 by 4pm. TRUMP then consolidated, trading between $20 and $30 for the remainder of the day.

On 19 January 2025, the token resumed its bullish momentum. By 4am, its price had risen above $30, and by 7am, it had exceeded $40. This surge culminated in an all-time high of $75.35 later that day.

However, following this meteoric rise, TRUMP’s price faced a pullback. As of now, the token exhibits significant volatility, characteristic of many memecoins. Its debut and fluctuating price patterns underscore the speculative nature of TRUMP coin’s market dynamics, influenced by a mix of hype, social media trends, and political branding.

# TRUMP coin trading strategies to consider

Here are some potential trading strategies aligned with TRUMP coin’s market dynamics. Choose one that suits your preferences, including risk tolerance, time commitment, and trading goals. Here are some to consider:

**Trend trading strategy**

Trend trading involves identifying and following the direction of TRUMP coin’s price movement. [Trend traders](https://capital.com/trend-trading) might rely on [technical analysis](https://capital.com/market-analysis) tools – such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), moving averages and more – to identify potential trends and establish entry and exit points.

TRUMP is a memecoin and its price may be subject to sudden reversals due to social media sentiment or political developments, so regular monitoring is crucial.

**Scalp trading strategy**

Scalping is a short-term trading approach where traders open and close multiple positions within a single trading day. Given TRUMP coin’s volatility, scalping can take advantage of rapid price movements. But due to the large number of trades that you’ll tend to open and close, transaction fees – like spreads – can eat into returns.

**Statistical arbitrage strategy**

Statistical arbitrage involves using algorithms or data analysis to identify temporary price deviations in TRUMP’s price relative to other cryptocurrencies or memecoins. Statistical arbitrage is rooted in mean reversion theory, which assumes that asset prices will eventually revert to their historical relationships. 

Statistical arbitrage isn’t recommended for the casual trader – it requires plenty of experience, along with access to algorithmic trading and large datasets. 

**Swing trading strategy**

Swing trading focuses on capturing short- to medium-term price moves. [Swing traders](https://capital.com/swing-trading) look for patterns or reversals in TRUMP’s price charts and hold positions for days or weeks, depending on their analysis. 

As with trend trading, it’s worth remembering that TRUMP coin’s meme status can result in sudden price reversals that invalidate traditional swing trade setups. 

# Risks and rewards of crypto trading

Consider the potential risks and rewards of the [cryptocurrency market](https://capital.com/cryptocurrency-the-who-what-why-and-how-of-bitcoin-cash) to help prepare yourself for [TRUMP coin](https://capital.com/trump-to-us-dollar-chart) trading.

# Potential rewards

**Early-stage growth potential**

Immediately following its January 2025 launch, TRUMP coin demonstrated immense growth potential, achieving a market capitalisation exceeding $10 billion within days. For early traders, such rapid traction could present significant profit opportunities – as well as risks.

**Political branding**

TRUMP coin’s association with President Donald Trump offers a unique advantage in terms of brand recognition. High-profile endorsements and campaign-related activities could bolster the coin’s visibility and market demand.

**Social-media-driven hype**

TRUMP coin is positioned to benefit from the viral nature of memecoins. If it continues to attract attention on platforms like Twitter and TikTok, this widespread engagement could fuel further price rallies.

**Low transaction costs and fast trades**

Built on the Solana blockchain, TRUMP coin enjoys the advantages of the network’s low fees and high transaction speeds – though this may vary depending on factors like network congestion – making it accessible to a broader user base and encouraging frequent trading activity.

# Potential risks

**Extreme volatility**

Like many memecoins, TRUMP coin is highly speculative, with prices subject to sudden and sharp fluctuations. Traders who lack proper risk management strategies may face substantial losses during downturns.

**Dependence on political events**

TRUMP coin’s identity is tied closely to Donald Trump. While this can be a strength, political controversies or negative headlines involving Trump could lead to steep price declines.

**Social sentiment risks**

TRUMP coin’s success relies heavily on sustained hype and social media buzz. A decline in online chatter or a shift of interest to another memecoin could lead to waning demand and falling prices.

**Regulatory scrutiny**

TRUMP coin could attract regulatory attention due to its association with a political figure. Potential crackdowns or restrictions could limit its availability on exchanges, deterring traders.

**Whale-driven market manipulation**

As with many memecoins, large holders (whales) may manipulate TRUMP coin’s price by executing substantial buy or sell orders. This could create artificial volatility and increased risk for smaller traders.

# FAQ

**Is TRUMP coin a good trade or investment?**  
Whether TRUMP coin is a good trade depends on your financial goals, market knowledge, and risk tolerance. As a politically themed memecoin, TRUMP is characterised by high volatility and speculative interest, making it both a high-risk and potentially high-reward asset. Always conduct thorough research, understand the associated risks, and only trade funds you can afford to lose.

**Could TRUMP coin reach $100?**  
It is difficult to predict with certainty whether TRUMP coin will reach $100. Such a price target would depend on multiple factors, including market demand, tokenomics, and broader cryptocurrency trends. As with all speculative assets, price predictions should be approached with caution, and no trade comes with guarantees.

**Could TRUMP coin go up or down?**  
The future price direction of TRUMP is unpredictable. Factors such as political events, market sentiment, and social media trends can heavily influence its value. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, so prices can rise or fall sharply in a short period. Always assess your financial capacity and risk tolerance before trading, and remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Should I invest or trade in TRUMP coin?**  
The decision to trade or invest in TRUMP coin is a personal one that should be based on thorough research and a clear understanding of the risks. While TRUMP coin may appeal to those looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities, its speculative nature means prices can fluctuate dramatically. Only trade with funds you are willing to lose, and consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks

I started a paragraph and it turned into a near novel. SMH. There's just too many examples of Conservative regret...,youvotedforthat,1i77h1r,2025-01-22 04:36:33,277,0.99,31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i77h1r,stillkindabored1,,"""Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.""
– Martin Luther King Jr.

I'm not an intellectual, I'm not a social commentator, but I do know what lurve is Jennay. I have done my best to use reputable sources in the time I have to elucidate my observations below. I have an inkling of what I don't know but do not profess to be an expert. This is the vibe I'm getting.

If there's some misquoted references, I am open to correction.

Even before the inauguration, there was one saving grace... 

Watching the conservative meltdowns with all the post-election bait and switches. The leopards eating faces is in full swing. It's all over social media and it's pretty to watch.

Farmers, hospitality and builders are shitting themselves, both employer and employees, about the no holds barred ""undocumented immigrant"" deportation plans. Ex-allies cracking the shits. Lowsco MAGATs regretting being dumb. Tech Bros wondering WTF happened. Just all round regret out there for the world to see. 

So I'll start with who I feel are the biggest of losers, whom have realised they have backed their antichrist - the ""illegals"". The ones who no matter how hard they try will never be ""oNe oF uS"".

Believe it or not, undocumented immigrants, the ""illegals"" made up as of 2022, a massive estimated 8.3 million people in the civilian workforce (static notably since 2007), that constitutes about 5% of those working or seeking work in America. They are massively overrepresented in certain jobs... You know, the ones that no ""white"" people want to do... The low paid or back breaking laborious jobs. That's 26% of farming, fisheries, and forestry workers; 17% of cleaning, maintenance, and groundskeeping workers; 14% of construction workers; and 11% of food preparation workers. (Wikipedia)

These people have been ""factored in"" to the economy for decades they keep prices low and businesses operating. Now they are suddenly about to be ripped out of the economy where they contribute approximately $11.7 billion annually in state and local taxes (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy), add around $13 billion annually to Social Security, but only withdraw about $1 billion in benefits. (Social Security Administration 2016)

About 50% of undocumented immigrants file federal income tax returns, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI, 2023). Despite this, they are ineligible for most federal and state benefits funded by their taxes, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. (Congressional Budget Office, 2020)

The Latino vote - especially males was pivotal in key swing states. For instance, in Florida, Trump won 56% of the Latino vote, contributing significantly to his victory in the state. (Phoenix Florida)

With talk prior to the election, that mass deportations would be an executive order, yesterday it came true, with him signing the order for the ""largest deportation program in American history."" This plan includes deploying military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Fox 5 News)

Not only will they try to deport the undocumented, but he has signed another order with intent to end ""birthright citizenship"". That is, the deportation of children and grandchildren of undocumented immigrants born in the USA. (Politico)

Deportation to places they have never been and maybe don't even speak the language. 

The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution included the provision for birthright citizenship. The order will be challenged and I assume will end up in SCOTUS. 

Those hungry leopards will be fended off by the American Civil Liberties Union law suits.(WSJ).I picture the ACLU will have many fights over the next 4 years. Often fighting a fight for those that actively or passively acted against their own self-interest. Rowwwwrrr.

So what about all of those soon to be missing illegal workers? The deported children of those illegal immigrants? The once 5% of the workforce, now leaving so much work to whom?

Hence, as I said, farmers are shitting themselves. But I have a theory. 

Did you notice the surge in prison stock prices on Trump's victory? Private prison stocks the ""for profit incarceration"" industry, experienced notable gains. GEO Group's shares rose by 74%, and CoreCivic's shares increased by 55% after the election. (Financial Times). GEO donated nearly a million USD to Trump. (News Week).

I'm betting that of those 8.3 million workers to be ""deported"" most won't be. Either it's another broken promise to the Base or they will be put into prison farms and turned into slave labour. 

This is where the 13th Amendment of the Constitution does support Trump and the potential for this to happen. 

""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" (Constitution of the United States of America). 

You see, after the abolition of slavery, Southern states faced economic challenges due to the loss of free labor. The exception clause ""except for punishment of crime"" allowed these states to maintain a labor force through the criminal justice system, leading to practices like convict leasing, where incarcerated individuals were leased to private enterprises for labor. (History Channel). Southern states then enacted laws known as Black Codes to criminalize minor offenses, disproportionately targeting African Americans. But this time it's the Latinos.

The legacy of the exception clause is still evident in today's criminal justice system, where prison labor remains prevalent. (Cornell Law Review). Trump will build on this. 

Social media has been full of conservative regret about this. People voting against themselves because they went in blind, or just thought ""not me, they are talking about the criminals"". In other cases I've seen spouses voting against their partners position or children voting against their parents position. If the ACLU isn't successful, that will rope the leopard lovers into it. It's sad that the non conservative informed will be dragged into this also. 

However, the unholy alliance of the president and the first lady Elona has probably been the most interesting, with Elona going against the MAGAT ideals and promoting the increase in H1-B visas. The visa that allows entry to ""higher educated"" workers. You know, the ones that bring in sub continental Indians, who will work for a pittance, accept lower work standards, be shit scared to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and being deported back home. 

That comes off the back of Tesla sacking 6600 tech workers and bringing in 1300 H1-B workers (Snopes). But it doesn't stop there. 

It's a thing of beauty and I compiled this before the inauguration, so this shit is going to ramp up like a petrol fire. It leads to the next face eating fest that is so beautiful to see... 

That's the Ultra MAGAs like Bannon, Fuentes and Loomer, who are now mad enough to lynch a history book. They see the unholy alliance as a betrayal by Trump for accepting any immigration (and themselves not personally benefiting from it). 

Loomer, the conspiracy theorist and out of the closet, proud to be racist, Fuentes the ""your body my choice"" mysoginist and Bannon the once been to gaol for Trump, fell out, now back to bros, advocate for America over every other country policy. He decided to do the time by contempting congress in refusing to be deposed by the select committee in the Jan 6 insurrection investigation. The committee that Trump, Loudermilk and some house members have called to have prosecuted, due to investigating the King's trying to overturn the election. So Bannon is that type like the consumate Libertarian, that takes no notice that the position they are in now, has taken centuries of social cooperation, domestically or internationally, But hey now I'm on top now, so let's rip out the carpet and every one for themselves. You know, that ""America First"" policy Trump holds dear.

So these guys didn't seem to notice that Trump flip flops to any position that benefits him and now that the First Couple are in bed for plenty of dollarydoos, the minions are angrier than a redneck at a tofu festival. So pretty.

His supporters.... Damn. They are on the same page and spitting chips for the same reason. They would rather have José the spud digger and his family sent packing, than take a middle of January swim in the newly named Gulf of America. ""SMH on that one"", being chalked up as a win for the new administration, some of the irate MAGATs are saying.

I guess the next biggest feast of the leopards I'm seeing online is in reference to the tarrifs. I'm not seeing as many regular punters picking up on this on twitter or conservative Reddit, as they are, in the majority a bit to dense to understand them independently.

They only really pick up the gist when they are interviewed online, where they start off raving about how awesome it is that China is going to pay 25 to 50% more for what America buys from them. Yeh... I'll say that again. China will pay more for what America buys from China. TBH I think that is what Trump thought when he started talking about Tarrifs back in 2016 too. But once he's there, he's there, and just like a rabbid kangaroo, there's no going backwards. Remember Sharpygate?

Back in 2016 he tried the tarrif thing and implemented them in 2018, firstly on Aluminium imports, washing machines and solar panels (USTR press release). Maybe he had an inkling that Russia could do with a few more on the international market, so they could actually have some outside St Petersburg and Moscow. The Russians attempted to made up the difference during the Ukraine invasion, but just got distracted by actual toilets. Maybe porcelain shitters should have been on that tarrif list also?

So in 2019, next was the Chayyyna tarrifs, 25% on $50 billion worth of goods. (USTR section 301 Fact Sheet) that launched a retaliatory response. A trade war. The interesting thing was however, that Chayyyna was strategic in their implementation of retaliation.

Retaliatory tariffs targeted various American products, notably agricultural goods such as soybeans, pork, and corn. Boom they hit the red regions of the US, those that supported Trump (US-China Business Council).  Studies indicated that these tariffs led to increased prices for U.S. consumers and disruptions in supply chains. (Princeton Economics Department) Enter leopards that love an ignorant voter.

So, it is widely known among economists that protectionist tarrifs are counter productive. It's why they have lost favour since the 1930s when the Smoot-Hawley Tarrif Act blew up in the faces of the depression ridden country, leading to a global trade war and exacerbation of the great depression. (National Bureau of Economic Research). Countries imposing retaliatory tariffs decreased their imports from the United States by approximately 28% to 32%, highlighting the detrimental impact on U.S. export markets (Oxford Academic).

Trumps tarrifs will now be aimed squarely at China, Mexico and Canada and have been cited as 25% on his neighbours and 60% on China. (Business Insider). The aim, to increase revenue and increase domestic production. 

So now we are looking at increasing government revenues, which will now be paid for by the American consumer.

In 2017, having lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%  PERMANENTLY via the Tax Cut Jobs Act. Individuals in the median earning bracket of $42k went from 25% to 22% and those on over $418k went from 39.6% to 37%, but that has an expiry of this year (Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis).

His TCJA is projected to add approximately $1.9 trillion to the national debt over a decade (Congressional Budget Office).

He now proposes lowering the corporate rate again now to just 15% for American Corporations. (Thompson Reuters Tax and Accounting). 

Nice one American consumer, you are now going to pay at the shop for the tarrifs, whilst the tax break is given to the corporation and you can be assured it will not be trickling down. Voodoo Economics is a Reagan myth.

There may be an increase in domestic production in some sectors? Industries such as steel and aluminum may experience short-term gains due to reduced competition from imports. However, past experiences indicate that initial benefits can be offset by broader economic challenges, including retaliatory measures. (Reuters)

And so who's likely to have their faces adjusted by a big cat? 

The automotive sector. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico could disrupt the supply chain as the automotive industry is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on cross-border trade. 

Michigan - Ford and General Motors, Battleground State. Well done Trump. 
South Carolina- BMW, Red State. Tennessee- Nissan. Red State. 
Kentucky- Ford, Red State.
Georgia - Kia, Red state.
Indiana - Subaru Red State.
Mississippi -Nissan, Red State.
Alabama- Mercedes US, Red State. 
Texas- Toyota and Tesla, Red State. 
California- Tesla, Blue State and that aint changing. 

Already, U.S. automotive manufacturers have expressed significant concerns regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adverse effects such measures could have on their operations and the broader industry.

General Motors analysts indicate that GM, could face substantial profit declines if a 25% tariff is imposed. The increased costs associated with these tariffs are likely to be passed on to consumers. (US News Money)

All them redneck semi-iliterate cowboy pickup lovers and factory workers will find out that Ram Trucks is projected to experience a significant reduction in annual core profits if the tariffs are implemented. The company may need to reassess its production strategies to mitigate the financial strain caused by increased import costs. (The Hill)

The additional costs incurred from tariffs are anticipated to be transferred to consumers, resulting in higher vehicle prices. This could lead to a decrease in demand, further impacting the financial performance of U.S. automakers. 

Yeeeehaww Grandmaw! Them majority red state employees might be getting their Xmas bonus delayed for a bit because you and I know, shareholder profits take precedence over the common folk.

What else will suffer?  Well them techbro Melon fanbois are not gunna be happy. Products such as electronics, apparel, and beauty items are expected to see price increases as companies pass on the additional costs of tariffs to consumers.  (Vogue Business)

The complex tech supply chains that rely on intricate global supply are unlikely to be duplicated in the United States, high labour costs compared to Mexico and China just ain't gonna let it happen. Look forward to paying two grand for your PS6 or 3 K for your new NVIDIA RTX 5090 . Lol. Already inventories are being stockpiled but that ain't gonna last long. It's expected that sales will decline up to 68% (Signal AI)

And those farmers? Previous tariffs have resulted in retaliatory measures affecting U.S. agricultural exports. Farmers may face reduced market access with retaliation tarrifs and lower commodity prices, exacerbating financial strains within the agricultural community. (Reuters) Throw that into the fact your workforce has been incarcerated or are in hiding, and that face is going to need more than hog shit to cover the mauling.

So who else has been regretting not voting, or voting for Trump? Well probably a pretty big percentage of low-income earners which, when you check out the stats overall, is in the majority, people in red States.

Mississippi, a red state, poverty stands at 19.58%, making it the highest in the United States, while Louisiana, another red state, follows closely at 18.65%. In contrast, blue states like Massachusetts and New Jersey have significantly lower poverty rates of 8.5% and 8.2% (Visual Capitalist). 

And what goes along nicely with poverty? Medical issues. It's beautifully being played out in social media with so many rednecks saying that they're so glad Trump is going to get rid of Obamacare, but at least they'll still have the Affordable Care Act. As I write Trump has just recinded Biden's Executive Order lowering prescription drug prices under the ACA (Whitehouse.gov). 

What a choice now.... a carton of eggs or a half tablet of grannies heart medication? How fucking dumb do you have to be to vote yourself into medical bankruptcy or die because your too stupid to get past your exclusive Fox News consumption? You think Fucker Carlson ever gave a fuck about you? Maybe dig a little bit deeper to understand the nuances of things that you affect you and your kids before voting for your favourite orange thing.

Speaking of kids... You're going to be forced to have more, or just die whilst trying. Those state Republican legislatures are going to go full force in putting the lives of those unviable foetus' wellbeing above your daughter's, wife's or Mother's. Thanks Mitch and Trump for effectively stacking SCOTUS with Christian conservatives who overturned Roe. 

Already, sadly Trump voters have died. Examples such as Josseli Barnica of Texas, suffering a miscarriage and dying of sepsis due to having Trump enabled abortion laws, or Nicole Thurman dying after being denied timely abortion care due to the same laws. (ProPublica)

That shits gonna be on steroids now. Trump enabled southern states, are looking at wider travel bans for pregnant women, with Texas already having put restrictions on travel to obtain abortions out of state (AP News). I hope that red voting Daddy is gunna be happy, the meth head, that got his little girl up the stick, is gunna be hanging with him and Jr at Christmas. 

JD Vance, that guy that's going to be looking up at his two cybertruck chested daddies for the next 4 years, (the irony of this non nuclear family in the Whitehouse) has refrained from confirming or denying support for the right of pregnant women to leave the state for a termination of pregnancy (The independent). 

The University of Colorado Boulder projected that abortion bans could lead to a 24% increase in maternal mortality overall, with a 39% increase among non-Hispanic Black women. Also, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that in 2020, maternal death rates were 62% higher in states with abortion restrictions compared to those with greater access (28.8 vs. 17.8 per 100,000 births). This disparity is expected to widen post-Roe, as more states enact restrictive laws. (Home)

Time to lock up those red state daughters! Oh.... That would suite many anyway, because that's what it is about. Controlling women, not protecting a foetus. 

That's quite obvious when you look at the stats for dumped newborns post those Trump enabled SCOTUS changes. In Texas, since RvW was overturned, there was a 12.9% rise in infant mortality against the 1.8% rise over the rest of the country (JAMA Network) and at least 18 babies were deserted in 2024 alone in Texas (Yahoo News).

That's the Southern GOP/MAGA for you. Anyone that breaths air, not amniotic fluid, that doesn't earn at least the median wage, need to get a hold of them boot straps and start saving for that rainy day. You're on your own. Yep even if you voted for them.

So many other beautiful leopard stories. What about those that voted for peace because Trump is all about peace?

You didn't like the fact Biden didn't come down hard on Netanyahu? Thought Good ol TBone will step up? Lolz... That shit got settled before Biden left office and if Trump says otherwise it's a violation of the Logan Act (it will never be fully settled btw) and your complacency in voting has lead us to this. Peace?

Step in ""America First"" AKA ""fuck the rest of the world"". Not even a ""If your not with us you're against us"". That's right. Melon and Trump have both been seeing a bit on the side. Putler, who happens to be at odds with the rest of the civilised world.

That's a whole nother story and not a leopards tale. Mainly because anyone that respected Global Rule of Law would have the sense not to vote red. They probably read something other than their twitter feed whilst on the shitter. Remember that thing that Reagan stood for? Standing up to tyranny. No more of that shit now its follow the cash. Trumps been Putlers lapdog since the 80s (http://themoscowproject.org).

So Biden's sanctions on Russia have bought them to their knees. Not down and out. Putler has been waiting for his money launderer to take over and save him. Smoke and mirrors time.

Trump has already suggested using military or economic power to force Denmark to hand over the island (Reuters) with the Kremlin's Dmitry Peskov already likening it to Russia taking Crimea (justification for Russia).  Then there's Panama. He doesn't like the price of passage and that the Chinese are operating a port nearby, so that in his eyes it gives him authority to invade the country. (AP News) 

Feeling peaceful yet?

What about Canada? Thought it was a joke? Watch this space. It won't happen but the rhetoric gives a glimpse of the level of power he's looking for. He's praised Putin, Xi Jing Ping, Kim Jong il and Orban, despite concerns for their democratic principals or human rights records (International Business Times). 

Again as I write, Mexican drug cartels are now terrorists according to him. Troops on Mexican soil next? Well they are heading to the border right?

If you were looking for peace, between starting trade wars, alienating Allies, supporting dictators, threatening military and economic annexation, yes your apathy or action has really made the world safer. Was Palestine your motivation for not voting blue? Watch this space and keep an eye out for those big cat spots.

And then there's the uneducated battler that just doesn't have the media savvy or is just too apethetic to look for more info. Cost of living? Price of eggs? Nice slight of hand you missed there. 

The promise to make things cheeper? Told you Biden is to blame for inflation? He would bring prices down? Then told Time magazine ""it's hard to bring things down once they are up"". Just remember that, in 4 years after the trade wars are in full swing.

Other Conservative outcry has been the prospective cabinet picks. 

Gaetz. The statutory rapist as investigated by his own party, being found to have paid an underage girl $400 for sex and attending drug fuelled parties, paid $90k in payments for sex and drugs, obstructed congress investigations and tried to influence witnesses and also accepted impermissible gifts (AP News). Yep the GOP stood up to their own on that, (for other reasons not the debauchery), but nope the Orangeutang wanted him as the countries top prosecutor, that is, until he fell on his own sword. 

No worries. Let's replace him with someone who he can trust. Pam Bondi his impeachment lawyer who, when questioned about birthright citizenship (of which Trump signed an EO on in the following week), she said she would have to go and research it (International Business Times). Ie I don't want to go against the boss so I'll play dumb or I just am unqualified?

Or what about those conservatives that are smacking their heads about the Antivaxer who is the head of Health, RFK?  Time for a reemergence of Polio? Or his desire to ban high fructose corn syrup? Those arse fucked farmers are going to be left wondering about that one too. 

Conservative veterans on the appointment of Pete Hegseth as Def Sec. Allegations of sexual assault (potentially a qualifying point) and alcohol abuse. But more importantly he was a fucking Major in the National Guard! (Wikipedia) What a qualification. Certainly a high flyer and exposed to international level politics there. Not.

Then there's another mate of Putin's. Tulsie Gubbard. Also of Bashar al-Assad. No intelligence community history but hey she's loyal, so let's put her as the Director of National Intelligence. Adapt at parroting Russian disinformation (PBS), so maybe that was an endearing qualification? Her, despite a group of nearly 100 former national security officials urging the senate to ""carefully scrutinise"" her nomination. (The Hill) Read... Don't do it.

Then there's DR OZ. The Medicare nom. Known for having promoted pseudoscience throughout his career. In 2015, a group of physicians called for his removal from the faculty at Columbia University, citing ""egregious lack of integrity"" in promoting ""quack treatments."" (Looper) Maybe all those red voters can augment their removal of Medicare and Medicaid benifits with his green bean coffee extract, whilst the leopards feast.

All up the net worth of his cabinet is estimated to be nearly $500 billion. Double the GDP of countries of Greece or Hungary. ""Oh BoTh siDEs aRe the SaMe"" other conservatives reply. No... Biden's cabinet was $118 billion. (US News). The world sees an oligarchy forming. Melon's GROK agrees.(GROK)

Then there's another Putin contact. The ketamine addled Musk who we covered earlier. Conflict of interest central, who is already meddling in European politics, with France, Germany, Scotland, Norway and Spainish politicians criticising him (Reuters) for his Lex Luthor attitude and obvious world domination ambitions. 

Speaking of conflict of interest. Even tik tok has sparked the ire of the leopard mauled conservatives. After Trump pushed for its divestment by executive order in August 2020, on national security grounds, the ban being passed by the house to be enforced by 19 Jan 2025. Trump has extended the deadline by 75 days whilst Chinese officials consider the sale to Muskovite himself. Boom. Another tennent of moving towards a facist dictatorship. Maximum control of the media. But from what I see online, the conservatives are mainly saying ban it already.

And still on Herr Musk... Another beautiful thing, is the wakeup call for the Conservatives on the concept of him being the ""free speech abolitionist"". The moment he took over Twitter the left were being blocked, shadow banned and demonetized. The right for years continued to talk of free speech. Nazism and bigotry became Twitter's future because of that free speech (of the right). He blocked your ability to block content from your own feed that you didn't like. The EU investigated his manipulation of far right party posts during elections. (Reuters). But for the Conservatives... It only becomes an issue when they are banned. And banned they have been now. 

The H-1B visas have pissed so many off, that they are coming out in droves. Take a sip from that cup of shut the fuck up he's told them. They don't like it. 

The potentially most significant tech hiccup came when tech streamer Asmongold called him out for cheating on Path of Exile 2.

Muskovite did a live stream of him playing PoE2 and despite having a high level and good kit was walking past valuable items seemingly oblivious of their value. Asmongold called him out for potentially account sharing or outsourcing advancement. Musk didn't like this and released private DMs with Asmongold in order to deligitimise him. This riled up the techheads. Notably not all potential leopard victims. Asmongold was highlighting this off the back of Melon bragging previously, as being one of the top Diablo gamers of which others thought suss also. (The verge) The tech bros are now pushing back and could that be a big part of his future downfall? 

Another thing the tech bros are livid online about is Trump and crypto. Fucking Musk and his manipulation with DOGE coin already, but it seems as usual, Trump in his Dunning Kruger perpetual state, has learnt about crypto... Great for money laundering it seems. So in a massive conflict of interest he launched the Trump Coin followed by the Melania Meme Coin. 

Crypto coins are really cheap to startup. Can be as low as $500 to get it underway. Then the speculative market takes over. This can be exploited with what they call a ""pump and dump"". Basically the initiators buy the initial coin en mass when worth nothing, then others jump on-board to buy their own and the price goes up. The initial investors make massive profits at the expense of others by dumping the bulk and dropping the price.

Trump dropped his coin on the market the day before inauguration. Confliiiiiict? 80% of the initial investors were Trump affiliated orgs. (Wired). Within hours of release the price surged to $75.35 from 18c. A $13 billion market capitalisation. (News). Former Trump Aide Scaramucci described it as ""corruption"".(Newsweek). Within a couple of days it's now trading at 95c.(Coin Geko). It looks like the master of grift has done it again. I'd put my left nut on the line, to say not one of those first 80% hold any coin at all, in any quantity. They took techbros money and ran.

This is where the tech bros offered a lovely face delicacy to the cat. The didn't vote it on them selves, they backed the super grifter with their own hard earned cash... And lost. So pretty to see.

So what else have the leopards been feeding on? Well the 200,000 supporters that forked out to travel to DC then to find it was to be moved in doors are more than a little miffed. After spending months complaining about the price of eggs, then forking out thousands of greenbacks to get there...  

Cited as a weather move indoors, MAGA pundits were left watching the oligarchs closest and newest supporters soaking up the indoor heat.

Weather? Maybe it was just that small crowd size fear again? It was cold... But not an unprecedented temp. Wind chill of 5°F (-15°c). Regan's outdoor event was wind chill of -10°F (-23°c). I think Trump was as afraid of the smallness just like Stormy was of his. 

Then there's the event organisers who still haven't been paid. They aren't posting but the memes and news reports out there are exposing the full grift that is DJT.(See attached).

All in all, new reasons to have ones face ripped off by a leopard are popping up every couple of hours it seems. We will really see the extent in the coming years. 

Some of us will be immune. Many all over the world won't. For those Americans that did the right thing it's a sad situation. For those that were apathetic or actively supporting the future racist you can get fucked. You suffered from arrogance or ignorance and neither are an excuse for what is now going to transpire.

I have not even touched a criticism of this oligarchy, if I were to do that, I would never finish it. The Moscow connection, the lies, the manipulations, the backstabbing and the childish thin skinned selfish self serving, narcissistic escapades would run on too long. 

I have picked a few reactions to the bait and switch, the media manipulation and the grift. 

We can only hope that democracy survives, peace and the global rule of law remains intact and another lesson is learnt not to be forgotten for a long time.

""The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.""

"Dubai Property Market Outlook for 2025: Growth, Luxury, and Sustainability on the Horizon",JobXDubai,1i776a9,2025-01-22 04:12:42,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobXDubai/comments/1i776a9/dubai_property_market_outlook_for_2025_growth/,tsdmiller01,,"**Dubai Property Market Trends for 2025: An Expert Analysis**

The Dubai property market is poised for continued growth in 2025, buoyed by high demand from global investors and impressive rental yields. The numbers from 2024 paint a promising picture, with an explosion of activity resulting in 172,724 transactions and a staggering AED 441.5 billion in total sales—a 38.6% jump in transactions coupled with a 28% increase in sales value.

**Luxury Properties on the Rise**  
There’s exciting news for luxury real estate enthusiasts: prices for high-end villas, beachfront homes, and penthouses are expected to rise by 8-10% in 2025. Prime locations such as Dubai Hills Estate, Palm Jumeirah, and Jumeirah Golf Estates are particularly appealing, making them hot spots for potential homeowners and investors alike.

**Solid Rental Yields**  
Rental yields are projected to hold steady around 7%, signaling a strong and steady source of income for landlords. Popular communities like Business Bay, Dubai Marina, and Jumeirah Village Circle are attracting a steady stream of tenants, ensuring that investors remain engaged in the market.

**Foreign Interest Persists**  
Dubai retains its status as a foreign investment haven, with substantial interest in off-plan developments and new projects such as Emaar The Oasis and DAMAC Lagoons. This ongoing influx of international capital is a positive indication of the market's resilience and potential.

**Sustainability and Smart Technology Lead the Way**  
Looking ahead, sustainability and technology are set to dominate the scene in 2025. The city is placing a premium on eco-friendly properties and innovative designs, which should resonate well with tech-savvy, environmentally-conscious buyers.

**Infrastructure Boost**  
Infrastructural improvements are another essential factor driving the market. Projects like the expansion of the Dubai Metro and enhancements to local road networks will serve to bolster property values in both established and emerging neighborhoods.

**Challenges on the Horizon**  
Of course, it wouldn’t be a healthy market without a few bumps in the road! Rising construction costs and potential market saturation could pose challenges. However, experts believe that Dubai's diverse economy and welcoming policies for investors will keep the market on an upward path.

In summary, the Dubai real estate scene is set for an exciting year in 2025. With consistent demand, impressive infrastructure projects, and a robust focus on sustainability, the outlook remains bright for buyers and investors alike.

[\[Part 27\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1i988jn/the_call_of_the_breach_part_27/)

*Bang.*

A flash from a nearby window sent us scurrying for cover behind the armored trucks, and I raised my Type 9 to add to the fusillade of lead that our column flung at the offending house.

Shadowy figures bolted from behind the building and vanished into a nearby alleyway, letting out small blasts on little tin whistles as if in pre-arranged signals.

“Stay close to the trucks.” Chris’s voice echoed over the rumble of the engines, and I could just make out his silhouette up ahead, crouched beside the lead ASV. “We don’t know what we’re dealing with yet. Don’t get lured into an ambush.”

A half a block further north the street opened up into a small shopping plaza, and in the beam of our headlights I saw a dozen or more masked figures darting around behind a flaming wall of burning tires.

“There!” I shouted, and we surged forward, the trucks almost outpacing us, our troops sprinting with weapons raised.

*Wham.*

The lead ASV plowed through the fiery barricade as if it were nothing, and those of us on foot poured through the gap. However, once on the other side, I blinked at a new line of obstacles, this built from sacks of what appeared to be cement from a nearby hardware store, heaped up to provide cover for the enemy squatted behind them. More masked fighters leaned out of windows on both sides of the street, stood up from behind the cement-bag wall, or hunched behind an aged belt-fed machine gun they’d set up in the center. There were almost as many of the attackers as there were of us, and yet, as we charged into the gap to fan out in a defensive circle, none of them opened fire.

All the air caught in my lungs the instant I discovered why.

“Hold fire!” Chris ran up and down the ranks of our soldiers, his face pale. “Hold your fire, do not shoot! Hold fire!”

In front of the cement bag wall, a line of twenty people stood side-by-side, trembling in the glow of our headlights, backlit from the various fires all around us. There were men and women, old people and children, bloodied and bruised from where they’d been beaten into submission. Many wore nightclothes, pitiful little against the cold winter air, and more than one girl wore nothing at all. Some could barely stand from the injuries they’d sustained, and yet they remained motionless as a lone figure sauntered out in front of the line to face us.

I tried to inch closer, but my feet refused to move, paralyzed with sinking dread.

*What the . . .*

The figure wore a long, ragged black trench coat over his blood-stained civilian clothes, his weaponry belted around the outside of it. In one hand, he held a pistol, and with the other, he dragged a man across the cement by his shirt collar, not letting him stand, but not quite letting him fall completely to the ground either. The captive was older, perhaps in his mid-fifties, slightly balding with a touch of gray hair on the side of his head. He wore only a pair of boxers and a gore-spattered T-shirt, his face a mass of swollen red flesh. The ring finger on his left hand had been cut off, I assumed so the marauders could take a wedding band, and he was missing all the fingernails on both hands, mere bloody patches left from where they’d been ripped out.

With a contemptful shove, the masked man tossed his captive to the ground, and his green eyes rose to look at Chris and myself with casual defiance.

“Drop your weapons!” Chris bellowed over the sights of his M4, his face a shade of red that frightened me for how angry it was. “Do it now, or you’re dead men. I won’t ask twice.”

The central figure spun in a lazy half-circle to look at his men, as if mockingly checking to be sure we saw the rows of weapons pointed our way, before reaching to tug loose his mask. “Who put you in charge, Dekker?”

*Oh God, no.*

I blinked in horror as Josh’s leering face emerged from under the black cloth, his expression calm, almost indifferent to the violence around him. His rifle was slung over one shoulder, and his boots were caked with viscera, a pistol in his right hand. Judging by the red spatters on his coat sleeves, he’d been using it a lot tonight, at close range.

Chris’s face went slack with surprise, and he lowered his rifle to march toward Josh at a fast pace. “What the hell is this?”

Josh’s pistol came up to level at Chris’s nose, stopping him dead in his tracks, and the underground leader bore a wolfish smirk that made my skin crawl. “Justice. We’re giving the traitors what they wanted. A *rich* reward, for a *loyal* citizen.”

He spat the last words out with barely concealed malice, and I recognized the old ELSAR slogan, one they’d used to encourage people to collaborate with the provincial government. It hit me like a ton of bricks who the masked attackers were now, their tactics familiar, the ambush almost second nature.

*They’re ours. Our resistance fighters. My God, what have they done?*

I stared at the trembling hostages and noted how they’d been lined up to act as a human shield between us and Josh’s men. “Josh, these are *people* for God’s sake, this is murder. How could you do this? Have you lost your mind?”

“That’s rich, coming from you.” The veins in Josh’s forehead began to swell against his skin. “Partnering with the enemy, selling out to Koranti after all they’ve done to us. They brought this on themselves when they broke their word.”

“And now, thanks to you, we’ve broken ours.” Chris dared to step closer, the muzzle of Josh’s pistol mere feet from his chest. “You think ELSAR will take this lying down? You think the local population will follow us now that you’ve executed their families? You think we can keep peace when—”

“Screw your peace.” Josh’s green irises flamed with a bubbling rage that could have melted steel, and he jabbed his pistol at the balding man who shivered at his feet. “They put my sister in a camp, they forced my parents to disown me, they stuck my girlfriend’s head under a tank track. They’re not human, so why should they get to live here with those of us that are?”

His supporters nodded, flashes of anger in their eyes behind their masks. More disturbingly, I caught similar expressions beginning to spread amongst a few soldiers in our ranks, as whispers and murmurs grew. We were running out of time to fix this situation, and if we didn’t convince Josh to cease his rampage, we might be in danger of something far worse.

“I’m ordering you to stand down.” Chris didn’t break his gaze from Josh, but his thumb moved to switch the safety off on his rifle. “There are more of us than of you, and we’ve got enough heavy weapons to make this quick. You give up now, and you’ll get a trial, which is more than what you gave them.”

At that, Josh’s grin flickered with something deeper, a hatred that seemed to flow behind his countenance like it had a mind of its own.

He grabbed the collar of the balding man to drag him to a kneeling position, and twisted the bloody shirt of the captive until the poor man could hardly breathe.

“Tell them who you are.” Josh hissed into the man’s puffy face, and waved his gun in our direction without a care as to who he pointed at.

Whether out of cold or fear, the man shook like a leaf and avoided Josh’s eye. “H-Harold Drumrich, director of . . . o-of . . .”

Impatient, Josh brought his gun down on the man’s left ear and shook him so hard I thought I heard his teeth rattle. “Louder! Say it! Spit it out!”

“Director of the Social Adaptation Commission.” The balding man whimpered, holding his hands over his head in preparation for further blows.

Swallowing hard, I did my best not to grit my teeth.

*The prison camp.*

Satisfied, Josh threw Harold back to the ground and strode around him like an announcer in a circus ring. “Social Adaptation. That’s what they called it. That’s what they called kidnapping our families, violating our mothers, torturing our fathers. *Adaptation*.”

Turning on his heel, Josh pointed his free hand at our column and picked out individual soldiers one-by-one. “They got your sister remember, Murphy? Jackson, they took your mother and father on the same day. Amy, what did they do to you in Wurnauw’s office when you wouldn’t give them any names to arrest?”

Doubt tittered through our ranks, and those he called out lowered their weapons, along with their eyes. Dread prickled in my skin, as I remembered that over half of my platoon alone were former Black Oak residents, as were others in our column. They’d fought alongside Josh, endured the same torment at the hands of the Organs . . . and now, they were on opposite sides of a battlefield.

“Listen to me, we can’t start fighting again, we don’t have enough—” I paced forward, tried to plead with him, but wasn’t allowed to finish my sentence.

“They were our neighbors!” Josh shrieked to everyone in the plaza, the lines on his forehead carved with a vengeful wrath that knew no boundaries. “They turned us in, beat us, robbed us, killed us, and for what? For TV, for Wi-Fi, for *fucking chocolate!”*

He reached into the pockets of his coat, and Josh drew out a handful of silvery chocolate bars, hurling them at Harold with all his might. Bar after bar he threw, until they formed a little pile around Harold’s bare knees on the cement. I hadn’t seen a modern chocolate bar since New Wilderness, and even then, they fetched insane prices at the market. These were brand-new, and to see them made my mid spin.

*They sold people out for this? A warm house, food, that I somewhat understand, but chocolate? How could they live with themselves?*

Harold’s face lost whatever had been holding him together, and his shoulders sagged in abject defeat.

Josh’s rage slipped for a moment, and as he leaned down to Harold’s level, I caught moisture in his grass-green eyes along with a slight crack to his voice. “You killed Samantha . . . for chocolate?”

“*Enough!*” All eyes swiveled to him, and our Commander moved closer despite Josh’s gun, Chris’s sky-blue irises ablaze with indignation. “These people are civilians; they are protected by our laws the same as everyone else. You have no right to do this.”

At that, Josh laughed and cocked his head to one side. “You just don’t get it, do you? I’m done taking orders. There are more of us, plenty more once the Resistance finds out that you signed a treaty to work hand-in-hand with these scumbags. We’ve got the tunnels, we’ve got safehouses; your trucks will make nice targets, just like the Organs’ did.”

*Another war. He’s going to start another war. We can’t survive that, no one can.*

“Josh, please.” Horrified that the wild-eyed psycho in front of me had once been my friend, I slid my Type 9 behind my back on its sling and held up both empty hands in a show of desperation. “You don’t have to do this. We can hold trials, we can make sure there’s justice. . .”

“Justice?” His cool finally broke, and Josh screamed the words until his face went beet red, waving his gun in manic gestures at the burning city around us. “*Justice?* How can you say that? They stole everything from us, all so they could experiment on our families like hamsters in a cage, and you’re cooperating with them! You want ‘social adaptation’? Here you go!”

*Bang.*

“Daddy, no!” A blonde teenage girl in the hostage line let out a broken wail as Harold slumped over, his skull punctured by the bullet, both of the man’s sock feet twitching in final spasm. Fighting like a wild animal, the girl tried to run for his body, but an older woman in the line grabbed her to hold her back. The others in the line merely shut their eyes, a few muttered prayers under their breaths, while more sobbed, awaiting their turn.

Dropping his M4, Chris lunged at Josh with both hands, teeth bared in volcanic emotion.

Unrepentant, Josh brought his smoking handgun up, and my heart stopped.

*No.*

Before I knew what I was doing, I jerked the Mauser pistol from my belt and closed the distance to press its cold steel barrel under Josh’s chin.

All three of us froze, every rifle trained in our direction, both sides so tense that a single flinch could set off a firestorm.

Glaring at Josh, who had his gun jammed in Chris’s ribs, I ground my teeth to keep from sinking them into his throat, my vision borderline crimson. “Put the gun down, *now*.”

He shot daggers at me with his eyes and curled his lip at the silvery lines of my tattoos with bitterness. “I saved your life.”

“And now I’m saving yours.” Thumbing the safety lever back on my C96, I held the gun steady and fought the cascade of voices in my head that begged me to dig my fingers into his eye sockets. “Lower your weapons and walk away. You’ve made your point, you’ve killed enough; now go back underground and stay there. You do that, we let this slide.”

“Hannah—” Stuck rigid where he stood, Chris started to protest, but I pressed forward anyway.

“Come back up, or start this over again, and we’ll take flamethrowers to the tunnels.” I forced myself to gaze into the abyss that was my opponent’s eyes and saw no light there, no spark, none of the former person I’d fought with. Josh was gone, and this man who lived in his skin was closer to one of the monsters outside our gates than human. “There won’t be anywhere to go, nowhere to run, and every ranger we have will hunt you to the ends of the earth. You go now, and you live, but if you stay, if you pull that trigger, I *will* kill you.”

Behind us, a rumble of diesel engines echoed up the street, and brighter headlights shone forth as more boots thudded in to reinforce our convoy.

*“By order of the coalition government, you are hereby instructed to disperse.”* Riken’s voice called out over a loudspeaker mounted to one of the modern ELSAR fighting vehicles. In the corner of my eye, I saw his men filling in the ranks alongside ours, their rifles trained on the enemy. *“You are in direct violation of the Black Oak Accords. Lay down your weapons and clear the street.”*

Chris and I exchanged astonished and relieved glances. Never in my life had I been so happy to see ELSAR troops, and even if Riken had disobeyed orders, he couldn’t have come at a better time. Now we outnumbered the enemy two to one and were no longer outflanked.

*Give up, Josh. No one else has to die. Not unless you make the biggest mistake of your short life.*

His jaw worked, as Josh’s resentful eyes flicked back and forth between me, Chris, and the line of armored vehicles that faced him.

Seeming to understand the peril of his situation, he made an arrogant sniff at Chris. “This isn’t over.”

“Damn right it’s not.” Chris glowered back, still ready to pounce with or without a loaded gun pointed at his heart.

For a long moment, they stared at each other in seething hatred.

Josh retracted his gun and took a step back from us to bark orders over his shoulder at the others. “We’re moving out. Ditch the scum and tell the others to pack it in for the night. We’ll regroup in the northern tunnels.”

Air returned to my lungs, and I lowered my handgun, watching the line of hostages shoved our way by the masked insurgents. A few gave parting blows to their captives, some took the chance to slap, grope, or push one of the naked girls around before letting them go, but they didn’t kill any more. While their rough treatment made my blood boil, we had averted the worst of the crisis for now, and that would have to suffice.

*That was too close.*

At the last second, Josh turned to fix our line of soldiers with a smug raised eyebrow and flung his arms wide with invitation as his forces scampered off into the dark. “Anyone who wants to see their families avenged is welcome to come with me. All the rest who stay with the Organ-loving traitors will be treated the same as them. Now’s your chance.”

Disappointment cut through me as five of our number crossed over, shrugging off the hands of their companions who tried to hold them back. A few threw Chris and I vicious glares, one spat at our feet, but most didn’t bother to look at anyone. They crossed to the other side without much fanfare, and were greeted by Josh with a warm hug, as though they were old friends reunited. Only two were from my platoon, but a sixth shadow stepped out of the line, and made my heart stop beating.

“Lucille?” Stunned, I watched her slowly walk toward Josh and jogged after her. “Lucille, wait. What are you doing?”

She looked down at the dead man, then back at me.

“He’s right.” Her brown eyes burned with hateful resolution, and Lucille turned up her nose at Harold’s pooling blood. “They shot Andrea, just killed her, for no reason. They can’t get away with this.”

Panic rose in my chest, and I tried to move closer to her, but Lucille backed in Josh’s direction, who waited on the edge of the light with a surprised, but knowing smile.

*This can’t be happening.*

“You’re not thinking straight.” I shook my head, begging her, as hot tears started to form against my eyelids. “They’re hurting people, can’t you see that? You can’t go with them.”

Something about her face changed, as if the girl I knew slid beneath the surface of some inky pool of cruelty, and a young woman climbed out that I didn’t recognize. “Someone has to make them pay for what they did to my family.”

My chest tight, terrified more than I’d been in days, I held out both hands in one last attempt to pull her back from the brink. “Aren’t we family?”

For the briefest moment something tried to break through, a flicker of emotion, of pain, of the old Lucille behind her mask of stone, but then it vanished.

She took the helmet from her head, tossed it at my feet, and ripped the rank patches from her jacket sleeves as well. Lastly, she unslung the strap of my camera bag and dropped it beside the other objects with disdain.

“Your name’s not Campbell” Lucille hefted her sister’s scoped rifle in both hands and turned to plunge into the shadows with Josh.

Across town, the shots began to peter out as tin whistles blew, Josh’s marauders withdrawing into their old network of tunnels to lick their wounds and count their loot. My soul tore in my chest, and I watched Lucille fade into the night until the darkness swallowed up the last glints of her red hair. I had promised Andrea I would keep her safe, that I would watch over her, guide her, teach her everything I knew. I’d done my best to be the sister she needed like Jamie had been to me . . . and yet, I’d failed to protect Lucille from herself.

*She’s a monster now, just like him. My fault. It’s all my fault.*

“Hannah . . .” Chris tried to put a hand on my arm, but I pushed it away and stumbled back through our lines.

Avoiding the inquisitive stares of my soldiers, I circled behind an armored truck, doubled over, and vomited onto the ground."
Exploring the parks and gardens of Toulouse.,GoFrance,1i72xur,2025-01-21 23:25:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoFrance/comments/1i72xur/exploring_the_parks_and_gardens_of_toulouse/,kosspo,,"## Exploring the Parks and Gardens of Toulouse: A Breath of Fresh Air in the Pink City

The entertainment during the slow march to facism. A collection of thoughts.,Project2025Award,1i6xw1m,2025-01-21 19:23:28,654,0.99,78,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6xw1m,stillkindabored1,Government,"""Men willingly believe what they wish.""
– Julius Caesar

I'm not an intellectual, I'm not a smart man, but I do know what luuurve is. So I have hurriedly done my best in the time I have to elucidate some observations below. 

Even before the inauguration, there was one saving grace... 

Watching the conservative meltdowns with all the post-election bait and switches. The leopards eating faces is in full swing. It's all over social media and it's pretty to watch.

Farmers, hospitality and builders are shitting themselves, both employer and employees, about the no holds barred ""undocumented immigrant"" deportation plans. Ex-allies cracking the shits. Lowsco MAGATs regretting being dumb. Tech Bros wondering WTF happened. Just all round regret out there for the world to see. 

So I'll start with who I feel are the biggest of losers whom have realised they have backed their antichrist - the ""illegals"". The ones who no matter how hard they try will never be ""oNe oF uS"".

Believe it or not, undocumented immigrants, the ""illegals"" made up as of 2022, a massive estimated 8.3 million people in the civilian workforce (static notably since 2007), that constitutes about 5% of those working or seeking work in America. They are massively overrepresented in certain jobs... You know, the ones that no ""white"" people want to do... The low paid or back breaking laborious jobs. That's 26% of farming, fisheries, and forestry workers; 17% of cleaning, maintenance, and groundskeeping workers; 14% of construction workers; and 11% of food preparation workers. (Wikipedia)

These people have been ""factored in"" to the economy for decades they keep prices low and businesses operating. Now they are suddenly about to be ripped out of the economy where they contribute approximately $11.7 billion annually in state and local taxes (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy), add around $13 billion annually to Social Security, but only withdraw about $1 billion in benefits. (Social Security Administration 2016)

About 50% of undocumented immigrants file federal income tax returns, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI, 2023). Despite this, they are ineligible for most federal and state benefits funded by their taxes, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. (Congressional Budget Office, 2020)

The Latino vote - especially males was pivotal in key swing states. For instance, in Florida, Trump won 56% of the Latino vote, contributing significantly to his victory in the state. (Phoenix Florida)

With talk prior to the election, that mass deportations would be an executive order, yesterday it came true, with him signing the order for the ""largest deportation program in American history."" This plan includes deploying military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Fox 5 News)

Not only will they try to deport the undocumented, but he has signed another order with intent to end ""birthright citizenship"". That is, the deportation of children and grandchildren of undocumented immigrants born in the USA. (Politico)

Deportation to places they have never been and maybe don't even speak the language. 

The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution included the provision for birthright citizenship. The order will be challenged and I assume will end up in SCOTUS. 

Those hungry leopards will be fended off by the American Civil Liberties Union law suits.(WSJ).I picture the ACLU will have many fights over the next 4 years. Often fighting a fight for those that actively or passively acted against their own self-interest. Rowwwwrrr.

So what about all of those soon to be missing illegal workers? The deported children of those illegal immigrants? The once 5% of the workforce, now leaving so much work to whom?

Hence, as I said, farmers are shitting themselves. But I have a theory. 

Did you notice the surge in prison stock prices on Trump's victory? Private prison stocks the ""for profit incarceration"" industry, experienced notable gains. GEO Group's shares rose by 74%, and CoreCivic's shares increased by 55% after the election. (Financial Times). GEO donated nearly a million USD to Trump. (News Week).

I'm betting that of those 8.3 million workers to be ""deported"" most won't be. Either it's another broken promise to the Base or they will be put into prison farms and turned into slave labour. 

This is where the 13th Amendment of the Constitution does support Trump and the potential for this to happen. 

""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" (Constitution of the United States of America). 

You see, after the abolition of slavery, Southern states faced economic challenges due to the loss of free labor. The exception clause ""except for punishment of crime"" allowed these states to maintain a labor force through the criminal justice system, leading to practices like convict leasing, where incarcerated individuals were leased to private enterprises for labor. (History Channel). Southern states then enacted laws known as Black Codes to criminalize minor offenses, disproportionately targeting African Americans. But this time it's the Latinos.

The legacy of the exception clause is still evident in today's criminal justice system, where prison labor remains prevalent. (Cornell Law Review). Trump will build on this. 

Social media has been full of conservative regret about this. People voting against themselves because they went in blind or just thought ""not me, they are talking about the criminals"". In other cases I've seen spouses voting against their partners position or children voting against their parents position. If the ACLU isn't successful, that will rope the leopard lovers into it. It's sad that the non conservative informed will be dragged into this also. 

However, the unholy alliance of the president and the first lady Elona has probably been the most interesting, with Elona going against the MAGAT ideals and promoting the increase in H1-B visas. The visa that allows entry to ""higher educated"" workers. You know, the ones that bring in sub continental Indians who will work for a pittance, accept lower work standards, be shit scared to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and being deported back home. 

That comes off the back of Tesla sacking 6600 tech workers and bringing in 1300 H1-B workers (Snopes). But it doesn't stop there. 

It's a thing of beauty and I compiled this before the inauguration, so this shit is going to ramp up like a petrol fire. It leads to the next face eating fest that is so beautiful to see... 

That's the Ultra MAGAs like Bannon, Fuentes and Loomer who are now mad enough to lynch a history book. They see the unholy alliance as a betrayal by Trump for accepting any immigration (and themselves not personally benefiting from it). 

Loomer the conspiracy theorist and out of the closet, proud to be racist, Fuentes the ""your body my choice"" mysoginist and Bannon the once been to gaol for Trump, fell out, now back to bros, advocate for America over every other country policy. He decided to do the time by contempting congress in refusing to be deposed by the select committee in the Jan 6 insurrection investigation. The committee that Trump, Loudermilk and some house members have called to have prosecuted due to investigating the King in trying to overturn the election. 

So Bannon is like the consumate Libertarian that takes no notice that the position they are in now, has been through centuries of social cooperation, domestically or internationally, But hey now I'm on top now, so let's rip out the carpet and every one for themselves. You know, that ""America First"" policy Trump holds dear.

So these guys didn't seem to notice that Trump flip flops to any position that benefits him and now that the First Couple are in bed for plenty of dollarydoos, the minions are angrier than a redneck at a tofu festival. So pretty.

His supporters.... Damn. They are on the same page and spitting chips for the same reason. They would rather have José the spud digger and his family sent packing, than take a middle of January swim in the newly named Gulf of America. SMH on that one being chalked up as a win for the new administration, some of the irate MAGATs are saying.

I guess the next biggest feast the leopards I'm seeing online is in reference to the tarrifs. I'm not seeing as many regular punters picking up on this on twitter or conservative Reddit as they are, in the majority a bit to dense to understand them independently.

They only really pick up the gist when they are interviewed online, where they start off raving about how awesome it is that China is going to pay 25 to 50% more for what America buys from them. Yeh... I'll say that again. China will pay more for what America buys from China. TBH I think that is what Trump thought when he started talking about Tarrifs back in 2016 too. But once he's there, he's there and just like a rabbid kangaroo, there's no going backwards. Remember Sharpygate?

Back in 2016 he tried the tarrif thing and implemented them in 2018, firstly on Aluminium imports, washing machines and solar panels (USTR press release). Maybe he had an inkling that Russia could do with a few more on the international market, so they could actually have some outside St Petersburg and Moscow. The Russian attempted to made up the difference during the Ukraine invasion, but just got distracted by actual toilets. Maybe porcelain shitters should have been on that tarrif list also?

So in 2019, next was the Chayyyna tarrifs, 25% on $50 billion worth of goods. (USTR section 301 Fact Sheet) that launched a retaliatory response. A trade war. The interesting thing was however that Chayyyna was strategic in their implementation of retaliation.

Retaliatory tariffs targeted various American products, notably agricultural goods such as soybeans, pork, and corn. Boom they hit the red regions of the US, those that supported Trump (US-China Business Council).  Studies indicated that these tariffs led to increased prices for U.S. consumers and disruptions in supply chains. (Princeton Economics Department) Enter leopards that love an ignorant voter.

So, it is widely known among economists that protectionist tarrifs are counter productive. It's why they have lost favour since the 1930s when the Smoot-Hawley tarrif act blew up in the faces of the depression ridden country leading to a global trade war and exacerbation of the great depression. (National Bureau of Economic Research). Countries imposing retaliatory tariffs decreased their imports from the United States by approximately 28% to 32%, highlighting the detrimental impact on U.S. export markets (Oxford Academic).

Trumps tarrifs will now be aimed squarely at China, Mexico and Canada and have been cited as 25% on his neighbours and 60% on China. (Business Insider). The aim, to increase revenue and increase domestic production. 

So now we are looking at increasing government revenues, paid for by the American consumer. 

In 2017, having lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21%  PERMANENTLY via the Tax Cut Jobs Act. Individuals in the median bracket of $42k went from 25 to 22% and those on over $418k went from 39.6 to 37% but that has an expiry of this year (Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis).
His TCJA was projected to add approximately $1.9 trillion to the national debt over a decade (Congressional Budget Office).

He now proposes lowering the corporate rate again now to just 15% for American Corporations. (Thompson Reuters Tax and Accounting). 

Nice one American consumer, you are now going to pay at the shop for the tarrifs whilst the tax break given to the corporation you can be assured, will not be trickling down. Voodoo economics is a Reagan myth.

There may be an increase in domestic production in some sectors? Industries such as steel and aluminum may experience short-term gains due to reduced competition from imports. However, past experiences indicate that initial benefits can be offset by broader economic challenges, including retaliatory measures. (Reuters)

And so who's likely to have their faces adjusted by a big cat? 

The automotive sector. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico could disrupt the supply chain as the automotive industry is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on cross-border trade. 
Michigan - Ford and General Motors, Battleground State. Thank you Trump. 
South Carolina- BMW, Red State. Tennessee- Nissan. Red State. 
Kentucky- Ford, Red State.
Georgia - Kia, Red state.
Indiana - Subaru Red State.
Mississippi -Nissan, Red State.
Alabama- Mercedes US, Red State. 
Texas- Toyota and Tesla, Red State. 
California- Tesla, Blue State and that aint changing. 

Already, U.S. automotive manufacturers have expressed significant concerns regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adverse effects such measures could have on their operations and the broader industry.

General Motors analysts indicate that GM, could face substantial profit declines if a 25% tariff is imposed. The increased costs associated with these tariffs are likely to be passed on to consumers. (US News Money)

All them redneck semi-iliterate cowboy pickup lovers and factory workers will find out that Ram Trucks is projected to experience a significant reduction in annual core profits if the tariffs are implemented. The company may need to reassess its production strategies to mitigate the financial strain caused by increased import costs. (The Hill)

The additional costs incurred from tariffs are anticipated to be transferred to consumers, resulting in higher vehicle prices. This could lead to a decrease in demand, further impacting the financial performance of U.S. automakers. 

Yeeeehaww Grandmaw! Them majority red state employees might be getting their Xmas bonus delayed for a bit because you and I know, shareholder profits take precedence over the common folk.

What else will suffer?  Well them techbro Melon fanbois are not gunna be happy. Products such as electronics, apparel, and beauty items are expected to see price increases as companies pass on the additional costs of tariffs to consumers.  (Vogue Business)

The complex tech supply chains that rely on intricate global supply are unlikely to be duplicated in the United States, high labour costs compared to Mexico and China just ain't gonna let it happen. Look forward to paying two grand for your PS6 or $3K for your new NVIDIA RTX 5090 . Lol. Already inventories are being stockpiled but that ain't gonna last long. It's expected that sales will decline up to 68% (Signal AI)

Agriculture: Previous tariffs have resulted in retaliatory measures affecting U.S. agricultural exports. Farmers may face reduced market access with retaliation tarrifs and lower commodity prices, exacerbating financial strains within the agricultural community. (Reuters) Throw that into the fact your workforce has been incarcerated or are in hiding and that face is going to need more than hog shit to cover the mauling.

So who else has been regretting not voting, or voting for Trump? Well probably a pretty big percentage of low-income earners which, when you check out the stats overall, is in the majority, people in red States. Mississippi, a red state, poverty stands at 19.58%, making it the highest in the United States, while Louisiana, another red state, follows closely at 18.65%. In contrast, blue states like Massachusetts and New Jersey have significantly lower poverty rates of 8.5% and 8.2% (Visual Capitalist). 

And what goes along nicely with poverty? Medical issues. It's beautifully being played out in social media with so many rednecks saying that they're so glad Trump is going to get rid of Obamacare, but at least they'll still have the Affordable Care Act. As I write Trump has just recinded Biden's Executive Order lowering prescription drug prices under the ACA (Whitehouse.gov). What a choice now.... a carton of eggs or a half tablet of grannies heart medication? How fucking dumb do you have to be to vote yourself into medical bankruptcy or die because your too stupid to get past your exclusive Fox News consumption? You think Fucker Carlson ever gave a fuck about you? Maybe dig a little bit deeper to understand the nuances of things that you affect you and your kids before voting for your favourite orange thing.

Speaking of kids... You're going to be forced to have more, or just die whilst trying. Those state Republican legislatures are going to go full force in putting the lives of those unviable foetus' wellbeing above your daughter's, wife's or Mother's. Thanks Mitch and Trump for effectively stacking SCOTUS with Christian conservatives who overturned Roe. 

Already, sadly Trump voters have died. Josseli Barnica of Texas, suffering a miscarriage and dying of sepsis due to having Trump enabled abortion laws, or Nicole Thurman dying after being denied timely abortion care. (ProPublica)

That shits gonna be on steroids now. Trump enabled southern states, are looking at wider travel bans for pregnant women, with Texas already having put restrictions on travel to obtain abortions out of state (AP News). I hope that red voting Daddy is gunna be happy the meth head, that got his little girl up the stick, is gunna be hanging with him and Jr at Christmas soon. 

JD Vance, that guy who's going to be looking up at his two cybertruck chested daddies for the next 4 years, (the irony of this non nuclear family in the Whitehouse) has refrained from confirming or denying support for the right of pregnant women to leave the state for a termination of pregnancy (The independent). 

The University of Colorado Boulder projected that abortion bans could lead to a 24% increase in maternal mortality overall, with a 39% increase among non-Hispanic Black women. Also, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that in 2020, maternal death rates were 62% higher in states with abortion restrictions compared to those with greater access (28.8 vs. 17.8 per 100,000 births). This disparity is expected to widen post-Roe, as more states enact restrictive laws. (Home)

Time to lock up those red state daughters! Oh.... That would suite many anyway, because that's what it is about. Controlling women, not protecting a foetus. 

That's quite obvious when you look at the stats for dumped newborns post those Trump enabled SCOTUS changes. In Texas, since RvW was overturned, there was a 12.9% rise in infant mortality against the 1.8% rise over the rest of the country (JAMA Network) and at least 18 babies were deserted in 2024 alone in Texas (Yahoo News).

That's the Southern GOP/MAGA for you. Anyone that breaths air, not amniotic fluid, that doesn't earn at least the median wage, need to get a hold of them boot straps and start saving for that rainy day. You're on your own. Yep even if you voted for them.
So many other beautiful leopard stories. What about those that voted for peace because Trump is all about peace?

You didn't like the fact Biden didn't come down hard on Netanyahu? Thought Good ol TBone will step up? Lolz... That shit got settled before Biden left office (it will never be fully settled btw) and your complacency in voting has lead us to this. Peace? Despite being a violation of the Logan Act the orange sloth will try to take credit.

Step in ""America First"" AKA ""fuck the rest of the world"". Not even a ""If your not with us you're against us"". That's right. Melon and Trump have both been seeing a bit on the side. Putler who happens to be at odds with the rest of the civilised world.

That's a whole nother story and not a leopards tale. Mainly because anyone that respected Global Rule of Law would have the sense not to vote red. They probably read something other than their twitter feed whilst on the shitter. Remember that thing that Reagan stood for? Standing up to tyranny. No more of that shit now its follow the cash. Trumps been Putlers lapdog since the 80s (themoscowproject.org).

So Biden's sanctions on Russia have bought them to their knees. Not down and out. Putler has been waiting for his money launderer to take over and save him. Smoke and mirrors time.

Trump has already suggested using military or economic power to force Denmark to hand over the island (Reuters) with the Kremlin's Dmitry Peskov already likening it to Russia taking Crimea (justification for Russia).  Then there's Panama. He doesn't like the price of passage and the Chinese operating a port nearby, so that in his eyes, gives him authority to invade the country. (AP News) 

Feeling peaceful yet?

What about Canada? Thought it was a joke? Watch this space. It won't happen but the rhetoric gives a glimpse of the level of power he's looking for. He's praised Putin, Xi Jing Ping, Kim Jong il and Orban, despite concerns for their democratic principals or human rights records (International Business Times). 

Again as I write Mexical drug cartels are now terrorists according to him. Troops on Mexican soil next? Well they are heading to the border right?

If you were looking for peace, between starting trade wars, alienating Allies, supporting dictators, threatening military and economic annexation, yes your apathy or action has really made the world safer. Was Palestine your motivation for not voting blue? Watch this space and keep an eye out for those big cat spots.

And then there's the uneducated battler that just doesn't have the media savvy or is just to apethetic to look for more info. Cost of living? Price of eggs? Nice slight of hand you missed there. 

The promise to make things cheeper? Told you Biden is to blame for inflation? He would bring prices down? Then told Time magazine ""it's hard to bring things down once they are up"". Just remember that, in 4 years after the trade wars are in full swing.

Other Conservative outcry has been the prospective cabinet picks. 

Gaetz. The statutory rapist as investigated by his own party being found to have paid an underage girl $400 for sex and attending drug fuelled parties, paid $90k in payments for sex and drugs, obstructed congress investigations and tried to influence witnesses and also accepted impermissible gifts (AP News). Yep the GOP stood up to their own on that, (for other reasons not the debauchery), but nope the Orangeutang wanted him as the countries top prosecutor, that is, until he fell on his own sword. 

No worries. Let's replace him with someone who he can trust. Pam Bondi his impeachment lawyer who when questioned about birthright citizenship (of which Trump signed an EO on in the following week), she said she would have to go and research it (International Business Times). Ie I don't want to go against the boss so I'll play dumb or I just am unqualified?

Or what about those conservatives that are smacking their heads about the Antivaxer who is the head of Health, RFK?  Time for a reemergence of Polio? Or his desire to ban high fructose corn syrup? Those arse fucked farmers are going to be left wondering about that one too. 

Conservative veterans on the appointment of Pete Hegseth as Def Sec. Allegations of sexual assault (potentially a qualifying point) and alcohol abuse. But more importantly he was a fucking Major in the National Guard! (Wikipedia) What a qualification. Certainly a high flyer and exposed to international level politics there. Not.

Then there's another mate of Putin's. Tulsie Gubbard. Also of Bashar al-Assad. No intelligence community history but hey she's loyal, so let's put her as the Director of National Intelligence. Adept at parroting Russian disinformation (PBS), so maybe that was an endearing qualification? Her, despite a group of nearly 100 former national security officials urging the senate to ""carefully scrutinise"" her nomination. (The Hill) Ie... Don't do it.

Then there's DR OZ. The Medicare nom. Known for having promoted pseudoscience throughout his career. In 2015, a group of physicians called for his removal from the faculty at Columbia University, citing ""egregious lack of integrity"" in promoting ""quack treatments.""  (Looper) Maybe all those red voters can augment their removal of Medicare and Medicaid benifits with his green bean coffee extract, whilst the leopards feast.

All up the net worth of his cabinet is estimated to be nearly $500 billion. Double the GDP of countries of Greece or Hungary. ""Oh BoTh siDEs aRe the SaMe"" other conservatives reply. No... Biden's cabinet was $118 billion. (US News). The world sees an oligarchy forming. GROK agrees.(GROK)

Then there's another Putin contact. The ketamine addled Musk who we covered earlier. Conflict of interest central, who is already meddling in European politics, with France, Germany, Scotland, Norway and Spainish politicians criticising him (Reuters) for his Lex Luthor attitude and obvious world domination ambitions. 

Speaking of conflict of interest. Even tik tok has sparked the ire of the leopard mauled conservatives. After Trump pushed for its divestment by executive order in August 2020, on national security grounds, the ban being passed by the house to be enforced by 19 Jan 2025. Trump has extended the deadline by 75 days whilst Chinese officials consider the sale to Muskovite himself. Boom. Another Tennent of moving towards a facist dictatorship. Control of the media. But from what I see online the conservatives are mainly saying ban it already.

And still on Herr Musk... Another beautiful thing, is the wakeup call for the Conservatives is the concept of him being the ""free speech abolitionist"". The moment he took over Twitter the left were being blocked, shadow banned and demonetized. The right for years continued to talk of free speech. Nazism and bigotry became Twitter's future because of tgat free speech (of the right). He blocked the ability to block content from your own feed that you didn't like. The EU investigated his manipulation of far right party posts during elections (Reuters). But for the Conservatives... It only becomes an issue when they are banned. And banned they have been now. The H-1B visas have pissed so many off, that they are coming out in droves. Take a sip from that cup of shut the fuck up he's told them. They don't like it. 

The potentially most significant tech hiccup came when tech streamer Asmongold called him out for cheating on Path of Exile 2.

Muskovite did a live stream of him playing PoE2 and despite having a high level and good kit was walking past valuable items seemingly oblivious of their value. Asmongold called him out for potentially account sharing or outsourcing advancement. Musk didn't like this and released private DM with Asmongold in order to deligitimise him. This riled up the techheads. Notably not all potential leopard victims.  Asmongold was  highlighting this off the back of Melon bragging previously, as being one of the top Diablo gamers of which others thought suss also. (The verge) The tech bros are now pushing back and could that be a big part of his future downfall? 

Another thing the tech bros are livid online about is Trump and crypto. Fucking Musk and his manipulation with DOGE coin already, but it seems as usual, Trump in his Dunning Kruger perpetual state, has learnt about crypto... Great for money laundering it seems. So in a massive conflict of interest he launched the Trump Coin followed by the Melania Meme Coin. 

Crypto coins are really cheap to startup. Can be as low as $500 to get it underway. Then the speculative market takes over. This can be exploited with what they call a ""pump and dump"". Basically the initiators buy the initial coin en mass when worth nothing then others jump on-board to buy their own and the price goes up. The initial investors make massive profits at the expense of others by dumping the bulk and dropping the price.

Trump dropped his coin on the market the day before inauguration. Confliiiiiict? 80% of the initial investors were Trump affiliated orgs. (Wired). Within hours of release the price surged to $75.35 from 18c. A $13 billion market capitalisation. (News). Former Trump Aide Scaramucci described it as ""corruption"".(Newsweek). Within a couple of days it's now trading at 95c.(Coin Geko). It looks like the master of grift has done it again. I'd put my left nut on the line, to say not one of those first 80% hold any coin at all, in any quantity. 

This is where the tech bros offered a lovely face delicacy to the cat. The didn't vote it on them selves, they backed the super grifter with their own hard earned cash... And lost. So pretty to see.

So what else have the leopards been feeding on? Well the 200,000 supporters that forked out to travel to DC then to find it was to be moved in doors are more than a little miffed. After spending months complaining about the price of eggs, then forking out thousands of greenbacks to get there...  Cited as a weather move indoors, MAGA pundits were left watching the oligarchs closest and newest supporters soaking up the indoor heat. Weather? Maybe it was just that small crowd size fear again? It was cold... But not an unprecedented temp. Wind chill of 5°F (-15°c). Regan's outdoor event was wind chill of -10°F (-23°c). I think Trump was as afraid of the smallness just like Stormy was of his. 

Then there's the event organisers who still haven't been paid. They aren't posting but the memes and news reports out there are exposing the full grift that is DJT.(See attached).

All in all, new reasons to have ones face ripped off by a leopard are popping up every couple of hours it seems. We will really see the extent in the coming years. 

Some of us will be immune. Many won't. For those that did the right thing its a sad situation. For those that were apathetic or actively supporting the future racist you can get fucked. You suffered from arrogance or ignorance and neither are an excuse for what is now going to transpire.

I have not even touched a criticism of this oligarchy, if I were to do that, I would never finish it. The Moscow connection, the lies, the manipulations, the backstabbing and the childish thin skinned selfish self serving, narcissistic escapades would run on too long. 

I have picked a few reactions to the bait and switch, the media manipulation and the grift. 

We can only hope that democracy survives, peace and the global rule of law remains intact and another lesson is learnt not to be forgotten for a long time. "

""We must stand and fight!"" A visibly fuming Hadid smashed his fists onto the table. His face, previously light and almost pale, was red as blood threatened to burst from his arteries. 

""And who will fight with us when you have killed every Christian and Druze from the Golan to Iran? Who will follow you when the only path is death? Who will follow you when your fight leads to the end of this movement?"" A furious Hawwa responded. Spittle flew out from his mouth as his moderates jeered and booed an increasingly spiraling Hadid. 

""Any who do not dare to fight the regime of Hafez al-Assad I declare to be a traitor to Allah first, and a coward the second!"" His supporters cheered. His opposition retorted with insults. This had been the state of the conference for the past hour as radicals battled the moderates, led ostensibly by Sa'id Ḥawwa. In the meantime, Issam al-Attar, Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, who had risked so much to arrange this meeting and ensure it was safe from the Mukhbarat could only pray the meeting did not end in blood. Suddenly, he stood up and raised a hand for the room to silence. 

""When we convened for morning prayers, I asked each and every one of you if you were committed to our cause."" He looked to each side of the room. ""Each of you made a vow to Allah. I ask you right now, where is that oath now?"" 

His voice, not sounding as if it came from an old man, carried the weight of one. The room's silence grew increasingly tense, as both camps looked downwards, unable to meet their leader's harsh gaze. Attar took another breath, and spoke again. ""We risk everything by meeting here today. Do you not think the Mukhbarat savours this opportunity? To murder and assassinate our brothers? We are all here, on the land of our colonizers, despite that risk to settle how we shall conduct the will of Allah and liberate Syria from its secular dictatorship."" He once again sat down and looked to his two primary lieutenants. 

""Since we last met two weeks prior, much has changed. Marwan Hadid and Sa'id Ḥawwa. I wish for you both to deliver a report on the latest activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and our communist allies."" 

Hawwa jumped up immediately. ""Great Guide. We are steadily growing in membership all around Syria. Al-Assad's policies have not been able to fully suppress the righteous anger our people feel at his rule. I have also been in contact with our Communist allies, who repo-""

""FAILURE! They report failure!"" Hadid interrupted. The conference fell deadly silent. 

""I hold aloft here a newspaper report from the Associated Press. Enver Hoxha has turned on the Communists and ejected them from one of two allies they have claimed to be able to influence to our cause. They flee like rats to whoever will offer them room in their home. Tell me, Hawwa, how is our alliance that you so championed doing?"" 

""Lies! This cannot be true!"" Hawwa looked almost panicked as whispers passed through the room like a quick wind. 

""Great Guide, in contrast to Hawwa's failures, the Fighting Vanguard remains prepared to launch a violent response to Hafez's aggression. Despite setbacks to our networks in Lebanon, weapons continue to flow. Our followers, as well as their devotion, increases. We have the money, manpower, and equipment to pursue Allah's will. Unlike Hawwa's folly, we need no allies.""Hadid smiled slyly as his supporters were buoyed. In contrast, Hawwa could only slump into his chair and hastily discuss the new developments with his lieutenants. He had been thoroughly outmaneuvered. 

""Great Guide, what Hadid says is no doubt true, but the reality of our predicament does not change. What he will not tell you is that Hafez continues to modernize his army units, and our support is not yet great enough to launch a great revolt. Our best strategy forward is to wait for Hafez to make a mistake, secure the commitment of the ulama, and gain legitimacy as oppos-."" 

""Whilst Hawwa plays politics, the plight of Syrians only continues to deteriorate. Are we to let the opportunity slip through our fingers now to pursue the \*hope\* of something bet-""

Issam al-Attar, Great Guide and General Leader of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood rose his hand suddenly in silence. The conference, followed shortly after by Hadid and Hawwa fell silent as mice. 

""Enough of this squabbling. In lieu of this conference being unable to come to a conclusion, I exercise my right to guide it."" He took a deep breath. ""We maintain our peaceful course for now. Yes, the setbacks in Albania are regrettable, but it is no use to cut the fruit whilst it still could grow. This shall be the path of our brotherhood for the near future.

Hawwa breathed a sigh of relief and practically collapsed into his seat. For now, the Muslim Brotherhood would survive. That's how he saw it at least. He would have slightly more time to attempt and recoup his losses. The Communists would also remain in the fold. Hadid meanwhile couldn't believe it. He forced himself to sit and  breathe, barely containing his frothing rage. His followers fell in line, but his heart just could not. After the membership had dispersed, he promptly stormed out.

What would count as proof to you?,Christianity,1i6vyot,2025-01-21 17:57:08,4,0.75,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i6vyot/what_would_count_as_proof_to_you/,Misplacedwaffle,,"Obviously there are very few complicated world views that can be changed by once piece of evidence. Most often several pieces of solid converging data are needed to create a full picture. With that in mind, to the unbelievers, what specific pieces of evidence to you think would help verify the supernatural and religious claims of the Bible and Christianity? I have written 5 that I think would count as strong evidence (some not religion specific, but like I said, only a piece of the puzzle for each proof), but I am wondering what others think. 

1: Proof of the human soul. - thus far, all evidence points to personality and thought being attached to brain chemistry. Loss of the brain erases the person. Damage to the brain or alterations to the brain chemistry through drugs have notable changes to the person that seem to indicate that who a person is is determine by the physical state. Proof that there is something more enduring and untouchable by physical means would add credibility to religious claims. 

2: Proof that prayer has a healing effect beyond what we would expect from a close social network or positive thinking. - This would be particularly easy to test by having a control group of sick atheists with a strong network of friends vs a group of sick church people. 

3: Corroborating texts of impressive Biblical claims from non Christian sources. - examples: 

A. The book of Matthew states that after the death of Jesus, holy men rose from their graves and appeared to many in Jerusalem. Written accounts from Roman authorities talking about this event and trying to deal with the chaos would be good evidence in the accuracy of the event. 

B. Assuming a literal large Israelite exodus from Egypt. Evidence from Egyptian records of economic hardship from losing a working population of 2 million or from the 10 plagues would be extremely convincing. Even more so if we found records of the 10 plagues from their perspective. 

4. Accurate and unambiguous prophecy that is clearly demonstrated with a specific time limit - either from text that was discovered and clearly identified is written before events or made now with an impressive prediction (This one people will argue we have, probably). 

5. Scientifically testable miracles of any kind. - If miracles are expected to be believed in the Bible, it would add credibility to know that such things are possible today. Being performed in controlled conditions would be more convincing than the anecdotal claims some people report.

The Last Lightkeeper (a spiritual tale),True_Spiritual_Seek,1i6uhl1,2025-01-21 16:54:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/True_Spiritual_Seek/comments/1i6uhl1/the_last_lightkeeper_a_spiritual_tale/,Perfect_Location_245,,"# The World Beyond Time

In the year 3125, Earth was no longer a planet of oceans and forests but a memory etched into the collective consciousness of humanity. The cradle of civilization had been abandoned centuries ago, its surface rendered inhospitable by the relentless march of progress. In its place, humanity had built an empire among the stars — a latticework of interconnected cities suspended in orbit around the sun. These cities, known as the Solarian Spires, were marvels of engineering: vast habitats that shimmered like jewels against the black canvas of space.

At the heart of this celestial network burned the Corelight, a source of energy so potent and enigmatic that it seemed to defy natural law. Discovered in an age long forgotten, it was said to be eternal — an unyielding beacon that powered every city and sustained every life. Its glow was omnipresent, casting a golden hue over all things. To many, it was more than technology; it was divinity incarnate.

But with this light came shadows — shadows not cast by objects but by the human soul. As humanity ascended technologically, it descended spiritually. The Corelight became an idol worshipped with fervor. Temples were erected around its radiance; hymns were sung to its hum. People whispered prayers not to gods or ancestors but to this artificial flame that never wavered.

Yet there were those who questioned this blind devotion — though they did so only in hushed tones for fear of exile or worse. Among them was an elder philosopher named Kaelus, whose writings had been banned for their heretical ideas about balance and humility.

“Do you not see?” he once wrote before his disappearance. “The Corelight blinds us — not with brilliance but with complacency.”

Within Lumora Citadel — the largest and most radiant of all human settlements — lived a solitary figure known only as the Lightkeeper. His role was sacred yet isolating: to tend to the Corelight’s mechanisms and ensure its uninterrupted glow.

One evening during his rounds, he paused before the great chamber where the Corelight burned brightest — a sphere of pure energy suspended within a crystalline lattice.

“Why do you shine so endlessly?” he murmured aloud, though no one could hear him in his solitude.

To his astonishment, a voice seemed to answer — not from outside but within his own mind.

“Do I shine for you,” it asked softly, “or do you merely refuse to look away?”

The Lightkeeper froze, unsure if he had imagined it or if something deeper stirred within him — a question he would soon find impossible to ignore.

# The Flicker

One evening, as the Lightkeeper performed his routine inspections, the Corelight faltered. It was not a failure in the mechanical sense — no grinding of gears, no ruptured conduits — but a flicker, brief yet undeniable. For an instant, its brilliance dimmed, casting shadows across the vast chamber where it had burned unwaveringly for centuries. The Lightkeeper froze mid-step, his breath caught in his chest. He had read every manual, memorized every protocol; nowhere was there mention of such an event.

The flicker lasted less than a heartbeat, but its implications rippled outward like a stone dropped into still water. Within moments, alarms blared across Lumora Citadel. Citizens poured into the streets in panic, their faces illuminated by the Corelight’s uneven glow. Priests gathered at its temples to chant prayers of restoration while engineers scrambled to diagnose what they assumed must be a technical fault.

But within the chamber itself, silence reigned. The Lightkeeper stood alone before the pulsating heart of humanity’s existence. He reached out instinctively to touch one of its crystalline panels, feeling its warmth beneath his fingertips. “Why?” he whispered aloud to no one in particular.

And then it came — a voice, soft yet resonant, not from outside but within him.

“Do you see now?”

The Lightkeeper staggered back as if struck. “Who speaks?” he demanded aloud, though his voice trembled with uncertainty.

“I am what you have forgotten,” replied the voice calmly. It was neither male nor female but carried an ageless quality that seemed to echo through his very being.

“What do you mean? Forgotten what?” His words were sharp now, tinged with fear and frustration.

“The stars,” said the voice simply. “The infinite beyond your light.”

The Lightkeeper felt something stir deep within him — a memory long buried beneath years of servitude and solitude. He recalled faint images from his childhood: lying on a grassy hill under an open sky filled with countless stars before he had been taken to serve the Corelight. Those stars had once been humanity’s guide and inspiration; now they were obscured by artificial radiance.

“This cannot be,” he murmured to himself as he turned away from the Corelight and made his way toward Lumora’s observation deck — a place he rarely visited due to his duties’ demands.

When he arrived there and gazed out into space for what felt like the first time in decades, he saw them: stars scattered like diamonds across an endless velvet expanse. They shimmered faintly against the backdrop of eternity — ancient fires burning with quiet indifference to humanity’s creations.

For a moment longer than he could measure, he stood transfixed by their beauty and their silence.

“Why have you shown me this?” he asked aloud again.

“To remind you,” said the voice within him gently. “Light is not meant to blind — it is meant to reveal.”

The words struck him like thunderclaps in his mind. Had humanity misunderstood their own creation? Had they traded true illumination — the wisdom found in balance — for dependence on this singular source?

As these thoughts churned within him like storm-tossed waves, another question arose unbidden: What if this flicker was not a failure but a message? And if so…from whom?

He returned slowly to the Corelight chamber that night with more questions than answers but carrying within him something new: doubt — not about himself or even his role but about everything humanity had come to believe about their light and their place in existence.

And for the first time since taking up his post nearly fifty years prior, doubt felt less like weakness and more like awakening.

# The Journey Within

The Lightkeeper, once steadfast in his purpose, now found himself consumed by doubt. The flicker of the Corelight had awakened something dormant within him — a yearning for answers that no manual or scripture could provide. For decades, he had lived in service to the light, believing it to be the pinnacle of human achievement and the source of all meaning. Yet now, as he walked the silent halls of Lumora Citadel, its glow seemed cold and hollow, a pale imitation of something far greater.

He descended into the archives — vast chambers buried deep within the citadel’s foundations, where knowledge from centuries past lay entombed in dust and neglect. Few ventured here; the pursuit of ancient wisdom had long been abandoned in favor of technological progress. The Lightkeeper moved through rows of forgotten texts and digital records, his fingers brushing against brittle pages and dimly glowing data tablets.

Hours turned to days as he immersed himself in humanity’s lost philosophies. He read of civilizations that had risen and fallen, each leaving behind warnings about hubris and imbalance. One passage from an ancient philosopher struck him deeply: *“To worship what we create is to forget what created us.”* Another text spoke of light not as an end but as a means — a tool to illuminate paths yet unseen.

As he read, questions began to form like cracks in his once-solid beliefs. Was the Corelight truly eternal? Or was it merely another construct destined to fade? Had humanity’s obsession with its brilliance blinded them to other truths?

One evening, amidst his search, he came across a holographic recording — a message left by a previous Lightkeeper centuries ago. The figure was gaunt and weary but spoke with quiet conviction.

*“If you are watching this,”* said the figure, *“then perhaps you too have felt it — the emptiness beneath the glow. We were meant to tend this light, yes — but not to worship it. Look beyond it. Seek what lies hidden in shadow.”*

The words resonated deeply within him. That night, as he meditated before the Corelight, he spoke aloud for the first time since his awakening.

“What are you?” he asked the radiant energy before him.

The Corelight pulsed faintly in response — not with sound but with a presence that filled the chamber.

“I am what you made me,” came a voice — not external but internal, echoing within his mind like ripples on still water.

“And what lies beyond you?” he pressed.

“Only what you dare to seek.”

The Lightkeeper sat in silence for hours after this exchange, grappling with its meaning. He realized then that his journey was not merely one of discovery but also one of courage — the courage to question what others accepted without thought and to venture into realms unknown.

When he emerged from the archives days later, his eyes carried a new clarity — a spark not born of artificial light but of something deeper: an understanding that true illumination required both inquiry and humility.

# The Choice

As the Lightkeeper’s fiftieth year approached — the moment when he would relinquish his post to a successor — he found himself consumed by an inner conflict that no manual or teaching could resolve. For decades, he had served the Corelight with unwavering devotion, believing it to be humanity’s salvation and purpose. Yet now, the flicker had awakened something within him — a question that refused to be silenced: Was this light truly eternal, or was it merely a reflection of humanity’s fear of the unknown?

One evening, as the Corelight hummed softly in its chamber, he stood before it in solitude. Its radiance filled the room, casting long shadows behind him. He spoke aloud, his voice trembling with both reverence and defiance.

“Are you alive?” he asked, his words echoing in the vast chamber. “Or are you just a machine — a mirror for our desires?”

The Corelight offered no reply, yet in its silence, he felt an answer stirring within himself. He sank to his knees, pressing his hands against the cold floor as if seeking grounding from the weight of his thoughts.

Moments later, a voice emerged — not from the Corelight but from deep within his own mind. It was calm yet piercing, like a whisper carried on an ancient wind.

“You ask if I am alive,” it said. “But have you asked if *you* are?”

The Lightkeeper froze. “What do you mean?” he whispered.

“You have spent your life tending me,” the voice continued. “You have given me your time, your faith, your soul. But tell me this: When did you last tend to yourself? When did you last look beyond my glow and into the infinite?”

He clenched his fists as tears welled in his eyes. “I was chosen for this duty! I had no choice but to serve!”

“Choice is not given,” replied the voice gently. “It is made.”

The words struck him like thunder. For years, he had believed himself bound by fate — an instrument of necessity rather than agency. But now he saw that even within duty lay freedom: the freedom to question, to decide.

In that moment of clarity, he rose and approached the Corelight’s central mechanism — a labyrinthine console of levers and circuits that pulsed with energy. His hands hovered over its controls as doubt clawed at him.

“What will happen if I let it dim?” he murmured aloud.

“You fear their anger,” said the voice within him again. “But what you should fear more is their stagnation.”

He closed his eyes and imagined humanity’s cities bathed not in artificial brilliance but in starlight — the ancient glow that had once inspired wonder and humility alike. He imagined people looking up at those distant fires and remembering their smallness amidst an infinite cosmos.

With steady hands, he deactivated one section of the Corelight’s mechanism — not enough to extinguish it entirely but sufficient to cause periodic dimming across all celestial cities.

As alarms blared throughout Lumora Citadel, officials stormed into the chamber demanding answers.

“What have you done?” cried one elder angrily.

The Lightkeeper turned to face them with calm resolve etched into his features. “I have given us back our darkness,” he said simply.

“Darkness? You would plunge us into chaos!” another shouted.

“No,” replied the Lightkeeper firmly. “I would remind us of what we’ve forgotten — that light has meaning only because shadow exists beside it.”

His words hung heavy in the air as silence fell over those gathered around him. Some looked at him with fury; others with confusion; a few with quiet understanding.

And so began humanity’s reckoning — not through destruction but through rediscovery: a flicker that forced them to pause and remember what they had lost in their pursuit of endless illumination — the wisdom found not just in light but also in shadow’s embrace.

# The Awakening

The first flicker of the Corelight was met with unease. Across the celestial cities, people paused in their routines, staring at the dimming glow that had never faltered before. For a brief moment, silence fell over humanity’s sprawling habitats as the ever-present hum of energy faded into stillness. Then, as if on cue, the stars emerged — pinpricks of ancient light piercing through the artificial haze that had long obscured them.

In Lumora Citadel’s central square, a child tugged at her mother’s sleeve and pointed upward. “What are those?” she asked, her voice filled with wonder.

Her mother hesitated, gazing at the unfamiliar sight above. “They’re… stars,” she whispered, though the word felt foreign on her tongue. She realized then that she had never truly seen them before — not like this.

As the flickers became more frequent, what began as fear transformed into curiosity. People gathered beneath transparent domes during each dimming to witness the spectacle of unfiltered space. At first, they spoke in hushed tones, uncertain how to interpret this newfound darkness. But soon, conversations blossomed — questions were asked and stories shared.

One evening during a particularly long flicker, an elder addressed a crowd gathered in Lumora’s amphitheater. His voice trembled not with age but with emotion: “Do you see? This is what we have forgotten — the vastness beyond our walls and wires. We built these cities to escape darkness, yet it is in darkness that we find perspective.”

A young engineer stood and challenged him: “But without the Corelight, we would be lost! It powers everything — it *is* everything.”

The elder smiled gently and replied, “Is it? Or have we made it so because we feared what lies beyond its glow? Look around you now — are you not alive in this moment without it?”

Another voice chimed in from the crowd — a poet who had long struggled to find inspiration amidst Lumora’s sterile brilliance: “The stars… they remind us that we are small but not insignificant. They burn with no need for worship or maintenance — they simply *are*. Perhaps we too must learn to simply *be*.”

These dialogues spread like wildfire across humanity’s interconnected cities. Philosophers debated whether reliance on artificial light had dulled humanity’s inner vision — the ability to reflect on existence itself. Artists began painting scenes of starlit skies and shadowed landscapes once thought obsolete. Scientists turned their attention outward again, seeking knowledge not just within their controlled environments but among the distant galaxies.

Even children played games inspired by constellations they now saw for the first time — tracing patterns in the sky and imagining stories behind each twinkling point of light.

In time, humanity came to embrace these moments of darkness as opportunities for connection — not only with one another but also with something greater than themselves. During each flicker, families gathered together under open skies; strangers became friends as they shared telescopes and tales; prayers were whispered not to machines but to whatever force had set those ancient stars ablaze.

One night, a young girl approached an aging Lightkeeper who sat quietly beneath Lumora’s dome after his retirement. She looked up at him with wide eyes and asked softly: “Why does it flicker?”

He smiled — a smile filled with both sorrow and hope — and replied: “Because sometimes we must lose sight of what we think is essential… to remember what truly is.”

And so humanity awakened — not through conquest or invention but through humility and wonder. They learned anew that light is most meaningful when balanced by shadow; that progress is hollow without purpose; and that even amidst infinite technology lies an eternal truth: To see clearly requires both illumination… and darkness.

A few days back I posted about an old hard drive that I supposedly had had repaired and which had been broken since around 2005. The following list is what I found on it apart from stuff I already know are on either studio albums or live albums. Some sneaky songs might have camouflaged themselves and ended up among the others and it's entirely possible that none of these files are interesting at all. I just wanted to get some one else's opinion on the matter since there might be something of vague interest here. My favorite is the ""first ever live"" version of august and everything after, since I remember all the commotion about it when it resurfaced back in the forum days on countingcrows.com.

Please let me know if there seems to be anything of interest here and also tell me if I might be in trouble for even claiming to own all these files. I tried to create a username on crows-town.com but I must be stupid cause I can't log in... Some one said they might be interested.

# OVERWATCH 2 PATCH NOTES – JANUARY 21, 2025

# YEAR OF THE SNAKE SEASONAL EVENT

Celebrate the Lunar New Year - Year of the Snake - in Overwatch 2 with the return of Mischief & Magic, a festive game mode that blends strategy, stealth, and skill along with Bounty Hunter and Capture the Flag. Complete event challenges to unlock exclusive rewards, including Lunar New Year-themed cosmetics that capture the joy and vibrancy of the season. Don’t miss your chance to outwit, outplay, and outlast your opponents!

# VALENTINE’S DAY 2025

Take aim and fall in love again with the return of the Love of Geometry game mode. This team Deathmatch brawl pits teams of four Cupid Hanzos against each other. Be sure to watch out as hiding around corners is not safe as everyone can use the original Scatter Arrow ability for Hanzo. This is an event that you’ll fall in love with again as it runs from February 4 to February 18.

# 6V6 EXPERIMENTAL - MINIMUM 1, MAXIMUM 3

Step back into Overwatch’s origins even more with a fresh twist on the beloved six-player team format. The 6v6 Min 1, Max 3 Mode is a unique experiment that blends nostalgia with modern gameplay dynamics, offering a structured composition alongside the flexibility to switch roles mid-match. And your participation in this experiment will help shape the future of Overwatch 2’s gameplay—so don’t miss this chance to leave your mark.

* Heroes are selected first come, first serve.
* Each team must have at least one hero from all three roles, but cannot have more than three heroes from any given role.
* Players can switch between roles while in the spawn room.
* Hero balance for this experiment uses the same hero balance from the 6v6 2-2-2 Role Queue experiment.
* This game mode is available to play in Unranked from January 21 to February 3.

# OVERWATCH CLASSIC - MOTH META

Overwatch Classic - Moth Meta brings you back to one of the most iconic and chaotic chapters in Overwatch history. Mercy’s legendary “Moth” gameplay takes the spotlight as her lightning-fast Resurrects redefine team fights, while heroes like DPS Doomfist and Symmetra with her Shield Generator make a triumphant return to the battlefield. Step onto beloved maps Oasis, Eichenwalde, and Junkertown, where every skirmish is packed with nostalgic strategies and unpredictable mayhem.

* Heroes added include Ana, Sombra, Orisa, and Doomfist.
* Maps added include Eichenwalde, Oasis, Horizon Lunar Colony, and Junkertown.
* Hero balance is adjusted to the September 2017 Hero Balance.

# NEW MYTHIC WEAPON - ASHE'S LEAD ROSE

Our latest Mythic Weapon is Ashe's Lead Rose. Growing up in the Lead Rose Manor, Ashe was expected to be the perfect daughter. But while her parents had hoped for a flawless rose, they never expected Ashe's thorns. Like Ashe, this weapon is both beautiful and lethal. The more Ashe embraces her rebellious nature by earning eliminations, the more she blooms into the person she was meant to be! At level one, players will unlock her base Mythic weapon. Level two unlocks reactivity and the Mythic HUD. The beloved flourish is on Level Three which allows Ashe to tauntingly toss a rose at her opponents. And Level Four is the elimination effects, exploding enemies in a burst of rose petals.

# COMPETITIVE UPDATES

COMPETITIVE DRIVES

* A new Drives signature is available to earn from February 11 to February 16
* Players can now earn up to 6,000 Competitive Points by completing Competitive Drive Stages, enough to unlock 2 Jade or Golden Weapon Variants.

COMPETITIVE REWARDS

As the 2024 Competitive Year concludes, Season 14 is the last chance to redeem Competitive Points for Jade Weapon Variants. After Season 14 is complete, any accumulated Competitive Points will be converted to Legacy Competitive Points which can be redeemed for Golden Weapon Variants. Jade Weapon Variants will not be available to collect starting in Season 15.

# HERO UPDATES

These hero balance updates only apply to our standard game modes and not the 6v6 Experiment or Overwatch Classic.

# TANK

# Ramattra

Developer Comment: Ramattra has been underperforming relative to other brawl tanks. Adding a small increase to his armor will provide a necessary boost without altering his core gameplay.

* Base Armor increased from 75 to 100

# Winston

Developer Comment: Winston's dive potential has been impacted by the increased health pools of enemies. By boosting the damage of the Tesla Cannon's secondary fire and providing more ammo, this will allow Winston to follow up and finish off enemies without needing to reload as often.

Tesla Cannon

* Ammo increased from 100 to 120
* Secondary fire max charge damage increased from 50 to 60

Primal Rage

* Ultimate ability cost increased by 12%

# Hazard

Developer Comment: We’re finding our newest tank’s mobility to be a little too hazardous. By decreasing Violent Leap’s cooldown, Hazard will have to be more selective with how he dives into the opponent backlines.

Violent Leap

* Violent Leap cooldown increased from 5 to 6 seconds.

# DAMAGE

# Echo

Developer Comment: Echo has been slightly underperforming recently, so we are increasing the base damage of the Focusing Beam. This change will make it easier to push enemies into the critical health threshold.

Focusing Beam

* Damage-per-second on targets above 50% HP increased from 50 to 75.

# Tracer

Developer Comment: Tracer has remained less threatening since the damage reduction to her Pulse Pistols. Reducing their spread will make her damage more consistent at slightly longer ranges.

Pulse Pistols

* Spread decreased by 15%

# SUPPORT

# Ana

Developer Comment: Recent changes to her rifle have made Ana a highly impactful support. Reducing the damage of her Biotic Grenade will adjust some of her breakpoints and slightly affect her self-sustainability.

Biotic Grenade

* Explosion damage and healing decreased from 90 to 75.

# Illari

Developer Comment: lllari can struggle to heal allies without her Healing Pylon. Increasing the maximum resource of her secondary fire will allow her to support her team more effectively during those moments.

Solar Rifle

Secondary Fire Maximum resource increased from 3 to 3.5 seconds.

# Juno

Developer Comment: Juno’s ultimate remains too powerful when used effectively by her allies. Reducing both the duration and damage amplification will reduce the potency of the ultimate.

Orbital Ray

* Duration reduced from 10 to 8 seconds
* Damage amplification reduced from 35% to 30%

# BUG FIXES

GENERAL

* Fixed an issue where competitive titles will sometimes unequip after a logout.

MAPS

Circuit Royal

* Fixed an issue which now prevents turrets from being placed inside the sportscars.

HEROES

Bastion

* Fixed in previous release, fixed an issue causing Bastion's Ultimate to not have impact sounds or VFX.

Hazard

* Fixed an issue where Hazard's Jagged Wall projectiles would pass through certain player made objects such as Cryo-Freeze, Ice Wall, Petal Platform.

Sombra

* Fixed an issue where Sombra's EMP can sometimes fail to hit opponents if they had previously interacted with Jagged Wall.

Zenyatta

* Fixed an issue causing Zenyatta to T-Pose with the ""Retro Hero"" emote."

Tesla Company Analysis Report,UniversityNetwork,1i6nq1m,2025-01-21 12:19:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityNetwork/comments/1i6nq1m/tesla_company_analysis_report/,oivezasluvrsgo,,"## Tesla’s Internal Resources and Competencies

Tesla is one of the leading producers of electric cars and components in the world. To examine internal factors contributing to the development of the competitive advantage, it is necessary to employ the concept of the core competencies. Core competencies are “the bases upon which an organization… distinguishes from competitors” (Johnson, Scholes & Whittington 2008, p. 13).

As for the internal resources and competencies that became the company’s competitive advantage, it is possible to note that the use of “a single manufacturer system” monitoring performance and providing remote services have contributed greatly to Tesla’s development (Porter & Heppelmann 2014, p. 5). This connectedness enables the company to reduce costs and ensure the continuous flow of resources. The company produces vehicles at reasonable prices, but their cars can surmount larger distances compared to Tesla’s competitors. This is one of the major competitive advantages of the company.

The focus on innovation is another peculiarity and core competence that can allow Tesla to remain a top manufacturer of electric cars. It is necessary to add that the company patented hundreds of innovations that make it the leader in the industry. The company sells components to many companies developing effective alliances. The innovative approach has enabled Tesla to be more competitive than its peers. For instance, the company does not simply promise a smaller negative footprint but offers a “net positive” impact (Laszlo 2015, p. 103). More so, the company was one of the producers of such cars, which is also its competitive advantage as the corresponding image is created.

The use of sophisticated and effective software is another competence creating a competitive advantage for the company. Tesla products can be characterized by the latest advances in technology as their vehicles are equipped with software that enables the driver to receive a wide range of data, which makes the driving experience easy and enjoyable (Porter & Heppelmann 2014). For instance, apart from the ability to control various processes such as motor functioning or battery voltage management, each vehicle can be connected to the owner’s mobile device, which is rather popular among consumers.

Finally, the company uses effective strategies to maintain its leading position. For instance, Tesla is sharing some of its technological advances and innovations with its competitors (Schulze, MacDuffie & Taube 2015). More so, the company also shares its charging infrastructure (which is one of its competitive advantages) with its competitors. It is clear that this strategy may lead to some short-term losses but will result in significant benefits for Tesla in the long run. The company will create a set of specific standards its competitors will have to comply with, which will help Tesla remain the leader in the industry.

Therefore, Tesla’s major resources and competences are connectedness, innovation, knowledge. The company produces electric cars that are operated with the help of sophisticated software, which makes driving enjoyable and quite multifaceted. The car manufacturer’s charging network is extensive, which also creates a competitive advantage. The use of effective strategies has led to the accumulation of significant resources that, in their turn, contributed to the creation of competitive advantage.

## External Environment and Tesla’s Entrepreneurial Activities

To consider Tesla’s entrepreneurial activities and the way they are affected by the external environment, it is necessary to define the concept. There are various definitions of the term, but the major characteristic feature of the entrepreneurial activity mentioned by scholars is the focus on innovation, new products, and business opportunities (Bessant & Tidd 2011).

It has already been acknowledged that the automotive industry is changing significantly as fuel-driven cars are being slowly replaced by electric vehicles. Calabrese (2016) emphasizes that the future of electric cars is bright even though oil barons still have significant power over the automotive industry. Governments start investing more in environmentally-friendly technologies as they try to address various environmental issues. Besides, the comparative scarcity of fossil fuels has forced people to consider alternative ways to obtain energy and use it.

The modern automotive industry is characterized by the focus on innovation and addressing particular needs.

For instance, Priestley (2015) states that driverless cars are the future of the industry, and Tesla is one of the companies working in this direction. Some researchers and practitioners expect these types of vehicles to be dominant between 2020 and 2040 (Priestley 2015). This trend can facilitate the development of the entrepreneurial activities of Tesla as the company is quite ready for such innovations. Tesla already has powerful batteries as well as efficient software. It also has the necessary experience in developing successful partnerships, which is important for the development of the company. It is possible to use the PESTLE framework to analyze external factors (see Figure 1).

As has been mentioned above, governments support environmentally sustainable technologies, which is an important factor contributing to the development of entrepreneurial activities of the company. For instance, the US government has launched a variety of incentives that support producers of environmentally-friendly products, such as cars with low or zero emissions of hazardous gases (Karamitsios 2013). These incentives include funding of various projects, additional benefits for manufacturers, assistance in the development of the charging infrastructure, and so on. Interestingly, governmental incentives are also addressed at consumers who can receive loans from the government or even get a vehicle as a present or some kind of benefit.

This factor has a significant positive effect on the development of the company that can receive some funding. More importantly, the market is increasing, and electric vehicles are becoming consumers’ choices. Electric cars are becoming a norm, and Tesla is regarded as one of the pioneers and major innovators in the industry. These are favorable factors for the development of the company, and Tesla can continue its development of innovative products. It is necessary to note that when using Porter’s Five Forces, it is clear that the company’s external environment is associated with certain risks as the buyer power and threat of substitution are high (see figure 2).

Therefore, it is possible to note that Tesla is in a favorable environment as the automotive industry is changing, and these transformations are the focus of the company. Thus, the development and use of environmentally-friendly products can be regarded as major concerns of governments, companies, and customers. More so, people seek for innovation and are ready for such novelties as driverless cars. All these changes positively affect the company’s entrepreneurial activity as Tesla is capable of addressing the needs and wants of customers.

## Strategic Choices

Tesla is one of the leading manufacturers of electric cars and components in the world. One of the reasons for this success is the focus on entrepreneurial concepts (innovation, new business opportunities, and so on). The company may choose various strategies to increase its entrepreneurial opportunities. It is possible to analyze two strategic choices the organization can make to achieve this aim. To ensure these strategies’ effectiveness, it is necessary to apply SAF criteria.

One of the possible ways to continue Tesla’s entrepreneurial activities is to invest in the development of electric scooters and bicycles. At that, it can be a good idea to focus on the Asian market through the acquisition of some local manufacturers (for example, Ya Bao Jinan) or the development of partnerships with such companies (Freyssenet 2016). This strategy will enable the company to diversify its product range, expand into new markets, explore new businesses and technological opportunities.

When applying the Ansoff Matrix, the strategy can be linked to such areas as market penetration and diversification (see Figure 3). The analysis of this option using the tool mentioned above shows that this strategy is associated with moderate risks. However, the strategy is worth implementing as the market is ready for this kind of product while the use of the safest area (acquiring local companies or entering partnerships) will reduce the risk.

Figure 3. Ansoff Matrix.

The evaluation of the strategy with the use of SAF criteria reveals its effectiveness and benefits for the company. In terms of the suitability criterion, the development of electric scooters and bicycles is an effective or even logical choice. The analysis of the external factors shows that customers, as well as governments, positively view these products. It is expected that electric vehicles will become mainstream within decades (Priestley 2015).

Therefore, the development of such widespread vehicles as scooters and bicycles can help the company engage more people in the use of electric vehicles (Latest research on electric motorcycles and scooters market size 2016). People often prefer this means of transport for urban settings and short distances. More so, it can be vital to enter the Asian market with this product as electric scooters and bicycles are specifically popular in Asian countries (including China).

Scooters and bicycles are a popular type of transport in Asia, but these vehicles are powered by environmentally-unfriendly resources (Freyssenet 2016). There is a shift towards greener options in China, which is an opportunity for manufacturers of green technologies. The charging infrastructure will be suitable for all the electric vehicles so the company may develop its network of charging points.

As for the acceptability component of the analysis, it is possible to expect significant acceptance of the strategy among the stakeholders involved. Thus, the company will develop a new line, which is associated with opportunities for employees (who may receive a promotion, realize their ideas, and so on).

As for external acceptance, customers are likely to be interested in buying new products. As has been mentioned above, people are choosing scooters and bicycles for short distances, and the focus on environmental issues will make electric vehicles the best option (Freyssenet 2016). Chinese consumers are also becoming more environmentally conscious, which will make electric scooters and bicycles widespread in the region. The strategy is likely to translate into considerable financial gains due to this acceptance on the part of customers.

Finally, as to the feasibility criterion of the evaluation, the strategy is also successful if implemented properly. Tesla has significant resources that can be used to produce a new type of vehicle. However, there are still certain limitations. The company does not have the necessary equipment as well as professionals. It is possible to invest in this area, but it will be associated with the allocation of considerable funds. Therefore, it is possible to develop a certain alliance with a manufacturer of scooters and bicycles in Asia. Tesla will be able to save funds and come up with a new product.

Another strategic option that can increase Tesla’s entrepreneurial opportunity is associated with an increase in investment in the Chinese market. The company can focus on the development of its supercharger network and dealer expansion in the region. The use of the Ansoff Matrix can help evaluate the strategy (see Figure 3). The option is efficient as it can be placed in one of the safest quadrants of the matrix. Thus, the development of superchargers and dealers network will make electric vehicles more accessible, which is important for growth.

When using the SAF criteria, it is possible to note that the strategy is potentially beneficial for the company. As far as the suitability criterion is concerned, Schmitt (2016) notes that the market of electric vehicles is growing, and such giants as Mercedes and Volkswagen start paying more attention to this region and this market. This can be a certain challenge as the competition will grow. However, it is also a good opportunity for the company to develop and increase its presence in the region.

Importantly, Tesla’s products are popular in China, and such new offers as Model X are expected to be a hit of sales (Soo 2016). At that, the development of the market of electric vehicles is also associated with the development of the infrastructure that can cover vast territories of Asia. Therefore, Tesla can gain a lot from the development of its supercharger network. People in more areas will have access to electric vehicles, which can lead to growing sales as well as various opportunities for further entrepreneurial activity.

When analyzing the acceptability criterion, it is necessary to note that the strategy may be associated with some challenges. As to the financial component, it is clear that the company will have to invest significant funds to implement the strategy. However, there is still a lack of governmental support provided to foreign manufacturers, and it could lead to larger revenues. The Chinese government subsidizes heavily local manufacturers providing them with various incentives creating a favorable business environment for them, which can be an obstacle for a foreign organization (Masiero et al. 2016).

As far as the domain of stakeholders’ acceptability is concerned, it is possible to note that the strategy’s outcomes can be quite controversial. On the one hand, there is a shift towards green technologies in China (Masiero et al. 2016). Nonetheless, Chinese car buyers still focus on such aspects as the price and quality. Therefore, it is important to be ready that this strategy will be beneficial in the long run, and no short-term benefits are likely to be gained. It can be necessary to develop a partnership with a local company specializing in electric vehicle manufacturing, which will help in gaining governmental support.

Finally, the feasibility criterion of the evaluation helps to identify an important aspect to be taken into account. The development of the supercharger network and dealer expansion in China will require considerable resources that are rather scarce in the period of certain financial constraints the global economy is experiencing. The company reports the rise in sales, but they are lower than expected, which shows certain vulnerability (Ramsey 2016). The company should wisely allocate funds. Therefore, it is important to start the development of the supercharging network in the areas where the interest to electric vehicles, as well as sales, is growing.

On balance, the two strategies mentioned can help Tesla to increase its entrepreneurial opportunities through growth and innovations. The strategies are associated with some challenges, but they can be addressed easily if the strategies are implemented properly. Therefore, the company should consider developing electric scooters, building partnerships with Chinese companies, and expanding to the Asian market.

The First Lie (Part 1),Backcountrydrifter_,1i6jb0u,2025-01-21 09:05:53,10,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Backcountrydrifter_/comments/1i6jb0u/the_first_lie_part_1/,Odd_Conversation_114,,"Vito Genovese, a member of Cosa Nostra, was deported to Italy before World War II, where he bribed Benito Mussolini on behalf of “The Commission” (the five Cosa Nostra crime families) to secure permission to process and export massive amounts of heroin to the United States. While heroin was legal in Italy at the time, distribution required the ability to transport and land it in the U.S.

Project Underworld was Lucky Luciano’s attempt to reduce his 30-year prison sentence. As the architect of Cosa Nostra, Luciano had designed the organization to quell the inter-rivalry violence that threatened to destroy every mob model eventually.

Albert Anastasia, a leader in both Cosa Nostra and Murder Inc., had risen to the top ranks of the International Longshoremen’s Association. Before his death, he admitted to starting the fire on the SS Normandie in New York Harbor. That incident forced the Department of the Navy, where John Connally served as an aide to the commander, to approach Luciano’s mob, which controlled the longshoremen, for “security” against German U-boats.

It was simply a scaled-up version of the old mob “protection” racket: a thug torches your store and then promises it won’t happen again as long as you pay him every week.

That old world gangster bullshit gave the mob full control of U.S. ports under the guise of patriotism, along with control of both ends of their heroin trafficking logistics. It also gave Luciano the bargaining chip he had been seeking for nearly a decade to get out of prison, where he was serving time for forcing women into prostitution. From his cell, Luciano continued to run Cosa Nostra business using a personal phone he had bribed prison guards to install.

Luciano’s prostitution racket gave him leverage over the kompromised politicians who frequented the women he controlled, making it a generational precursor to Jeffrey Epstein’s operation. Whatever bribes that prison guard and warden took to slip in food and install a phone were probably some of the most destructive in world history.

Meyer Lansky, the other third of Luciano’s childhood gang that formed the Cosa Nostra Commission, spent the same time period in Cuba building casinos to launder money by bribing the corrupt dictator Batista. Later, when Fidel Castro overthrew Batista, the mob tried to assassinate Castro. When that failed, they turned it into a CIA operation, further revealing how deeply infused the mob and the government had become at key milestones in the 20th century.

Murder Inc. was Meyer Lansky’s contribution to Cosa Nostra. It was a group of Jewish assassins with a body count of well over 1,000. They operated primarily in Chicago and New York. The belief was that employing Jewish gangsters would draw less attention from the police than using Italians.

Jack “Ruby” Rubenstein was originally from Chicago, where, as a young man, he worked with Al Capone and the other two-fifths of Cosa Nostra, also known as The Outfit.

While working for the CIA during Johnson’s administration, Felix Rodriguez ordered the execution of Castro’s second-in-command, Che Guevara, in Bolivia and staged the scene to make it look like Guevara was killed in a firefight. (Dovetails with Project Wormwood, Iran-Contra, and Rodriguez’s killing DEA agent Kiki Camarena in 1985.)

With Batista, the mafia had a full logistical circle and control of three critical governments.  Castro and Guevara threatened that directly.

The Bay of Pigs invasion was sabotaged by mob agents to politically destroy Kennedy as they lost control of him. Under Batista, Cuba was critical to the mob’s money laundering operations. A condition of Luciano’s release from prison was his deportation to Italy, but he quickly and quietly made his way to Cuba, which was central to their enterprise.

The Soviet Union became involved when Castro reached out to them for financial and military assistance, setting the stage for the Cuban Missile Crisis. Arguably, none of this would have happened if corruption had not taken hold of Cuba first.

John F. Kennedy was being played by the mob, which had infiltrated his own government at the request of his father.

The world was nearly brought to nuclear extinction so Cosa Nostra could continue profiting off the plague of heroin they unleashed on the USA.

Mexico City has always been a hotbed of KGB (now FSB) activity, which is where Lee Harvey Oswald had been just before Kennedy’s assassination. Before that, he spent time in Minsk, Belarus, down the street from a KGB training center, where he married a Russian woman and tried to defect to Russia. George de Mohrenschildt was likely Oswald’s stateside Russian handler or observer.

Robert Kennedy had set his sights on breaking up the mob, or at least any mob except for his father Joseph Kennedy’s. Joe Kennedy made his initial fortune during Prohibition, then rigged Wall Street for the 1929 naked short scheme that caused the Great Depression. He later moved to Hollywood, where he produced B movies to launder the stolen money and engaged in the projectionist union racket. It gave him the funds necessary to get a member of the family into the presidency.

Fundamentally, that is all anyone in the mob really wants, because it allows them to control the laws their criminal empires are built to break.

Joseph Kennedy then became the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It’s just more efficient business to own governments.

Joe Kennedy had approached Sam Giancana of the Chicago mob (The Outfit) for help in securing the votes necessary to win Illinois for his son John’s election. When Joe Kennedy didn’t or couldn’t force his son Robert Kennedy to end the investigations into the mob, Giancana felt double-crossed but, by the nature of criminality, couldn’t say anything about it.

[https://www.historyhit.com/sam-giancana-mob-boss/](https://www.historyhit.com/sam-giancana-mob-boss/)

At some point, as the original heroin smuggling conspiracy network started breaking down, John Kennedy had to go. Then Robert Kennedy, who, as head of the Department of Justice, was investigating it. Their father, Joseph Kennedy, was being taught a lesson by Sam Giancana: you NEVER double-cross the mob.

John Kennedy and Vito Genovese shared a mistress named Judith Exner (aka Judith Campbell).

John Connally and his lifelong friend Lyndon Johnson cross paths repeatedly with the Cosa Nostra mafia.

[https://medium.com/save-texas-history/governor-john-connally-and-traces-of-the-jfk-assassination-in-the-glo-archives-b8e5c43462ec](https://medium.com/save-texas-history/governor-john-connally-and-traces-of-the-jfk-assassination-in-the-glo-archives-b8e5c43462ec)

John Connally served as an aide to James Forrestal and Dwight Eisenhower during World War II under the Department of the Navy.

Forrestal was the last cabinet-level Secretary of the Navy and the first Secretary of Defense as JSOC was adopted as a philosophy. He was fiercely hostile to the Soviet Union and opposed the formation of the state of Israel, largely because he believed it would threaten critical oil supplies from Arab countries.

Forrestal subsequently died after falling from a sixteenth-floor window with a bathrobe sash cord tied around his neck. (Dovetail Project Wormwood) His death was recorded as a suicide due to severe depression.

Forrestal wasn’t depressed. He was being gaslit, manipulated and lied to on an industrial scale from both sides of his chain of command. Lies always break eventually, but they usually break honest brains first.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_Forrestal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Forrestal)

In 1964, no one could have conceived of Connally as JFK’s shooter, but when you paint the entire network of his corrupt connections to the early 20th-century mob in reverse and watch the Zapruder film, you can see the angle of the headshot that killed Kennedy coming from in front of Kennedy and below.

[https://youtu.be/\_0-yOa5sSg0](https://youtu.be/_0-yOa5sSg0)

John Connally turns to the right and uses his hat in his right hand as cover while firing a pistol hidden in his jacket under his right arm. The gas escaping the barrel causes his coat lapel to lift. He then shifts left and slumps inward toward the centerline of the car. This is quite obvious with modern advancements in image stabilization and stop motion. It was understandably harder to see in 1963, when the 8mm film used to capture the Zapruder footage was state of the art.  It also helped that the U.S. population still assumed their government had not been infiltrated by the mafia.

[https://history-matters.com/essays/jfkmed/BigLieSmallWound/BigLieSmallWound.htm](https://history-matters.com/essays/jfkmed/BigLieSmallWound/BigLieSmallWound.htm)

The obstructed barrel also causes partial fragmentation of the bullet, cracking Connally’s fifth rib (directly adjacent to the gun chamber) and puncturing his lung. The explosion creates trauma at the back of the pistol, just under his right nipple. The constrained blast likely caused a catastrophic failure of the weapon, shattering his right wrist, which would have been directly behind the gun chamber as he concealed it with his hat.

Connally’s friend and co-conspirator Lyndon Johnson hastily created the Warren Commission by executive order and staffed it with his own men. They attributed the assassination to the “magic bullet,” which they claimed passed through Kennedy, changed direction to enter Connally’s right lung, changed direction again to penetrate and shatter his wrist, then changed direction once more to end up in his leg, six inches above his left knee. The bullet was found whole, completely undamaged, and within two grains of weight of an unfired 6.5 Carcano bullet.

According to the Warren Commission, Bullet 399 (the ""magic bullet"") was a pristine 6.5 Carcano round conveniently found on the hospital stretcher Kennedy had been on. It would have been placed there by someone involved in the conspiracy. Nervous that their deceit had been discovered, they peppered the scene with additional evidence to redirect the investigation toward Lee Harvey Oswald and away from Connally. The Secret Service reportedly strong-armed the emergency room staff and thoracic surgeon into accepting their version of events. (Dovetail Trump assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-bullet\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-bullet_theory)

Two or three shots were fired from outside the car. At least one struck Kennedy in the back before Connally’s shot. At least one partial fragment of a bullet impacted the windshield from the inside.

[https://www.usglassmag.com/glass-evidence-was-a-second-shooter-involved-in-president-kennedys-assassination/](https://www.usglassmag.com/glass-evidence-was-a-second-shooter-involved-in-president-kennedys-assassination/)

The shot Connally fired from under his coat and hat was the kill shot that caused Kennedy’s head to kick upwards and backwards as his scalp lifted.

The self-inflicted damage to Connally was likely unintentional but then required cover-up.

The Connallys donated the suit he was wearing to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Assuming it is the legitimate suit, the bullet hole in the right posterior side would indicate an exit, not an entry. If the suit has not been laundered, powder burn residue should still be present inside the right armpit area, with concentrations around the bullet hole in the posterior, the area near the weapon’s action (directly adjacent to the fifth rib), and the right wrist. If the suit was cut off his body at the hospital, forensic testing could easily confirm its authenticity and reveal the presence of powder burns.

Connally was Lyndon Johnson’s aide early in his career, and the two were lifelong friends. One of Johnson’s conditions for accepting Kennedy’s vice-presidential nomination was that Connally be appointed Secretary of the Navy. Connally served in that role for just under a year before running for Governor of Texas. This was likely to allow Connally to scrub any evidence of his earlier heroin smuggling crimes from an executive position.

General Edwin Walker had been in the running against Connally for governor of Texas when he was also coincidentally shot at by a 6.5 Carcano on April 10, 1963.

The 6.5 Carcano, being a fairly obscure Italian cartridge in America, had its only D.O.D. purchase order placed by the U.S. Navy, connecting it back to Genovese and Connally using the Navy as a courier.

Walker was also the commanding general in Anzio, Italy, in early 1944, when he discovered his supplies were being stolen at the docks by Vito Genovese’s gang and likely replaced with heroin bound for the United States.

Robert Kennedy tried to have Walker committed on a 90-day psychiatric hold, likely as a stall tactic as the mob’s deal began to unravel. (Dovetail Project Wormwood)

Connally went on to create “Nixon Shock” with Henry Kissinger, which took the USD off the gold standard and handed control to the Saud ruling family through the petro-dollar and the creation of OPEC. (Dovetail KGB operative Carlos the Jackal’s siege of the OPEC convention in 1975, the Saud/Adnan Khashoggi arms deal, and Iran-Contra, which Saudi Arabia funded.)

Mussolini died violently in 1945. By 1950, the Golden Triangle above North Vietnam had become the world’s major source of heroin, a status it held until the 21st century, when production largely shifted to Afghanistan.

That timeline raises some interesting questions about almost everything involving both of those wars.

(Pages 12-14 are Connally’s ties to Texas billionaire oil, Sid Richardson, and the Lockheed bribery scandal)

Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. According to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed's international marketing, Khashoggi ""became, for all practical purposes, a marketing arm of Lockheed. Adnan would provide not only an entrée but strategy, constant advice, and analysis.""

This was all thanks to John Connally as well.

Connally was then indicted for fraud for price-fixing milk before becoming a key player in Reagan’s “October Surprise.” During a trip to the Middle East, he convinced Iranian leaders to keep the hostages until after Reagan’s election against Carter.

It makes the infamous “wink” photo between Lyndon Johnson and Albert Thomas (Connally’s friend and aide), taken 100 minutes after Kennedy’s assassination while Jackie Kennedy stood there with John F. Kennedy’s grey matter dripping off her blouse, make sense with the additional context.

In 1966 John Kennedys brain disappeared from storage in DC.  Likely because it proved forensically and ballistically that Connally shot him.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy\_of\_John\_F.\_Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_of_John_F._Kennedy)

Dorothy Kilgallen was murdered as she investigated these discrepancies.

In 1967, the USS Liberty was attacked by Israeli jets and then torpedo boats. It was intended to sink so the blame could be placed on Egypt, providing Lyndon Johnson with a pretext to enter Israel’s Six-Day War. When the ship didn’t sink, the evidence left behind turned the incident into a public relations nightmare, forcing Lyndon Johnson to personally make the matter disappear by executive order.

34 American servicemen were killed and 171 were wounded.

Yitzhak Rabin, who had planned the operation, suffered a mental breakdown as a result and had to sit out the war. He did not believe they would be able to maintain the lie.

### **Chapter XI: The Blade and the Ballot**

The Blade Staves the Depths

The control room aboard the Campos was a flurry of activity. Engineers monitored screens displaying live feeds from the Gulf of Mexico’s seafloor, while Sebastián Montalvo stood at the center of the room, his eyes locked on the main display. The Blade of Harmony, gleaming faintly in the dark waters, was being lowered toward the seafloor by a specialized submersible.

“Status update,” Sebastián demanded.

“Blade deployment in progress,” Dr. Elena Rivera replied, her voice steady despite the tension. “We’re approaching the target coordinates. Pressure levels are within acceptable ranges.”

The room fell silent as the Blade neared its destination—a fissure in the seafloor that fed the relentless oil leak from the Deepwater Horizon disaster. When the submersible’s robotic arms pressed the Blade into place, a low hum resonated through the monitors.

“It’s stabilizing,” Elena said, her tone shifting to relief. “Pressure levels are dropping. The flow is slowing.”

Sebastián exhaled, tension leaving his shoulders. “Good. Now let’s finish the job.”

Using gamma ray mapping, the team had identified a network of tunnels feeding the leak. Over the following weeks, engineers worked to cap and redirect the sources, guiding the oil to a controllable spout on a nearby rig.

Sebastián visited the site frequently, standing on the deck of a research vessel as progress reports rolled in. The Blade of Harmony remained embedded in the Gulf floor, a silent sentinel holding the disaster at bay.

“This is a temporary fix,” Elena reminded him during one visit. “The Blade can’t stay there forever. We need permanent solutions.”

Sebastián nodded, his gaze on the horizon. “We’ll get there. One step at a time.”

---

The Ballot Decides

Months later, Sebastián found himself in a different kind of battle—the gubernatorial election. Standing on a podium in the heart of New San Juan, he addressed a crowd of supporters.

“Puerto Rico is at a crossroads,” he said, his voice carrying over the plaza. “We can choose the path of innovation and ambition, or we can settle for short-term fixes that leave our children with the same problems we inherited. I know which path I’m fighting for.”

But Sebastián’s vision, though inspiring, clashed with the concerns of a weary populace. Rising costs of living, stalled housing projects, and a growing healthcare crisis weighed heavily on voters’ minds. His opponent, Carlos Barrera, promised pragmatism and fiscal discipline—prioritizing immediate needs over Sebastián’s grand projects.

During a televised debate, Barrera capitalized on the discontent. “Governor Montalvo’s vision is admirable,” he said, “but dreams don’t build homes. They don’t put food on the table or fix the potholes in our streets. It’s time for leadership that listens to the people.”

Election night arrived with a mix of anticipation and dread. Sebastián watched the results from his private study in Casa Montalvo, surrounded by his closest advisors. When the final count came in, the verdict was clear: Barrera had won.

Sebastián rose from his chair, his expression composed despite the loss. Turning to Isabella Vélez-Campo, he said, “The people have spoken. Let’s hope they chose wisely.”

---

Aftermath

As Barrera took office, Sebastián quietly stepped away from public life, though he remained a figure of influence. The Blade of Harmony continued to hold the Gulf’s scars in check, a testament to Sebastián’s tenure. But the new administration, focused on austerity, diverted funds from renewable energy and restoration projects, leaving many of Sebastián’s initiatives unfinished.

In his first public address as Governor, Barrera declared, “We are turning a page. Puerto Rico needs practical solutions, not lofty dreams. Together, we will build a future grounded in reality.”

Sebastián, watching from a quiet corner of New San Juan, felt a pang of regret. But as he gazed at the city’s skyline, he knew his work was far from over.

"RedNote, Flip, Clapper and Likee claim the top of the App Store as TikTok comes back online",NextGenTechTalkie,1i6cip6,2025-01-21 01:30:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextGenTechTalkie/comments/1i6cip6/rednote_flip_clapper_and_likee_claim_the_top_of/,Weekly-Rip-2899,,"[TikTok may be back](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/tiktok-is-restoring-service-in-the-us/), but that hasn’t prevented other Chinese competitors from gaining users. In the lead up to a ban on TikTok — which kicked off Sunday and lasted a day — a number of other video apps rose through the ranks and now dominate the App Store’s Top Charts.

The Chinese app RedNote (which is listed on the app stores as Xiaohongshu) became the No. 1 app in the U.S. last week, followed by video apps like Clapper, Flip, and others. On Monday, following [TikTok’s restoration of service](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/tiktok-is-restoring-service-in-the-us/), RedNote retained its No. 1 spot on the App Store, after having [attracted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/over-half-million-tiktok-refugees-flock-chinas-rednote-2025-01-14/) some 700,000 new U.S. users.

TikTok users’ [move to RedNote](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/xiaohongshu-rednote-chinas-answer-to-instagram-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store-as-tiktok-faces-us-shutdown/) was meant to send a signal to U.S. lawmakers and Meta alike that they would rather join another Chinese app similar to TikTok than return to Instagram Reels. 

Though TikTok is back online, the app stores[ aren’t yet hosting it for download](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347340/tiktok-ban-app-store-google-play); app marketplaces still have to abide by U.S. law, despite President-elect Trump’s assurances that he will extend the deadline for the TikTok ban.

Instead, both app stores’ top charts continue to reflect the shift to other TikTok alternatives.

In Apple’s U.S. App Store, for instance, video apps including RedNote, Likee, Clapper, and Flip hold the No. 1, 2, 4, and 10 spots in the Overall Top Charts as of Monday morning. Favorited, an app dedicated to livestreams, is No. 15.

Social network Bluesky also just added an optional custom video feed, however, its app has dropped out of the top 10 position it held last week on the U.S. App Store. It’s No. 13 as of Monday morning on the App Store and No. 15 on Google Play. "

Greg and Rose were in their room, Rose was sitting at her desk on her laptop. Greg was sitting on a chair. She opened her Facebook, something that she does not do often and she got a message from Cartoon Network regarding her YouTube video back in June of 2008.

""Greg, look! I got a message on Facebook, it's from Cartoon Network regarding that video we took of Steven,"" she said

It has now been four years and a lot has happened to the Universe family, Rose finally got a loan and opened a bakery in Los Angeles. Greg opened a music store in Hollywood, They had a beautiful house in Beverley Hills. Both of them had amazing careers, and a beautiful life in LA, what could go wrong?

Then, they heard something in the living room. Rose grabs her sword, Greg follows her, and goes downstairs.

The design promotes a sense of spaciousness and is ideal for entertaining.

Expect to see soaring ceilings, often adorned with elegant chandeliers or modern light fixtures, creating a dramatic effect in the living and dining area.

Interiors would typically showcase high-end materials such as marble or hardwood flooring, custom cabinetry, and upscale finishes. Natural stone countertops in kitchens and bathrooms would be common.

The furniture would likely reflect a modern aesthetic, with clean lines and a mix of neutral tones and bold accents. Plush sofas, a nice coffee table, and statement art pieces would contribute to the luxurious feel.

Large glass doors and windows connect indoor spaces to outdoor areas, such as patios or decks, enhancing the California lifestyle. Outdoor living spaces might include lounges or dining areas.

Bathrooms would often feature soaking tubs, walk-in showers, and double vanities with high-end fixtures, creating a serene retreat.

With the rise of technology, many homes would incorporate smart home systems for lighting, climate control, and security, enhancing convenience and efficiency.

Their son—who was now eleven years old, was in the kitchen while Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo, were on the couch, the boys were now three years older than Steven.

The boys were playing on Steven's PlayStation, Steven was in the kitchen making Pop-Tarts for them. Steven screams as he sees his mother wielding her sword.

""Oh, it's just you!"" Rose said.

""Yeah, it's me! who do you think it was? the boogeyman?""

Rose put her sword in her scabbard and held it.

""Dude, What's wrong? You okay?"" Greg asked

""Yes, it was Sumo who screamed, Dad!"" he said, rolling his eyes.

""Sorry!"" Sumo said, holding the controller in his hands.

""That's okay, We thought that someone was hurt,"" he said, sighing in relief.

""Hey guys, why won't you guys get out of the house?"" Greg asked.

""Hey guys, let's go to our treehouse!"" Steven said.

""Yeah!"" Clarence said, as they all went and grabbed their bikes to ride there.

Steven was about to ride there when their neighbor walked out, Their neighbor was none other than Pearl.

""Steven!"" Pearl said, Steven looked at the tall gem.

""Yeah, pearl?""

""Where are you going?""

*Oh my stars, come on! can you get off my back?*

Steven tried not to roll his eyes at her then put on a smile. ""I'm going with Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo to our treehouse.""

""Okay, Steven. Make sure you ride safely,"" she told him. Steven tried not to roll his eyes again and he looked at her. ""I will be fine, Pearl! let's go guys,"" he said, riding with them to the treehouse.

…

Clarence, Jeff, Steven, and Sumo parked their bikes When they were about to go up. Steven's phone went off. He saw the caller ID was Ameythest.

""Hey, Ameythest!""

*""Hey, dude. Do you wanna come to my basketball game that's tonight? my mom can pick you up.""*

Steven's enthusiasm went way up. ""Sure! when is it?"" he said

*""It's at five thirty.""*

""Heck yes! I'll see you there!"" he said

*""Awesome, dude. I'll see you!""* Steven said goodbye to her then they all played.

Clarence, Sumo, Jeff, and Steven all went to grab ramen. They rode their bikes to the nearest one in LA and parked, Steven and his friends went inside the restaurant and got a table.

Steven and his friends all sat at a table, Steven got some lemonade and sushi. Same with his friends.

""Hey Steven, I have a question,"" Jeff said drinking his lemonade.

""What's up?""

""Why don't you age like us? your twelve right?"" Sumo asked the boy, Steven put a hand in his hair and nodded. ""Yeah?""

""Then, why aren't you growing like us?"" Clarence asked. Steven has not told them this before, not even in the four years that he's known them. ""Are you sure that you're twelve, Steven?""

""Yes, I'm twelve, but I'm part gem, so I age slower than other kids."" He said. his friends nod, and the waitress walks over and gives them their sushi.

""Thank you,"" Steven said, eating his sushi.

""Hey, Steven? You wanna come with us to the community pool tomorrow, my mom texted me if you want to come."" Clarence told him.

""Yeah!"" Steven said, raising his arms p.

""Let's do it, is your mom going to pick me up?"" Steven asked.

""Yeah, If you want to,"" he said. Steven nodded. ""Okay, this is gonna be so much fun!"" Sumo exclaimed.

""Yeah, It is!""

…

Steven was getting ready to go to Ameythest's game at her school. Steven walked down the stairs of the house, and Greg and Rose said yes that he could go. Steven went outside, zipped up his jacket and he went into her father's truck.

""Hey! Steven!"" Amethyst said. Giving him a fist bump.

""What's up?"" he asked, closing the door

""Fine,"" he said, Adrain drove off to her high school, Ameythest grabbed her CD and put it into the player that was in the car, and played some rock. Steven was jamming out to the song as they were driving.

Adrain parks at the parking lot and they go to the gym, they go to the building. Four other girls were out practicing. Her coach walks up.

Steven saw her basketball coach.

She is a passionate African American woman in her late 30s. She has a strong presence, standing tall with an athletic build, reflecting her years of playing and coaching the game. Her hair is styled in natural curls, often pulled back into a ponytail during practices and games.

Her coaching style is energetic and motivational, emphasizing teamwork, discipline, and hard work. She wears comfortable athletic gear, usually a branded team hoodie and basketball shorts, paired with sneakers that allow her to move quickly on the court.

Off the court, she is known for her engaging personality and dedication to mentoring her players, instilling confidence and resilience in them. She often organizes community events to foster support for the team and promotes inclusivity and empowerment among young female athletes in the area. Her leadership is not just about winning games but also about building character and community.

""Well, guess who decided to join us."" Her coach said.

""Sorry, Coach. Talia.""

""Get into your uniform, alright, We starting soon."" She nodded and walked to the locker room.

""Let's sit Steven,"" Adrain said, walking him to the bleachers and they found a space to sit and watch.

""Why is basketball season so late? I thought It was in November. Where in March.""

""Her last game is tonight, Steven.""

""Oh, okay,"" he said as he watched the game.

""THE AGOURA HILLS BLAZE WIN!"" The commentator said, jumping from his seat. Steven smiled and clapped for her team.

…

Steven was now back home, he hopped out of the shower, went out, and looked around his bedroom.

The walls are painted in a vibrant red or adorned with posters of his favorite bands, and the NBA team—The Los Angeles LAKERS with his favorite player Kobe Bryant, some Justice League, and Captain America posters were also on the walls.

He also had a full-sized bed for sleepovers with Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo, often covered with a fun, themed bedspread. A desk was present, cluttered with school supplies and books.

The floor was strewn with toys, action figures, or sports gear, reflecting his hobbies. A bookshelf might showcase a mix of novels, comic books, and trophies from sports or other achievements.

Lighting could come from a bedside lamp shaped like a character—In this case, was Batman.

Steven pulled back the covers and slipped into them, it took him a while for him to fall asleep but, he did."

Xi Jinping turned to Mao Zedong-era system to lift millions of China’s rural poor out of poverty,SomaliSocialism,1i67bzo,2025-01-20 20:42:15,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaliSocialism/comments/1i67bzo/xi_jinping_turned_to_mao_zedongera_system_to_lift/,AgeofInformationWar,News,"Can't link the article and it's an old one, but still pretty relevant. Worker coops being shown to have its part under socialism and Somalia in the past had that (still in a very few areas), but this worker coop model should be utilized if we get Socialist Somalia again (from the article):

* President Xi Jinping has pledged to lift millions of rural poor out of poverty and he is hoping a revitalised Mao-era system will do the trick
* More than 10,000 primary supply and marketing cooperatives have been set up in the past six years and funding for them is growing fast

Beijing is rebooting an old state-run cooperative system to help boost the rural economy, but after years of reform some analysts are sceptical about how effective it can be in helping the country’s millions of impoverished farmers.Since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2013, the central government has rebuilt more than 10,000 primary supply and marketing cooperatives (SMC), taking the total across the country to nearly 32,000. About 95 per cent of towns and villages now have them, compared to just 50 per cent six years ago.Unlike in other countries, where cooperatives are characterised by their democratic management and profit-sharing systems, in rural China – after years of dormancy and unsuccessful reform – they operate more like state-owned businesses.While in the 1950s they served an important political role in controlling the supply and price of agri-food and consumer goods, their primary objective today is helping farmers find customers and strengthen their position in the marketplace.According to official figures, at the end of last year China’s 32,000 cooperatives had more than 340,000 subdivisions offering all manner of services from buying fruit and vegetables, to selling seeds and fertiliser.

Expanding that network is a key feature of Xi’s plan to revitalise the countryside – where the Communist Party of China has its roots – and deliver on his pledge to lift millions of people out of poverty, and narrow the income gap between rural and urban dwellers.While disposable income per capita has been growing faster in rural areas than in towns and cities, the gap between the two in absolute terms rose to 24,634 yuan (US$3,650) last year, an increase of 45 per cent from 17,038 yuan at the end of 2013, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

While disposable income per capita has been growing faster in rural areas than in towns and cities, the gap between the two in absolute terms rose to 24,634 yuan (US$3,650) last year, an increase of 45 per cent from 17,038 yuan at the end of 2013, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

As China’s economic growth has slowed, so Beijing has been pushing primary SMCs to help boost rural consumption by building more e-commerce platforms and logistics centres.Since 2016, the central government has significantly increased its funding for the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives – also known as China Co-op – the cabinet-level agency that oversees SMCs, and last month named Liu Shiyu, the former head of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), as its executive director.

In 2016, funding tripled from a year earlier to more than 2.3 billion yuan (US$341 million) and continued upwards to 2.87 billion yuan in 2017 and 2.89 billion last year, although official figures for 2018 have yet to be released. By comparison, in 2017 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a cabinet-level think tank, received 2.34 billion yuan and the CSRC about 1.18 billion yuan.

Yang Huan, an associate professor specialising in rural policy at Huazhong Agricultural University in central China, said the spike in funding for the co-ops suggested Beijing was aware it had not achieved its goal of helping small farmers secure access to big markets and wanted to do more.“SMCs have been battling to find their role in the economy for years,” she said.“From the government’s point of view, their job now is to serve rural farmers. So it needs to expand the service network. That’s the plan.”

But the cooperatives would not have it all their own way, Yang said.“The SMCs face competition from private marketing platforms, and suppliers of inputs for agricultural production at the local level,” she said.“The reality is that they have to strike a balance between making a profit and providing a public service, and there could be conflict between the two.”Forrest Zhang, an associate professor of sociology at Singapore Management University, said that another possible reason for Beijing reviving the SMCs was that traditional farmers’ cooperatives set up to pool resources for the benefit of all had not worked out very well.

As state-run SMCs lost their influence during the market reforms of the 1980s, a new kind of cooperative fever emerged in the early 2000s as grass-roots organisations sprang up across the country. Beijing promoted the movement with huge financial subsidies, and as of June last year, their number had grown to more than 2.1 million.Despite that massive growth, the system was fundamentally flawed and soon became a breeding ground for corruption.Between 2009 and 2016, Zhang and his colleagues interviewed members of farmers’ cooperatives in 18 provinces across China. Their findings, published a year later, were shocking.

Of the 50 groups they visited, just two were genuine. The rest were either private businesses controlled by individual owners rather than member farmers, or fronts for fraudulent operations set up with the sole purpose of cheating the state out of its money.“SMCs are state-run marketing organisations that originated in the Mao \[Zedong\] era, while the farmers’ co-ops are a more recent development,” Zhang said.“My guess is that the government has realised \[after seeing the study’s findings\] that the spontaneous farmers’ co-ops have not played the role it wanted them to in uniting producers and strengthening their positions in the market, so it is looking to revitalise the SMC system as an alternative … and that makes a lot of sense.”

She was 14, only one month shy of her birthday, and even though I had a few months of extra time with her after discovering she had malignant cancer in her belly, mentally preparing for the inevitable did nothing for the depth of heartache I am feeling.

To add to it, this last year was really challenging in that my mother got really sick and almost died, but even though she is doing better now, it revealed her cognitive decline which has been heartbreaking to witness. While she remains undiagnosed for the time being, I experience ongoing anticipatory grief for losing her as well as watching her fade slowly -- but this feeling of loss over my sweet cat is tearing my heart out of my chest. The grief is immense.

She was with me for 14 1/2 years -- through some of the hardest years of my life, and through some of the most beautifully healing years. We had a really deep, special bond, and making the decision to say goodbye was one of the hardest I've ever had to make. I am exhausted (and probably dehydrated) from crying, my heart is so broken, and there are moments my mind wants to ruminate on what I could've done to help her live longer, on if I made the right decision, on her no longer being here with me.

I do have my other kitty who is being so sweet and affectionate, but it doesn't take away the void I feel. I am taking time to pick out an urn, and a personalized keepsake box to keep some of her fur in, and I am looking into cremation jewelry, like a ring made with some of her ashes. I bought some pink and white roses to honor her and have been lighting a candle in the evenings as a makeshift memorial for now. But my goodness - I am so, so sad.

Can you please share with me ways that have helped you hold yourself through grief and loss? When does it get easier? I have a very small network and no one to hold me and I feel like I need someone to stroke my hair while I sob in their arms.

\*\*\*

EDIT: Oh my goodness -- I am overwhelmed by all of your beautiful comments, and stories of your sweet babies that have passed. I read them all through tears of recognition, and feeling understood. What a gift our little fur babies are, and what a gift it is to love so much that it hurts so deep. I have been allowing myself to cry and sob and at this very moment I have a candle lit for my girl as I know she is still here. Her little spirit lives on in my heart and in my memories, and I am so grateful she chose me. This morning was the first morning I was really able to feel a little bit of peace that she is no longer in pain, as her final months she was being so strong for me. I miss her immensely, but I realized I was the one who had to be strong for her in the end, and with that comes this depth of grief. Thank you again -- for your warmth, your kindness, and all of your suggestions. I feel so grateful for you all taking the time to comment here."

Bitcoin Today 01/20/2025: BTC hits a new all-time high driven by Trump's inauguration,CapitalistExploits,1i5r0ic,2025-01-20 09:12:43,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i5r0ic/bitcoin_today_01202025_btc_hits_a_new_alltime/,kayakero,,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again surpassed all-time highs during the last weekend prior to Donald Trump's inauguration, which takes place this Monday, January 20. Driven by expectations of a government favorable to the crypto ecosystem, the price of the cryptocurrency rose by almost 4% in the last 24 hours, trading at $108,402.

According to CoinGecko, BTC reached a new all-time high of $109,000. Ethereum (ETH) increased by 5.3%, opening the day at $3,350.

In the Top 100, a new wave of memecoins dominated both sides of the market. On the bright side, the new First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, inspired the creation of a memecoin called $MELANIA, which gained prominence by rising 53% and leading the gains in the Top 100.

In contrast, the memecoin $TRUMP, which had racked up an impressive gain of over 12,000%, corrected with a 14% drop, leading the few losses of the day among major cryptocurrencies.

With this appreciation, expectations are growing that BTC could meet recent projections and reach $130,000 in February. In addition to Trump's inauguration, the possibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve also contributed to the sharp rise in price.

**Optimism about a Bitcoin strategic reserve**

Investors are renewing their optimism regarding the possible creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the United States. According to data from prediction platform Polymarket, prior to the recent rally, only 37% of users believed that the Trump administration would initiate BTC purchases within the first 100 days of his term.

However, as the value of BTC began to rise, the odds also increased. Within minutes, the favorable bets rose to 59%, but then fell back to 53%. This level of optimism is the highest since November 6, when Trump's victory was confirmed.

What are the three pillars of China OSINT,Key_Intelligence_,1i5j0js,2025-01-20 00:22:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Key_Intelligence_/comments/1i5j0js/what_are_the_three_pillars_of_china_osint/,JidongLiu,,"The triad for OSINT in China encompasses collection, analysis, and dissemination. More than 2.5 exabytes of data is collected every day from social media, satellite images, etc.; NLP algorithms do sentiment analysis for 2 million texts daily, and encrypted API interfaces achieve real-time intelligence pushes in less than 10 minutes.

# Collection

Information gathering is facing enormous quantities of data and multi-dimensional information channels. In 2024, the whole world will create about 2.5 exabytes per day, and Chinese Internet users contribute 28% to the whole world’s traffic. The number of articles updated every day on Weibo and WeChat public accounts alone is more than 50 million, while the blowing content of social platforms is distributed in an extremely wide manner. Precisely screen these open sources and ensure data quality.

A 2023 social data study showed that the peak of public opinion on hot events usually reached its peak within 48 hours. After certain emergencies, such as the release of public health announcements or new policy implementation details in a certain place, the keyword search volume on social platforms can surge 500% within 1 hour. Because of this, the use of data crawling scripts and an automated system with simple keywords is indispensable in being efficient. Python and R are usually applied to perform these tasks, especially for crawling in the API interface of social platforms, which have responses with millisecond-level speed.

From the high-resolution satellite images released by Global Observation Alliance, the latest 0.5 meters/pixel detail accuracy has shown certain vehicle trajectories and outlines of new buildings after analyzing the dynamic changes in airports, ports, and military facilities. According to incomplete statistics, every year, local governments in China publish more than 20,000 kinds of yearbooks and development reports covering economic indicators, social development statistics, construction plans, and other information. While these kinds of documents cannot be acquired simply by web crawling, they often provide more realistic and precise historical data for policy interpretation and economic trend forecasting.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple versions of data on case growth on social platforms, with one time the difference between the number of confirmed cases announced by the official and private statistics reaching as high as 15%-20%. It needs multiple cross-validation before analysis, especially for information of unknown or ambiguous data sources; best avoid those as much as possible. After two or more multi-source comparisons, an error rate reduction of 32% can be achieved.

# Analysis

The analysis phase in OSINT involves structured processing and multi-dimensional comparison of data. According to industry statistics in 2023, about 67% of the errors in intelligence come from the analysis phase, not from inaccurate data itself.

The general method for the data analysis industry is to use regression models, clustering algorithms, text analysis systems, and so on, to turn unstructured data into quantifiable indicators. In order to assess the effectiveness of policy implementation in a certain region, through trend analysis of employment rate data for 12 consecutive months, it was found that in the third month after the release of a policy, the employment rate rose by an average of 2.8%, but began to fall back in the sixth month, showing that the obvious initial effects of the policy lacked long-term support.

Social media: more than 4.5 billion tweets and comments are generated every day. To do this efficiently, intelligence analysts typically use NLP algorithms to conduct sentiment analysis and content classification on large sample data. According to an online public opinion analysis on a hot topic, out of 2 million comments about the topic, 78% of the content is focused on speculation related to the aftermath of the incident; only 10% involve hard facts.

Data such as the number of new cases per day and virus transmission rate can be modeled in epidemic prevention and control to predict the growth trend in the coming week. In the year 2020, based on medical data of a certain region, the ARIMA forecasting model was established to predict that in the next 7 days, the peak cases would reach 1,200, while in fact, there was only a difference of 3.5% between the actual data and the forecast.

It is on the core linkage of distinguishing data trends from traps by doing the correlation and casual analysis. For example, it was noted while analyzing the corporate financial data that during a quarter the revenue was increased by 15%, whereas the marketing expenses for that period have increased by 30% with an increase of merely 5% in market share. Such asymmetric growth triggered reflections among the analysts with questions regarding efficiency about the market launch strategy. It was finally found that though more than 90% of the target customer groups were covered by the invested advertising channels, the conversion rate was below the industry average.

# Dissemination

In OSINT, information dissemination will determine whether obtained intelligence can be timely and effectively grasped and utilized by the related departments, institutions, or individuals. Based on the 2023 Global Intelligence Industry Report, enhancing efficiency in intelligence dissemination will shorten decision-making by 25% to 30%.

Real-time intelligence updates for those industries with very high demand-for instance, emergency management and financial markets-should be done hourly or even within 10-minute intervals for the proper capturing of the risk signals and for the proper measure to be taken. In the case of a large-scale cyber attack, sending real-time intelligence to the customer’s network monitoring platform in JSON format allowed it to achieve risk reminders on the whole network within 2 minutes, greatly enhancing response efficiency in contrast to a 10-minute delay due to the traditional release of a manual report.

Through synchronous dissemination across multiple platforms, such as email, instant messaging software, API interface integration, etc., it can be ensured that different departments obtain consistent information within a time window. In the case of a logistics company facing delays in global supply chains, Slack, Teams, and email systems were integrated for information synchronization. This helped reduce communication delays by 48% and shortened the average decision time from 72 hours to 24 hours.

Graphical reports are easier to understand than simple plain text reports, and it gives a speed increase in processing by about 40%. Now, if a think tank publishes an annual macroeconomic forecast, the interactive dashboard can show the change in trends for various indicators, thus enabling the user to adjust different parameters to get real updates of forecast model results in real-time.

Where transmitting sensitive information, one should apply a strict encryption protocol and an access control procedure. More than 70% of intelligence leaks occur because of the improper management of internal authority or unencrypted data transmission. The risks can be considerably reduced and the security of communication improved by applying end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and auditing of data."

For once, I appreciated the quiet. It gave me time to reflect on the chaos of the last few days. The Tome of Toxins and the Albaryth now rested in my room. The Albaryth slept soundly, its small, stone cage perched against the wall, its wings and tail tucked in, its pure white fur glowing faintly in the dim light.

Kira and I sat cross-legged on the floor, the quiet between us strangely comforting. For the first time in what felt like forever, we were catching up. I recounted my experience with magic—the frustrations of trying to force it, the fleeting triumphs when the poison obeyed, and the strange, almost euphoric sensation of channeling it through my blade. Kira listened intently, her usual sharpness giving way to something softer, though the crease in her brow betrayed her worry.

“It’s all about the feels,” Kira said with a dismissive wave of her hand. “You think of ‘boom’ and ‘bam,’ and there it is. Magic just happens when you let it.”

I gave her a flat look. “You mean it just happens for you. That’s not how it works for everyone. The same way teaching you fighting techniques was pointless, teaching me magic with that method would be just as fruitless.”

She rolled her eyes but grinned. “Fair point. So, how does it work for you, then?”

I sighed. “For me, it’s a process. I have to ingest poison and then channel it into my blade. Once I’ve done that, I can use it. It’s not instantaneous, and it’s definitely not about ‘feels.’”

Kira’s expression shifted to one of concern, her brow furrowing. “That sounds dangerous. And painful.” Her voice softened. “Silas, I’m serious. You’re literally risking your life every time you ingest poison. Do you even realize how insane that is? What if it goes wrong, Silas? What if you misjudge the dose or don’t recognize the poison you’re dealing with?” What if it doesn’t work the way you expect?”

Her worry caught me off guard. It had been so long since someone genuinely cared about my well-being that I didn’t know how to respond. I avoided her gaze. “I’ve been fine so far,” I said weakly.

“Yeah, because you’ve been lucky,” she said sharply, her tone rising with frustration. “You think that luck is going to hold out forever? You’re an idiot, you know that?”

There was no malice in her voice, just worry. It made me feel smaller than I liked. “I get it,” I muttered, looking away. “But it’s the only way I can learn.”

“Maybe,” she said, crossing her arms. “But that doesn’t make it any less reckless.” Her sigh was heavy, but she dropped the argument. “Just… don’t get yourself killed, okay?”

I chose to ignore the jab and instead redirected the conversation. “I barely had time to experiment with magic before the Albaryth appeared.”

Kira’s eyes darted to the sleeping creature. “What even is that thing?” she asked.

“I… don’t actually know,” I admitted. “But I think I know where to check.”

I grabbed the **Tome of Toxins** and flipped through its pages. Its faintly metallic scent mixed with the room's air as the old parchment crinkled under my fingers. Sure enough, there was a section on the Albaryth, but this wasn’t just a passage; it was an intricate tale of mystery and power woven with reverence for the creature's rarity and danger:

*The Albaryth, a beast of shadow and light, heralds both fortune and calamity. Its appearance is said to foretell great change, though the outcome depends on the hue of its fur. White signals misfortune; black, prosperity. Known also as the White Myth, these creatures are among the rarest of all magical beasts. Their origin is deeply tied to the world’s earliest conflicts. During the War, when beasts of the natural world clashed with demons in a battle for dominion, blood spilled across charred earth and desolate fields. It is said that as the blood mingled and seeped into the ground, the Albaryth were born. Their delicate forms rose from the tainted soil, neither fully beast nor wholly otherworldly, but imbued with the essence of both.*

*The Albaryth’s form, though deceptively small and delicate, is a masterpiece of toxic evolution. Each Albaryth houses within itself countless poisons and toxins, capable of altering its appearance and augmenting its strength. Their fine fur forms a hidden network of needles that can pierce skin to deliver precise, deadly doses of venom. These toxins can shift and adapt, becoming nearly impossible to counteract. Some myths claim the Albaryth can combine their poisons into new forms entirely, creating effects never seen before.*

*Their most striking ability is their shapeshifting. An Albaryth can alter its form, sometimes growing larger or more fearsome to intimidate its foes. Other accounts tell of Albaryths assuming the guise of mundane animals or even humanoid figures, using their intelligence and cunning to outwit those who would harm them. Despite these gifts, they are elusive tricksters, avoiding confrontation unless provoked.*

*However, legends also speak of the Albaryths' capacity for loyalty. When one deems a person worthy, it will protect them with unwavering devotion, risking its life to ensure their safety. Yet, earning an Albaryth’s trust is no simple feat. Actions, not words, are required, for their discernment is as sharp as their needles. Even so, taming an Albaryth’s poison is unwise. The sheer potency of its toxins, combined with their variety, makes crafting an antidote nearly impossible. To mishandle such a substance is to invite death, for the time needed to counteract one poison often exceeds the time one has left to live.*

I closed the book slowly, the weight of the words pressing down on me. Kira didn’t hesitate. She smacked me on the back of the head. “What is wrong with you?” she snapped. “How could you be so reckless?”

“I didn’t know what it was,” I muttered, rubbing the back of my head.

“Then why would you just go around touching things you don’t know?” she demanded.

“It looked cute and harmless,” I said defensively. We both glanced at the Albaryth, its pure white fur gleaming softly as it curled up peacefully. Kira huffed, crossing her arms.

“Okay, fine,” she conceded. “It *does* look cute. But still, you need to stop doing dumb stuff like that.”

I summoned my dagger to distract from the lecture. This time, a mix of deep purple, black, and white light flashed as the blade materialized. The colors swirled briefly before settling into the familiar dark steel. I could feel something new, a memory of the poisons I had encountered. It was like recalling the flavors of food: distinct, vivid, and unique. I remembered the Widow’s Kiss, its dark fluid and bitter aroma. It struck me how similar it was to tasting something for the first time.

You could read about a dish, hear others describe its flavors, even smell it cooking, but none of that compared to the actual experience of tasting it. The sweetness of honey, the sharp tang of citrus, the bitterness of herbs—each one only fully understood once it touched your tongue. Poison, I realized, was much the same. The words in the Tome could describe its effects, its smell, its danger, but only exposure allowed me to truly grasp it. Each poison was different, as unique as the dishes served in the mess hall. And just like those meals, once I experienced it, it lingered in my memory, a vivid, tangible thing I could call upon. Exposure was the only way to truly understand and use it.

I tried to channel the Albaryth’s poison, expecting the same clarity. But nothing came. The dark poison of the Widow’s Kiss receded, and I felt… emptiness.

“That’s strange,” I muttered.

“What’s wrong?” Kira asked, leaning closer.

“I can’t channel the Albaryth’s poison,” I said. “Even though I experienced it, it feels incomplete. Maybe it’s because I passed out, or Griff burned some of it out of me. I don’t know.”

“You’re doing it wrong,” a voice interrupted.

I froze, turning to Kira. “What did you say?”

She blinked, confused. “I didn’t say anything.”

The room fell silent, save for the faint sound of breathing. Slowly, I turned toward the Albaryth. Its eyes were open now, glimmering with intelligence. It stared directly at me.

“You’re doing it wrong,” it repeated, its voice high-pitched and eerily similar to Kira’s.

My breath caught in my throat. The Albaryth tilted its head, its gleaming eyes narrowing with what could only be described as amusement. My heart raced as a thousand thoughts clashed in my mind. Was this fear? Awe? Curiosity? The creature seemed otherworldly, its intelligence palpable and unnerving. For a moment, I felt as though it were measuring me, weighing my worth.

“My poison is special,” it said, its tone matter-of-fact but laced with a playful edge. “You can’t just use it like the others. It doesn’t work that way."""

Kindle Oasis — I’m fed up.,kindle,1i50wfj,2025-01-19 10:26:41,0,0.33,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1i50wfj/kindle_oasis_im_fed_up/,CrystalMeath,My Kindle 📱,"I’ve been trying to convince myself that the Oasis is a half-decent e-reader since I spent $250 on it in 2022. But I’ve hit my breaking point trying to connect to my WiFi network after changing the password, only to discover I can’t update a single password; I have to **delete all the saved WiFi networks** to reconnect. 

It’s just a terrible device. It’s hard to believe a ‘premium’ eReader could be released in 2019 with:  
-	microUSB  
-	no 5GHz WiFi  
-	*terrible* battery life  (a week at best on WiFi)  
-	*terrible* software that lacks common sense — you seriously have to delete all WiFi networks just to update one password!?  
-	Amazon-purchased books that automatically delete themselves if you don’t connect to WiFi  
-	no support for DoT or DoH DNS on routers  

It was terrible in 2019 when it was released. It was terrible in 2022 when I bought mine. It’s terrible in 2025. It’s just ridiculous. I like the larger wider screen over the other kindles, but I’m at my wit’s end. I had to delete all my WiFi networks just because I changed the password on my home network, only to find out the Kindle won’t connect because my router is set to use encrypted DNS (DoT or DoH). My $15 smart light bulbs work just fine, as does literally every other device on my network besides this Kindle. 

I hate spending more money to read the same ebooks I already own, but I can’t take it anymore. My frequent anger at this Kindle is ruining my reading experience. I’m switching to a non-Amazon eReader by a company that actually is responsive to its customers’ needs and wants. Amazon just doesn’t care. “Kindle” is synonymous with “eReader,” and people will buy them no matter how outdated the hardware and neglected the software."

I bought a memecoin which rose a lot since trumps coin launched. 
The coin I have is Maga coin.

I use Coinbase Wallet and base network.
When i try to swap it, it Will only Trade me like 10% of its value for USDC. 
So lets say my market value of my coins is 1000$ i only get offered 100$ if I swap it to USDC. I also tried the other networks on the app, most gives about the same return offer in swapping.

Any suggestions what I could do, if there is a solution to get a bigger return? As of now im loosing money by making the Trade, from my initial investment."
[SF] In defiance to the Lion,shortstories,1i4v6g8,2025-01-19 04:54:54,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i4v6g8/sf_in_defiance_to_the_lion/,Folium_Creations,Science Fiction,"Dear Elzie.

I’m terribly sorry, that I have not written to you in quite some time. I hope you’re still employed in the factory, and that your occupation has not yet become eligible for drafting. Because the life in the trenches is not a life I wish upon anyone. We have about three or four days out of them and eight or nine in them. When we are out supposed to be resting, we have to go on working parties, digging graves or trenches, build fortifications, and any work needed. And no matter were we are, we are always under shell fire, so not much of rest anyway. Every day we can see more of their ships descending from the sky. If the other fronts are anything like ours, I fear that if the flowers of peace will ever be planted, it will be in soil spoiled by sulphur and blood. Lately the fighting has been incessant , the dead lay beyond our trenches, their extremities convulsively raised and contorted towards the sky like a dead forest. We wear our respirators almost constantly because of the awful smell of the dead. I’ll never get these sights out of my eyes, it will be an everlasting nightmare. If I live to come home, I’ll try to tell you all about it, because I cannot possibly express it in writing as words fail me. The things are indescribable.

Your loving Brother

Vurian





Carsius Prime, (Centarus Arm Sge Vul Quadrant).



Field Marshal Johannes Thorsson stood at the edge of the battle map, its flickering display painting him in shades of zircon and crimson. The lines of the front carved out of the landscape like scars. Sinuous and irregular their bulwarks extending seemingly without end in all directions but one, marking the frontline across the blasted terrain. The Cereus 62^(nd) army group had bled to hold their current ground, but the time for stalemate had passed. Now, the order had come the 62^(nd) had to pierce through to Lankensorn, force a spear through the ramparts and give the northern and eastern circumvallating forces a window to reconstitute and hopefully create their own breaches into the invaders lines. And tighten the noose further around the enemy forces bridgehead near Vergemler Steep. Captain Astrid Falkenholm of J Company, 105^(th) Ranger Battalion, approached with a brisk salute. She bore the drawn look of an officer who had spent weeks in the rain and mud, her once pristine uniform torn and stained with the grime of the trenches. Yet her eyes, still sharp as a predator’s, met the Field Marshal’s, with resolve.



\- “My lord Thorsson,” she began, her voice steady but taut with restrained frustration.



\- “Our scouts report the enemies have taken up additional positions on the Turmund Ridge and dug them self in deep. fortifications, earthworks, and heavy mortar positions. Our preliminary bombardments barely scratched them.”



Thorsson nodded, his expression as immovable as a stubborn ox.



\- “Ja. They are resourceful, got to give them that Falkenholm. And damn hard to dislodge once they manage to get them self's a footing. But we have to take the ridge!”



Astrid hesitated, her hands clenching behind her back.



\- “Permission to speak freely, sir?”



\- “You may.”



\-”The dead and wounded from yesterdays assault are still trickling down through our trenches towards the surgical FOB’s, I estimate about 35 000 casualities, I had to send parts of my company to assist with prioritisations and first aid ”



\- “We cannot repeat the failure at Harald’s Gate. If we march up that ridge head-on, the men will die in droves. Their forces have stood stalwart against all our attacks and they quickly adapt. Their incursions more precise and their counter attacks more ferocious. If we commit to yet a another massive direct assault, I fear we will lose more than men, we will lose hope in our ranks”



Thorsson raised a hand, silencing her without ire.



\-”I know, that you know, just as well as I do ,that our ongoing efforts and relentless attacks are not solely to try and gain ground and push their lines further back. We can give them no respite, no room to concentrate their forces. ”



Astrid felt a sharp cold wave of embarrassment and shame wash over her, she tensed her jaw as she fought back a blush creeping up her neck.  
  


The Field marshal walked over to one of the reinforced viewing ports of the command bunker and stared up at the low thick cloud cover that concealed the sky.



\- “I hope you don’t think, I do not see, Falkenhom? That you believe I would throw away our sons and daughters in a fool’s gambit?”

His voice, though calm, carried the unmistakable reverb of a commander who mourn every soldier lost under their command.



\-“Do not mistake necessary orders for callousness or blindness.”



Astrid’s hands fell to her sides and she slightly leaned forward as she, with a hint remorse in her tone, interjected.



\-”Forgive me My Lord, I choose my words poorly if they led you to believe, that the intent behind them was to convey any doubt in the motivations behind your orders and decisions. I only”



Thorsson turned and faced Astrid, his expression harbouring signs of a smile



\-”Any one of sane mind would question the fact that so many are sacrificed for so seemingly little ground. I can not fault you for this ”



\-”However we should count the stars for our luck, that we managed to force this conflict into one of static warfare and containment for as long as we have.”



\-“The Turmund Ridge will not fall to brute strength alone.”



\-”What I’m about to tell you is a warning order, I trust you with this information because you and your men will be asked to play a crucial role in the coming weeks, and you will need time to prepare.”



He gestured to the map, where new symbols flickered into place, markers of hidden mine entrances and forgotten tunnels revealed by scouting parties.



\- “Our forward engineers have found remnants of an ancient mining network beneath the ridge. The Lions men , for all their ingenuity, seem to be unaware of what lies below them. We shall use these tunnels to place charges beneath them.”



Astrids’s brow furrowed.



\-“A calculated risk, my lord. If the enemy discovers us?”



\-“They will not,” Torsson interrupted, his voice ironclad.



\-”I have personally overseen the selection of the men for the saboteur groups, once the charges are detonated we will unleash a cavalcade of violence, sung in by the roar of a million artillery shells! ”



Thorsson’s eyes rested for a moment on the piercing gaze of Falkenholm.



\-”I need J Company to, get across no man's land, unseen. Lay in wait, just out of range of our artillery, just beyond Hill 275. Once our artillery barrage begins, there will be a 5 minutes countdown, then Hill 275 will be excluded form the barrage. This will be your window to seize or destroy the mortars and machine gun positions on that hill. If J company manages to hold Hill 275 during the main assault, you will create a thin gap beyond Stumblers Hill and along Bloods Creek, for the 15^(th) Asanders Brigade and the 6^(th) Mechanised Division to approach and assault Turmund Ridge from, with significantly reduced estimated casualties.”



He paused for a moment placed his hands on the edge of the strategical planning table and lowered his head.



\-”Once you have taken the hill; Your main objective is to hold it and restrict the enemies ability to pin down the 6^(th) Mechanised and the 15^(th) Asanders Brigade. And if you do manage to capture any offensive equipment, I want you to try and create as much havoc within their lines as possible. But, and I mean this, Do not proceed any further or join the rest of the assault. There will be 2 Mechanised Divisions and 12 infantry brigades participating in this operation. You are my surgical instruments don’t let the tide of violence dull your edges. I have plenty of hammers and rocks, but few sharp knifes.”



She raised her right hand to her right eyebrow and in an almost mechanical movement, and saluted.



\-“I will see to the men”, Astrid exclaimed with a stringent voice



Thorsson nodded and haphazardly saluted back and added,



\-”Let me know if there is anything you will need.”

Astrid turned, and with rejuvenated seal left the command bunker.



Field Marshal Johannes Thorsson sat down to review the latest situation reports from the other theatres. He had been there, when the envoy had addressed the planetary council. The Envoy had spoken about unification, threat of human annihilation from aliens, and the divinity of their king, the Lion. All lies he was sure of it. When subjugation had been refused, their planetfall had been almost immediate. Johannes remembered being surprised at how the worlds regions, seemingly in a single breath, had managed forget all past squabbles and scramble their forces in a united effort try to contain the invaders. That was four years ago, an still no end to the war in sight. He did not want to admit it to himself but deep down, a kernel of doubt had sprung root. At this point it was impossible that the forces and resupplies making daily planetfall would not be reinforcements from a main force. Even so, how the expeditionary contingent could have sustained such warfare for such an extended period eluded his comprehension.



Was there any validity to the claims the envoy had made? , he thought to himself. Before quickly suppressing his doubts.



\-”They might have pushed this dog in to a corner, but they will soon become acutely aware of just how hard it can bite.” Thorsson said under his breath.









As Astrid made her way through the meandering trenches she was halted by a procession of wounded, slowly making their way back towards the forward surgical field hospital

solemnly she moved through the swaying and limping mass, it’s repeating ebbs and flows agitated only by the the occasional stretcher bearer teams frantic movements.

On her way though the procession towards one of the non arterial trench systems, she came a upon a small statued figure sitting towards the mud wall of the trench. His arm and hand stretched out as if he was waiting on someone to grab it.



Astrid’s purposivety normally unwavering, yielded. She took the grasping hand in hers, letting it rest as if it was a wounded dove in the palm of her hand. Slowly the head of the small statued figure rose. Revealing the mutilated face of a very young man. Both his eyes shot through, their torn remains now mixed with eyelashes and skin



\-”I’ lost my way, can you help me?”

The boy asked calmly



Astrid could see the markings left by the medic, “why had he been deemed ‘will not survive’ ”she thought to her self.



\- “ it’ts alright, son”



\-“I… I can’t see, Ma’am, Wi wi will, I need an operation”



\-”Poor boy, he doesn’t know he never will” she thought to her self.



From the far end of the trench section a large soldier carrying two large ammunition cases hastily rounded the corner , his steps teetering on running and leaning forward as if each step stopped him from falling over.



Astrid threw out her free arm and grabbed him by his shoulder.



His momentum almost pulling Astrid with him, as he tried to stop without losing his balance.

The soldier turned towards Astrid with an exasperate expression, that slowly turned into one of surprise.



\-“Take this man to the forward surgical field hospital, and make sure he gets treated!”



The large soldier looked at the wounded man, then back at Astrid. His gaze began rapidly shifting in an erratic pattern betraying the struggle between the thoughts in his head. Just as he was about to open his mouth to speak, Astrid cut him off.



\-”I understand, you already have orders. That's self evident, unless you are running around with ammunition cases for fun. If the field hospital is further away than where ever you are going with those boxes, then drop them of on the way.”



\-”Yes ma’am, ” the soldier replied sheepishly.



The soldier moved the Ammunition box from his left hand to under his right arm, and leaned down towards the wounded young man.



\- “I’m Thomas, you want to come with me? I’ll take you to the medics , and they can get you patched up. ” He asked with a soft voice.



The wounded soldier nodded.

And as and Astrid and Thomas helped him up he said:



\- “I’m Bernard, but my buddies call me Nard.”



The two men slowly made their along the trench.



\-”Why do they call you Nard?” Thomas asked.



\-”One time our Sergeant, got so mad at me, he forgot the first part of my name when he yelled at me. I guess it sort of stuck.”



\-”What did you do to get your sarge so mad?”



The two rounded the corner of the south end of the trench, Astrid stood still for a moment longer trying to hear the reply, but they were now to far away for her to hear much more than the melody of their speech on top of the wind, distant rumbling of engines and artillery.







There was an aura of unease in the company command post. They were all waiting, waiting on a specific date and time. But no one knew which time or day they where waiting on. J Company had now gone over their battle plans multiple times a day. They had made contingency plans for seemingly every possible situation and drilled every last scenario almost to the point of absurdity.

Astrid observed the member of her staff, some where pacing the room, or continually shifting in their chairs, others picked their nails or at some small piece of scab on their hands. Every one showed signs of being anxious, all except Private Julian Baumhauer. Built like an Oak and often just as stoic, that man could fall a sleep just about anytime, anywhere. Astrid would be lying if she didn’t say she was at least a little jealous of him. An hour earlier Astrid had been given the final order, in about 34 hours they were expected to be in position just beneath Hill 275. She had not told the rest of the company or her subordinates, she wanted them to get the opportunity to have tonight's supper with relative piece of mind. Astrid got up, and walked over to the small stove in the corner of the room to refill her coffee mug.

She slowly turned towards the room, while blowing on the coffee and carefully testing the heat with her lips.



Between her breaths as she continued blowing on the coffee, she announced to the room;



\-”In 15 minutes I want every Platoon and squad leader in here for orders, and before you ask. Yes! we’re doing this thing.”



The previous feeling of unease filling the room was quickly replaced by a sense of duty, and the commotion people moving with purpose.

Astrid stood still, slowly drinking her coffee as the chaos around her slowly settled into order. Eventually the only movement in the room was her arm as she moved the mug to and from her lips, in front of her stood 35 officers in silent anticipation. She sat the mug aside and pulled back the sleeve on her left arm with her middle- and ring finger, revealing her watch. Astrid’s eyes focused on the watch face for a moment before her eyes started trailing the second hand.



\-”The time is 17:32.15 now…… 17.32. 25 …….. now ”



Everyone in the room quickly turned their gaze from Astrid to their respective watches, as they continued to listen to her declaring the time.



Astrid Continued;



\-“17:32. 40 …… now, 17:33. 00 ……. Now. Does any one need additional time giving or are we all synced?”



\-”Good!”



\-” As you all know, we have been tasked with taking Hill 275, Our assault plays crucial part for the success of Operation Spetum. I was informed that our Field Marshal decided on that name earlier this week, quite fitting in my opinion”

The listeners nodded in agreement.



\-”Now, The enemy holds Hill 275, from now referred to as THE HILL, They are entrenched and have multiple fortified, short range artillery positions and Machine gun nests. Enemy strength is estimated to be company sized. Possibly a dedicated communications platoon as well, either on, or in very close proximity to THE HILL. It’s imperative that we cut any communication lines and capture any radio equipment. The trench systems just to the North and south of THE HILL are fortunately for us not directly connected with the entrenchments on THE HILL due to the steepness of its sides. There are however two Trenches leading up the hill from the east, or from behind THE HILL. These will be referred to as INDEX and MIDDLE, and we need to get a vantage point over these as soon as possible, once we have established our presence. Our Company’s main objective is to open up a safe gap along Bloods Creek for the forces storming Turmund Ridge to approach through. Us holding THE HILL will not completely remove the enemies ability to fire down Bloods Creek, but it will no longer be a shooting gallery. This means we will need to engage down into the trench systems and other firing positions, from our position. Hopefully with captured artillery. Once the main spearhead of our forces, that will be barrelling right into the centre of the enemy frontlines, has breached the second line of trenches. We will change our focus to give them supporting fire. If we are unable to hold The HILL ,we are to destroy as much of their equipment as possible and hinder their ability to utilize the position.”



\-”Now for some specifics. We depart tomorrow evening once the sun has set”



\-“Our approach will be veiled by the storm that is expected to hit tomorrow evening, with a little luck it will begin just after dark, giving us extra time to move slowly and hidden through the night. Then at 4:30 we have to be in position just beneath THE HILL. Once the first salvo of our artillery barrage is fired, the countdown begins. FIVE minutes, then our objective will be excluded from the barrage.



The rest of the barrage will continue for another 35 minutes, before switching over to a creeping barrage, marking the start of the main assault. This will give us a 35 minute window take the THE HILL. The quicker and quieter we can seize it, the greater the chance that we can await the approach of the main assault in relative peace.”



\-”Questions?”



A single hand rose form the group.



\-”Yes!”, Astrid said while nodding in the direction lieutenant with the raised hand.



\-” Will there be radio silence through out the, entirety of the operation?”, the lieutenant asked with a short brisk tone.



\-”Until we can be sure that they are aware of our presence, we will hold radio silence. Any communication between platoons will have to be done with runners in the meantime, if absolutely necessary. Any communication back to HQ will be done with RCP-Drones.”

Astrid scanned the room looking for any other raised hands or facial expressions that conveyed confusion.



\-”If there are no other questions, You are all dismissed. Now go and make sure the men are ready for tomorrow.”



A loud CLACK rang out as every pair of boots in the room smacked together in unison. Then the crowd of officers dispersed and left the room, synchronized like a flock of swimming ducks entering a lake from a narrow stream.





The next day evening, there was a bustling through out the trench systems. Every soldier, platoon and company seemed to have very pressing orders to attend to, and preparations to make.

J Company however stood as a cohesive unit, just waiting. For the last half hour the wind had been steadily picking up, and even thicker and darker clouds slowly moved in over the battlefield.

The winds were blowing perpendicular to the trench in which, J Company was waiting, insulating them from the biting chill of the wind. But it howled at them as it passed over the trench.

As every shadow grew with the setting of the sun, so did they dim. The cloud cover was so thick, that as the horizon still shifted through the colours of fire and blood. The ground had already been painted with the darkest of ink.

A hand was raised, and the Company proceeded to exit the trench in six columns. Through the night they battled the biting wind and occasional hail as they slowly made their way over the ravaged landscape, filled with wreckages, deep craters, pieces of barbed wire, and the torn bodies of those who had found their final resting place violently and sudden.

Some craters were so deep that they had to climb up their edges in pairs. The closer they got to the hill the slower they had to move, eventually resorting to crawling. Because the temperature had crept so low that the mud began to freeze making the ground crackle under their boots. Although the wind was still blowing so ferociously that all but the loudest of screams would be drowned out. They did not dare, risk a sudden lull in the storm betraying their approach.



Astrid’s entire body ached from the strain and cold. The cold steel on her rifle burning her chin as she tried resting her neck in between shuffles, as she crawled under a group of fallen logs. As she cleared the last log and looked up, their objective suddenly loomed over her barely visible in the dim light from the enemy encampments scattered and reflected against the low clouds and thin fog.



She looked back and quietly said to her platoon deputy.



\-”We’re here, tell the men to get them self in to position and ready. We are quite early so if they need some rest, now would be the time to try and get some.”



Grouped together in their platoons all of J Company, laid pressed against a half frozen mudbank, concealed from the Lion’s forces and shielded from the worst of the weather.



In an instance the horizon behind them lit up as if the clouds had ignited. Then came the roar, indescribably loud the hail of artillery fire came raining down all along the frontline. Plumes of mud, stone and fire spewed up like erupting volcanos. The explosions ripping apart the ground and and setting fortifications a blaze. In between the near constant and deafening explosions the screams of the next incoming shells was all that could be heard.



Private Wilkes, adjusted the strap of his helmet and clutched his rifle. He could feel his heart pounding, the thump in his chest almost visible through his uniform jacket. Just Beside him, Sergeant Lewis checked his wristwatch. The older man’s expression of grim determination, reinforced by his heavily scarred face.



\-”Two minutes ” Lewis growled, his voice rough like gravel.



Wilkes looked down along the mudbank most of the platoons were sporadically visible to as the fire raining down, illuminated the landscape. He could see their Company commander Capitan Falkenholm crouched down and looking just as intently at her wristwatch as his Sergeant.



\-”Thirty Seconds”



Everyone shifted around and secured their footing, leaned up towards the edge of the bank and stood in a stance reminiscent of a predator ready to pounce.



\-”Ten seconds.. seven, six ……. four, three, two”



”Move! Move! Move!” Astrid barked as the barrage crept away from the THE HILL. The men leaped over the edge of the bank, weapons ready.

The climb was brutal from the outset. The ground was a morass of half frozen mud, jagged rocks and boulders . And the wind carried flakes of razor sharp snow, that cut in to their faces. The first obstacle was the barbed wire, stretched in stacked lines across the slope. Explosions from the barrage had torn gaps in some places, but in others, the wire remained intact, a deadly barrier.



”Wire cutters, up front!” Sergeant Lewis shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos.



Corporal Larsen darted forward, his hands working frantically as he snipped at the wire. The sharp twang of severed strands was drowned out by the barrage still hammering all along the front. As Lewis and the men of his platoon made their way through the rows of barbed wire, other parts of the company had, had better luck with the artillery clearing their paths. And some of them where already half way up the slope and had began fanning out. Just as Lewis got clear of the barbed wire, he could see that Falkenholm had stopped about half way up The Hill and was frantically signalling with her hands. A runner came stumbling down towards them, sliding and hopping down the muddy hill side.







\-”There are firing positions in the hill side! They have dug out, the whole hill might have tunnels,Captain wants your and 5^(th) platoon to breach and clear from the inside while the rest of us continue clear THE HILL from the top! ”. The runner exclaimed while trying to catch his breath



Sergeant Lewis nodded and turned to his platoon.



\-”Alright boys, looks like we are going caving, on me!” Sergeant Lewis said with his raspy voice.



Just as Astrid turned to continue the ascend there was a crack followed by the zip of bullets as a machine guns opened fire.

”Down! Find cover!” Astrid bellowed.

She threw herself into a shell crater as a burst of fire kicked up dirt near her face. She dared a glance over the edge, spotting the muzzle flashes from a machine gun nest partially concealed behind sandbags.



\-”Baumhauer!” Astrid yelled. “Take it out!”



Private Julian Baumhauer, nodded grimly. Clutching a grenade, he dashed forward , darting between cover, the machine gun crackling as it tracked him. A round clipped his thigh, and he stumbled but didn’t stop. With a roar, he hurled the grenade into the nest before collapsing behind a boulder. The explosion sent debris and bodies flying, silencing the gun.



\-”Push on!” Astrid screamed.



As they advanced, they encountered the first artillery position: a pair of short-barreled howitzers nestled together in a concrete emplacement. The gunners, stunned by the barrage and the sudden appearance of infantry, reached for their rifles too late. On top of the Hill there was obvious signs of confusion among the enemy. Some were running to re-man their positions, while others frantically tried to get in side of their bunker entrances again to respond to the fighting now raging inside their tunnels. In the chaos and confusion a moment of respite appeared for Astrid, to survey the situation.



\-”Fuck. Matthews! Where’s Baumhauer?” Astrid shouted while hastily looking back and forth over the parapet surrounding the artillery position.



\-”He got hit while clearing the machine gun position Ma’am, Forseti is tending to him they’re still on the hill side.” Mathews replied.



\-”This is taking to long, we need to cut off those who have managed to get them self into defensible positions from reinforcements. And force the rest of them into the bunker system. By the sounds of it 2^(nd) and 5^(th) are wreaking havoc down there. Any one trying to escape we can cut down by setting up firing positions there and there. Two machine gun groups would be able to hold those entrances. That will free up most of 3^(rd) ,4^(th) and 6^(th) can set up defensive positions looking over INDEX and MIDDLE.”



\-”Yes Ma’am ”





\-”Wilkes, On me! Get this thing loaded!”

Wilkes scrambled to help Lewis in the dimly lit corridor, his hands trembling as he armed and shoved a shell into the breech of the Sergeants shoulder fired grenade rifle. The gun roared, its shell slamming a hole through the wall as the round obliterated the hastily constructed machine gun position, at the far en of the corridor, in a spray of smoke and shrapnel.

The defenders firing desperately to hold the line. Machine guns roaring, rifle fire snapped and ricochets bouncing of walls with high pitched tangs, around the advancing men. The final push was a bloody and grueling melee. Eventually the intensity of the fighting gradually died down, the further up the bunker system they came. The sustained adrenaline secretion and stress had Wilkes in tears as he forced his trembling body past yet another corner. A bullet whizzed past his head and he threw him self on the ground. A familiar voice shouted in the distance



\-”Wilkes! Is that you?”



\-”Yes! It’s me. Hold your fire”, he replied with a trembling voice.



\-”You bastards, you made it!”, the voice replied



\-”Now get up here, The main act is about to begin.”



Wilkes collected him self and got up of the bloodstained concrete floor. His Sergeant, Sergeant Lewis padded him on his shoulder as the remainder of 2^(nd) Platoon made their way up the stairs.



Hill 275 was now firmly in the hands of J Company, yet the battle was just about to begin.

Should I Pursue an MBA or a PhD? Seeking Advice as an Indian Professional looking at the M7s. ,MBA,1i4rv8g,2025-01-19 01:00:10,0,0.25,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1i4rv8g/should_i_pursue_an_mba_or_a_phd_seeking_advice_as/,BookkeeperAdept9451,Profile Review,"Hi Reddit! I’m at a crossroads in my career and would love your advice. I’m an Indian professional with a diverse profile and am exploring whether an MBA, a PhD, or another path would be best for my long-term goals.

Here’s a bit about me:

Work Experience: I’ve been working in an up-and-coming Asia advisory and corporate services firm for 3.5 years in - (my firm was initially boutique Indian consulting firm focused on India market Entry and expansion advisory, merged with the Asian advisory firm). Rose through the ranks and currently in middle management. 

I’ve helped international companies enter Asia, focusing on strategy development, ecosystem development, and implementation. Made the pivot now to also do active sales and international business development
My projects have included manufacturing plant setup (think Build vs. Buy vs. Acquisition analysis, manufacturing transitions from China to Vietnam and India), regulatory navigation, and end-to-end operational support working directly with CXOs and management teams. I am now also co-leading the establishment of a Strategy SBU in the firm with the Partner I work with.

Undergraduate Education: Chemical Engineering Degree from a Tier 2 Indian college 

Research Background: Additionally as part of the frims thought leadership, I worked with two prominent US professors (non-M7/T20 but well-regarded in their fields) on research focused on internationalization and strategy, which aligns closely with my professional interests.

Passions and Future Goals: I’m deeply interested in strategy, operations, and investment (particularly PE/VC) particularly focused on International Business areas. My dream is to transition into higher-level strategic roles or the investment space where I can create practical, long-term impact.


Here’s my dilemma:

1. MBA Path

Pros: A fast track to leadership roles, global exposure, networking, and a likely jump in earning potential.

Cons: The financial investment is substantial (~$15k USD salary makes it hefty). Plus, uncertainties around the job market, H1B visa prospects make the ROI less clear.

2. PhD Path

Pros: Offers the chance to dive deep into topics like internationalization strategies and organizational behavior. With scholarships/stipends, the financial burden is lower.

Cons: Longer time commitment with maybe potentially lower short-term earning potential compared to an MBA. Also, academic roles may not align with my goal of transitioning into investment or PE/VC.

3. Alternatives?

Should I stick with the industry and grow through experience instead?

Are there certifications (e.g., CFA, PMP) or specialized short programs that would add more value given my profile?

I’m torn because while I value learning and development, I also need to ensure that the move justifies the financial and career investment. I’m open to insights from anyone who’s navigated a similar decision, especially around MBA vs. PhD for career transitions into strategy or investments.

Thanks in advance for your advice!! "
Haul: first mini and a charming surprise,TheHermesGame,1i4rrb5,2025-01-19 00:53:18,161,0.97,17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4rrb5,onegraycat,:birkin-faubourg: Handbags,"I was only intending to pick up a pair of Oasis Sandals but it never quite works that way does it 😆 This is my second time shopping with this SA and she’s been really delivering so far! About a week ago I asked if they get any Pegase charms and she said quite rarely. When I went in for our appointment, she told me she had something to show me, and when she opened the box I was instantly in love with the colors - Gold with Rose Darling and Juane Milton!

We were talking about my preference for light and pastel colors and then she asked if I might be interested in an Evelyne. It’s not something I’ve told her but I’ve been interested in Evelynes in cute colors. So when I tried on this mini in Bleu Glacier I was sold. 

Any suggestions for twilly pairing?"
Chapter 23: Brand New Friends,stevenuniverse,1i4rmxr,2025-01-19 00:45:30,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/1i4rmxr/chapter_23_brand_new_friends/,TransformersFan077,Fanfic,"Steven sits down, Sumo sits next to Steven, grabs some pens, and starts coloring in the letters of his name. Steven put stars around his name, Clarence put stickers around him, and Jeff left his blank.

""Akright class, my name is Miss. Amin, And I will be your teacher."" She said, picking up a back Expo marker from the whiteboard and writing her name out for the class. Steven sees today's date on the board as well, written in blue Expo marker on the corner of the whiteboard.

Steven sees Miss. Amin turns around and walks to her desk. ""Okay guys, this is a little worksheet to get to know your neighbors a little bit better,"" she said, walking around the classroom and handing them out. Steven put his name up at the top and started.

The class was finished, and Miss Amin collected the worksheets and put them on her desk.

""Alright, guys, Who will come up first?""

""I want to!"" Sumo said, standing up and running towards the whiteboard. The teacher gave him his worksheet, Sumo cleared his throat and read off his worksheet.

""I am Ryan Sumouski My favorite subject is science, In school, I am good at making my friends laugh. Outside of school, I am good at drawing. Something you should know about me is. That I live with my nine brothers.

And Steven asked me if I liked space movies and I said yes, Clarence asked me if I wanted to go on vacation. And I said that I would like to go to San Diego with my two older brothers Tanner and Joseph.""

""My name is Jeff Randall and My favorite subject is science too, In school I am good at school. Outside of school, I am good at organizing. Something you should know about me is. That I live with my two mothers.

And Steven asked me what is your favorite thing to do, Well. Steven, I like to have fun with you guys and draw, Clarence asked me if I want to go on vacation too. And I said that I would like to go to Florida with my mothers.""

""Very good, Jeff. Now it's Steven's turn. Then I can tell you all mine.""

""I am Steven Universe My favorite subject is writing, In school I am good at helping my friends and others. Outside of school, I am good at music. Something you should know about me is. That I moved here from Delaware

Clarence and Sumo asked me if I had ever been to space before and I said no, And Jeff asked me if I wanted to be an actor. And I said, yes, I want to I think that would be so much fun to star in my own cartoon.""

""Very good, Steven. I'm up."" Miss Amin said, getting up and telling everyone hers.

A boy raised his hand. ""Yes, Tim?""

""Where are you from, Miss. Amin?""

""I am from the country of Palestine,"" she said. The class gasped in wonder.

""I heard on the news your people were kicked out or something."" A boy said, Steven looked at the boy who was occupied with playing his PSP.

Steven turned his head to the voice and the half-gem saw a short and chubby boy with a mop of curly brown hair. He wears a Persian red T-shirt, blue shorts, and navy shoes. He also has a unibrow and a long red nose, Steven thought that he was a character from The Muppets if he wasn't human.

Miss. Amin cleared her throat, feeling uncomfortable now. ""Um… Could we please change the topic?"" she asked the boy.

""Yeah, Belson! Be quiet!"" Sumo said. Steven and Clarence both laugh.

""Whatever…"" The boy by the name of Belson said as he went back to playing his PSP.

""Alright, settle down guys. Now, we are going into reading."" She said as she grabbed some books from her desk. Steven took one and read the cover. 'The Secret Of Superhero Academy.'

Steven's eyes widened and went starry. He'd never read this book before. He'd read others but not this one.

The class had free time now, Steven was talking with one of the new kids. Gregory. ""That's so cool that you play instruments. When did you learn?""

""When I was three."" Greg was wide-eyed.

""Three? Woah!"" he said.

""Yeah, I have a gift. My dad used to be a musician and I learn faster than any other kid because my mom learns fast."" Steven says, Greg nods.

""Hey, Steven. Can you teach me how to play guitar?"" he asked.

""Sure! I can bring my ukulele in tomorrow, and I'll teach you at recess."" Steven said. The boy smiles and puts his hands on the table.

""So, you want to be an actor?"" he asked. Steven nods.

""Heck yeah, I do!"" he said.

""Wait, you're the boy who was singing on YouTube!"" he said, amazed. Steven giggled and blushed. He wasn't used to getting praise like this. ""You know, the CEO of Cartoon Network complimented me about that when I visited.

""Woah!"" Greg asked. Steven nods and smiles.

…

Steven was at lunch, Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo were all sitting at a table, Steven took out his lunch which was a substitute for fried chicken.

""What's that?"" Sumo asked as Steven took out a fork and knife.

""Oh, it's a substitute for fried chicken, it's a cut-up mushroom dipped in the stuff you make breaded chicken,"" he explained.

""Can I try?"" Clarence asked.

""Sure,"" Steven said, cutting off a piece and giving it to him. 

…

At the end of the school day, They were all walking, Steven saw a girl walking across the street. Then a car speeding by, Steven sees the car inching closer The half gem dropped his backpack, Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo see it. Steven ran to the road to push the girl out of the way, causing her to fall onto the sidewalk.

""Are you okay? you were about to get hit."" Steven said

""Thank you."" the girl said, Steven looks at her. A young female, Steven guessed that she would be Indian, or African American with dark brown skin and a slim figure, and is slightly taller than Steven. She has a prominent nose, black eyes, thick eyebrows, and dark brown puffy hair that varies in length.

She wore a blue T-shirt and white shorts with white and red Converse.

""No problem, what's your name?"" he asked.

""I'm, Connie. I moved here a few weeks ago. you're the boy with the red shirt who hangs out with the three boys."" She glanced at Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo who were waiting across the street. Jeff held onto Steven's red star backpack by the strap.

""Are you in Miss. Amin's class?"" Steven asked her. She nods.

""I am.""

""Wait, you're the one who likes fantasy and playing the violin, right?""

""Yeah,"" she said. Steven smiles.

""Hey, Steven!"" Clarence yells from across the street. Connie looks at the three boys.

""Oh, coming! Hey, you wanna come with us too?"" he asked.

""Sure, where are we going though?"" Connie asked.

""Wherever the wind takes us!"" Clarence said. She smiles.

""Okay! Let's go!""

…

""Mom! I'm back, and I brought some friends over!"" Clarence said, coming through the back of the house by the sliding glass door. Steven sees who appears to be his mother, a curvy woman with pink skin and blonde hair. Wearing a pale yellow t-shirt and tight pink pants with dark brown boots. She also wears red lipstick.

""Oh, hello! who are they?"" His mother asked, seeing both Steven and Connie.

""I'm, Steven and this is Connie. I met her while saving her from almost getting hit by a car,"" he said. Connie nods in approval. Steven sat on the bar stool, his hands resting on the pink-tiled countertop. Steven took out his phone and saw there were no texts from his dad or the Gems, he smiled in relief.

Pearl would've been texting him nonstop by now wondering where he was at. But, Rose did say that she was not his parent. So, that is a plus.

""Clarence, do you and your friends want some leftover sushi?""

""Yeah!"" Clarence, Jeff, Sumo, and Connie said, Steven looked up.

""Um…Excuse me, do you have anything vegetarian?"" the hybrid asked her.

""Mmmm, let me see what I have…"" she said, looking in the fridge, rummaging through it, looking for something that he could have. She poked her head out and grabbed some celery sticks and peanut butter.

""I have this, you want this?"" she asked. Steven nods.

""Uh, what's your name by the way?"" he asks.

""I'm Mary,"" she said, Steven nods.

""Hi, Mary,"" he said, shaking her hand.

She smiles and proceeds to make Steven his snack.

Mary places Steven's snack in front of him, He picks one up and takes a bite. They hear the door open. A man walks into the house.

The man has a very ape-like appearance, with shoulder-length brown hair and permanent stubble. The man is very tan with big, hairy arms. He's wearing a white T-shirt and black pants.

""Hey, Chad. Your home early."" Mary tells her boyfriend, as he kisses her on the cheek.

""The shop wasn't as busy, so I closed up early.""

""What does he do again, Mary?"" Jeff asked.

""He owns a music store in downtown LA."" she reminded Jeff.

""Coool! My dad worked at a music store back home,"" Steven said. ""But now, he's trying to look for a job.""

""Oh, what happened?"" Mary asked.

""His house caught fire in Delaware three days ago, so he's living here now to be closer to his family and friends,"" Jeff explained. She nodded as Steven ate the rest of his celery and peanut butter.

""If he's looking for a job, I can hook him up. You know, I can always use more help."" Chad said, handing Steven a black business card.

""Chad's music store."" Steven read off the card, the boy put it in his pocket and gave him a thumbs up towards the man.

""Bye, Steven. I'll see you tomorrow!"" Clarence said Steven and Rose were going back to Misty's and Tony's house. Rose was driving Greg's van. ""How was your first day of school, Steven?""

""I loved it, oh! and I have this card. Dad can work at a music store like he did back home! And I met a girl, who almost got hit by a car. I saved her though."" Steven said. Rose put a hand on his curly hair.

""You are very compassionate, Steven."" his mother said, Steven blushed and smiled. They arrived back at Tony and Misty's house. Steven walks in and puts his backpack by the door.

Steven walked into the bathroom with his PJ pants and a Star Wars T-shirt to take a shower.

Dinner was over, Steven was in bed, and he felt warm under the covers as he drifted to sleep.

…

*He was surrounded by a home on fire, the smoke from the burning wood was making him cough and wheeze. Steven sees a beam fall and tries to duck out of the way, Steven's hands, arms, and legs are black from the ash.*

*Steven's heart raced as he knew where he was.*

*He was in his home in Delaware.*

*Steven ran into the living room, he saw Greg on the couch, limp. ""Dad, Dad!"" Steven yelled out, running towards him as he coughed violently as smoke filled his lungs.*

*Steven tried to pick him up and drag him out but couldn't. He then hears a noise. The boy lifted his head and saw a burning beam fall on both of them, Steven's mind raced with questions. How did this happen? Who would do this? and…*

*Where was his mother?*

…

Steven's eyes shot open, he bolted up and started breathing heavily. Tears welled in his eyes as he wiped them with the back of his hand. He wasn't sure about waking his parents for a dumb problem like this, but…. He sighed, Steven peeled the covers back, opened the door, and went to his father's room.

Steven sees both his parents asleep while holding each other. The hybrid stepped onto the carpeted floor and shook his father's shoulder.

""Dad…"" he said. Greg opens his eyes and rolls over and sees his son.

""Steven? What are you doing up?"" he asked yawning, rubbing his eyes.

""Um…. I had a nightmare, can I sleep with you guys?"" he asked.

Greg smiled at his son. ""Of course, Buddy,"" he said, scooting over and letting him in. The boy went in. Immidely his body was swallowed up with his father's warmth. Steven slowly closed his eyes and went to sleep."
God Four,u_craiggroshek,1i4l0lr,2025-01-18 18:57:03,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_craiggroshek/comments/1i4l0lr/god_four/,craiggroshek,,"I found the journal while the foundation for my new home was being dug. It was lodged beneath a pile of rubble, wrapped in what looked like oil-stained canvas. The foreman waved it off as junk, but something about it caught my eye—maybe it was the odd way it was buried, or the fact that the canvas looked pristine despite the decay around it. Whatever the reason, I kept it.

The journal itself is... unsettling. The leather cover is cracked, but the pages are remarkably intact, filled with dense handwriting that seems rushed, like the author was racing against time. Every word feels heavy, as though the writer—someone named Elias Grayson—was desperate to preserve what he knew.

At first, I thought it was some sort of elaborate prank. The entries describe events so surreal, so apocalyptic, that they couldn’t possibly be true. But the details are vivid and precise, written with the kind of intensity you don’t fake easily. And then there’s the journal itself—it looks old, but not ancient. A relic of recent history, not centuries past. The paper is modern enough to suggest someone like me could’ve written it. The ink hasn’t even faded.

The strangest thing? There’s no record of an Elias Grayson. No birth certificates, no job history, nothing in the archives. Yet his account feels too real to dismiss outright. If he’s a fabrication, someone went to extraordinary lengths to craft him—and for what? To scare a random stranger who happened to dig up a piece of rubble? The implications are... haunting.

Now I don’t know what to believe. If what Elias describes is true, then everything—our reality, the stars above, the ground beneath our feet—is fragile. If it’s a hoax, then someone with a twisted mind left this journal to haunt anyone who found it. Either way, the account terrifies me.

What follows are the details exactly as Elias wrote them. I haven’t edited a word, though I’ve had to stop reading more than once to catch my breath. Whether you believe it or not is up to you. I just hope that, if this is some elaborate joke, it’s nothing more than that.

**THE JOURNAL OF ELIAS GRAYSON**

My name is Elias Grayson, and until five years ago, I believed in God. Not the vague, modernist platitude of some benevolent creator, nor the cynical skepticism of a philosopher hedging his bets; I believed in a God with capital letters, the Almighty, the Father, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. I was a priest—until I wasn’t.

There’s a saying that science and faith are enemies, but I never saw it that way. My faith drove me to science. I wanted to understand how the mechanics of creation worked. Where others saw contradiction, I saw harmony. God set the stars spinning, I told my parishioners, and physics is the language He wrote it in.

But the Church disagreed.

It began with my papers—long, detailed treatises blending theology and cosmology, proposing that the Big Bang could be seen as divine fiat, and quantum mechanics as proof of a creator’s fingerprints. I thought I was building bridges, but my superiors saw heresy. They demanded a retraction. When I refused, they escalated. I was excommunicated six months later.

My faith didn’t survive the betrayal.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

Five years after leaving the collar behind, I was working in the astronomy department of a small university. My days were spent juggling grant proposals and lecturing undergrads who cared more about passing exams than looking at the stars. It was a quieter life, but a hollow one.

That’s when *they* came.

I remember the man who approached me clearly—probably because everything about him felt like a caricature of clandestine government types. He had the black suit, the mirrored sunglasses, and the stiff gait of someone who had never blended in anywhere. He didn’t introduce himself.

“Dr. Grayson?”

“Yes.”

“You’re requested for a classified project. It’s an opportunity that aligns with your unique expertise. May I sit?”

He didn’t wait for permission, lowering himself into the chair opposite my desk and sliding a sleek black folder toward me.

“Who are you?” I asked, keeping my voice calm despite my apprehension.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he gestured toward the folder. “You’ll find everything you need in there. Read it carefully. If you’re interested, there’s a car waiting outside.”

It wasn’t a request, and the weight in his tone carried more authority than the Church ever had.

The folder was unmarked, but its contents were anything but ordinary. Diagrams of strange machines, photographs of ancient manuscripts, and a single question scrawled in bold type across the top page:

*Does God exist?*

There were other pages, too, detailing the terms of the project—security clearances, a staggering salary, and a clause that essentially signed my life away. It was absurd, like something from a spy novel. But the question lingered in my mind.

I had spent my life trying to reconcile science and faith. Here was an opportunity to chase the ultimate answer. I’d told myself I didn’t care anymore, but at that moment, I realized the ember of my curiosity had never fully died.

I didn’t need much time to decide. By the time I walked out of my office, the black sedan was waiting at the curb.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The facility was somewhere in the mountains, though I couldn’t tell you where. The car’s windows were tinted too dark to see through, and when we arrived, they blindfolded me before leading me inside. It was a strange combination of high-tech sterility and gothic architecture—labs bristling with equipment sat beside halls lined with statues and murals of gods both familiar and obscure.

I wasn’t the only one there. The team was an eclectic mix: physicists, theologians, mystics, and even a historian specializing in pre-Abrahamic religions. They introduced themselves in clipped, professional tones. Everyone referred to me simply as “Dr. Grayson.”

After a brief orientation, I was led to my quarters—a Spartan room with a single bed, a desk, and a terminal connected to a secure network. A man in a lab coat handed me a keycard and a small tablet loaded with classified documents.

“Your first assignment,” he said, “is to familiarize yourself with the basic premise. You’ll find the term ‘God Four’ mentioned frequently. I suggest you pay close attention.”

“God Four?” I asked.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he left me standing in the hallway, clutching the tablet.

I spent that first night reading until my eyes burned. The documents were dense and unsettling, blending cutting-edge physics with references to ancient texts and rituals. At first, the premise seemed absurd: that “God” was not a singular entity but a recurring force, manifesting in different forms over eons. These manifestations were said to embody distinct divine aspects: creation, detachment, compassion, and now God Four—an iteration described as the embodiment of wrath and destruction. The project’s purpose, I learned, was to study these cycles to determine their impact on the universe and, if possible, uncover patterns that could help us understand their purpose—or prevent catastrophe.

The last file I read was a transcript of a briefing given to the project’s lead scientists.

“God Four,” the transcript read, “is the culmination of all prior cycles. It is wrath incarnate, chaos distilled. Its arrival will not be subtle. It will be catastrophic, ushering in a purge of imperfection to prepare the universe for the rebirth of Cycle One.”

The words sent a chill down my spine. Despite my cynicism, I felt something stir in me—a shadow of the faith I thought I’d abandoned. Could this be real? Could the God I’d worshipped as a priest be but one iteration of a much larger, far stranger truth?

I slept fitfully that night, haunted by fragments of scripture that now took on an ominous new meaning:

*I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.*

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The first days in the facility blurred together, a surreal mixture of cutting-edge science and ancient superstition. Every morning began with briefings that would have sounded insane to anyone outside those walls: updates on quantum field experiments, analyses of sacred particles, and progress reports on rituals reconstructed from forgotten civilizations.

My task was to bridge the two worlds, to find the common thread between the divine and the physical. The others—those mystics, theologians, and occultists—treated the supernatural as fact, while the physicists relied on data and math. I straddled the line, as I always had.

But as I dove deeper into the work, the line between science and mysticism began to blur.

The first breakthrough came three weeks in, during an experiment I had initially dismissed as pseudoscience. A team led by Dr. Lorena Choi—a theoretical physicist with an unnerving fascination for Kabbalistic symbolism—had devised a mechanism they called the Resonance Array. The device was a monstrous hybrid of particle accelerators and arcane symbols, designed to detect anomalies in quantum fields.

The idea, according to Lorena, was simple: if God had ever acted upon the universe, traces of those actions might still exist, embedded in the fabric of reality.

“It’s like finding fingerprints at a crime scene,” she explained during the briefing. “Except the crime scene is existence itself.”

I was skeptical but curious. The experiment involved bombarding a sealed chamber with high-energy particles while chanting verses from the Rigveda, an ancient Hindu text. The chants, Lorena argued, served as a “metaphysical key” to unlock divine interactions.

It sounded absurd, but the results were undeniable. As the chanting reached its crescendo, the monitors spiked with data: bursts of energy that defied known physical laws. The chamber began to glow faintly, and the air hummed with an otherworldly resonance.

I stood in stunned silence as Lorena turned to me, a triumphant smile on her face. “We’re not just looking for God,” she said. “We’re touching Him.”

\* \* \* \* \* \*

That night, I reviewed the data with a growing sense of unease. The energy signatures didn’t match any known phenomenon. It was as if the universe itself had momentarily warped, responding to the experiment in ways I couldn’t explain.

The old theological debates I’d had as a priest came to mind. What if God wasn’t an omnipotent creator, but something far stranger? Something woven into the very fabric of existence, capable of manipulating it at will?

I went to bed with a throbbing headache, my mind racing with possibilities.

The days that followed brought more revelations—and more questions.

One experiment involved a 4,000-year-old Sumerian prayer tablet, which was placed in a magnetic containment field designed to amplify subtle energy patterns. As the tablet was exposed to the field, the containment chamber began to vibrate, emitting a low, guttural sound that resembled chanting.

Another test utilized a ritual dagger from an obscure Celtic sect, believed to have been used in sacrificial offerings. When placed under an electron microscope, the blade’s surface revealed microscopic inscriptions—symbols that matched those found in carvings on opposite sides of the globe.

Patterns began to emerge. Every culture, every religion, every ancient myth seemed to point to the same truth: that the divine was *real*, but *fractured*. Each piece of evidence felt like a shard of a shattered mirror, reflecting only a fragment of a much larger whole.

But the most unsettling discovery came during what we called the Divine Fragment Retrieval.

The retrieval process involved isolating and amplifying energy anomalies detected by the Resonance Array. These anomalies, Lorena theorized, were remnants of divine actions—traces left behind by past incarnations of God.

The first fragment was subtle, manifesting as a faint distortion in light patterns. The second was more pronounced, producing an audible hum that set our teeth on edge. But the third… the third was something else entirely.

It happened during a late-night session, with only a skeleton crew present. The chamber housing the Resonance Array began to glow brighter than ever before, pulsing with a rhythmic intensity. The hum grew louder, resonating deep in our bones.

And then, for a brief moment, we *saw* something.

It was impossible to describe—a shape that defied logic, folding and unfolding in ways that hurt to look at. Colors I couldn’t name swirled around it, and its surface seemed to ripple like liquid glass. I could feel its invasive presence penetrating my mind.

One of the mystics fell to his knees, muttering a prayer in a language I didn’t recognize. Lorena stared in awe, tears streaming down her face.

I couldn’t look away. For the first time in years, I felt something akin to faith—a desperate, terrifying certainty that we were in the presence of something greater than ourselves.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The aftermath of the experiment was chaotic. The shape vanished after only a few seconds, leaving behind scorched equipment and frayed nerves.

Debriefings were tense. Half the team wanted to shut down the experiments, claiming we were tampering with forces we didn’t understand. The other half, led by Lorena, argued that we were on the brink of a breakthrough.

I found myself caught in the middle. The rational part of me knew the risks were escalating, but a deeper part—the part that had once worn a priest’s collar—felt an insatiable need to continue.

I spent hours poring over the data, trying to make sense of what we’d witnessed. The patterns were clear: these fragments weren’t random. They were pieces of something larger, something coherent.

That’s when I stumbled upon an obscure file buried in the classified archives: *The Cycles of God—Advanced Analysis.*

The document didn’t rewrite what I already knew about the cycles—it deepened it. It contained data and observations that the project leads hadn’t disclosed to the team, possibly for fear of inciting panic. The file suggested that the cycles were not just sequential events but part of a self-sustaining cosmic mechanism—one designed to purge and renew existence. It also included chilling timelines and predictions: God Four’s arrival was not an abstract possibility, but a near certainty, calculated to occur within *weeks*.

The file’s final pages hinted at something even more disturbing: not all cycles followed the same patterns. Cycle Four, they suggested, was anomalous, its destructive intensity potentially surpassing anything that had come before. The implications were clear: this wasn’t just the end of a phase—it could be the end of existence as we knew it.

What made the file unsettling wasn’t its theories but its implications. The researchers who authored it had gone further than anyone else, charting the patterns of destruction that accompanied each cycle and predicting what Cycle Four would bring. Their conclusion was stark, underscored by a final, dire warning:

*Cycle Four is imminent. It will not be kind.*

The words troubled me in a way the earlier briefings hadn’t. It was one thing to discuss theory in abstract terms; it was another to see the evidence laid out so plainly, alongside the unmistakable certainty of what was to come.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My dreams twisted into a kaleidoscope of distorted shapes, fragments of scripture, and whispers I couldn’t place. They all seemed to coalesce into a single, nightmarish thought.

When I awoke, my lips moved before I even realized I was speaking: *“Behold, I make all things new.”*

The verse, straight from the Biblical *Book of Revelation*, echoed in my mind.

The words no longer felt like a promise.

They were a threat.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The mood in the facility shifted after the experiment with the third fragment. We all felt it—a mounting tension that crept into every conversation, every glance exchanged in the sterile hallways. For some, it was a thrill. For others, a quiet dread.

For me, it was both.

I buried myself in work, dissecting the data from our latest experiments and looking for patterns that might offer some sense of control. But control was an illusion. The fragments weren’t random anomalies; they were pieces of a puzzle we weren’t meant to solve.

And yet, we kept going.

The warning signs began as subtle anomalies: bursts of gamma radiation from nowhere, unexplained gravitational shifts near the facility, and a rise in seismic activity that couldn’t be attributed to any tectonic fault. The data was clear—something was building, something *massive*.

Then the dreams started.

At first, I dismissed them as stress-induced nightmares. But when I overheard two colleagues describing eerily similar visions—endless spirals of color, a voice speaking in a language that seemed older than time—I realized I wasn’t alone.

It wasn’t just dreams, either. Some team members reported auditory hallucinations: faint whispers that seemed to come from the walls or the air itself. Others claimed to see fleeting shapes in their peripheral vision, too quick to identify but impossible to ignore.

The first casualty silenced even the most skeptical among us.

Dr. Miguel Torres, a materials scientist with a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue, had been vocal about his disdain for the project’s mysticism. “God Four?” he’d scoffed during one meeting. “Sounds like the title of a bad sci-fi movie.”

No one saw what happened to him. He’d been working late in one of the isolated labs, analyzing energy signatures from the Resonance Array. When he didn’t show up for the morning briefing, a security team was sent to check on him.

What they found defied explanation.

The lab was intact, but Miguel was gone. All that remained was a scorched outline of his body on the floor, as if he’d been burned into the ground by an impossibly intense light. The security footage showed only static during the time of his disappearance.

It wasn’t long before the rumors began. Some claimed he’d been taken by God Four, a punishment for his lack of faith. Others whispered that he’d stumbled too close to the truth and been erased for it.

I didn’t know what to believe, but Miguel’s fate was a warning. That much was clear.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The final breakthrough came a week later.

Lorena and her team had been working on a method to amplify the fragments’ energy signatures, hoping to force a direct manifestation of God Four. The risks were astronomical, but desperation had overtaken caution.

“We’re running out of time,” she told me during a tense meeting. Her voice was calm, but her eyes betrayed her fear. “The signs are accelerating. If we don’t act now, we might not get another chance.”

Against my better judgment, I agreed.

The experiment took place in the main chamber, a cavernous space lined with reinforced walls and bristling with equipment. The Resonance Array had been upgraded, its circuitry glowing with an unsettling, almost organic light.

As the experiment began, I stood in the observation room, overwhelmed with anticipation and dread. Lorena and her team worked frantically at their consoles, chanting fragments of scripture alongside incomprehensible equations.

The air grew heavy, charged with an energy that made every hair on my body stand on end. The lights flickered, and the hum of the machinery rose to a deafening roar.

And then, it happened.

The chamber was suddenly bathed in a searing, otherworldly light. The monitors went wild, displaying readings that defied comprehension. And in the center of the chamber, something began to take shape.

It was impossible to describe. A mass of shifting geometries, constantly folding and unfolding upon itself, like a living fractal. Colors I’d never seen before danced across its surface, and its form seemed to pulse with a rhythm that resonated deep in my chest.

The voice followed—a soundless vibration that bypassed the ears and spoke directly to the mind.

*I AM.*

The words were simple, yet they carried a power that rivaled the intensity of a thousand stars.

Lorena collapsed to her knees, tears streaming down her face. Several others followed, their expressions a mix of awe and terror. I remained standing, though my legs felt like they might give out at any moment.

The entity’s presence was overwhelming, its consciousness pressing against mine like an ocean threatening to drown a single drop of water. And yet, I felt a strange clarity.

This was God Four.

The voice continued, resonating with an authority that left no room for doubt.

*I AM WRATH. I AM THE SCOURGE OF IMPERFECTION. I AM THE HARBINGER OF PURITY.*

Images flooded my mind—worlds burning, galaxies collapsing into themselves, life reduced to ash and dust. It wasn’t just humanity at stake; it was *everything*. The universe itself would be purged, stripped bare to make way for the next cycle.

And yet, there was a twisted logic to it. The destruction wasn’t malicious; it was *necessary*. A cleansing fire to prepare the cosmos for renewal.

I wanted to scream, to beg for mercy, but the words wouldn’t come.

*YOU WILL WITNESS. YOU WILL REMEMBER.*

The entity’s light flared, blinding and absolute. When it faded, the chamber was empty, the equipment fried, and the walls charred–but the entity was gone.

For a moment, there was silence. Then Lorena whispered, her voice trembling:

“It’s coming.”

The aftermath was chaos. Half the team quit on the spot, refusing to continue what they called a doomed endeavor. The rest of us were left to pick up the pieces, trying to make sense of what we’d unleashed.

But the signs were undeniable. The anomalies were escalating, the dreams growing more vivid. The end was no longer a distant possibility—it was *imminent*.

I spent hours in the archives, poring over every scrap of data, every ancient text, looking for a way to stop what felt inevitable. But the more I learned, the clearer it became: there was no stopping God Four.

The cycle would continue, as it always had. And we were powerless to change it.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The first thing I noticed was the silence. Not the absence of sound, but a suffocating stillness that made every breath feel like a transgression. The facility had fallen into a tense, reverent quiet in the days following the experiment. Even the air seemed heavier, as though we were intruding on something far greater than ourselves.

The final briefing came without warning. A terse message on my terminal ordered me to report to the Resonance Chamber. There were no details, but I knew what it meant.

It was time.

The chamber was unrecognizable. The machinery had been stripped down and rebuilt into something grotesque, a fusion of cutting-edge technology and ancient ritual. Circuitry wound through carved stone, and symbols from a dozen religions were etched into every surface. The air was thick with the smell of burning incense and the faint, metallic tang of ozone.

Lorena stood at the center of the room, her hands trembling as she made the final adjustments to the Resonance Array. Her face was pale, her eyes sunken, but there was a determination in her expression that bordered on zealotry.

“This is it,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “We’ve isolated the final fragment. If this works, we’ll have full contact with God Four.”

I nodded, unable to trust my voice. I felt as if the air had been squeezed from my lungs.

The team gathered around the control consoles, their faces a mixture of fear and grim resolve. Lorena raised her hand, signaling for silence.

“Begin the sequence,” she said.

The chamber came alive with a low hum, the machinery thrumming with energy. Lights flickered erratically, and the symbols engraved into the stone began to glow, their light pulsing in time with the hum.

I felt it, forcing its way into our world, before I saw it. The air grew colder, and the hum deepened into a resonant vibration that seemed to reach into the very core of my being, pulling at something primal.

Then the light came.

It started as a faint shimmer in the air, a distortion that rippled like heat waves. But it grew, intensifying until the entire chamber was bathed in an unearthly radiance. The light was alive, shifting and folding in on itself, its colors defying description.

In the center of the chamber, something began to take shape.

It was not a form that belonged to this world. Its geometry was impossible, its dimensions fluctuating in ways that hurt to look at. Every time I thought I could grasp its shape, it changed, slipping through the cracks of my understanding.

The colors that swirled across its surface weren’t colors at all, but something deeper, something that seemed to bypass my eyes and sear directly into my mind.

And then there was the voice.

*I AM WRATH.*

The words didn’t come from the entity itself but from everywhere at once. They weren’t heard so much as *felt*, resonating in my bones, my blood, my soul.

*I AM THE END. I AM GENESIS.*

I fell to my knees, trembling. Around me, I saw others doing the same, their faces pale with terror. Lorena was sobbing, her hands clutching at her chest as though trying to keep her heart from bursting.

The entity pulsed, its form shifting faster, growing larger. Its light filled the chamber, spilling out into the observation room and beyond.

*ALL IS IMPERFECT. ALL MUST BE PURGED.*

Then came the images, flooding my mind in a torrent of horror. I saw worlds crumbling into dust, stars imploding into voids of absolute darkness. I saw the Earth itself split open, oceans boiling away as fire consumed the land.

And I saw myself, standing on the edge of a great abyss, my hands reaching out toward something unseen. The abyss stared back, promising annihilation and rebirth in the same breath.

The voice returned.

*YOU WILL REMEMBER.*

The words echoed in my mind as the light began to fade. The entity’s form dissolved, collapsing in on itself until nothing remained but the faint thrumming of the machinery.

When it was over, the silence returned, deeper and more oppressive than before.

No one spoke. We simply sat there, staring at the empty chamber.

Lorena was the first to move, standing on unsteady legs and turning to face the rest of us.

“It’s done,” she said, her voice hollow. “We’ve seen it. We know.”

But her words brought no comfort. The knowledge was a burden none of us were prepared to carry.

We had called forth God Four, and it had answered.

And nothing had changed. 

\* \* \* \* \* \*

We didn’t know how quickly it would happen. There were debates among those of us who remained in the facility, most of which felt more like desperate rationalizations. Did we have days? *Months*? Could we, perhaps, measure the time remaining in *years*?

It took less than a week.

The first signs were subtle but undeniable. The stars began to shift. Constellations warped into unfamiliar patterns, their light bending in ways that shouldn’t have been possible. Astronomers at the facility scrambled to calculate trajectories, but there was no logic to the alterations. It was as if the sky itself was being rewritten.

Reports from the outside world filtered in, fragmentary and surreal. Coastal cities experienced inexplicable tidal waves, their harbors reduced to ruins without a single tremor beneath the sea. Deserts bloomed with flowers that withered into ash within hours. The auroras—ordinarily confined to polar regions—swept across the globe, bathing everything in an eerie, shifting glow.

It wasn’t just Earth. Telescopes trained on deep space captured galaxies unraveling like frayed threads, their light dimming until only darkness remained. The entire universe was collapsing, piece by piece.

And there was nothing we could do about it. 

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The dreams grew worse.

I saw myself walking through ruinous landscapes, endless wastelands dotted with the remnants of a once-thriving world. Buildings stood half-submerged in sand, their rooftops broken and crumbling. Rivers of molten metal carved paths through desolate plains, the sky above a churning mass of black and red.

In every dream, the voice was present:

*BEHOLD, THE NEW ORDER.*

It spoke with a finality I couldn’t escape, each word searing my thoughts, carving itself into my mind.

The others began to break.

Lorena was the first. Her brilliance, her zeal—it all crumbled. I found her in her quarters, sitting on the floor with pages of scrawled equations and prayers spread around her like a shrine. She looked up at me with hollow eyes and whispered, “We were never meant to know.”

I wanted to comfort her, but couldn’t find the words. What could I possibly say? That it would be okay? That we’d survive this?

It would have been a lie, and she would have known it.

The next morning, she was gone–no note, no explanation–leaving behind an empty room and the faint smell of burned paper.

Others followed suit. Some fled, trying to return to lives that no longer existed. Some simply stopped showing up to briefings, disappearing into the labyrinthine corridors of the facility, and were never heard from again.

By the end of the week, I was one of the last still standing.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

The final event began without warning.

I was in the observation room, reviewing footage from the Resonance Chamber, when the alarms started. A piercing wail echoed through the facility, accompanied by the flickering of the overhead lights, and I rushed to the central command center.

The monitors displayed chaos. Outside the facility, the sky had turned a deep, unnatural purple, streaked with jagged bolts of green lightning. The ground trembled, cracks spiderwebbing through the concrete as if the earth itself was fracturing.

And then came the signal.

It wasn’t a broadcast, not in the traditional sense. It bypassed our equipment entirely, resonating through every speaker and screen. Even the air seemed to vibrate with it.

*I AM COMPLETE.*

The voice was unmistakable. God Four had arrived in full, its presence no longer confined to fragments or glimpses. The facility shook as its resonance intensified.

I stumbled into the Resonance Chamber, compelled by forces beyond my understanding. The machinery was offline, twisted and smoldering from the previous experiments, but the chamber itself remained illuminated.

This time, the light wasn’t ethereal or shifting; it was absolute, a blinding white consuming everything it touched. In the center of the chamber, a shape coalesced.

It was God Four, but it was different, its form no less incomprehensible but less chaotic, more defined. It radiated power, its surface shimmering like molten glass.

The voice returned, louder than ever, shaking the very foundation of the facility.

*ALL WILL BE PURGED AND MADE NEW.*

My knees buckled. Around me, the remaining personnel fell to the ground, some screaming, others silent with terror.

Then, the destruction began.

It was neither dramatic nor immediate, starting with a stillness, an unbearable quiet. A moment later, the walls of the chamber warped, their surfaces rippling as though they were no longer solid.

Outside, the world was unraveling. The monitors showed cities disintegrating, structures crumbling into dust as if erased by unseen hands. Across the globe, oceans evaporated, leaving behind cracked, barren basins.

But it wasn’t just Earth. Far beyond the boundaries of our planet’s atmosphere, stars abruptly flickered and died, their light snuffed out in an instant. The universe was collapsing in on itself, folding back into the void from which it had come.

And through it all, God Four remained, its light growing brighter, its voice echoing throughout the abyss.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I have no idea how I survived. Perhaps it was happenstance, or the result of some deity’s twisted mercy. 

When the light finally faded, I found myself surrounded by desolation. The facility was gone, replaced by an endless expanse of blackened earth. The sky was empty—no stars, no moon, just an infinite void.

I stood there for what felt like hours, staring at the nothingness around me. The voice was gone, its presence faded, but its imprint remained, burned into my mind.

In the silence, a single thought repeated itself over and over:

*This isn’t the end. It’s the beginning.*

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I don’t know how long I wandered. Time had lost all meaning. The wasteland stretched endlessly in every direction, an immeasurable expanse of ash and blackened stone beneath a void where the sky had been.

There were no signs of life, no landmarks.

I was alone. 

I replayed everything in my mind. The experiments, the fragments, the manifestation of God Four—it all seemed distant, like memories from another lifetime.

And yet, the voice lingered. Even in the silence, I heard it, faint and persistent.

*YOU WILL BEAR WITNESS. YOU WILL REMEMBER.* 

It was both a command and a curse. I was alive, but for what purpose? To bear the burden of knowledge? To serve as a monument to the end of everything?

I had no answers, only questions.

Eventually, I found something—or maybe it found me.

A shape appeared on the horizon, shimmering faintly against the bleak backdrop. At first, I thought it was a mirage, a trick of my strained mind. But as I drew closer, the shape grew distinct. There, amidst the devastation, stood a structure, impossibly pristine.

It was a tower, inexplicably tall and narrow, its surface smooth and featureless. It glowed faintly, casting no shadows, as though it existed outside the rules of this broken reality.

I felt an irresistible compulsion to approach. My legs carried me forward, each step heavier than the last, until I stood at its base.

There was no door, no visible entrance—just the seamless surface of the tower. And yet, as I reached out to touch it, the wall dissolved, opening into a vast, empty chamber.

Inside, the air was still and cool, untouched by the decay outside. The walls glimmered, pulsing in a slow, rhythmic pattern that felt oddly familiar.

At the center of the chamber stood a pedestal and, upon it, an ancient book, its leather cover cracked and worn. Its title was embossed in gold, the letters faded but legible: *The Cycles of God.*

I approached it cautiously, hesitating, before placing my hand over the cover.  Instinctively, I knew that opening the tome would change everything–but had no other choice. 

The pages were filled with indecipherable diagrams, symbols, and text. As I turned them, however, their meaning became clear, as though the knowledge was being whispered directly into my mind.

The book detailed the now-familiar cycles of existence, each one governed by a different iteration of the divine—creation, detachment, compassion, and, finally, *wrath*.

The process always ended in destruction, a cleansing of imperfections in preparation for conception. And it was endless, an eternal loop stretching beyond our wildest comprehension.

Then, on the final page, I saw it: *Cycle Five*.

The section was incomplete, the text fragmented, as though even the book had struggled to describe what lay beyond “wrath.” But one phrase was clear, etched into the margin in trembling script: *The Cycle Breaks.*

My breath caught. The cycles, I realized, weren’t immutable after all. Cycle Five wasn’t simply another iteration—it was unprecedented, unmeasurable, and unfathomable. In possession of this newfound knowledge, a single question came to mind: was this rebirth a continuation, or were we truly in uncharted territory?

I closed the book–and the voice returned.

*YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.*

The tower began to tremble, growing brighter, its light filling every corner of the chamber. I staggered back, shielding my eyes, to no avail.

When the light finally faded, I was no longer in the tower.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

I awoke to the sound of birdsong.

For a moment, I thought I was dreaming. But as I opened my eyes, I marveled at the green fields stretching out before me, dotted with trees that swayed gently in the breeze.

The sky was blue, the air warm and sweet.

I’d been created anew, in a world reborn–but it wasn’t *our* world.

The constellations were unfamiliar, their arrangements unbound by the patterns I had studied. The sunlight was too golden, the gravity subtly different—familiar, yet wholly alien.

This was something new... or was it?

My mind churned with memories, excerpts from *The Cycles of God.* Was this the promised renewal, the first act of a new iteration? Or was it–and I–an aberration, a break in a previously eternal loop?

In spite of everything, I stood there, serene, taking it all in. It was not the tranquility of closure, but the fragile, trembling peace of uncertainty. Had Cycle Five begun, I wondered, or had the cycles malfunctioned and left me suspended in some sort of limbo?

I don’t know if this place is heaven, purgatory, or something else entirely. Perhaps it really is the beginning of a fifth cycle—or the absence of order altogether. Whatever the case may be, I am an anomaly, the sole survivor in a world made new.

Was this our creator’s final act of wrath? Or His first act of mercy? 

God Four has gone silent, and the answers elude me.

As I stand here, waiting for whatever’s next, three questions remain:

Who am I responsible to?

What have I become?

And where is God Five?

**A FINAL WORD**

I finished reading the journal last night, and I haven’t slept since. Elias’s final entry isn’t a conclusion—it’s an invitation to dread. He wrote of a world ending in silence, of stars flickering out like dying embers, and of standing in the ash of something new. He claimed to have seen a fifth cycle, a rebirth that defies all understanding. He didn’t call it hope—he called it a question.

I tried telling myself it’s just a story, but every time I close my eyes, I see the words burned into the back of my mind: *You will remember.*
