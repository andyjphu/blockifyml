WE NEED USDC,algorand,1i9ujgy,2025-01-25 14:15:46,11,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1i9ujgy/we_need_usdc/,Due-Albatross-2253,ASA ,"Or any other Stable. So as we can all see the node rewards are 99 percent incentive.  If we want this network to be self-sustaining we to need to push these numbers. Our TPS sits in the 30s/40s sometimes spiking into the 100s. These are rookie numbers. The fees are so low on ALGO that we need to be reaching well into the thousands if we want this to start moving to a self-sustaining model. 

Large projects like Fifa, Travel X and whatever Italy has going on will generate plenty of transaction but not enough at least not enough for now. That brings me to us the retail sector/DEFI here on Algorand. We need to start doing our part to improve transactions and like a good little capitalist make money while doing it. 

Liquidity pools. For those of you not familiar these are pools set up with a smart contract that allow for the swapping of two assets for example the ALGO/USDC pool on Tinyman allows you to swap your ALGO for USDC and your USDC for ALGO. These is a small fee associated with this swap that goes to the LP providers and the DEX. Also when these swaps are going on the generate transactions on chain collecting the fee that ALGO will eventually become dependent on. 

There are two types of pools Tandem and Stable paired pools. (I call them tandem I don't know an actual name yet.) Tandem pools are two varying assets such as ALGO/TINY or ALGO/CHIPS, These pools help you avoid Impermanent loss while still collecting some fees along the way. Impermanent lose (IL) is an effect of price fluctuations. When two assets diverge greatly from there starting values some assets will be lost in the rebalancing of the pools. This is particularly noticeable with the stable paired pools like ALGO/USDC. 

Tandem pools have the advantage that the price of the two assets are tied very closely together so when one moves the other moves with it. For example the ALGO/CHIPS pool has over 1million in TVL but generates almost no fees. $24 for the day as I currently see it on Tinyman. Having that much TVL and so little trade volume goes to show that there are almost no arbitrage traders working this pool because the prices don't diverge that often.  $8k worth of transaction in the last 24hrs. Which is great if you are just going to keep piling into this pool and you expect the assets to generally climb in value together. Not so great for the network as a whole. 

If you look at the CHIPS/USDC pool we can see a stark difference in volume. This pool has $1,400 worth of TVL. and has a done a whopping $24 in total transactions for the last 24hrs. that comes out to around 1.7 % of the volume being traded. With the tandem pool it comes out to 0.615%. That is more than double the amount of transaction per the TVL comparatively. This is not an isolated case it can be seen on almost every pool that has a stable pair vs a tandem pair. 

These stable paired pools generate double if not more transactions for the network and for the DEX they are on vs the tandem pools. These stable paired pools are horribly underfunded compared to their tandem counterparts. I understand that it is the Fear of IL that most likely keeps people from providing LP to the stable paired pools, but this needs to come to an end. 

Based on these observations It is safe to say that everyone should budget a small amount of their DCA into some of these Sable paired pools. 

Pros: 

1. You will generate a Yield from the fees/reward incentives

2. These will directly influence the amount of transaction on Algorand

  
Cons:

1. IL

With a steady trickle of more liquidity to these pools Algorand will have an increase in TVL, Transactions, and security of the network. If you want to actively Support Algo and make some scratch its a no brainer. Adding to these stable paired pools will have a trickle up effect for all assets that get the benefits of this added liquidity."

Valar say the following on their website to the question, ""Are there smart contracts involved when using Valar?

Yes, there are. These smart contracts are used just for processing the payment for the staking service of the node runner. **Your ALGO always stays in your wallet and are not exposed to any smart contract risks.**

Someone in our community responded the following

The smart contract is code they write to bring all this together .. for your wallet to pair up with current nodes in the valar network to stake together and then distribute the rewards back to originator wallets ..

If this code is compromised or hackers figure out loopholes or even if more nefarious with the developers playing games to hack their own users .. your wallet can get drained

This is what I was under the impression of

Even folks , tinyman, etc all have these Risks — Pera official site even have disclaimers about this and take no responsibility for you interacting with these 3rd party entities and their smart contracts

any interaction with contracts are at risk

I do know about the risk with folks, Tinyman, etc, but thought and read that Valar is safer as your algo never leaves your wallet. Can anybody else give me some feedback? You there Ghost??

The fun of the “double dip”? The excitement of checking if you won the weekly prize? 

Sadly, Yieldly slow rugged us all. But, there’s no reason we can’t bring some of that excitement back. This time, instead of it being a bunch of VC-backed turds who are going to dump tokens on your head, it’s a group of well-known Algorand OG’s who have been fighting for Algorand and just looking to make a fun product. 

**Introducing: Tardly Finance**

https://preview.redd.it/q2egg7pwmuee1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eafffbcae2a91a736a7311afab76a2b1698d1e01

* ***Wait, is this real?*** 

\- Yes. 

* ***How did Tardly come about?*** 

\- Tardly is part of an ongoing “community takeover” (i.e. where the community steps in to make a project successful after a creator rugs). Some may remember that in mid December a guy named Scott Summers came over to Algorand from the $ICP community. He was hilariously bizarre, and launched a coin called Algotardio ($ATARD) and some Milady derivative NFTs. It was an instant success and helped really kickstart activity on RugNinja and memecoin trading on Algo. 

But, Scott’s past quickly surfaced. Apparently he had a history of rugging the $ICP community, and at one point he even faked his own death. As quickly as he came to Algo, he rugged and figuratively died for a second time. 

While this was somewhat expected, a group of Algorand OG’s thought this whole bizarre thing was too good to let die, and that Algofam didn’t deserve to suffer another rug. So, we stepped in to make this thing awesome. 

Collectively, the group set up new socials, paid to take over the DEXscreener listing, set up a website, bought and burned \~9% of supply, airdropped the token to over 3000 addresses, bought and donated an additional 6.6% of supply to a multisig project wallet for future use, and set about finding ways to make something cool and lasting. 

* ***How does the NLL work*** 

\- Users of Tardly deposit ALGO into a pool. That pool stakes the ALGO in consensus to earn rewards over the span of an epoch. At the end of an epoch, a winner is chosen by VRF using the Algorand randomness beacon. That winner then wins the entire pot of rewards (less a cut that goes to project treasury, as described below). 

* ***Does it cost to enter?*** 

\- Other than normal transaction fees, no. Users can withdraw funds at any time and receive back what they deposited.

* ***Is there a minimum deposit?*** 

\- Yes. There is a minimum deposit of 100 Algo for entry. This is necessary because the associated contract has a limit of 12,288 accounts that can enter the NLL.

* ***How often is the drawing?*** 

\- Epochs last for approximately 48 hrs. After every 48hrs, the VRF selects a winner and a new epoch automatically starts. 

* ***What if I add to or remove stake during an epoch?*** 

\- To be eligible to win, a user’s stake must have been in the NLL for the full epoch. Changing a commitment will reset your entry time. Thus, if you commit, add, or remove stake in the middle of an epoch, you won’t be eligible for the prize in that epoch. Instead eligibility will resume during the following epoch. 

* ***How is a winner determined?*** 

\- The winner is chosen, based on weighted stake, via a verifiably random function using Algorand’s randomness beacon. In other words, odds increase the more you stake, but the selection is done in an entirely trustless and randomized way. 

* ***What are the payouts?*** 

\- The smart contract is programmed to pay out 70% of the epoch’s rewards to the winner of that epoch’s drawing. The other 30% is sent to the project’s multisig treasury account (tardio.algo) to be used as described below. 

* ***What is the treasury allocation used for?*** 

\- The treasury funds will be used for a combination of project costs (node cost, website hosting/development, etc.) and for buyback/burns of the $ATARD token. The plan is that of the treasury allocation, half will be reserved for costs and the other half will be for token buyback/burns.

* ***Why was this payout structure chosen?*** 

\- The goal is to find an optimal payout that rewards users, makes the project sustainable, and drives value back to the Algotardio token holders. If after launch its success shows that we can drive more value back to the winners and holders while keeping it sustainable, then we will.

* ***Do I need to hold your stupid shitcoin to participate in the NLL?*** 

\- No. 

* ***Who is behind this project?*** 

\- Being a “community takeover,” it is a loose assembly of OGs including myself, Fisherman (from NFD), Krby (Akita CTO specialist), Charles (from Allo), AlgoKnitter, Rydo, Yeyo, JHoleCreates, and others. Everyone pitches in where they can. 

* ***Who controls the project treasury?*** 

***-*** The treasury account (tardio.algo) is a 2/3 multi-sig with keys held by myself, Fisherman, and Krby. 

* ***Are the smart contracts audited?*** 

\- No. The contracts were written by Patrick from TxnLab (the person who wrote the Reti contracts) with some additional work by Krby. But, audits are expensive, and as a community driven effort we cannot front the thousands of dollars it would take to do an audit at this time. 

* ***Are the contracts open source?*** 

\- The Tardly NLL consists of two contracts. The first is the Reti Contract (which handles where ALGO is deposited, rewards accumulate, and are swept into the Tardly Reward Contract). This contract is already open source. The second contract is the Tardly Reward Contract (which handles entries, exits, winner selection, and payouts). This contract will be open sourced at the time of launch.

* ***tHaTs a TeRRibLe nAmE fOr a pRoJeCt! HoW wiLL yOu aTTrAcT sEriOus iNvEsToRs?*** 

\- Lighten up. Let’s be honest, NLLs aren’t being marketed to JP Morgan and BlackRock. It’s meant to be a fun NLL that hearkens back to Algorand’s first DeFi product while subtly trolling them. Play or don’t play. Win or don’t win. The choice is yours. 

* ***Wen launch?*** 

\- Imminent. Contracts have been done for a bit, the UI is finished, but we are still polishing/testing it now (as I type).

Solana validator & Algorand node on same rig,algorand,1i883k9,2025-01-23 12:01:48,3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1i883k9/solana_validator_algorand_node_on_same_rig/,BigHomieCed_,General,"Hello Algorand family.  
I am running an Algorand incentivized node through FUNC.   
Last night, on my same rig, I spun up a Solana validator - ALGO node was still green afterwards  
This a.m., before I checked my ALGO node/FUNC but after I checked Nodely for telemetry I staked a small amount of ALGO through my PERA wallet.

A few minutes later, I checked FUNC and it said something to the effect of, ""not eligible for incentives"".

Solana validator is still doing it thing.  


Tshoot 1 - I stop Solana Validator, participation key is still amber/ineligible for incentives  
Tshoot 2 - I unstake small ALGO coins in PERA wallet, participation key is still amber/ineligible for incentives  
Tshoot 3 - I stop/start Algorand node, participation key is still amber/ineligible for incentives  
Tshoot 4 - I rekey participation key, Node is participating in rewards again ...!  
\*Should have done Tshoot 4 before 3, wasn't thinking  
  
Question 1. Are participation keys updated dynamically both ways ...? As in, once its green and running and goes amber to ineligible, can it go back to green and receiving rewards if I figure what the problem is...? Or, once a participation key is marked invalid for incentives, do I have to rekey it ...?  
  
Question 2 - Could staking a small amount in the same PERA wallet have caused the ALGO node to become ineligible for rewards ...? Even with the wallet still having 30k+ ALGO coins available to it ...?

Question 3 - For those familiar with Solana, could my Solana validator have disrupted the Algorand node ...?

Question 4 - Could it have been something entirely different altogether, do this just happen from time to time and the node needs to be monitored more closely ...?  
  
I am currently trying to re-create the anomaly by deploying 2 more rigs, spinning up an Algorand node and Solana validator on each, and staking with different PERA wallets

Thank you for any insight."

Asking Grok why Algorand is lagging.,AlgorandOfficial,1i7upps,2025-01-22 22:52:10,0,0.41,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/1i7upps/asking_grok_why_algorand_is_lagging/,VinnyDeta,News/Media,"I asked grok the following question: Why is Algorand so much better than other blockchains in terms of tps speed, instant finality, transaction fee cost, reliability with no down time, security, and decentralization but it is not receiving as much investment as blockchains like solana and XRP? 

The response: 
Algorand's competitive advantages in various aspects of blockchain technology stem from its unique design and consensus mechanism:

- **Transactions Per Second (TPS)**: Algorand leverages a Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which allows for high throughput with claims of handling over 10,000 TPS under certain conditions. This is facilitated by its ability to process transactions in parallel without the need for traditional mining, making it efficient compared to other blockchains.[](https://originstamp.com/blog/solana-vs-algorand-which-one-is-better/)[](https://x.com/chriskim_dev/status/1865220654997614999)

- **Instant Finality**: Algorand achieves instant finality through its consensus protocol, ensuring transactions are confirmed in approximately 2.8 seconds with no chance of reversal, which is a significant advantage for applications requiring quick transaction confirmations.[](https://originstamp.com/blog/solana-vs-algorand-which-one-is-better/)[](https://x.com/EldarDRM/status/1864350469327606176)

- **Transaction Fee Cost**: The transaction fees on Algorand are very low, with a minimum fee of 0.001 ALGO, which translates to a fraction of a cent in USD. This flat fee structure does not increase with network congestion, making it cost-effective.[](https://www.algorand.foundation/news/jump-into-web3-with-algorand)

- **Reliability and No Downtime**: Algorand has maintained an impressive record of uptime, with no significant downtime since its launch. This reliability is due to its consensus mechanism, which is designed to prevent forks and ensure network stability.[](https://www.algodaddy.org/2023/02/why-algorand-is-better-than-solana.html?m=1)[](https://x.com/AlgoFamily/status/1627862949963366400)

- **Security**: Algorand's PPoS system is designed to be resistant to various attacks, including the 51% attack, due to its random selection of validators, which ensures a more democratic and secure validation process. It also includes post-quantum security measures.[](https://atomicwallet.io/academy/articles/what-is-algorand-cryptocurrency)[](https://x.com/chriskim_dev/status/1865220654997614999)

- **Decentralization**: Despite the high efficiency, Algorand maintains a level of decentralization with thousands of nodes participating in consensus, although it's worth noting that the degree of decentralization can be a point of debate as it depends on node distribution and control.[](https://x.com/KayBlockchain/status/1861178808004681947)

However, several factors might explain why Algorand does not attract as much investment as other blockchains like Solana or XRP:

- **Marketing and Ecosystem**: Solana and XRP have benefited from more aggressive marketing strategies and have established larger or more high-profile ecosystems. Solana, in particular, has seen significant investment due to its high-profile DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and partnerships. XRP has historical ties to Ripple, which provides it with institutional backing and use cases in international payments.

- **Community and Developer Adoption**: The size, activity, and enthusiasm of the developer and user community can significantly influence investment. Solana, for instance, has cultivated a vibrant developer community with numerous projects, which can drive investment.

- **Market Perception and Momentum**: Market trends, hype, and momentum play a huge role in investment decisions. Solana has often been at the forefront of discussions around high-performance blockchains, perhaps overshadowing Algorand in the public eye.

- **Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and Early Adoption**: The way tokens are distributed initially can affect long-term investment. XRP had a significant early distribution to financial institutions, giving it a head start in terms of adoption and investment interest.

- **Partnerships and Use Cases**: While Algorand has notable partnerships, the visibility and impact of these might not match the scale or the marketing push behind similar partnerships of competitors like Solana or XRP.

- **Speculative Investment**: Investment in cryptocurrencies can be heavily influenced by speculative trends, where investors might chase after blockchains that are perceived to have more ""buzz"" or potential for short-term gains, regardless of technical merits.

In essence, while Algorand holds significant technical advantages, the broader market dynamics, including investor psychology, marketing effectiveness, and ecosystem development, also dictate investment flows. It's crucial for Algorand to continue enhancing its ecosystem, increasing visibility, and perhaps revisiting its marketing strategy to better capitalize on its technological strengths."

This is one of the biggest updates in Algorand history. The network will now reward participants who propose blocks! Algorand is unique because of the following:

* **No slashing risk**
   * Staked Algo is not subject to slashing. Instead, ineffective nodes are algorithmically removed from consensus and simply forgo rewards.
* **No lockup period**
   * On Algorand, independent validators maintain control of their Algo at all times. Staked tokens remain in a user’s wallet while securing the network as part of consensus.
* **Low cost**
   * Running a node on Algorand is extremely cheap. All you need is a computer with 16GB of RAM, fast SSD, and 1 Gbps internet connection.
* **Real-time rewards**
   * The initial rewards for block proposers are 10 Algo + 50% of txn fees per block. On Algorand, rewards are paid out as each block is finalized, every 2.8 seconds, and your stake automatically compounds, instantly increasing your voting power.

**Why is this huge?**

This will make Algorand one of the most **egalitarian**, **democratic**, and **decentralized** blockchains in the world. You don't need a data center or crazy hardware to run a node. Anyone can run one on a mediocre laptop or minipc! Algorand to me lives up to the ideals of Satoshi, anyone, anywhere can help secure the chain and liberate themselves from the shackles of traditional finance. This brings us one step closer to the dream of a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Now, lets get into the weeds!

Recommended system specification for **participation** nodes is:

* 8 vCPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
* 1 Gbps connection with low latency

Personally I run my own on a Beelink Minipc and it runs flawlessly (https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs). Please note, this is above the required specs and you can find cheaper ones that will run flawlessly.

There will be many options for node running depending on whether you have access to the required hardware and ALGO requirements.

1. **Solo staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * By running an Algorand node you become an active contributor to this decentralized system. Your node, acting as an independent validator, helps prevent fraudulent activity and ensures only valid transactions are added to the blockchain. Node runners contribute to ensuring the robustness of Algorand infrastructure which benefits developers, applications, and users across the ecosystem.Participating nodes also have voting rights on network proposals, allowing you to have a direct say in Algorand’s future development.
2. **Liquid staking (any Algo amount)**
   * Liquid staking applications allow users to stake their Algo while maintaining liquidity. While each platform is unique, the typical process asks users to deposit Algo and mint new tokens that represent the ownership and value of the staked Algo and can be used across the [DeFi ecosystem](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/defi). 
3. **Staking pools (any Algo amount)**
   * Staking pools enable groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to stake their Algo to a validator and get rewarded based on the rewards the validator receives. Unique staking options are also available, such as staking via DEX liquidity pools (which requires committing Algo plus another asset). 
4. **Delegated staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * Delegated staking involves utilizing a third-party to run a node on the your behalf while your Algo remains your wallet at all times. This provides an option for users who want to help secure the network and collect rewards, but don’t have the knowledge or resources to run their own node.

If you choose to run your own node, there are many different options for getting your node up and running. From command line interface purism to one-click solutions. Currently, I use FUNC, which is a one click option for Windows that is extremely simple and easy.

* https://algorand.co/run-a-node
   * Nodekit (https://nodekit.run/)
   * FUNC (https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func)
   * A1C (https://github.com/AustP/austs-one-click-node/releases)
   * Manuel Installation (https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)

The minimum amount needed to run your own node and get rewards is 30,000 ALGO. Keep in mind, you can still run your own node with a lower amount, **as little as .1 ALGO**, you just will not get rewarded.

If you don't have the required 30,000 ALGO you can put your ALGO in a liquid staking pool and get rewards. There will be many different platforms to do so. Below is a non-exhaustive list.

* Pera Algo Wallet (https://perawallet.app/?download=true)
* Folks Finance (https://app.folks.finance/liquid-staking)
* Tinyman (https://app.tinyman.org/liquid-stake)
* Pact (https://www.pact.fi/)
* CompX (https://app.compx.io/staking-pools)
* Messina One (https://messina.one/liquid-staking)
* Valar (https://stake.valar.solutions/)



You will also have the ability to setup your OWN pools and let people stake to your pools via Reti Pooling. The Réti Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized staking pools on the Algorand network, enabling groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to trustlessly stake to a Validator and earn yield based on the rewards the Validator receives.

* [https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme](https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme)
* [https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti](https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti)



I also assume the major exchanges will allow you to earn a percentage back on any ALGO you keep on an exchange.

Help be a part of decentralizing Algorand and get paid in the process!

**Exciting times are ahead! I hope you're Reti!**

$Ballsack on Algo - The FARTCOIN of Algorand.  Ballsack to Ballhalla!  $1M MCap and growing!!,CryptoMoonShots,1i6v8k3,2025-01-21 17:26:07,24,0.96,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1i6v8k3/ballsack_on_algo_the_fartcoin_of_algorand/,Haunting_Ad_9486,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"# BALLSACK.  TO BALLHALLA.

Some guy from Kroger decided to spin up a memecoin on Algorand.  **$BALLSACK.**  That's the name.  There's no white paper.  If you're expecting white paper, you're going to be disappointed.  Just smell them hairy balls instead to decide if you wanna buy.

* Boomer 52 yr old based Dev minted on [Rug.Ninja](http://Rug.Ninja) and owned zero.  Sad balls.  The community/investors sent him some donated BALLSACK to retire from Kroger eventually.  Bonded on January 3, 2025.
* 2,515 hairy $BALLSACK holders. Shows people really care about their balls.  Become one, and hold your balls.  That's a growth of 800+ people per week holding onto their GIGANTIC BALLSACKS.
* Have you seen the GIGANTIC ballsack puppet?  Good lord.  ( NSFW: [https://www.ballsackalgo.com](https://www.ballsackalgo.com) )
* Currently ranging around $1m Market Cap.  Previously eclipsed 2M BALLS MCAP.  Gotta spread the ballsy smells.
* Large, cult community driving this meme to new heights all the time.
* What more can you ask for?  **$BALLSACK TO BALLHALLA.**
* Algorand's $Monko meme is entering multiple CEXes soon, with BitMart launching tomorrow.  Many other memes are to follow suit, exploding Algo onto the scene... so this is your early entry and warning.  Your **BALLSACK** warned you.

Staking the Future: Coinbase's Regulatory Dance and Strategic Pivot  
  
Navigating Regulatory Waters: The Impact of Recent Challenges on Coinbase's Staking Service  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the recent regulatory and operational hurdles faced by Coinbase's Staking Service, examining the implications on its business model and user trust. With states like California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin challenging Coinbase's staking services under securities laws, and the SEC issuing a Wells Notice, we explore how these regulatory actions have led to temporary service limitations and potential long-term strategic shifts. The suspension of Algorand (ALGO) staking rewards and delays in Solana (SOL) transactions highlight operational challenges, sparking concerns over customer consent in staking practices. Financially, the analysis assesses the market reaction, including a market cap loss, and potential growth areas like staking in ETFs. We also look at Coinbase's commitment to compliance and innovation in staking technology as a pathway to navigate through these challenges. This abstract sets the stage for a comprehensive examination of how Coinbase can adapt its staking service amidst regulatory scrutiny to maintain its position in the crypto ecosystem.

Algorand is clearly made in USA, this is what ChatGPT says:

>Is Algorand made in America?

>Yes, Algorand was created in America. It was founded by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and Turing Award-winning computer scientist, who is based in the United States. Algorand Inc., the company behind the blockchain, is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.

Something is very wrong. CMC is for sure funded by private interest afraid of high quality projects.

But we have seen similar lowball kicks from CMC, for example for failing to include ALGO or HBAR in the Crypto Awards 2024, but included a ton of shitcoins (https://coinmarketcap.com/events/cmc-crypto-awards-2024/)"

Weekly Copyright Reminder,AlgoNFTMarketplace,1i5d26i,2025-01-19 19:01:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoNFTMarketplace/comments/1i5d26i/weekly_copyright_reminder/,AutoModerator,MOD UPDATE/NOTIFICATION,"This is a weekly reminder post of this sub's stance on potential copyright infringement.  This is a serious issue that needs to be kept in mind when creating and listing NFTs. 

Original post by u/HurleyBird1

Quick disclaimer: I AM NOT A LAWYER. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE - THIS IS SIMPLY INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO EDUCATE YOURSELVES AND PREPARE YOURSELF FOR LEGAL ADVICE FROM A LICENSED SOURCE.

Now that that's out of the way. My credentials are: MBA, with a bit of business law classes under my belt.

I want to give a quick explanation of how copyright works - and I'll do so through quick blurbs n some myth/reality bullets.

Source: [copyright.gov](https://copyright.gov) (US)

102. Subject matter of copyright: In general28(a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include the following categories:(1) literary works;(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;(7) sound recordings; and(8) architectural works.(b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.

\- Myth: I can use any image/song/video/writing I want.

\- Reality: No. Not true at all.

\- Myth: Well they never said it's copyrighted.

\- Reality: Upon publication (and even while a work in progress) a work is automatically protected via copyright under US Law.

\- Myth: Well they never sold it.

\- Reality: It doesn't have to be commercialized to be protected.

\- Myth: Well it was a long time ago

\- Reality: Possibly true...as long as the creator is deceased (or if multiple creators, the last living one is deceased) and the required time has passed...although this gets tricky with ""estates.""

(d) Duration of Rights.—(1) With respect to works of visual art created on or after the effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, the rights conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of the author.

So what's this thing I hear called ""Fair Use?""

Straight from the source:

107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use41Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

Uhh...help me translate that please... (here's a decent official translation: [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html))

1. above...if it's non-profit educational use, you're usually good to go...if it's for money or trade (commercial nature) then you're usually NOT...unless YOUR piece is ""transformative""

Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.

\- Myth: Well this is paid for in Algos, not USD so it's not ""commercial""

\- Reality: IT IS commercial. You could even barter for bacon and it'd be commercial. It's an exchange of one good/service for another good/service.

\- Myth: My piece with Batman inside a card is ""transformative""

\- Reality: No, unfortunately, more-than-likely the courts would say it's not. A good litmus test is...""If Warner Bros Entertainment (owner of Batman) wanted to make an NFT/ASA ""Batman card"" would yours compete with it or be possibly mistaken (by a reasonable person - so in America think 8th grade education) for real merchandise? Probably...thus it's not transformative enough.

""nature"" gets a little tougher. This looks at protecting the ""creative process."" Thus, using other works of art is less-likely to be protected than using factual sources - like historical photographs since it's easier to ""create art"" and thus ""transform"" factual pieces than other art pieces. This is also talking to things like ""parody."" Satire is NOT protected. ""Parody"" is. What's the difference? LegalZoomputs it well: While a parody targets and mimics the original work to make a point, a satire uses the original work to criticize something else entirely. Another way to look at it is that satire uses another work as a way to comment on something happening in the world that has nothing to do with the original work.

\- Myth: I added a different border, extra planets, and some blur effect to MTZ's World of Light - it's a new piece of art.

\- Reality: Not likely the courts will see it that way.

\- Myth: This guy added a filter, some burn effects, and collaged a bunch of newspaper headlines together - isn't that a violation!

\- Reality: Probably not...the courts would probably see this as a creation of art out of factual sources.

amount/substantiality in relation to the whole...this is where using clips of songs that are only like 5 seconds long works! But using more than that...runs into problems. This is tough to decipher too...as some songs are EASILY identifiable from just 5 seconds (Ice, ice, baby) - and thus NOT fair use. But some aren't. Usually you're safe using a very small clip of a song or video - especially if you're adding more to it. But this is a dangerous game to play - and there's places to get free audio (some sources below)

effect of the use - this is probably the biggest one. Courts will look at simply...does YOUR work affect the sales or potential for sales of the copyright owner. Of note...this is looked at at the time of the issue being brought to the court, not at the time of sale. For example, let's say my batman card sells for 10 Algos today, but Algorand BLOWS UP and soon every NFT is on Algorand. And now my OG Batman NFT is seen as one of the first Batman ones and official. Warner Bros gonna sue the shit outta whoever owns it at the time they sue to get the rights to all sales of that NFT. So that person is left holding an empty bag when Warner Bros wins in court.

\- Myth: Well they're not commercializing it NOW so I'm safe.

\- Reality: Technically, yea Warner Bros probably won't spend the money to go after the OG artist and the hands the asset passed through...HOWEVER, they may. That's their right. Who knows - the Napster days showed us the lengths companies will go to. EVEN BIGGER HOWEVER, the last person holding it when Warner Bros DOES decide to go after that Batman NFT...uh oh for them - they just lost their asset.

\- Myth: Well it's been like a year, and no one has brought up copyright. So I'm good.

\- Reality: If this was in a normal market...maybe this argument would work. If McDonald's let you sell a Ronald McDonald poster for like a year on Amazon with no issues, some court may say ""bro, you took too long to bring this to us."" HOWEVER, with cryptocurrency being so new (and Algorand being so little known/discussed), most courts would see it as ""reasonable"" that a copyright owner failed to exercise their rights within a year - possibly even a decade. (Updated because I realized last example dealt with trademark not copyright :o)

So what am I safe to use?

US Government works (mostly)...any deemed free to use by creator...and any a copyright lawyer says they have your backs on (cuz now they're liable).

Here's some great sources for free use items (please add to this list below if you know of some!!!):

Pictures: [https://buffer.com/library/free-images/](https://buffer.com/library/free-images/) (Unsplash is one of my faves)

Music: [https://www.wix.com/blog/photography/2019/11/27/free-music-for-videos/](https://www.wix.com/blog/photography/2019/11/27/free-music-for-videos/)

Video: [https://blog.hootsuite.com/free-stock-videos-sites/](https://blog.hootsuite.com/free-stock-videos-sites/)

You'll notice there's a lot of ""shoulds"" ""coulds"" ""probably"" etc. This is because copyright cases are all unique and go to the courts. The best bet is to go with stuff you KNOW is free and fair-use. If not, I'd look up copyright law, consult supreme court cases concerning copyright, and ultimately, talk to a lawyer.

AGAIN: I AM NOT A LAWYER. I AM NOT PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE. I AM SIMPLY PROVIDING INFORMATION. THERE MAY BE ERRORS ABOVE THAT COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES - CONSULT A COPYRIGHT ATTORNEY IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE LEGAL ADVICE."

call me jealous or impatient, i dont really care, im just sick of seeing degeneracy in the market, crypto with no use case, just digital coins backed by nothing. people making millions all the power 2 them, but how they are making the money is essentially gambling

also sick of blockchains that are inferior being talked about like its the best thing since the creation of the internet. 

im tempted to advocate pure degeneracy in this community to hype this blockchain up like there is no tomorrow, its time the price of algo reflects the tech, bring the hype. my bags are packed, lets get algo to the moon"

CoinBase Mistake tripped my stop-loss order. I need opinions.,CryptoHelp,1i4qaya,2025-01-18 23:29:54,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoHelp/comments/1i4qaya/coinbase_mistake_tripped_my_stoploss_order_i_need/,mediocremycology,❓Need Advice 🙏,"Between 3:25 GMT and 3:27 GMT, the CoinBase exchange for Algorand-USD made 3, 1-minute wicks down from \~ 0.4374 to .4274 and immediately returned to about the same price where it started these 3 candles. This tripped my stop-loss that was set for .4290 and I sold a bunch of ALGO at .4285, which was not ideal given the price immediately returned to where it started. I was kind of annoyed at this and confused why it happened as no other coins on CoinBase show a similar pattern (which is atypical because this big of a wick down would indicate a larger market sell-off). I then looked at the ALGO-USD market on multiple other exchanges, none of which showed the same 1-minute wicks in that timeframe as CoinBase for ALGO. The price on every exchange except CoinBase didn't wick down to those levels. I am frustrated because I got kicked out of the market, seemingly erroneously. It feels like this was sort of a mistake on CoinBase, but I don't really understand how it even happened. Thoughts on how this happened and if there's anything I can do about it? Should I bring this to Coinbase? It seems wrong that CoinBase could just move the price around like that which would trigger a bunch of buy and sell orders... 

I have some screenshots of this event, let me know if it would be helpful to post those. "

She isn’t going to make a coinbase account and jump through those hoops. There is no way say she’s taking pictures of her license and connecting a bank account at this first touch point with crypto. The credit card purchase option in Pera says not for the US. Any advice???

Uninterrupted Power Supply for your node ,algorand,1i3pby6,2025-01-17 15:03:26,32,1.0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1i3pby6/uninterrupted_power_supply_for_your_node/,AlgoCleanup,General,"Thrilled to see so many new nodes coming online in preparation for staking rewards. With all the buzz I’ve seen a lot of discussion around mini PCs. If you are planning on running a node it would be a good idea to look into UPS (uninterrupted power supply) units when getting setup. 

It’s a good idea to have some fail safe to keep your internet and node online in case of a power outage. 

Many users will connect their node to their router via Ethernet so all equipment may be in the same area. UPS would be a good product to add to your shopping list when getting setup. 

Fail safe to ensure you continue to receive rewards and don’t have to pay the 2 Algo fee if your node is evicted from consensus. 

“However, if you are evicted from consensus by the protocol for non-participation, your incentive eligibility will be reset, and you will need to submit a key registration transaction again, with the 2 ALGO fee, to become eligible for rewards again.”

Algorand… it is time. $BALLSACK is taking over the community. Can it be our $FARTCOIN and onboard the masses?,algorand,1i3gps4,2025-01-17 08:48:11,6,0.53,50,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3gps4,mellamobenito,ASA ,"Look. I get it. 

In a world where the tech wins maybe we didn’t need $BALLSACK. 

But it’s happening. $MONKO is leading the way and $BALLSACK is right behind. Ying and yang. Be. 

What happens if all of the $ALGO community embraces our memecoins?

We’ve already seen playful engagement with the $BALLSACK community from the Algorand Foundation. 

Serious and respected voice like Eldar have even bought in. 

$BALLSACK has onboarded new $ALGO holders from $ETH $SOL $ADA $HBAR and $XRP. 

Maybe it’s time to embrace the opportunity. Ballhalla awaits. "

Why do we have to use FUNC or AUST?  Seems like these are developers outside that are making these softwares?

  
I am just worried to run software like this because of the MyAlgo hack and if there ends up being backends or weaknesses to the codes/contracts/etc which ends up leading to getting drained

  
The official Algorand setup for their nodes involve LINUX/MacOS which has all these DOS like commands and stuff which is not easy for non-technical people to do properly

As awareness grows, so does the trend towards eco-friendly cryptocurrencies and sustainable mining practices. Imagine a world where your investments not only grow your wealth but also contribute to a healthier planet. That's the promise of green crypto projects. By investing in these eco-conscious initiatives, you're not just making a smart financial move—you're also taking a stand for sustainability. It's a win-win for your portfolio and the planet!  

Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2025:  

Cardano (ADA): Known for its energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano is a leader in sustainable blockchain technology.  
Algorand (ALGO): Algorand is committed to being carbon-negative, offsetting its small carbon footprint through partnerships with environmental organizations.  
Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): This network uses a unique consensus algorithm that is highly energy-efficient, making it one of the greenest options out there.  
Chia (XCH): Chia uses a proof-of-space-and-time consensus mechanism, which is significantly less energy-intensive than traditional mining.  
Stellar (XLM): Stellar's consensus protocol is designed to be energy-efficient, making it a sustainable choice for eco-conscious investors.



Why don't cryptocurrency investors ever get lost?  
Because they always follow the blockchain!

The answer can be quite simple. mALGO.

mALGO by MessinaOne was launched in September 2023 as alternative to Folks Finance's gALGO.  
Contrary to gALGO, mALGO can be unstaked at all times (always liquid), has fees AFTER the period (not on your stake) on rewards only (so no slashing), and does not require unwrapping and then restaking of your holdings. Although I think maybe Folks have addressed that by now. 

mALGO is a pure liquid staking and interest bearing asset that accumulates your rewards in the value of mALGO itself. With every passing rewards period, the price of mALGO vs ALGO is updated and 1 mALGO becomes a little more valuable. Meaning if you would unwrap your mALGO holdings, you receive more ALGO back than you originally staked.

Another fun fact is that mALGO is the only continuing liquid staking token carrying over seamlessly from Governance into Consensus when validator rewards go live. Your mALGO holdings will be committed to nodes run by MessinaOne after Governance has ended.

"Algorai, providing additional utility for xUSD!",CompX,1i0hik9,2025-01-13 11:14:15,5,0.78,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompX/comments/1i0hik9/algorai_providing_additional_utility_for_xusd/,CompX-Initiative,,"Hi All,

*TL:DR - Algorai, a defi project running options vaults has added a GOLD$ bull vault that's funded with xUSD. Check them out and see if this vault, or any of their other ones, fit within your defi strategy. Also don't forget that we are incentivizing the* [PACT xUSD/USDC ](https://app.pact.fi/pool/1013729631?chart=Volume&period=D)*stable pool with xUSD interest revenue, so if you have stables sitting around, put them to work for you.*

We just want to shine a spotlight today on a project that is supporting xUSD by utilizing it in their platform. Algorai Finance is a [project ](http://docs.algorai.finance)that has brought option vaults to Algorand.  Users place tokens in a vault that will use a specific trading strategy over week long cycles.  These trading strategies are classified as a bull or bear strategy. There are several blue chip assets that have their own bull/bear strategies, such as Algo, goBTC and GOLD$ and more.

From a user perspective, you can decide if you think the price of the asset will increase or decrease over the next week. If you are betting that an asset will increase in value, you would add stablecoins to the bull vault for that asset, and if you think the asset will lose value you would place tokens from that asset in the bear vault.  Users should be aware of the strike price for their asset. For example, this week in the GOLD$ vault, a strike price of $81.4 has been chosen by the bull vault. As long as the asset ends on a price that's above $81.4, the vault will yield a net gain for the user. If the price falls below the strike price, there will be a net loss of tokens for the user due to the poor price action.

The decision which vault to add to is not a zero sum game. Strike prices are chosen so that both bull/bear vaults can succeed with each round. For example, GOLD$, bear and bull vaults have success rates over 90%. These success rates are clearly displayed for each vault in the Algorai UI.

Algorai vaults run for a week at a time. You can place tokens into the contract at any time, but they won't be used until the next round begins. After that, the tokens will be used to execute the desired trading strategy. Tokens can be called back at any time, though the user will have to wait until the end of the current round to actually access their principle + any potential gains. From one cycle to the next, any tokens in the contract will automatically be included in the next cycle, unless they've been called back by the user. This effectively compounds gains from week to week. Algorai takes fees from the gains that are made during any given cycle, meaning that if a loss is realized in some individual cycle, it doesn't take any fees.

At CompX we're celebrating the fact that xUSD has been selected as the stablecoin for the GOLD$ bull vault. This means that users can deposit xUSD into the contract and potentially access gains that Algorai creates by enacting the bull trading strategy. The vault has been active for 13 rounds, with 12 of them finishing in profit. Based on current performance, the vault is projecting a 9.45% APY yield, which is sustainable because it's not built on rewards payouts but on real on-chain trading profits. Use of xUSD increases demand, trading volume and brings additional utility to the token and we're very happy they've selected it. Currently the GOLD$ bull vault currently has over 55 thousand xUSD tokens deposited, generating profit. We hope you guys will take a second to check out Algorai. Check out the GOLD$ vault along with their other vaults to see if what they're offering fits into your long term defi strategy. We want innovative projects to be successful on Algorand, and supporting them and generating revenue happens when you use their vaults to make money for yourself. If their project is in your preferred risk profile, check them out!

Increased use of xUSD is great, but we're still going to rely on our community to participate in the project by providing liquidity. In the age of swap routers, all liquidity is good liquidity and we're grateful for EVERYONE that provides xUSD liquidity on the dexes. That being said, we are currently pushing liquidity depth in our [PACT stable pool ](https://app.pact.fi/pool/1013729631?chart=Volume&period=D)by continuing to divert a portion of our xUSD revenue to build liquidity in that pool, which is the core of our liquidity in transaction volume and support to the rest of the ecosystem. All users have to do is place liquidity in that pool, and stake those LP tokens at CompX to get their cut of that xUSD interest. Currently, the calculated APY for the stablecoin LP staking is around 12%. Help us build a native, decentralized stable that by Algorand, for Algorand.

Thanks for the read, and stay safe out there."

This is a serious issue that needs to be kept in mind when creating and listing NFTs. 

Original post by u/HurleyBird1

Quick disclaimer: I AM NOT A LAWYER. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE - THIS IS SIMPLY INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO EDUCATE YOURSELVES AND PREPARE YOURSELF FOR LEGAL ADVICE FROM A LICENSED SOURCE.

Now that that's out of the way. My credentials are: MBA, with a bit of business law classes under my belt.

I want to give a quick explanation of how copyright works - and I'll do so through quick blurbs n some myth/reality bullets.

Source: [copyright.gov](https://copyright.gov) (US)

102. Subject matter of copyright: In general28(a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include the following categories:(1) literary works;(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;(7) sound recordings; and(8) architectural works.(b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.

\- Myth: I can use any image/song/video/writing I want.

\- Reality: No. Not true at all.

\- Myth: Well they never said it's copyrighted.

\- Reality: Upon publication (and even while a work in progress) a work is automatically protected via copyright under US Law.

\- Myth: Well they never sold it.

\- Reality: It doesn't have to be commercialized to be protected.

\- Myth: Well it was a long time ago

\- Reality: Possibly true...as long as the creator is deceased (or if multiple creators, the last living one is deceased) and the required time has passed...although this gets tricky with ""estates.""

(d) Duration of Rights.—(1) With respect to works of visual art created on or after the effective date set forth in section 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, the rights conferred by subsection (a) shall endure for a term consisting of the life of the author.

So what's this thing I hear called ""Fair Use?""

Straight from the source:

107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use41Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

Uhh...help me translate that please... (here's a decent official translation: [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html))

1. above...if it's non-profit educational use, you're usually good to go...if it's for money or trade (commercial nature) then you're usually NOT...unless YOUR piece is ""transformative""

Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.

\- Myth: Well this is paid for in Algos, not USD so it's not ""commercial""

\- Reality: IT IS commercial. You could even barter for bacon and it'd be commercial. It's an exchange of one good/service for another good/service.

\- Myth: My piece with Batman inside a card is ""transformative""

\- Reality: No, unfortunately, more-than-likely the courts would say it's not. A good litmus test is...""If Warner Bros Entertainment (owner of Batman) wanted to make an NFT/ASA ""Batman card"" would yours compete with it or be possibly mistaken (by a reasonable person - so in America think 8th grade education) for real merchandise? Probably...thus it's not transformative enough.

""nature"" gets a little tougher. This looks at protecting the ""creative process."" Thus, using other works of art is less-likely to be protected than using factual sources - like historical photographs since it's easier to ""create art"" and thus ""transform"" factual pieces than other art pieces. This is also talking to things like ""parody."" Satire is NOT protected. ""Parody"" is. What's the difference? LegalZoomputs it well: While a parody targets and mimics the original work to make a point, a satire uses the original work to criticize something else entirely. Another way to look at it is that satire uses another work as a way to comment on something happening in the world that has nothing to do with the original work.

\- Myth: I added a different border, extra planets, and some blur effect to MTZ's World of Light - it's a new piece of art.

\- Reality: Not likely the courts will see it that way.

\- Myth: This guy added a filter, some burn effects, and collaged a bunch of newspaper headlines together - isn't that a violation!

\- Reality: Probably not...the courts would probably see this as a creation of art out of factual sources.

amount/substantiality in relation to the whole...this is where using clips of songs that are only like 5 seconds long works! But using more than that...runs into problems. This is tough to decipher too...as some songs are EASILY identifiable from just 5 seconds (Ice, ice, baby) - and thus NOT fair use. But some aren't. Usually you're safe using a very small clip of a song or video - especially if you're adding more to it. But this is a dangerous game to play - and there's places to get free audio (some sources below)

effect of the use - this is probably the biggest one. Courts will look at simply...does YOUR work affect the sales or potential for sales of the copyright owner. Of note...this is looked at at the time of the issue being brought to the court, not at the time of sale. For example, let's say my batman card sells for 10 Algos today, but Algorand BLOWS UP and soon every NFT is on Algorand. And now my OG Batman NFT is seen as one of the first Batman ones and official. Warner Bros gonna sue the shit outta whoever owns it at the time they sue to get the rights to all sales of that NFT. So that person is left holding an empty bag when Warner Bros wins in court.

\- Myth: Well they're not commercializing it NOW so I'm safe.

\- Reality: Technically, yea Warner Bros probably won't spend the money to go after the OG artist and the hands the asset passed through...HOWEVER, they may. That's their right. Who knows - the Napster days showed us the lengths companies will go to. EVEN BIGGER HOWEVER, the last person holding it when Warner Bros DOES decide to go after that Batman NFT...uh oh for them - they just lost their asset.

\- Myth: Well it's been like a year, and no one has brought up copyright. So I'm good.

\- Reality: If this was in a normal market...maybe this argument would work. If McDonald's let you sell a Ronald McDonald poster for like a year on Amazon with no issues, some court may say ""bro, you took too long to bring this to us."" HOWEVER, with cryptocurrency being so new (and Algorand being so little known/discussed), most courts would see it as ""reasonable"" that a copyright owner failed to exercise their rights within a year - possibly even a decade. (Updated because I realized last example dealt with trademark not copyright :o)

So what am I safe to use?

US Government works (mostly)...any deemed free to use by creator...and any a copyright lawyer says they have your backs on (cuz now they're liable).

Here's some great sources for free use items (please add to this list below if you know of some!!!):

Pictures: [https://buffer.com/library/free-images/](https://buffer.com/library/free-images/) (Unsplash is one of my faves)

Music: [https://www.wix.com/blog/photography/2019/11/27/free-music-for-videos/](https://www.wix.com/blog/photography/2019/11/27/free-music-for-videos/)

Video: [https://blog.hootsuite.com/free-stock-videos-sites/](https://blog.hootsuite.com/free-stock-videos-sites/)

You'll notice there's a lot of ""shoulds"" ""coulds"" ""probably"" etc. This is because copyright cases are all unique and go to the courts. The best bet is to go with stuff you KNOW is free and fair-use. If not, I'd look up copyright law, consult supreme court cases concerning copyright, and ultimately, talk to a lawyer.

AGAIN: I AM NOT A LAWYER. I AM NOT PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE. I AM SIMPLY PROVIDING INFORMATION. THERE MAY BE ERRORS ABOVE THAT COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES - CONSULT A COPYRIGHT ATTORNEY IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE LEGAL ADVICE."

However, I notice that a lot of the Algo posts are from people that left Cardano to come over here….

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1hv931s/start_using_the_cardano_ecosystem/) the other day in the Cardano forum and realized that there really isn’t much to offer on that blockchain based on the responses I got. In my post, I was filled with optimism and encouragement but the sentiment in that thread really opened my eyes. 

The Cardano blockchain just really isn’t usable in its current state, 8 years into its inception. On the other hand, I have found much more promise in the Algorand ecosystem using the wallet, Pero. I can also clearly see how great the RWA space is going to be over there just by using things like Lofty and Vesta with fractional ownership in real estate. This is a clear improvement over Cardano where they don’t even have a good stable coin.

So in summary, my question is for all those who have abandoned Cardano….why have you decided to leave Cardano completely to come to Algorand, outside of the reasons I stated in my post? "
How is Algorand solving the relay node centralization issue?,algorand,1hxl4ag,2025-01-09 14:35:31,42,0.98,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1hxl4ag/how_is_algorand_solving_the_relay_node/,Alex31337,ASA ,"Context: I was reading this article about Algorand: [https://algonaut.space/algorand-nodes/](https://algonaut.space/algorand-nodes/)

Inside, it refers to this Tweet (https://x.com/Justin\_Bons/status/1860372891092623632). In his Tweet, Justin says: ""I usually exclude ALGO from such lists due to the issue with its centralized relay nodes, but considering they are very close to fixing that issue, I thought I could make an exception here"". 

Anyone knows what he means by ""but considering they are very close to fixing that issue""? In general, how is Algorand working to fix the relay node centralization issue?"
"Update on the Undrawn Lotto: Here’s What Happened and What’s Next
",algorandcasino,1hxf1hv,2025-01-09 10:18:28,28,0.98,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorandcasino/comments/1hxf1hv/update_on_the_undrawn_lotto_heres_what_happened/,Responsible_Cat_2349,,"Hey everyone,

We wanted to address what happened with the Chip Lotto on Tuesday, 7th January, and share how we’re improving things moving forward.

For context, the Chip Lotto is part of Algorand Casino and is built on the Algorand blockchain (labs.algo-casino/lottery). The issue occurred because the automated call to the smart contract responsible for triggering the draw failed. Smart contracts on most blockchains, including Algorand, cannot execute themselves—they require an external trigger. In this case, our automated bot encountered an issue due to a problem with our cloud provider.

To prevent this from happening again, we’re introducing a new feature:

	•	After the draw time has passed, a “Draw” button will appear on the Lotto interface for a certain period.

	•	If a participant in that specific Lotto clicks this button before the automated bot does, they’ll receive 100 Chips as a reward. This small incentive ensures that the draw will always happen, even if automation fails.

As a gesture of goodwill, we’ve also bumped up Friday’s pot by 1,000,000 Chips, bringing it to over 2.3 million Chips! 🎉

If you were part of Tuesday’s failed draw and haven’t claimed your refund yet, here’s what you need to do:

	1.	Visit the Chip Lotto page.

	2.	Click on the “Refund” button to claim your Chips back.

There are still 3 users who haven’t claimed their refunds yet—please make sure to do so! There’s no deadline for claiming refunds, but we encourage you to act soon to avoid any confusion.

Thanks for your understanding and continued support. We’re committed to making Chip Lotto better and more reliable for everyone.

Good luck in Friday’s draw!
