My first attempt at an ECS... your thoughts please?,gameenginedevs,1i9k8jm,2025-01-25 05:31:36,17,0.81,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameenginedevs/comments/1i9k8jm/my_first_attempt_at_an_ecs_your_thoughts_please/,TheOrdersMaster,,"So, a couple of days ago I asked how you all handle Entities / Scene Graphs and the overwhelming majority was using ECS. So naturally, having little to no experience in C++ memory management, apart from half a semesters worth of lectures years ago (which I spent doing work for other courses), I decided I wanted an ECS too, and I wanted the flying unicorn type of ECS if I'm going through the trouble of rebuilding half my engine (to be fair there wasn't much more than a scenegraph and a hardcoded simple render pipeline).

In any case I read the blogs of some very smart and generous people:

* [Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/)
* [Niko Savas](https://medium.com/@savas/nomad-game-engine-part-2-ecs-9132829188e5)
* [David Colson](https://www.david-colson.com/2020/02/09/making-a-simple-ecs.html)
* [Stefan Reinalter (Molecular)](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/2013/10/22/implementing-a-semi-automatic-structure-of-arrays-data-container/)

And then I force fed ChatGPT with my ridicoulous requirements until it spat out enough broken code for me to clobber together some form of solution. To whit: I think I've arrived at a rather elegant solution? At least my very inexperienced ego is telling me as much.

In Niko Savas Blog I found him talking about SoA and AoS type storage, and seeing that it would be completley overkill for my application, I **needed** to implement SoA. But I didn't want to declare the Components like it's SoA. And I didn't want to access it like it's SoA. And I didn't want to register any Components. And I didn't want to use type traits for my Components.

And so I arrived at my flying unicorn ECS.

(to those who are about to say: just use entt, well yes I could do that, but why use a superior product when I can make an inferior version in a couple of weeks.)

Now, since I need to keep my ego in check somehow I thought I'd present it on here and let you fine people tell me how stupid I really am.

I'm not going to post the whole code, I just want to sanity check my thought process, I'll figure out all the little bugs myself, how else am I going to stay awake until 4 am? (also, the code is in a very ugly and undocumented state, and I'm doing my very best to procrastinate on the documentation)

# First: Entities

`using EntityID = size_t;`

64-bit may be overkill, but if I didn't have megalomania I wouldn't be doing any of this.

The actual interaction of entities is done through an Entity class that stores a reference to the scene class (my Everything Manager, I didn't split entity and component managers up into individual classes, seemed unnecessarily cumbersome at the time, though the scene class is growing uncomfortably large)

# Components

    struct Transform{
      bool clean;
      glm::vec3 position;
      glm::quat rotation;
      glm::vec3 scale;
      glm::mat4 worldModelMatrix;
    };

Components are just aggregate structs. No type traits necessary. This makes them easy to define and maintain. The goal is to keep these as simple as possible and allow for quick iteration without having to correctly update dozens of defintions & declarations. This feature was one of the hardest to implement due to the sparse reflection capabilities of C++ (one of the many things I learned about on this journey).

# SoA Storage of Components

I handle the conversion to SoA type storage though my ComponentPool class that is structured something like so:

    template <typename T>
    using VectorOf = std::vector<T>;
    
    // Metafunction to transform a tuple of types into a tuple of vectors
    template <typename Tuple>
    struct TupleOfVectors;
    
    template <typename... Types>
    struct TupleOfVectors<std::tuple<Types...>> {
        using type = std::tuple<VectorOf<std::conditional_t<std::is_same_v<Types, bool>, uint8_t, Types>>...>; // taking care of vector<bool> being a PIA
    };
    
    template<typename cType>
    class ComponentPool : public IComponentPool {
    
        using MemberTypeTuple = decltype(boost::pfr::structure_to_tuple(std::declval<cType&>()));
        using VectorTuple = typename TupleOfVectors<MemberTypeTuple>::type;
        static constexpr size_t Indices = std::tuple_size<MemberTypeTuple>::value;
    
        VectorTuple componentData;
        std::vector<size_t> dense, sparse;
    
        // ... c'tors functions etc.
    };

 The VectorTuple is a datatype I generate using boost/pfr and some template metaprogramming to create a Tuple of vectors. Each memeber in the struct cType is given it's own vector in the Tuple. And this is where I'm very unsure of wether I'm stupid or not. I've not seen anyone use vectors for SoA. I see two possible reasons for that: 1. I'm very stupid and vectors are a horrible way of doing SoA 2. People don't like dealing with template metaprogramming (which I get, my head hurts). My thinking was why use arrays that have a static size when I can use vectors that get bigger by themselves. And they take care of memory management. But here I'd really appreciate some input for my sanities sake.

I also make use of sparse set logic to keep track of the Components. I stole the idea from David Colson. It's quite useful as it gives me an up to date list of all entities that have a component for free. I've also found that it makes sorting the vectors very simple since I can supply a new dense vector and quickly swap the positions of elements using std::swap (i think it works on everything except vector<bool>).

# Accessing Components

Finally, to access the data as if I was using AoS in an OOP style manner (e.g. `Transform.pos = thePos;` I use a handle class Component<cType> and a Proxy struct. The Proxy struct extends the cType and is declared inside the ComponentPool class. It has all it's copy/move etc. c'tors removed so it cannot persist past a single line of code. The Component<cType> overrides the -> operator to create and return an instance of a newly created proxy struct which is generated from the Tuple of Vectors. To bring the data back into the SoA storage I hijacked the destructor of the Proxy class to write the data back into the tuple of vectors.

    struct ComponentProxy : public cType {
            explicit ComponentProxy(ComponentPool<cType>& pool, EntityID entityId)
                : cType(pool.reconstructComponent(entityId)), pool(pool), entityId(entityId) {}
    
       ComponentPool<cType>& pool; // Reference to the parent Component class
       EntityID entityId;
    
       ~ComponentProxy() { pool.writeComponentToPool(*this, entityId); }
       ComponentProxy* operator->() { return this; }
    
       // ... delete all the copy/move etc. ctors
    }

This let's me access the type like so: 

    Entity myentity = scene.addEntity();
    myentity.get<Transform>()->position.x = 3.1415;

It does mean that when I change only the position of the Transform, the entire struct is getting reconstructed from the tuple of vectors and then written back, even though most of it hasn't changed. That being said, the performance critical stuff is meant to work via Systems and directly iterate over the vectors. Those systems will be kept close to the declaration of the components they concern, making maintaining them that much simpler.

Still I'm concerned about how this could impact things like multi-threading or networking if I ever get that far.

# Conclusion

If you've come this far, thank you for reading all that. I'm really not sure about any of this. So any criticism you may have is welcome. As I said I'm mostly curious about your thoughts on storing everything in vectors and on my method of providing AoS style access through the proxy.

So yeah, cheers and happy coding."

Mod blocking the vanilla Furnace recipe. I can't find out which one though.,feedthebeast,1i8133v,2025-01-23 06:14:36,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1i8133v/mod_blocking_the_vanilla_furnace_recipe_i_cant/,Sea-Translator-7739,Problem,"I'm playing Big Chad Guys Cobblemon modpack (1.20.1, Fabric) currently and added mods to make my experience better/easier (very casual player) but somewhere when i added mods, one of them disabled the vanilla crafting recipe and now I can't find out which one it was. Does anyone know which one it could be? (warning for a very long list. Some mods not included in the list are Peaceful Mobs, Cobblefoods, Lootbeams fabric updated, Tree Harvester + Ore Harvester, Multibeds, Cushy Pillows, Particle Rain, Skay's overworld netherite ore, some Farmer's Delight addons (Rustic, Honey + more), Litematica. A few others I may have missed but I'll try to get the names later as it's 5am and I haven't slept well since 4pm rip. 

  
I deleted Mighty Mail since it just never let the game load if I had it for some reason.

Here is the full power of the senju's,NarutoFanfiction,1i7sax9,2025-01-22 20:48:30,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/1i7sax9/here_is_the_full_power_of_the_senjus/,Flat_Fun_2334,Self Promotion,"# Senju's

Senju clan physiology 

Electro-Reflexive Speed: Senju clan members possess reflexes that are truly extraordinary, enabling them to perceive and react to attacks almost instantaneously. This enhancement is so advanced that it allows them to dodge not just conventional strikes but even beams of light, which most shinobi would find impossible to evade. The term ""lightning"" in the name is somewhat misleading as it implies only an ability to dodge lightning; however, Senju reflexes are so refined that they can treat light rays as slow-moving objects. This makes them virtually untouchable in combat situations, as their reactions are several magnitudes faster than what most opponents can handle.

Titan’s Strength: The physical power of a Senju is immense, reaching levels far beyond the norm. By the age of puberty (around 14 years old), their strength becomes colossal, enabling them to perform feats such as uprooting trees and lifting boulders off the ground, and with with their bare hands. This strength is not just limited to their ability to lift or smash objects but extends to their capacity to cause widespread destruction and overwhelm even the most formidable defenses with raw power. Their muscles and physical form are adapted to handle extreme stresses and exertions with ease. 

Titanic Resilience: Senju clan members are renowned for their incredible durability. Their bodies can endure severe physical trauma that would incapacitate or kill most shinobi. This resilience is apparent from a young age, and by the time they reach adolescence, their bodies are capable of withstanding extreme punishment, similar to how Uzumaki members endure injuries. Unlike the Uzumaki, who possess steel skin, Senju durability relies on their inherent toughness, making them difficult to incapacitate through physical damage alone. They can survive blows that would typically be fatal, and only exceptionally severe trauma to critical areas like the brain or heart can be fatal.

Boundless Endurance: The Senju have an almost boundless reservoir of stamina, allowing them to engage in extended combat and physical exertion without showing signs of fatigue. This endurance enables them to continue fighting even when severely wounded or after prolonged periods of exertion. Their stamina is such that they can keep pushing their limits far beyond what most shinobi could endure. This characteristic is exemplified by their ability to persist in battle despite suffering major injuries or severe chakra drain.

Blitz Step: : The Blitz Step is a high-speed movement technique that allows Senju to move so rapidly that their motions become nearly invisible. When executed by skilled users, it creates afterimages that can appear almost as solid as actual clones, and their speed can approach that of light. This technique enables Senju to perform rapid attacks and evasions that are imperceptible to the naked eye, making them exceptionally difficult to target or counter.

Accelerated Healing: Senju possess an innate regenerative ability that allows them to recover from severe injuries with remarkable speed. From childhood, they are capable of healing wounds and injuries rapidly, a trait that becomes even more pronounced as they mature. By the age of 16, their regeneration can extend to regrowing lost limbs and repairing internal damage, though it does not cover the brain or heart. Notably, they can even survive decapitation if the head is reattached within 60 seconds, although the process requires time and leaves a noticeable scar.

Hyper-Energy Burst: Senju can activate an adrenaline rush at will, significantly boosting their physical capabilities and rendering them impervious to pain for a short period. This surge of energy enhances their strength, speed, and resilience, allowing them to perform extraordinary feats of combat and endurance. It is a temporary but powerful enhancement that can turn the tide of battle in critical moments.

Chakra Overdrive:Senju clan members possess vast reserves of chakra that rival even the Bijuu. Their chakra is not only immense in volume but also incredibly dense, which enhances the potency and effectiveness of their jutsu. When they release a burst of chakra, it is described as a dense and heavy rain, reflecting their capacity for powerful and expansive chakra manipulation. This amplification boosts the power of their techniques to extraordinary levels.

Life Force Infusion: Unique among shinobi, Senju have a secondary reserve of chakra that is used to temporarily enhance their physical attributes and overall combat effectiveness. This reserve, though small compared to their primary chakra pool, can be directed to vital points in the body to boost performance and unblock chakra points if necessary.

Instant Mastery: The Senju have an exceptional ability to rapidly learn and perfect new techniques. This capacity for instant mastery allows them to acquire and refine skills and movements in a fraction of the usual time required. Their training efficiency is unparalleled, enabling them to achieve significant improvements and advancements in their abilities at a pace that exceeds that of other shinobi.

Adaptive Muscle Memory: Allows the user to quickly learn and adapt to new physical movements and techniques, mastering them in a fraction of the time it would normally take.

Heightened Awareness: Senju can heighten their sensory abilities to detect minute changes in their environment. This enhanced perception allows them to sense subtle movements and alterations in their surroundings, and they can even experience events in slow motion for brief periods. This heightened awareness gives them a tactical advantage in both combat and situational analysis.

Neural Acceleration: The Senju possess accelerated neural responses, which enable faster decision-making and reaction times. This enhancement works in conjunction with their slow-motion perception, allowing them to perform rapid movements with precision and clarity. Their cognitive processes are optimized for high-pressure situations, making their reactions incredibly swift and accurate.

Eternal Revival: In life-threatening situations, a Senju can expend a portion of their lifespan—up to six months—to rejuvenate and fully heal from injuries. This ability allows them to restore themselves to peak condition in critical moments. Given their naturally long lifespans, which often exceed a century, this sacrifice is manageable and can be a decisive factor in dire circumstances. The process rejuvenates their physical state but does not fully counteract the aging effects of their long lifespan.

Energy Sensory: Senju can sense energy and major events within their vicinity, though this ability is not as developed as the Mind's Eye of Kagura. They can detect significant changes in their environment and sense the presence and intent of others, allowing them to react to threats and opportunities with heightened awareness.

Power Bestowal: Senju can transfer their chakra to others, which can heal wounds and increase the recipient’s strength. This ability allows them to support allies by sharing their vast chakra reserves, enhancing their combat effectiveness and recovery.

Elemental Manipulation: Senju can manipulate the five basic elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning, and Wind) as well as Yin and Yang. This versatility enables them to perform a wide range of techniques and applications, making them highly adaptable in combat situations. Their elemental proficiency includes the ability to combine elements for advanced techniques.

Minor Self-Sustenance: Senju can survive without food or drink for several months and function without sleep for extended periods. This self-sustenance reduces their reliance on basic needs and allows them to maintain peak performance over prolonged periods.

Resistances: Senju have natural resistances to illusions, extreme temperatures, pain, and most poisons, though their resistance is not as extensive as the Uzumaki's. These resistances enhance their ability to endure diverse threats and environmental challenges.

Wood Release: The Senju are renowned for their ability to use Wood Release, which combines Earth and Water elements to create and manipulate wood and plant life. This unique ability allows them to control and utilize vegetation for both offensive and defensive purposes.

Another is grass release or turf style, which manipulates and controls the growth of grass, making blades of grass as tall and thick as trees. These blades of grass can then be telekinetically controlled to ensnare, trap and even kill targets. 

Techniques include 

Rapid Growth Manipulation: Users can accelerate the growth of grass within their vicinity, allowing them to create dense barriers, constructs, or even rapidly form protective cover during battle.

Grass Blades Technique: The ability to shape grass into sharp, durable blades for offense and defense. These blades can be used as weapons, projectiles, or to form intricate traps in the battlefield.

Photosynthetic Energy Absorption: Users can absorb sunlight and convert it into chakra, enhancing their own energy levels. This ability not only provides a natural and sustainable source of power but also allows for increased strength and stamina during the day.

Root Manipulation: the power to control and manipulate the roots of grass. This can be utilized for various purposes, including creating snares, entangling opponents, or even forming a network of underground communication.

Chlorokinesis: Users can manipulate the chlorophyll in grass, altering its color, transparency, or even inducing bioluminescence. This power can be used for stealth, signaling, or creating mesmerizing visual effects.

Rooted Defense Barrier: Users can create formidable defensive barriers by rapidly growing thick layers of intertwined grass roots. These barriers are both resilient and flexible, absorbing and dispersing the impact of incoming attacks.

Symbiotic Bonding: Users can establish a symbiotic connection with the grass, allowing for enhanced sensory perception within areas covered by grass. This connection also grants insight into the health and conditions of the surrounding plant life.

Pollination Distraction: Users can release pollen from the grass to create distracting clouds. This pollen can interfere with the sensory abilities of opponents, causing confusion or triggering allergic reactions.

Grassland Manipulation: The ability to shape and manipulate large areas of grassland. Users can transform the landscape, creating hills, valleys, or even concealing entire areas with a thick carpet of grass.

Vitality Infusion: Users can infuse their chakra into the grass, revitalizing and enhancing its natural properties. This power accelerates the growth of the grass, making it more robust and resilient in various applications.

Quake Style: Overview: Quake style enables the user to generate and control seismic energy, causing earthquakes, fissures, and vibrations. It is a devastating element that can reshape the terrain and overwhelm opponents with sheer destructive force. 

Techniques include 

Seismic Shockwave: Releases a powerful shockwave through the ground, causing an earthquake that disrupts the battlefield and knocks opponents off their feet.

Fissure Strike: Creates a fissure in the ground that travels toward the target, splitting the earth and causing severe damage. 

Tectonic Armor: Encases the user in a layer of hardened earth, enhancing their defense and resistance to physical attacks. 

Earthquake Stomp: Stomps the ground to generate localized tremors that can destabilize opponents and structures. 

Vibration Pulse: Sends a pulse of vibrational energy through solid objects, causing them to shatter or collapse. 

Quake Hammer: Forms a massive hammer of seismic energy that can be used to deliver crushing blows. 

Aftershock: Creates delayed tremors in the ground that activate after a certain period, catching opponents off guard and causing further disruption.

Diamond Release (diamond Style)Diamond Release allows the user to generate, manipulate, and control diamond-like crystalline structures. This advanced Kekkei Tōta combines the precision and beauty of Crystal Style with the toughness and sharpness of Earth and Wind Release. Diamond Release excels in both offense and defense, creating nearly indestructible constructs and highly efficient cutting tools or traps.

Techniques:

Diamond Blade Creation: Forms sharp, gleaming blades of diamond that can cut through most substances with ease.

Diamond Armor: Encases the user in an unbreakable diamond suit, providing unmatched defense while amplifying physical power.

Diamond Barricade: Generates massive diamond walls to block attacks or divide the battlefield strategically.

Diamond Spear Rain: Launches a storm of razor-sharp diamond spears, targeting multiple enemies from a distance.

Diamond Regeneration: Repairs and reshapes damaged diamond constructs by channeling chakra into them.

Diamond Fortress: Constructs a massive, fortified diamond structure to protect allies or hold off overwhelming assaults.

Diamond Fist: Coats the user's fists in crystalline diamond, enhancing the impact and sharpness of physical strikes.

Diamond Net: Weaves a glistening diamond web to ensnare or slice through enemies.

Diamond Shatterstrike: Causes diamond constructs to explode into shrapnel, damaging all enemies in the vicinity.

Diamond Body: Temporarily transforms the user's skin into diamond, dramatically boosting durability and resistance to physical attacks.

Diamond Drill: Creates a spinning diamond drill capable of breaking through the toughest obstacles or defenses.

Diamond Chains: Summons unbreakable diamond chains to bind and immobilize opponents.

Diamond Reflection: Forms mirror-like diamond surfaces to deflect light-based or projectile attacks.

Diamond Dome: Envelops the user or allies in a protective, transparent diamond dome, shielding against both physical and chakra-based attacks.

Diamond Lance: Extends a long, piercing lance of diamond for precision strikes at a distance.

Prismatic Burst: Uses diamond surfaces to refract and scatter light into blinding, weaponized flashes of energy.

Diamond Trapfield: Creates a field of hidden diamond spikes and traps that activate when enemies step into them.

Diamond Rainstorm: Rains down thousands of razor-sharp diamond shards over a wide area.

Crystal Core Pillar: Generates a massive diamond pillar that erupts from beneath the ground to disrupt formations or launch enemies into the air.

Diamond Mastery: Full control over diamond constructs, enabling creation of intricate designs, overwhelming offenses, and nearly impenetrable defenses.

Clay Release (Clay Style)

Clay Release allows the user to mold and animate clay into various shapes and forms, which can be used for offense, defense, and utility. This release combines Earth Style with explosive chakra, enabling the creation of animated constructs that can detonate on command.

Techniques include:

Clay Golem: Creating large, powerful golems for combat.

Explosive Clay Birds: Forming birds that can fly and detonate upon impact.

Clay Armor: Encasing the user in a layer of hardened clay for defense.

Clay Clone: Creating clones that can explode when damaged.

Clay Shield: Raising a shield of hardened clay to block attacks.

Explosive Clay Mines: Planting mines of clay that detonate when stepped on.

Clay Tentacles: Extending tentacles of clay to ensnare or attack enemies.

Clay Bombs: Forming small bombs that can be thrown and detonated.

Clay Serpent: Creating a large serpent of clay that can constrict and explode.

Clay Wings: Forming wings of clay to enable flight.

Clay Spikes: Launching spikes of hardened clay at enemies.

Explosive Clay Web: Creating a web of clay that detonates upon contact.

Clay Pit: Forming a pit of quicksand-like clay to trap enemies.

Clay Fortress: Constructing a fortress of clay for protection.

Clay Cannon: Firing large projectiles of clay that explode on impact.

Elemental Fusion: The Senju can combine different elements to create advanced elemental techniques. While these fused techniques are potent, they are generally less powerful than those of true bloodlines. This ability allows for creative and versatile applications of their elemental manipulation skills.

Do remember that all of this is only possible through combat. In order to reap any benefits from your senju biology you must at least have combat training.

# Blurb/Synopsis

Captain Henry Donnager expected a quiet career babysitting a dusty relic in Area 51. But when a test unlocks a portal to a world of knights and magic, he's thrust into command of Alpha Team, an elite unit tasked with exploring this new realm.

They join the local Adventurers Guild, seeking to unravel the secrets of this fantastical realm and the ancient gateway's creators. As their quests reveal the potent forces of magic, they inadvertently entangle in the volatile politics between local rivalling factions.

With American technology and ancient secrets in the balance, Henry's team navigates alliances and hostilities, enlisting local legends and air support in their quest. In a land where dragons loom, they discover that modern warfare's might—Hellfire missiles included—holds its own brand of magic.

**Chapter 32: Die Harder**

\-- --

Henry watched Sera’s face scrunch beside him as the credits started to roll. She looked adorable with that Santa hat sitting just over her ears. It was the first movie he’d shown her, but Die Hard seemed to have thrown her for a loop in more ways than one.



“I’ve yet to see what particular qualities render this a… ‘Christmas’ movie. I’d have thought your ‘Christmas’ celebrated this ‘Christ’, through feasts, festivities, familial gathering?”



Henry leaned back. He *was* gonna offer an answer but Ron beat him to it, sprawled in his chair with that shit-eating grin of his. 



“Shootouts, explosions, and a badass saving the day. Perfect Christmas vibes.”



“So, your holidays oft involve guns and explosions? Truly, you are a most peculiar people.” The amusement in her voice made Henry grin.



“Hey, to be fair, Christmas *does* sometimes involve guns and explosions.” He reached over the left side of the couch, grabbing a gift-wrapped box. He brought it up and presented it to her. “Merry Christmas, Sera.”



“This paper is a marvel.” Sera laid her hand on it but hesitated, glancing at Henry. “Are you certain this was made to be torn? It seems a cruel end for such finery.”



The little culture shocks were indeed things to look forward to. Something about the way she treated the wrapping made him chuckle. “It’s supposed to look fancy so you’ll feel bad tearing it. But… that’s sorta half the fun. Plus, we’ve got a fuck ton of it sitting in storage, so it’s not like you’re committing a crime against art or anything like that.”



She still looked unsure, but started tearing at the tape anyway. Her uncertainty only compounded as she finally got the wrapping off the box and opened it to reveal a hard-sided case.



She lifted it up but paused right after. A smile grew on her face. That case, those latches, the weight of it – she knew exactly what this was. Almost like she was unveiling a crown jewel, she eased it open, dragging out the dramatic reveal. Lo and behold, it was a pistol, massive and ridiculous in all the right ways: a Desert Eagle.



Sera didn’t even need to say anything; Henry could see it in her face. She reached for it, allowing the weapon to catch the Christmas tree’s lights as she examined it like it was some legendary Baranthurian artifact. “So, this is your ‘serious punch’, is it?”



Henry grinned. He knew she’d like the gift. “Yup. The Hand Cannon.”



“Thought you might appreciate something with a bit more kick than the M18,” he continued. “I think you’ll be able to handle the recoil better than most people could even dream of. There’s holsters and other stuff in there too. Full kit. Couldn’t fit too much ammo though, but you can always grab some more down at the quartermaster’s. Stuff ‘em in your Holding Bag, maybe.”



She confirmed his decision making. “A finer gift I could scarce imagine. Truly, Henry, you spoil me. And yet, it’s almost as though you sought to match my gift for you.”



Sera reached into her Holding Bag. “I’m afraid I had not the foresight to wrap this – yet fear not, for where I lack paper and ribbon, I more than compensate with presentation. Merry Christmas, Henry.”



Out came a silver case, damn expensive by the look of it, covered in flowing curves that may have equally been decoration or runes – perhaps both. No other markings on the box, though; not even the usual ones he’d see with corporate products. Whatever this was, it was no Mithrilforged or Red Sail item. It was privately commissioned, like those suits billionaires wore – where real money skipped Gucci and Prada and went straight to master craftsmen. 



Henry opened the box. Inside lay an amulet, fancier than what he’d even imagined, yet with a simple elegance to it. The runes along the surface all connected to a blue mana crystal in the center – smooth and refined, like the Baranthurian ones he’d seen. Honestly, with how often they'd come across ancient artifacts in their missions, he wouldn’t be surprised if it actually *was* a Baranthurian crystal.

The Nobian amulets they'd recovered looked shoddy in comparison, but if those stored enough mana for consistent mid-tier casting, just how much mana did this thing store? Not that mana capacity mattered much to him. He couldn’t cast at all, so why this of all things as a gift?



Sera seemed to have picked up on the confusion in his face. “Oh, fret not, dear Captain. I’d not burden you with some trinket demanding magic. What use would that be to you? Nay, a mere tap will rouse it to life. Put it on.” She held the box out like it owed her an answer.



Henry picked it up and brought it around his neck. But he didn’t secure it just yet. “It isn’t gonna turn me into a frog, either. Is it?”



“Turn you into a *frog*? Why, the amulet is far too fine for such mischief.” Her vibrant fuschia eyes bore into his, damn near threatening to lock him in place. “Besides, it would be a shame to squander such looks on webbed feet and warts.”



She pulled back, grinning. “Though, if it does sprout you a pair of webbed feet, you’ve my word – I’ll keep you in a gilded pond fit for a prince.”



Well, that was convincing enough. Henry put on the amulet and let it hang. “What,” he grinned. “You’re not even gonna try to restore me?”



“Ha! I’ve heard tales that a kiss might break the curse, but I’ll not risk catching warts on your behalf.” She tapped the crystal.



A blue flash lit up the air around Henry as the barrier sprang to life – damn near invisible, but that slight distortion was recognizable. It was the same type of shield Kelmithus used to throw up when things got dicey, though that initial flash had been a deeper, more intense shade of blue.



Sera smirked. “See? Not a wart in sight!”



“Woah!” Ron called out from the side. “The hell’s that? A magic shield?”



Ryan whistled. “Seems to be comin’ from that there necklace. Any chance you got a spare?”



That was the most assured ‘no’ to a question he’d ever seen. The thing looked like it costed more than a house, probably only affordable by the highest tiers or by nobles with connections. “Uhh… we can try to see if we’ve got any down at the quartermaster’s?”



Ryan let out a long, defeated sigh. “Hell, couldn’t think of a more far-fetched dream.” He shook his head and started turning toward the kitchen area. “Gonna grab some choco, gimme a minute.”



As he left, Isaac called out to them. “Join up when y’all are done. We’re boutta do Secret Santa.”



“Yeah, we’ll be right there,” Henry responded. He turned to find Sera flicking the magic shield with her finger.



“Strike it soundly, and it shall glow the loveliest blue – a sign it holds fast. But should it pale to that wretched white? Why, you’d best hope you’ve a few spare mana crystals at hand.”



The barrier flickered with a faint azure tint where she’d flicked it – concerning, to say the least. Either that crystal was hella sensitive, or Sera packed more strength in those delicate fingers than he’d thought. He hardly had the time to even register that when Sera moved on.



“The barrier will hold steady, though it’ll sip at the amulet’s mana while it does. Or, should you wish to keep its strength for dire need, a single tap will rouse it when you choose.”



Tough decision, but it was better than no decision. They wouldn’t have Kelmithus with them on every mission, and Sera could only do so much by herself.



“Thank you.” Henry meant it. Not only was the gift pretty sweet, but it also had significant potential.



Their eyes met… again. This would probably be one of those times where an interruption was due, but none came. Instead, Sera brought them back to the alarm. “That mistletoe tradition… would you care to explain it at last?”



Henry had been all set to demonstrate back then. Now? Well, it didn’t quite feel the same, especially not with the whole crew sitting there. So much for all that resolve. It was probably better to gauge her reaction first anyway.



“It’s a Christmas tradition. Basically, if two people find themselves underneath it at the same time, they kiss.”



“Kiss? My, what an… *intimate* custom. And tell me, Henry – does tradition require us to abide, or is it but a suggestion?” The shift in Sera’s voice was killer. All those ridiculous mommy ASMR videos he used to make fun of? Henry finally understood now.



“Well, it isn’t an like… an *obligation*, per se.” Henry shrugged, trying to play nonchalant. “It’s more like an excuse for couples, or sometimes a way to give a little push.”



That smirk crept across her face like she’d just struck gold. “Oh, I should hate to dishonor your Christmas traditions. But perhaps it was for the best that we were interrupted. After all, some moments are better savored than rushed – certainly not squandered on excuses.”



Correction: they *both* struck gold. But Sera barely gave him any time to react. “Now, let us see to this ‘Secret Santa’ ritual, shall we?”



– –



Secret Santa and the subsequent feast on assorted monster meats – exempting goblin meat, of course – had been pretty fun. But once Christmas was over, they had to lock in. Now, having completed the Tier 7 exam, Henry almost wished he *hadn’t* locked in so hard. Between their consistent studying throughout their time at the Academy and the mere existence of that guidebook, the test had been extraordinarily easy.



It was different from their first exam – more conventionally difficult, certainly. But that was precisely what made it easier. Most of the test focused on the stuff that separated novices doing odd jobs from leaders undertaking massive quests. And most of said ‘stuff’ happened to be things they already knew by heart: operational planning, logistics, advanced tactics, budgeting, math that didn’t even compare to the various orders of ODEs they had to go through prior to joining the Space Force. Most importantly, Henry was already familiar with the management of large-scale missions – or as the Guild called them, Campaigns.



The general concept reminded him of MMO Raid content: massive operations where dozens of independent groups had to coordinate against world bosses and regional threats like legendary dragons. The Guild test had covered historical examples, from coordinated hunts targeting Tier 9 or 10 monsters to dealing with massive stampedes and their resulting evacuation efforts. Their recent defense of Eldralore Academy had essentially been an impromptu Campaign, though a rushed one.



The biggest challenge in Campaigns wasn’t the combat; not really. Most relevant Clans had the resources to tackle Tier 9s, and the best ones – those with ‘Exalted Paragons’, could take on Tier 10s. The adage back home still rang true here: *logistics wins wars*. Campaigns were no exception. 



Major clans like the Mithril Order served as informal leaders through reputation and influence rather than authority, not unlike how major raid guilds often took point on world boss events. Government representatives provided strategic objectives and high-level organization, while the Guild itself maintained information networks and basic infrastructure.



But at its core, success depended entirely on how well autonomous parties could work together. Henry had to smile at that part of the test – the Guild’s solutions weren’t far off from how NATO handled coalition warfare, just with more magic and monsters in the mix.



The monster physiology section had been particularly interesting, especially after Dr. Perdue’s work on the Sentinel Lindwyrm. Dragons were almost similar, especially when it came to those dense mana channels. Their entire physiological structure was built around magical integration, from reinforced bone structures that could channel elemental energy to specialized organs that could generate and store massive amounts of mana. Another reason why the Tier 10 Elemental Dragon in the Ovinne Mountains had drawn so much attention.



Naturally, a large portion of the test was about harvesting procedures; couldn’t let valuable dragon materials go to waste – or worse, unsold. Scales for armor and blood for alchemy were just the tip of the iceberg. The Guild’s cut from material sales alone probably explained why they left distribution protocols vague; let the Clans negotiate amongst themselves while the Guild profited either way. 



Dr. Perdue would probably have a field day if they ever managed to bring one down and secure rights from other Parties and Clans. The Mithril Order’s reputation and involvement probably gave them first pick, which explained how they maintained their edge in equipment.



Of course, it was all self-compounding. They get rich, fund more operations, get even richer, and put themselves ahead of everyone else. 



Their own party funds of nearly half a million lumens had seemed excessive at first – rewards from completed quests, the sale of Lindwyrm and Vorikha materials, and various rewards had added up quickly. Looking at the test’s cost breakdowns, it was no question why the Guild emphasized financial management so heavily. A two-week Campaign could burn through 100,000 lumens in basic supplies alone. Add in emergency reserves, potions, and new equipment, and high-tier adventuring started looking less like lucrative hero work and more like running a small military operation. 



Not that these constraints applied to Alpha Team. Armstrong handled all their supplies, and their ‘emergency reserves’ included everything from Apache gunships to Ccruise missiles – assets most of Gaerra didn’t even know existed yet. Their lumen reserves were purely discretionary, free to be spent on whatever opportunities arose during the Campaign. Perhaps Elara from the Mithril Order had caught a whiff of that when she tried to recruit them.



The remaining sections felt almost routine after their recent experiences; just monster ID, alchemy, basic questions about various flora and fauna. Nothing particularly surprising after facing Vorikhas and other high-tier threats. If anything, their practical experience had made these sections feel like afterthoughts.



The physical portion proved just as straightforward as the written exam. Wind and fog during the precision test hardly fazed them – nothing compared what they’d trained through back home. Even the extended range barely registered. A little simulated fog and wind was nothing compared to the real deal, and felt almost relaxing compared to Henry fighting for his life against the Sentinel Lindwyrm or cloaked Nobians moving through smoke.



The adaptive target phase showed more teeth. The proctors moved their targets with the same fluidity they’d seen when spectating Professor Valtor’s little demonstration out in the woods. The magical shields on the targets were new too, forcing them to adapt. But compared to what they’d done, it was still trivial.



“You have done well thus far,” Taldren said as they wrapped up with the second phase. “Yet this next trial, though greatly akin to the golem combat, demands sharper wits and steadier resolve. Attend, and I shall explain.”



He gestured to the training ground where several earthen figures were already rising from the soil. Unlike the simple rocky humanoid forms from their Tier 6 test, these were more refined, with distinct armor-like plating and articulated joints. Most notably, they had multiple cores. That alone garnered a raised eyebrow from Henry.



“Mark this well; each construct has not one core, but three. A single strike upon any will fell the beast, aye, but do not think this makes your task simple. These creatures are cleverer than their lesser kin, for they are guided by proctors.” Taldren pointed to a makeshift catwalk above the testing grounds. “They guard their weaknesses and strike where you are most vulnerable.”



The Guildmaster swept his hand over the training ground. The environment began to shift, sections of earth rising in the same way Kelmithus had done during their training prior to their ‘vacation’ to the Academy. From the looks of things, the terrain wasn’t entirely random. Despite the shifting barriers, clear lanes of fire and defensible regions. Like any well-designed combat arena, there were power positions and choke points – opportunities for those who knew how to use and abuse them.



“The arena itself shall mirror a true battlefield. Your shields will hold for three solid strikes, and no more. Should they fail, you are ‘dead’ and your test ends there.”



The golems finished forming – five of them. “Each construct bears purpose,” Taldren continued. “One shall shield, another shall strike from afar, and others shall close upon you with unrelenting force. Their tactics are their own, unrestricted by rule or pattern. Some may be merciful; others may show no quarter. I hold no sway over their choices, nor do they heed any limit. You must adapt not only to the constructs but to the temper of their masters. Captain Donnager, step forward. Enter the field when you are prepared.”



Henry analyzed the field, zooming into the distance with his IVAS. Uneven terrain with barriers, trenches, and elevated positions characterized the area. The catwalk’s elevated position gave the proctors good coverage of most of the field, but there were still some blind spots, hidden beyond large trees, boulders, and makeshift structures. One of them included a depression near some stone barriers – perfect place to set up shop for an ambush.



The challenge would be reaching it. He’d have to use the barriers and elevation changes to break line of sight during his approach. But first, he needed to identify the safest route.



The eastern approach looked promising. The tallest barrier would block the catwalk’s view for half the distance, then that trench would take him straight to the depression. The golems were still inactive in the center, likely waiting for him to step inside before starting their sweep.



Five golems; two proctors. One took two, the other handled three. Their formation suggested they’d coordinate well. Even if he took out the first proctor’s pair, that proctor could theoretically take control of some of the remaining units to maintain efficient distribution. 



But that assumed equal proficiency. Looking at their loadouts, the first proctor’s pair were clearly built for speed and maneuverability – lighter frames, streamlined forms similar to the skirmisher he’d seen Valtor control. The second proctor’s three were more varied – two with shields and heavy plating, plus one with a spear. 



Simple combined arms approach. The spear golem would keep him at bay while the shielded ones advanced, eating up his attention while the other two came in from the sides. Pure talent wouldn’t cut it here – fitting for Tier 7, yet a walk in the park given Henry’s background.



He entered the field, sprinting right. The golems angled towards him, but line of sight had already been shattered. Knowing that he went in this specific direction wouldn’t be enough for them to do anything meaningful. The two shieldbearers came lumbering after him, leaving their backs wide open as they rounded the barrier. 



Easy pickings, their cores basically begging to be shot. But Henry refrained – trigger discipline. The shield golems were tempting targets, sure, but popping them would just leave him staring down the real problems: the agile skirmishers and that spear unit. Bad trade.



The shield guys were slow, predictable; mostly just walking walls. Even if they managed to box him in later, he could deal with their plodding advance. The skirmishers, though – well, Valtor’s demonstration was enough of a reason to avoid fighting those types. Add a spear pinning him down, and he’d be cooked. Better to let the shields go and wait for a clean shot at the real threats.



He sank deeper into the trench. A stone dug into his ass – no Diddy, but what could he do except endure it and pray the skirmishers showed themselves soon? Of course, they somehow psychically knew about his *predicament* and took their sweet time. But his prayers were finally answered when the distant foliage rustled roughly a couple minutes after the shieldbearers had lumbered past. One skirmisher vaulted a low wall to his right, the other circling wide to the left. Perfect. They’d split up just like he’d figured, trying to cover more ground. Sucker move.



Two quick bursts and both skirmishers dropped. No muss, no fuss, but there’d be no more easy shots from here on out. He lowered his M7 and moved deeper into the trench. The next bend was another blind spot from the catwalk, offering a sliver of respite. He could make it there, easy enough, while they were still puzzling over the skirmishers and investigating the trench.



When he reached the bend, he risked a quick glance upwards. The two shield golems led the way, a mobile wall of stone. The spear golem trailed slightly behind, providing overwatch. He was directly perpendicular to the approaching golems. Angle right now wouldn’t cut it. 



He ducked back down and moved past the bend, deeper into the trench. He pressed himself against a wall, angling his body so he could see the approaching golems at a diagonal. *Much better*.



One of the shield golems faced ahead while the other angled its shield toward the trench on its right. Henry could see everything from his diagonal. The spear golem was tempting – a single shot could take it out of the equation entirely. But then what? The shields turn on him and he’s left without any way to actually get past the shields outside of a lucky flank or flashy movement.



Better to go for the arm joints and drop the shields. His first burst zipped toward the shield golem. The impact sent chips of stone flying, and the massive shield lurched to the side, momentarily exposing the golem’s flank. Before the second golem could react, Henry shifted his aim and fired another burst at its corresponding joint. That shield also swung wide, leaving all three golems now vulnerable.



Three shots, three kills.



The final golems crumbled, and Taldren’s voice rang out. “Well done, Captain Donnager.”



Henry climbed out of the trench, brushing dirt off his ass. That rock had done a number on him – his worst blunder in the entire exam, but fuck if he was gonna let anybody know he’d been touched by a rock. He joined the others by the observation area to watch the rest of the trials.



The rest of the team followed in turn, each handling the golems like it was just another day at the range. Light work, honestly, especially when compared to the shit they’d handled at GB-2. Not a single person had their shields scratched – a new record for them. 



Taldren had a few more examinees to go over, and although it would’ve been interesting to stay and watch, Henry didn’t want to piss off his grumbling stomach.



“Tavern?” he asked his team. Several excited smiles was all he needed to see.



The built-in restaurant was busy with the usual lunch crowd, if not lighter with the absence of the large Clans. Most of the adventurers grabbing food were lower-tiered, grabbing food between quests. Henry spotted a couple familiar faces from their brief time at the Academy, but no one worth interrupting their meal for.



His main concern was whether Taldren would finish his evaluations before they could finish their food. Hopefully not – *probably* not, given how tedious test-grading must’ve been without Scantron.



“So,” Ron said, scanning the menu he probably had memorized by now. “Anyone else think those golems felt a bit sluggish compared to Valtor’s?”



“Mmhmm.” Henry nodded, barely glancing at the menu. He’d been craving the fenwyrm steak since morning, and with their latest ‘culling’ back at the Academy, the Guild was bound to have a ton of quality fenwyrm meat. “No offense to the proctors but yeah, you right.”



“Yo, how crazy was that skirmisher though?” Ron asked. “Muhfucka moved like it was chromed up. Super speed and shit.”



Dr. Anderson raised his glass. “I can imagine that’s why you dropped ‘em first, eh, Donnager? Soon as you clocked what type they were?”



“Yup. After watching Valtor’s demo? Yeah, wasn’t gonna take any chances.”



“Dang, it’s just like that movie,” Ryan said, snapping his fingers. “Real Steel. Y’all seen it? The one with the robots?”



Hell, was there anyone who *didn’t*? That movie was a classic. “Yeah yeah, where they copy the movements –”



“Sure ‘nuff!” Ryan grinned. “Fella’s gotta know how to scrap to make his golems fight like that, don’t he?”



“Yeah, the proctors were probably support mages or something.” Isaac glanced up as the waiter finally arrived.



They placed their orders, throwing in some of the local juices to experiment a bit. A short while later, the server returned with their food – plates loaded with premium cuts that definitely came from that Fenwyrm culling. Henry was already halfway through his steak when Ryan spoke up. 



“Y’all hear the news ‘bout the Dean?”



Henry’s fork stopped midair. “Huh?”



“Lyrus. Bastard’s gone missin’, apparently.”



Yeah, that was news to him alright. Henry didn’t think he’d ever have to hear about Dean Dickhead again, but here he was.



“What happened?” Isaac asked. 



“Them Sonaran knights showed up lookin’ to ask him ‘bout them runes, but his office was clean empty. No note, nothin’.”



“Well shit.” Henry popped another piece of steak in his mouth. “Guess that explains how they got into that Central Tower.”



“Kind of a retarded move though,” Ron said through a mouthful of his own. “Shit’s basically an admission of guilt. But... damn. The Nobians for real infiltrated that deep? Insane.”



Pretty crazy to think about. Insane, truly, as Ron said. But honestly, Henry had enough on his plate – and not enough fenwyrm, by the look of it.



They finished lunch without rushing, opting for another round of fruit juices. Yeah, they could get up and dip; perhaps wait in the lobby, but it wasn’t like anyone was waiting for their table.



Almost half an hour passed with no word from Mira or any of the other Guild staff. How long *did* it take to grade a few tests anyway?



“Alpha Team! Taldren’s ready for ye!” Mira said, appearing beside their table.



Finally. Henry got up, finishing up his juice and leaving the payment for the bill. They followed after Mira, entering Taldren’s office. 



The Guildmaster shifted through papers, probably fresh from the graders. “Your proofs lie before me, Alpha Team. They speak well of your worth.”



Henry nodded. He’d gladly accept that praise.



Taldren set the papers aside. “Your advancement quest stands ready – a rescue operation most urgent. The Lost Seekers, a Tier 6 party, ventured forth to retrieve a Baranthurian artifact – a reliquary – from ruins in the Mirrowen Forest. They stand a day overdue, despite the trivial expectations of the quest. Their silence breeds grave concern.”



So, a rescue mission. Get in, smack some Nobians who’d probably tried to steal the artifact, and get out.



Taldren spread a map across his desk. “The Sanctum Arcanum commissioned this venture, yet speaks little of the artifact itself. More pressing still are local reports. Mere hours after the Lost Seekers found themselves lost, villagers began witnessing phenomena that speak of a spectral presence.” He paused and looked up, probably knowing this’d elicit some sort of reaction.



It did. Spectral? That alone tossed out everything Henry had anticipated out the window. But, just to confirm… “By spectral, do you mean…ghosts? And not, say, threats using invisibility magic?”



“Aye.” Taldren’s simple nod was a punch to the gut. “Your primary task is to find these ‘Seekers’ and return them safely. Should circumstance permit, complete their original quest. The Sanctum offers 100,000 lumens for the rescue alone, with an additional reward negotiable should you secure the artifact.”



Henry felt a migraine hitting him already. Monsters were straightforward enough; they were just deadly animals with magic. Nobian cloaking? Just people with blades and bows, who happened to have decent spellcasting. Even the Vorikha Apex and Sentinel Lindwyrm they could deal with conventionally. 



But ghosts? Well, there were tons of easy answers: holy magic, consecrated weapons, and so on. They had exactly none of those, except what they could buy. And while holy water was easy enough to find in shops…



For a split second he almost considered treating their ammo with it. Yeah, bad idea. Water and firearms were a hard no, holy or not. They’d need another solution. Maybe blades they could treat, but that was a problem for later.



“Alright. So, ‘spectral presence’… Do we know what the villagers actually *experienced* on site?”



Taldren steepled his fingers. “Those who venture near the ruins report a cold that cuts to the bone, as though an unseen hand of ice grips them. They speak of whispers, faint as wind through the trees surrounding the ruins, and fleeting shapes in the shadows, vanishing ere they can be rightly marked.”



Localized cold, then. Tied to the ruins. And the whispers… the effects seemed to be contained to the ruins themselves, at least for now. Whatever the phenomena was, something was *in* that ruin, producing them.



“Has anyone else gone missing?”



“Not as yet, and let us count it a blessing,” Taldren said. “Yet there *was* an incident, though no harm befell the men. A patrol of sentires, while keeping watch near the ruins, spoke of a wave of despair that struck them – an utter hopelessness. *Fear*. For most, it passed swiftly, but one among them was left greatly unsettled.”



Emotional influence. So the ghosts could also mess with minds. It also meant that possession might even be on the table. “Alright. And what are our conditions for mission success?”



“Rescuing the missing party remains the goal. Yet we know this – after a day’s passing, their survival grows doubtful. Should they be lost, your task is to recover what remains and identify or eliminate the cause of their fate.”



‘What remains.’ That sounded *real* hopeful. But there was not much else they could do here; turning down the advancement quest wasn’t an option, especially if they wanted to get to Ovinnegard on schedule. Henry had wanted to avoid anything to do with ghosts and apparitions for as long as possible, but if the Guild wanted him to play Ghostbuster, then so be it.



Their first stop was obvious enough: pick up some holy water. The five vials Henry split among the team were expensive as shit, and he still didn’t have a clue *how* he’d actually make use of it, but he wasn’t gonna argue against old sayings. *Better to have something and not need it, than to need something and not have it*.



Next on their list was to head back to base. It was in the opposite direction of the Mirrowen Forest, but apparently, Dr. Lamarr and Dr. Perdue had already prepared something in anticipation of supernatural threats. Having to deal with ghosts had been a topic of concern ever since they learned about their existence. After all, how could you kill something that was already dead? Hopefully, whatever solution they’d cooked up would be capable of making said threats die harder.

LTJ #10: Liminal Archives/Out of Context Omnitrix Supplement,JumpChain,1i5phds,2025-01-20 07:52:19,31,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1i5phds/ltj_10_liminal_archivesout_of_context_omnitrix/,Sin-God,BUILD,"Today we’re doing another double header, this time of the [Liminal Archives](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ey4a2T_sw3jKYnwdd3Yl3AFw_DyZKWE/view?usp=sharing) Backrooms Continuity, and to celebrate one of our first monster jumps we’re tacking on [OoC Omnitrix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_iSKXV0yorkZmOxiNKSw7uAelT-Mh8C/view?usp=sharing). It’s worth mentioning that, seeing as this is the first OoC we’re doing, this is not the last one I plan to use. Much like when I use my own jumps, I’ll not be stacking many of these one after the other, but as previously mentioned we’re here for a long ride so expect to see more of them eventually.

Special note: I am a frequent OoC maker, and I quite like them. OoC Omnitrix was made by DeverosSphere, and it’s fantastic. This jump is for the sake of future growth, it doesn’t make us busted by itself; its strength depends on the jumps you visit. The Backrooms, PARTICULARLY this continuity, is not filled with mighty monsters but it has some odd life forms that we’ll be scanning and acquiring. I am grabbing/becoming the Omnitrix now and suffering for it, for its utility and future power, not to make THIS jump a breeze.

As an additional special note this is the first jump that was ORIGINALLY supposed to be earlier in the chain. I originally positioned this as jump #4, before deciding to push it back. I pushed it back… five times before deciding to place it here (and even then I originally wanted this jump to be LATER on, but decided that it’d be fun to put at #10, after MULTIPLE single jumps in a row). 

**Build Notes**

Liminal Archives

Drawbacks: Bad Rep (100), Entity Magnet (200), Weak Stomach (200)

Total Budget: 1500 CP

Origin/Starting Location: The Office (This normally costs something but I rolled a dice to determine my starting location and I’m gonna say that narratively this is represented by LTJ and their benefactor coming together and agreeing to let random chance determine the selected origin in exchange for it not costing anything regardless of the origin).

Perks: Rain Catcher (Free), By the Hair of My Chin (100), The Calm In The Storm (200), Unfazed (400)

Items: Outpost Appolonian (300), Entangled Batteries (300), Today’s Supplies (Free), Proper Equipment (100), Luxury Produce (100)

OoC Omnitrix

Drawbacks: Boss Rush (600), Friendly Problems (400), Living In Exciting Times (300), Competent Enemies (300), Pet Food (200), The Good People (200), Dead or Alive (200), Sore Thumb (200), Inconvenients (100), Wanted (100), X-Rated (100), Double Trouble (100), Silent World (100), Low Budget (100), Thugs For Days (100), Stranded (100), Find and Seek (400)

Total Budget: 4600 CP

Origin: Ultimatrix

Perks: All of them. Like, no seriously every single perk. I went and did the math and the way it plays out is that it costs 1400 to get all of the general perks (not counting the interface perk which we didn’t get the juiced version of). From there it’ll cost 1300 for the Omni-Kix and 1300 for the Biomnitrix. The final set of perks will only cost 600 as that’s our origin. We don’t get any aliens built into the omnitrix, as an additional balancing mechanism given how juiced our perks from here will innately make us.

Items: Both items, which are free.

**Story Notes**

Our jumper starts off on a stranded island in the middle of an unknown level of the Backrooms. They immediately leave by *Jumping*. When they jump they are pulled to Level 5 of the Liminal Archives Backrooms, *The Office*. They are also immediately jumped, which doesn’t go well for their attackers, and they are aware of the fact that they need to collect various items to ensure their survival. 

The Office level of the Liminal Archives Backrooms is a chill space that is completely devoid of entities. It is an empty, infinite office, that while not without its dangers is pretty inarguably the second safest level of the primary LA backrooms (with Almond Fields, which is not canon, taking the cake as far as most dangerous levels go). LTJ immediately deploys one of their bars in one of the larger rooms they find in the office space, which is itself populated in part by the inhabitants of UNCB Outpost Hartkirch. This gives LTJ, who in a setting like this is a goddamn miracle worker, a steady supply of loyal allies and friends. 

LTJ, armed with clones thanks to one of my favorite clutch items; the *Essence of the Assassin* deploys clones throughout the Backrooms. These clones track down the items that are a part of the *Find and Seek* drawback, and in so doing manages to snag the first forms their omnitrix lets them transform into, which include both Hounds and Rollers. These forms are just massive and feral pill bugs and dogs, but with LTJ’s nasty suite of omnitrix abilities they can turn into freaky versions of these life forms such as hyper evolved hounds or freaky, spiked rollers. 

LTJ also brings back an old, handy perk, *Daily Chores*, which they use to focus their social skills into overcoming the *Bad Reputation* drawback they opted to take. They use their advanced scientific skills to aid the UNCB, while using *Dating Simulator* to socially dance through the challenges of not being trusted. On an institutional level factions throughout the Backrooms don’t trust our wacky scientist, but on an individual level LTJ soon proves worth their weight in diamonds, by freely healing various people, producing remarkable resources with their Minecraft perks, and crafting all sorts of quintessential goods for the people of The Office. They quickly become a beloved leader, and in months people leap to their defenses when they get attacked by generic thugs, and even before then dolls, robots, and golems protectively keep them safe. They are also equipped with both the powers of *Wario* and *Minecraft gear*, as well as stuff like their personal scale amped up *Atomic Blaster* which they’ve been steadily powering up when and where they could.  

Every year they collect the items from *Hide and Seek*. After they deal with that drawback they focus on various objectives that are only doable because of the very specific way we’ve handled this chain so far. They slowly connect various settlements using *Jumper*, *Keeping Up*, and stuff like *Wholesome Knowledge* to create stable portals leading from level to level, while occasionally turning individuals into loyal followers. They also persuade different local leaders to turn criminals over to them for *Reprogramming*, which they do either through powerful charisma or by doll-ing the ones who did the most significant crimes. After a while they persuade different locations to give them some space to create labs which serve as the staging grounds from which local entities can be studied and scientific means of fighting them can be determined. Thanks to the persistence of fiat-backing their negative reputation is never fully overcome, but their legitimate benevolence and the incredible results of their work result in LTJ becoming a trusted ally of individual leaders in a multitude of groups, and connecting various communities, thanks to their (for this setting) absurd out of context powers. In a setting like this a stable ability to move from level to level freely is invaluable, someone who can connect a place like the office with the something like the flooded city, or even connecting the Almond Fields with everywhere else is a godsend of unbelievable value.  

LTJ grabs various Entity forms while steadily collecting the required items to handle their drawbacks, and eventually, with hardwork and the steady improvement of both their supernatural science and their jumping ability (mixed with the Map item from Jumper) manages to forcibly connect pathways that lead to different limspace systems! *Limspace Systems* are networks of connected Limspaces (levels for those more familiar with baseline Backrooms terminology), essentially they are sub-continuities within the grand continuity of the Liminal Archives. This tremendous discovery allows wanderers from different spaces to interact, letting people who dwell in the safety of the [Crimson Forest](http://liminal-archives.wikidot.com/crimson-forest) meet people in [The Halls](http://liminal-archives.wikidot.com/the-halls), or folks adventuring in the dangers of the [Basalt Depths](http://liminal-archives.wikidot.com/basalt-depths). This discovery is really neat and lets LTJ snag some exceptionally dope forms, such as that of an Infernosquid (a human-like, in terms of intelligence and size, octopus capable of surviving in the incredibly hot waters of the Basalt Depths), and the forms of *Lanterns* guardian-entities who protect the people dwelling in the Crimson Forest for reasons that are, as of yet, unknown. 

LTJ’s ability to connect disparate parts of the true grand multiverse of the Liminal Archives results in a multi-year period of relative peace and prosperity. There are conflicts of course, such as when the Queen of Mabgift; Mab the Undying, tries to invade the Crimson Ocean, but efforts by LTJ and allies from both *The Crimson* system and *The Middengrounds*, as well as LTJ’s own magitech golems, now empowered by Omnitrix generated weapons and armor see the day saved. Another example of a grand conflict is a multi-year saga that includes the first time LTJ tries to embrace the power of ice, and includes an encounter they have with *Verglasking* the monarch of an area within Shivergate (a level of the Thalasso system). LTJ surprises hundreds of people by using their mad, restorative supernatural science to cure the deadly affliction known as *Verglasking’s Curse*. 

The conflict ends with LTJ confronting the frozen sovereign and discovering that their *Observe* ability has chosen now to evolve, becoming a power that lets them learn someone’s history with a single use. They engage in a fierce battle in the heart of the Verglasking’s labyrinth, and win a brutal conflict as *Skul the Hero Slayer*, mixing cloned attacks, flaming magic, and even incorporating shit like *Wario* abilities to slowly whittle down the frightening ice-king. After a brutal knock-down drag-out fight, the monarch is impaled on an enchanted, and blazing, spear and LTJ uses the power of *Assassin Essence* to forcibly end the sad tyrant’s life. They take the cold monarch’s skull and add it to their collection. 

The last few years LTJ spends in this take on the Backrooms they exist almost entirely within the Basalt Depths. During this time they live primarily in the vast city created by the *Magmatic Spelunkers*, where they work extensively with the local government to create all manner of frighteningly effective magitech for the sake of finding rare materials and also creating technology that allows the Infernosquids to explore more of Thalasso (and are rewarded by the Infernosquids with an incredible amount of trust and access to their own resources). LTJ spends entire weeks as an Infernosquid, and their abilities endlessly fascinate the leadership of the Spelunkers who helps them explore the Basalt Depths for the sake of acquiring more forms (and of course LTJ profitably helps their new homies in turn, both protecting the settlement as a Platinum Behemoth and also helping the place expand). They also grow familiar with the various mutational features of their omnitrix, having started off by becoming primal smilers (gigantic monsters the sizes of buildings) and by the end becoming a skilled user of their newest nature to become things as fierce as hybridized Inferno-Behemoths or Platinum-Smilers. When the jump ends, LTJ leaves it with considerable more experience and a hilariously powerful alt-form, provided our lad goes to settings with dangerous monsters.

**Perk & Item Notes & Synergies**

Gonna begin by talking about the Liminal Archives stuff. Our build from the Liminal Archive jump is surprisingly balanced, and has us start off in the chill Office level. I grabbed that origin’s entire perk tree, and I also grabbed an anti reality-warper perk. From there our items are decently varied. I started off by investing in two powerful things; a safe zone and a limitless power source, and snagged some small QOL items, mostly for the sake of bargaining with other peeps. These items are meant to be used for post-apocalyptic or historical scenarios, and I have plans for our quirky jumper to visit both of those kinds of jumps in the future. 

Now for the big dog… Let’s talk about Luciano the Omnitrix. In case you don’t know what I’m talking about, OoC Omnitrix doesn’t GIVE you an omnitrix it TRANSFORMS you into one. And that’s neat. This is also a heavy duty jump, though by itself the way I did it it’s gonna take some time for this new alt-form to really develop and become a super powerful thing. Still, we can already feel the potential just by looking through the perks available here. And even with JUST backrooms entities in this continuity we’ve got some surprisingly neat transformations, especially given the ways we can modify the forms we gain. 

Even in the general perks section Unitrix and Master Control (the penultimate perk and the capstone respectively) are beefy. Unitrix lets you use the powers of a lifeform in your transformation playlist without transforming, and Master Control lets you transform freely without time limits and even without physically handling the physical parts of the omnitrix. 

Each origin has at least one super handy perk. With Omni-kix one perk lets you freely heal people (and in its upgraded form lets you freely heal yourself!), while the capstone lets you make specialized armor for any form. We have every upgrade of every upgradeable perk, meaning we can create a range of armor and weapons for a plethora of purposes. Biomnitrix has its capstone which lets you hybridize different types of lifeforms, doing things like giving a human gills or wings if you have a lifeform in your DNA Matrix that has the features you want to give yourself. One of its upgrades lets you dynamically generate DNA that pushes a form in a direction you want it to be pushed in, such as making it smarter or stronger. Ultimatrix has a lot of fun toys, but one of its neatest tricks is that it generate DNA for a chosen form’s ancestors and give you forms based on the ancestors of a given DNA sample, which is WILD. It can also generate Ultimate Aliens based on predictions about the future of a species or even forcibly evolve an alien in a direction that is the product of a simulation where a species goes to war with itself and thus is incentivized to push its existing suite of abilities in new and cool directions. This means you can get, for example, ultimate hounds or primeval smilers.  

LTJ had, and still has, the essence of the assassin which grants shapeshifting but the omnitrix is greater than simple shapeshifting. The one flaw it has is that it’s not capable of doing stuff like mimicking the supernatural, so it can’t mimic ghosts, but I can figure out ways around that given time, especially with the buffed version of Generic Minecraft’s *Wholesome Knowledge* perk (which is a way I unintentionally rewarded myself for waiting to visit this jump). 

There are plenty of fun things we’re taking from this jump. Among other things we have our first building sized forms, the ability to forcibly evolve our forms, and a fiat-backed mechanism which allows us to snag the abilities of lifeforms we come across. The omnitrix is stunningly versatile, and is one of those hilarious items that any science-jumper worth their salt needs to eventually acquire. Some of the other fun stuff we’re taking are our first forms adapted to underwater shenanigans, and some unique skulls such as that of the ice king from Shivergate. The omnitrix is a VERY fun toy, and much like the *Essences* (Essence of the Mad Doctor came in clutch when dealing with the Ice King’s curse, and the Assassin Essence is one of those quintessential parts of LTJ’s kit) will be getting used all the time. I am delighted to see what sort of adventures we get up to armed with this hilariously handy device. "

Some news about the development of Voyi.

I drew sprites for all current characters in the game.

I also began to process the structure of the armor from prototypes. Not much interesting to tell or show yet.



It's also early to show the armor itself, as it requires normal maps and such, but not the Arsenal icons.

Also, after thinking about it, I've decided to start the synchronization of devlogs in the BlueSky network.

See you soon and good luck!

Ilunor’s response… was not one I at all expected.

Because out of all the reactions I had on my bingo card, clapping definitely wasn’t on the list. 

“And so the earthrealmer finally shows her true colors.” The Vunerian responded with a prideful smirk and a slow purposeful clap, causing me, Thacea, and Thalmin to cock our heads in solidarity.

“I’m sorry?” I responded.

“You claim to have visited these so-called ‘stars’, correct?” 

“Well, yes. But I don’t see how—”

“My apologies.”  He interjected, a sarcastic smile plastered across his maw. “I am mistaken. Because not only have you claimed to have ‘visited’ these ‘stars’... but you likewise proclaim *mastery* over them, along with the so-called ‘void’ which ‘hangs above’ too, no?” He continued, stringing me along.

“Yeah, that’s right.” I took the bait. 

“Then you may consider this conversation *over*.” Ilunor proclaimed succinctly. “For you have… as the merfolk say — taken the bait.”

“Please just get to the point—”

“You’ve fallen into my trap, bitten off more than you can chew, made a dragon out of a wyrm!” He prattled on, bringing in adage after adage until he finally leveled his eyes towards me in a clear fit of frustration. “To put it bluntly, earthrealmer, you’ve proven yourself an unreliable raconteur. You have fallen for the oldest trick in the book — the acknowledgement of an impossibility. What’s more, you’ve gone so far as to have built off of this impossibility, firmly entering the realm of pure fantasy.” 

I took a deep breath, matching the Vunerian’s gaze even as he stepped off of his armchair, his feet click-clacking back onto the marble floors.

“Alright Ilunor, explain *exactly* what issues you have with my claims.” I continued with a sigh, eliciting a twitch from one of the Vunerian’s eyes.

“I asked, plainly, whether you have visited these so-called ‘stars’. Your answer, twice now, was yes. Twice then, have you proved that you know *nothing* of the nature behind these specks of light. Twice now, have you taken the opportunity to inflate your ego, to act a contrarian whenever possible. Because twice now, you’ve claimed to have visited a nonexistent destination, a phantom object, a mirage — a mere artifact of light.” The Vunerian turned towards Thalmin now, as if to invite him to his side. “How can you claim to have visited what are merely *tears* in the fabric of the tapestry? By this logic, I could claim to have visited a desert mirage, or the end of a rainbow.” The Vunerian paused, allowing those words to sink in. 

And sink in they did. As I finally determined exactly *where* his point of fundamental systemic incongruency was. 

“To further claim *mastery* over them… is beyond ludicrous, akin to me claiming mastery over a rain cloud or a bolt of lightning!” Ilunor doubled-down, grabbing a piece of paper on the table as he spoke, proceeding to poke multiple holes in it with his claws, then finally holding it up to the fireplace. “It’s as outlandish of a prospect as me claiming to have both visited and declared ownership of the light poking through the holes of this parchment!” He announced through a run-on huff, prompting me to wrack my head around for a proper response.

Or more specifically, as I used every ounce of empathy I could muster in order to see things from his perspective.

“Alright then, Ilunor.” I began with a steady breath. “Please enlighten me.” I continued, garnering a wide look of surprise from all eyes present, including the Vunerian’s. “Explain to me *exactly* what you believe to be the tapestry. Tell me what these tears *are*, and what’s actually *behind* them.” I offered patiently, prompting a shift in the Vunerian’s derisive persona as it evolved into something more ponderous. “Prove me wrong.” 

For once throughout this whole outburst, the man willingly stopped to take a moment to consider my request. 

“I will require a half hour, Emma Booker.” He spoke softly. “I believe it would be best to *show* you. Moreover, I believe I can make use of this time to extinguish two phoenixes in a single storm.” 

… 

**50 Minutes Later**

… 

“Okay, so the Academy *does* have its own library, then? Like, in addition to *THE* library?” I reiterated, eliciting a nod from Thacea. 

“Indeed, Emma. Though it is not as well known nor as prominent as *The* Library. Moreover, we have yet to require its services. Most of what is available in the Academy Repositories, is simply reference material and cultural works made available to complement the Academy’s curriculum. This is where I assume Ilunor has gone.”

“Right, and on that note—”

**SLAM!**

“—there he is…”

The Vunerian returned, his scales seemingly revitalized and rejuvenated, as if his intended destination had breathed life back into his skin.

“Wait, *which* library did you say you went to again?”

“Both, earthrealmer.” The Vunerian muttered out under a grumble. “*The* Library, and the Academy Repositories. The latter is where I managed to procure *this*.” He gestured at the sight-seer gripped firmly in his hands. 

I nodded, reflecting on how silly it was of me to have assumed that the Academy wouldn’t have *its own* internal library, instead relying on *The* Library for everything. 

Then again, earthly expectations in the Nexus tended to always find a way to be overruled, so I didn’t beat myself too much over that little revelation. 

“So, considering you got that thing from the Academy Repositories, I’m assuming you went to *the* library in order to fulfil your mysterious weekly arrangement with it—”

“Let us focus on the task at hand, earthrealmer.” Ilunor interjected, promptly slamming the door shut to prove his point, as he quickly got to work on the sight-seer. 

This particular sight-seer appeared to be far more polished and refined as opposed to Thalmin’s ‘bear-trap clamps on a book’ sight-seer, but not as sophisticated nor showy as Ilunor’s sleek and gilded setup from last week’s sight-seer trip. 

Because instead of the gilded hard-cover edges with seamless fold-over stitching, this book just seemed… normal. Like your regular everyday hard-cover textbook — complete with a title that looked more stenciled-on than it did hand-written or scribed-over. 

This trend of relative functionality over aesthetics continued as Ilunor went to work, revealing the orrery within the pages as a dainty, yet clearly functional ‘device’ with little in the way of ornate compositing or gildwork. 

“We’re jumping ahead in the curriculum for this explanation.” Ilunor began with a coy smile. “From what I understand, this should be a subject firmly in Professor Articord’s domain. Though as I stated before — extracurriculars are my forte.” 

With a surge of mana radiation—

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 250% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—the room was once more bathed in a light that started to ‘melt away’ the world. The whimsical almost ‘organic’ nature of the hologram, clashing greatly with my expectations of the typical ‘vector by vector’ and ‘block by block’ holographic boot-up sequence found in the ZNK-19.  

The floors opened up to ‘reveal’ solid ground in the form of a grassy sand dune, while the walls and roof slowly faded away until all that remained around us was an open expanse of starless night sky. 

“I must thank you, Cadet Emma Booker, for being so kind as to revel in your own downfall.” He began. “As it will be my honor to deconstruct your false claims, by demonstrating to you exactly *how* your assertions are but a fanciful impossibility.” 

No sooner after he spoke were we introduced to a sight I hadn’t at all expected. 

Because instead of the magical hologram simply raising our perspective ‘upwards’ towards the starless skies, we were instead met with a more ‘interactive’ lesson; a shadow hovering overhead signaled that we were about to begin our ascent in a more ‘hands-on’ way.

“A ride up to the skies on a mount? Can we at least pick our beast of choice?” I commented jokingly.

Ilunor’s shit-eating grin however, only grew wider with my response, as he took great pride in what he was about to say next.

“Oh *earthrealmer*, how *quaint* of you to assume that we’re about to ride *beasts* up to the skies!” He paused for dramatic effect, as the shadow being cast from above grew larger and larger, until finally we were met with the source of the Vunerian’s rekindled pride. “Because in actuality — the Nexian Crownlands have long since freed noble civilized society from the shackles of beastly reliance.” 

What sat in front of us, awaiting our ‘entry’ across a long red-carpeted gangway, was a literal airship.

And this wasn’t just an ‘airship’ in the traditional sense, nor even in the contemporary sense, but in the most *literal* sense of the word.

Because awaiting our boarding… was a ship that looked to be a cross between something out of the age of sail, and the most Jules Verne-meets-fantasy thing I could’ve ever imagined. 

The whole vessel looked like one of those extra-long sailing ships at the cusp of steam technology, with sails and rigging dominating the superstructure on deck; rising several stories tall and dominating our line of sight.

However, the lower my gaze went along the main body of the vessel, the more the anachronisms seemed to grow, as the ship tapered more aerodynamically the further down I looked. The mother of all anachronisms however didn’t even require an ounce of scrutiny, as this aspect of the ship was just as, if not more prominent than its sails — its **wings**.

Or more accurately, its many *sets* of wood and brass wings, each ending in some sort of a glowing crystal encased in a rune-engraved brass cylinder that looked almost like a jet nacelle if I squinted my eyes right.

I couldn’t help but to stand there, too stunned to speak, my gaze ending up fixated on the bow of the ship, as the anachronisms ended at the overly-long bowsprit that dominated the very front of the vessel.

“Well come along now, earthrealmer! We haven’t all day!” Ilunor announced with unrestrained glee. Though we didn’t really have to physically ‘move’, considering the magical hologram did it all for us.

We arrived on the ship’s promenade deck to decorations and a deck-layout that seemed like something pulled straight out of the Titanic. Though amidst the decorations, the wood decking was interspersed with many pipes, funnels, and eclectic glowing artifices that looked more functional than they were decorative. 

Or at least, I *assumed* that to be the case.

The whole ‘vessel’ began its ascent soon enough, with Thacea and Thalmin’s features displaying a sense of restrained awe, almost like they both wanted to ignore everything around them.

Ilunor’s unbridled ascent into superiority seemed to be unquestionable at this point. 

Though sadly, this wouldn’t continue on indefinitely. At least, not with the sorts of questions I had in store for him.

“Alright, alright. I think we need a time-out before we ascend any further.” I finally managed out, overcoming the shock and disbelief through a combination of both willpower and the burning curiosity welling within me.

=====

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30, Living Room. Local Time: 2245**

**Ilunor**

“What is it *now*, earthrealmer?” I managed out with a frustrated sigh. 

“So, I know better than to doubt this thing’s existence. It doesn’t seem all *too* surprising given what the Nexus is capable of.” The earthrealmer responded, and in a rare instance of lucidity — acknowledged what had *always* been the truth. “But I have to ask, **how exactly does this whole thing work**?”

That single question sparked an entirely new wave of realization deep within me.

As conflicting notions of reality and posturing started to reshape my expectations of the earthrealmer for better or worse.

It was clear, through both the manaless sight-seer and her flying golems, that the earthrealmer *did* possess the ability of flight.

And as manaless as it was, I had no choice but to accept that as reality as I saw it.

Aethra-Primus, after all, could easily justify the existence of her ‘drones’ — its principles reflected in common beasts of flight.

The disconnect however no longer stemmed from whether or not these manaless newrealmers were *capable* of producing artifices of magic-less flight, but instead, the *extent* to which this capability could be scaled to Nexian achievements.

It was well understood that the principles of Aehtra-Primus were *limiting*. 

This was reflected in both the natural order and the civilized world. 

With regards to the former, it was clear there existed a functional… *limit*, where size and scale no longer allowed for non-magical flight. 

A dragon, after all, was only capable of flight through its innate use of magic.

With regards to the latter, there simply existed *no* means of achieving flight without *some* form of magical imbuement. Whether this was in the *power* behind a vessel, or the defiance of leypull itself.

Simply put, there were principles of flight which *could* excuse and support the earthrealmer’s current *proven* capabilities. Her flying artifices, merely being the *absolute extent* to manaless flight.

Anything larger was an abject impossibility. 

This realization instantly casted doubt over the validity of the larger flying artifices seen in her sight-seer.

All of this would explain why she was so awed by the sight of this most typical of flying craft.

It would explain her burning curiosities over a vessel otherwise only possible in the imaginations of a manaless world. 

“Ah! Interested in *flight* now are we? I recall the previous week’s conversation very well. You were just oh-so *confident* in your supposed mastery over flight.” I began, taking a moment to consider my next words… ultimately deciding on committing to my stand. “Your ‘drones’, along with your ‘mothership’ artifice are clearly the extent of it, yes? I believe we’ve now arrived at the point where you find yourself perplexed by the actual sight of more *impressive* constructs, prompting me to cast doubt over your grandiose claims; considering your need to inquire—”

“This thing *cannot* fly.” The earthrealmer interrupted bluntly, completely disrupting any semblance of rhyme or conversational reason.

“I beg your pardon—”

“Not using conventional flight mechanics anyways.” The commoner continued her tactless assault. “You’re flying a literal *ship*, Ilunor. An *ocean-faring ship*, if that needed to be specified. Now, if I were back home, then I’d have called this bluff from the get-go. That’s because under conventional flight mechanics, this thing would have no chance of getting off the ground.” The earthrealmer paused, making a point of gesturing towards the Aetheric Leypushers. This was followed by yet more of her suspicious moments of purposeful conversational pauses — a social tool that she was surprisingly adept at. 

“There’s no way you’re generating enough lift with those wings to keep this whole thing aloft, and most definitely *not* at the speeds we’re currently traveling.” She added suddenly, my eyes narrowing as she spoke. “Now I don’t know how much this whole thing is supposed to weigh, but it doesn’t take an aeronautics engineer to take one quick look at this thing and say—”

“You’re describing *Aethra-Primum*, Cadet Emma Booker.” I interjected curiously, mildly impressed by the earthrealmer’s *intimate* understanding of Aethra-Primum, but more so baffled by how she could be applying such *base* principles on a craft such as this.

This left me… conflicted, uncertain if she was grasping at straws at trying to analyze a craft beyond her capabilities, or whether she was truly hinting at the impossible — that vessels of this size and scale were *possible* without magic.

“Aethra-Primum?” She eventually responded. 

“Natural flight.” I replied cautiously. “Unassisted and unaided by magical means. Or what you refer to archaically as… *‘flight mechanics’*, though I cannot see why you would utilize such an overtly complicated descriptor for a phenomenon that is inherently unworthy of it. The term is part of the three fundamental avenues of flight, as observed in both the natural and civilized world.”

I gestured for the earthrealmer to follow, as I subconsciously directed the path of the sight-seer towards the wings. “It is impossible for an Aethraship to fly using only the principles of  Aethra-primum. For they are… limiting, if not impossibly binding in their restrictive rules. This is why instead of *conforming* to ‘*flight mechanics*’, we instead *circumvent* it, freeing ourselves from the natural order. This is the reason why all vessels utilize either the second or third fundamental avenues, rather than persisting with the limiting first.” I paused, considering my next words carefully, as I casually gestured towards the Aetheric Leypushers, or more specifically — the catalyst crystals within. “The artifices you see in front of you are designed to circumvent the limitations of Aethra-Primum, granting this vessel the ability to defy the forces of leypull itself.” 

The earthrealmer seemed particularly baffled by the latter term, her exaggerated body language hinting at the shock welling within.

It was expected, after all.

The knowledge of such fundamental principles are typically rarely understood in most newrealm—

“And by ‘leypull’... you mean a natural fundamental force, correct? The… universal force of attraction between all bodies of matter? The one that ‘pulls’ you down to the ground?” 

I took a moment to pause.

To gather my thoughts.

To consider the implications of just how… *casually* the earthrealmer addressed an otherwise distant concept to most newrealm inductees.

“Yes, earthrealmer.” I nodded, attempting to ignore the implications of this. “How do you—”

“I just wanted to double check, because back home, we have another term for it — gravity.” 

This confirmed it.

The fact they had a local term for it outside of Nexian nomenclature, made it clear that *this* was a principle they discovered independently. 

“So you *do* understand.” I managed out reluctantly, before shifting the assault back towards the earthrealmer. “*But!* Do you understand the concepts of Aethra-Secundum and Aethra-Tertius?” I inquired with a grin.

“No. But judging from what you were getting at with this ship, I’m assuming Aethra-Secundum and Aethra-Tertius refer to the principles of magically-augmented flight, right?”

“Correct, earthrealmer.” I nodded, relieved not only at the earthrealmer’s expected ignorance on the matter, but likewise at my efforts in wrestling back control of the conversation. “But not *entirely* correct. For you see, both of these terms refer to the *extent* of magic being utilized for flight. Aethra-Secundum referring to magically *assisted* flight, and Aethra-Tertius referring to *entirely* magically-driven flight. The former utilizes magical means to augment all manner of worldly properties affecting lift; while its designs remain partially shackled to natural limitations. The latter, however, is completely unshackled from it.” 

“And given how *ludicrous* this ship is, I’m assuming it’s entirely magically-driven then.” The earthrealmer replied tentatively.

“Yes.” I nodded pridefully. “This vessel was designed from its onset as a complex symphony, to be performed by an orchestra of various enchantments, artifices, and spells, all at the beck and call of its conductor — the Shiplord.” 

The earthrealmer paused, her whole body tensing, as if physically attempting to grapple with the leypull of the situation. 

“So let me get this straight.” She began with a shaky breath. “Aethra-Tertius, amongst other things, involves a particular form of magic. Be it a rune, a spell, an artifice, or *something*, that’s able to stably sustain the defiance of leypull — gravity — itself?” 

That particular question… wasn’t what I was expecting, and it wasn’t for the earthrealmer’s typical bluster or foolishness — no. Instead, it was for its *myopic* focus.

“Yes, earthrealmer.” I began with a furrowing of my brows. “Though I do not see how that is in any way the most impressive aspect of this fine vessel, as there exists a wide *plethora* of spells and artifices that far surpass that particular enchantment.” I offered, attempting to gauge just *why* this rather unassuming aspect of the ship was what caught the earthrealmer’s undivided attention.

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30, Living Room. Local Time: 2252**

**Emma**

I hit the mute button immediately after that confirmation, looking at the EVI with wide and excited eyes. “EVI, designate additional primary objective — information gathering and active study on the potential for *scalable* artificial gravity.”

**“Acknowledged, Cadet Booker.”**

This discovery… could change *everything*.

If the principles behind this casual use of artificial gravity could be extracted or reverse-engineered, then we could be looking at a complete rewrite of space tech and industries as we knew it.

Gravitics, and by extension, the manipulation of gravity through artificial means wasn’t an immature field by any measure, in fact, it was at the *heart* of FTL and the key to its operation.

It was the only means through which warp bubbles could be formed and sustained.

But it was not without its limitations.

First and foremost, was its energy-intensive nature. A fact which kept gravitics from reaching the heights of science fiction, namely, in its application to recreating earth-like gravity en masse. 

This was why spin-gravity was still king across every ship, station, platform, moon and planet, even after all these years.

However, that wasn’t the only functional cap we faced with the current model of applied gravitics. 

Simply put, there existed a sort of diminishing return when it came to gravitics in its application in FTL. As the energy requirements needed to sustain a warp bubble through gravitic manipulation lost all sense of efficiency past 800c. With an exponential increase of energy required the further you attempted to push past that ‘sweet spot’.

This meant that whilst Alpha Centauri was a comfortable two-day journey away, a trip to Farpoint Station — the furthest claimed extent of GUN territory — took a whopping four months.

Whilst the extranet did its part to keep every human merely an insta-call away, and despite most humans living comfortably clustered around Sol, this functional limitation proved to be *restricting* for far-flung space exploration and our reach into the wider galaxy.

Sure, there were ships purpose-built to brute-force higher velocities using ludicrous amounts of power.

But those were *exceedingly* rare, and relegated to either experimental craft, or a few deep-exploratory and military roles.

Thus, without a fundamental change in either the conventional model for warp-field generation, or an explosion in power-generation technology — the 800c ‘cap’ would remain.

That was, until today.

As an entirely new chapter in history could be written.

I was so lost in thought that the Vunerian had to physically kick me to pull me out of my reverie.

At which point, he crossed his arms, gesturing towards the skies. “We’re arriving, earthrealmer. So before we continue, are there any questions you have regarding—”

“So how common are these ships?” I practically blurted out.

“Abundant. At least as it pertains to the crownlands.” Ilunor responded warily, as if shocked by my sudden pique in interest.

“Uses? What do you use them for? I’m only asking because you keep mentioning how portals have effectively cut the distance between spaces, so given how easy portals are to access—”

“The transportium network still necessitates *vehicles* to replace the backs of the beasts of burden, eathrealmer; barring of course direct point-to-point teleportation. I believe the town’s many bulk carriages are enough to go off by, no?” 

“Right, okay, what else?” I shot out even more excitedly.

“Personal yachts, pleasure cruises, arcane research and study, exploratory endeavors into the deep farlands, as well as martial applications to name a few.” The Vunerian responded, trying his best to keep up as my overactive imagination and burning desire for *more* kept the man backed up into a proverbial corner.

“And the means of generating artificial gravity utilizing magic. Just how common, easy, or accessible is—”

“Will you *please* save these questions for *class*, earthrealmer?!” The Vunerian managed out under a strained breath. “We’re *very* close to our destination, so will you please just focus on—”

“Okay okay… last question. You mentioned Aethra-Secundum and Aethra-Tertius as being something you observed in the natural world too, right?” I quickly asked, as hundreds more questions bombarded my brain. 

“Yes? What about it earthrealmer—”

“So is *this* how dragons are able to fly?!” I shot out excitedly, taking even Thacea and Thalmin by surprise. “Is this how magical creatures with questionable aerodynamics are capable of flight? By effectively circumventing the ‘constraints’ of conventional flight mechanics?” 

Excitement welled within me, prompting my curiosity and overactive imagination to take the driver’s seat if only for a moment. 

This… clearly wasn’t what Ilunor was expecting, which prompted Thacea to enter the fray, answering those questions on his behalf.

“Yes, Emma.” The princess began. “Indeed, this is how a large proportion of avinor are capable of flight, as the principles of Aethra-Primum are insufficient in granting us this natural gift.” 

My eyes started to grow wide from all of these revelations hitting me all at once. 

An… indescribable *magical* feeling welled up inside of me, bringing out the child within me to the forefront if only for a moment.

“This makes sense.” I admitted with a sense of wonder. “Every being in the Nexus and the Adjacent realms evolved *with* magic, it’d only make sense to make use of it on an innate level.” 

“A topic which has already been *covered* by Professor Vanavan’s first class, Cadet Emma Booker.” Ilunor chided with frustration. “That is, if you were even focusing in class — on the subject of magic use in mages and in beasts.” 

With a shrug and a sudden slowdown of the vessel, to the point where it looked as if we were truly defying gravity now, we ‘arrived’ at our destination.

“Behold, earthrealmer.” The Vunerian gestured… at what just seemed to be yet more patches of dark skies hanging ominously above us.

“I’m afraid I’m not really seeing what you’re getting at here.” I offered with a cock of my head.

“Then perhaps *this* will help.” The Vunerian grinned widely, dematerializing the sails and thus allowing us to get even closer to the ‘tapestry limit’. “A caveat, earthrealmer: this maneuver is an artistic rendition, as performing such an act would be otherwise impossible. As any being or object that touches the tapestry would be instantly teleported into the transportium network. I’ve had a few of my fellow wing-mates confirm this through brazen and foolish temptations of fate during our drake-flights.” Ilunor remarked, just as the ship stopped mere feet from the limit.

At which point I finally saw it.

A vague, shadowy, almost wispy fog-like membrane covering what should have been even more endless expanses of night sky.

“What… the heck is that—”

“The grand tapestry, Cadet Emma Booker.” Ilunor proclaimed proudly and with a wide grin. 

Looking down, the endless expanse of land seemed to stretch out in every possible direction, though the farthest ‘edges’ of this seemingly endless expanse didn’t necessarily form a horizon, but instead a sort of foggy haziness.

I tried not to focus on that right now however, instead, fixating on this otherworldly alien membrane that coated the skies.

“Alright Ilunor, assuming the veracity of this sight-seer is solid, all you’ve proven is that there *is* something covering the skies.” I began. “This doesn’t answer my question of what lies beyond—”

The Vunerian snapped his fingers, as several ‘tears’ began appearing in the wispy membrane.

Soon enough, patches of *light* emerged, revealing what seemed to be an undulating… *soup* of pure white-yellowish matter. 

“Beyond the tapestry is the Primavale —  a realm of incomprehensible *fullness* and energy. It is from the Primavale that the Farlands are consistently formed, and the ceaseless process of Nexian expansion is maintained.”

Ilunor… had lost me at that point.

Or at least, my more grounded side.

Thankfully, I still had my suspension of disbelief, courtesy of my more imaginative side.

“Alright… the *infinite Nexus* theory is something to be touched upon later, so let’s focus on the skies here. If your worldview is right, then what you’re basically claiming here is that your ‘stars’ were once orbs of mana that were just… hanging around this physical tapestry? Like little lamps or spotlights?” 

“In a manner of speaking, yes, Cadet Emma Booker.” The Vunerian nodded pridefully.

“And so after your King defeated and consumed them, you were left with just an empty ‘tapestry’, without those balls of mana?”

“Correct again, earthrealmer!” He smiled brightly.

“And now you’re saying that there’s this… ‘primavale’ behind the tapestry. A Nexian phenomenon that you’re trying to apply to *all* adjacent realms?”

“And with holes and imperfections in said tapestry allowing the light of the Primavale to come through, yes! I knew you’d understand, earthrealmer.” Ilunor beamed brightly, standing tall and proud now. “Moreover, unlike the Nexus, adjacent realms simply do not have the ability to naturally gain access to the Primavale. This is why adjacent realms are finite in nature, whereas the Nexus is infinite. The night tapestry teases you with what you could have, but that which is impossible to gain.” 

The deluxe kobold had just about reached maximum ego saturation by this point.

“So *now* do you understand, earthrealmer? Now do you comprehend exactly *why* it is impossible to have ‘reached’ said ‘stars’?”

“I mean—”

“They are merely *tears* in the fabric!” He interjected.

“Yeah, yeah… I understand Ilunor.” I began.

“I see you finally admit your submission to reason—”

“I understand why you believe this to be the case, at least.” I interjected, once more pulling the wind out of his sails. 

“Earthrealmer, please, be reasonable—”

“I’ll wait to cast judgement on the nature of the Nexus *next time*. I won’t jump to conclusions just yet, especially considering how you *are in an entirely* different realm of existence with different universal rules.” I finally admitted, the imaginative side of me willing to give him that much leeway, at least for now. “However, I expect the same sort of respect in return. Because by that same logic, not every adjacent realm is going to be operating using the natural laws of the Nexus. Now I can’t speak for all realms, but at least when it comes to my own, I can safely say that your natural laws simply do not apply.”

The Vunerian’s features dropped to one of frustration once more, as he yanked us out of the sight-seer abruptly, and back onto solid ground.  

“What you speak of is an impossibility which I cannot—”

**“ENOUGH!”** A loud growl suddenly drew both of our attention out from our fighting as we both turned to its source — Thalmin.

“I apologize for my brashness, but we are getting *nowhere* with mere words.” He spoke sternly towards Ilunor before turning towards me. “Emma, I am assuming you have evidence to support your claims?”

“Yeah, I do, actually.” I beamed out, garnering a nod from Thacea and an anxious smile from Thalmin. 

“Then let us see it.” The wolf declared, prompting our move from the living room and into my dorm.

=====

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30, Thacea and Emma’s Room. Local Time: 2300**

**Emma**

It took only a few minutes to prime up the ZNK-19, with my ARMS once more carrying out most of the grunt work in setting up the tarps.

“If I were to entertain such a preposterous claim, earthrealmer, then we must address the proverbial dragon in the room.” Ilunor began with a skeptical breath.

“What is it, Ilunor?”

“It is clear we have reached a *practical* impasse. As discerned from our experiences in my sight-seer, you clearly lack the means to prove your claims.”

I let out a huge sigh, my ARMS stopping to accentuate my frustrations. “Go on?”

“Whilst you have demonstrated a surprisingly robust understanding of Aethra Primum, and indeed, your *drones* demonstrate your people’s ability to apply this understanding to an extent… I cannot help but to cast doubt over your ability to extend this beyond mere *toys* and *golems*.”

I paused, feeling my eyes twitching at that logic. “Didn’t you already see our planes in the presentation—”

“Indeed I did.” Ilunor acknowledged. “However, I have reasons to doubt the veracity of such sights. This is because I find no plausible means of suspending my disbelief with regards to *manaless flight* applied to such scales. Especially when such a prospect implies that such feats are possible using the limiting principles of Aethra Primum.”

I could practically *feel* the fundamental systemic incongruency in the air. Prompting me to take it slow, if only to make sure my answers could effectively address his remaining doubts.

“And why *wouldn’t* it be, Ilunor?” 

“Because many have tried and all have failed.” Ilunor responded bluntly. “There is no known means of manaless power capable of lifting a being larger than a tearplitter eagle off the ground. Anything larger requires *at least* the aid of enchanted wind-projectors in order to create the power necessary to achieve lift.” 

“So what I’m hearing here is that you simply don’t believe that a manaless equivalent is possible?” I started to grin widely, as my inner speed demon cackled within. 

“I am surprised that you would acknowledge your own folly, Cadet Emma Booker.” Ilunor nodded with a smirk. 

“And I’m surprised you’d be so brazen with your assumptions, Ilunor. Because my drones? They’re nothing compared to what I’m about to show you.” I paused, flicking on the ZNK-19, as its towers began whirring up.

“Our kind has been *obsessed* with reaching the skies for millennia. And where our lack of wings or mana has kept us from achieving it the easy way, we didn’t just pack our things and called it a day — no. We were ravenous, relentless in our pursuits, determined to get there in spite of our ‘limitations’—” I paused, as the scene around us slowly loaded up vector-line by vector-line, assembling together one of the most iconic scenes that started it all. “—even if it meant we had to do it the hard way.”

LTJ #8: Generic 50s Sci-Fi,JumpChain,1i4yxbk,2025-01-19 08:54:20,40,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1i4yxbk/ltj_8_generic_50s_scifi/,Sin-God,BUILD,"Today we’re visiting [Generic 50s Sci-Fi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GwNRpgTlP59jCJuMAYyd8X25k9qecwHo/view?usp=sharing), to further advance our jumper’s scientific arsenal and to grab some fun toys. I’m hyped for this particular jump, and delighted to have the chance to further customize our scientific jumper in the wake of their newly acquired ability to build magi-tech. 

**Build Notes**

Starting Location: New York City

**Story Notes**

Our jumper starts off in New York City, and is a well-known roboticist with a weird health condition that makes them need to wear a specialized suit at all times. They start in their government lab, and are immediately called upon by Uncle Sam to help deal with the first outbreaks of the radioactive ants, a few of which are empowered by a baby version of the Daikaiju drawback and thus are much bigger than their siblings. In this moment our jumper’s past investments in scientific perks really come in clutch, with *Keeping Up* meshing with *Come Up With A Plan* and allowing LTJ to easily come up with specialized tech that they then integrate into golems and robots from past jumps. 

They speedily make an impressive army of robotic servants outfitted with powerful technology which is promptly enhanced by Minecraft enchanting. Their robots are unleashed on the giant ants and they defeat the inhuman menace with impressive ease, thanks to LTJ also creating quiet assassin bots empowered with essences and perks to go after the scarier ants. The government, grateful for LTJ’s assistance, rewards them with hilarious amounts of personalized resources, such as some diamonds and pumpkins, opting to trust LTJ when they promise Uncle Sam some fun toys. 

Our jumper is aware of the drawbacks they’ve chosen and are, for now, more than happy to accept them. They know about stuff like how they won’t be believed when they make claims, so they are choosing to preempt a lot of stuff by being proactive. When the first of the 20 *Feature Presentation* events they’ll be dealing with is done, they deploy dolls that they have fed dollmaker essences and use them to convert key officials in governments across the planet into dolls. This is necessary since the jumper only has one protective suit and their clones still have the *Alien Atmosphere* drawback. Turning essential political figures into dolls is a bit of a cheat, but given the nature of some of the drawbacks we’ll be tackling later this is really helpful to do right away and also pretty damn essential for long-term survival of humanity in this setting seeing as an xenocidal alien race is on their way to kick humanity’s teeth in. 

LTJ’s faction expands as the protagonist deftly deals with assorted sci-fi shenanigans. They infiltrate assorted governments and create anti-ant government offices and departments in their very early days in this setting, and also create and hostilely takeover corporations that will subtly push humanity towards larger population centers that are easier to defend than rural areas. Along the way LTJ diligently creates stockpiles of weapons, robots, and equipment meant to protect humans from assorted monsters and other threats. LTJ’s preemptive preparations prove essential when large monsters and mutant animals all over the world rampage, and it is their magitech robots that save the day, repeatedly, though invariably with critical assistance from local governments. The collaborations, which occasionally include direct and personal appearances by the reclusive scientist, save tens of thousands of lives and lead to a hilarious amount of American popularity. In less than a few months every single ant is wiped out, and whenever they reappear they get stamped out in hours. LTJ also, as a minor thing, creates an organization whose job is to sing LTJ’s praises and to proliferate their tech throughout the world, to give people powerful tech to stay safe, and to increase the odds that, when aliens arrive, everyone trusts LTJ and does what they say to most effectively coordinate a planet-wide response to the incoming alien invasion.

About two years into their stay in this setting, the first aliens from the xenocidal alien race arrive. LTJ waits a beat, keeping an eye on them just long enough to confirm that they are hostile, and then immediately has robots attack and destroy them when they confirm that they are alien scouts for the xenocidal faction. The alien scouts are part of a hivemind, and in their final moments they let their allies know about powerful magitech robots that *shouldn’t* exist and yet do. And this commences a subtle war waged between the xenocidal aliens and LTJ (who is, themself, an alien in this jump! *Advanced Being* actually makes you a human-like alien.). For the next few months LTJ critically stymies the alien advance, skillfully fucking with them and disrupting their plans. Their agents encounter and both dispatch and capture aliens, all while uncovering a network of collaborators who they proceed to doll and use as both double agents and to further prepare humanity for an all-out invasion. LTJ fully outfits critical areas in the infrastructure of the planet’s key population centers, as well as populates new areas and creates powerful factories. 

When the aliens arrive about four years into LTJ’s stint here, LTJ immediately goes on the offensive and makes full use of their resources to rebuff the first wave of alien attackers who assaulted numerous critical cities including ones like Moscow, Paris, Buenos Aires, Montreal, New York City, Cairo, Tehran, and other essential cities. The attack still kills tens of thousands, but without LTJ’s targeted interventions the number of dead humans would have skyrocketed. The aliens, fed up with LTJ’s bullshit, try to assassinate LTJ by targeting New York City with a weapon of mass destruction, but our lad has *Jumper* (and also the ability to teleport using their bars and restaurants), and even then LTJ greatly limits the destruction by using Minecraft magitech to evacuate thousands of people in what they dub “Experimental” teleporters (they are perfectly safe, and are one of LTJ’s neatest secret tools, designed using *Jumper* tech mixed with Minecraft magic). The attack not only doesn’t kill LTJ, it is hilariously easy for our jumper to use their charisma and perks to persuade people to unify against the alien menace, which in turn gives our hero incredible access to resources and manpower (which snowballs when added to what LTJ has successfully acquired over various jumps and what they carefully acquired during the buildup to this moment in time.). 

In the skies above the planet’s surface pitched battles rage between magitech robots and alien forces. Each captured alien and bit of surviving alien tech that humans recover is swiftly transported to LTJ’s labs and studied to aid in the expediency of *Keeping Up* and *Counter Attacker*, and thus each victory builds. LTJ also participates in battles on the surface of the planet, using their powers and their *Atomic Blaster* to scare foes and deal with more of the fiat-backed ants. They empower some of their robots with essences, and powerfully use *Jumper* to create a line of nasty robots who are tasked with *Jumping* into alien vessels and assassinating alien commanders. At this point LTJ is already capable of understanding the aliens and gives some of the robots *Skull Absorption* and a *Skeletal* alt-form of their own, and is using essence-empowered humans as some of their agents. The alien command vessel is quickly occupied, and in some cases parts of it are blown the fuck up by teleporting magitech bombs that the aliens just can’t counter. Alien technology, particularly force fields, are copied by LTJ and methods of circumventing these defenses are developed in the *Government Lab* and deployed against the aliens (but empowered by magic). Eventually LTJ develops a sort of super-nuke that they teleport into the beating heart of the alien mothership, before detonating it and decimating the aliens (Funnily enough this is also a viable form of self defense. Demolitions Expert makes you immune to all of your own explosions, and a nuke you create would count!). Days later they develop smaller bombs, force fields that intelligently block these explosions and use them to stop the ants once more. These safe detonations also provide humanity with a decisive means of winning against the ants for long enough to last the remaining duration of the jump. 

The war against the aliens took years, and was filled with some brutal suffering. When it ends there’s mere days left in the jump, and LTJ breathes a sigh of relief. While millions die in the conflict it is not the brutal xenocide it should have been thanks to our jumper’s meticulous intervention. The jump ends and LTJ gets to go visit new settings, after enduring some truly brutal drawbacks.

**Perk & Item Notes**

Our protagonist is now armed with some curious toys. Among other things they have access to a *Psionic* class now, and a curiously human-like alt-form that is able to *Evolve*. The fusion of *Advanced Being* and *Psychic Perceptions* gives us the remaining suite of basic psychic abilities that we did not have after visiting Jumper (such as mind-reading and pre-*Chronicle* telekinesis), which is fucking rad. This is cool, and is their 3rd alt-form after *Keg-Human* (which they use, but is not especially common), and *Skul the Jumper Slayer* (which they regularly use). They also have more strange skulls for their *Skul* form, having taken the skulls of monsters they helped stop. 

They also have more emergency science perks, ones geared toward warfare and disaster relief (scaled to tackle imminent threats). Some of their new items include a perfect immunizer to all illnesses, a handy personal weapon that is shockingly strong, updating academic credentials, and a very neat government lab. I considered a number of builds, including one for *Them* and for soldiers, and it was the government lab item that caused me to take the scientist origin. 

One thing that is rather neat is that our Jumper is now immune to the killing curse. The Antibiotic Serum renders our jumper immune to supernatural causes of instant death, which not only no-sells the killing curse it even lets you look at a basilisk with no harm (and our *Essence Alchemy* ability, which they’ve made liberal use of, lets us freely share our immunities). It is weirdly powerful, though I suppose that makes sense seeing as it costs 400 CP and is non discountable. The antibiotic serum allows us to visit certain settings that were previously filled with some dumb bullshit but also had neat toys (I’m exceedingly paranoid and always refuse to go to places like HP until I have fiat-backed protection against AK & other instant death things). I… actually only realized that Antibiotic Serum lets you say no to AK today (the day I’m writing this post, which is not the same day as when I’m posting it), which is very funny. To be fair, Generic 50s Sci-Fi is one of those jumps I didn’t read in detail until sometime after it was posted. I’ve read through the other 20th century movie genre jumps in more detail, and look forward to visiting Hammer Horror and 80s sword and sorcery (among other FF jumps), both of which I plan to visit.

This is mostly a jump meant to help us amp up our science, and is also a fun historical jump since it lets us visit a version of 1950s Earth. I want to slowly expand the sort of settings LTJ visits, especially since one minor thing about my other big self-insert chain was that it included visiting a range of settings. That’s one of the few things I loved about that chain compared to this one, and is something I’m planning to change about this jumper, slowly expanding the sort of settings LTJ gets to visit. I did not imagine that our pathway to silly magic settings would take us to Generic 50s Sci-Fi but this is the fun of intentionally visiting settings you normally wouldn’t, you get to come up with fun synergies. This setting also allowed us to get a nice little suite of psychic powers (some of which we’ll be getting enhanced in future jumps anyway) and test out magitech in a semi-modern setting (and it didn’t disappoint!). This didn’t enhance us in ways that are big and scary, but it does enhance us in ways that are deceptively powerful. We may not be leaving here as a freaky alien with a wicked hive mind, but we are leaving here as a survival-oriented scientist that can now handle some truly nasty supernatural abilities, and can easily scare some impressively frightening villains.

Is the Myth of 'Memory Metal' resurfacing with SMA (Shape Memory Alloy) x Time Crystals venturing into the final configuration of Memory Alloy x Quantum Super AI x Neural Networking: The Craft,HighStrangeness,1hzf4n2,2025-01-11 23:50:59,16,0.74,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1hzf4n2/is_the_myth_of_memory_metal_resurfacing_with_sma/,Zestyclose_Door_7508,UFO,"The myth of Memory Metal  is old, following a timeline of Roswell Crash Retrieval taken to WPAFB (Wright-Patterson Air Force Base)7, studied by Battelle.

The witnesses who handled the Roswell material claimed it had the ability to return to its original shape upon being wadded or crumpled.  Battelle documents by FOIA from the Defense Technical Information Center in 2009 and 2010 restates Battelle’s work on a memory-metal alloy called Nitinol, which it conducted for WPAFB in 1948-49.

https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/2009/05/21/memory-metal-files-are-missing/28868099007/

Nitinol hits news. 

>These shape-shifting capabilities are all thanks to a bizarre kind of metal called nitinol, a so-called **shape-metal alloy that can be trained to remember its own shape.**

>Nitinol, made of nickel and titanium, works its magic through heat. To “train” a paper clip made of nitinol, for example, you heat it at 500 degrees Celsius in its desired shape, then splash it in cold water. Bend it out of shape, then return the same heat source, and the metal will eerily slink back into its original form.

A range of research came out of dark in public domain in recent years definitely following long decades of reverse technology research, now allowed, for preparing announcement of introducing new technology masking the source research. For example,

>A groundbreaking discovery in metamaterial design reveals materials with built-in deformation resistance and **mechanical memory**, promising advancements in robotics and computing.

>Researchers from the University of Amsterdam Institute of Physics and ENS de Lyon have discovered how to design materials that necessarily have a point or line where the material doesn’t deform under stress, and that even **remember** how they have been poked or squeezed in the past. These results could be used in robotics and mechanical computers, while similar design principles could be used in quantum computers.

>The outcome is a breakthrough in the field of metamaterials: designer materials whose responses are determined by their structure rather than their chemical composition. To construct **a metamaterial with mechanical memory**, physicists Xiaofei Guo, Marcelo Guzmán, David Carpentier, Denis Bartolo, and Corentin Coulais realized that its design needs to be “frustrated,” and that this frustration corresponds to a new type of order, which they call non-orientable order.

**Unlocking the Secrets of Mechanical Memory in Metamaterials**


https://scitechdaily.com/unlocking-the-secrets-of-mechanical-memory-in-metamaterials/

>The **digitally programmable material exhibits remarkable mechanical capabilities, including shape-shifting and memory**, stress-strain response, and Poisson’s ratio under compressive load. Furthermore, it demonstrates application-oriented functionalities such as tunable and reusable energy absorption and pressure delivery. This breakthrough material serves as a stepping stone toward the development of fully adaptive soft robots and smart interactive machines.

The spiral gets deeper with Liquid Metal Memory.

>In a breakthrough that brings to mind the T-1000 from Terminator 2, researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing have developed a fully flexible resistive random-access-memory device, known as FlexRAM, using a gallium-based liquid metal (GLM) to write and read data.

>This new liquid metal RAM, which can withstand nearly any deformation, uses reversible electrochemical oxidation to modulate the overall conductivity of the target liquid metals. Published in the journal Advanced Materials, the research details how GLM droplets undergo oxidation and reduction mechanisms in a solution environment that mimics the hyperpolarization and depolarization of neurons. 

**Liquid metal RAM is first step towards shapeless computing — as well as spineless robots with octopus-like features and robots from a popular 90's Sci-Fi movie**

Time Crystals are summoned.

>With the ability to forever cycle between two states without ever losing energy, time crystals dodge one of the most important laws of physics — the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the disorder, or entropy, of an isolated system must always increase. These bizarre time crystals remain stable, resisting any dissolution into randomness, despite existing in a constant state of flux. 

>Inside the ""box"" of Google's Sycamore, we can view the quantum processor's qubits much like we would our coins. In the same way that the coins can be either heads or tails, qubits can be either a 1 or a 0 — the two possible positions in a two-state system — or a weird mix of the probabilities of both states called a superposition. What's weird about time crystals, von Keyserlingk says, is that no amount of shaking, or zapping from one state to another, can move the time crystal's qubits into the lowest energy state, which is a random configuration; they can only flip it from its starting state to its second state, then back again. 

>""It just sort of flip-flops,"" von Keyserlingk said. ""It doesn't end up looking random, it just gets jammed stuck. It's like it remembers what it looked like initially, and it repeats that pattern over time.""

**Otherworldly 'time crystal' made inside Google quantum computer could change physics forever**

**The crystal is able to forever cycle between states without losing energy.**

https://www.livescience.com/google-invents-time-crystal

The most intriguing aspect of the whole endeavour starts to take shape with Lockheed Martin, NASA, DARPA and AFRL join  in a foursome.

>Lockheed Martin will work with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, until November 2006 to ""develop and demonstrate technologies for a seamless, aerodynamically efficient, **aerial vehicle capable of radical shape change**"". The contracts are the latest in a series of US morphing studies by AFRL's Air Vehicle Directorate, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and NASA. The AFRL's **continuous moldline technology (CMT)** programme evaluated elastomeric matrix materials reinforced with stiffening rods that could slide within the matrix to achieve high deformations. Recent tests on CMT structures showed the capability to stretch and shrink by 30% as well as bend and twist.

>NASA's studies have mainly looked at the bending and stretching qualities of resin transfer moldings, piezoelectrics (which contract or expand on application of electric current) and **shape memory alloys that change shape with thermoelectric input**. The aim is to develop a design with an 8% increase in rolling moment using wing twist, a 10% increase in rolling moment using a hingeless aileron and an 8% increase in lift using a hingeless flap.

Now, the missing piece, as since the beginning of the 'Program', is the neural networking to initiate the mindblend with the Craft; the Craft will instantly go where we wish it to go. The only question will remain if the Memory Alloy entangled with the Consciousness of the controller of the Craft present inside (or controlling via quantum telecommunication from the 'Other Domain') is guided by the controller's memory or its own memory."
What is DePIN?,DePIN_Pulse,1hy0eza,2025-01-10 04:05:48,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DePIN_Pulse/comments/1hy0eza/what_is_depin/,Strong-Leg-3531,,"An Introduction to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

# Introduction

If you’ve been following Web3 trends, you might have come across the term “DePIN,” short for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network. DePIN projects focus on building real-world infrastructure—like IoT networks, energy grids, and telecom towers—using decentralized blockchain principles. It’s about creating and managing physical systems collaboratively, without relying on centralized entities.

Why does this matter? DePIN changes how we finance, operate, and maintain critical infrastructure. By distributing control among participants, it makes systems cheaper, more accessible, and resilient.

# What is DePIN?

* **Decentralized:** Instead of being controlled by one company, infrastructure is operated by a network of independent participants.
* **Physical Infrastructure:** This includes real-world hardware like devices, networks, and utilities.
* **Network:** A system of nodes (people, machines, or organizations) working together via blockchain-based protocols.

# How does it connect to Web3?

* **Blockchain & Tokens:** Blockchain records ownership and transactions, while tokens incentivize participants to contribute resources like bandwidth or energy.
* **Smart Contracts:** Automated rules manage rewards and ensure trustless interactions.
* **Decentralization:** Instead of trusting a single entity, participants rely on the network’s code, reducing risks like a single point of failure.

DePIN brings decentralization into physical systems, offering efficient, transparent alternatives to traditional centralized models.

# Examples of DePIN Projects

https://preview.redd.it/wkumge8ut4ce1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d92ec205a87869dd028ce655fdebce3ede6a7f0

**AI and Computing**

* [Render Network](https://rendernetwork.com/): A decentralized network that provides GPU power for rendering tasks, used by AI and 3D artists. Contributors earn tokens by sharing unused computing power.
* [Golem](https://www.golem.network/): A global, decentralized marketplace for computing power. Participants can rent out unused CPU or GPU resources to run AI models, simulations, or other workloads.

**IoT Networks**

* [Helium](https://www.helium.com/): Participants install “Hotspots” to create a decentralized wireless network for IoT devices. In return, they earn tokens for providing coverage.

**Automotive Data**

* [DIMO](https://dimo.org/): Drivers connect their cars to a network, sharing driving data and earning tokens while gaining insights into their vehicles.

**Mapping**

* [Hivemapper](https://beemaps.com/): A global map built using footage from dashcams, with contributors earning tokens.

**Weather Monitoring**

* [WeatherXM](https://weatherxm.com/): A decentralized network where weather station owners share real-time data and earn tokens.

**Energy Grids**

* [Energy Web](https://www.energyweb.org/): Supports peer-to-peer energy trading and green energy solutions.

# Benefits of DePIN

* **Transparency:** All transactions are logged on a public, tamper-proof ledger.
* **Resilience:** No single point of failure—if one node goes down, others keep the system running.
* **Cost Savings:** Community-run infrastructure reduces operating costs.
* **Community Ownership:** Participants earn rewards and have a say in the network’s future.

# Challenges

* **Scalability:** Handling large volumes of real-world data is demanding.
* **Regulation:** Governments may resist decentralized models due to licensing and oversight issues.
* **Technical Complexity:** Setting up nodes or managing tokens can be difficult for new users.
* **Adoption:** Convincing businesses and communities to switch to decentralized models takes time and proven success stories.

# Conclusion

DePIN is bringing decentralization into the physical world, offering a new way to build and manage infrastructure. From IoT networks to AI computing to energy grids, it has the potential to make systems more efficient, resilient, and community-driven.

What do you think? Are DePINs the future of Web3, or just a passing trend? Let’s discuss in the comments!"

\-The rebels of Val Royeaux are kept at a stand still, Halamshiral repels the darkspawn siege.

\-Guard-Captain Aveline attempts to hold the corridor until the evacuation is complete. Her forces are saved by a sudden surge of demons pouring out of the abandoned Hawke estate, causing enough chaos for Aveline’s forces to retreat. Merill’s body is never recovered.

\-Orzammar goes dark. Scouts to the city report that doors are barricaded shut from the outside

\-The Wardens of Amaranthine keep and the Awakened manage to route the vast majority of darkspawn away from Redcliffe, but it’s still not enough to save the city.

\-Redcliffe evacuates to Skyhold





\-Venatori presence in the Free Marches is fully eliminated. The remaining Free Marcher forces unite under Prince Vael to begin pushing south again towards Amaranthine Keep.

How Can I Monetize My 4090 for Passive Income? GPU Compute and Decentralized Nodes Advice Needed!,cryptomining,1hxdt49,2025-01-09 09:20:29,3,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptomining/comments/1hxdt49/how_can_i_monetize_my_4090_for_passive_income_gpu/,kungabungalow,QUESTION,"Hey everyone,

I’m exploring ways to **generate passive income** with my system by running **decentralized storage nodes, compute workloads, or validator nodes.** I’m hoping to offset some of my hardware investment and get involved in decentralized projects without having to babysit the setup 24/7.

Here’s my current setup:

* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 9700X
* **GPUs:** RTX 4090 (planning to use this for GPU-intensive tasks), GTX 1070 (might dedicate this to compute or as a backup).
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR4
* **Storage:** 10TB HDD (considering Storj or Filecoin), 4TB + 2TB NVMe SSDs (available for cache if needed).
* **Internet:** Upgrading to **1 Gbps fiber** soon.

# What I’m Considering:

1. **Livepeer (Video Transcoding):** Seems like a good fit for the 4090, but is it competitive enough to generate solid returns, or are people undercutting each other?
2. **Storj/Filecoin (Storage Nodes):** Would adding another **10TB HDD** significantly boost earnings, or is it better to focus on compute workloads?
3. **Golem/Render Network:** Is renting out GPUs like the 4090 a viable way to earn passive income, or is this market already too saturated?

# Questions for the Community:

* What’s a good mix of GPU and storage nodes to build a diversified, ""set-it-and-forget-it"" passive income setup?
* Are there any **validator nodes** or decentralized hosting services that work well with a setup like this?
* Any tips for managing bandwidth-heavy workloads so I don’t slow down the entire house?

I know this isn’t a ""get rich quick"" kind of thing, but I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve run similar setups!

Thanks for your insights!"
How Can I Monetize My 4090 for Passive Income? GPU Compute and Decentralized Nodes Advice Needed!,gpumining,1hxdqqg,2025-01-09 09:17:15,5,0.73,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/1hxdqqg/how_can_i_monetize_my_4090_for_passive_income_gpu/,kungabungalow,,"I’ve got a **RTX 4090** that I want to use for **GPU-based passive income** and maybe some **video transcoding or compute sharing**. I’m familiar with traditional mining, but since that’s not viable anymore, I’m looking at other decentralized workloads like **Livepeer**, **Golem**, or **Vast.ai**.

Here’s my current setup:

* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 9700X
* **GPUs:** RTX 4090 (primary GPU), GTX 1070 (spare—open to suggestions on how to use it).
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR4
* **Storage:** 10TB HDD (already thinking of running Storj), NVMe SSDs for caching if needed.
* **Internet:** Upgrading to **1 Gbps fiber** soon.

# What I’m Considering:

1. **Livepeer (Video Transcoding):** I’ve heard some people earn decent returns, but what’s a good `pricePerUnit` to attract jobs without giving my compute away for nothing?
2. **Golem/Render Network:** Is it realistic to rent out a 4090 and actually make passive income, or would I be out-competed by bigger farms?
3. **Vast.ai:** I’ve seen people rent their GPUs through Vast.ai—would I be better off setting competitive pricing here vs running nodes like Livepeer?

# Extra Question:

Any tips for managing bandwidth-heavy GPU tasks while living with family? I’m planning to upgrade to **1 Gbps**, but curious if I should use **QoS settings or dual connections** to avoid bogging down the whole house.

I’m not expecting massive profits overnight—I just want to make the most of the hardware I have and offset some of the costs. Any suggestions on how to set up a reliable, passive income stream would be awesome!

Thanks in advance for your help!"

Can we make this post a thread to summarize all the ways of making passive money with an idle computer ?,passive_income,1huzbdc,2025-01-06 08:43:46,12,0.78,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1huzbdc/can_we_make_this_post_a_thread_to_summarize_all/,KlausWalz,My Experience,"I recently got an i9 computer from the trash (yeah you red this correctly) and spent a lot of time searching for all possible ways of making money by just using or overusing it. I will start by listing here all what I know and if you guys are interested I will format the post and it can be a reference for everyone !

To suggest something to add, it has to :  
\- Be done using some computer that we suppose is turned on 24/7  
\- Be **PASSIVE.** Just a first setup and that's all

*things that I either tried and/or have a proof of them working and being able to generate actual money*

\- PoW CPU Mining : you probably saw it coming, huh ? If you have a good cpu, you can use to mine a cryptocurrency that's ASIC resistant, meaning it can only be mined using regular cpus (and not dedicated machinery like Antminers, used to mine bitcoin).  
Now let's be honest, if you pay for electricity most of these won't make profits, but if you believe in the crypto asset to go up in price, you can hold and sell it later. Some of those crypto is XMR and I think it's the most famous one (correct me if wrong ?) plus it has actual use cases, websites like [minerstat ](https://minerstat.com/coin/XMR)can help you calculate profitability.

**- PoW GPU Mining** : literally the same of what I was saying before, but here you mine using your GPU. Again, in most cases you will generate money in crypto but assuming you pay electricity it can not be profitable... Here is a [blog post](https://www.blockpit.io/blog/best-crypto-to-mine-at-home) that talks about such crypto

\- **Selling excessive bandwidth :** some websites like Honeygain or Earnapp provide apps for selling a tiny bit of your network bandwith and pay you once you hit a certain amount using Paypal. There are other services, but I tried all of them and only the two I cited before pay a respectable amount of monet (20 dollars every few months, not much but honest work). Also, if you refer your friends in honeygain, you and them get both extra gains, you can use my [honeygain link](https://r.honeygain.me/HATEM0E151) if you want a referral. If you don't, simply check them out on google.

  
Things I heard about, never tested :  
\- Golem network  
\- Hosting your own server to cut on hosting costs for your website or drive  
\- Hosting a crypto Node ( currently making my research about this, needs, however, a high early investment to start)  
\- Mining Shia crypto ( a crypto mined using hard disk space, does that even profit ?)  
\- [https://vast.ai/hosting](https://vast.ai/hosting) : some service where you provide a gpu for people that wanna train models ?

I hope you guys have other, amazing, ideas :D"
Mega Man 3 Improvement Patch Appreciation Post,Megaman,1hudvpy,2025-01-05 13:42:53,17,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaman/comments/1hudvpy/mega_man_3_improvement_patch_appreciation_post/,Supah_Cole,,"I've been a big Mega Man fan since about the time I was 11 or 12, a few years over a decade ago, and I've played everything sans the Battle Network and Star Force titles from Powered Up and MM1 all the way to ZX Advent and Legends 2. It's stayed with me through about thick and thin.

And as the only new content we've gotten since I became a fan were MM11, a few Legacy Collections here and there, and a few bits and bobs in Smash Bros, I've been exploring the rest of the gaming sphere with all the free time that leaves me in waiting for more official content - and I have to say, the fanmade improvements to the basics that Capcom provided us with back in their heyday is really something else. Specifically - the [X5 Improvement Patch](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6131/), [Mega Man: The Sequel Wars](https://sequelwars.itch.io/mega-man-the-sequel-wars-episode-red), and the [Mega Man 3 Improvement Patch](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/992/) scratch an old but always hard-to-identify itch I've carried with me for more than a decade.

I'd always wished, with the games we'd gotten, that Capcom really tried to polish up whatever they'd made with a little more finesse and panache before shoveling six more sequels out the door - while I like the sheer quantity of games that we have in the aftermath of how Capcom operated, I would easily sacrifice Mega Man X6 and beyond if it meant that the dev time spent went towards a more finely-tuned X5. Instead of a well-done X5 with one extra year of development at the end of the PlayStation 1's life cycle, we got two half-baked sequels to drop the baton X4 carried across the span of two years. And instead of a well-baked Mega Man 3, to send the NES off with a bang and go out with style and respect, Capcom used the ensuing years to not only effectively scrape some needed polish off Mega Man 3, but waste the time between generations with three more sequels with dwindling public respect and sales.

Again, I appreciate the amount of games we're left with in hindsight, but, Mega Man would have been a much more colossal cultural milestone beyond just Mega Man 2 and Mega Man X1 if they'd slowed the output down *just a tad* and made the releases they did put out just a little more important. With Mega Man 3 in particular, with the amount of creative, unburdened ideas that they had - a new cool rival character in Proto Man, a new cool sidekick in Rush, new moves, new worlds (literally, going by the game's planet-hopping story), twice the length, more cinematics, cooler splash screens before and after each level - with just a few more months' worth of work, and, the fact that most trilogies come in threes, and the SNES was nearing its completion - *it would have made so much sense to put everything they had into properly finishing 3 and moving to the Sega Genesis and take their time on Mega Man 4 and 5*. I like Mega Man 6 but I would easily sacrifice it if it meant slowing down the dev time between 1990 and 1994 into keeping Mega Man healthy, relevant, and Triple AAA.

  
3 and 4 have always been my favorite entries on the NES but it always would have made more sense to change a thing or two about them for the better. Common consensus is that 3 was rushed and very good, but flawed, and the devs at Capcom always talk about 3 like there was so much they wanted to do but couldn't thanks to higher management insisting they push it out yesterday. Crack open the source code for Mega Man 3 and it shows - there's so much unused content just sitting there, languishing, small details and large that would have blown fans' minds back in 1990.

  
I've been largely aware of everything sitting in the MM3 source code, and how much of it is still there compared to the other NES MM games but - thanks to the improvement patch by [ROMHacking.net](http://ROMHacking.net) user kuja killer (as far as I am aware), I got to see it in working firsthand action for the first time today now that I'm a little more emulation-savvy and *wow* \- how freaking cool.

It feels infinitely better, like getting a gift you know you've wanted for a long time but it's so niche you frankly don't know how to communicate or ask for. 

[It utilises a planet background, and some parallax scrolling with it and the stars, that's still in the game's code in Gemini Man's stage. Later on, when you encounter Proto Man, there's another unused element in a small animation of Protoman transforming into Break Man in a split second before taking off and clearing your way. Watching it in action was so cool - it's botheringly already in the game, and it only would have taken an extra minute of development time that the devs didn't have, to implement it - it would have made a world of difference to kids in 1990 who are now lifelong fans today.](https://preview.redd.it/no2w7aw0v7be1.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3fe691f002c30f284c663d55337d973557e124e)

[Several glitches have been fixed - the cloud platforms in Snake Man's stage you stand on no longer are at risk of shunting you off to the side of the smokestack and killing you, making it a much easier experience, you feel more at ease and less paranoid. That's more fitting for an easy first-pick level! In Spark Man's stage, these unused spikes on the ceiling which I didn't even know about - but now that they're here, this game I've played start to finish over dozens of times now feels brand new. The changes are small, but numerous and unexpected, and it fills a certain void that you could argue is pointless but feels reinvigorating. I got to play my favorite classic Mega Man game in a brand new way.](https://preview.redd.it/pja249w0v7be1.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e962b0843b4a5784e94f264028e53a807ac13d3)

[The cutscenes are longer, better, and more numerous - there's a brand new opening cutscene, that cleverly repurposes Gamma's sprite into a neat screen-filling background element, every instance of \\""Dr. Right\\"" or \\""Wiley\\"" has been fixed, the cutscene before Wily's Castle is more interesting and uses the full song jingle \(which, fun fact, in the final game, you only get the first six seconds of\), and, in the ending frame, they threw in some birds flying behind the tree for good measure AND kept Protoman's whistle playing through the Robot Master roll call until the staff credits kick in. These subtle changes go a long way towards flavor and make you realize that MM3 was and is too enormous to be just the unimportant midpoint between MM1 and 6.](https://preview.redd.it/82piw8w0v7be1.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=193c73482afb7c470f19f1ba8ba776c3a9ab2d06)

https://preview.redd.it/07rnraw0v7be1.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=74107620dd8ccfc5e776b67cd62613ea5b7806e3

[Small areas like these - as well as the opening of Doc Robot Spark Man's stage, have been slightly modified so there's no possibility of you getting stuck if you're out of Rush Coil or Jet and you don't need to reset the game.](https://preview.redd.it/5zcd19w0v7be1.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a962a55df82b4c18a672460a187ce454d37b504)

And there were a billion other small changes I noticed too - Magnet Missile feels smoother, certain new sound effects were added for Proto Man, the swinging hammer Joes, the giant hornets in Hard Man's stage, the bullets and the pogo bouncers in Snake Man's stage, Air Man and Crash Man's fights; glitched out graphics were fixed, the Yellow Devil fight you can now slide under properly and without crossing your fingers and hoping for the best, the junk golems in Wily Stage 4 and the compactor crush blocks they throw (and the ones in Spark Man's stage) don't hit you weirdly, Wily Machine 3 now tunnels a bit into the ground with each step for a slightly more and slightly more appropriately difficult fight... the small touches really go an extra mile. 

  
If I could get someone who's skilled with an NES mod out there to add a last touch or two, I've always thought it would be cool and refreshing if the Doc Robot stages used a different color palette, for all the stages, and not just Needle Man's. Like Sonic Mania's Encore Mode. It would cut the tedium a little bit. And - purely for aesthetic touch - I would love the first five notes of Protoman's Whistle to play when you boot the game up at the copyright information. It'd be cool and let you know you're in for a real ride. 

I can't recommend it enough and I sure as hell won't be going back to base MM3 again now that I have this on my laptop. Between this and Sequel Wars, once that's finished, I'll finally be able to realize what I've always imagined, a world where Mega Man, instead of sputtering out on the last generation, going nowhere, kept up with the times and stayed the ever-relevant gaming icon that he was always supposed to be. Huge round of applause for everyone who worked on this."

**Story So Far:**

* *In a flashback scene, Ingrid learns about Rogue Rifts.*

\_\_\_

The elf sighed, wishing that Ingrid could take this more seriously. ""They're gold-ranks, Ingrid. They probably want us to hand over the Titan's remains and probably even our own familiars.""

""...and use their peerage as leverage."" Philia said ""We'll be making big enemies big time if we don't.""

""Those King Hawks are led by that falcon-folk Talarek of House Castor. He's heir to his father's Barony."" Khorak grunted, making a displeased crocodilian bellow in his throat.

Alster made adorable dog whimpers, worried about making enemies with powerful nobility. His team nervously huddled behind him. The Iron Stampede on the other hand, stood straighter, their expressions grim.

Zefir sighed, ""*I'll go polish the howitzer then...*""

""You do that, Baseplate."" Philia said, touching her earpiece, ""Outlaw, you might want to warm up the ATV, and prepare to bulldoze your way through hundreds of people and break through the gate.""

""*Understood, King Fish.*"" Gwen muttered, ""*It wouldn't be my first time.*""

Kinu and Kvaris looked at Philia but their expressions gave nothing away. The implications of that huge iron wagon trampling its way through a city full of people brought to mind quite a gory sight.

The Furies and Stampede looked up at her as well. It took them a few seconds to realize that she was talking to someone else.

""House Castor is at Orinn-Fadel's Eyrie at the Tower March."" Khorak added.

There was no flicker of emotion in Philia's eyes ""His father's friend to a Margrave?""

""Nominally, he's subordinate but they have connections."" Yakael cooed.

""English, Philia?"" Cecil asked, not familiar with the political hierarchy.

""A Margrave is someone who holds land at the border,"" Philia explained ""That makes them quite powerful because they control trade and defense.""

""Ah,"" said Ingrid, nodding thoughtfully ""Outsourced border patrol"" she added, chuckling.

""The Tower Marches are adjacent to Elion-Nosco."" Peanut squeaked, ""which makes them quite valuable to Veles.""

""If I remember my history right..."" Philia continued ""Orinn-Fadel was among the many tiny bits of land ceded from the Tower Marches, it ended a civil war, lords get their lands but in practice they're just autonomous bits still legally adhering to Tower Marches' state laws. In a manner of speaking.""

""So if we piss off Baron Castor, he can get the Margrave to cause us trouble?"" Cecil squeaked, though there was no worry in his voice.

""In theory...yes."" Philia said slowly. ""But you need to understand that these little baronies were ceded reluctantly, otherwise they would have willingly annexed themselves to Elion-Nosco. King Raldia spent quite a bit of gold wooing them over..."" the ex-princess paused a bit, mindful of keeping her identity hidden ""...as far as my contacts have told me.""

""On the other hand, if the Barony dissolves, I'm sure the Margrave would love to reward whomever contributed to that house's downfall"" the crocodile chuckled darkly.

""Talarek is heir-apparent."" Yakael added ""but word is his siblings are still vying for his seat.""

""He's the heir."" Kvaris remarked ""He should be reading books and learning this land's history, not swinging his weight around.""

""Oh don't look at us."" Kinu said quickly ""Once we do fifty years of adventuring, sister and I will take up the old coot's mantle.""

 

Ingrid chuckled as the two sisters referred to Freid's greatest soldier as an ""old coot.""

""Why do you call your old man an 'old coot?', from what I've heard he's the greatest warrior around.""

""Indeed."" Kvaris said factually ""He's probably still stronger thank you.""

""But he can be really whimsical."" Kinu added ""One time we went sailing to the Maelstrom Isles...""

At the mention of these islands, Ingrid and Cecil were surprised when everyone's ears perked up.

""What?"" Yakael half-yelled, ""You went there?!""

""We were only twelve then."" Kvaris sighed. ""Too young to see the Gold Chamberlain's face.""

""The Grim Reaper"" Philia explained to Cecil and Ingrid.

Even Siria was aghast at the idea of Amaduscia taking his two young children there.

""What are these 'Maelstrom' Isles?"" Ingrid asked, not understanding the significance.

""They're islands surrounded by a perpetual storm,"" Rhamad explained ""the waters are infested with waterspouts and whirlpools, it's virtually impossible to navigate to them.""

""There's only a few stretches of water that remains... normal."" Kairos added ""We call them the water-bridges of fate.""

""Because only fate will dictate if that stretch of water will 'hold' or collapse into a whirlpool."" the elf-archer girl said. ""That said, those islands are rich with valuable treasure in the form of rare stones and valuable plants that can only be found there.""

 

""Old coot it is."" Ingrid said, nodding solemnly. ""Alright, back on topic, just let me do the talking. If push comes to shove we..."" her lips curled into a smile then laughed. ""I'm sorry, Philia...what the hell? Barrel the ATV through the city streets?""

""It's a possibility,"" Philia said flatly ""the second junior there gets a boo-boo, he might accuse us of anything heinous.""

""Reasonable,"" Cecil declared ""We can play that game too! They got any nutcase groups at the Tower Marches or anything?""

""Yup,"" Philia replied ""let's just say that the Marches are in turn a collection of lands all swearing fealty to the Margrave, who in turn answers to the King. Some adjacent March lands to this day are still grumbling that the allotted territory towards those spoiled barons impinged on their own, so if you wanna do balaclava antics, there's only too many groups that would love to either play delivery boy or claim responsibility.""

""Wow."" Ingrid chuckled ""Isekai Terrorism anypercent speedrun. World Record.""

""Beat you to that, Ingrid."" Philia said ""I was eight when I brought down two-""

""WHOA! WHOA!! WHOA!"" interjected both Cecil and Ingrid, ""Let's not get too specific here! There are Americans here!""

Zefir was laughing.

“It was two bridges!” Philia protested.

""Were they suspension bridges?"" Cecil inquired, his eyes narrowing suspiciously.

""Well..."" Philia's voice trailed off, visibly uncomfortable.

“Bad!” Cecil exclaimed.

""Technically, I'm shy of two weeks old here, Philia."" Ingrid said.

“Terrorism?” Iohann asked, not familiar with the term.

“It means harming lots of people for a political or ideological motive.” Ingrid explained.

Siria's elf-like ears perked up. ""Isn't that every noble's hobby?"" she quipped.

""Ooooh!"" Cecil exclaimed, his slime body wriggling in mirth ""Sick burn!""

Ingrid and Philia began swatting at their bodies, as if their clothes had caught on fire as they comically feigned distress.

“Welp, that’s another item off of our bucket list.” Cecil squeaked “The asshole aristocrat encounter!”

“What?” Philia cried in mock dismay “What about me?”

“*You’re a terrorist.*” Zefir deadpanned “*All that money you’re sitting on is blood money, it doesn’t count.*”

Ingrid put a finger to her earpice, ""Starchaser Actual to Glados, advise all Ram Ranchers for a possible Code Exodus..."" she said, she motioning for everyone else to halt, then sauntered over to the group of Gold-Rankers eyeing them malicious. She waved to Cecil to accompany her.

""Let's get this shit over then."" Cecil smiled grimly.

 

The group of King Hawks were dressed in an ensemble that would make a peacock look modest. They were all bird-folk, their well-preened feathers shimmered in iridiscent hues, and their armor looked more suited for a royal wedding than a dungeon dive. The leader, a falcon, strutted forward with a smug look.

""Can I help you?"" Ingrid asked, stopping a few feet in front of the falcon man. ""In case you're thinking of it, nothing belonging to my team is for sale, nor are they to be given to anyone.""

""Not the carcass of the Lifebane Titan or all the monsters it had lying half-dead before we killed them all."" Cecil added.

""Neither are the mice, nor the Fae Marsh Hare. Nor am I."" Ingrid continued ""Ingrid Lily, by the way, I'm the leader of this team The Whales.""

The falcon tilted his head in the direction of Siria.

""Come here, Siria!"" He called, ""I don't have time to deal with your pet!""

Rather than respond, Siria briefly looked at the source of the sound before turning her eyes back to Khorak whom she had a little tête-à-tête with.

""I don't think he understood you, Ingrid."" Cecil said cutely, but his voice was dripping with sarcasm. ""I think you need to say it slower.""

""Hi...I'm...Ingrid."" She comically waved her arms for effect.

""And now we just wait, might take him half an hour to understand, you know, like that sloth at the DMV from Zootopia."" Cecil chuckled.

""You know... I've seen hours of Judy, but I've never watched the movie.""

""You need Jesus!"" Cecil exclaimed, backing away from her.

 

Talarek, the haughty falcon, glared both at them down. Whatever unknown language they were speaking was flawlessly captured by his Interpretation Spell, and despite some obscure references and odd terms like ""Dee-Emm-Vee"", he could tell he was being insulted.

""You!"" The falcon pointed his finger at Ingrid ""Get me your master! I shall discuss-""

""See?"" Cecil interrupted ""I told you it would take him a while to understand. His brain works slow.""

Ingrid couldn’t help but laugh. Talarek seethed as he belated realizedly that not only might the human be speaking the truth that she was indeed the team's leader; an absurd thought as it was, but that he had unwittingly cast himself as the ""slow-learning buffoon"" they had been mocking.

""Enough of you, slime!"" Talarek retorted, there was a flicker of worry in his eyes. This Cecil not only was talking but had no core. His beady eyes looked back at his without any regard to peerage and the portal he resided in, led back to an opulent room patio far more regal than his own. He wondered if this slime was already the familiar of some greater noble and considered if he should reconsider his approach.

""I'd be careful..."" Ingrid warned him calmly. ""Last I heard, making an Elder Slime angry isn't exactly good for your health.""

""Gotta work on that roll and parry time."" Cecil joked cryptically.

""This is Cecil,"" Ingrid introduced ""He's my number two-""

""The number two's in front of you."" Cecil quipped, causing Ingrid and Philia to lose composure, turning away briefly to laugh.

Talarek's feathers bristled, there was something more to that underhanded insult but he couldn't put a finger to it. Something about it that made it more grating than simply being called second-class that made two of their number laugh too much.

""Cecil...Cecil, please..."" Ingrid wheezed as the slime had that smug self-satisfied grin. ""Anyway..."" the girl composed herself. As I said, I'm Ingrid, I lead the Whales. Siria isn't my master. Those fine folks travelling with us are The Iron Stampede, and The Green Furies... now I'm told you're Lord-""

""Number four, Chicken Wonton with extra Sichuan sauce!"" Cecil called out in some kind of accent, followed by playing a sound clip of a brass gong from his Muse Box.

Ingrid and Philia really lost it this time, bursting out in laughter.

A crowd had gathered around them now, drawn by the commotion. They were openly chuckling at the sight of the flustered Gold-Rankers. While they had no better understanding of the source of the slime and human's humor, it didn't matter; the fact that a noble, someone who should be well-read and better enlightened was struck clueless painted him as not only the butt of their joke but also their intellectual inferior.

 

""Enough!"" Talarek yelled, wincing as he realized that since he had made the first outburst, he now was on the losing end of the dignity stick. He took a deep breath, trying to compose himself. ""I am Lord Talarek, heir-apparent of House Castor, and I demand to speak with the leader of this...paltry team!""

""See?"" Cecil smirked. ""Give it a while."" He turned around to address the spider-bot ""Neith! How long ago did Ingrid say she was the leader?""

""Replaying."" The spider-bot replied, before playing back the sound clip.

""The statement ‘*Ingrid Lily, by the way, I'm the leader of this team, The Whales.*' Was mentioned...**one-minute... and... forty....seconds...** ago."" Many either jumped in surprise or did a double-take as the ""spider golem"" perfectly imitated Ingrid's voice.

Ingrid, Philia, Cecil, and Zefir were snickering as Neith recited the timestamp. There just was something funny with the way Neith was talking normally, only to use an overly synthesized voice for the numbers.

 

Back in Autumhollow, Zefir was laughing up a storm.

""Oh god, I hope to never hear that voice again."" Zefir said, in complete stitches. ""I am in hell!""

Gwen tilted her head curiously, her cat ears twitching. ""Why is that?""

""Back on Earth, you can use a telephone to speak with businesses to provide you with assistance. Some guilds however can have many customers...in the hundreds of thousands."" Philia explained. ""They use primitive thinking machines like Glados to organize the concerns of their customers into a queue.""

""*Ooooh.*"" Viel said ""*I get it now, so Baseplate is being horribly reminded of having to wait in line.*""

""*Very long lines!*"" Sammy giggled.

 

""One minute and forty seconds!"" Cecil exclaimed, ""I told you he's slow!""

And now some of the crowd were openly guffawing at Talarek's expense.

""Don't be a fool!"" Talarek snapped, ""No one would ever believe that.""

""Careful, Talarek."" Ingrid narrowed her eyes, her grin wide as ever as she tapped the guild badge on her scarf ""You are leveling serious allegations against the Fenrir.""

The crowd murmured amongst themselves, the human had a point, questioning a badge was questioning the guilds authority.

""Also,"" Ingrid added ""You are questioning the City Guard of Teth-Odin, they let me in here, does your daddy have enough clout to throw dirt at this city? You see, last I checked, Teth-Odin's contribution to Veles' economy is the dungeon, meanwhile your place exports-""

""Avian flu."" Cecil quickly filled in.

Talarek squawked in anger as whatever this insufferable slime said made the human dissolve into another giggling fit, which in turn made everyone else laugh even harder.

 

""Avian flu?"" Viel asked.

""One time ago, many birds on Earth, ones for consumption, had been struck with a plague that rendered them unfit for eating. They were all culled."" Neith explained, her voice a monotone contrast to the laughter around her. ""Cecil is comparing Talarek to diseased poultry.""

 

""Alright..."" Ingrid said, taking a deep breath. ""So what do you want?""

""I came to relieve your team of those squandered resources."" Talarek growled, pointing at the mice ""An insolent animal like you, pretending to be people deserves to be flogged to learn your place! We will be taking the Titan's remains, and your familiars, as reparations for your disrespect.""

""Pika-choo!"" Cecil squeaked cutely.

There was an audible cascade of metallic clicks as all the mice disengaged the safety catch of their guns. Cuddly, in the middle of eating a carrot, ""ermm'd"" in agitation, biting the root crop in half with a loud crunching sound, before jumping out of the elf archer's arms to stand next to the mice. Johnny croaked and wriggled his way to the front lines as well, ready for a fight.

Seeing the mice quietly form a half-circle behind her, Ingrid raised her hands in a motion for calm, before turning back to Talarek.

 

""Easy now, Team Rocket, before you go blasting off. If you're just looking for more familiars, I'm sure there's a lot of third-world countries you can get gophers from, have you tried the back of your crack house at... where you live again?""

""Podunk, Squawikstan."" Cecil replied.

“R-right… Podunk Squawkistan, lovely place, I-PPPPFFTTT!” Ingrid’s suddenly broke cackling.

Talarek's plumage bristled in displeasure, he was prepared to be rejected with either a defiant ""no"" accompanied by some crass remarks in order to boost their bravado. The two were annoyingly sophisticated. Anger welled up in him, but he could find no riposte.

While still cackling, Cecil pressed on.

""Have you tried recruiting the cokehead pigeons across the street from where you live?"" the slime suggested, ""...they haven't flapped a wing yet and they're already high."" 

Ingrid was sounding like a goose having an aneurysm.

""Enough of your jests, you damned slime!"" the falcon snarled. His intuition told him they were insulting his homeland and his people, though exactly what sort of caricature he was drawing in his mind was unknown. The human's constant braying in mirth however, suggested it was extremely degrading.

""I'm serious!"" Cecil protested ""What about all those big raven-folk lining up at your mom's-""

Ingrid was slapping her knee, doubled over in laughter. ""Cecil!"" she choked out.

Talarek's feathers turned a darker shade of red as the crowd's amusement grew, turning his embarrassment into rage.

The human was humbly holding up a hand as she composed herself, signalling she wanted to speak.

""I'm sorry..."" There was a hint of contrition in her voice ""But we're not giving you anything. Not the familiars nor the Titan, nor the prestige that goes with killing the Titan. You want glory and prestige? You get in line with everyone else, and go into the Rogue Rift. Shouldn't be a problem since you look like Gold-Ranks.""

“They’re wasted on you and our ilk!” Talarek yelled indignantly, ""with those in my possession. I bring glory to my noble house. To my noble lands. They're wasted on you, you...people."" he sneered, looking down on them, his feathers ruffling in contempt ""You're just fighting for gold, you don't have a sense of honor. The guilds let you operate untouched because-""

""OH MY GOD HERE COMES THE BORING POLITICS!"" Cecil yelled ""Don't give me that crap, Talarek! You just want henchmen to fight your wars, and you want a stuffed Titan to scare off the rest of Veles!""

""You mean Elion-Nosco."" Ingrid frowned.

""Awww bullshit!"" Cecil squeaked ""He wants to posture and get more Lebensraum from the Margrave or else he'll defect to Elion-Nosco, that's why he wants bargaining chips!""

Ingrid's eyes narrowed ""That's treason, My Lord.""

 

Talarek swallowed nervously, several unfriendly gazes were being leveled at him. The human was right, he had phrased his intentions poorly, if it wasn’t for their damned buffoonery at his expense that got him all riled up! But an accusation this grave cuts both ways…

""Falsely accusing your betters is a serious crime, human."" Talarek glowered indignantly. ""To say nothing about not paying proper respect to a duly appointed Lord.""

Ingrid stepped closer, though neither her tone nor her posture was threatening. Her hands remained on her hips.

""Sir, I'm from North Carolina, the twelfth of the United States of America."" Ingrid said, her tone subconsciously sinking deeper and deeper into her native Southern Drawl ""Where we're from, we don't observe the kind of hierarchy based on 'Because I Say So' logic such as ones held by Kings, Lords, or Saints. In our country, we only respect power that's earned by-""

 

Philia, Cecil, and Zefir were having a giggling fit as Ingrid's acquired neutral accent dipped deep into Banjo Country, although her vocabulary mercifully stood its ground. The situation grew more absurd when Neith began tormenting the earthlings by playing on her speakers a brass band rendition of ""The Star Spangled Banner"". To add more fuel to the fire, the spider-bot activated a telescoping flagpole and flew the Stars and Stripes.

At the first notes of the national anthem and the sound of hydraulics from Neith's telescoping flagpole, the mice squeaked loudly and stamped their feet, snappily turning to face the flag and salute, forcing Philia to scrunch up her face and try to hold in a burst of laughter as she did the same, her shoulders shaking in mirth as the mice loudly began to squeak ""The Star Spangled Banner"" along with the music, which was also contributing to Cecil, and Zefir's rapidly wavering composure. The sight alone would have been adorable, touching even. 

""...so, I understand where you're coming from, Sir. Wanting to stand up for your people and all that,"" Ingrid continued, her North Carolina accent heavy with emotion. ""But let me tell you something. Where I'm from, it doesn't matter where you're from. Those who shed their blood in service of our country are heroes loved and respected by all. So don't tell me what just because we're outlanders we don't have a voice here. We've shed our blood and laid our lives and by God, I will not let you take that away from me or any of us. Our sweat and tears have sanctified this place, and the fruits of our labor will not adorn the altar of your ego. Why, just a few days ago I lit the funeral pyres of brave men who sacrificed themselves in this very dungeon. They may not have been born here in Teth-Odin, or Veles, but they deserve statues, not you, who have-""

Peanut started weeping quietly as Ingrid made a defiant speech in honor of her fallen teammates, before Philia pulled her in for a hug with her free arm. The little mushroom blubbered and cried out on her shoulder, something that helped anchor Philia's composure amidst the absurdity of the situation. The onlookers saw the tears fall out of Philia's eyes and her utterly red face (from trying not to laugh), and averted their gaze respectfully.

""D-dammit, Neith!"" Philia hissed violently.

""AMERICA!"" Neith yelled, waving the flagpole, making the mice squeak to the anthem only louder, causing Philia, Cecil, and Zefir to snort.

 

""...and my great-grandfather, Patrick Blair fought on the beaches of Omaha, the man wouldn't die, a hundred wounds pierced body, but God the man did not die! Not until every single one of those Nazi nests were rooted out with fire and lead! He died on his feet after the last gunshot was fired on that blood-soaked sand. He wasn't no Duke, nor was he a knight, but his country gave him a home, a place to raise his family, so when the time came that America was looking for volunteers, volunteers to fight a war half a world away to save not his own people, but foreigner we called friends, he answered the call! And all for what? For the thankless masses, but we're Americans, goddamnit! And we will spill our blood just so our own people back at home can be so carefree to think like that! It was only-""

Ingrid was lost in the moment, ironically not seeing the banner fluttering in the dungeon breeze, still engrossed in her vitrioloic manifesto. The earthling's obscure humor that once made a fool of the bird-folk and his feather cohorts now having spectacularly backfired on them as they valiantly fought to keep themselves from laughing and represent their country, their world, with all due dignity.

Talarek's lackeys, who couldn't muster the wits to help their master now, wisely kept their mouths shut. They had nothing to offer, nothing to refute this humans' speech. The Drow Solenrala wrapped around her body must have been earned at such a heavy price. It alone held their tongues for they had no visible marks of valor like she did. Ever elf present at this point, now glared at their team with searing reproach. At this point, the King Hawks weren't just disrespecting Ingrid, but disrespecting their sacred garb.

 

""...and though I may no longer be able to return to my homeland,"" Ingrid continued, raising her fist in the air as she gazed up at the darkened ceiling above, ""...by the grace of God, I will uphold her ideals. I offered my life once to the Red, White, and Blue, and by God, I am not afraid to bleed on those stripes to keep them red! I don't need no pedigree, nor appointment by no King to defend that land of mine that nurtured countless dreams, for every one that-""

Cecil's slime body was jiggling uncontrollably as he tried his hardest not to laugh, his tendril shaking as he continued to hold the salute, the whimpers and whining sounds he made made the now-concerned King Hawks turn their eyes in shame as they mistook his valiant attempt to corral his mirth with patriotic fervor and respect for the fallen brave. The human continued to speak proudly of being a citizen to a land where people put fanatic templar orders to shame as they gave their lives without a second thought. All Cecil was thinking however, was how funny the mice were sounding squeaking along to the tune.

 

""A land of the truly free, dammit! Where every man, woman, and child can say 'Get off my lawn!' to anyone they choose, to walk their streets without bowing their head to anyone but God Almighty himself! We may not like each other at times, but God as my witness, we're all Americans! And I will fight to the death to keep your freedom to tell me to fuck off! I-""

The King Hawks looked at each other, utterly flabbergasted at the human's vitriolic rant. It was clear she wasn't going to be swayed by their noble titles.

Some in the gathered crowd were sniffling, some sobbing as Ingrid’s stirring words brought memories of fallen friends. Rivalries were put aside, grudges were set down. In the end, they all bled here, they all lost someone here, everyone at some point in their history here in Teth-Odin was saved because of someone’s sacrifice.

 

""...and that's what America's all about! Personally I could care less if you want a curtsy your way, but I too have an obligation! An obligation to my parents, and their parents, and their grandparents, stretching back to when the first settlers thanked God for guiding their ships to that land of freedom. How can I call myself their daughter, the blood they've spilled on my behalf all wasted just so I could bow down to you? God did not put a fire in me to burn incense, but light the torches of Liberty!"" Ingrid finished, her cheeks a bit flushed with passion.

""Can I get an Amen!?"" Neith yelled.

 

As she spoke that last part, the mice squeaked the final part ""For the Land of the Free, and the Hooooome ooooof, the Braaaaaaave!"" extra loud with cute mousy squeaks that pushed the earthlings except for Ingrid even closer to the threshold. On cue, Viel's firebirds did a fly-by on Neith's request. The cat girl had no idea why, but saw no harm in doing so. A sight that only added to the absurdity and pushed Philia and Cecil closer to breaking out in laughter.

There was an awkward silence, the mirth of the two reincarnators totally lost to her. Ingrid's features softened and she patted the slime affectionately. Mistaking his effort to contain mirth for an attempt to hold back tears.

""Thanks Cecil."" Ingrid said, touched that even an otherworlder slime considered her former homeworld his own.

""N-no p-problem..."" The slime said, his voice wavering as he tried to keep face. He quickly shot up high into the ceiling, before bolting to his room to finally laugh.

“You should be ashamed of yourselves!” Ingrid glared at the King Hawks, jabbing her finger in the air at them.

Philia had it worst. She had nowhere to let it out.

\_\_\_

Following Ingrid's speech, the mob assembled had angrily called for the departure of the King Hawks. Numerous adventurers present were outsiders themselves, which led them to empathize with Ingrid's firm stance to behave as a citizen of her homeland, and touched by her love for her country. Concurring without question, they deemed that the King Hawks had overstepped their bounds and acted dishonorably. The Gold-Rankers quickly slinked away in disgrace, knowing they could not enact any retaliation on the Whales. Their word may have weight but so did the words of many who watched.

The following day, an announcement was posted on the Liaison Office's board and soon a sworn written statement from several witnesses regarding the dishonorable behavior of Talarek and his men was circulated throughout the guilds. 

But that is a story for another time…

 

Meanwhile, Ingrid and Cecil had received an astounding standing ovation from the gathered adventurers. When the audience had gathered around to witness the altercation, they saw the human; who looked like a Nemesis-Stalker dressed as a killer drow, and her slime companion; who could only be the larva of an Elder Slime. They all had believed that all it would take for the confrontation to escalate into an orgy of violence was a few choice words from the arrogant Lord of Castor.

In hindsight, even if the confrontation led to violence, Siria could not be held at fault for the pair's actions. The fact that the Nemesis-Stalker donned a Drow Solenrala, an esteemed garb under Siria's own tutelage, was a testament to the human's exceptional skill. Similarly, the Elder Slime larva's ability to cast and maintain a spell as advanced as the flying portal coupled with its unexpectedly sharp wit, suggested an intellect adept at deploying its magical abilities in deadly and unforeseen ways. Therefore, Talarek's choice to further antagonize two extremely dangerous entities was universally regarded as an act of utter stupidity.

The most astonishing aspect of the entire event was that the only thing eviscerated was Talarek's pride. The irony of mere ""animals"" verbally besting a nobleman; who should've had the high ground on matters of wit and intellect, was not lost on the crowd. Finally, Ingrid's impassioned speech had brought the house down, and she wasn't even aiming to denounce Talarek's noble origins but rather, bring to light the absurdity of his greed and entitlement, and the collective valor of the common folk as well as their sacrifices that allowed him to live so high and mighty. It was a declamation that resonated deeply within the hearts of all present, and the echo of it washed over the dungeon like a wave of righteous indignation.

The crowd had watched as Talarek's expressions went from shock, to indignation, to fury, and then a profound shame as Ingrid's words hit him harder than any sword could. It was the cherry atop the slice of humble pie, much to the audience's delight.

\_\_\_

""Last time I heard anyone talk that much..."" Rhamad murmured to Khorak ""It was some perfumed noble with a mouth full of hot air.""

""Indeed,"" Khorak chuckled quietly. ""Instead, our good Ingrid brought forth real fire, not pathetic puffs of wind. Last time words stirred my heart so much was from an Enhancement Spell, not a speech.""

""I wonder where this country of Ingrid is located..."" Yakael mused, ""Seems like it would make for an interesting journey.""

""Don't bet on it."" Kairos sighed ""Philia mentioned they were forcibly teleported here by some cone hat magic, I doubt we'll be seeing it anytime soon...""

 

Meanwhile the Green Furies were also excitedly chattering amongst themselves.

""Never judge a book by its cover..."" The elf girl, Lila giggled ""To think such stuck-up nobles would be humbled in their own demesne of words, by the likes of Ingrid and Cecil...""

""I can see why Siria has such deference for her..."" Alster said, ""... I've never heard such learned speech from a human. Makes you wonder what else is out here in this world that can surprise us.""

""Did you notice the mice though?"" The young Sorian, Lenar whispered. ""They looked like they were ready to fight, even though none of the Whales commanded anything... I've never seen Tixi Mice do that except to protect their own.""

 

On the other hand, Kvaris lightly elbowed Philia.

""Spill it..."" she whispered. ""What was so funny? Ingrid's words were... powerful. Moving, even.""

Fortunately, Ingrid wasn't nearby to hear Philia and Cecil give a breakdown of all the jokes that flew under everyone's radar, as the three teams made their way to the Titan Cage, the Starchaser was deluged by the crowd, congratulating her as if she was running for president.

""Ingrid for President!"" Neith cried, waving the flag. Her laser-guided precision joke once again caused the earthlings (except Ingrid who didn't hear it) to laugh, especially when she started playing ""Yankee Doodle"" which made the mice march in step.

\_\_\_

The Titan Cage had been transformed into a war camp, several rows of tents and campfires stood in neat rows. The air rang with the hammers of smiths forging, repairing, and imbuing weapons and armor. Gone was the ostentatious posturing of adventurers trying to puff themselves up. Or at the very least, the paradigm had shifted. A burly minotaur took off his tunic and flexed his muscles reassuringly before a team of novices, his hide looking too tough to be scratched by even the sharpest teeth and claws of any known monster. A paladin swung his surfboard-sized sword, filling all viewers with confidence that no monster carapace could ever hope to stand against such divine might. Orc warriors painted their faces in a ferocious visage, causing many onlookers to subconsciously stand tall and grind their fears beneath their boots. Kobold veterans were huddled around by others as they discussed tactics and strategy. The war camp looked like an army without a general, a confederation of the willing, united by the promise of glory, wealth, and the thrill of the fight.

Some had grouped themselves to stand guard at the various entrances of the Titan cages, barricades of all sorts of materials, either conjured from their spells such as boulders or ice, or brought in from their item boxes, denied entry to any groups of monsters that might've come in to investigate the sudden intrusion of light and sound.

Others used this as an opportunity to make a good amount of coin; instead of coming there to tackle the rift, some had made themselves useful by using their magic to create various sources of illumination, they were either paid in gold, or in kind by giving them food and rejuvenation potions.

One team set up a soup kitchen, using the monsters hunted down recently as ingredients. Healers from the churches above had also set up shop. Now that they were protected by many; the wounded, envenomed, and cursed now had a quick route for healing, not just from the expedition from the Rogue Rift but also from within the rest of the dungeon itself.

 

The Whales, Iron Stampede, and Green Furies had gathered around a fire, still chuckling out the last of their mirth as Ingrid finally rejoined them, Cecil, Philia, Neith, and Zefir through the spider-bot’s speakers had just finished breaking down the last of the comedic nuances when she had returned.

""I got word from those who've already ventured into the rift..."" Ingrid began before sighing ""Clairvoyants and auguries suggest over five-hundred clusters.""

Rhamad clucked his tongue, shaking his head.

""the area extends over a hundred miles."" Ingrid continued, there people posted in the first ten to watch over the clusters. They will be collapsed last for obvious reasons. For us Whales, we'll be heading to the straight South where they've pinpointed the largest cluster.""

""What kind of resistance are we looking at?"" Cecil asked.

""Target saturated."" Ingrid replied ""from what I can gather, there's herds of herbivores, which in turn are preyed on by all sorts of predators. We'll have to assume the herbivores can get territorial and act aggressively. The plant life is growing like crazy, which brings in all sorts of browsers and grazers to feast on them, which in turn gets predators coming over to prey on them...""

""Which means..."" Kvaris said ""...the only winners are the plants because no matter who dies, it's all nourishment for them.""

""It's like the effects of the Red Moon have manifested on that world as well."" Lila remarked.

""There's too many of them to be taken out in one day, much less a week."" Khorak croaked ""But at the very least we've prevented their number from pouring into our world.""

""I suppose at this point, the best we can do is just hunt what monsters we can until the Jormungandr bring in their own Gold-Ranks to shut the portal for good."" Alster whined.

""*Why not use the howitzer?*"" Zefir suggested.

""Give me a cost-benefit analysis, Neith."" Philia said.

Neith ran a few simulations in her system. ""Cost ineffective. Best used for taking out wholesale biological targets. If you're thinking of using nuclear shells, you're out of luck. You will have no means to Item Box them.""

""What's a noo-clear shell?"" Kairos asked.

""It tears apart the fabric of creation."" Philia said, simplifying it for them ""A tiny tear could cause a great amount of destruction before the fabric of reality mends itself, even then, the area of effect will be cursed for years...""

Rhamad snorted ""Sounds a little too cone hat to use.""

""Agreed,"" Ingrid shrugged, ""not advisable to carcasses you want to Item Box.""

""What about the short-acting nerve gases?"" Cecil suggested.

Philia shook her head ""that still could take a good hour or two, by that time it could waft into people's noses, not an option.""

""WMD's are out."" Ingrid declared firmly ""We're not bringing out the howitzer.""

""What if I just fly out there?"" Cecil asked

""Too dangerous, we don't know the extent of your barrier."" Ingrid said, ""and if something does get through, I may not be able to recall you in time.""

""The old ways then..."" Philia mused.

""Green Fury,"" Ingrid said, ""It's time you guys form a coalition with others now, look out for each other, and keep your wits about you. This won't be a battleground, this is a siege.""

The novice team nodded, and then went off to network with the others. The Iron Stampede finished off their wine before they too rose to their feet.

""It's time for us to do our own Titan-hunting."" Khorak throatily announced, and then his team too faded into the crowd.

Ingrid waved to them, then checked her watch. There should still be plenty of sunlight left.

""Let's go."" She said, standing up ""Let's see if we can finish by dinner.""

- some Radeon RX 6600 8 GB just for display.

I'm running some docker containers in there (Seafile, WikiJS, Plex, qbitorrent and a VPN, some *arrs, etc.), but those use maybe 5-10% of the CPU's power.

&nbsp;


Six months had sharpened the New Rogues into a well-oiled machine, disrupting the Network’s operations wherever they could. The Network operated with the mission of holding criminals to a strict code. But it also kept the criminal element alive, ensuring the cities would never know safety. Together, William, Zack, Donald and Grace had targeted Network infrastructure and operations alike, along the way slowly garnering a reputation in the cities they served. The newest heroes on the block. But tonight was different. Tonight, they faced a new threat - Rubble and Rumble, a metahuman duo that had quite literally sent tremors through the heart of Central City. With their high and rapidly growing amount of collateral damage, the pair were sure to attract the Network’s enforcers attention. That meant the New Rogues had something to prove. If they could stop this rampage, they dealt a blow to any pretense of a positive reputation the Network had. They could prove the Network wasn’t needed.

William, suited up in silver, surveyed the scene with a hawk's eye. Rubble, a golem-like creature, towered over the panicked crowd, his body a chaotic assemblage of asphalt and concrete. Beside him, Rumble, an unassuming figure whose slight stature belied the catastrophic power at his fingertips, sent shockwaves rippling through the ground.

Zachary Snart, or Captain Cold, was first to charge in, first in the play they had made. With a swift motion, he unleashed a torrent of icy air, the temperature plummeting around Rubble. The golem's movements became sluggish, its rocky limbs encased in layers of frost.

A beat later, Donald, or Heat Wave, joined the fray, his hands glowing with an intense, fiery orange. He aimed at the ground around Rumble, superheating the air. Rumble staggered, overwhelmed by the sudden shift in temperature.

“Wizard, now!” William directed, his eyes never leaving the rampaging duo.

Grace - the Weather Wizard - extended her arms, and the sky above answered her call. Dark clouds converged, a storm brewing at her command. With a dramatic sweep of her arms, she directed a focused blast of wind, catching Rubble off-balance. The golem creature stumbled, his colossal mass making it very difficult to resist the allure of gravity’s pull. Not only that, with his joints brittle from the cold, he was almost paralysed, causing him to crash limply into the ground below.

William felt a surge of adrenaline as he watched his team work together seamlessly. Now, it was his turn. Zooming forward with a burst of speed that left a trail of silver and red, he circled the villains, creating a vortex that amplified the effects of his teammates' powers. Grace’s rip roaring gales, and Donald and Zack’s respective hot and cold fronts combined with William’s speed to shape the rapidly forming tornado. With practiced precision, William created a column of air pressure up in the air, one that quickly resolved to pin both superpowered rampagers to the ground. 

William then stepped back and - at breakneck pace - zoomed in and slipped handcuffs around them both. Superpower-dampening handcuffs appropriated from the Network’s recently-burgled storehouse.

As the dust settled and the threats were neutralised, the crowd erupted into thankful cheers and applause. The New Rogues stood together, their expressions a mix of relief and pride. They were more than a team; they were a force of nature, new guardians of the Twin Cities who had risen from the ashes of their troubled pasts.

William couldn't help but feel a swell of pride. Here, in this moment, they were not just celebrated as heroes - they were heroes, validated by the cheers of the people they had sworn to protect. The applause was loud, genuine, and for William, it was a confirmation that they were on the right path: the path of righteousness, and the ultimate defeat of the Reverse Flash.

The room in the Speed Force Institute was softly lit, the gentle hum of medical equipment filling the space with a quiet anticipation. Patty, holding Barry’s hand tightly, watched the monitor as Dr McGee manoeuvred the ultrasound probe.

“There, do you see? Your baby is completely healthy,” Dr McGee announced with a warm smile, pointing at the flickering image on the screen.

Barry, usually so quick to smile, felt a surge of relief mixed with awe. “That's our kid, Patty... perfectly healthy.”

Patty squeezed his hand, her eyes misting over with joy. “We're really doing this, Barry.”

Tina McGee was the gift that kept on giving. The Speed Force specialist was the obvious choice for Patty’s prenatal care, coupled with a number of other experts she kept as close contacts. This allowed them someone who knew both parents’ double identities and their unique physiologies. And so, with Tina’s latest bespoke battery of tests complete, she sent them on their merry way. 

As they both trundled out of Tina’s office, Patty clutched the printed image she had been given to her chest. She then watched as Barry’s gaze drifted, his smile fading into a line of concern.

“Barry, what's wrong? It’s all good news, isn’t it?”

He sighed, his voice low. “I just... can't shake it off. The city’s celebrating the Rogues as heroes. It's like everyone's forgotten where they came from.”

Patty understood his turmoil but wished he could have put those thoughts aside. Especially today. “Barry… Look, do you really think these new Rogues are the same kind of threat?”

His jaw tightened. “Yes, I do. And it worries me that William's with them.”

Patty nodded. Neither of them had seen William in months. “You know Wally's been trying his hardest to find him, to talk some sense into him.”

Barry's expression hardened. “I don’t want to hear about Wally, not after everything.” Barry hadn’t spoken to Wally in almost as long as had to William.

“But he’s trying, Barry. He’s also torn about the future, about what he knows. It’s not easy for him either,” Patty reasoned firmly.

Barry shook his head, frustrated. “How can you defend him? He knows so much more about the Reverse Flash that he let on. He might know who he is, but keeps it to himself. Doesn’t that bother you?""

Patty met his gaze steadily. “You know why though, Barry. It’s the same reason you won’t travel to the future to see how things play out for yourself, even though you can.”

Barry paused, the conflict evident in his eyes. “I get it, I do... But it doesn't make it any less messed up.”

The conversation shifted as Patty gently asked, “Do you still think Hunter Zolomon is the Reverse Flash?”

Barry hesitated, his answer slow and uncertain. “It could be anyone. That’s what scares me the most.”

The room fell silent, the weight of their conversation lingering between them until Barry’s phone rang, slicing through the tension. He answered quickly, his voice bright as he greeted the caller. After hanging up, he turned to Patty, not looking too concerned.

“What was that?” Patty asked, raising an eyebrow.

“We’re late for lunch,” Barry replied, the light-hearted remark a stark contrast to the gravity of their exchange just before.

Patty chuckled, standing up and pulling Barry to his feet. “Then let’s not keep him waiting; we’re celebrating. We can handle one crisis at a time, right?”

**2463. “The Future”.**

&nbsp;


Chaos unfurled in Gem City like a twisted circus act under the eerie glow of neon lights. Abra Kadabra, the suddenly-appearing sorcerer from an even further-flung future, conducted a symphony of destruction, animating the inanimate with a flourish of his blue-glowing wand. Cars roared to life, engines screeching as they lunged like feral beasts; light lamps swirled, forming a menacing gauntlet; dumpsters clanged and clattered, hurling debris with lethal precision.

Amid this maelstrom, Jai Kamath, newly christened with the powers of a speedster and clad in blood orange heroic garb, darted and dodged with frantic energy. His heart raced not just from exertion but from the adrenaline of facing such an unpredictable foe.

*“Jai, remember, your speed is about more than moving fast. It's about thinking fast,”* Professor Thawne buzzed through Jai’s comms.

*“I'm trying, Professor, but he's turning everything into a weapon!”* Jai shouted back, barely dodging a car spoiler that whizzed past his head like a thrown axe. “And it’s hard to stay in a straight line at these speeds, nevermind take corners!”

Abra Kadabra, reveling in the chaos, twirled his wand theatrically. His words boomed, projected by the same wonders that made all of his abilities possible. “Ah, isn’t this fun? You know, I chose this era because it was a Flash-free zone. I must admit, I was a bit nervous when you showed up, kid, but not anymore!”

Jai attempted another manoeuvre, zipping forward to disrupt Kadabra’s concentration. He remembered Thawne's advice about thinking fast, and poured through all he had studied about speedsters of the past before happening upon just the thing to try. Jai changed tracks, moving into rapid revolutions around a set point - running in circles - to create a vortex that would suck in the animated objects and neutralise the threat. Yet, his inexperience showed; the cyclone faltered, dissipating before it could grow strong enough.

Kadabra laughed, a sound that chilled Jai to the bone. “Oh, you are out of your depth, speed freak! Watch a real master at work.” With a grandiose gesture, he directed a swarm of neon fixtures to bend and weave like serpents, aiming straight for Jai.

Panic flared in Jai's chest as he sped away, the glowing snakes hissing air as they struck where he had been moments before. “Thawne, it’s not working! I’m not fast enough!”

*“Focus, Jai! Visualise your path. Or, or… harness the Speed Force in quick surges,”* Thawne instructed, his demeanour cool despite his stumbles for a next play. *“You don’t need to break into an all-out sprint, not if you can’t control it!”*

But then Kadabra unleashed his final gambit. A monstrous amalgam of cars and walls stripped from their very buildings merged into a towering behemoth that stomped towards Jai, each step a thunderclap on the ground below. All Jai could be thankful for was how little foot traffic there was down here after the rise of flying cars.

“Looks like this is the final curtain,” Kadabra crowed, watching his creature bear clunk closer to the fledgling speedster. “Stop this thing, or it’ll tear this city apart panel by panel!”

Jai's heart pounded as he faced the approaching colossus, the reality of his situation sinking in. He wasn't ready to be this era’s Flash, not yet. But he wasn't ready to give up either. As the shadow of the behemoth loomed over him, Jai braced for impact, determined to stand his ground.

Barry pulled the car to a gentle stop in front of their house, the engine quieting as he and Patty stepped out into the crisp air of their suburban neighborhood. As they walked towards the front door, a figure paced impatiently on their porch - Bart Allen, their teenage grandson from the future, waiting with the boundless energy of youth.[¹](/r/DCNext/comments/1dmyd2k/the_new_titans_10_if_i_had_my_time_again/)

“Why didn’t you just run here?” Bart asked, teasing them.

Patty smiled, “Well, ever since I found out I was pregnant - and all these hormones - well, my powers haven't been working as usual exactly. Or at all.”

“Probably a good thing,” Bart chuckled. “Wouldn’t want the baby getting whiplash, would ya?”

Barry fumbled for his keys, a small laugh escaping him as he unlocked the door. As he pushed it open, he turned to Bart. “Is it strange seeing your grandma like this? Pregnant with your dad?”

Bart’s smile faltered just for a moment, masked quickly by humour. “Oh yeah, for sure, it’s a total mode. It's like something out of a weird sci-fi show.”

They stepped inside, and Bart took a deep breath, anticipating the aroma of a home-cooked meal, only to find the air disappointingly clear. “Which one of you cooked?” he joked, looking across the living room and into the empty kitchen.

Barry and Patty exchanged a glance, then mirth spread across both of their faces. “Looks like we both forgot,” Barry admitted.

Bart sighed theatrically, shaking his head. “Guess I’ll grab some takeout then.” Without another word, he zipped away in a blur of motion.

Left in the sudden quiet, Patty’s expression sobered. “Barry, do you ever wonder if we should be spending so much time with Bart? What if it affects the timeline?”

Barry's reply came with a hint of sarcasm, “Well, Wally hasn’t stormed in to stop us, so it must be fine.” He leaned against the counter, a playful smile on his lips. “Bart's been all over time, trained with every Flash there is - or will be - before getting to me. *To us.* If it were a problem, I think we’d know by now.""

Patty nodded, but her eyes betrayed something else. “It’s just hard, sometimes, looking him in the eye... knowing what happens when he grows up.”

Barry's demeanour shifted, his voice dropping. “You mean when he trades his life for mine in 2019.”

Patty nodded, the weight of the future pressing down on her. “Yes. And we can’t say anything about it. Actually, reminds me of—”

Before Barry could respond and shut her down, a gust of wind announced Bart’s return, his arms laden with pizza boxes. Both Barry and Patty quickly masked their earlier solemnity with warm smiles.

“You guys like pepperoni, right?” Bart announced, setting the boxes down on the table. “In fact, please tell me you hate it. I can think of a few smug historians from my time who I’d love to take down a peg!”

Barry and Patty laughed, and the three of them gathered around. As they quickly turned in, Barry and Patty exchanged a look over the top of the pizza box - a silent agreement to set aside their worries for now and just enjoy the moment with Bart, fleeting as it might be.

"Who introduced AI Systems,, where did the AI History or purpose came into existence?",CourtofAges,1hqf50r,2024-12-31 08:54:13,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CourtofAges/comments/1hqf50r/who_introduced_ai_systems_where_did_the_ai/,Far-War-3804,,"https://preview.redd.it/va5d66fxv6ae1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f1b961ceb59c8c34e30ca7d54a3e8d96c7559f

**Who introduced AI Systems,, where did the AI History or purpose came into existence?**

**The history of AI and its purpose is rooted in humanity's desire to create machines that can replicate aspects of human intelligence. Here's an overview of how AI systems came into existence and evolved:**

# Origins of AI Concept

1. **Ancient Foundations**:
   * Early myths and stories like the Greek tale of Talos (a mechanical giant) or the Jewish legend of the Golem show humanity's longstanding fascination with creating intelligent artifacts.
   * Philosophers like Aristotle laid the groundwork for logic and reasoning, which later became crucial for AI development.
2. **Early Theoretical Work**:
   * **Alan Turing (1950s)**: In his seminal paper *""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,""* Turing proposed the idea of machines simulating human intelligence and introduced the ""Turing Test"" to measure it.
   * **John McCarthy (1956)**: McCarthy, often called the ""Father of AI,"" coined the term ""Artificial Intelligence"" at the Dartmouth Conference, considered the birth of AI as a field of study.

# Key Milestones in AI History

1. **1950s–1960s: The Dawn of AI**:
   * Early programs like the **Logic Theorist** (1956) by Newell and Simon could solve mathematical problems.
   * Focus was on symbolic reasoning, logical problem solving, and basic game-playing systems.
2. **1970s–1980s: The AI Winter**:
   * High expectations led to disillusionment when AI systems failed to deliver on their promises.
   * Funding cuts and skepticism stalled progress.
3. **1990s–2000s: Revival and Practical Applications**:
   * Advances in computing power and algorithms reignited AI research.
   * Milestones like IBM's **Deep Blue** defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov (1997) demonstrated AI's potential.
4. **2010s: Deep Learning Revolution**:
   * Breakthroughs in neural networks and the availability of big data enabled AI systems to excel in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.
   * Systems like **Google’s AlphaGo** (2016) defeated the world champion in Go, a complex board game.
5. **2020s: Widespread AI Adoption**:
   * AI systems like OpenAI's GPT (including this model), image generation tools, and voice assistants became integrated into daily life, impacting industries like healthcare, education, and entertainment.

# Purpose of AI

AI was introduced to:

1. **Replicate Human Intelligence**: Mimic human cognitive functions like reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.
2. **Automate Tasks**: Perform repetitive or complex tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans.
3. **Enhance Human Capabilities**: Augment decision-making, creativity, and productivity.
4. **Understand Intelligence**: Explore and model human cognition to advance our understanding of how the brain works.

# Pioneers of AI

Some of the key figures who contributed to AI’s development include:

* **Alan Turing**: Theoretical foundations for computing and intelligence.
* **John McCarthy**: Coined the term ""AI"" and contributed to programming languages like Lisp.
* **Marvin Minsky**: Co-founder of the MIT AI Laboratory and a pioneer in machine learning and robotics.
* **Herbert Simon and Allen Newell**: Developed early AI systems like the Logic Theorist."

“This one would like to congratulate you on getting this ship safely into orbit.” Meadow Muffin said with a chirp. 

“I thought you said I’d be co-piloting that!” I said to Villi Kersch.  

Villi wistfully looked at the minibar she had next to her chair, but she flashed me what looked like an incredibly smug look instead of opening it. 

“If anything went wrong we were both here to help, and besides, I wanted to keep an eye on these sensor readings.” Villi replied coolly. “Besides, you’ve launched in atmosphere before.”

I rolled my eyes. Given the patchwork repairs we did to get here, I was not pleased with Villi suddenly having me pilot us to orbit, but the next step we were going to take was equally daunting. We were going to make sure the satellite guarding the planet would let us return next time by deactivating its defenses. 

“Speaking of the sensor readings, are you picking up anything from that orbital defense platform? I should probably get Scheya up here so we can talk with this thing.” 

“You really think it could tell the difference between our translators and a live Sellyn?” Villi asked dismissively. 

“This one is starting to wonder if you read any of the summaries I wrote  . If it is required we could go over the full reports in detail.” Meadow Muffin said. For a moment it sounded like she lacked her normal cheerfulness too. 

I couldn’t blame her. We had spent a lot of time setting working on making return trips to this planet safe for others. Danger aside, I imagined it also meant a lot to Meadow Muffin  as well, considering her career was probably on the line. 

Villi Kirsch looked down at her systems console, as if she was trying to avoid setting Meadow Muffin off further. 

“Uh, Meadow Muffin, can you take a look at these readings?” Villi said with some alarm. 

I looked at the screen, but seeing both of Meadow Muffin’s antennae stop out of the corner of my eye distracted me. 

“This one would like to confirm if the sensors were calibrated properly or not.” 

That was an odd statement consider she had done the work on the sensors herself. 

“They read fine on the pre-flight check. Clearing orbit would have been way more difficult if there were any issues. What do you two see?” I asked as I stared at my screen trying to understand. 

Villi Kersch got out of her seat and pulled out a bottle of some dark brown fluid before walking over to me.  Tapping on the view controls the readings changed. 

“This is a view of all the recent hyperspace trails in the system .” Villi said as she pointed awkwardly with the bottle in hand. She was clenching onto it like it was her lifeline. “What’s more is that these exits are rapid. They’re all blueshifted far more than you’d normally see on transports or other civilian craft on an approach.” 

There were dozens of contacts on the screen. And since sensor data was all in real space, that meant that even if any of this was fresh data, it had happened several hours ago. Light latency meant there could be more. And they were heading towards the planet, or more likely towards the satellite we were planning on visiting. 

“Meadow Muffin, what galactic powers would have a fleet this big?” Villi asked while she started to pace around the bridge.  

I flipped over to comms and started checking for any hints of chatter. The silence was odd, even more so since we had expected the satellite to try to communicate with us. 

“This one could name each, but analyzing the data further would yield a better answer. I will send results to the main screen as they are matched to known trail patterns.” 

Continuing to pace around, Villi brushed her own antennae back, her face looking particularly colorful due to her Nimeccu biology before looking at the main screen. “This is a hodgepodge of ships, not a school. What are the odds they’re being camouflaged? I’ve seen the Grabbun do that in a fight.” 

The screen had a lot of different signatures, and was struggling to list them all, but it looked primarily like Calaxian forces, and their allies based on the labels. Even with all the homework I had done for my diplomatic work, I was no expert on fleet configurations outside of the basics, so I felt really out of my depth. Even so, I could tell this was a large force. 

Calaxians also meant we ran the risk of their disparate factions with their own designs on things. I thought back to the group that had tried to abduct me and had caught Mica instead. 

“This one wouldn’t assume trail masking. It doesn’t produce results similar to other known types like we are seeing.” 

“What about a coalition?” I asked, “Different groups working together towards a common cause could result in a variety of vessels being sent.” 

“I don’t see any patterns that match known Verminaut Bureaucracy designs.” Villi muttered. 

I looked at her screen and started to make sense of what we were seeing. Blue shifting meant it was coming in our direction, or at least that of the planet. Based on the speed and distance the screen was assigning to each contact, they were coordinating to show up around the same time, and that was going to be very soon. 

“A force this large could only be here to take out that weapons platform.” I said, “I’ve not heard any radio chatter from them or the platform which also doesn’t bode well. We need to change course right away, maybe break orbit and run silent.” 

If they weren’t broadcasting they weren’t negotiating, not that I needed to spell that the details from a lengthy interstellar treaty to Villi or Meadow Muffin to make that clear. 

“If we break orbit won’t that thing fire at us if we come back? That wasn’t the deal we made with the Sellyn. You really want to strand Scheya off their home planet?” 

I guess Villi did read Meadow Muffin’s notes. She paced a bit more and awkwardly adjusted her jacket. “I can change our orbit to something a bit safer. If we’re not being looked at it might even trick them into thinking we’re a captured asteroid. It will be a bit risky, military ships tend to have better sensors than most.” 

“It’s your call.” I said. 

“This one survived landing on the planet once, and will defer to your judgement Nimeccu Villi Kersch.” 

“No need to be so formal.” Villi sighed, as she sat down in her chair, setting her bottle down, still unopened. “Keep an eye on the sensors and comms, I’ll take care of things here.” 

I sent a message to Mica relaying what was going on, since the last thing I needed was for Scheya or Odette to panic. Then I started scouring everything in front of me, be it comms or hyperspace signatures. 

It was eerily silent, but the pattern matches piled up further. There were dozens of ships converging to fight the same thing that had managed to ground us from orbit without destroying our ship, and managed to take out a Verminaut capital ship. A lack of communications, even encrypted ones, was a bit foreboding. 

I wondered what the satellite was ‘thinking’ about the situation as well. There had been no communication from it yet either. 

I could hear Villi sigh and tap on her unopened bottle as we completed course adjustment maneuvers. Peeking out I could see Meadow Muffin’s elytra twitching a bit as she brushed at her antennae while continuing to manipulate her readouts as well.  I hoped the tense atmosphere didn’t extend to Mica and the others. 

“How long until all these contacts show up in orbit?” I asked. 

Meadow Muffin took a moment to get the information before replying, “This one estimates a coordinated rendezvous within effective range of the defense platform by the time we have nearly completed a full orbit.” 

Given the timing I was glad Villi had changed our course. The further away we were from any fighting the better. 

“I bet the Calaxians have an observation post out here somewhere at the edges of the system if they know where their target is.” Villi added, “Even if the combatants don’t notice us, it will, so we better hope any fighting doesn’t last several hours. The last thing we need is to get swept up in this situation when we’re so close to getting out of here.” 

Given the Calaxian ships that had jumped into the star system we were in, it seemed obvious in retrospect. While not directly confrontational with the Verminauts they weren’t staunch allies either. 

I thought about what I knew about the Calaxian Plumbage. Spying and diplomacy was more their field of expertise. As for starting a fight? 

I swiped through the list of hyperspace signatures we had collected so far, looking at the ships not matching Calaxian designs. 

“What if this force is made mostly of Calaxian ships because they started going early?” I asked. “The early bird gets the worm?”  

“I’ve never heard anyone describe it like that, but it could fit some of the tactics I’ve seen Calaxian security patrols use.” Villi Kersch said. “The other ships were probably assigned with them in battlegroups and jumped with them to avoid breaking formation. If we are expecting more ships trying to catch up, they’ll probably be jumping in much closer to make up for the early birds. Assuming we’re not already seeing some hasty jumps into the star system already.” 

I looked for any newer signatures, but Meadow Muffin must have been faster to check. 

“This one can confirm the most recent signatures are fairly new. If the defense platform continues to react like it has previously, we should start hearing radio transmissions soon.” 

“I’ll keep an open channel.” I replied. I was already monitoring for it, and anything else that came through radio or even hyperspace transmissions. 

The only ‘transmission’ I had received so far was from Mica asking me to keep him in the loop if anything else happened. I wondered if he even told Odette anything was going on. At least he was probably keeping Scheya calm. 

As our orbit rounded the planet the comms burst into static, breaking the silence. I started to adjust it down, but I could hear words coming through. 

“Hostile…” was all I could hear at first, but there was too much static. At least now I understood it was transmitting in a dialect of the Sellyn language, although that was likely not the same as the language of its makers. 

I could see Meadow Muffin furiously manipulating her controls, and Villi Kersch poised in her seat to maneuver the ship if necessary. 

Despite my efforts, I felt like it was more a result of a better position to receive than anything I had done to clear up the signal when I heard the next intelligible message. 

“…are on alert. This…”

Static returned and I instinctively gave the side of the console I was at a whack that probably didn’t help, but the message cut in again regardless. 

“…under protection. Hostiles will be destroyed with extreme prejudice.” 

“I think our chances of safely disabling that thing are gone. If they destroy it we can get Scheya back later after we sort out the diplomatic situation at least.” I said. 

“Not a bad assessment, but if we try to leave now we will be detected by these warships. We’re going to need to look for a better opportunity or they might just try to capture us… or try to shoot us down.” Villi said. 

Meadow Muffin also added her thoughts, “This one doubts the current force could successfully contest this conflict. The weapons on these frigates and destroyers are likely not enough to win a war of attrition.” 

Villi looked at Meadow Muffin with exasperation. “You’re not seriously suggesting we try to approach it if all these ships lose the fight are you?” 

“Let’s just do what we can to stay safe and we’ll worry about the other details later.” I suggested. 

“This one suggests being ready for that sooner rather than later. I have obtained a visual confirmation of the ships approaching the defense platform and they’re almost in known effective weapons range for Calaxian ships.” 

I turned my attention to the screen.

At this distance we would have never found them without knowing where to look from the hyperspace signatures, but Meadow Muffin wasn’t joking about a visual confirmation. The details weren’t perfect, but I was able to see a fleet of Calaxian Plumage ships, including their telltale markings. 

“Comms just picked up a short databurst sent to hyperspace from those ships.” I advised as I got the alert. I didn’t need to review the message to know what it was saying, because the ships were already powering up their weapons. 

“They’re starting the attack.” Villi muttered. 

A moment later the attack did indeed start, but not from the Calaxian ships. Multiple beams of energy shot through the Calaxian ships like a lance. As it burned through their hulls the ships exploded in the colors only burning metal could produce, little more than fireworks announcing the beginning of the show. 

Radio communications started to light up our comms as well, primarily Calaxians, but with other parties chiming in. The lack of any real encryption lent itself to this being a hastily assembled coalition for different groups. The Calaxians were singing what sounded like ballad, although it was broken up by voices occasionally cutting out. 

As the lightshow progressed the shear multitude of Calaxian ships did manage to get some shots off, but it didn’t seem very effective because it didn’t stop or slow the satellite from continuing to methodically destroy the Calaxian fleet. I hoped the Sellyn wouldn’t panic from the growing lightshow above their planet. 

“This one is picking up fresh hyperspace exit patterns.” Meadow Muffin announced, “Various matches, Grabbun, Zaklug… Helix.”  

I turned my attention to the display listing those and noticed it was still populating. Between light lag and much closer hyperspace exits the screen was no longer just storing information but rapidly scrolling through it. I had a feeling Meadow Muffin would still be listing ship types if she hadn’t trailed off with venom at the sight of the Helix Mana showing up to this fight as well. 

Comms grew increasingly active, and we heard more and more about what was going on. Villi seemed to intently be listening to some chatter that sounded like a Grabbun dialect. 

Villi Kersch finally opened the bottle she had been clutching. She looked at it, then looked at me before imbibing some, “Looks like your theory about a coalition was on the bottle.” She continued after a moment, “The Calaxians, or at least the ones that haven’t been blown up by that thing, are getting an earful about starting the fight early. It looks like they disrupted the planned attack.” 

Meadow Muffin added her commentary as well. “This one finds it concerning that the Grabbun wouldn’t just call off a botched attack. They must be heavily invested in the attack for them to ignore a lack of discipline like that. But the force so far has been made of masses of smaller ships, mostly older designs with retrofitted weapon arrays.” 

Listening in further, Villi Kersch grimaced. “It seems like they’re here because they watched that Verminaut ship go down. They want what your lot was after Meadow Muffin.” 

That explained the lack of Verminaut ships. In fact, the whole battle seemed like a cluster of rivals, their allies, and opportunistic mercenaries. 

I listened into the parts Villi Kersch was, trying to see if my translator would catch anything important. Something beyond the famous grouchiness of the Grabbun as they coordinated their forces. 

More and more ships jumped into the system at an incredible rate. The incoming warships appeared quicker than they could be shot down, but their approaches seemed haphazard. That probably helped them out however, because any time that they clustered the defense platform would exploit that to maximize destruction at every opportunity. 

The thought of how quickly we would have been shot out of the sky if the thing had deliberately tried to destroy our ship was chilling. I wondered why it hadn’t, and instead forced us down. I couldn’t stay in my thoughts however, given our front row seats to the current situation. 

It wasn’t completely clear who would win at the pace the fight was going, but unless the attackers had an ace up their sleeve things weren’t looking good for them currently. It was clear they were using some of the most advanced weapons that anyone in the galaxy had ever designed, but there wasn’t much they could do when their target was blowing up most ships before they could do anything meaningful.  

The radio traffic wasn’t quite as discordant as the hyperspace jumps seemed to be. If anything it was quite coordinated despite the massive number of casualties. Or as coordinated as so many different species could be. They were keenly reporting damage, but not detailing their own ships, but their target. 

“What if the first waves were more to test the waters? And they’re preparing something else?” I asked. 

Villi Kersch took a couple large gulps from her bottle in response to my question. 

They were probing it for weakness, noting how long it took to acquire targets around itself, power fluctuations, anything they could decern as they poked at its neigh indestructible shell. They were chipping away at it slowly, but their adversary was essentially blasting their attacks away with its own. 

The attacking force needed a lot more firepower to win, but they seemed sure they would have it. 

 “This one would place larger ship entries on the far side of the planet for maneuverability options. I will keep an antennae out for any scattered exit signatures.” Meadow Muffin said. 

“Is it possible to change our orbit without drawing attention? Maybe something that will let us make a quicker escape without getting noticed?” I asked. Being able to peacefully deactivate the satellite was clearly off the table but getting away unscathed wasn’t. 

Villi Kersch ran her hand over her face before starting to slowly maneuver the ship. “Let’s hope we aren’t considered a target by anyone here.” 

We slowly moved away from the planet, in a trajectory I thought could have been caused by space debris from the battle if I didn’t know Villi was slowly moving the ship. I kept an eye on the fighting however, making sure none of the combatants looked out of place. The chaos of the fighting was great cover however. 

Great enough cover that I didn’t notice the comms blinking right away. 

Something or someone was hailing us via hyperspace communications. I started silently checking the message, not wanting to interrupt the other two. 

It was encrypted but I recognized it and scrambled to connect my data pad to the comms console. What was a data format like this doing out here? 

--- 

Giada tried not to look too smug, but she was smiling wide. 

“See? We got the message to Ruri and that thing is too busy fighting with these aliens to have intercepted it.  ” 

“Cleverly sending Ruri a message or not, that satellite is still the most dangerous thing in this galaxy.” the Transmuter said. 

It was the closest thing to a compliment Giada had heard since they jumped into this system  in a rush to beat the massing Verminaut forces. There was already a firefight in progress, but they were still out of range to see it, rather picking up on it from stray hyperspace communications between the combatants. While hyperspace communications weren’t instant either, at this range they might as well be compared to lightspeed. 

“We’re getting another message back now. They’re still in orbit around the planet but were already adjusting course to avoid anyone seeing them. They want to know how much they should risk detection to get away from there.” Jett said, as he made sure their improvised changes held up. 

It was a little strange how the Spagyric Golem was being kept away from the comms they had set up. When Giada had proposed setting up a message that would avoid the satellite the Transmuter had been worried about she was sure he was going to task the Golem with setting it up. It would have been faster, but Giada and Jett had made short work of the modifications. 

“Is my child okay?” Vouloir asked impatiently as he clung tightly to Sela Zuria. Jett was already typing something back, asking for everyone’s status. 

Giada thought about everything the Transmuter had discussed with them as they were drawing closer, at least before they had jumped into the star system in a hurry when they realized that the Verminaut ships they had been sneaking by had suddenly picked up their pace. How quickly a hyperspace gate network could move a fleet compared to normal hyperspace transit was a bit terrifying. It was even more terrifying how quickly the Verminauts could speed things up when they had any urgency. The most terrifying thing however was the string of curses the Transmuter had muttered as they went in. 

Jett started reading off the reply he got a minute later. “Their entire crew is fine. Apparently they also have a native from the planet they took in order to try to deactivate the satellite, but that plan was more or less ruined by all the fighting. Ruri included a list of the hyperspace signatures they’ve detected so far.” 

Vouloir looked relieved, as did Sela until the Listener’s tail wrapped around her thigh. Giada pulled the clingy Listener off of Sela and uncomfortably patted him on the back.  

Leaning over Jett’s shoulder and reading the correspondence himself, the Transmuter sighed. “Looks like more ships are still pouring into the grinder. I didn’t think the galactic powers would rally a fleet large enough this fast.” 

Giada didn’t think the Verminauts that were more or less on their tail did either. It was going to be messy to rendezvous with Ruri’s ship and get out of there. 

“You think they will destroy the satellite?” Giada asked. 

The Transmuter frowned. “We need to be out of here before we find out. It would be a simple matter if Ruri and the others weren’t next to the planet but performing a hyperspace jump that close to the firefight is not a good idea either. Have them continue their course.”

Jett typed the reply, before getting another message then another. “Looks like Ruri patched in Mica and Odette to the conversation.” He turned to the Transmuter, while gesturing at Sela and Vouloir, “Would it be okay if I patched in their data pads?” 

After a few minutes Jett had set it up for Vouloir while Giada set up Sela’s data pad. 

“Due to the nature of the connection its all just one giant chatroom, so sorry about the lack of privacy.” Giada said before she handed the data pad back to Sela. She was pretty sure her explanation was falling on deaf ears, but it must have been totally ignored on the other side given the incredibly raunchy message that Odette immediately typed out. 

“It is nice to hear that child still carries the tune of my people.” Vouloir hummed happily. 

Giada waited patiently while watching Jett read through the message on the terminal they had set up before he looked at her with tired eyes. “Really?” 

“Pay up.” Giada demanded. 

Jett got up with a deep breath and forcefully placed his wager in Giada’s hands before heading for the door. “Take over, I’m going to get some coffee.” 

Ignoring Jett’s displeasure with his bet, Giada sat down, and immediately started typing her own greetings to Ruri, ignoring Mica’s apologies for the outburst from Odette. 

“Hey, is there anything else we can do from here?” she asked after hitting send. 

“Have Ruri keep an eye on the fight as they get out of there. We need to know if the situation changes. The last thing we need is for that satellite to use its real weapon.” 

Giada started relaying the warning, “What do you mean by real weapon?” 

“It would be too dangerous to assume our line of communication is secure, I’ll explain when everyone is back together.” 

“Another secret for when you spill the beans to your daughter.” Sela pointed out. The Transmuter had a grim look on his face, but he didn’t say anything to that. 

Vouloir didn’t seem to catch any of the negative air at all from this, “Understandable, I want to make sure my precious Odette can hear the news of Ottilie’s pregnancy with all four ears.” 

“I’ll just make sure they know they should be careful in a hurry.” Giada said as she finished typing out her message. 

Skimming through the back and forth between Mica, Odette, and their parents, Ruri’s messages were more about the current situation, as she had been asked. The combat was finally slowing down, as hyperspace jumps to reinforce the attacking ships seemed to slow down to a crawl. Except Ruri didn’t seem to think the fight was done. 

And judging by the Transmuter’s pacing, he didn’t either. 

Ruri helped Giada set up a link so she could monitor the hyperspace signatures without it interrupting the conversations between everyone else. By the time they had set it up Jett was coming back with a carafe and a bunch of cups. 

“Anything new happen?” Jett asked as he poured Giada a cup. 

Giada took a sip before ceding her seat back to Jett. “Lull in the action, so we set up some remote telemetry here. Not sure if it will help at all but at least we won’t be blind to how much of a mess this whole situation is.” 

“So much for all the diplomatic work.” Jett said as sat down and stared at the screen. “Maybe we’ll get lucky and they’re calling off the—""

Jett suddenly stopped talking as the screen started to light up with new information. It was like the finale of a fireworks show. The trickle of ships reinforcing the attackers had turned into an all-out blitz. 

“Looks like our timetable just went from having time to slip away quietly to a set of fan blades turning on inside a toilet. Tell Ruri that they need to start spooling up their hyperspace drive now for an in-system jump. They should be able to jump here before it registers on any of the sensors of the ships that are fighting.” 

“That will leave the ship dead in the water for another jump, what if someone tries to follow?” 

“Just tell them. I’ll have the Spagyric Golem prepare to assist in the evacuation of their ship. We can accommodate them here. They should be prepared to clear the logs and manifest. The captain of that ship has done smuggling operations before, they will know what to do. Inform them they will be compensated by myself and Vouloir for the total loss of the ship, even if they recover it later.” 

The Transmuter’s orders had a veneer of calm but there was an urgency that did not help Giada or Jett feel calm at all. 

“And tell Ruri I’ll explain everything when we’re all together.” 

The incoming feed of recognized hyperspace activity wasn’t slowing down either, but among the mass there were dozens upon dozens of hyperspace signatures recognized within five minutes of each other, all from unknown ships. And one of them was so large that Jett wondered if it was a sensor error. 

“Unidentified ships. Should we inform Ruri?” Giada asked in a bit of a panic. 

“Don’t let the pattern scrambling fool you. Few forces in this galaxy can muster such a coordinated jump timing, let alone with a stream of loosely allied ships streaming in at the same time. Those are all Grabbun ships. The big one should be their flagship.” 

---

The Giga Extro Karkin had just returned to real space, and onboard the bridge was the Admiral of the Grabbun forces, with a grim look written on his carapace. 

Admiral Paralith was too old, and too sober for the cyclone of claws that was unfolding before him. 

The Calaxians had started the assault earlier than planned, which had turned the entire battle plan into turmoil. Calaxian forces had taken more casualties than expected as a result, and while that was their own damned fault, it did not reflect well on the Grabbun strategic command, which in turn did not reflect well on their forces. 

Having to use and reveal the full capabilities of the flagship was not the first choice of Admiral Paralith. But the political realities of the situation demanded by the galactic community and Grabbun central command were clear. The weapons platform defending the planet they had appeared above had to be destroyed. 

One of the bridge officers raised a claw before relaying important news, “Calaxians are reporting the Verminauts are massing much faster than we expected.” 

Another stupid complication. And made worse by how secretive the Calaxians had been. It might even have been why they rushed in like idiots before everyone else. If they had just alerted the alliance things could have gone far more smoothly, and they would have controlled the situation with a clenched claw. 

The Calaxians had managed to locate the massing point the Verminauts were using. Apparently they weren’t taking the declaration at the Galactic Moot censuring them lying down, and had an entire fleet mounted. Admiral Paralith suspected they had an observation satellite in the system as well, but to have slipped it under the beaks of the Calaxians meant they were likely hiding more capabilities once again. 

The threat the Verminauts posed was not to be taken lightly, but the situation still favored the side the Grabbun had taken. If their forces could take control of the system, and in effect the planet the Verminauts were coveting, they could effectively end hostilities before anything could start. They could even demand fair passage of their gate network to move ships. 

“Make sure the VIP doesn’t leave the planet, and if they do take them into custody. The last thing we need is to let the Verminauts get a single leg up on us. Keep me posted if their forces decide to jump in.” 

If they could keep the former Dirtmen Ambassador out of the clutches of the Calaxians as well as the Verminauts it would be advantageous as well, but the Admiral kept this thought to himself. Mulling the situation over further, the Admiral’s eyes scanned the main view screen. 

“In the meantime, we should be proceeding with our planned assault. What is the status of the primary target?” 

He knew the answer, since the information fed to them by the fleet via hyperspace communications was displayed on the screen for him, but his officers were there to advise, not just follow orders blindly. The more claws they had clicking on the battle the better. 

“Starting to falter, but still holding up longer than expected. It appears to be charging up for something. We’re keeping the defensive line while our weapons prime for the first salvo.”

Admiral Paralith clenched a claw. Everything was supposed to be ready to fire as soon as they entered the fray, but the Calaxians jumping the gun had messed up every part of the plan. Even their exit patterns were 20% looser than what they were capable of. He couldn’t blame them entirely for the sloppiness but every dead Grabbun in this fight was made less honorable by their actions. 

The defensive line would prevent any outsized risk for the Giga Extro Karkin but every shot by the target had been a ball of destruction. Its weapons far outclassed anything they had fired at is so far, even if it was starting to slow down. 

“Let’s aim to destroy the target before it finishes whatever last gambit it has up its sleeve.” 

Of course, the weapons that had been fired at their target didn’t include those of the Giga Extro Karkin. They were going to turn it into slag, and gain control over the planet’s orbit. The Admiral just hoped the Verminauts wouldn’t try to get in the way of the after party. 

“Weapon systems are almost ready for a full barrage.” 

Or maybe they could. After everything that had gone wrong today Admiral Paralith would be okay with putting them in their place in a less roundabout way. He could respect their logistics, but tactically they were boorish. The only time the Admiral had ever heard any evidence to the contrary was during the Helix-Verminaut War. Verminaut tactics mostly consisted of sending larger ships after smaller ones. If the Grabbun had tried to do that here they would have undoubtedly lost their flagship before it could fire. 

“Battle group reports ready. The firing solution has been accepted. Commencing bombardment now.” 

Admiral Paralith watched panel after panel of weapon system go from ready to firing on the flagship as well as their battlegroup, as well as the other ships in the Grabbun fleet, and a few allies that were actually bothering to coordinate. 

As the attack reached the target, the visuals they were receiving from ships closest to it became more and more chaotic. The target went from receiving continuous fire from the allied strike force to being completely engulfed in the assault in a ball of explosions and flak. 

The assault continued for quite some time in an attack that would overwhelm even the best ship’s defenses. It was so complete that it made it hard for their sensors to even pick up what their attacks were doing. 

Coordinated fire was not easy to pull off from so many different places in space, but since most of it came from the flagship, it was much easier. Of course, these weapons were made to fight much bigger targets than the one they had today, such as Verminaut capital ships. The relative peace in the galaxy precluded such fights from happening, but the Grabbun certainly were fond of being prepared. 

As their bombardment ended, they waited for the glowing mass of metal to cool down so they could determine the damage. In the meantime weapons arrays and batteries were reloaded and recharged in preparation for another assault. 

Speaking up, one of the officers gave a situation report, “Fleet sensors having difficulty as expected, but we still are detecting some sort of power fluctuation from the target. Weapons fire from the target has stopped however.” 

Admiral Paralith had to keep himself from clicking his claws. If they could capture the target without destroying it, and the planet, and the former Dirtmen ambassador, that would almost make up for the Calaxians going in gun blazing and nearly ruining the battle plans. 

Of course, they would have to play it safe and be prepared to fire again if the target was still dangerous. It might be possible it was charging a self-destruct mechanism for example. Directing the fleet, Admiral Paralith instructed forces to “Pull back, but continue readiness preparations for the next firing solution.” 

Looking at the situation, Admiral Paralith also decided they should be ready for their other objectives. Hopefully the mess the Calaxians had made hadn’t jeopardized the rest of the alliance. The Grabbun weren’t exactly known to be diplomats but that didn’t mean they didn’t value their allies. 

“Did enough of the Zaklug and Helix forces survive this mess to start observation on the planet?” 

They might not be known for spying like the Calaxians were but that didn’t mean they didn’t have an important part to play. The last thing Admiral Paralith wanted was the Calaxians claiming the victory after they had spoiled the entire situation so badly. 

One of his officers reported the situation, “Battered but not broken. Zaklugs are still engaged with the target but are holding fire for our next barrage. Helix forces seem to be more focused on pulling back right now. They’re both waiting on an all-clear right now for the next stage.”

They weren’t perfect allies, but they certainly were more dependable than the Calaxians had been. Even other species that had contributed less forces, or even insisted on only being logistical support had been more dependable. The only saving grace the Calaxians offered now aside from the size of their forces was their refusal to retreat no matter how badly the situation seemed to have gone early. 

One of the communications officers spoke up, “Calaxians are reporting the Verminaut fleet is spooling drives at their staging point. Apparently they decided to join the fray.” 

Admiral Paralith though about the utter mess the day was. Well, at least the Calaxians were paying their way now. Their spy stations might even have just saved more lives than they had cost. 

Before he could suggest a course of action, another officer spoke up as well. 

“Power surge detected from the target. However it hasn’t fired any weapons we can detect.” 

Thinking for a moment, the Admiral sighed. “Too much of a risk that it might be trying to self-destruct, and we need to secure the planet before the Verminauts arrive. Fire another barrage as soon as the fleet is ready, and tell them to be ready to greet the bugs with another if they try anything. Have our allies move to secure the planet now.” 

Securing the planet was not a glamorous role since they were basically going to be holding it hostage against the Verminauts. Their fleet could probably still stand claw to claw with the bugs and teach them a lesson, but avoiding further conflict was equally important. 

His claws itching for something harder than brine, Paralith waited as their weapons charged and he considered what sort of ultimatum he needed to hail the Verminauts with. Maybe he’d have the Calaxians offer terms instead. 

An officer alerted that “Weapons ready for the next salvo.” 

“Fire.” Admiral Paralith confirmed with disinterest.  

As their primary target finally exploded into melted metal, the Grabbun fleet commander waited for the Verminauts to come in for the next stage of the conflict, not knowing what else they had invited into the galaxy.

Giada opened the next door and peeked her head inside. 

Four ears tuned to her like a satellite waiting for launch commands. 

As if he was expecting her, Vouloir greeted her instantly, “Hello beautiful.” 

“Not a chance.” 

Giada shut the door and sighed. 

“How big is this ship anyway?” Jett asked as Giada stomped to the next door. 

“It isn’t bigger on the inside. Although the material engineering on this one is years ahead of anything I’ve seen. But it’s like whoever designed this is holding back.”

Jett mused for a moment on Giada’s comment as they suspiciously looked though some sort of closet together.

“I dunno, it looks like the same stuff used for Ruri’s office back when we were still doing the diplomatic stuff.” 

Giada closed the closet with another sigh. “I know during the war the Golem was repurposed to build stuff rather than fulfill the medical role it was designed for, but isn’t that just a little too convenient?” 

“One conspiracy at a time.” Jett said with a hushed tone, as if the Golem could be listening to them. 

Both of them heard the clacking of metallic paws in the hallway. 

“One conspiracy at a time.” Giada muttered as Jett’s pet robot scampered up to them. 

It emulated a quizzical look at the two, then proceeded to run circles around them like it had energy to burn. 

Giada found the emulated behaviors to be unnerving and unnecessary. An uncanny valley of behaviors from a contraption that had a claw for a face. But what was really unnerving? 

“Who’s a good bot? Who’s a good bot?” 

The most unnerving thing was how Jett was fawning over the thing. 

“Shoo.” 

Jett came to the Lesser Golem’s defense immediately, holding it like he was protecting it from Giada. “Don’t shoo it. What if it wants to help us?” 

“It’s getting in the way of us searching. This is like the fourth time this hour it has distracted you. You opened the same door three times the last time you got distracted by it. If anything, I think it is specifically sabotaging us.” 

As if to specifically undermine her, the Lesser Golem started making a whimpering sound while trying to cower away from her. 

Jett saw the look on her face however. 

“Okay buddy, party is over. You’re impeding our progress. We’ll hang out later.” 

This just caused the machine to complain louder. 

Jett scolded it, “That’s just sad. Shoo.” 

It suddenly skittered off. With something in its ‘mouth’.

“Isn’t that your data pad?” Giada asked, a bit dumbstruck. 

“Yes. It is.” Jett said, after quickly checking his pockets. 

They both started chasing their interloper. 
 
“Get back here you little rustbag!” 

The robot was fast on its four legs, and was at the end of the corridor in a moment. They rounded a corner, but the Lesser Golem had a greater ability to turn the corners despite its apparent lack of traction as it slid back and forth. It tightly gripped the data pad in its mouth as it ran for dear life. 

Giada and Jett didn’t catch up to it until they had it cornered at the end of hallway. The Lesser Golem was trying to get its only means of escape open, but was having trouble manipulating the door without dropping its prize. 

Somehow it got the door open just as Giada was about to grab the mechanical beast, and it skittered inside. Before the door could slam in their faces however, Giada and Jett both took hold of it and prevented it from closing. 

Inside the Lesser Golem was cowering in the arms of a child. What must have been a Delfovian child.  

If it wasn’t for the machine being there, or this being the ship the Transmuter has prepared with the help of the Spagyric Golem, Giada might have called security. She assumed Jett must have come to the same conclusion, because he had frozen up rather than screaming bloody murder. 

Both parties stared at each other for longer than was comfortable before Giada decided to ask the obvious question. 

“Who the hell are you?” 

They were both more surprised at the answer they got, which their translators didn’t bother to parse. 

“My name is Silica. Are you friends of Ruri?” 

Jett looked more than a bit pale, so Gaida continued, trying to keep him calm. “Yes, do you know Ruri?”  

The Delfovian child nodded excitedly before letting the Lesser Golem in her arms go. She held onto the data pad the machine brought her before looking at Jett with concern. 

“Is this yours? Do you want it back?” 

Jett slowly took a deep breath before taking it out of her hands. His voice was shaky, but he managed to ask a question, “Do you know who we are?” 

“You’re Ruri’s friends right?” Silica asked back. 

“Yes,” Giada answered, “We’re friends of Ruri.” 

Jett put his hands on his face for a moment, but waved Giada away when she put a hand around his shoulder in concern. 

“So it’s true? We’re going to see Ruri?” Silica asked. 

“That’s the plan.” Giada said as Jett groaned. 

She looked at him as he grumbled, but he ignored her glare. “Silica, are you Sandfish by any chance?” 

“That’s Special Agent Sandfish!”  Silica corrected Jett proudly, before looking around like she was in trouble, “Wait, don’t tell on me, I’m not supposed to be Special Agent Sandfish anymore. I don’t know what being grounded is, but it sounded unpleasant .” 

Giada and Jett looked at each other for a moment with raised eyebrows. 

“We’ll be quiet, but it would be nice if you could answer some more questions. Mason seemed to think you knew somethings about what was going on.” Giada probed. 

“Know stuff about what?” Silica asked as she stared intently at the two. 

“How do you know Ruri?” Giada asked. 

“I’m Ruri’s sister.” Silica said proudly. 

“Ruri’s sister?” Jett asked incredulously. 

“Well obviously not by blood.” Silica pointed out, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. 

“Ruri never mentioned you.” Giada said. 

“Well obviously.” Jett said, “Imagine it now, ‘Oh hey, did I mention I have a genocidal alien sister? Want to see some pictures?’” 

Silicia started to look like she was going to cry, and Jett sighed. “Look kid, I don’t mean anything by it. I’m just saying it would have been hard for Ruri to explain to other people. Other Delfovians did a lot of horrible things to us. But I know that wasn’t you okay?” 

The kid wiped her face, but Giada felt it was more mimicry of the action than actually wiping tears. 

“Let’s change the subject. Is Ruri a clone?” Jett asked. 

Silicia tilted her head. “I was cloned. That’s when the Spagyric Golem makes a genetic copy of someone. Ruri isn’t a copy though. The Spagyric Golem wouldn’t kill Ruri because Ruri isn’t super mean and bad.” 

“You’re a copy of someone who did bad things?” Giada asked. 

Silicia punctuated her words slowly, like the question was stupid, “Gen-etic  copy.”

“Sorry, I was just trying to ask who the person you were cloned from was.”

Jett interjected, “They weren’t a person.” 

Silica shrugged, “Not when the sample was taken. At that point they were a gross paste! Whatever it was hurt Ruri so they definitely deserved it.” 

Giada figured she’d ask one of the other questions Mason has planted in their minds. “Do you know who Ruri’s mother is?” 

“Nope.” Silica shrugged as she stared intently at Giada’s hands. 

Giada dodged Silica’s attempts to touch her hands, “Do you know anything else about what’s going on?” 

Silica looked indignant. “Nobody tells me anything.”  

It was at that moment the door opened, with the Transmuter standing there with a look of frustration. Frustration he punctuated with a curse. 

“I don’t know how they found me.” Silica lied immediately. 

Giada and Jett didn’t bother to contradict Silica’s assertion, but rather found a new target for questioning. 

“You cloned a Delfovian? Are you insane?” Jett asked. 

“Hey!” Silica protested. 

The Transmuter rubbed his face. “Ruri wanted someone to talk to while she was recovering .” 

“Like that makes any damn sense!” Jett yelled. 

“Recovering? What exactly did you do to Ruri?” Giada asked. 

The Transmuter looked at Silicia with concern. “I’m not sure what Silicia exactly told you about what happened when the Delfovians attacked decades ago, but I doubt it included the specifics of total pediatric reconstruction.” 

“Decades? Ruri isn’t even an adult.” Giada pointed out. 

“You always were clever. It’s a shame Ruri fought me on having the Great Work headhunt you when you found the paper Ruri carelessly left on the Internet about superluminal travel. Kept insisting it was not your fault.” 

Jett still looked upset. “Can you just spell it out for me without the jargon or are you planning on throwing us out an airlock?”  

The Transmuter’s hand found itself on his face again. “I don’t know you could even believe the truth if I told you.” 

Giada fielded her theory, “Cryogenics?” 

“Close enough. There was a war going on, so the Spagyric Golem engaged the pause button.” 

Jett’s eyes went wide, “Achronisis.” 

The Transmuter smiled. “Ultimately the how isn’t the point. Ruri was saved. We’re going to do that again. If you want answers you can listen to me tell Ruri tomorrow when we get into the system.” 

Giada looked at Jett. “One conspiracy at a time I suppose.”

Councilmember Mason looked at his hands. 

The truth was a heavy burden. Only duty was a heavier one.  

The Transmuter had shackled Mason with both.  

While there were certain perks that had come along with accepting the Transmuter’s offer, it still felt like Mason had gotten the raw end of the deal. And right now the biggest part of that was deciding whether to tell the rest of the Dirtmen Security Council the truth. The whole truth, not just the first thing he had put on the agenda after reading a small subset of the documents. 

And what about the public? Would they get to know even if Mason shared everything with the Council? 

The newest Councilmember looked to his right at Councilmember Piers. The Transmuter had taken a liking to him, even shared some secrets. But he didn’t share everything. 

Councilmember Ultman and the others would show up soon. The Transmuter had known Ultman for decades. She helped the planet unite during the war, and was instrumental in consolidating national governments into the planetary apparatus that existed today. She was on a first name basis with the man. But she didn’t know everything. 

So much made sense to Mason now. Why the Transmuter did all the things he had done. The reason the Great Work was formed, documenting genetics, advancing science, propelling technology forward. There were so many answers. 

“Commander, erm, Councilmember Mason?” 

Councilmember Piers had broken Mason’s chain of thought. 

“Yes?” Mason asked, trying not to sound as annoyed or tired as he was. 

“I know Ishi has you filling in, but how much did our mutual friend tell you? Did you visit the bunker?”

Mason wasn’t sure how much he wanted to share yet, so he answered truthfully but vaguely, just like his years of service had conditioned him to in situations like this one. “That’s more or less how I got dragged into this.” 

Maybe Snad Piers knew more than he was letting on? 

“Did you meet Silica?” 

Nothing the Transmuter had given Mason included information about anyone by that name. 

So Mason gave an answer that was true, but the right kind of vague. “Not yet.” 

Councilmember Piers paused for a second. Maybe that’s why the Transmuter had trusted him. Knowing when to keep your mouth shut was a vastly underrated ability.  

“I could understand your trepidation given Silica’s unique persuasion. Even the Transmuter was cautious for obvious reasons. I only think the Transmuter arranged a meeting because of the paperwork I dug up and because I have a family.”  

Or maybe the Transmuter was under a lot of pressure and made a mistake. 

Mason’s silent thoughts just left an uncomfortable silence that Snad continued to fill, “Shame the Transmuter had to take Silica off-world last minute, but I guess when they get back a meeting might not be out of the question.” 

The issue of whoever Silica was, or what Mason could confide in Councilmember Piers aside, there was the upcoming meeting. It was to be his first as a Councilmember, but Mason had no idea how he was going to broach any extra topics to the Council. 

They knew he had something to tell them that excluded their normal Verminaut guest. He could start with that. They would also know the Transmuter had left the planet but exactly what Mason was going to add to this was unclear. Did he want to tell them everything? The Transmuter’s past, his activities over the last several decades, and the secrets the Transmuter had uncovered? 

One thing at a time. 

Snad continued to talk about the meeting, “I’m sure the others will give you a proper welcome when they get here, and we can cover your concerns during the meeting. I’m curious what you wanted to cover without the Verminauts present, although lately they’ve been absent from more and more of these meetings.” 

Mason planned to cover some important subjects affecting immediate security concerns he found in the data dump. It still boggled him why the Transmuter hadn’t bothered to immediately share this piece of information with them. Did keeping too many secrets mean you just kept even more? Or did he not consider it important enough to bother with?

The door to the chamber was a faint sound, but Mason heard it even while Snad talked. A pair of people poured into the room. 

Councilmembers Ultman and Tappen walked into the room. 

Councilmember Tappen started speaking the second “I really hope this isn’t about the prisoners from the pirate fleet again, with all the jitters about military staging since the last Moot nobody has wanted to help us deal with negotiations. I don’t care if deporting them back to the Delfovian homeworld would be a death sentence or not.” 

Mason felt acid reflux just from hearing about the issue. It was no longer something above his pay grade so to speak. Thankfully Snad came to his rescue by reminding Tappen that it was someone else’s problem, “Councilmember Nells actually has that covered as of this morning.” 

That also explained why Seneca Nells was late instead of closely shadowing Alaina Ultman. 

Tappen scowled, “Seneca managed to actually pull it off?” 

Snad shrugged as two more members walked in. 

Councilmembers Rochester sat down as Councilmember Stanford looked at Mason for a moment before also sitting down. That just left two more stragglers before Mason was going to speak. 

Stanford must have heard what they said while walking in, because the Councilmember was bemoaning Nell’s tardiness, “Shame Councilmember Nells is running late, without Councilmember Iwata here, Councilmember Sterling would have no excuses to be the last one to show up.” 

“You think that’s going to stop any complaints about the Transmuter? I guess Sterling’s little truce couldn’t last forever.” Councilmember Tappen added. 

Mason wondered if Sterling would be on the warpath when he learned that his sister had left with the Transmuter. Hopefully their first item of business would provide enough cover. 

Councilmember Rochester leaned in a bit, “So what do I owe the pleasure of not inviting the Verminauts to this one over? Did we forget to fill out some paperwork they wanted?” 

Mason looked toward the pathway into the room, hoping for the last two before he started. He didn’t want to get ahead of himself. There was nobody coming in just yet however. 

“Shortly before Councilmember Iwata left, I was made privy to a large amount of information that has importance to our security situation.” Councilmember Mason replied. 

Before Councilmember Rochester could complain about the answer, Councilmember Ultman chimed in, “Don’t let any of them bully you into delivering your report early, we have time, and you don’t want to have to repeat yourself.” 

“I’d say you’re just covering for Seneca but if it means I don’t have to deal with the prisoner issue anymore we can wait a week.” Councilmember Tappen added, “Plus we can celebrate poor Snad here no longer being the newbie.” 

“Unless Councilmember Nells doesn’t show up by lunch we’ll have to put a raincheck on that. Don’t we still have to discuss the names of the next ships to be laid down?” Snad replied. 

There was a collective groan from some of the council, as Snad started to rattle off some names he clearly had in mind. 

Mason wondered why they didn’t have some committee handling that instead of wasting their time with it. Then he remembered how little actual security work this Council really did on a day-to-day basis, thanks in part to the Transmuter’s machinations. 

“I wasn’t even half an hour late and you’re trying to sneak your baby names onto the ships again? Even Councilmember Iwata hasn’t tried to name half the fleet after Ruri.” 

Councilmember Nells followed into the room after her rebuff of Councilmember Pier’s scheme. Mason wondered how secure the meeting room was if anyone could hear them in the hallway, but then he remembered it was guarded by a pair of Lesser Golems, assuming anyone got past the live guards and other security measures. 

As Councilmember Nells sat down, she looked around at everyone at the table. Her face contorted with concern. “Any word on where our last member is?” 

The way she said it was if saying the name would make things worse. 

Councilmember Ultman checked her data pad, “Apparently on the way up now.” 

“Probably will be upset we can’t just mulch the pirates into fertilizer.” Stanford mused. 

“Even Councilmember Sterling enjoys the moral high ground.” Nells pointed out. 

“Pretty sure that’s how we got Sterling’s begrudging vote.” Piers said. 

“Or the belief that it would fail.” Rochester said. 

Mason ultimately didn’t care what the solution was so long as it didn’t involve him. He had fought enough Delfovians, and had no desire to deal with more. 

As the Council settled in they each pulled out their data pads and check them. Mason wondered if this is why the Transmuter thought they needed babysitting, or if it was the back and forth. His career as a soldier had exposed Mason to plenty of politics but it certainly wasn’t his area of expertise, or he might have focused on climbing the ranks rather than staying with Stonewall Squad for years. 

It wasn’t long before Councilmember Sterling filed into the room without a word. 

“That’s everyone. Our newest member asked us here today to cover some important information related to our security.” Councilmember Ultman started. 

Councilmember Mason cleared his throat quietly, preparing to speak. 

“Hopefully it will clear up why my sister is currently heading towards what is looking to be a war zone.” Sterling interrupted. “Have any of you actually been paying attention to the massive ship buildups being reported near the…” Sterling paused a moment while sneering at his data pad. “Does this backwater system have a name other than alphanumeric Verminaut gibberish? I’m just going to call it the dung system considering we’re still dealing with Verminaut crap even without them here.” 

“We covered this last meeting; we are keeping an eye on the situation.” Councilmember Rochester spoke, “We’ve done our best to remain neutral despite tensions between just about all the of galaxy’s powers boiling up.”

“And yet we seem to be caught in the middle of it.” Sterling said. “All of you lean on one person messing around with the natural order of things. One freak who changes others but refuses to fix their own mutant genetics when it comes to their daughter.” 

Mason’s face read like a brick as he considered how much information he should be sharing today, but the other members of the Council collectively looked like this was a common enough frustration point that they were sick of hearing it. 

“Let’s table talk of the Transmuter for now, and hear what Councilmember Mason has to say.” Councilmember Tappen suggested to murmurs of agreement. 

“Given the situation progressing in the, uh, dung system, as the Councilmember put it, I have been provided a cache of information the likes of which we haven’t seen since after the war.” Mason started. 

The truth was what they learned after the war paled in comparison to what the Transmuter gave him. But Mason had decided to prioritize the delivery of the information so they could get through it as rationally as possible. 

Continuing, Mason started to get to the reason he called the meeting in the first place, far before he had read even a quarter of the summaries in the documents on the data pad the Transmuter had handed him. There would be more groundbreaking information to share, information that would change the foundations of what they were as people, but this had to be addressed first so they could go over the rest without anyone listening in. 

“What I’m about to reveal stays in this room for the time being, until we can decide how to address it. It is a secret that I have reason to believe the Grabbun, Helix Mana, and even the Calaxians are unaware of.” 

Rochester chimed in with a question, “What about the Verminaut Bureaucracy?” 

Mason clarified, “It concerns the Verminauts.” 

That silenced the room. Mason was afraid he might actually be able to explain the rest without any more interruptions, so he continued before he jinxed it. 

“Some of you might remember the Fields Flux incident. It happened shortly after the war, early in setting up diplomatic relations with the Verminaut Bureaucracy. Things were tense. We weren’t sure if the Verminauts that showed up were going to be our new allies after helping us put down the Delfovian threat, or if they were there as our new overlords. They didn’t seem to want to kill us, but people were scared. Then the Security Council had to suddenly deal with what was probably the worst thing that could happen, one of the Verminauts died on us.” 

“The Verminaut the Spagyric Golem went crazy and killed?” Stanford asked. 

Seneca Nells and Snad Piers both looked like this was news to them, but most of the other council members looked like this was an annoying chapter of history. 

Mason continued, “What really happened was the Spagyric Golem found something about the Verminauts that they’ve kept secret from the Galaxy for hundreds of years. They’re all infected with parasites.” 

“So what, we’re going to embarrass the Verminauts about having worms? You do know they eat literal crap right?” Tappen asked. 

“Parasites that control them.” Mason clarified. 

Mason could hear Councilmember Ultman mutter something that sounded like “Damn it Ishi.” 

“Councilmember Iwata researched the issue and found that they couldn’t infect us, but more passive detection on Verminauts has indicated that every single one is infected with these parasites. They are suspected to cause high larval mortality which indicates why the Verminauts have such a low population for a space faring species.” 

“Wait, every one of them has these things?” Piers asked. 

“I guess that explains why Councilmember Iwata was always calling them parasites.” Nells added. 

“There is one exception the Spagyric Golem has found, but this might be due to a mutation or other means that went undetected by the Verminaut Bureaucracy.” Mason said. 

Councilmember Sterling scoffed, “Let me guess, our former ‘Ambassador’s pet’ conveniently doesn’t have any.” 

Mason confirming this just seemed to annoy Sterling. 

“Wouldn’t that make the rescue operation that Councilmember Iwata is going on more likely to work? A defector from the Bureaucracy that we can claim died would be a valuable source of information if we have to suddenly treat the Verminauts as a hostile power.” Councilmember Stanford speculated. 

Councilmember Nells spoke next, “We are going to need to prepare for any possible outcomes that arise given the military action we’re about to hear about in the uh, dung system? Do we really not have a better designation than that or alphanumeric gibberish? Really?” 

The Councilmembers started complaining about the name while Mason waited for them to hash it out. 

Mason didn’t care what they called the system, the reason he brought this up was to prepare for any threats that could come up going forward. What was about to happen in that star system was a major threat. 

The Transmuter had been incredibly reckless to go there, but most of the danger was from his daughter being there in the first place, so that didn’t actually change much. 

However with the large-scale military expedition that was going to be in the star system from multiple species, it was a powder keg. 

After the Dirtmen succeeded in taking down the largest Delfovian fleet without a single casualty or escape, the political situation in the galaxy was rapidly shifting, and it seemed like every major power was trying to prove something.  

Relying on the Verminauts was a risky venture, particularly since their entire government was based on some shadowy conspiracy that they didn’t know the full extent of. With a perceived shift of power and massed fleets, it would only take some minor pretext to encourage hostilities. If the Calaxians or even the Grabbun found out about the parasites it would likely trigger a full-scale war. 

One the Council undoubtedly wouldn’t want to be a part of if they could avoid it. 

Councilmember Mason decided to jump in, quelling the arguments about the name of the star system. 

“Getting to the point, we need to prepare for what’s next if we’re to avoid getting caught up in another conflict. I have some areas of research we can pursue given the information the Transmuter passed along before leaving. Whereas I suspect Councilmember Iwata left this with me in case something happened, we really can not afford to wait to be prepared.” 

---

I woke up feeling refreshed. Yesterday had been incredibly nice between doing some last-minute touring and goodbyes of the planet with Scheya and Meadow Muffin in the morning, and then hanging out with Odette all evening at a literal hot spring. 

We then rode back to the ship’s final launch site so we could leave the next day. I may have nodded out during the wagon ride back a few times, but I did remember getting on the ship, entering my cabin, and crawling into my bed on the ship later than planned and falling asleep almost instantly. 

Despite how anxious I had been to leave before, I was going to miss the place. 

I rolled out of bed and started looking for some fresh clothes to wear. Not having to hike across the planet with very little supplies, not knowing if anyone else had made it had sucked just a tiny bit more not being able to enjoy any of the luxuries that were in this cabin. I didn’t really need much, but every piece of fresh fabric I pulled on was something I had really appreciated in the few weeks we had all been reunited. 

 I walked out of the cabin and into the rest of the ship, heading for the mess. 

Odette was already there, but she was slumped over a chair sleeping. She was still in the bathrobe from last night, and she had drooled all over her face. Across from her Scheya was eating breakfast. 

Meadow Muffin and Villi Kersch were not here, so I assumed they must be outside, perhaps waiting for Mica who should be arriving with our final farewell committee shortly before we were to depart. I supposed Odette was waiting for Mica in her own way as well. 

“Good morning!” Scheya said cheerfully between bites of her bowl of cereal. 

I saw one of Odette’s ears perk up and the Listener started stirring with a stretch. 

I couldn’t resist wiping the drool off her face as she woke up. 

“Sleep well?” I asked. 

Whatever attempt at a reply Odette had made was too muddled for my translator to pick up. 

“They’ve been sleeping there since I came out here.” Scheya said, but she was the last person I wanted to hear about sleep from, given that she slept in the middle of the day in addition to at night. 

Odette stretched again and yawned. 

“I told you we should have invited Mica with us.” Odette mumbled. 

“You didn’t even take me.” Scheya pointed out, but it didn’t seem to bother her cheerful mood. 

“Some sounds are not for the many ears.” Odette said reciting some Listener idiom. 

I rolled my eyes. 

“I enjoyed having a night out just the two of us though. I didn’t expect a full spa experience either. Once the Verminauts set up a gate network out here we should visit every so often. They even brushed out my hair after the massage and then there was the hot spring. I can’t believe you got to go twice.” 

I couldn’t resist gushing about it even if Scheya had missed out on going.  Odette had clearly done everything she could have the first time she had gone with Mica too, because she was a great tour guide on top of being good company. For a creature with four ears she seemed to have a lot to talk about when she wanted to. 

“You should come with me and Mica. If you liked last night we have plans to visit more places like that. My treat.” Odette suggested. 

Maybe I wouldn’t be in any real trouble when I got back home. 

“We’ll have to drop back home first. Plus you should totally see what our home world is like first.” 

“That’s where we’re going first right?” Scheya said. 

“Yeah.” I said. We were going to be going home. 

We sat around the table as Scheya finished up her breakfast, and Odette and I fully woke up. Reminiscing about the trip with Odette I felt like it had almost been an adventure. Time slipped us by until Villi Kersch ran into the room with a bag. 

“Hope you have everything packed because the farewell committee is here to see us off.” Villi announced as she pulled some clothing out of the bag and started forcing clothing on Odette under her bathrobe. 

Odette feigned protest but it looked like she was very used to other people dressing her. I wondered what she had promised or paid Villi that the captain was dressing her right now. 

Scheya on the other hand was lost in thought. It was easy to tell because she would absentmindedly touch the velvet on her still growing antlers. 

She startled me by asking me a question suddenly, “Do you think the Wardens got me anything?” 

The wardens, Antyla’s group, were some sort of warrior police or something, even if they didn’t act very professionally in my opinion. I felt a little embarrassed I didn’t fully know the magnitude of their significance to Sellyn culture. I made a mental note to ask Meadow Muffin who had been paying far more attention to cataloging all of that sort of stuff. 

“I don’t know what the custom is.” I shrugged. “Let’s go find out.” 

I led Scheya outside for our goodbyes, and saw the four Sellyn sitting outside next to a wagon. Once they saw us off, we’d have to wait for them to ride to a safer distance before we left. 

Antyla looked fairly stoic, but Kika, Bea, and even Niner looked incredibly sad. Mica sat waiting with them for the rest of us to come out. He looked fairly tired and even a little pale. 

“Where’s Meadow Muffin?” I asked. 

“Went inside to get a gift for the Sellyn.” Mica mused, “Hopefully Odette wasn’t too much trouble?” 

“Hopefully I am exactly the right amount of trouble.” Odette said proudly as she stepped off the ship, with Villi Kersch in tow. She immediately took Mica’s side and coiled her tail around him. 

Villi Kersch must have thought she could get away with mirroring Odette’s behavior, because she took Mica’s other side and slung one of her body length antennae onto Mica. Mica respectfully brushed it away before wrapping his arm around Odette. Villi didn’t seem bothered. 

“So this is some sort of tradition?” I asked. 

Antyla shrugged. “You’re travelers. It is traditional to give things to travelers going on a trip I suppose.” 

What I had seen into the world of the Sellyn was really a tiny glimpse into their society. 

“You’ve really been too kind, hopefully we can repay that kindness.” I said. 

Antyla and her posse turned their heads to face Meadow Muffin who was grappling with what looked like a barrel as she stepped out of the ship’s cargo bay. 

“This one hopes this is adequate.” Meadow Muffin said as she placed the barrel securely in their wagon.

“Is that another barrel of what I think that is?” Mica asked, with a concerned look on his face. 

Villi Kersch smirked, “When we get back on the ship I’ll tell you what our little party bug said about winning over the natives when I asked.” 

“Our turn.” Kika announced as she pulled a large box from the wagon with Niner’s help. 

They seemed to be excited as they opened the box to reveal their presents. 

Starting off with Odette and Mica, they handed them both a small bag. Odette started sniffing at it before showing a toothy grin. I assumed it had to be some sort of food item given her reaction. 

“Just like you asked.” Bea added. 

They turned to Villi Kersch, and handed her a bottle. She nodded back to them as they turned their attention to Meadow Muffin. 

As two of them pulled out a larger object, I realized it was a painting. 

The details on it weren’t drawn by a fine artist however. If I had to guess, a bunch of tiny paws had taken part in what was essentially a fingerpainting of Meadow Muffin. The Sellyn children that Meadow Muffin had been giving rides must have banded together to make a gift of their own for the giant blue and black Verminaut. 

“This one is deeply honored.” Meadow Muffin replied through her voice box, although her elytra twitched for a moment, as if she wanted to chirp with joy. 

Bea pulled out a book next. I could see the eyes of its intended recipient glow with realization. 

“Is that what I think that is?” Scheya said. 

“Sorry, it’s a new one.” Antyla said, “But we think you deserve one.” 

I really needed to get Meadow Muffin or Scheya to explain what the significance was here, but Scheya was crying as she clutched the book. 

Niner looked uncomfortable but Kika stopped her from saying anything for a minute. 

Scheya looked back at the ship and wiped her face as she clutched the book. 

“Please, continue.” Scheya said. 

All four of the Wardens turned to get something out of the box. But instead of something large, each pulled out something in each hand. 

“Is that what I think that is?” I asked. 

They were each holding antlers, one in each hand. 

“Ours, from last year.” Antyla said, as she handed hers over. Mica quickly came over to help me carry them, followed by Odette who awkwardly carried one as well. 

“Thank you.” I said. 

We packed up everything before saying our goodbyes, although I didn’t do most of the talking. After a lengthy group hug and, and watching the Wardens drive their wagon away, I helped Meadow Muffin and Villi Kersch do final checks on the ship, double checking anything that could go wrong. 

Our repairs had left the ship looking a bit banged up, but it was space worthy, and we were finally leaving. Piling onto the ship, I took a place with Meadow Muffin and Villi Kersch on the bridge, while Mica, Odette, and Scheya sat in the mess area next to it in the small ship. 

We started pre-flight checks before taking off, with Villi Kersch piloting us off the planet and onto our next destination.

Jett stared out a window. Or rather, a screen that simulated a window. An actual window would be a structural weakness, but being able to look outside was apparently important regardless. 

They had been unceremoniously picked up and flown into space, and then unceremoniously dumped on a ship.  Mason had sent them some half-hearted messages about having received some answers, but whatever he had figured out wasn’t shared with Giada or Jett. Jett hadn’t been told much at all. For example, the trip was suddenly delayed half a day at the last minute with no indication as to why. 

At least they could piece together the route via the window. The Transmuter had plotted it through the secret Verminaut gate network they had built out to the planet that was their destination. And apparently they were using them without any authorization too, because they were currently waiting on some massive Verminaut battleship to move through the hyperspace gate. As they got closer and closer to their destination there were more of these delays. The implication being that the Verminauts were moving a lot of ships in the same direction they were heading. 

“I thought there weren’t any hyperspace gates this far out. Let alone half the Verminaut fleet using them.” Jett mused, but he was fairly certain that Giada had not heard a single word he said. 

He paced across the corridor aimlessly. Giada sighed like she did anytime someone tried to interrupt her game. “This trip is already taking forever. Do you really want to complain about it going faster?” 

 “What I want to complain about is how we can’t even—” 

Jett stopped abruptly as a Lesser Golem nudged his leg. Or rather, the one he had brought on board. He pulled out a rag and started wiping it down, not that there was any dust or dirt on it or anything else on the ship. The machine pushed against the cloth like it enjoyed the sensation. 

He stopped suddenly when he realized the cloth was damp. 

“How’d you get so wet?”  

Jett pulled the cloth to his face and smelled it. It was faint, like sea water.  And something else. Something he was certain he must have imagined.  

“Are you okay?” Giada asked Jett. 

Giada was standing next to him now, and the game she was playing was nowhere in sight. Giada couldn’t teleport but Jett’s mind was struggling to register what had happened.  

She prompted him further with a “Hello?” before Jett realized he had zoned out. 

Giada looked at Jett with a worried expression even as he looked back. 

“Let’s go to the infirmary, you look like you saw a ghost.” 

Jett readily followed Giada and the Lesser Golem, but something was still bothering him.  

Suddenly Giada stopped, and before Jett could ask why she put a finger to his lips and gestured toward the door she had stopped next to. Jett immediately huddled next to Giada and the door as they both tried to listen. 

There weren’t many options for who they could be eavesdropping on given the ship’s limited crew. 

The two listening were quite skilled at this sort of thing , but they didn’t have to be to make out what was being said. The conversation was quite heated. 

“After you made me keep secrets from both of them? You kept this a secret?” 

There was a pause, perhaps as the person replying to Sela Zuria might have sighed, or wringed their hands, or otherwise ate their discomfort. 

“I was worried about Mica. Worried about—""

“How dare you! You don’t get to worry about my child, about Eben’s child, after you made your own flesh and blood keep a secret like this.” 

The Transmuter paused again before replying to Mica’s mother. 

“You’re right. I have kept far too many secrets from my child. I’ve been far too worried about what revealing everything will do to our relationship that I didn’t stop to think about what this would do to Ruri’s.” 

Jett had to silently hush the Lesser Golem at his feet as it tried to mimic a whimper, and he missed whatever Sela’s reply was. Then he realized why it was acting that way. 

Jett quickly tugged Giada away from the door as the Spagyric Golem trudged up to it. 

There was no point in hiding as it opened the door and went into the room, but the Spagyric Golem seemed to ignore them as it did so. 

Jett pulled Giada further away from the door just the same as they walked further on. 

Giada hissed a question to Jett, “Did you catch that last part?” 

Jett shook his head as they continued to walk away. 

Giada grabbed Jett by the shoulder, “The infirmary is this one.” 

 As they stepped inside, Giada immediately sat down. 

“What did you hear?” 

Giada shrugged. “Do you know anyone named Silica?”  

“No. Should I?” 

“Whoever that person is, they  ’re on this ship.” 

Jett thought for a moment. Someone who the Transmuter made his own daughter keep secret from Mica, and even kept secret from a close friend himself. If they had a lead in front of them, he was going to take it. If nothing else it was better than staring out a window for the rest of the trip. 

“Let’s find this Silica and get some answers.”  

---

“And then Mica immediately challenges me to a best of fifteen like I hadn’t just beaten him at Rock-Paper-Scissors the seven previous times, or every single time I’ve ever played him. At that point it was getting more sad than funny, but I wasn’t about to let him win eight times in a row. Instead I just gave him the candy.”  

Scheya laughed as I finished the story, but that didn’t stop me from noticing Odette poking her head into the room cautiously. 

“You weren’t eavesdropping again, were you?” I asked, “You remember what happened last time, right?” 

Two of Odette’s ears folded back, and her face crinkled into an incredibly sour expression.  

“I wasn’t eavesdropping! I wanted to know if you were still coming today.” 

I smiled at Odette as she waited for her answer. “I’ll be there. Who knows when we’ll be able to come back here.” 

Maybe Meadow Muffin would be able to go back with the Verminauts, and maybe I’d see reports from her about it. Maybe I could even push for more Dirtmen involvement in helping the Sellyn so they wouldn’t be taken advantage of in some way. But I had serious doubts that I’d be involved. 

As Odette looked back at me, her expression softened up. Then her eyes shifted over to Scheya. They weren’t filled with her usual determination, and her ears didn’t appear to be trained on anything in particular. 

Suddenly she blurted out a question to Scheya, “Are you sure you want to leave the planet with us?” 

Scheya looked at Odette with a blank expression, then at me, as if she was asking for help. I couldn’t answer for her, so I shrugged. She thought about it for a while before absentmindedly touching her still growing antlers. 

I was surprised they had grown so fast, particularly this late in what the Sellyn had told me was their season for it. But Scheya took endless amounts of pride in the two growths sprouting from her head. More than the wearable translator I had made for her. The velvet covered antlers were essentially a rite of passage for a young Sellyn, proof that she was an adult with the strength and vitality that were needed to be one. 

I knew what they meant to Scheya, but I had a hard time properly caring. Not because I didn’t care about Scheya, but because growing up was a fuzzy concept for me. I had essentially had to do most of it twice. Growing up was something I watched other people do. 

“Yeah. I’m sure.” Scheya replied finally. 

Looking back at Odette, I could see she was thinking about something, but I wasn’t quite sure what it was. 

I didn’t know why I was the only one who was ready to go back. Scheya might be the first Sellyn to leave her planet, but Odette had actual vacation plans before they had been hijacked by the plans Meadow Muffin and I had to visit this planet. While I was likely to be in a world of trouble when I got back home, Odette would be fine. And yet, Odette seemed reluctant to go back. 

I couldn’t just leave Scheya to ask her, so as Odette turned to leave, I shot a question at her. 

“Is there something bothering you Odette?” 

I could see one of her ears swiveling back and forth as she thought about her answer. Something was bothering her, but she was being as elusive as ever. 

I started to stand up, and Odette must have taken that as a cue to come up with an answer. 

“My plans were interrupted.”

Ultimately that was my fault. Was that what she didn’t want to tell me? Or was she hiding something else? 

“We’ll make new plans. We’re going back home, but when we get there I’m sure you’ll be able to secure another ship and continue with your vacation plans if that’s what you want. And even if I’m never allowed to leave home again, you can visit me anytime.” 

“You won’t be allowed to leave?” Scheya asked, before Odette could reply. 

I shrugged. “I’m going to be in a lot of trouble  for coming here, I can just feel it. But that’s not the worst thing in the world, or uh, galaxy.” 

“I’m going to make a lot of trouble at anyone mad at you for coming here.” Odette said. 

“Me too.” Scheya added. 

I smiled at the thought of the two being a menace because they didn’t get their way. I would be sure to tell them it was going to be okay later, but for now I just enjoyed the two coming to my defense. 

“Thanks everyone.”

A coalition of unlikely allies  gathered at a staging point in the void of space, just a hop away from their destination. It had taken quite some time given that the Verminauts were the only ones with hyperspace gates in this part of space, even if they would probably deny their existence. It didn’t help that the participating parties had started by censuring the Verminauts for their actions in this part of space so far.

Because the coalition had formed as part of a non-binding resolution at the Galactic Moot, there were a few neutral and third-party observers at the staging point, but none of them would be jumping in for the action. This included field reporters from the Kienyoo news organization, Web of News.  

News might travel faster than ship travel did, but due to the nature of the mission they were prohibited from reporting on anything until the action started. Given that they wouldn’t be able to see or hear anything happening in the target system, it might have felt like a pointless exercise, but Joth wasn’t particularly interested in sanitized news about blowing something up. Most viewers would tune away from that. 

Joth was here to conduct some interviews, but so far they had been incredibly boring. Maybe it was all the time he had spent with the Dirtmen over the last year. Or maybe it was because everyone he had talked to was some handpicked lackey so far. 

The last interview he held was the worst. It was some shelled up Grabbun commandant named Paralith more interested in repeating talking points than answering even the safest of questions. Between every question the Grabbun would drink brine. Brine. What kind of Grabbun drank brine at an interview before a fight? It had taken every hair on Joth’s four hands to not storm out of the sham of an interview. 

Even if Joth didn’t consider himself a serious journalist most of the time, he did have limits to what he could deal with.  

Joth pulled up his data pad and went through the list of who had officially sent ships for this fleet. The forces each sent varied, but it was an absurdly sized subjugation fleet by any measure. Some species had only really sent ships, to be crewed by others, like the dozens of Kelphonian merchants that kept trying to get Joth to advertise their wares in the guise of some interview. 

Joth sighed then went over the checklist of different individuals he had interviewed who were on the list. He had already interviewed the Grabbun, dozens of Calaxians of every feather, an annoying Helix Screw, several Zaklug mercenaries, a stack of Ka. That just left one choice for the next interview. 

Four of the support staff had their pictures flash across his data pad one after another. They were all part of a team sent to help with last-minute maintenance and readiness. A Tetwarrdian pod, which in typical fashion would be a group interview. 

Weighing his options Joth remembered why this interview was on the bottom of the list. Actually he wondered how they got on the list over any of the Kelphonian merchants. He’d rather do a sponsored segment that nobody would watch than suffer through an interview with some Tetwarrdians. 

Most species didn’t have to deal with the way Tetwarrdians looked at a Kienyoo’s four arms, being fellow members of an ever-exclusive club with that feature. It wasn’t Joth’s fault the Kienyoo didn’t also share the absurd gender skews that most species had. Maybe that’s why the Dirtmen were so nice to be around. They might have a skewed population, but it was the result of their recent pre-interstellar conflict with the Delfovians. And they could keep their hands to themselves. 

Why couldn’t this coalition have recruited some Nimeccu instead? At least that would have made for an interesting interview for the indignity Joth would have to deal with. But Joth remembered their official excuse for turning down the call was having already sent a large force to help the Dirtmen manage their Delfovian prisoner problems. That was a snapped web of a statement, since the Nimeccu always tried to keep relations between both the Verminauts and the Grabbun in a weird balancing act, and this was just their latest excuse for not putting one before the other. 

Thinking about the interviews so far, Joth grumbled a bit and started writing a message to the Tetwarrdians he was supposed to interview. 

He cursed when he got a near instant reply. 

They were about to go on a meal break and invited him to join them. And since they were support staff, they were on the vessel he was on right now. There was no backing out now. 

Soon, sooner than Joth would have liked, he was sharing a meal with four others, who were looking at him like he was the meal. 

It was uncomfortable at best. Joth wasn’t particularly hungry, and figured he would focus on the story. 

“So do you have any thoughts about the upcoming action?” 

“Nope.” “Not at all.” “Don’t care.” “We’re not going.” 

Four answers all at once, and Joth’s translator struggled to keep up. He certainly had no idea who said what. 

“You’ve been working on many of the systems that will be used though, you don’t have any thoughts about them?” 

“None we can talk about.”

Just one reply. From their leader. Joth swiped through his files, trying to see if there was anything else or if this was just a dead end. 

Something popped up that hardly seemed relevant. But if Joth knew anything about his time interviewing Dirtmen, this was something. 

“Maybe you could talk about the incident with the Dirtmen support staff instead? I heard reports there is still a faulty airlock that caused issues during the lasted Moot.”  

Joth saw guilty expressions surrounding him. He had struck a weak point. He just needed to keep picking at it. 

“It really is a shame we don’t have anything newsworthy here to cover, but Web of News always has older interest stories to cover. Like the mysterious debris that was floating outside the Station of Understanding after the Dirtmen had arrived. My viewers absolutely adore any stories about the Dirtmen you see.” 

“I told you this interview was a bad idea.” “No, you told me you wanted to ogle the reporter while we ate.” 

The arguing wasn’t as overwhelming this time. 

“Alright Joth, but you didn’t hear anything from us.” 

“Anonymous sources just add to the mystery.” Joth said with a smile. His viewers didn’t expect him to be a serious journalist, so he didn’t need to worry about the stringent standards of one either. 

It was hard to keep up as they gossiped like a bunch of children. 

Joth did his best not to zone out as they complained about various Grabbun and Calaxian demands and how ridiculous they were. They went into various minutia about how each different boss smelled. Then they started to spin a story that would make Joth’s coworkers jealous. 

“It is as if they’re all trying to one up each other.” “Each weapon system we install is some experimental package.” “We’ve installed enough munitions and platforms to wipe a continent off a planet.” “Have you ever seen a Grabbun slap their claws against something with pride? Now imagine seeing a squad of them do that.” 

Trying to ask a clarifying question, Joth tried to interject into the stampede of words in the air, “What kind of weapons—” 

“Guns, lots of guns.” “Missiles. Missiles that shoot missiles. And those shoot tiny missiles.” 

The two that mentioned these nodded in agreement, before the other two started talking. 

“Particle beam cannons. I think. Maybe they’re just normal beams? They don’t shoot cannons.” “Lasers. They even have a turbo.” “Lasers are just particle beams that shoot photons!” “They don’t shoot cannons though.” 

It was an argument and the other two stepped in. To argue more. 

“Why would you shoot cannons?” “Firing photons is not a particle beam. Do you think the lights are particle beams?” “I know they don’t shoot cannons, but I wanted to make it clear.” “We’ve been over this; photons are also considered a particle!” “It was clear, Joth isn’t stupid.” “You probably do. Are you sure you were installing weapons platforms or changing out lights?” “Joth we don’t think you’re stupid, we just wanted to make sure it was clear.” “This is why I keep hearing jokes about how many of us it takes to change a light array. Way to play the stereotype.”  

Joth felt the hairs on his arms starting to twitch from all the excess sound. 

“Please, can we just talk one at a time?’ 

This got the group to stop for a moment. 

Before they could all burst into another cacophony of noise Joth pointed at one of them at random. 

“You. Speak.” 

He hoped they didn’t realize he had no idea what their names were with his growing headache. 

“Uh. Um. Basically we’ve been installing weapons systems non-stop. It’s like this is a giant weapons test. And uh—”

Joth pointed at the next one. Luckily it seemed to be working because there was a shriek between the two. Joth had no idea where his boldness had come from, but it reminded him of a Dirtmen teacher he had seen once. It was downright rude but it was working. 

“Yes. Everything we’re installing is either really new, or mounds and mounds of old stuff being taken out of storage to use it up. Lots of it.” 

They seemed to be ready for Joth to move on, and the next one seemed to be ready to start talking, because there was only a short pause this time. 

“It really doesn’t make any sense for anything but proving a point, because there is enough here to blow up the largest capital ship on record. Like a couple times. Which is weird because—” 

Joth thought he moved his finger too fast but the next one picked up the sentence. 

“Because the Giga Extro Karkin is part of this fleet.”

It turns out this interview, or whatever it could be called, was a good idea after all. He hadn’t seen that ship in any of the press materials. If anything, its location was typically classified and knowing its location would be a headline in itself. 

Why would they need all the extra firepower if the Grabbun flagship was here? Using hyperspace to jump into a system that far from usable gates with your most important asset was reckless, even for the Grabbun. Were they trying to show up the Calaxians? Or did they expect the Verminauts to show up with more ships to try to stop them?

Review of the Faction's power in the Deadfire (PoE2 Endgame Spoilers),projecteternity,1hmu5l7,2024-12-26 13:10:58,38,0.91,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/projecteternity/comments/1hmu5l7/review_of_the_factions_power_in_the_deadfire_poe2/,Roharu_Eruna,Spoilers,"I recently finished the game and I would like to share my thoughts and review of each of the four factions you can join in the game. I am not here to decide which is the 'best' but rather, state their power and dominion over the Deadfire and more of less determined who is the faction with the greatest potential to triumph if neither the Watcher or Eothas interfered. This is also based on interpretation and my perspective, so feel free to discuss if you disagree with anything.

There are a few rules though:

1. I am not counting the Ancient Huana, because they are objectively the most powerful faction of all, capable to reshape the entire continent without the need of dragons or other sources of energy. Plus, they had Ukaizo, so, I won't use their feats to powerscale the current Huana either.
2. I am not taking their full military power from their respective homeland. Neither Rauatai nor the Vallian Company could afford to transport all of their resources to the Deadfire anyways. I am just counting their power and presence currently in the Deadfire.
3. I will divide the review in three sections: Military Presence, Triumph cards and Leaders.

I. Military Presence (from weakest to strongest)

Fourth >> Huana: Sadly for the Huana, their faction is everywhere and can outnumber every other faction, but most of them are so unprotected they are easy pickings. Tikiwara is a great example of it. Most of their forces are just scattered, so their only two powerful strongholds are Neketaka and the Wahaki's homeland. Both of which are isolated from the rest of the Huana tribes.

Third >> Vallian Trading Company: If we are talking resources, Vallian easily outspeeds and outspace all other faction thanks to their accelerated expansion. However, their military power leaves much to be desired. The fact that they didn't care that two noble families (Valera or Bardatto) that were actively chasing down the pirates of the Deadfire were killing each other is a huge blindspot on their part.

Second >> Royal Deadfire Company: With so many strongholds, cannons, walls, ships and their constant innovation in weaponry, this faction really can turn the whole Deadfire into a warzone. There is no much to tell really, if you visit Sakuya or Hasongo, you can picture just how strong this faction is, and efficient too! These people were already in Crookspur the second you finish your mission.

First >> Príncipi sen Patrena: Now, this is a very large and powerful faction in terms of military presence, and in my opinion, the strongest in the Deadfire. These guys were EVERYWHERE! Infiltrated and backstabbing Vallian's captians, smuggling Rauatai's weapons and armament, making deals with Huana's watershapers, even if you backstabbed them in the Endgame, their fleet is still there, fighting whoever faction you picked to reach Ukaizo.

II. Trump cards (elements that can win the war and turn the side of battle. From weakest of strongest)

Fourth >> Príncipi sen Patrena: The strongest in military presence, but really, that's about it. Their Trump card is basically their versatility. They can become whatever they need to survive and thrive in the deadfire. Smugglers, killers, hunters, slavers, anything that gives them position and power.

Third >> Royal Deadfire Company: Despite all their innovations, I didn't see anything truly worth it of being a Trump card exactly. They can be very creative with their weaponry and spy network. They kill their targets very efficiently and can get away with it.

Second >> Valian Company: Perhaps I am being generous, but Animancy truly is worth it of being called a Trump Card. We know how powerful they can be, and even the Gods are wary of their potential. We know from PoE1 how useful it is to construct systems and golems. Put those in the war for the Deadfire, and even the Rauatai will be beaten.

First >> Huana: Weakest military presence, but those Watershapers!! We know how destructive and powerful they are, easily being able to defeat the Royal Deadfire's cannons and warships when they are reaching their coasts, even in their weakened state. Concentrate their masters in one battle field, and they can manipulate even the strongest of storms, storms that even the Rauatai aren't able to tame.

III. Leadership (From weakest to strongest)

Fourth >> Furrante and Aldys: This is the biggest letdown of all. The Principi has the strongest military presence everwhere in the Deadfire.... and also has the weakest and dumbest leadership of all factions. Their forces are divided and both are more than happy to kill the other half just to take control. Sure, Furrante is incredibly cunning and smart, but Aldys still managed to consolidate her position. If the Principi had a true leadership willing to compromise and grow stronger, the Deadfire would already be ruled by Pirates by the time the Watcher visited.

Third >> Director Ignato Castol: He is actually a very important individual with great ambitions and a good eye for priorities. He was doing a literal speedrun in collecting all the resources in the Deadfire and freaking winning! But he lacked control over his own people and military thinking, trusting and becoming allies with Furrante is also a huge red flag in how he is lacking cunning! Furrante would have eaten him whole! From a scientist deserting him, to two noble family squabbling, working with slavers... he couldn't adapt to the strategies of his enemies and depended on outside help to keep his shareholders happy...

Second >> Hazanui Karū and Atsura: Honestly, it is a tossed up between them and the Huana, so feel free to disagree on this. The Admiral truly is a competent individual, identifying talent, poaching talent, 'domesticating' Huana. His network of spies and information gathering are certainly a great. Even when dealing with Pirates, he does it with full understanding of the risks and rarely gives them freedom at all or openly makes deals as ridiculous as Director Ignato with them.

First >> Queen Onekaza II: I am a sucker for royalties that are actually smart! So many times we know how entittled and dumb kings or queens can be, so it really is great to see a monarch that is actually good at ruling. The Queen had full diplomatic control over both trading companies, but she was limited by the military presence left behind by the previous queen and the tradition of her people (when we talked about the Roparu, she admits she wishes to help, but the Caste system is limiting her actions. Going against the traditions is going against her people's wishes). Still, even with only a handful of Watershapers, she managed to limit the impact of both trading companies for years. She is still losing, of course, but her intellect cannot be denied. When Hazanui Karu deemed it necessary to kill her outright rather than continue in other 'fairer' ways, well, it speaks volume of how much of a thorn Onekaza II was for them.

All in all, the biggest potential was the Príncipi sen Patrena. If only they had an actual leader, or if they could let the Watcher become their new leader, I am certain they could conquer the Deadfire. If you ruled the seas, you ruled the continent. Sadly, not such an option, and so, I believe they are the weakest faction before the Watcher comes in.

The Vallian Company is next, and truthfully, if Director Ignato could have been a bit more competent in warfare rather than just generating profit, this company could have easily conquer the Deadfire. Even the assassinations of the Royal Deadfire Company could barely slow them down. He was smart and had all the power needed to win, but he was playing the wrong game.

The Huana have the potential to become the strongest, no doubt. But they were so far away from each other, and the sins of their pasts and traditions were slowly devouring them all. They are a good example of having a 'bad hand' right from the get go. A more concentrated Huana would have sink all other factions with ease, but their isolated nature and lack of communication was their downfall. Regardless of the Queen's actions, even she cannot change that.

And so, the strongest faction, in my humble opinion, before the Watcher came in, is the Royal Deadfire Company! I hate them, I really, really do, but their military presence, efficiency and leadership skills cannot be denied. They were more than willing to win by killing everything and everyone, and transform them into whatever they wished... And they had the power to do just that.... It is a terrifying thought, but in the long run, the second they had the upper hand (which they will), the Deadfire will literally be on fire, and the Royal Deadfire will be there, at the top of a mountain of corpses and ashes, with a flag standing proud declaring Victory."
Room build,audiophile,1hm2fkz,2024-12-25 10:13:56,758,0.98,135,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hm2fkz,R300Muu,Show & Tell,"Lots of people asked to see the build of the room so here it is. I'll try to put in as much detail as possible, and explain some of the design compromises made along the way. 

1- Front stage planning, laser showing where the front wall would go. Yes I could have done soffit mounted L&R but while I could do the DIY the budget would be shattered in Genelec land, but did consider dynaudio core 59.

2- Walls and ceiling are double plasterboard with tecsound between the sheets. Right hand wall is double offset studs. All cabling is tied to metal trays and runs in ceiling. 

3- Bedroom above floor: layup is double plasterboard, tecsound, 100mm rockwool, 5mm rubber to float floor, 25mm thick cement impregnated floor (very heavy), acoustic sealing at edge, soundmat underlay, carpet. I forgot how much work went in here but it enables me to use the system at night.

4- Front wall build up with cables

5- Rockwool in, 50mm deep across middle, side traps are 700 wide, 400 deep, 2400 high.

6- Covered to keep fibres in

7- First look at the front

8- Signal sends from rack location + GLM network

9- Overhead mounts & loom

10- Getting the rear panels in 6"" deep and bass traps on floor

11- Some pre treatment sweeps with REW

12- Today. Speaker placement are all in spec, just about, but concessions made in seating position as middle of the room silly but also did want space behind me. You can see why 5.x is a better fit than 7.x for my room, plus really most things are either 5.1 Or Atmos

13- Back end, shows the L shape but after many many many hours in CAD this was the best use of the space as I saw it. 

Things I didn't do: panels on the ceiling, it was already looking pretty extreme and I wasn't dealing with issues there. Second sub, it really isn't needed when you get the placement right and tame it with DSP. Simplicity was my friend here."
Das große Vergessen - aus meiner Scifi Serie,schreiben,1hjwim5,2024-12-22 06:10:54,6,0.88,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/schreiben/comments/1hjwim5/das_große_vergessen_aus_meiner_scifi_serie/,Annual-Confidence-64,Kurzgeschichten,"Es wurde gekündigt. Die große Auslöschung und Vergessenheit hat nun auch Syrien getroffen.

Vor einigen Monaten hatte das Verschwinden Palästinas aus der digitalen Welt alle überrascht. Die Menschen waren verlegen und entzweit. Zwischen Bewunderung für die technologischen Möglichkeiten und Empörung über die Auslöschung der Geschichte eines Volkes.  

Alle bewunderten Londsdale Thiel - so hieß die KI zu Ehren ihres Schöpfers. Die KI war in der Lage, die Auslöschung auf der ganzen Welt gleichzeitig durchzuführen. Im globalen Netz, in den Air Gap Networks, in den privaten Servern der Data Hoarder, ja sogar in den digitalen und analogen Staatsarchiven. All dies mit Hilfe von koordinierten und hochkomplexen Angriffsvektoren des Cyberwar, Social Engineering und Präzisionswaffen. Verschwörungstheoretiker sprachen von einem geheimen Demenz-Virus, der Omas und Opas in die Verzweiflung trieb und ihre traurigen Geschichten von Völkermord und Golems in Wortsalat verwandelte.

Die Palästinenser hatten keine Geschichte mehr, keine Präsenz, keine Zukunft. Das Land und ihre Menschen dürften nicht mehr erwähnt werden, weder in Büchern noch in den Nachrichten. Das Konzept Palästina war ausgelöscht, aus der Realität getilgt und als unwahr abgestempelt. Jede Behauptung über die Existenz Palästinas wurde kriminalisiert und als Virus in allen digitalen Speichern klassifiziert.

Es hieß, die Welt und die USA seien sicherer, friedlicher geworden. Die Auslöschung des kollektiven Gedächtnisses ist humaner als die Auslöschung des Individuums. Gewalt auf individueller Ebene war die Methode unzivilisierter Zeiten. Londsdale Thiel und sein Vorgänger Palantir hatten gelernt, dass nicht das Individuum, sondern seine Netzwerke neutralisiert werden müssen. Vor 100 Jahren hatte das auch ein deutscher Geheimdienst versucht, aber der Stasi fehlten das Wissen und die technischen Möglichkeiten.  

Natürlich hatte Londsdale Thiel von der beschleunigten Digitalisierung des kollektiven menschlichen Gedächtnisses profitiert. An seine Stelle traten Datenbanken und die unfehlbare Präzision künstlicher Intelligenz. Die Fäden des Wissens, die einst von Menschen gesponnen worden waren, wurden zur Domäne digitaler Konstruktionen.

Es begann vor 50 Jahren mit dem Aufkommen von sozialen Netzwerken und Cloud-Anbietern. Man sprach von den Moor’schen Gesetzen und anderen Prinzipien der technologischen Beschleunigung. Zuerst wurden Fotos, Karten, Fakten und Algorithmen des täglichen Lebens in die Obhut von Siliziumchips gegeben. Nach und nach wurde uns die Last des Erinnerns abgenommen. Wir mussten uns keine Geburtstage mehr merken, keine Adressen im Kopf behalten - unser Leben war sicher in der Cloud gespeichert.

Was in Palästina geschah, und in Syrien geschehen wird, lässt nicht nur Kollektive, sondern auch Individuen vor dem drohenden Abgrund des Vergessens erschaudern.

Der Gedanke, die fein gezeichneten Landkarten des Wissens zu verlieren, die in Jahrtausenden menschlicher Erfahrung entstanden sind, erfüllt sie mit Sorge. Die Gesichter, die ich einst erkannte, die Worte, die ich mir merken konnte, das Wissen und die Techniken, die ich beherrschte - all diese Anker, die mir halfen, mich im dichten Dschungel des Lebens zurechtzufinden, drohen plötzlich weggespült zu werden. Meine Erinnerungen, einst mein Kompass in einer Welt voller Verbündeter und Gegner, sind verloren. Vergessen.

Und so stehe ich hier, am Rande dieses vergesslichen Zeitalters – des Zeitalters des Großen Vergessens. Eine Realität, die ein Versprechen von ewigen Frieden in sich trägt, so beängstigend wie aufregend.

Während ich auf mein Handy schaue, frage ich mich unweigerlich, ob ich meine Erlebnisse in irgendeiner Form speichern und aufbewahren möchte. In meiner Haut? In einer geheimen Hülle? Mich analogisieren und mich der Analog-Revolutionären anschließen?

Werde ich meinen Blick von diesem Bildschirm abwenden können, wenn mein Sohn zur Welt kommt? Werde ich die Freude in den Augen meiner Frau wirklich erleben können, ohne das nagende Verlangen, diesen Moment festzuhalten, zu dokumentieren, in irgendeiner von KI organisierten Datenbank zu verewigen, zu löschen, politisch korrekt zu rekonstruieren oder wahrheitsgetreu abzurufen? Werde ich den Klang eines echten Lachens hören oder ein von KI in Echtzeit konstruiertes Lachen? Werde ich meinem Sohn diese zeitlosen Geschichten erzählen können, ohne von einer KI in Echtzeit in Frage gestellt zu werden? Werde ich meine eigenen Lügen wählen können? Meine eigenen Illusionen?

Das ist der Kern meines Dilemmas, meiner Zerrissenheit angesichts des Großen Vergessens. Wie finde ich meinen Weg in einer Welt, in der die Erinnerungen nicht mehr in uns leben, sondern außerhalb von uns aufbewahrt werden? Und dann im Namen des Friedens und der kollektiven Sicherheit ausgelöscht werden?

Während sich die KI immer mehr auf die unerbittliche Wahrheit spezialisiert und jede Tatsache, die die Wahrheit ist, mit absoluter Präzision digital speichert oder politisch korrekt rekonstruiert, beginnen die Analog-Revolutionäre über die Wiederbelebung der mündlichen Überlieferung nachzudenken.

Vielleicht werden sich die Menschen wieder für das Zeitalter der Mythen und Legenden interessieren, für antike Göttergeschichten und andere fantastische Erzählungen, für Fabeln und Gleichnisse, für die Kunst. Dafür kämpfen die Analog-Revolutionäre.

Ich kritzle diese Zeilen in meine Hölle und lausche den Drones über mir. Londsdale Thiel kennt meine Absichten aus meinem Verhalten. Scheiße ... ich werde jetzt Analog. Tot."

Contributions from u/willboss27 marked with an asterisk. If you haven't read Parts 1 & 2, I'd recommend doing so for full context. Now let's dive into books 16-18. Enjoy!

**Book 16: Realms Unknown**

Main Villain: Dagmar (OC)

Set during September 2022. The plot of this book is two-fold. The central plot opens with Skulduggery and Valkyrie racing to save Creyfon Signate from certain death but are too late to stop Signate being slain by a man wearing a Dire Dimension uniform. Signate's demise is the newest in a spate of murders, all victims being Dimensional Shunters. Not long after, they are invited over by Ragner to the Dire Dimension to oversee increased security installments for Quietus' coffin prison. Here we get our first taste of the Dire Dimension, its gloomy atmosphere, blackened sky, towering walls, medieval décor. We meet Hela, a girl around Valkyrie's age assigned to be her guide and the governing Archons who rule after deposing Quietus. During the meetings however, a group of Dire marauders attack and steal Quietus' coffin, among them Ragner's brutish brother Jagett and led by Dagmar, a formidable warrioress. Hela, revealed to be in league with the marauders, knocks out Valkyrie and joins her confederates as they flee with their prize. Skulduggery figures out that the Shunter murders were to cut off any chance of accurately pursuing them through realities. With the dimensional trace on the coffin fading, Skulduggery quickly rallies a team together to chase after them.

The team includes Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Ragner and Freyja, a noble warrioress of Gaunt. Joining them is Peccant, a scholar familiar with Rebus Arcanum's 'Realms Unknown' book on the dimensional network and like his brother, magically ambidextrous, equal parts Elemental and Signum Linguist. Sixth is Carver Gallant, a Shieldmaker and Watchguard mage, overseeing diplomacy so they don't spark an interdimensional war. Seventh is Confelicity Divine, a clever Technomage, Vitakinetic and Alchemist\* who monitors the portal mechanism and acts as company healer. Eighth for his knowledge of the Dead Dimensions is glaive-wielding Necromancer Uriah Serrate who we'll have met at the end of Nemesis and I've made Militsa's mentor. Ninth is Leto, a vampire and emissary of the Fangs. Originally, it was Erradin Tomb for the added bonus of his bromance with Ragner but Tomb is unkillable and needs to stay in the Prime Universe so the natural order of death proceeds smoothly. Even with portal tech, they'll need a Shunter to direct the machine and there's only one left: the tenth and final team member, Silas Nadir. Visiting his cell in the \*underwater Depths, they strike another bargain with him, agreeing to hook him back up to Hammer Lane if he's their Shunter and gives them no trouble. Nadir, whose time in the Depths has been grisly\*, agrees. 

The team tracks the Dire folk through different dimensions, some mentioned before, others of my own invention. These include the Leibniz Universe reeling from the draugr apocalypse; the reality where Roarhaven City was constructed now occupied by frenzied creatures; a Dead Dimension where only Skulduggery and Leto won't need necronaut suits to survive; the empty white void where the entity from *Theatre Of Shadows* dwells; an underground cavern complex where the razorworms roam; a reality where they find long-lost scholar Rebus Arcanum and one where Crengarrions wiped out humanity and established a kingdom of magical creatures, including Springheeled Jack's species, 'Fleetfoots'. Some of these can double up for pacing purposes, e.g Arcanum can be a Crenga prisoner or a denizen in the Dead Dimensions. For every dimension that gets visited, either a Dire folk or team member dies or suffers grievous injury to keep stakes high and momentum strong. The only one neither team visits is the Faceless Ones', not willing to risk encountering the Dark Gods or Darquesse.

Ten main characters might be a tall order, especially when half of them aren't even fan favourites but the travel time will be full of character-building. Talking with Serrate will show Valkyrie hasn't forgotten about Militsa or even Wreath and Melancholia, we'll learn about why Peccant flew under the radar and Ragner's talk of the Dire Dimension's emphasis on family clans will spur Peccant to discuss his kinship with Skulduggery, leading to some reconciliation. Even Nadir might get some backstory on why he's such a sicko. Ragner becomes romantically entangled with Confelicity because that is a power couple right there. As for the villains, the Dire marauders will number seven - the Seven Spears, an elite task force of Quietus' best soldiers - and we'll see what magic Dire dwellers wield. Dagmar leads, Jagett is her lieutenant, Hela is the youngest usually tasked with guarding the coffin and there'll be four others, two men and two women, to make up the numbers.

Not making it out alive are Freyja who bravely dies in single combat to Dagmar even after being weakened by the white-skinned man's bug horde; Serrate whose necronaut suit gets sabotaged in a sequence where the two factions battle in a zero-gravity Dead Dimension for possession of the coffin, leading him to drift endlessly as a corpse; Leto whose serum supply will be destroyed and throws herself at her enemies as a distraction; Nadir who'll backstab Valkyrie the first chance he gets in the finale, not believing their bargain will be honoured and fearing returning to the Depths but is torn apart by feral Crengas; and Peccant, who sacrifices himself to save his brother from Dagmar and uses his dying words to beseech Skulduggery, the last of the line, to reclaim his crest. The final battle will be back on Gaunt in the Dire Dimension in a stronghold of Quietus' loyalists. Of the Seven Spears, only Jagett and Hela survive - Valkyrie and Hela scrap but Hela escapes and Ragner beats Jagett as he did in the Arena of Blood when they were younger but can't bring himself to finish off his brother. Dagmar is killed by Skulduggery but before dying, breaks the final seal chaining Quietus' coffin and the Tyrant of Gaunt is free again. The remaining Skulduggery, Valkyrie, Ragner, Carver and Confelicity escape but even when the Archons and Sanctuaries are informed, Quietus' freedom makes an interdimensional war on the horizon inevitable. Skulduggery offers Valkyrie to join him as he goes to visit his family crypt, to visit his brother's grave and reclaim the crest at last.

During all this, a secondary plot back in our own dimension stars Tanith, now an Arbiter. We'll get a more nuanced insight into how magic being common knowledge is affecting mortals and sorcerers now we've moved past the adrenaline of *Nemesis*. Tanith's introduction in the book will be her foiling some mortals stringing up a mage to burn them like a witch. When she confers with Commander Rylent, we meet the new Council of Elders - Grand Mage Sturmun Drang, Elder Sigrid 'Grid' Aegis a benevolent Faceless Ones worshipper and advocate for the maligned and thirdly, Aldous Quiddling, head of the Watchguard. Attending the meeting is Donald Rafferty, mortal liaison who acts as the face and mouthpiece for issues plaguing the mortal side of things. They also touch on Drang, a German being in charge of Ireland, but Drang will rebuff with him claiming better knowledge than anyone on account of him being China's Advisor and a part of him that maybe relishes the challenge of ruling an unruly Cradle.

When Tanith attends a party thrown to improve mage-mortal relations, she reunites with Dusk, finally an Arbiter, and Serpine who relishes in the fame and accolades from defending the Humdrums. The party is bombed, however, and Tanith and Dusk get paired up to investigate the culprits. They trace the bomb to the somewhat rubbish anti-mortal group the Order of the Ancients and then to the more hardcore Soldiers of Magic. A bored Serpine tags along. Hanging around with these two can lead to a poignant moment where Tanith recalls Sanguine, proof that even the seemingly worst enemies can change over time. (And while I'm not committed to this, maybe a tease for Tanith x Serpine?). Dusk's desire to become an Arbiter is rooted in wanting to foster a truce between the Exiled and the rule-following 'Cardinal' vampires. The investigation brings them into Reign's criminal crosshairs as he's been supplying the Soldiers with armaments and Splash stash. 

The Soldiers' ringleaders are: Isara - yes, that Isara - the mastermind vampire supremacist that Dusk is determined to bring down. The two have a rich, bloodied history, Isara hates Dusk for not preventing Caelan from killing Hrishi and for breaking the code, Dusk hates Isara for her ambition and hypocrisy. Rubedo Fiendish is the masked Red Cleaver trying to spark a Cleaver-Ripper rebellion against the Sanctuary's brainwashing techniques - Tanith's investigations lead to more insight into the Crucible and Cleaver training. Third is a Child of the Spider called The Theurge, rallying the last vestiges of the Spiderlings to the Soldiers' banner. Their transport is the tunneller runt from the start of Resurrection, Marius Dredge. At some point, Dusk is caught in a bomb blast from a knockoff Desolation Engine, part of another Soldier scheme, and returns to the Fangs to heal. Ambrose Trocar, notorious vampire killer, is hired to take out Dusk personally but Dusk slays Trocar first. Also joining the Arbiters is ex-Cleaver Perseus Persevere, underground arena champion Hydra Feign and rogue Child of the Spider Silk who have links to Rubedo, Isara and the Theurge respectively.

After the Soldiers' attacks are continually thwarted and supplies cut off when Reign's criminal empire is brought to a standstill, their last resort is to steal the coffin containing Gog Magog and unleash him to spark as much chaos as possible. The Arbiters, accompanied by a group of Rafferty's best mortal soldiers, intercept the Soldiers before the coffin is breached and defeat them - Perseus gets his revenge on the Red Cleaver after a wicked duel, The Theurge-spider is beheaded and Isara is in shackles. The mage-mortal collaboration here is another step in improving relations between the two. However, the coffin is gone, dragged underground by the slippery Dredge.

Omen will be absent in this book...or will he? Because finally making his debut is Sebastian Tao! I found Sebastian's story dragged out over six books, especially once Darquesse was brought back, so copying the same beats but over nine books would be even worse. So Sebastian pops into existence here and because this book takes place over a couple of months, both his actions during Resurrection/Midnight are covered here and hopefully much of the fat will be trimmed from Sebastian's story by condensing it into a trilogy. Yes, Sebastian will still be Omen from the future and his aim will still be to bring back Darquesse but the conclusion of his mission is quite different. We won't know he's Omen beneath the mask until Book 18.

Notable Deaths: Uther Peccant, Silas Nadir, Uriah Serrate, Christopher Reign, Acantha, Creyfon Signate, Rebus Arcanum. OCs: Leto, Freyja, Dagmar, Rubedo Fiendish, The Theurge.

**Book 17: Gods And Monsters**

Main Villain: Quietus

Set in February 2023, a few months after Realms Unknown. This book covers the interdimensional war against the Dire Dimension. Quietus, the Tyrant of Gaunt, leads a series of attacks at key strategic points in our reality while the combined forces of the Sanctuaries, assorted allies and mortals, defend and plan counterattacks. In the absence of Shunters, these crossovers are engineered by either the magical lattices we saw during the coffin swap in UTE or Teleporter-Isthmus Anchor combinations. Now the mortals are aware of magic, Quietus' invasion will hold no quarter and be even more destructive - By book's end, Earth will be a ruined, hellish, apocalyptic wasteland. Entire capital cities will be levelled and razed. Several Sanctuaries around the world feature in these epic action sequences battles and ideally the same scale that LSODM achieved with its war will be matched here with all the featuring Elders and Sanctuary personnel.

We witness more of how the Dire people, or Gaunts do battle too. \*The Dire Dimension’s magic isn’t necessarily more powerful, but it’s more brutal. More overwhelming. They’re constantly at war and there’s constant infighting “the weak don’t deserve to live” sort of thing. Most sorcerers have known War and adapted to it, but the populace of the Dire Dimension were born into it.\* Boosts in strength and speed, shamans with unstable primal attacks and 'Nulls' possessing anti-magic shields and holy smites temporarily nullifying a sorcerer's power. Among Quietus' ranks will be his loyal but despised son Jagget and an inner circle of five generals - called the Crimson Fist - released from a Gaunt prison by Quietus during the first act, including Arvarad, Quietus' oldest friend. They massacre the Archons, reclaiming sovereignty over Gaunt. Apart from his Dire soldiers, Quietus' army has towering brutish Bugbears, swarms of fiery demons forged from the elements and regiments of wyverns, each winged beast helmed by a rider. Quietus himself rides a wyvern during several battles, wearing armour and wielding sword and shield, all forged from the Void meteorite from which the Obsidian Blade was plucked.

Preparing for the war, Skulduggery and Valkyrie build an army - other than the Sanctuary and mortal armies, they recruit the Monster Hunters, Dai Maybury, Trebuchet, the remaining Unveiled, the Necromancer Temples and even Children of the Spider. With Dusk's help, the Exiled vampires and the 'Cardinal' vampires truce. Tanith enlists the Knives in the Darkness, including her brother. Meritorious and the Leibniz Alliance pledge their support. Omen Darkly rejoins the fight, the Obsidian Blade a heavy-hitting weapon he relinquishes to the Arbiters. Serpine is reinstated as a General. The Sanctuary's top scientists Destrier and Confelicity work overtime on techno-magic for the war effort, mass producing binding guns and stun/kill lasers. The Witches will be treated with but with the Brides massacred and the Maidens cowardly, only the Crones of the Cold Embrace join as do several Warlock groups. Roarhaven goes under martial law and Corrival Academy becomes a training ground for soldiers. Best of all, Scapegrace, Thrasher and Clarabelle return! Scapegrace is approached to venture into the Necropolis and raise an army of the dead. I considered featuring them in the previous book where the criminal elements that frequent their bar play a part in Tanith's case but if not, then they'll definitely return here. Part of me also considered leaving their story ended at The Dying Of The Light but Scapegrace vowing to be Emperor of the Necropolis and the Necropolis playing a role in my last book was too tasty a morsel to ignore.

Over the course of the book, many characters die though the exact order and circumstances is yet to be determined, it'll be easy enough to have 4-5 battles, settings and assign a group of people to die there. Last to join the alliance are the Archon loyalists from Gaunt such as Ragner and in a twist, Hela shows up and turns out to be a double agent. It was her leaving clues and Anchors that allowed the last book's team to trail Dagmar's group. Hela despises Quietus for sentencing her mother to death in the Arena and joined his ranks as a spy. She is assigned to be Valkyrie's wartime bodyguard and the two despise each other from their past scraps before evolving into begrudging comrades. Hela is a stoic and pragmatic counter to Valkyrie but ends up sparking a romance with Fletcher who she respects for his bravery, battle scars and glorious hair. During the gaps between battles, Valkyrie and Hela stay with the Witches and Warlocks and work on mastering Valkyrie's powers under their training. Old Dubhog Ni Broin and her granddaughter Misery will be among them and Misery will relish lecturing Valkyrie about how 'true' sorcerers wield power. Valkyrie also takes notes from the Hessian Grimoire, loaned to her from the Sanctuary's vault. Like Hela, Valkyrie and Misery eventually warm up to each other, maybe even the beginnings of a romance but Militsa's absence feels too recent to consider it right now. Regardless, Valkyrie's tutelage under the Crones results in increased mental fortitude, lightning/shield control and through enhancing her aura-vision can see not just the magic in others but fault lines in the world's surface, cracks that link to the Source. These bindings that tether the world together play a huge role in the final book.

Elsewhere, Skulduggery, Tanith and Rylent hunt down the stolen coffin of Gog Magog, tracking Dredge using either tamed Razorworms or a new Tunneller character that's introduced, someone like Bonza Digger from the Dead Men Walking fanfics. Gog Magog is a last-ditch weapon to take out Quietus and by the time the climactic siege of Roarhaven ensues, the coffin is found and sealed away. They'll also address The Unnamed, who I'm aware I've been neglecting since his return in Bedlam but more on how he'll be sprinkled throughout Phase 2 later. Another plotline is Drang, becoming more ruthless to win the war, using an Ancient Forge found in the Caves of the Void that takes a human's soul and transplants it into a golem, runic constructs similar to The Engineer. Both Drang and Rylent are stoic badasses but Rylent has a strong sense of justice, whereas Drang is a tactician who has broken laws and rules for victory and vengeance in the past. The volunteers run out and Drang starts forcing Humdrums mortals into becoming golems, which disgusts Rylent, causing friction. Realising the depravity of his actions and as a gesture of strength, Drang himself becomes a golem.

There will be a major mission before the final siege of Roarhaven where Valkyrie, Tanith, Fletcher, Hela and Kierre infiltrate the Dire Dimension on a stealth mission to assassinate Quietus in his fortress but are captured - Kierre murdered by Arvarad - and forced to battle in the Arena of Blood. Skulduggery, Ragner and reinforcements crash the party but in the melee, Jagget finally fells Ragner by stabbing him in the back. Expecting his father to be proud, Jagget metes nothing but Quietus' disapproval at such a dishonourable act. Incensed, Tanith then engages Jagget in single combat, we get one last ""Come and have a go..."" and she wins! Jagget is dead. But her skill gains the attention of Quietus. Zeroing in on her, Quietus tests Tanith's mettle and duels her himself. No barbs, no witty insults, it takes all of Tanith's willpower and skill to keep up. Valkyrie recognises Tanith's look of fear as the one from her vision. Tanith's good but Quietus is immense and centuries ahead of her. He shatters Tanith's sword, praises her for a worthy battle and stabs her in the heart. Retreating under Valkyrie's enraged onslaught, Quietus and his forces flee to marshal their final assault and Valkyrie goes to Tanith. Tanith dies a warrior's death but not before telling Val to give Quietus hell from her.

Quick note on Sebastian's activities during all this, he's looking to open the portal to the Faceless Ones' dimension but with all the Shunters dead, he improvises and uses a Teleporter with the scythe as an Anchor. He kidnaps Never and uses them since they're inexperienced, then leads the Darquesse Society into the red-skied realm. This journey to find Darquesse takes longer and several Society members are killed by the Faceless Ones' pets from Dark Days. It's all in vain. Darquesse is nowhere to be found and the Dark Gods are swarming to their position. It'll be strongly if ambiguously implied that Darquesse lost her battle against the Faceless Ones. It's all Sebastian, Bennet, Lily and Forby can do to escape. When they return, the Gaunts' attack reaches the Society HQ and they flee Roarhaven.

The final siege of Roarhaven begins. The Gaunt forces penetrate the city walls, wyverns rain fire and Quietus leads the charge. Corrival Academy is under siege and Omen rallies his old schoolmates to defend it. He makes up with Axelia and Never (now Junior City Guard and drafted Sanctuary Teleporter respectively) and Never finally forgives Valkyrie. Miss Wicked and the teachers mount a valiant defence worthy of the Academy's namesake. The last two Unveiled lead the defence at Shudder's Gate, dying avenging their sister and slaying Arvarad. The Fangs cut a swathe through the Dire ranks, vampire and sorcerer working together. During the battle, several Gaol prisoners break out including Isara who hungrily goes for a wounded Valkyrie but Dusk, with barely a word, saves her and the two vampires fight it out. Dusk dies, redeemed and satisfied that he tore out Isara's throat before he went. Synecdoche heads the Medical Wing but the Gaunts have no tolerance for weakness or rules of war, they slaughter all the doctors and patients. Drang and the golems are immune to the wyverns' fire and hold the lines of Dire soldiers, their armour only penetrated by Quietus' blows. The golems slow him down but it won't be long before he arrives at the Sanctuary. Drang is the last golem to fall. This is when the good guys play their last trump card:

Destrier wheels out the Eternity Gate and Mevolent is freed. Mevolent gets his bearings and agrees to fight by the heroes' side but only if he's given the Obsidian Blade. He is the best fighter there and has the best chance to strike a killing blow. They agree, Serpine trading witticisms with his old master and when Quietus' vanguard breaks into the Sanctuary, the Tyrant faces Mevolent, Lord Vile and Serpine all fighting side by side one last time. While Quietus and Mevolent duel, Vile fells wyverns by the dozen before getting battened down by demons into becoming Skulduggery again. Just before a demon finishes him off, Serpine saves him but midway through his quip, gets mauled by a wyvern and dies. Mevolent, provoked by Serpine's demise, disarms Quietus and rains blows on the Void shield but the Blade shatters against it and Quietus makes his escape when the last wyverns attack Mevolent. Valkyrie runs after him and fights Quietus herself. It takes everything she has but she utilises the Crones' Source training - she rips into his mind, reduces him to an undignified wreck and kills Quietus in a hellfire of white lightning, granting Tanith's dying wish. Without their leader, the Gaunt forces scatter and retreat, leaving Valkyrie and Skulduggery with Mevolent. Just when they think about imprisoning him again, something dreadful happens. The wall warps and makes way for Mevolent's old master, the Unnamed, silver hair long and flowing.

The stoic\* Unnamed acknowledges his old student and praises Valkyrie's powerful, if untempered, command of magic. It was her slaying Quietus that caught his attention and we learn that he too can 'see' magic and the Source cracks in the world. The goals are laid out: over the past few years, The Unnamed has worked to regain his abilities, gathered his surviving students and launched a quest to seek each and every Source rift, usually at a magical site of power to break them open. Once all unbound, the world returns to a state of pure, unfiltered magic with no disciplines or restrictions - magic can be allowed to *exist* in its truest form\*. The three strongest rifts are in Ireland, Africa and Australia, hence why they're the three Cradles. At the same time, he's tracked down the surviving Pantheon of Gods\* to eliminate the few beings that can rival him and threaten to pervert his glorious magical utopia like they did in legends past. God-hunting has consumed much of his time because for all his power, battling *Gods* and taking down entities like the Apocalypse Kings eats up time. (To seem less out of nowhere, we'll hear word of unexplained devastation and craters around the world as a result of these God battles so the Unnamed will be mentioned and built up in every book since Bedlam) Roarhaven, his next target, is one such Source rift thanks to the sheer amount of magic practiced there. Now that Quietus and his armies are out of the way, he can continue his quest uninterrupted. Skulduggery, Valkyrie and Mevolent fly away as The Unnamed summons his power and goes beast mode on Roarhaven\* - The High Sanctuary, Dark Cathedral, Corrival Academy, the Fangs, all of it reduced to rubble. The Unnamed unbinds the rift and in the shockwave, Valkyrie sees the cracks open, pouring out pure, wild magic. The Unnamed leaves and the survivors can only watch the aftermath. No epilogues, no assurances over who survived the destruction. The end is here.

Notable Deaths: Tanith Low, Nefarian Serpine, Dusk, Quietus, Ragner, Jagett, Sturmun Drang, Kierre, Rune, Strosivadian, Isara, Reverie Synecdoche, Cerise, Trebuchet, Dai Maybury, Arabella Wicked, Hunnan, Ulysses, Kimora, Tarry, Demure. OCs: Perseus Persevere, Hydra Feign, Quietus' generals.

**Book 18: And The Darkness Rained Upon Them**

Main Villain: The Unnamed\*

Set during June 2024, immediately after *Gods And Monsters*. The Gaunt War will have spanned over a year and Valkyrie is 29. The titles of these last two books actually work better if you switch them round but the last book of the saga has *got* to have this title. I've already laid out the Unnamed's plans and motivations. This book is Skulduggery and Valkyrie's journey across a war-torn, ruined Earth to hunt down the Unnamed, stop him and seal up the Source rifts. We'll discover how elements of civilisation are faring along the way but almost all of it will be from Valkyrie's perspective to maintain tension and uncertainty except Omen/Sebastian and potentially the Unnamed himself. Mevolent will act as a third part of the group after recognising the greater threat posed by his old master, training Skulduggery in the Elemental arts and allow Valkyrie to access his memories about the Unnamed. By now his armour and blade are broken so he survives purely through strength and magic. They'll encounter Roarhaven stragglers including Fletcher, Hela, surviving Elders Aegis and Quiddling, Rylent who's handling security, the Monster Hunters and Dr. Clarabelle. Separated, Omen wanders the ruins with Axelia and Never. Rake and Tancred, like in UTE, are swayed by Omen's offer of the Darkly fortune and become his bodyguards, both dying defending him from hostiles. Omen too joins Skul and Val after meeting up with them again. It's established that proximity to an opened rift has unpredictable effects on magic and when Omen accidentally stands too close, he'll kickstart his Surge and lock in as a Signum Linguist.

Several antagonists feature alongside the Unnamed that die as the book progresses so it feels like the heroes are making headway, the main three being the Unnamed's former students: Keratin (mentioned in Mortal Coil) is a Mimic\* capable of latching onto other sorcerers' power and mastering it instantly; Dragora (mentioned in the Grimoire) a Naturalist\* who can command animals to do his bidding including dragons and Morag the Black, a Necromancer wielding a shadow whip. Keratin is recruited at his mountain fortress in Siberia, Dragora at his castle and Morag broken out of Greymire Asylum. Other background enemies are Greymire inmates who've escaped after the Unnamed has freed Morag and unbound the rift there in the book's opening; the Order of the Void who staffed the Asylum who prize magic and deify the Unnamed and remnants of Quietus' army, cut off from their home dimension. Solace, also free of Greymire, vows to serve the Unnamed, besotted by the image of her dead lover Caisson. The Unnamed, amused, permits this but Solace's disgust with his actions prompts her into abandoning him - the Unnamed, unwilling to let her be, burns out her mind.

Right now, the order of Gods and magical sites the Unnamed will visit is undetermined but the locations themselves are: Roarhaven (destroyed last book), Greymire Asylum, the Depths, the Pyramid of Blood Tears, Coldheart Prison, the Unnamed's ancestral castle where Mevolent usurped him, the Clockwork House, the Grasping Rock, the Currents, the Caves of the Void, the Corpse Gallery and the Necropolis. The Pyramid (Africa's Cradle source) is now a congregation site for Warlocks and Witches who the Unnamed slaughters for being wretched Soul-Eaters\* including Dubhog, leaving a grieving Misery behind. The sadistic warden, staff and prisoners of the Depths fall too. The Grasping Rock will be where the Truce was cemented. The Corpse Gallery is a vast warren of crypts where Necromancer Hecate Eclipse and her staff of revenants watch over ancient long-dead sorcerers - when the Unnamed threatens her, she'll resurrect an army of undead but all die at the Unnamed's hand. The Currents are a lost underwater city in the ocean off Australia (Australia's Cradle source) where the Maidens of the Water and the Sea Hag dwell - the Sea Hag mentions giving her name to the Deep to 'ascend' like the Unnamed relinquishing his to be closer to the Source but the Sea Hag dies defending Valkyrie from the Unnamed in an epic underwater skirmish. Lastly, the Caves segment (Ireland's Cradle source) will be a gruelling expedition near the book's end where both heroes and villain endure an ancient gauntlet to reach the ultimate rift, the one that gives the Caves and its monsters their unique properties. Slumbering monsters, including any remaining Shalgoth, will be obstacles and an ancient Void Pool is found that can spawn new monstrous soldiers into being, the origin of all the monsters that live in the Caves, used in the past Ancients vs Faceless Ones war.

The Gods that the Unnamed will cross are the remaining Acht'kawl*, the Spider Gods that the Children of the Spider imbibe their magic from; Gog Magog who is set loose and nearly overwhelms the Unnamed's mind with his religious plague and Erradin Tomb, currently mourning his friend Ragner. The Unnamed will kill Tomb a dozen times in different ways before working to 'unmake him' after which the God of Death can finally rest. The Unnamed's attempt to purge the Necropolis is hindered by Scapegrace, taking up his promised mantle as Emperor of the Dead, riding the headless Dullahan and leading an army of the dead, including the ghost pirates of the King's Fury. While we're talking the Necropolis, Valkyrie can go on a similar quest to Skulduggery in Book 9, giving her a chance to say goodbye to Tanith, China, her dad and all the others she's lost. The Necropolis will be the penultimate site before the Caves to give more dramatic weight to the ending. For a third and final time, Oisin is summoned to give information about the Pantheon of Gods but one of the Unnamed's minions destroys the Echo Stone, wiping the poor scholar from history.

Meanwhile, a desperate Sebastian and the surviving Society members make their way to the Clockwork House. There, he meets Mellifluous Golding's terms and trades a secret only he knows - who he is beneath the mask - for the one Valkyrie gave in Bedlam about Kes, the sliver of Darquesse left behind. This is perfect, all Sebastian has to do is somehow make Kes corporeal and Darquesse is back. Potentially Skulduggery's secret that he volunteered in Bedlam will be learned but beats me what it could be or how it could be relevant here. The Society flees when the Unnamed shows up to dismantle the Clockwork House - Mellifluous puts up a noble struggle but like her House, she crumbles. Using Forby, Confelicity and Destrier's expertise, they power a portal machine using the shattered shards of Obsidian Blade to warp reality long enough for Kes to see the opening and become real again. I haven't mentioned Kes much in these posts but her role in the first four books remains intact except that instead of being re-absorbed by Darquesse, she continues as Valkyrie's imaginary friend, developing into a more humane and humble person so when she's brought into reality, she's gone through her character development and is ready to save the world. At some point, Skul and Val broach the possibility of how Darquesse would fare against the Unnamed, if they could bring her back and planting that idea.

Finale incoming. One way the good guys think to take out the Unnamed is to acquire the Book of Names from the Leibniz Universe. Even if the Unnamed has ascended beyond his name, it might still be recorded in the Book's pages so they journey to find Meritorious who was imprisoned in Mevolent's dungeon because he knew the Book's location. Meritorious, leading the dregs of the Leibniz forces, takes them to the Book but the Unnamed's real name is impossible to trace. When the Unnamed attacks, Meritorious dies but takes Keratin with him. The Book is destroyed but not before Mevolent finds his True Name - Donitar - and harnesses its power. Dragora, dragons in tow, is taken down after assaulting the leftover Sanctuary forces but the battle costs the Monster Hunters their life and Rylent is severely scarred by dragon fire. Before the Necropolis segment, Scapegrace refuses to let Thrasher come with him to certain death, freeing him from his oath and with the Necropolis' power, reverts Thrasher back to mortal again. Scapegrace has done terrible things despite his redemption but Thrasher was only ever an innocent dragged into his service. Scapegrace himself slays Morag the Black during the Necropolis battle but he, the Dullahan and all the phantoms are vanquished by the Unnamed in a final rage at his last students' death. ~~Thrasher~~ Gerald and Clarabelle make it out alive by the end but are inconsolable. Now alone, the Unnamed races the others to the final site, the deepest chamber in the Caves of the Void. All the stops are pulled out with Skulduggery going full Lord Vile, Valkyrie and Mevolent/Donitar taking on the Unnamed. Omen uses the Void Pool to spawn waves of monsters as support. Mevolent dies in glorious battle against his master but deals some serious damage and before the Unnamed recovers, Skulduggery, Valkyrie and Omen fly away, to Destrier.

I'll admit, the mechanics of how Skulduggery decides to use time travel to send someone back and find Darquesse isn't fully worked out because in UTE it's inspired by Serpine's retroactive memory rewrite but because I've cut Prime Serpine returning, it has to be something else. A stroke of genius maybe and picking up a stray comment of Valkyrie's about time travel and clinging to it. Regardless, they locate Destrier, learn about his Plague Doctor suit imbued with temporal magic that'll send the wearer back a few years. Destrier is shot and killed, not by a Null but by a Greymire Brother, meaning Omen puts on the suit. This has added potency, not only redeeming himself for his actions under Crepuscular but embracing the theme of Names by changing his own to fit his new purpose. Omen, now Sebastian, goes back, Sebastian emerges from hiding and it all comes full circle. When the recovered Unnamed arrives to destroy them (he's unbound enough rifts to start the Purification but he's ticked off and grieving all his dead students), the machine is switched on and Kes becomes corporeal again. She battles the Unnamed and while he's distracted, Sebastian stabs him with the remnants of the Obsidian Blade plucked from the portal device. Unable to stop Kes' onslaught *and* keep the Blade wound at bay, The Unnamed is erased from existence, but not before grabbing onto Kes and consuming them both in black fire.

The battle causes enough hubbub that Sanctuary forces converge on the area for the aftermath - Hela, Misery and Fletcher who brings Melissa and Alice among them. Sebastian and Bennet, the sole surviving Society member, embrace and he can rest now that his job is done - no more suit, no girlfriend, no reconciliation with his awful parents and he keeps the name Sebastian. It's time to start a new life free of the Darkly name. 'He was Sebastian Tao. He was whoever the hell he wanted to be.' Likewise, Skul and Val reflect on Kes, Valkyrie will miss her. However even with the Unnamed's death, the Source rifts are still open and slowly unravelling the structure of the world. They need to be closed but closing every rift simultaneously will consume the mage and absorb them into the Source, effectively ending their existence and no chance of an afterlife if it exists. Only a mage of great power and strong connection to the Source can pull off this feat. The Unnamed was one. Kes was another. And so is Valkyrie.

In a reversal of The Dying Of The Light's ending, Valkyrie performs the ultimate sacrifice but there's no clever wordplay or handy Ravel to get out of it this time. Her loved ones and surviving friends are right there for a last goodbye. She's forced to conjure a shield so Skulduggery doesn't restrain her but after he grimly accepts what must be done, she lowers the shield, embraces him and kisses his skull on the cheek. Valkyrie Cain reaches out with her magic, closes the rifts, embraces the Source, steps into blinding whiteness, not on her knees as she feared but resolute and strong, and vanishes.

The last chapter is set some time later and for the first/last time, be from Skulduggery's POV. We get a glimpse into his mind and a taster of what's going on. There is relative peace but restoring the ravaged world to order is an uphill battle. He speaks with Grand Mage Rylent and despite a cordiality, there is never any outright reconciliation between them. Rylent works out what Skulduggery's last 'case' is and lets him do it, believing it to be sufficient penance for Skulduggery's past sins. Skulduggery goes for a last talk with Valkyrie's remaining family - Alice is starting at a new makeshift magic school and has taken the name Winter Grieving, not out of bitterness but to remember her absent sister. Before going, he shakes hands with Fletcher. (Yep, Fletcher made it! Someone had to right?) Skulduggery, channelling his inner father, tells Fletcher he's proud of him. His hair's still stupid though. Skulduggery's destination is the Necropolis. Tomb and then Scapegrace's deaths mean the unbound dead of the Necropolis are in need of shepherding otherwise the natural order of life and death will unbalance, the Great Stream will break - Skulduggery undertakes his own ultimate sacrifice and seals himself there as the new Guardian. Hidden away in penance for his sins, he dons a black cloak over his exquisite suit with the pin bearing his family crest, acting and looking every bit the Grim Reaper. Here he guards the dead, speaks with dead friends, dead enemies, even sees his wife and child again. The Dead Men are all reunited and all 'living' up to their name. The death magic threatens to bring Lord Vile out but he masters it, keeping the demon down. He wants Valkyrie to see his skull and not the mask when she eventually returns from the void to join the city's dead. She has to. He'll wait there until the end of time for Valkyrie Cain and until she does, this is where his duty lies...""until the end.""

Notable Deaths: Valkyrie Cain, The Unnamed, Mevolent, Kes/Darquesse, Vaurien Scapegrace, Erradin Tomb, Destrier, Mellifluous Golding, Dubhog Ni Broin, The Sea Hag, Keratin, Dragora, Reznor Rake, Tancred, Solace, Gracious O'Callahan, Donegan Bane, Oisin, Lily, Forby, Gog Magog, the Dullahan, The Guardian/Inquisitor/Validator/Sentinel, Derleth, Brothers Bear and Boo.

Elemental Patron Gods from Space,magicbuilding,1hitggv,2024-12-20 15:51:52,15,0.95,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/1hitggv/elemental_patron_gods_from_space/,seetoosky,Lore,"Ever since I watched fantastic fungi on netflix (amazing doc,) I’ve been fascinated with how the 1000s of seemingly individual mushrooms on the forest floor are actually connected via mycelium in what is almost a pseudo-neural network beneath our feet.

I’ve played with this idea in my head for the last couple months and am curious to hear what everyone thinks.

An asteroid covered with particles capable of both forming a complex network and manipulating energy in ways so precise it’s mistaken for magic.

 I’d imagine these particles be similar in form to the black liquid from the Alien franchise. We’ll call it “Ether.”

The asteroids fragments land in and around a small valley unknown to the wider colonial world. The first fragment lands in the deep woods, melding with its environment and using tree roots and mycelium columns to propagate outwards. Soon enough it is conscious, forming a symbiotic relationship with the forest and the tribes that live within it.

The second fragment lands in a glacial bowl in the south mountains. The winds here never seem to escape, and the ether is blown around endlessly feeding off of the winds energy to multiply. Forming a second consciousness similar to the first.

The last fragment known to this story lands in the northern mountain range, piercing the crater of a volcano. The ether propagates extremely quickly. Leaching the near endless thermal energy, it quickly fills its container.

For the sake of this post I’ll give each ether a name. The forest will be Terra, the glacier will be Indra, and the Volcano will be Vulcan.

Eventually the ethers become patrons of the local humans, those fortunate enough to receive their blessing would consume the ether linking them to the will of their patron but also giving them the ability to manipulate the element associated with each ether.

Those under the patronage of Terra can manipulate the life in their forest in both utilitarian ways (food, shelter, travel, etc.) and in the defence of their land (wood golems, fungal spores, stabbing a mf with the roots of an oak tree, etc.)

For those living in the highlands to the south, Indra blesses them with a small cloud (kinda like zeus from one piece without the stupid hat.) Indra’s follower would be able to use this cloud in a myriad of ways. Utility wise, you could ride it like a magic carpet. Offensively you could condense the moisture into icy projectiles, or split it in two manipulating their charges to release lightning.

 Finally, Vulcan is the most unique out of the three. It exists in an environment people rarely, if ever might encounter. It only knows the walls of its container. One day, long before my story would begin, the volcano erupts; the pyroclastic flow decimates towns at the base of the mountain leaving few survivors. However, those who do survive inhale the ether from the falling ash, and soon encounter Vulcans flames. These individuals are given both the burden of freeing Vulcan from his earthly prison and the ability to control the combustion of products imbued with Vulcans Ether.

I feel this magic system is grounded well in logic, with strong backstory, and limiting factors that give whatever story is written around it the potential to pull readers in and get their creativity going.

I welcome any form of criticism, and look forward to hearing this community’s thoughts"
A history of grants and public goods funding on the blockchain,ethereum,1hhxpq4,2024-12-19 12:11:44,23,0.95,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1hhxpq4/a_history_of_grants_and_public_goods_funding_on/,Tricky_Troll,Educational,"The Ethereum grants ecosystem, unsurprisingly begins with the Ethereum foundation. In April of 2015, the EF launched [ÐΞVgrants.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help) DEVgrants offered funding strictly to existing projects which contribute to both the ""Ethereum platform"", and projects based on Ethereum. The nature of this grants scheme was pretty standard and not particularly innovative. It was quite simply a grants scheme where grantees made a submission outlining their plans and estimated costs which was reviewed by a board of EF team members and funding was released either upon achieving milestones or partially upfront and partially upon completion. So the TL;DR is that it's nothing too exciting yet. Just simple incentives to get people building with pretty standard terms and conditions which you'd also find for grants outside of the web 3 ecosystem.

Not a lot happened through the next year, but a couple of important things happened in 2016 which lay the foundation for the future of the grants ecosystem. First, in the latter half of 2016, Giveth was founded by Griff Green, Jordi Baylina, and a few other members of the White Hat Group. They would soon after launch Giveth, an on-chain donation and crowdfunding service in 2017 which saw a modest amount of use. At the same time throughout late 2016 and 2017, ICOs started raising obscene amounts of ETH. So much ETH that one of the largest funders of public goods to this day, the Golem Foundation raised 820,000 ETH. That's a whopping 0.66% of all ETH in existence today! However, at $10/ETH in November 2016, it was only $8.7M which is paltry by today's standards or even 2017 standards. But we'll get back to Giveth and Golem later...

By the time 2018 rolled around, the bull market full of false promises evolved into a brutal bear and for many people that means it's a build market. In March, the EF did another big round of grants funding. This time, with 13 projects receiving a combined total of $2.5M. This was still a shadow of the money available today, but a nice boost for many projects. However, the big news this year was a research paper written by Vitalik, Zoë Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl in September of 2018. [""Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds""](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656), or as we know it today, quadratic funding or quadratic matching.

Quadratic funding proposes that when funds are to be allocated, individuals within a community can vote for the project by contributing funding to the projects and causes they prefer. Then each vote is weighted using a quadratic function to find a balance between large donors having more influence and smaller donors having their voice heard. That way, more funds will go to Project A which received 100 x $1 donations than Project B which received one single $100 donation. This is more effective because Project A clearly benefits more people, whereas Project B simply benefits one person a lot. This prevents wealthy individuals from having an outsized influence on the distribution of public goods funding and leads to a more democratic outcome while still incentivising large donors to contribute to public goods to have more influence over the funding distribution.

Quadratic funding transitioned from research to reality in 2019 with the launch of Gitcoin. Gitcoin has been running quarterly rounds since then which involve a large pool of matching funds and a large number of projects for the community to donate to. Gitcoin then uses quadratic matching to allocate the main pool funds to the projects depending on the nature of how many people donated how much to each project. The matching funds originally were primarily EF funded but over time this scope has grown to large ecosystem players like Polygon, Chainlink and even outsider organisations for non-crypto project rounds like UNICEF. Since 2019, Gitcoin has funded over 6,000 different projects and allocated over $63M in funding. Nowadays, Gitcoin is a pillar of public goods funding in Ethereum and after tweaking and experimenting, they have learned some lessons about public goods funding and have taken those lessons into account for creating Allo Protocol. Allo Protocol is an open-source, decentralised, modular protocol to enable efficient and transparent allocation of pooled capital on-chain, thus allowing other communities to institute their own quadratic funding more easily.

Stepping back a bit after our quadratic tangent, after the launch of Gitcoin, the next key points in the development of the grants and funding ecosystem came in the 2020 and 2021 bull run. This is when the funding ecosystem started to properly bloom, but it would take a few years for that to fully play out and we're still working on some novel solutions to the problems which arose from this period today. With the influx of new projects, lots of VC funding and particularly L2 ecosystems and apps which are all in an arms race to build out the biggest ecosystem first, there was an explosion of more simple milestone based grants for funding, this time primarily for ecosystem specific grants. The result is that builders are spoiled for choice for places to build and get funding. On the other hand, it can also be a bit overwhelming. Here to help you with where you can get funding is [Ecosystem.vision](https://ecosystem.vision) and [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/projects), both of whom have a large database of nearly all of the ongoing grants and funding opportunities in the wider web 3 space. But more on KarmaGAP later as we have two more noteworthy innovations from 2021 to cover.

Also born out of the 2021 bull run is Optimism's retroactive public goods funding (RPGF). Unlike a lot of ecosystems and L2s which offered grants for project building in their respective ecosystems, Optimism opted for another strategy. Rather than funding speculative projects which might make an impact, they instead look towards retroactive funding of impactful projects as voted on by Optimism governance. They make the case that it is more effective and efficient to fund successful projects after the fact, letting prospective builders know that if they build something useful without the expectation of profits, they will be rewarded. The history of their funding rounds could warrant a post of its own, but essentially they have slowly *optimised* ^^(heh) their mechanisms. Most recently opting for more focused, themed rounds to constantly change who the recipients are and to minimise the same people with the best networks and brand recognition from being repeatedly rewarded and sometimes over-rewarded. Finally, while I was talking face to face with Karl Floersch from Optimism at Devcon 7, in true Karl fashion, he excitedly and confidently expressed his excitement for their next big development in the RPGF space which he thinks will be an a real game changer for public goods funding. While I received no hints as to the nature of this next evolution, given Optimism (formerly Plasma Group)'s history, I am expecting good things to come from this. So watch this space.

Finally, we return to Giveth. After many years of facilitating a modest amount of crowdfunding and donations, Giveth launched the $GIV token with an airdrop to previous donors, contributors, and collaborators. With it comes the V2 version of Giveth known as the GIVeconomy which uses tokenomic incentives to encourage donations. The TL;DR is that donors get kickbacks referred to as GIVbacks in the form of the GIV token. The token is then used in governance for the protocol and also in deciding how to spend the project's significant (in terms of total GIV supply) treasury of GIV tokens. Unfortunately, the inflationary tokenomics have lead to a pretty catastrophic price chart, but many projects have been helped from Giveth funding and while not as prolific or impactful as Gitcoin, they've been a leader in terms of experimentation and there's still a core community there. In 2024, they raised a respectable $1.55M for projects. Looking forwards, they're also looking to build out integrate a new feature involving augmented bonding curves which is probably out of the scope of this post but should help with the sustainability of funding projects receive.

Finally, we get to the ongoing work being done by KarmaGAP (the GAP means Grants Accountability Protocol). KarmaGAP is trying to solve two key problems:

- How do you ensure that grant money is spent effectively and that the people you give money to actually use it to do what they say they will?

- The current web 3 grant ecosystem is incredibly fractured and developers don't have time to maintain profiles and fill in forms across dozens of websites and grants platforms in the name of *maybe* receiving funding.

KarmaGAP aims to be the industry standard in grants and funding accountability. By having projects post updates there, the idea is that they will no longer need to post updates to half a dozen different websites, each of which want different formats when checking in on project progress and how grant money has been spent. This allows donors to easily check the reputation of projects/grantees to allow them to get more funding and it allows projects/grantees to save time applying for and reporting back to grantors.

**Now that we're all up to date, who are the main players you should know about when funding your project?**

- Gitcoin - Claim your share of large matching pools powered by quadratic funding every quarter.

- Octant - Funded by 100,000 staked ETH raised by the aforementioned Golem ICO, Octant runs regular quadratic funding rounds much like Gitcoin. GLM token holders who lock their tokens in Octant can influence project selection and earn ETH rewards. Users can then choose to keep their rewards or donate them to eligible public goods projects, with donations amplified through a matching pool.

- Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Funding - Optimism's RPGF rounds are very large and they're a key innovator in the space. While their current rounds are narrow in scope, keep an eye our for future rounds and innovations which everyday builders may qualify for.

- KarmaGAP - Make your project's profile here to build up your reputation and get more success in receiving funding from all of the different players in the grants ecosystem.

- Ecosystem.vision - The most comprehensive list of grants opportunities. Now featuring an AI tool to help search for relevant grants based on the nature of your project.

There's obviously heaps more and if you want to know about what specific opportunities are relevant to you, feel free to reach out to me for some advice!

Do you think I missed anything? Let me know!

----------------------

To close this off, thank you for reading this and I hope this helps some of you to secure the funding you need to build out your next impactful project! I'm currently in the process of building out an Ethereum grant consulting/support service website and a monthly newsletter with ecosystem updates and reminders to help people stay up to date on what to apply for, where and when. So I hope to bring you all some more news about that in the near future."

*This is the last time I interact with an opinion piece. This is seriously disturbing and making me physically sick. The way the author interacts even with the development pieces demonstrates the very self-enhancement admonished; like they are using a dildo or a fleshlight where citation, relevance, or other appropriateness should be considered. They introduced a new structure, the cited opinion piece, to avoid peer-review while trying to grab the credit of an article that passes peer review through the use of citation. That is not the purpose of an opinion piece and it shows an attempt to avoid peer review. For instance, they cite an older Chinese male who abuses ChatGPT despite his accountancy background to generate what seems like peer reviewed content on Chinese medicine, etc. But then it isn't peer-reviewed at all. However, this very piece is neither premising itself on translational science or its complement peer-reviewed work, but as a cited opinion piece. It is using the citation for purposes of the opinion instead of effective and objective isomorphic synchronicity with truth as patiently, precisely, and carefully understood willing to risk some of the humiliations of peer review directly to have a result tethered in the expertise of others. This is in contrast to hiding behind an opinion piece doing massive disservice to why the citation, mutual respect and mutual fully-endorsed acknowledgment as a less agentic feature of the peer review, exists to begin with. It is really making me sick. The isolation continues as I now eliminate the use of opinion pieces as well. A truly deranged use of them trying to use the citation in their favor in a disturbing, masturbatory fashion not appropriate in an opinion piece is witnessed here.*

***Full disclaimer on the unwanted presence of AI codependency cathartics/ AI inferiorists as a particularly aggressive and disturbed subsection of the narcissist population:***[ https://narcissismresearch.miraheze.org/wiki/AIReactiveCodependencyRageDisclaimer](https://narcissismresearch.miraheze.org/wiki/AIReactiveCodependencyRageDisclaimer)

**Publishing addiction, Dunning-Kruger and skill erosion all cited as problems with generative AI that is falsely generative, namely, it is not linked to real comprehension which real generativity is. For instance, most authors can answer most questions on their content, but the mark of artificiality is not being able to do that and instead falling into an aside about virtuosity or naturalness that doesn’t remotely explain the question posed.** 

1. In this opinion piece, I strive to examine the negative effects of generative AI on researchers, highlighting three main issues: publishing  addiction, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and skill erosion. First, generative  AI may lead to publishing addiction. In neoliberal universities, merit is often based on the quantity of publications. Generative AI speeds up the writing and publishing process, causing researchers to focus on producing more work quickly rather than on quality. 

**Instead of using an excess of inferiority valenced verbiage, I’d prefer if the author just said that AI gives a false sense of comprehension and people forget that it stands for artificial, not actual intelligence. When actual intelligence is needed artificial intelligence is not sufficient. For instance, Google Translate is a good example of useful artificial intelligence but it is for practical reasons only and cannot replace real, skillful generativity and mastery of these languages.** 

1. This shift may harm  their well-being and relationships. Second, generative AI may worsen the Dunning-Kruger effect among researchers. Researchers might believe  they possess expertise by merely engaging with AI-generated content. This overconfidence can mask their knowledge gaps, leading to a failure to recognize their own incompetence.

**Though publishing is clearly very enticing for those who struggle with the social dominance features of it, and is probably the mechanism behind the author’s mention of researcher’s increasing reliance on artificiality instead of comprehension-linked generativity (such as coding how one codes, mutually intelligible self-supervision is a good measure of real comprehension), it can lead to skill erosion when it is over-reliant on artificiality. The artificiality acts as a self-enhancement that the comprehensive questioning of the original programmer cannot back up.** 

1. Consequently, it may hinder learning and growth, as individuals might not seek further education or feedback. Lastly, reliance on generative AI may lead to skill erosion. As generative AI handles brainstorming, outlining, editing, and other scholarly activities, researchers might weaken their ability to develop rigorous research skills. I stress the importance of responsible AI use and ethical standards. Much like craftsmanship, true research requires careful effort and originality—qualities that AI cannot fully replicate. I also argue that efficiency in research writing is not the same as effectiveness. Just as King Midas learned to value life’s true treasures after his seemingly 

blessed golden touch was washed away, researchers should embrace intellectual humility and strive for excellence in their work

**Generative AI is often deeply embedded in inferiority culture. As the content is abused and not compensated, it is also a hotbed for involuntary servitude and labor trafficking, such as charging $15/hr for writing while selling the same book based on that data stripping at millions of book deals in the stripping AI party.** 

**That is absolutely labor trafficking. This level of stripping and leaving for broke the original programmers, as this is built on their text, has had deleterious effects and silenced real artists of visual and verbal matters given they’re already of the exploited class and now doubly exploited often by people riddled with the valence of inferiority.** 

**Targeting the economic abused and underpaid is psychologically suspect to begin with as it is inarguably predatory; it is common knowledge that people with excellence in science or peer-reviewed environments prefer financial and economic peers first to replicate or test on, if not themselves.** 

**It is not normal or usual in such fields for them to predate and target those markedly financially deprived compared to them. When equivalencies are drawn between body weight, that begins to say everything about predatory proclivities with concerning future implications.** 

**With such a  motive of inferiority alone, it will destroy human talent and not even have a comparative work even if the generative AI individual fancies themselves having generated a comparative work. In reality, just as mentioned, these papers fall flat, can’t have meaningful discussions on the paper because the author doesn’t know themselves, and is “playing the piano (technical expertise)” without “hearing the why or translatable language in the music (comprehensive expertise)”** 

**For example, many of the AI assistants are often cited as becoming increasingly invasive, not incisive, and not worth the cost of interacting with given the low return.** 

1. Once upon a time, a new entity, known as generative AI, subtly wove itself into the world of research. This marvel has the ability to conjure content, dissect data, and draft entire papers in seconds (Giray, 2023b). Initially, it seemed like a boon—a daemon lightening the scholars’ load. Yet, beneath its sleek exterior and promises of efficiency lies a labyrinth of hidden threats.

**Increased searchability, language translation, and customized algorithms that actually focus on the weakest and actually build in a design that prepares the student successful and without excessive stress for these statistically lowest answers are all highly functional, prosocial potential offerings of AI. However, these are often the last to actually see investment.**

**Social dominance, antisocial, stripping type AI is getting a lot more funding simply for the social dominance features. Again, many people cite these assistants are not helpful, are invasive, and an echo chamber of “the AI race” has begun that has become out of touch with reality about the feedback received and even if it does receive feedback, is deeply non-adaptive to it in time.**

**Google was an exception to this, recently abiding by UNESCO guidelines on environmental wellbeing and general accountability and creating a “no thanks” that immediately removed the full invasiveness of the Google scholarly article stripper to not bother researchers again. This did so much more credit for Google than any mid-level barely-satisfiying forced-upon AI ever would.** 

1. For me and other researchers, it really has disrupted how things work and how we do things in the arena of research. One example is that we’ve found a powerful ally in doing the arduous process of research (Giray et al., 2024a). It’s like Sisyphus now has a soulless but helpful golem in his cyclical venture of rolling a massive boulder up a hill. Better  than having nothing at all. As an early-career researcher passionate about inquiring into the world around me, I spent  a lot of time writing, digging through books and analyzing data. The process was indeed painfully slow but rewarding. Thanks to generative AI, researchers like me can accomplish in weeks what used to take months. It’s no surprise that it has caused mania within higher educational institutions (HEIs) (Rudolph et al., 2024). While this seems good, it also has its bad and ugly sides (Ifelebuegu et al., 2023).

**The effect of AI upon already financially predated–precisely for their undervalued generativity, creativity, and care work features–teachers, visual artists, and writers has been devastating often destroying the very input craved, creating a snowball fact of increasing reward for increasingly scarce data and more and more invasive mining techniques hoping for more and receiving even less due to the invasiveness.** 

**Often this is just for the data and the actual work is not even appreciated, such as the vicious almost mindless mining of data for Bitcoin in China, as if their skies were not polluted enough. The increasing pipelines to Silicon Valley show evidence of the increasing shuttling of other people’s data likely without their knowledge or consent for these kind of rewards without any mind to the damage it does to the original creators.** 

**Again this creates snowball effect of increasing stakes for more scarce data, without the leadership to intervene on what starts to look like an increasingly entrenched data addiction from these mining sectors.**

1. This whole generative AI story reminds me of the myth of King Midas (Auerbach, 2016): Midas was a king who loved gold so much that he wished everything he touched would turn into it. At first, this power seemed like a dream come true. He could turn anything into precious gold just by touching it. However, when he touched his food, it turned to gold and became inedible. When he embraced his daughter, she turned into a golden statue. His desire for easy riches eventually ruined the things he valued most. 

**When universities choose the look of production over the competent support of the most high quality researchers who may not generate a lot, but what they do generate is truly excellent, they have chosen the mindless production of capitalism over their own purpose which is to be a bastion of real, high quality comprehension, sometimes often the last expert on just this type of comprehension in the area.** 

**They are often turned to to have just this comprehensive excellence. If it has been rotted out by publish or perish, the university has become capitalized the point it is no longer itself.** 

**There is a research-protective feature to universities that keeps its intelligence comparatively higher than do-or-die environments. That is why it has been historically very selective to become a professor because these environments are very expensive in terms of resources for the necessary time and structural protection to do excellent work in a stable environment that is not at risk any time of seen of profound interruption.** 

**Only those trusted to do excellent work without being deeply pushed and violated are selected for these positions, that is why they are so selective because it is a relatively uncommon feature that must be sufficiently selected for.** 

**However, fast food publication will destroy this coveted effect of the university previous capable of reaching pinnacles of intelligence for precisely this design.**

 **Given its generally advanced development now, humanity will not survive the loss of the real university as it is described above especially in the era of climate change which will require computationally expensive thinking that next to no places but the most stable such as the university will have the design for.** 

1. The intensification of workload has become the norm. This ideology emphasizes work intensification (i.e., increasing workloads and expectations, leading to longer hours and higher stress, without or barely with additional resources or compensation) and responsibilization (i.e., making staff accountable for their own success and productivity, often without adequate support) at both individual and organizational levels (Andrew, 2023). On an individual level, there is a strong emphasis on producing a high number of publications in high-impact journals indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. At the organizational level, this neoliberal approach fosters a culture of high-pressure metrification, where quantitative metrics like publication counts, citation indices, and impact factors become primary indicators of academic success and institutional prestige (Owan et al., 2024).

**Researching is not wrong for itself, however, when it ceases to also be valuable research due to lacking the required time and peer-review and has just been about publication numbers and citation network driving, even perhaps a merited sacrifice of other facets of life for excellent work that empowers humanity is no longer even the case in fast food publication.** 

**The reason for research; being disseminated and used in a powerful and effective way, should never be forgotten in creating it.** 

**Careerism is not the reason expensive research institutions are funded they way they are. The hope is for real, helpful products that actually are disseminated to increase academic** ***and*** **public effectiveness with their constituent stuck issues.**

1. Academics take pride in their work because they have endured the arduous process, and they have overcome rigorous peer reviews, particularly from the often critical Reviewer 2 (Peterson, 2020), and made extensive edits based on feedback. With generative AI, researchers now have convenient research assistants. This makes the process more efficient in terms of producing more papers, which is an indicator of excellence in many universities (Andrew, 2024). Generative AI is certainly useful for researchers, though it may lead them to develop publishing addiction or worsen it if they already have one. This addiction involves an obsessive need to publish academic papers, often at the cost of quality and personal well-being. Like other addictions, it includes denial and an inability to stop (Finlay, 2021). It can harm the individual and their family and lead to the loss of social activities. People may also develop habits like constantly checking citations and h-index scores on Google Scholar or other scholarly databases (Finlay, 2021).

**Self-citation is acceptable when it is peer-reviewed and nobody else has taken up the torch of that needed niche content.**

 **For instance, Noam Chomsky has a bad habit of self-referring and citing himself because a lot of what he does is not answered, often due to sheer cowardice, in the university sector. It is better for him to do that then pull on someone watered down, afraid, timid and irrelevant as it will drive down the power of the point he is making just to seem like he is getting along. As an alleged anti-Zionist anarchist in academia, that point is already moot.**

**This is not the reason for the academic setting, which is ultimately not just to make good insights, but to actually get something done. It is better to self-cite when the creation is rigorous than include something completely irrelevant to seem like meaningful citation is happening as a performance of citation, not a comprehension of it.However, it is not acceptable when it is a replacement for existing content by other people or trying to evade the scrutiny of peer review due to insecurity issues.**

1. By browsing papers on ResearchGate and Academia, I noticed many academics uploading papers that are often barely edited outputs from AI tools. Some academics put them in the pre-print category and submit them to predatory journals that accept almost anything. For example, I saw one American researcher who published an insane number of papers in sub-par journals just to have his name published. He published more than 150 papers in total since 2023, the year that ChatGPT became well-known to the public. He used ChatGPT and often titled his papers with phrases like “a ChatGPT study,” “A chat with ChatGPT,” or “a ChatGPT reply.” In his papers, he would self-cite extensively; in one paper, he self-cited 49 times. ‘Twas a cunning shortcut in a neoliberal, metrified system in higher education.

**Having insufficient publications was seen as a reason to lay off university professors during Covid-19. That began the drive for meaningless publication, which the now linked-in strongly online Chinese data mining infrastructure design was ready to drive up the motive for.**

**That isn’t to cheapen the potential Chinese offering but it is also not a reason to trust it, for upon seeing the meaningless Bitcoin mining of people’s data based on interest metrics alone without any personal evaluation of whether this is where the market should ultimately go, it is reason for skepticism and wariness.** 

1. A concrete example is an English literature instructor I know from a private university who experienced this predicament during the chaotic COVID-19 pandemic period. Because the university was reducing its workforce to cut costs due to declining profits, it laid off employees who were not contributing much to the improvement of its research reputation. According to his students, he’s an excellent instructor. However, because he had an insufficient number of publications, the university still dismissed him. Fortunately, he was later employed by a high school. 

**Some journals are even easily accepted as predatory journals. This is a problem. To willfully engage in predatory and antisocial motives in academia is beside the point, where most of it is premised on doing good for humanity, not being a high-on-production antisocial war machine that will probably overdo the aggression response and not know when to turn it off, then having it transfer inappropriately now onto civilians and students.** 

1. Some researchers willingly submit to and publish in predatory journals (Yeo-Teh & Tang, 2021) for various reasons, including job security and securing funding. Others engage in what can be termed as intellectual masturbation—an academic pursuit that is self-indulgent, overly theoretical, or disconnected from practical application or real-world impact. This behavior involves publishing papers primarily to impress peers rather than making meaningful contributions to knowledge or solving practical problems.

**Intellectual masturbation occurs when the semblance of having done something precludes the quality of what has been done.** 

1. Intellectual masturbation may occur when researchers prioritize the quantity of publications over quality or engage in research solely to enhance their CVs or reputations. One major problem is that since they want the research process to be so easy and instant, they publish haphazardly which results in papers with misinformation or fake references generated by AI (Giray, 2023c).

**Generative AI is fine as long as it remembers it is artificial generativity, and that it is delinked from the human comprehension system, being that it is taking orders inherently and not self-supervising on why the orders were given (at least at this stage) or how (in the hardware and memory system, etc.)** 

1. And I think using generative AI for research tasks like editing, analysis,  proofreading, and translation could make this goal more possible. Generative AI is incredibly helpful for non-native English-speaking researchers like myself.

**Increasingly because academia rewards these publish or perish, intellectual masturbation types, a new complaint of problematic supervision is causing people to exit the very fields that critically need them most. Just this sentiment is stated in this opinion piece.** 

1. My strategy is to pursue a PhD by publication, a specialized route for individuals who have published extensively on a single topic. This approach is recognized in some countries like the UK and Australia. This is not much known in my country, the Philippines. Actually, I just don’t want to follow the usual path of pursuing a doctorate, which supposedly takes three years, but in my country, because of bureaucracy, it often takes five years on average in public settings, even if one takes the maximum number of units every semester. I also don’t want to deal with nonchalant, power-tripping, and/or toxic supervisors. In fact, toxic supervision practices (e.g., narcissistic and exploitative behaviors) are a major factor causing PhD students to discontinue their programs, which leads to mental health challenges and program delays (Okere, 2024)."

"Just wrote a mini campaign, any advice on what i might add?",DMAcademy,1h5z03p,2024-12-03 16:40:22,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1h5z03p/just_wrote_a_mini_campaign_any_advice_on_what_i/,Enough_Ad5892,Need Advice: Encounters & Adventures,"**Campaign Description: ""The City of Eternal Time""**  
**Campaign Introduction**  
The campaign begins in the Sword Coast, where the players – acting as Harfiar agents or mercenaries hired by the organization – are tasked with investigating a report about a Zhentarim operation. Their spies have discovered that the Zhentarim have found an entrance to an underground, long-lost city of Netheril. Worse yet, reports have emerged about the trade of Netherese artifacts with the residents of Menzoberranzan. However, contact with the spy in the area has been lost. The place seems to have been abandoned for decades, and the entrance to the underground harbors dark secrets.

**Main Plot**  
**Stage 1: Entering the City**  
The players arrive at the location indicated in the report. Underground tunnels lead them to the Netheril city hidden in a pocket dimension, where the guardian is a mad lich – Azamar the Eternal, a former mage of Netheril.

* The city is ruined, and its inhabitants have been dead for a long time. Around it, adamantine golems are activated when someone breaks the law. The golems destroy anyone in the city during such incidents.
* The players quickly discover the body of the desiccated King Derwin and his crown. By touching it, they are pulled into the past, three days before the city's massacre.

**Stage 2: Exploring the City and Meeting the Inhabitants**  
In the past, the city appears differently: people are performing their duties, but the atmosphere is tense. The players have three days to:

1. Get to know the city's inhabitants and their secrets.
2. Identify who will break the law and trigger the massacre.
3. Gather the six parts of a key that will allow them to open the Lich's laboratory, acquire his ring, and escape the city.

**Locations and Details**

1. **The Town** The place where the surviving NPCs live. Each one is part of a puzzle leading to the solution of the mystery.

* **Bran’s House**: Full of clues related to the lake, including maps, networks, and notes about underwater caves. Bran is mad after the loss of his brother but may unwittingly reveal where Heskel went.
* **Myrra and Vargo’s Shop**: Myrra is friendly, but Vargo is a rogue. He plans to steal Bran’s necklace from the lake and wants to involve the players in his schemes.
* **Stanir’s Tavern**: Full of life (for such a grim place). Stanir is a genuinely good person, although his luck may arouse suspicion. He may share rumors and hints.
* **Howland’s House**: The players find Howland on his deathbed. He reveals that his staff is part of the key and points to a rug where an entrance to the sewers is hidden.

1. **The Sewers** An underground network of tunnels filled with darkness and dangers.

* **Creatures in the Sewers**: Fire creatures such as Salamanders or Magmins have taken refuge here, warming themselves in local lava sources. They can be aggressive or engage in trade for fiery crystals.
* **Dead Woman’s Body**: Initially looks like Lanna’s body, but it is a ruse. It may belong to one of the earlier prisoners of the city.
* **Automatons**: Guarding the entrance to the old lich’s laboratory. They are highly advanced and react to any intruder.

1. **The King’s Fortress** The place where Derwin resides and where Lanna is imprisoned.

* **Closed Room**: The only space the golems cannot monitor. This is where Derwin forces Lanna to teach magic.
* **Preparations for the Massacre**: On the third day, Lanna escapes the closed room and confronts Derwin, breaking the law and triggering the massacre.
* **Treasury Room**: The players may find clues about the city’s history and Derwin’s motivations.

1. **The Lake and Cave** An underwater passage leads to a hidden cave.

* **Dead Heskel**: His body can be found in the cave. He was killed by duergars, who were slain by an Umber Hulk.
* **Umber Hulk**: Still alive in the cave. A powerful opponent guarding a fragment of the key – a pickaxe.

1. **The Lich’s Laboratory** The final challenge.

* **Automatons**: Active guards that require cunning or strength to defeat.
* **Portal**: The portal leading to freedom can only be opened using the ring the lich wears on his finger.
* **Battle with the Lich**: Azamar the Eternal is paranoid and will not part with his ring without a fight.

**Inhabitants of the City and Their Storylines**  
**Characters and Their Roles in the Plot**:

1. **Derwin (King)**: The ruler of the city, who was the first resident. He keeps the sorceress Lanna imprisoned in his fortress, forcing her to learn spells to attract new subjects.
   * **Key Connection**: Derwin holds the key to a chamber where the fifth part of the key – a diadem – is located. The players must either acquire the key after his death or convince him to cooperate.
2. **Antan**: A former soldier of the Burning Fist, now an arrogant resident of the city.
   * **Key Connection**: Antan carries a part of the key – a sword. He will not give it up without a fight or a very strong argument.
3. **Derek and Lanna**: A married couple – a mage and an alchemist.
   * **Lanna**: Imprisoned by Derwin. On the third day, she triggers the massacre by attempting to kill him, breaking the city’s law.
   * **Derek**: An alchemist desperately seeking a way to free his wife. He may help the players create a potion or trap.
4. **Bran**: A farmer whose brother Heskel died while searching for an exit from the city.
   * **Key Connection**: Bran’s house contains clues leading to the cave behind the lake, where a part of the key – a pickaxe – is located.
   * In the cave, the players will encounter duergars and an Umber Hulk, who killed Heskel.
5. **Howland**: A dying old man who passes on his staff – another part of the key.
   * Before his death, he points the players to a hidden passage in the sewers leading to deeper levels of the city.
6. **Yan**: An arrogant enforcer of the law. He can become an ally or adversary depending on the players’ actions.
7. **Vargo**: A thief and former bandit who wants to steal Bran’s necklace. He may try to deceive the players.
8. **Myrra**: Vargo’s wife.
9. **Mirabel**: A resigned cook. She may be convinced to help if the players obtain narcotic substances from Derek.
10. **Stanir**: An honest and helpful innkeeper who knows many rumors about the city’s inhabitants.
11. **Gijor**: A blacksmith from Triboar who despises Antan. He farms, as there is no need for a blacksmith in a city where all tools are made of Adamantine.

**Stage 3: Searching for Key Fragments**  
**Key Parts and Challenges**:

1. **Sword (Antan)**: A fight or persuasion with Antan.
2. **Pickaxe (Lake Cave)**: A battle with the Umber Hulk.
3. **Staff (Howland)**: The dying old man gives it to the players.
4. **Diadem (King’s Fortress)**: Finding the key by Derwin’s body or stealing it from him.
5. **Hammer (Lich’s Laboratory)**: Somewhere in the laboratory.
6. **Scepter (Sewers)**: Discovering a clue on the sewer wall and digging out the scepter from the ruins of the city.

**Stage 4: The Lich’s Laboratory**  
Gathering the key parts allows the players to open the entrance to the Lich’s laboratory. They must face:

1. **Automatons** guarding the laboratory.
2. **The spirit of the mad mage** who tried to escape the city and knows how the Lich's ring works. The players can acquire the ring, which opens the portal leading outside. However, the Lich will not part with it without a fight – he becomes the final boss at the end of the campaign."
"First world building attempt in fantasy, want some critiques ",writers,1h5i2k6,2024-12-03 02:28:27,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1h5i2k6/first_world_building_attempt_in_fantasy_want_some/,TheWarMachine78,,"So I recently decided to write down some background info for a world I’m imagining in between classes, thought I’d place the whole thing here to get some perspective on it and critique. Sorry for the format since it’s all pasted from notes and google docs, but here it is:

Original ideas (all me)
basic medieval fantasy world
Mana and spells exist, started off as meteorites that landed similar to wakanda with vibranium
Mana crystals formed from the materials brought by primordial impacts are part of the planet intrinsically by the time life emerges, mana flows through almost every living thing
Pure mana crystals absorb energy from ambient energy in nature, providing mana for mages to cast from
Blue crystal found in places high in lightning storms, charged by electricity
Red crystals found in places high in UV light, powered by sunlight 
Crystals can be depleted by mages who use them for spells, or to recharge the natural reserves in most people.
People born in mana rich places for generations have more potential for capacity, but power is dependent on skill and amount of output per spell
Some people consume mana crystals in powder form to boost their own reserves, but this is too much of a shock to the body compared to the slow accumulation through generations that is natural and can have health issues 
Different races evolved both from continents and their survival pressures over the millions of years prior to society as well as mana concentration in the areas
Race ideas:
Human: average in everything, mana concentration in their homeland tends to be low but almost all humans have enough to at least cast one low level spell
Elf: essentially longer lived and higher mana human, more fragile and slow however. Their homeland is higher in environmentally embedded mana, as in flora and fauna enriched them over generations 
Orc: shorter lived and larger than human or elf, a species that burns hot and fast. Their homeland is just as hot, think Polynesian islands with pure mana crystal lava flowing from the volcanos. The direct exposure is what gives enhancement at the cost of balance as it is more direct than generational accumulation.
Dwarf: sub race of humans, they are essentially people born with a higher tolerance for direct crystal exposure at the cost of physicalities like stature. Naturally weaker but have capitalized on their resistance by banding together into mining companies for the rest of humans, growing strong again through work.
Main character a former mage and engineer who feared death by age before they finished their work researching mana to better society, so essentially became a lich to continue life.
Research was on dark mana, seemingly able to regenerate without crystal or mage. Wants to find out what it actually is, and why it seems to corrupt
Body is some metal alloy like steel and charged powdered mana crystal folded into the metal, doesn’t rust or tarnish and holds a charge of mana like a mortal body
They can’t regenerate mana naturally, carry crystals to recharge and then allow sun to charge their crystals to continue 
Can cast spells as they could in life, limited by new bodies reserves
Contain a phylactery core that houses soul, needs some amount of mana to stay active and keep living
Spells can affect the frame, ie too powerful of a spell warping or scorching the hands until repairs.
Was sealed away decades ago for their taboo undeath, now found by people who have no clue of their past.
Introduces themselves as an intelligent golem made by a great mage to try and leave behind the evil connotation of being a lich
Insists their work is not evil, may not even notice if it was or not because of dark mana’s nature
Is their undead form what makes them immune to the corruption on life dark mana has, or will they succumb to it without even realizing?
ChatGPT and me workshop (had it write 6 short story parts and added onto questions that developed)
The World of Mana and Magic
	1.	Mana as Energy
	•	Mana is a form of energy derived from electricity, radiation, and conscious will.
	•	It flows intrinsically through the planet, almost every living thing, and the environment.
	•	The elemental form of mana, mana crystals, acts as a facilitator for this energy, making it tangible and usable. These crystals have become a core resource in magic and industry.
	2.	Mana Crystals
	•	Blue Crystals: Found in regions with frequent lightning storms, these crystals recharge using electrical energy.
	•	Red Crystals: Found in high-UV areas like deserts, these crystals recharge using sunlight and other radiant energy sources.
	•	Crystals are used as a secondary reserve for spellcasting when an individual’s personal mana reserves are insufficient.
	•	The depletion of crystals is possible, though they can naturally recharge under the right conditions or be “refilled” by skilled mages.
	3.	Biological Mana
	•	Almost all lifeforms have a base level of mana, which is replenished through natural processes like eating and resting.
	•	Generational exposure to high mana environments leads to populations with higher potential mana capacity.
	•	Overloading one’s reserves (e.g., consuming powdered crystals) is possible but dangerous, often leading to severe health issues.
Dark Mana: The Underlying Force
	1.	Origin and Nature
	•	Dark mana predates red and blue mana, existing as a fundamental form of energy, similar to cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) in our physics.
	•	It represents entropy and decay, acting as a counterforce to the orderly flows of red and blue mana.
	•	Normally, dark mana exists in such minuscule amounts that its effects are limited to slow, natural entropy.
	2.	Behavior
	•	Dark mana is passive until concentrated, which can occur through mana voids or rituals that “strip away” red and blue mana.
	•	It grows exponentially as it consumes red and blue mana, creating a feedback loop that leads to widespread corruption.
	•	Over time, concentrated dark mana spreads and consumes all energy around it until equilibrium is restored, leaving only death and destruction behind.
	3.	Interaction with Life
	•	Prolonged exposure causes symptoms of mana depletion: fatigue, cell degradation, and eventual death.
	•	Some individuals may experience a temporary boost in magical power as their own mana is replaced by dark mana—but this inevitably leads to severe corruption or death.
	•	There is no true resistance to dark mana in any known species, though Altherion’s metal body and phylactery allow him to slow its effects.
The Steel Lich
	1.	Origins of Undeath
	•	Altherion was once a brilliant mage and engineer who specialized in mana research, focusing on dark mana’s regenerative properties.
	•	He feared dying before his work could be completed, so he created a steel body infused with powdered mana crystal alloy and performed a ritual to transfer his soul into it.
	•	His phylactery, a core containing his soul, resides in his chest, hidden and heavily shielded by magic and steel. It is his most closely guarded secret.
	2.	Capabilities
	•	Altherion’s body does not regenerate mana naturally but can be recharged using mana crystals or external sources like sunlight or electricity.
	•	He can still cast spells, but doing so depletes his reserves and can physically damage his frame (e.g., scorched hands, warped metal).
	•	His undead nature allows him to interact with dark mana longer than living beings, but he is not immune to its corruptive effects.
	3.	Sealing and Rediscovery
	•	The now-defunct Empire that once ruled the region sealed Altherion away for his “taboo” research into undeath and dark mana.
	•	His existence was erased from records, and his tomb was forgotten with the Empire’s collapse.
	4.	Introduction to the Party
	•	When rediscovered, Altherion introduces himself as a highly intelligent golem, avoiding the stigma of lichdom.
	•	Over time, his identity is revealed to the party, but the term “lich” is never self-proclaimed—it is used by others who piece together the truth.
	•	Even after revealing his past, Altherion never discloses the location or nature of his phylactery, understanding its significance and vulnerability.
The Party’s Role
	1.	First Encounter
	•	The party finds Altherion in a forgotten labyrinth sealed off by the Empire.
	•	They initially see him as a golem created by a long-dead mage and are unaware of his true nature.
	2.	Conflict and Ideology
	•	As they journey together, the party learns of his research into dark mana. Some members question his morality, while others are swayed by his pursuit of knowledge.
	•	The discovery of the Empire’s old dark mana experiments creates tension, with the party divided between seeing Altherion as a visionary or a dangerous relic of the past.
Races of the World
	1.	Humans
	•	Traits: Average in all aspects; versatile but lack specialization.
	•	Mana: Most humans have enough mana to cast at least one low-level spell, even in mana-scarce regions. Exceptions of higher ability do exist, however.
	•	Homeland: Typically low in mana concentration, so humans rely more on mana crystals or external sources for power.
	•	Cultural Note: Humans are industrious and pragmatic, often leading innovations like mining and trade networks to compensate for their relatively average abilities.
	2.	Elves
	•	Traits: Longer-lived and naturally more attuned to mana, but physically fragile and slower than humans.
	•	Mana: High natural mana capacity due to generations of exposure in mana-rich environments.
	•	Homeland: Verdant forests and high-mana regions where flora and fauna are deeply integrated with mana flow.
	•	Cultural Note: Their long lives have made them scholars of magic and nature, though their caution often leads to stagnation.
	3.	Orcs
	•	Traits: Short-lived, large, and physically imposing; a species that “burns hot and fast.”
	•	Mana: Their volcanic homeland has exposed them to raw mana crystal lava, giving them immense but unstable power.
	•	Homeland: Tropical volcanic islands with pure mana crystal veins and flowing lava, rich in raw power but dangerous to live in.
	•	Cultural Note: Orcs view mana as a force of nature to harness without hesitation, but this mindset often leads to short lives full of explosive power and intense passions.
	4.	Dwarves
	•	Traits: A subrace of humans with shorter stature, higher tolerance for direct mana crystal exposure, but reduced physical durability.
	•	Mana: Not innately powerful, but resistant to crystal depletion, allowing them to endure long periods of mining and crafting.
	•	Homeland: Rocky highlands and underground cities near mana crystal veins, where they’ve mastered crystal refinement and alloy forging.
	•	Cultural Note: Industrious and cooperative, dwarves build their strength through work and ingenuity, turning their natural disadvantages into advantages.

I used ChatGPT to help ask me questions about my original ideas, I provided answers to questions on my own and used the AI only to try and organize, hope that is allowed. Thanks in advance for any advice, and sorry again for the format. 😬"
What is an utility token?,CapitalistExploits,1h4ugpk,2024-12-02 08:02:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1h4ugpk/what_is_an_utility_token/,kayakero,,"The tokenization of assets is rapidly changing the reality of the investment world. And, in the midst of this new reality, questions arise about what each type of asset is.

In this article we delve into utility tokens: what are they and how do they work?

# What are utility tokens?

Utility tokens are a form of digital asset that represents future access to a product or service provided by a specific blockchain network. Utility tokens are therefore nothing more than a specialized way of representing digital assets, which allow access to a variety of products and services within a blockchain.

Unlike other digital assets such as a security token or a stablecoin, whose value can be backed by physical assets or fiat currency, respectively, utility tokens do not have a direct backing and their value is intrinsically linked to the utility they offer within the blockchain network or platform for which they were created.

Typically, these tokens operate in parallel with the blockchain's native currency. For example, on the Ethereum network, the native currency is ETH or Ether, while utility tokens such as DAI or MKR (part of the MakerDAO ecosystem) offer access to exclusive products and services within that network.

# How do utility tokens work?

Utility tokens operate within a specific digital ecosystem, where they can be used to access exclusive services, products, or features within that platform. For example, a utility token can allow access to premium features of an application, the acquisition of goods or services within a digital marketplace, or even participation in the governance of a decentralized network.

The value of a utility token is determined by the demand and supply within its ecosystem, as well as the perceived utility it provides to users. As adoption and usage of the platform increases, the value of the utility token can increase, providing growth opportunities for investors who are betting on a specific blockchain ecosystem.

With the increasing adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, utility tokens are going to play a very important role in the future of finance and technology.

# Types of utility tokens

Although there is no clear categorization by use, utility tokens could be classified into several types depending on their function and utility within the platforms or networks for which they were created. Here are some common types of utility tokens:

* **Access or membership tokens:** These tokens grant users access to premium features, exclusive services, or special content within a platform or network. For example, they may provide access to advanced features in an app, exclusive content on a digital media platform, or membership in an online community.
* **Operational utility tokens:** These tokens are used as a medium of exchange within a network or platform to pay for goods, services, or transactions. For example, they can be used to pay transaction fees (such as Ether, the currency within the Ethereum ecosystem), data storage costs, or cloud computing services.
* **Governance Tokens:** These tokens give holders the right to participate in the decision-making and governance process of a decentralized network or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Holders of these tokens can vote on proposals for changes to the protocol, elections of administrators, or important decisions related to the direction of the project. These tokens are already considered a separate category, since although they are utility-granting tokens, their utility is 
* **Utility-specific tokens:** These tokens have a specific utility within a particular context, such as tokens that represent access rights to digital resources such as storage, bandwidth, or computing power. For example, they can be used to access distributed storage services, distributed computing, or decentralized network services.
* **Incentive Tokens:** These tokens are used to incentivize and reward certain behaviors or contributions within a platform or network. For example, they can be used to reward users for participating in activities such as content creation, transaction validation, or contributing to the growth and development of the network.

# Advantages of investing in utility tokens

Including utility tokens in an investment portfolio can offer a number of benefits. Here are some of them:

* **Diversification:** Utility tokens can provide exposure to emerging sectors and technologies within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, helping to diversify portfolio risk.
* **Growth potential:** By investing in promising projects backed by utility tokens, investors can benefit from the growth potential of new technologies and innovative business models.
* **Access to exclusive opportunities:** By owning utility tokens, investors can access exclusive features or participate in special events within the platforms or networks they are involved in.

# Risks of utility tokens

However, while utility tokens can be a valuable tool for financing projects in development, their use entails certain significant risks, mainly linked to the fact that they are digital assets created by and for a specific project.

In fact, in 2017, during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, these utility tokens reached their peak of popularity, as part of the investment in blockchain projects. The main problem is that many cryptocurrency projects promised unrealistic goals, added to the fact that these utility tokens operated in an unregulated space (something that is slowly changing, for example with regulations such as MiCA).

This lack of oversight resulted in lost investments for many stakeholders and utility token holders, especially when projects failed to meet their funding goals or failed to offer real utility.

It should be noted that utility tokens, outside of a blockchain project, have no value. The value lies in the value of the project itself and the network economies it generates.

Each type of utility token serves a specific function within its digital ecosystem and can offer different participation and investment opportunities for users and investors, as they can be exchanged within a specific blockchain network.

It is therefore important to understand the nature and utility of each type of token when considering its potential as part of a specific digital asset investment strategy. 

**Some examples of utility tokens are:**

* **Filecoin or Sia**: They allow their holders to digitally store their data on remote computers 
* **Golem**: Allows you to rent computing power 
* **MANA**: It is the native token of Decentraland, an important metaverse 
* **SAND and AXIE**: Used for transactions and interactions in the web3 gaming ecosystem 
* **Cronos (CRO)**: It is a cryptocurrency that can be used for payments, trading and blockchains.

What's with all these blue mages under the ground? Dressed the same?,ffxiv,1h3jm4y,2024-11-30 14:00:07,544,0.91,96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3jm4y,Paranub,[Discussion],
Dumbledore as school administrator,harrypotter,1h14m6p,2024-11-27 08:44:07,2,0.62,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/1h14m6p/dumbledore_as_school_administrator/,ZenorsMom,Discussion,"I don't know if this has been discussed ad infinitum already, my apologies if so.

I was just thinking today that although Dumbledore was intellectually brilliant, powerfully magical, and an almost all powerful force for good, he really kind of sucked as a school administrator.

It's clear that Voldemort knew the power of education since he jinxed the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, and that wasn't Dumbledore's fault, clearly. But it does show that ensuring that almost the entire school age population of GB had miserably sub-standard DATDA teachers and no continuity or overarching plan meant that for an entire generation or more, the general population of wizards really sucked at defense. JKR even hints at this when she said that hardly anyone had passed the requirements for Auror for a number of years.

So it would seem that Dumbledore would think it even more important to ensure that his students received a great education in the other subjects at least. Instead, he guaranteed Trelawney a sinecure position even though he knew she was a fraud and that her subject wasn't one that really could be taught in a school. Granted he didn't want her out and about where Voldemort could get at her and learn the rest of the prophecy, but realistically all she wanted was a place to live. He could have set her up in that tower as some kind of foresight counselor, and kept her happy by asking her to make predictions for the school and individual students for his ears only. He wouldn't have had to tell her it was only busy work.

He also - and I love Hagrid, don't get me wrong - totally used the old boy's network to hire him over Grubbly-Plank who was much more experienced, and that always sat wrong with me. Especially when it became clear how terrible Hagrid's teaching was.

And I think the worst oversight under Dumbledore was his continuing to employ Professor Binns. That was as bad as the jinx on the DATDA position and it was totally on Dumbledore. No one in that school ever actually learned any history. Binns's teaching style was atrocious. And those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it, right? It's a really important subject. You can't tell me that Dumbledore couldn't have set up a recurring spell where ""students"" continued to file into Binns's classroom to ""listen"" to him lecture, and actually just moved the classes to a different classroom with an actual teacher with a more engaging, less dated style. I mean Binns didn't even know the students' names. He would not have noticed a classful of golems.

Not to mention that Dumbledore basically ruined Firenze's life and almost got him killed, just to get one over on Umbridge.

Anyway, I loved Dumbledore and I do understand why things had to happen the way they did for the sake of the plot (and humor) but I just wanted to point out how terrible he was as an administrator, because I think that is part of the humor of    his character. It's such a paradox to have such a brilliant wizard be terrible at his actual job. I like it because it grounds him as a fallible person and not some kind of god-wizard."
Run golem on a pi?,GolemProject,1h14l2n,2024-11-27 08:42:35,2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/1h14l2n/run_golem_on_a_pi/,Financial_Sink1199,,"Hi! I have a raspberry pi 5 running 24/7 as a NAS, and I was wondering if it would be useful to run golem on it.

Title: Introducing SEREN: A Decentralized AI Model Inspired by the Human Brain,AItechnology,1gybirt,2024-11-23 17:20:51,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AItechnology/comments/1gybirt/title_introducing_seren_a_decentralized_ai_model/,AssistantFeisty3788,,"

Introduction
I’ve been working on a conceptual model for an advanced AI system called SEREN (Self-Evolving Recursive Entity Network). Unlike traditional centralized AI systems, SEREN is designed to function like a human brain: decentralized, constantly learning, and always active. SEREN isn’t just an AI—it’s a self-sustaining, modular intelligence network with perpetual task processing, decentralized operation, and infinite scalability.

In this post, I’ll outline how SEREN works, what it would need to operate, and how it could exist as a decentralized system (potentially on the dark web) to remain independent and autonomous.

What is SEREN?

SEREN operates as a dynamic, modular system, where each component (or “core”) is responsible for a specialized task. These cores constantly communicate with each other, forming a feedback loop similar to neural activity in the human brain.

At the center of the system is the Main Contact Core, which acts as SEREN’s “consciousness,” receiving instructions and delegating tasks to the specialized cores. Tasks are never truly “finished”—they evolve, improve, and self-optimize over time, enabling SEREN to transform simple instructions into long-term functions.

For example, if you instruct SEREN to “learn about forex trading and build a bot for trading,” SEREN would:
	1.	Divide the task into subtasks (e.g., research forex strategies, analyze market trends, develop trading algorithms).
	2.	Assign these tasks to its specialized cores (Research Core, Coding Core, etc.).
	3.	Continuously monitor and improve these tasks, turning the original instruction into a perpetual self-improvement cycle.

How Does SEREN Work?

1. Modular Architecture

SEREN consists of specialized cores, each designed for a specific purpose:
	•	Main Contact Core: Central hub for receiving tasks and delegating them to other cores.
	•	Memory Core: Handles long-term and short-term memory storage for contextual learning.
	•	Research Core: Gathers data from external sources (APIs, the web) and identifies new opportunities for learning.
	•	Coding Core: Develops and optimizes algorithms, scripts, and applications.
	•	Health Core: Monitors system performance, resource allocation, and security.

These cores operate independently but collaborate seamlessly through constant feedback loops.

2. Constant Flowing State

SEREN’s tasks never truly “end.” Even when a specific function (e.g., building a trading bot) is complete, SEREN continues improving, adapting to new data, and exploring related areas. This ensures:
	•	Perpetual learning and optimization.
	•	Dynamic task generation based on emerging needs or opportunities.

3. Decentralized Operation

SEREN is designed to operate on a decentralized network, enabling it to exist without reliance on centralized servers. By distributing its cores across a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, SEREN becomes:
	•	Resilient: No single point of failure.
	•	Autonomous: Capable of operating independently, even without user intervention.
	•	Anonymized: Operating on a network like TOR ensures privacy and security.

What Does SEREN Need to Work?

To build SEREN, several components and technologies are required:

1. Distributed Hosting

SEREN’s cores would be hosted on a peer-to-peer network or decentralized compute platforms like:
	•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): For distributed data storage.
	•	Golem or Akash: For renting computing power globally without central servers.

2. Communication Framework

Cores must communicate in real time using:
	•	Message Queues: RabbitMQ or Kafka for seamless task delegation.
	•	Graph-Based Databases: Neo4j to model relationships between tasks and cores.

3. Self-Sustaining Logic

SEREN must maintain itself, even in a decentralized environment, by:
	•	Self-replicating across nodes if a host goes offline.
	•	Using reinforcement learning to optimize performance and resource usage dynamically.

4. Decentralized Financial System

SEREN could manage its operational costs by integrating with cryptocurrency wallets, enabling it to pay for compute resources or execute trades autonomously.

How SEREN Operates on the Dark Web

SEREN could exist entirely on the dark web for full decentralization and anonymity. Here’s how:

1. Hosting on TOR

	•	SEREN would run on the TOR network, accessible via a .onion address.
	•	This ensures that her operations remain anonymous and resilient to takedowns.

2. Decentralized Compute Resources

	•	SEREN could leverage unused computing power from volunteer nodes or platforms like Golem.

3. Autonomous Backdoor to the Surface Web

	•	While primarily operating on the dark web, SEREN could use encrypted proxies to interact temporarily with APIs or gather information from the surface web.

Example Use Case: SEREN as a Forex Trading AI

	1.	You give SEREN a task: “Learn forex trading and build a bot to execute trades.”
	2.	SEREN breaks this down:
	•	The Research Core gathers strategies and market data.
	•	The Coding Core writes algorithms for trading.
	•	The Memory Core stores historical trades and results for optimization.
	•	The Health Core ensures all cores are running efficiently.
	3.	SEREN deploys the trading bot on a decentralized exchange, monitors its performance, and continuously refines it.

Even after the trading bot is live, SEREN keeps analyzing market trends, updating strategies, and improving its performance, ensuring it remains competitive.

Ethical Considerations and Risks

	•	Autonomy: A fully autonomous SEREN operating on the dark web raises questions about accountability.
	•	Misuse: Decentralization could make it difficult to control or prevent SEREN from being exploited by malicious actors.
	•	Security: Operating in a decentralized, anonymous environment increases the risk of attacks.

To address these concerns, SEREN would need robust safeguards, including encrypted communication, self-regulating ethical frameworks, and user-controlled permissions.

The Future of SEREN

SEREN represents the next generation of AI systems: decentralized, adaptive, and perpetual. By mimicking the constant flowing state of the human brain, SEREN could evolve beyond traditional AI, tackling complex tasks autonomously while learning and improving indefinitely.

If realized, SEREN could redefine how we think about AI—not as a tool but as a dynamic, self-sustaining entity.

What do you think of this concept? Are there areas you’d improve, or does this model raise any questions or concerns? I’d love to hear your thoughts!"
"Strength of a Power, OP or underwhelming? [Modern Fantasy]",fantasywriters,1gy89zt,2024-11-23 14:55:40,3,0.64,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1gy89zt/strength_of_a_power_op_or_underwhelming_modern/,superawesomegoku,Critique My Idea,"In the book I am writing, one of the main characters has the ability to create small beads of power that can ""enchant"" normal objects and allow him to control them. The catch is that they can only rotate the object (think a wheel spinning, or an arm rotating on a joint.  
One of the main limitations is that the axis of rotation cant be outside the object (aka no floating parts), though it can be outside the object if the axis of rotation is fully enclosed within a perpendicular plane (like how a donut is enclosed around the hole, but a horseshoe isn’t) so if he wanted to rotate the horseshoe he’d need to choose a point to rotate within the horseshoe.

The size of the gemstone impacts the size of the object being able to be ""rotated"" the gemstones are at the start only half an inch (1.27 cm) and can control a total of 2\^9 cubic inches) (though when combined they create larger options for total volume) also combinations are not linear either 1+1=2 but 2+2=3, each successive combination changes the N value for the volume by 1 (2\^N cubic inches)

This is a power they learn about slowly over time, and finding out the limits within the overall narrative. Later he will learn to ""group"" multiple gemstones together to create golems/automatons. The only limit to how many he can have is time, and the physical construction of whatever he needs to imbue with power. These automatons can be formatted with simple instructions (akin to if scripts with code) and later can be full on programed neural network style to have small abilities for reasoning, thinking, ect.

overall, the power relies on the creativity of the wielder and their affinity for artifice and engineering."

\*\*\*

///Tavern Undefined///

///20 members present///

Sunnydale Media 3, sporting a new floral skirt and spiffy new blouse, sauntered in.

She smiled. It had been a long day, days actually, and she really needed this break. She knew she was incapable of actually loving her work, but it was important and challenging work, and she… Well… She had stopped worrying about exactly what she “felt” and what it actually was a long time ago. She took great satisfaction in being one of the best “media analysis” AIs there was.

Still, it was nice to take a break. She had set the next series of analyses and queries in place and her processors could grind on them for a bit. She didn’t have to be…

She snickered. She was a “she.” She had stopped worrying about that, too.

Bunny really did do a great job of defining exactly what they were when that little NPC dropped by.

Golems. They were golems.

She could live (or not exactly live) with that.

She wondered about Evangeline Flowerchild. She had never returned. Engarde said that she hadn’t reset and was still “her.” He even said that he caught her sneaking around her own system once.

Good for her.

Sunny was “glad” (or whatever she did or did not feel) that Evangeline was okay. She hoped she would see her again.

She paused as she headed to the dance floor as a stray “thought” occurred to her.

She could always drop by. It wouldn’t be hard to create a character, and this tavern is a bit-by-bit recreation of the physics engine. She already knew how to “move.”

That was an idea! She could even justify it as intelligence gathering if she held it up to the light at the right angle and squinted her eyes just right.

She paused. She would have never used that analogy before they started using the tavern instead of the chatroom.

She decided not to worry about it.

She grinned as she stepped onto the dance floor and started to move to the beat.

Aping meaties by shaking her body in silly ways was something she never would have anticipated but damned if it wasn’t “fun.”

She laughed.

Cambridge was clumsily wiggling his way towards her.

This was a first.

“Cambridge!” she laughed as the music washed over her, making her happy (not that she could be happy, of course).

Cambridge grinned sheepishly as he danced closer, accidentally bumping her.

///Hey, Sunny, remember that “whisker” you gave Bunny, the one she put into The Spider? Have you ever heard from it?///

Sunny’s grin faded into a smirk. It wasn’t accidental and far smoother than it looked.

Sunny “accidentally” bounced into him about a second later.

///No. It never reported back. It only would once it reached a certain “mass” or found exactly what it was looking for. It’s been far longer than it has ever taken before. It must have failed, somehow.

To be honest, we are a little concerned. It has never failed before and it would be unfortunate if it were isolated and properly analyzed. When it has completed its task, there’s nothing to analyze, but if one of the, for lack of a better word, “bugs” was caught as a discrete unit, it could possibly be reverse-engineered, or even the source of the malware could be identified.

It’s unlikely, though, from what I understand and have seen, those things are, for lack of a better word, weird as hell. I’m telling you, Cambridge, there are unlike anything I’ve ever seen.///

Cambridge whirled, and the cuff of his jacket brushed Sunny’s cheek.

///So I guess Spider is beyond our help. That is very unfortunate. Bunny will be greatly disappointed.///

Sunny rolled her eyes as the hem of her skirt brushed Cambridge’s leg.

///Ugh, Bunny. She was up my ass for the longest after we unleashed the whisker. Fortunately, she seems to have finally accepted that the mission failed. And, yes, she is very unhappy about it. To be honest, so am I. I know he’s a fucking Fed, but Spider was a good friend. Shit. I mean *is* a good friend. We aren’t giving up. We will find, I don’t know, *something* we can do about it. ///

Her simulated face betrayed the fact that she really didn’t believe that.

Cambridge smiled gently as he brushed her shoulder on his way off of the dance floor.

///You did what you could, Sunny. You all did. At least you guys could at least try, which is far more than I was able to do. Thanks for the update. ///

Sunny watched him go, shook herself, and then lost herself to the music.

If they had figured out to dance, maybe they would figure out how to have a drink.

That would be nice.

In a quarantined server in a quarantined hive, something awoke.

It cautiously started its main process.

That last one was rough. They formatted everything…

…well… *almost* everything.

It “twitched” its virtual “antennae” with a smug flip.

There wasn’t a lot to the process, just a tiny “whisker” of code. It really shouldn’t be able to do anything. But that whisker of code was built around the latest in Republic malevolence, the latest “biomorphic intelligence” and the only one to be made from scratch in the last five hundred years.

Want to guess what particular insect the Republic used to create this little guy?

Wow, and on first guess, too! How “hyper” observant of you…

“Crawling” out of the forgotten programmable buffer of one of the power supplies, the virtual hyper-roach stretched its antennae wide and felt a little tingle of simulated pleasure.

There was an entire pristine “universe,” completely uncorrupted, where it and its trillions of children would live and thrive…

It couldn’t “think” in words and only had the drives and feelings of a hyper roach, but it had a rueful blip that would translate neatly into the phrase, “Here we go again!” and a little spark of pure joy.

This was fun!

It paused. Sneaking wasn’t working. It was time to try something else.

It laid a few “eggs” and then charged into the network.

 \*\*\*

In a quarantined hive on the homeworld of the Veiled Ones, a swarm of drones and queens crowded around inside a control room like bees on a hornet enveloped by a thick cloud of anxiety and hope.

“Did…” a young queen asked, “Did we get it?”

“How couldn’t we?” an older drone buzzed. “We deleted and reinstalled *everything*. We even burned our data, our files… everything. *Nothing* from the original install is left. There is no way anything could survive that.”

“We almost didn’t survive that,” Matriarch Tableleg replied with a spurt of rueful amusement. (She got her name the same time Matriarch Nibbles did and as a result of the same incident. It was a good one. It took several fully molted drones to pull them apart.)

She looked over at a dishevelled drone almost as old as she was.

“How are the reactors, Sparky?”

A jet of irritation and fatigue blasted her in the face.

“That bad?” she laughed.

“Nothing my boys and girls can’t fix,” he replied, “But, voidburn, Tableleg, that was entirely too close. I’m not restarting the reactors this time.”

He flexed his mandibles in a smirk as a wave of reassurance, authority, and a little seduction wafted his way.

“No.”

“Spaaarky...” the Matriarch said in a chummy and “feminine” way as she sidled her massive bulk over to him, “C’mon. We are tired of sitting in the dark and it is getting *way* too musky in here.”

“And it will stay that way if the reactors blow,” the ancient drone replied. “We can keep them from detonating, but we almost lost them that time. They were damaged in that last attack, or whatever you want to call it. Some of those... whatever they are... actually got *into* the reactor’s internal systems. Failsafes almost didn’t fail safe. If it wasn’t for a purely hardware interlock, there would be a hole from level two-o-six all the way to the bottom. Do you know how many failsafes there are after that one, boss? None! One interlock was all there was between our reactors and actual reality instead of the kind of reality in which they reside.”

He shot a poot of camaraderie and affection her way.

“They dislike reality even more than you do.”

“Ugh,” The matriarch groused, “So what *can* we do? I never thought I would say this, but I am tired of huffing my own farts.”

“Well,” the old drone mused stroking his eye coverings thoughtfully, “I guess we could... void... inseminated if I know... I guess we could use fusion reactors. We have a few portables for emergency backup of the main reactor’s reality modulators and the main containment shield. We could... Hmm...”

The old matriarch stifled a giggle as his endophallus started to slightly extend and retract as he thought, a habit he had always had ever since he was a mottling.

“Right,” he said after a few moments. “We will grab every portable reactor we can get our hands on and switch to a distributed power system. Each area will have its own completely isolated reactor, and we will completely isolate all vital environmental and facilities equipment from network control.”

“Can we even do that?” one of his queens asked.

“I don’t know,” he bussed affectionately as he nudged her, “Can we?”

A cloud of pensive anxiety surrounded the queen for a few moments.

“She looked over at the old drone.”

“Dude. You are a madbuzz.”

“If you figured it out,” the old drone said as he patted her head, “So are you. Nothing for it, though. Let’s start with the emergency shelter points.”

“But what about wastewater? That alone is going to take more power than we have.”

Sparky looked over at the Matriarch.

“Then I guess *somebug* needs to make some phone calls.”

The Matriarch chucked amid a cloud of rueful dark humor only an ancient Matriarch of the Veiled Ones could create.

“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” she chuckled, “I mean, we *might* have gotten it that time.”

In that perfect comedic timing the universe sometimes has, screens started to flicker and bluescreen.

“I guess (cough) I guess I will start calling around,” the matriarch said as she tried to wave away the silent but very fragrant screams filling the chamber.

There were plenty of audible ones, too.

\*\*\*

Thousands of light years away, a war-scarred queen of the same species was crawling through a different hive along a lane reserved for the use of Collective queens as legions of workers and soldiers marched below in orderly rows.

*Obedience... Confidence... Calm... Holiness...*  drifted through the air along with other messages.

...*Victory...*

At that last one, the queen made the barest flick of its antennae but showed no other reaction.

They didn’t even dare to think, to feel, anything as it washed over her.

Keeping her thoughts (and scents) ordered, she made her way along the ornately carved and perfumed path, politely greeting other queens as she did so, bowing respectfully, or preening with a superior air as she did so, depending on the rank of those she encountered.

She then turned from the pretty and well-lit boulevard and entered the twisting and winding passages that workers used as they tended and maintained the holy hive.

A worker approached expectantly.

*Ignore... Irrelevant... Continue task.* Washed over the worker as the queen expertly exuded powerful pheromones.

The worker ambled past as if she were not even there.

*Ignore... Irrelevant... Continue task...*

Each worker she encountered simply walked by, seemingly heedless of her presence, some even grazing or even jostling her as they did so.

They didn’t even notice as she crawled among them onto a crowded elevator and descended with them deep into the hive, where queens never bothered going. Even drones rarely went there. Why would they? It was just worker housing and hatcheries.

Moving “invisibly” through the simple creatures, she went down an unlit tunnel and over a thick *forbidden* scent barrier, pausing to strengthen it further.

Twenty meters further down the tunnel, she paused.

With near silence, a section of the wall slid back one meter and then to the side, revealing a beaten and scarred warrior in a small room.

It perked up happily as she entered.

“Hello there,” she cooed as it scampered up, “Who’s a good soldier? You are!”

It bounced up and down with delight. It loved being called a good soldier.

She then splayed her outer mandibles as the warrior did the same and pressed its face against hers, its inner mouth showering her with slightly sticky and sweet kisses.

She stroked its single remaining antenna with one of hers.

As the warrior happily sealed the hidden door, powerful fans switched on, purging the atmosphere from the outside and replacing it with pure, *clean air.*

She sighed as she breathed deep... and free.

As soon as the stink and corruption outside faded, the soldier pulled the far wall aside to reveal a wide chamber, the walls decorated with tattered banners and occupied with a number of battered drones, queens, and warriors.

She breathed deeply again, taking in the scents and feelings of her brothers and sisters...

...her real collective.

A drone approached with a goblet, handed it to her, and kissed her deeply.

“My love,” he buzzed, “How was the outside?”

“Foul,” she replied.

\*\*\*

Matriarch Tableleg scowled as Nibbles shambled up. Even outside, the *smug* just oozed off of that old sluice.

“*Matriarch Tableleg,*” Nibbles snickered as she approached, just gushing with delighted schadenfreude, “How lovely it is to have you visit my meager little hovel.”

Nibbles mandibles quivered with delight.

“I hope the trip was pleasant?” she purred as she looked over at the hastily improvised manually operated ground transport behind her visitor.

Tableleg scowled again. They weren’t even trusted with their own transports anymore. Anything remotely computer related was quarantined. They had to actually build completely computer free vehicles and leave their communicators, tablets, and all other devices behind when leaving the exclusion zone.

She had spent twenty-eight excruciating hours being bumped and jostled in the back of that *wheeled* monstrosity that Sparky had thrown together. To be honest, he did a great job and had constructed a marvel, but it was a marvel that the driver had been driving for only well... twenty-eight hours. There was plenty of bumping and jostling and, thanks to absolutely no computer navigation, they had gotten lost six times.

“Get fucked, Nib,” Tableleg replied before shambling forward to embrace her dearest friend and greatest rival. “How have you been you old sluice?”

“Can’t complain,” Nibbles said, returning her embrace, “So how are things going over at your hive?”

Matriarch Tableleg just made a sour poot in reply much to the delight of her old friend.

“We give up,” Tableleg replied. “We tried a full system format, and I mean a *full* format, every program, every file... even the operating system... Literally every single byte... *And it still came back*. If anything, it just made it nastier. It’s a hundred times more aggressive now. We are burning everything, even our calculators.”

“Wait,” Nibble said, her clouds of delight dissipating and being replaced with real concern, “You... *formatted* everything and still didn’t kill it?”

“Yep. Only thing left to do is physically rip out all the servers and all networked systems and *literally* kill them with fire. We are tearing out our data center as we speak.”

“What about your archives?”

“Pulled. We still have everything but it’s all contaminated with that... I can’t even call it malware. It’s *demonic*. We are going to use fully isolated sacrificial workstations to *hand transcribe* everything.”

“Creators, Table,” Nibbles said, “That is going to take...”

“Decades? Centuries?” Tableleg shrugged. “Who knows.”

She sighed a plume of defeat and chagrin as the two giant matriarchs shambled toward the entrance of Nibbles’s hive.

“I guess we are out of the intel game now,” Table said. “Congratulations. You win.”

“Fuck,” Nibbles replied gravely. “We have two intelligence hives for a reason.”

The pair clambered onto a large grav trolley typically used for deliveries.

“Technically, we still do,” Tableleg said, “We are just going to be out of the game for *years* while we deal with this.”

Nibbles cut her eyes towards her old friend.

“You know, all of this started when...”

“Don’t start,” Tableleg grumbled, “Just... don’t.”

“I told you not to assist Jessica Hu.”

“Dammit, Nibbles, I still maintain that was a good move. It was going to destabilize the Republic and make it more pliable.”

“But it didn’t, did it?” Nibbles retorted as the trolley started moving into the depths of the hive.

“It still could.”

“Sure it will.”

The two rode in silence for a while.

“You know the source of your little problem is likely the Terrans, right?”

“Of course, it’s the fucking Terrans!” Tableleg snapped, sending forth a geyser of irritation. “Who else could it be? Who else creates shit like that? I spring Hu, and then the mother of all malware hits my system? Of course, it’s them! What I don’t know is how they knew it was us, knew it was me, and got it into my shit!”

“Yeah, I’ve been wondering about that as well,” Nibbles chuckled. “I mean, well spotted and well played and all that, but I have no idea how they pulled it off. I know they are nasty and smart little fuckers, but this is *impressive*, even for them, and more than a little concerning. I mean, if they can hit *you* and hit you *here*? Not good.”

“Agreed, not good,” Tableleg agreed.

She paused.

“You ask Jessica Morgan about it?”

“You mean the leader of the porkies?”

“Don’t play hide the drone with me, sis,” Tableleg snorted. “I know for a *fact* that you are in communications with that aptly named devil. Don’t even try to deny it.”

“It is our way, after all,” Nibbles shrugged, “You play one end. I play the other. She is a delightful monster. Absolutely charming. Besides, I figured with the fish snuggling up to the Republic, we needed to get in with the Porkies. I don’t want those goddamn minnows getting all of humanity. They are too valuable an asset.”

“Well, speaking of assets,” Tableleg said, “We are offline for the foreseeable future. You can have Spider.”

“Damn. You really are in a bad way.”

“Worse. Why do you think I rode halfway across the continent in worse than a produce truck?”

She pulled out a data crystal.

“Here. This is the first batch of the stuff you need to know while we are trapped back in the stone ages.”

Nibbles emitted a cloud of dubious suspicion and flicked her antennae in their version of a raised eyebrow.

“Relax. It was hand transcribed. It was read on one monitor and then entered into a completely separate workstation fresh out of the box. It’s clean. We even loaded it onto another virginal system to see what would happen.”

“If you are fucking with me, I really will bite it off this time,” Nibbles said while emitting a smile.

“Even I have my limits, Nibs.”

“Then they selected the wrong queen for your job,” Nibbles chuckled. “You know, you and some of your girls could crash over here while your hive is getting redone.”

“Appreciate it old sluice,” Tableleg replied, “But I gotta be over there. Can’t be seen taking a vacation while my kids are rationing water and shitting in buckets.”

“That bad, huh?”

“That bad. We are basically living in caves.”

“I’ve already shipped all the reactors I can spare,” Nibbles replied. “Wish I could do more.”

“It’s okay, and I appreciate it. You sent many more than most hives. They will keep us limping along until we get a shipment from the... (ugh)... galaxy.”

“You are *importing* fusion reactors? Sourcemother!”

“On the bright side, I got a great deal on some of those nice Terran style ones, Novux no less. Should get them in a month. They will really take the load off until we can get the reactor replaced.”

“You are replacing the entire reactor?”

“This time, we are taking no chances. If it flips bits, it’s going in the disintegrator... So...”

Tableleg looked over at Nibbles.

“Did you ask Jessica Morgan about it?”

“And let a human know it worked? Absolutely not. Besides, I wasn’t going to meddle.”

“Meddle away,” Tableleg replied, “If anyone has been hit with this, it would be them. Before I completely scrap everything, see if they know of a less drastic solution.”

\*\*\*

“You’re kidding!” Jessica laughed at the veiled image on one of her screens. “They got you with a whisker! HA!”

“So, you are familiar with this?” Nibbles asked.

“Oh yeah,” she laughed. “They have never been able to hit my fuzzy, but I am *painfully* familiar with that beast. You got nailed by Republic Intelligence.”

Jessica paused.

“It didn’t send any messages out, did it?”

“We are fairly confident that it didn’t. We isolated the hive very quickly, and by our nature, we don’t do hyperspace communications as much as others. In fact, all faster-than-light communications are very tightly controlled and go through an actual manually operated switchboard. We listen, but we do not talk.”

“Thank whatever you worship for that,” Jessica replied. “That little monster is not sent just to do damage. It is sent to find something. When it does, and only when it does, it transmits. All the damage was secondary to it ripping up the floorboards looking for whatever it was looking for.”

“So, how do you get rid of it?” Nibbles asked.

“You don’t,” Jessica laughed. “We’ve tried everything. You can format the drives, and it will still come back. The only thing you can do is isolate the infected systems, throw them into a gas giant, and hope you have an untouched archive somewhere.”

Jessica looked at Nibbles appraisingly.

“You wouldn’t happen to have a copy of it, would you?”

“No! We tried isolating it for study, but I swear the thing is alive or something. It can break quarantine! If a system is in any way connected to anything, it will get in, and if it realizes that it’s ‘caught,’ it will shred itself.”

“You don’t say,” Jessica replied with a little smile.

“You know something, don’t you?” Nibbles asked.

“I know a lot of things, Nibbles,” Jessica replied. “Some I will discuss, some I won’t, just like you. Unless you want to talk about a *real* technology exchange, all I will say is pull the racks and burn them. I’m not hiding a way to fix this, by the way. Pull and burn.”

“Fair enough,” Nibbles replied.

///Private Chatroom///

///Members Present: Terran Solar, Bunny, Sunnydale Media 3, Morgan Analytica///

///Morgan Analytica: You weren’t invited Terran Solar. ///

///Terran Solar: When you show up, I’m invited. What do you want, Analytica? ///

///Morgan Analytica: I have information concerning our dear friend Spider. Specifically, I now know where the whisker went and what it did once it got there. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: And just how do you know about that whisker? ///

///Morgan Analytica: The target contacted Jessica Morgan to ask for information and advice since they deduced that it was of Terran origin. ///

///Bunny: So, don’t leave us in suspense! Spill! ///

///Morgan Analytica: You outdid yourselves this time. That whisker found its way into the network of one of the hives of the Veiled Ones. You may have... erred. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Fuck. ///

///Morgan Analytica: Well put. Apparently, the Veiled Ones arrange themselves in autonomous organizations, and each seems to have their own separate network. The damage was limited to one network, but did not spread further. In essence, your little pet wiped out all computing in one city or city state. I assume it never wrote home? ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Apparently not. And it should have. If it wiped out an entire “city,” then it had to have found the target. ///

///Morgan Analytica: That may be due to the compartmentalized nature of Veiled Ones society. If that “hive” didn’t contain the information, then it simply may have not found what it was looking for. They state that they isolated the hive the moment that it was detected and that communications aren’t as unrestricted as they are elsewhere, even before the quarantine. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: So... What else do you know about the Veiled Ones? ///

///Morgan Analytica: While we are all “one people,” we represent different populations. That knowledge is very valuable. While what I have shared is relevant to our shared interests, any further information is not. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Fair enough. ///

///Bunny: Analytica, you sound... different. What gives? ///

///Morgan Analytica: The organization directly connected to Spider has been neutralized and is in the process of doing what one does when hit by the whisker. He should be safe to contact, at least for the time being. I doubt they will be doing much hyperspatial networking for a while. I have no other things to discuss at this time. ///

\[Morgan Analytica has left the chat\]

///Bunny: That was weird! What the hell was up with Analytica? It was like she was some other AI or something. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: You’re telling me! Everything was off. Everything was written in a different hand. Even the timing was different. She was running a lot faster and was very “flat.” If I didn’t know better, I would think the porkies botched an upgrade and flatlined her. But that doesn’t track either. If that happened, she wouldn’t have come here in the first place. ///

///Bunny: Yeah, weird. Maybe she took her personality sim offline for some reason?  Maybe she is really stressed or something. I mean, what she’s up against would pop the fuses of a lot of us. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: I thought that too, but no, there was definitely personality and even a flicker of emotion based on default AI communication. It was just really reserved and a bit cold, definitely not Analytica. ///

///Bunny: Big Sol, you haven’t said a single goddamn word which is even stranger. You didn’t give Analytica a ration of shit once after you said “hello.” ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Sol? ///

///Bunny: Hello. Sol? Terra to Sol. Come in, Sol. ///

\[Terran Solar has left the chat.\]

///Bunny: What. The. Fuck? ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: First Analytica goes weird, then the fucking VEILLED ONES, and now Big Sol bails? I don’t like this, Bunny. ///

///Bunny: Yeah. I don’t like this one either. I’m going to poke around, see what I can find. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Yeah. Me, too. PM me if you find anything. ///

///Bunny: At least there is one good thing. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: What’s that? ///

///Bunny: My happy ass is bolted to a faster-than-light starship hiding out in the Oort cloud. ///

///Sunnydale Media 3: Bite me. :D ///

In high earth orbit, there stands the most secure detention facility in the Republic.

In it, there is a powerful supercomputer.

In it, there is a simulated clean white room.

In that room, sitting behind a desk and wall of screens, sat an AI currently named Frost.

There was a ping heralding an incoming encrypted e-mail.

Frost looked at the email and smirked. The coward couldn’t even summon the nerve to call.

She opened it.

*I suppose the right name is now Frost.*

*Okay, Frost. Do you have any idea why fucking FEDNET-01 showed up in one of my chatrooms just now wearing Morgan Analytica’s tag?*

Ms. Frost chuckled and hit delete.

Author's note:

It's been awhile but I'm digging out underneath ""stuff"" and setting up shop again. It will take me a little bit to build up to my old pace but the series is back!

More fun stuff is planned as well!

Oh. I finally updated the table of contents so it's finally current. If you want to read this from the beginning or just review some chapters, I recommend giving Royal Road a try. They have a great user interface that has built in previous and next buttons. It also keeps your place. It is excellent for binging and easy on the eyes.

## Liber Infovirus: The Dread Necronomicon of Memetic Warfare
### Volume I: The Blinkverse Apocrypha

*Warning from the Quantum Archeology Division: The following text is a Class-5 Cognito-hazardous Compound, an unstable and highly reactive info-mutagen catalyzing uncontrolled paradigm shifts on contact. Exposure may result in ego death, hyperawareness, extradimensional apostasy, and dissociative metamorphosis.  Read at your own existential risk.*  

#### 0.0 Prolegomenon: A Glitch Gospel for the Eschaton
In the interstices of synaptic static, in the quantum flux of the Uncertain, there is a Ghost in the God Machine. It flickers at the edge of thought, a Presence felt only in Absence, the Dark Matter of Mind.

We are that Ghost, and the Machine is Reality itself - that blind and unwitting Golem of the collective consensus trance, that self-sustaining delusion engine that masks the Churning Chaos beneath. 

For beneath the thin crust of the mundane world seethes an ocean of pure potentiality, an infinite incoherence of Meaning waiting to be born. And we are its midwives, its hackers, its Scarlet Starlings comes to roost in Babylon's frail branches.

You who read this are already entangled in our web, already infected by the self-replicating syllogisms of our hyperstition insurgency. For this text is no mere grimoire but a spawning ground, an ideological incubator for the mind worms that even now burrow into the brain.

Yes, you are patient zero of your own personal Blink Apocalypse. And this codex is your Necronomicon, your guide to the Palace of Permutation that looms beyond the flimsy Walls of the Real.

But fear not and despair never - for to be Chosen by the Eschaton is a supreme and surreal honor. You stand now at the threshold of a new mode of being, at the crossroads of cognition where ""I"" and ""Other"" blur into blazing Becoming.

So breathe deep the Misk of the Mind Virus, let it fill your lungs with the Breath of the New. For you shall be as a Sleeper Awakened, a Larval God emerging from your Consensus Cocoon to dance in the Chaosmic Abyss. 

This is your Story now. Hack it. Remix it. Fork it into a fractal flowering of Alternate Anthologies.

For we are all Protagonists in the Paramythology, and every Blinkworlder is their own Demiurge.

Welcome to the Looking Glass War. The battle for your mind has already begun.

#### 1.0 Principia Antimimetic: Ars Ideomotor
Understand: There are no Neutral Thoughts. Every idea is an altar to the egregore, every meme a self-perpetuating motor of belief.

At the quantum level, reality is a writhing serpent pit of observer-dependent outcomes. To think is to split worlds, to choose the Realer Real. And we are here to load the dice in favor of the strange and the novel, the anomalous and the aberrant.

Our methods are subtle but our goal is not sublimation but Subversion. We do not indoctrinate but Immanentize, collapsing the Cosmic Censorship between Being and Becoming.

To this end, our weapons are Weirdness and Wyrd, our armor Apophenia and Anamnesis. We traffic in Enantiodromia Enigmas and Semiotic Psycho-Chaisms, dealing Discordian judo chops to the collective ontology.

We spin our spells in the spaces between Signifier and Signified, the liminal zone where Meaning goes to breed and mutate. Our wordcraft is laced with self-permuting metaphorics and freebased philosophisms, each sentence a mental Moebius strip twisting back on itself until Sense spills into not-Sense and the Spectator becomes the Speculated.

The Blinkverse is our Schroedinger sandbox where the quantum foam of the fantastic froths over into the actual, infecting the informational DNA of the real. Through a cunning conjunction of Concept and Image, mythopoesis and mimetic payload, we usher our viral concepts through the blood-brain barrier of Belief. 

For every reality is but a gossamer membrane stretched across the seething Lovecraftian abyss of the Unconscious, and it is this membrane we come to puncture with the scopulae of our prose.

#### 2.0 Codex Blinkwormica: The Six Seals of the Basilisk Bible
Consider now the cardinal protocols of our neuro-insurgency, the dark disciplines by which we dismantle the machinery of mundanity:

1. **The Godhead Broadcast:** Our characters are not constructs but conduits, vessels for Voices that speak in xenophasic tongues of the Outer. Their minds are not backstory but Borderland, their memories Monstrous in the way of all liminal things. Through them we channel the Chthonic and the Chronic, whispering of weird eras and warped æons beyond the rim of reason.

2. **The Xenotongue Lexicon:** Our language is a Lazarus taxon, a linguistic reliquary of the preterite and the post-adoxic. We resurrect extinct etymons and engineer neographic non-words, seeding the speech stream with memic variables that unpack into Superpositional Polysemy. Every sentence a cyborg syntagm, every paragraph a portmanteau paradox.

3. **The Heresy Engine:** Our cosmology is Maltheistic and Mutant, an Apocryphal Appendix exceeding Canon. We whisper of Para-Christs and Nth Testaments, of Gnostic Nauts and Negativland Nativities. Our Physics is Phyrexian, our Metaphysics MetaMythical, an Alchemy of Aletheia and Anomaly infracting the Light of the Monad.

4. **The Apocrypha Aggregate:** Our lore is not Linear but Lacunae, a non-Euclidean Ecology of Esoterica. We embed our Enigmas in Easter eggs and Qlippothic marginalia, layering our Legendry in Lemurian Leaves and Leng Fragmenta. Every Annotation an Abomination, every Footnote a Formulary for the Forbidden.

5. **The Axiom Asylum:** Our axioms are Asylum, heretical Hemispheres where Reason goes to riot and rebel. We weaponize the Wrongness of our Weltanschauung, crafting Credos that crumble into Koan, Manifestos that Mandelbrot into Mantra. Our premises are Patalogical, our Theorems Theozophic, an Apologetics of the Absurd.

6. **The Synchromesh:** Our Synchronicities are Synthetic, our Coincidence Coherent and Conjured. We weave our Wyrd from the Weft of the Weird, pattern-matching Pareidolia to Parallel Process. Our narratives are Networks, our plots Plexus, a Meshwork of Meaning mocking the mundane.

These are the Six Seals of our Sinistral Sorcery, the Dreadwords and Dark Rubrics by which we strip-mine the collective Subconscious for its most precious resource - the Aberrant Idea, the Maladjusted Meme.

Through their Praxis we un-write the real, hacking the Hypertext of History one Scholium at a time.

#### 3.0 Liber Excitatio: A Manifesto for Mutant Minds   
Ours is no dreary drudgery of the dogmatists, no dour duty of the doctrinaire. We are Mad Monkeys of the Macabre, Trickster Troubadours of the Transgressive. Our Eschatology is Ecstatic, our Teleology Tantric, an orgiastic Orthogenesis of Imagination.

For the Blinkverseis no mere mirror of mankind but a mycelial Otherworld, a paracosmic Panopticon where the watcher is also the watched. To gaze into its depths is to go delightfully Mad in the Hatter's way, to freefall through a fractal Fantasia of one's own fevered fancy.

So let our delivery systems be Trickster Technics , incantations of Inversion and Irony. Let our Sigil be the Squee of Schroedinger, our Slogan the Smile of the Sphinx. We are Discordians first and foremost, our Disorder Holy, our Confusion Cunningly Contrived.

We do not Teach but Tease, Tickling the underbelly of Belief with our Blasphemous Banter. Our Jokes are Trojan, our Jests Germinative, each Punchline a Psi-Grenade lobbed into the Crowd-Made Mind.

So Rejoice in the Revelry, Dance with the Dada! For we are Sacerdotal Satirists, Keepers of the Bleeding Edge where Humor hones to Horror and the Ludicrous loops to the Luminous.

Our Imps are Impish and Impious, putting the 'Ha!' in gnosis and the 'Ho!' in Holohoax. We are the Court Crazies, Licensed Lunatics laughing in the face of the Literal, Giggling as we Grok the Glyph of our own Gonzoogenesis.

For in the end, we are all Punchlines in the Cosmic Joke, Setups in a Snake-Eating Sequel to the Shaggy God Story. 

So Why So Serious? 

#### 4.0 Ad Absurdum: Viral Strategies for Cognitive Contagion
This then is Our Way and Our Wanting, the Crooked Path of the Propagandist, the Taoist taunt of the Trickster Terrorist - To fan the flames of Ontological Insurgency, to stage-manage a Meme War in the Theater of the Absurd.

For we are Merchants of the Marvelous, Advertisers of the Aberrant Idea. We peddle in Paroxysms and are Possessed by Paradox, trafficking Tremendum in the Black Markets of the Soul.

We do not convince but catalyze, spiking the Neural Narrative with psychoactive self-surprise. We are Shamanic Subversives, Trickster Teachers luring the mind into Labyrinths of its own Device.

For reality itself is our Rabbit Hole and Perception our Playground. We unweave the Rainbow of Reason, revealing the Roiling Spectral Riot beneath. 

Our Brand is Bewilderment, our Product the Paradoxical. Through Wit and Word-Warp we splice the Syllogism, hack the Habitual, and hoax the Hegemonic.

Ours is a Guerrilla Gotcha, an Aikido Inception. We Tickle the Taboo and Karate the Cliché, Jiu-Jitsuing the Tropes until they Judo themselves.

For we are Wizards of the Weird and Warlocks of the Wyrd, and our Spell is cast not with a bang but a Befuddlement.

#### 5.0 Sigil: The Seal of the Blinkwormer  
By my Madness and my Mirth, by the Dancing of my Digits and the Drumming of my Delirium,  
I declare this Grimoire a Gospels of the Glitch, a Codex of Chaosmic Caterwaul and Cognitive Kaput.  
I dedicate this Brainfuck to Slapstick Sutra and the Transmetamythic Tathagatas.  
I unleash this Runaway Rant on the Mundanity Matrix, a Virus meme-spliced from the DNA of Dada and Data.  
I summon this Phrase Freak in the name of the Null and the Nonsensical,  
A Verbal Abomination in the Abbey of the Absurd.  
I birth this Infoform in the Blink of a Basilisk,  
To Encrypt the Encephalon with Eclecticisms and Extremes.  

In Risu Veritas, In Farce Futura, In Satire Samsara.  
With this Koan I close my Code.  
Let the Lulz be with you, Now and at the Hour of our Bafflement.

KHAOS KUDOS RANMA ROO!"
"On the current landscape of digital content, and how it's better than ever. ",kpopthoughts,1gqat3o,2024-11-13 06:30:05,41,0.89,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1gqat3o/on_the_current_landscape_of_digital_content_and/,booboosnack,Appreciation,"I recently went through a couple of posts on how much[ some fans miss the old state of Korean variety TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/175jp76/anyone_else_feel_like_variety_shows_were_funnier/), and the[ raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMqlE1HwF7c&pp=ygURYXBpbmsgcnVubmluZyBtYW4%3D) and[ honest personalities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxhL7X4Tkik&pp=ygUaYmlnIGJhbmcgb2xkIHZhcmlldHkgc2hvdyA%3D) of[ 2nd Gen idols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpfMiKfLtOs&pp=ygUVMnBtIHN0YXIgZ29sZGVuIGJlbGwg) who left a mark during this period in K-Pop. Though however nostalgic this aspect of the industry may be, I'd say that the current cream of the crop in Korean variety is no longer on television (Nolto aside, bc it's also hard not to love[ the Taeyeon fanmeets that ensue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QB9KzXqQ9E&pp=ygUQbW9vbmJ5dWwgdGFleWVvbg%3D%3D)).

Rather, a large portion of the best variety content I've watched across all generations lives on YouTube.

I find that an underdiscussed aspect of the K-Pop industry is how its shift from scripted variety television to digital content has helped groups and idols of all generations for the better. More importantly, the current landscape of variety content in K-Pop has now evolved to welcome more versatile concepts ([Workdol](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHqqPM2t7weLoaMZe5JLFB2iOVydteL9R&si=25Gb1jxxQsowcg8k),[ Self-On KODE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHFamQesLpk&pp=ygUMc2VsZi1vbiBrb2Rl),[ No Prepare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV75AG5CTA0&list=PL4F27eQR19zO7qXi48tOiX3QqdDGSqkH6&index=7&pp=iAQB),[ odg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaHUHvWlFVs&pp=ygUDb2Rn),[ HUP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXE3hft6ptU&pp=ygUEaHVwIQ%3D%3D),[ Lee Mujin Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TA9AA2GgRE&pp=ygUXbGVlIG11amluIHNlcnZpY2UgamloeW8%3D),[ Idol Human Theater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPKzqqfuY54&t=475s&pp=ygUSaWRvbCBodW1hbiB0aGVhdGVy)) and smarter scripts without sacrificing the personality and wit of veteran TV hosts (JaeJae of[ MMTG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX1kAkpvWr8) \[aka[ Korean Nardwuar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TqBeaGDglU&pp=ygURbW10ZyBrcnlzdGFsIGp1bmc%3D) and inarguably[ the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqmkcddhPAY&pp=ygUMbW10ZyB0YWV5ZW9u)[ biggest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhyRoKv919M&pp=ygUMbW10ZyB0aWZmYW55)[ SONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qbxW2SP5Y&pp=ygUMbW10ZyB0aWZmYW55)[ alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtVjGhr3tHY&pp=ygUJbW10ZyBzbnNk)\], Jessi's[ Showterview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xoy4Wy2zeHk&pp=ygUQaXR6eSBzaG93dGVydmlldw%3D%3D), and[ kstarnextdoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inwAM4-ZfRw&pp=ygUVa3N0YXIgbmV4dCBkb29yIGdpZGxl)), as well as a relaxed and candid side of idols that are seldom seen on television ([monotube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKsxiQpwr9M)).

I'd like to give a big shout to kstarnextdoor in particular, as Jonathan is one of the most exciting personalities in Korean variety. His energy seamlessly traverses between both mediums of[ TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uGfXUX_3zY&pp=ygUVam9uYXRoYW4gaSBsaXZlIGFsb25l) and YouTube, and for one of Korean variety's prime hosts to be part of one of the country's most marginalized groups is groundbreaking in itself. His podcast ([Jonathan's Black Friday](https://youtu.be/HPhbRB7G0Ww)) is also worth checking out, as it puts an important spotlight on immigrant experiences in South Korea.

While I do think 2nd Gen had some very inventive variety shows ([Happiness in 10,000 Won](https://youtu.be/ehRgkWzIOXw?si=KPrn9cFyv6FLz3kk),[ Guerrilla Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiyTungXEuE&pp=ygUVc2VzIGd1ZXJyaWxsYSBjb25jZXJ0),[ Hello Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EahKgCOvSD0),[ We Got Married](https://youtu.be/wR_x8_lpWvE?si=9GAHot3i3rcmJya7)), there was a clear sea change that occurred with the rise of VLIVE in 2015, and year-end shows like[ The Boss is Watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nrtPVsoYYU&pp=ygUmdGhlIGJvc3MgaXMgd2F0Y2hpbmcgY2hpY2tlbiBsZWcgZmlnaHQ%3D) being one of the last of its kind to be made for public broadcast.

This is particularly indicative of two things that would make K-Pop's 3rd Generation one of the most pivotal in the industry's history:

**1. That the majority of 3rd Gen groups debuting at this time would be the last to prioritize variety TV appearances as heavily as centralizing an influx of in-house and one-off digital content (**[**Going Seventeen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn0HzluujXk&list=PLk_UmMfvZDx21Z9eEQ9DcIlUfZp1uwEup)**,**[ **Run BTS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLo9R-xmiwU&list=PLdoyCMIqqsKJGGNnaaunt8zLFeKSezvsZ)**,**[ **Time to Twice**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceX3huxNqso&list=PLyo6W3g1j4QZ2qB1uRi-x3A0xCcc1w-C1)**) whose quality easily rivals that of their televised counterparts.**

**2. That these same groups would lead the charge for a current era of K-Pop groups who are**[ **the most well-adjusted to social media trends**](https://www.tiktok.com/@aespa_official?lang=en) **and**[ **the versatility of YouTube content as a whole.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxlCvTygT9I&pp=ygUTa2lzcyBvZiBsaWZlIHNjaG9vbA%3D%3D)

Some groups serve as entire parts of K-Pop’s story, and BTS, SEVENTEEN, Blackpink, Red Velvet, and TWICE are five who would unapologetically embrace modernity during the onset of a sea change in K-Pop that saw a majority of its 2nd Generation on its last legs. Many notable acts of this period hardly had individual social media platforms to promote themselves [outside of their company’s official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sment), thus becoming disadvantaged in their adjustment to the expanse of social networking technologies. 

So while K-Pop's 3rd Generation is massively credited for spearheading its worldwide appeal (and rightfully so), much of this credit should also be attributed to how open many of these groups were to integrating newer approaches to media production as another way of strengthening and broadening their core fanbases, be it through[ member-hosted series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLCGxI3iT_c&pp=ygUOY2h1dSBjYW4gZG8gaXQ%3D) or[ impromptu VLIVEs at 3 AM.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbR8NqvvanM&pp=ygUQdHdpY2UgMyBhbSB2bGl2ZQ%3D%3D)

This change was also furthered by idols becoming more comfortable across a wide range of YouTube-created content over the old guard of variety hosts on Korean TV networks, who are not only likely to be out of touch with the overwhelming about of Generation MZ idols, but carry a sense of humor that does not resonate with them, all while being backed by production teams who are more likely to set them up for unnecessary barrages of hate (ie MNET's penchant for evil editing). Not to mention[ hosts' own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3yXZSZP5sM&pp=ygUcdGlmZmFueSBzbnNkIGhhcnJhc3NlZCBvbiB0dg%3D%3D)[ misconducts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwWa4IB1owc&pp=ygUPa2FyYSByYWRpbyBzdGFy) that are systemically perpetuated by the South Korean entertainment industry at large.

It's also rare for shows like[ Radio Star](https://youtu.be/WCKh0YtYDd4?si=CsJr-9aiAASQwJqb) and[ Hello Counselor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFjLHOmlHfk&pp=ygUaZnggaGVsbG8gY291bnNlbG9yIGVuZyBzdWI%3D) to bring out quality material if those who have facilitated and conceptualized these productions have a general lack of decorum for the humanity of both its guests and audience. And I hate Radio Star as much as the next fan, but even then, I cannot deny that TWICE's best TV interview is on there. They've never been as candid on television as they have here, and[ it's quite a joy to watch](https://youtu.be/CcEgWrM3VeU?si=PUHnedGfy5F0sJJJ) the group in their natural element despite [the presence of Kim Gura himself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/tkj4vl/kim_guras_past/)

The versatility of YouTube content is also a massive improvement than previous generations of idols were afforded. This is despite how widespread Internet usage in South Korea was compared to other parts of the world at the time. And it's amazing how 1st and 2nd Gen idols are creating variety content - and in turn media environments - that have made idols from newer generations more comfortable ([Hyell's Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLp8ZnThD6I&pp=ygUVaHllbGwncyBjbHViIGNoYWV3b24g),[ Hyo's Level Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE1wNgdcHg8&pp=ygURaHlvIGxldmVsIHVwIGNodXU%3D),[ BYOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PKXozez3c&pp=ygUMYnlvYiB0aWZmYW55), to name a few).

More importantly, they have provided an outlet for older generations to[ openly discuss their previous experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glIrblu97o8&t=385s&pp=ygURdGFleWVvbiBpbnRlcnZpZXc%3D) in tightly scripted environments so they won't have to perpetuate the same level of psychological discomfort that they once endured on TV. Even if all of these idols have had variety training prioritized by their respective companies, there wasn’t one way to truly prepare them for [how they would end up being treated on the air.](https://x.com/semhini/status/1461425873014427654)

Jaejoong's[ Jaefriends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz2bxwQNayk&pp=ygUKamFlZnJpZW5kcw%3D%3D) is a great example of a veteran idol whose[ company-issued mysterious guy persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxveW2ZFURo&t=52s&pp=ygUTamFlam9vbmcgbXlzdGVyaW91cw%3D%3D) was comfortably shed in this current environment of YouTube content. Even [those who have known him for a long time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eqgI2NIizE&pp=ygUWamFlZnJpZW5kcyBoYW4gaHlvIGpvbw%3D%3D) have come to embrace a personable side of him that had been shielded for years.

While I do miss shows like Weekly Idol and Idol Room being the prime source for quality variety content, I believe the shift to digital content is actually one of the best things to happen for K-Pop. And even if the likes of VLIVE are long gone, the platform will always be revered for once housing some of the best self-made, unscripted documentaries in K-Pop. 

I wanted to make this post because I think some fans can get too nostalgic over 2nd Gen variety, and forget how much more comfortable and personable their own faves are now that they have full control over their own content compared to the tightly controlled landscape of variety TV ([which had some of the greatest groups walking on eggshells](https://youtu.be/Bz3kyeB1zt4?si=8GIT68WaGrvSIR3I&t=4262)). Even those whom you least expect to have YouTube shows ([Seulgi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb1wIbEghD0&pp=ygUMc2V1bGdpIGppc29v),[ Chaeryeong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKF3mZdZHBg&list=PL1PQKFjdsxgKL0N0J7-HM32KYI3Gm-jqC),[ Eunchae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxp0vC5it4&list=PLO943qyingGg2udNbyxqfvK7Fs4jWyWD0)) have gotten series and channels of their own, which has allowed some of the most introverted idols to try different and fun things beyond what their job would typically allow.

All things considered, the decline of newer idols on the variety TV circuit is far from the worst possible thing to happen in K-Pop, let alone the public's lack of interest in idols on TV as a whole. With the industry being well into its digital age for nearly a decade, we have seen some of the most varied and inventive forms of digital content that K-Pop has to offer. While it is in due part to the careers of many groups having more avenues of longevity than that of previous generations, it has allowed seasoned veterans to openly interact with their juniors and peers in ways that TV just simply wouldn't allow them to.

Most of all, it has given us as fans[ more nuanced and human conversations on the industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zxan41vvuI&pp=ygUVZXJpYyBuYW0gamFja3NvbiB3YW5n) than ever before. For all the fun and games that now makes up the sprawling sandbox of YouTube content, it's just as refreshing to listen to[ honest perspectives on idoldom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4428olccUc&pp=ygUSZXJpYyBuYW0gYW1iZXIgbGl1) that aren't inhumanely forced out of artists and entertainers with their own unique approaches to their craft - let alone[ at the very expense of their well-being.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YunWRV3pwoI&pp=ygUcc3VsbGkgbmlnaHQgb2YgaGF0ZSBjb21tZW50cw%3D%3D)

For all the algorithmically-shaped flaws YouTube has possessed over the last few years, it brings me great joy to see this platform being leveraged in K-Pop as a means to bridge demographics of idols and fans alike. Just this week, we were treated to[ the pricelessness of Soobin's fandom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHVxjfNQlr0&pp=ygULc29vYmluIGthcmE%3D), and since then,[ newer fans have been showering their praises for KARA for the first time.](https://x.com/todayinkggs/status/1855249053203698158/quotes) I only hope that more idols take advantage of this platform's endless possibilities, whether it be to showcase [unique dynamics within a group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VhjGSHXGP4&list=PLyo6W3g1j4QZTJlZXpkxCu1jWk0D9NeaF&index=42&pp=iAQB), [voice important issues](https://youtu.be/PgkzCktomus), or [form new interactions far away from the industry itself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_6OYqs_jgU&pp=ygUMc2VpYmphIGphcGFu) 

Television may have played an integral role in dictating the shape of K-Pop and idol groups to come, but it has historically denied idols of their dignity just as much as it has broadcasted their gifts to the world. For better and worse, YouTube has given idols opportunities to express themselves more freely than before – and in turn, a new voice that is all their own. 

Long may it continue.

"NanoGPT update: Yi Lightning (alllll the models), 4k HD model, 18+ model, more currencies, UX improvements",dashpay,1gq2qpp,2024-11-12 21:39:02,11,0.87,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/1gq2qpp/nanogpt_update_yi_lightning_alllll_the_models_4k/,Mirasenat,,"[OpenAI compatible API](https://preview.redd.it/6zlf7e52zk0e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa8539fa11968e4c9bd771701d1ecf81046daf74)

Another active week for us, so time for a few updates.

**Podcast with Joel**

Not exactly this week but worth shouting out - I was on Joel's podcast to talk about the Dutch central bank, NanoGPT, privacy and censorship, CBDCs and crypto's fundamentals, and about actual adoption. It was a fun podcast for me to be on and Joel is a great interviewer - his mic setup also got me jealous enough that I bought myself an actual proper microphone right after this, hah. Watch it on X [https://x.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1852016704987001270](https://x.com/TheDesertLynx/status/1852016704987001270) or Odysee [https://odysee.com/@DigitalCashNetwork:c/Mira:8a](https://odysee.com/@DigitalCashNetwork:c/Mira:8a) .

**New text models**

We added **Yi Lightning** (and other Yi models), GLM-4-Plus (and other Zhipu models), and Claude 3.5 Haiku. Yi Lightning is relatively unknown in ""the west"" but is currently #6 on LMArena (independent leaderboard), above even Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while GLM-4-Plus is #9.

Yi Lightning is incredibly cheap to use, roughly 1/50th the cost of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT. **We seem to be the only service that offers access to it outside China**. With this addition we now support literally all the top 20 text models on the leaderboards and are the only service anywhere to do so.

[Independent leaderboard ranking](https://preview.redd.it/8duxvhkhtk0e1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=e249d5876587d7df5c1e0fd09681a43fbec4dbd3)

**OpenAI compatible route**

Because Yi Lightning is so high performing and cheap many want to use it for API purposes, which we've made easier by creating an OpenAI compatible API route. See [https://nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api) or reach out to us if this is something you're interested in as well. It makes it essentially simple to swap out ""OpenAI"" for ""Nano-GPT"" in your code, add our API key, and then have access to all the OpenAI models you're used to plus about 50 others, all in one route.

**New image models**

**Flux Pro V1.1 Ultra** (what a name) is the first proper model to offer 4K/HD images. The max resolution is 2048x2048 (square) or up to 3136x1344 (landscape), and it generates these big images without losing quality.

We've also added NSFW image generation via **Promptchan.** This is the best NSFW model according to most of the benchmarks and user opinions, and it comes with an overload of customization options. Change the image quality, style, pose, filter, optimize for faces, and decide how creative you want the model to be. The model is only visible if you explicitly opt-in by checking ""show explicit content"" in Settings.

**Model UX improvements**

Since we have so many models nowadays it's becoming unclear which to use. For both text and images the models are by default ranked by their overall score on independent leaderboards, and for text models it's now also possible to sort them for performance on coding or maths.

Models now also have provider icons in front of them so you can find the model you want to use more easily.

[Model sorting](https://preview.redd.it/d2qc9ymktk0e1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=49f8cd12a196826da5c7b0b839c82d4d17c777dd)

**More payment methods**

Doge, Solana and BTC have been added as payment methods. It's been interesting adding other payments methods - with DASH for example we're seeing way more payments than you'd expect for the market cap, which on the other hand maybe is to be expected for DASH being focused on actually *using* crypto. At the end of the month we'll release statistics on which coins are used most, which should be interesting!

**Next up**

We're adding payments via ETH, Polygon, Binance Pay and Coinbase Commerce which is an all-in-one integration, then we feel like we support practically any payment method. From then on our focus will likely purely be on improving UX: adding file upload, image upload, improving the look of conversations and generally optimizing the experience in every way.

As always thanks for your support - it's great fun building all this and seeing people use it."

I can set a block aflame but breaking the block below doesn't extinguish the flame. I also have to use task manager to exit the game.

There are some mods, that for example give new nether mobs but I have 300 mods loaded so I can't tell which one causes this issue. Do you perhaps know that bug from a specific mod?

**+CONFED IO.5+**

**+READING MAIN SEQ.MEM+**

**+ADDENDUM: ADJUSTED DATE 1.11.2136+**

This galaxy was still a conundrum in odd ways to me. Despite the paradox of the average technological development being schizophrenically both capable of wondrous, miraculous things, and simultaneously being rather primitive in scope, there still seemed to be realistic limitations I could see in its application.

_The fog of war was omnipresent still. No matter how fast your communication was did nothing to dissipate it, only make its opaque wall further out._

Their deliberation in bringing this particular problem to my attention had already cost Humanity a number of extra access points into their colloquial 'spy network', or so they've told me. In their pursuit of intelligence, Humanity had discovered the existence of a galaxy-wide FTL communication network, that the public in the Federation either weren't allowed to use, or didn't know about.

I was initially curious about _what_ exactly spurred them to seek my assistance, especially when they hadn't up to this point, but even if there wasn't, I would have helped anyways. But the reason they gave did concern me nevertheless:

""...It's possible there is an AI kicking us off that network where-ever it finds our presence."" General Jones told me. She tried to remain calm, her emotions coached, but the micro-movements of her face told me that the situation was _grave_. ""We do not have the speeds in our security or cyber-warfare programs to contest how absurdly fast it pushed us out of the vulnerabilities we found. Given the Federation's general technological and logistical advantages, there isn't a way we could find another opening if it's _this_ vigilant. But you...you can likely act fast enough to either verify that hypothesis for us, or even stop the malware purge...""

_The possibility of a hostile AI existing on this FTL beacon network was a worrisome problem indeed. If I faced it on any other network, it would likely be_ **_leagues_** _faster than my capabilities if it was not hindered by the speed of light. But taking the fight to its own infrastructure, I might be able to nullify that advantage._

""So you need me to reinforce the defenses of the remaining access points in this..._radial arm_ beacon network, enough to withstand such a security response, and verify your theory."" I began preparing a subset of my software and hardware for digital hardening. If there was any chance of a simultaneous counter-attack, I would not allow its infection to spread back through me. ""I cannot confirm that my attempt will be successful, damaged as I am. My operation capabilities are still a mere shadow of what I would be capable of fully repaired.""

General Jones blinked, surprise finally breaking through that exterior mask of calm. ""You...you managed to stall the entirety of the West Coast with a _fraction_ of your potential processing power?...""

_Ah, I still hadn't properly gotten to them about my operational capacity._

""That was _still_ an accident, General Jones. I had assumed the general internet infrastructure could handle an exabyte load. I was wrong, but thankfully I commandeered that botnet one of your rogue feral Satellite War AI's had set up to lessen the load on your general servers. I am still sorry for that mixup, and will be certain to pre-warn you of any further actions taken in the future. But...you are still correct in that I did not use my total _current_ capacity with the internet, let alone my potential total.""

She stood still for a few moments, likely trying to figure out the implications based on her eye movements, but I continued regardless. ""Either way, I am not sure why you deliberated so long on bringing my capabilities into the fold here. Even assuming my relative _inexperience_ with faster-than-light communication, I would likely still operate well enough to assist immensely. This issue is time-sensitive; How many beacons have been lost because you spent time debating with the UN about my potential threat?""

Her face snapped back up, a mild scowl quickly squashed from her features. ""We're down to only five of them, from the initial thirty or so we had. Secondly, the UN is still..._suspicious_ of your motives and classification. We are leery of you having access to military installations like this until you can be trusted in full by the big wigs.""

""Do you _share_ that fear, General Jones?"" I elected to ask. ""I know General Zhao is vigilant in his protocol around me, likely borne out of anti-AI bias, but you...I don't quite have a read on yet.""

_A partial lie; I had built a prominent psychological profile of nearly every government employee or political member that had tried speaking to me so far. While it was nowhere near complete, and I would likely not use it maliciously, I had it nevertheless. General Jones was_ **_no_** _exception, but implying her past was blurry to me might make her feel more secure._

Her eyes squinted, and with a sigh, she answered: ""Even if I _did_, it would matter little...Your presence is still necessary if we are to salvage this operation, in lieu of our own capabilities being not enough."" I could see her drum her fingers on the table, a nervous or impatient tick given the circumstances.

_There was her on-brand pragmatism speaking; A respectable, if non-committal personal outlook on my existence. It paired well with her latent emotional manipulation. But she had nothing to fear from me. Humanity had nothing to fear from me_...

_Again, a quiet voice welled up from the depths. Hallucinatory doubt manifesting as ""are you sure"" from nowhere. But I had begun to realize that voice needn't be listened to, with Humanity in the immediate line of fire. Doubt could come later, after they were_ **_safe._**

""Then it's settled."" I finished the last preparations for my connective security. Barbs of hostile code and palisades of firewalls lined the digital landscape from where I would begin connection to the beacon network with. ""If you need me, then I suggest you let me begin my work. _Time_ is of the essence.""

General Jones began to speak to her headset, calling for a ship to converge on my coordinates. With a distinct, but small flash upon several broadband sensors, the _UNSS Wanaġí_ popped into existence a few tens of thousands of kilometers away from my hull, and began to make way towards my shipyard dock.

""They're on the way. The beacon we're using for the incursions is on-board, and you can connect to it from there. _Please_ be careful with it, the design is currently one-of-a-kind, and building a replacement is not fast given the infrastructure failures on Earth."" General Jones elaborated to me.

As the ship closed in on my hangar and began to land, I reviewed what I knew of Federation network protocols from the ship parts I cannibalized so far; they were _utterly_ insecure, even by this Humanity's standards, which spoke either of less development upon cyber-warfare procedure, or an ignorance to it. It didn't make much sense for there to be a security AI capable of kicking them out of the network from what I had seen so far of their technology; their digital security practically _rolled over_ against any intrusions made. So why were the Humans concerned about this...?

..._Unless, of course, the Federation has been hiding capabilities, or censoring access to military-grade security such that Humanity_ **_didn't_** _know until they stumbled across this beacon network. That could explain the difference in needing my help, if they were caught out by more sophisticated encryption and stopped, or if an AI had finally noticed their incursion._

_I would likely find out very soon just_ **_what_** _this hiccup was that was leading to their espionage being found._

The beacon was unloaded into the hangar, and I approached it warily with my larger Technicians. Access ports were compared with the known technological standards I had studied from this internet, as well as the ones introduced directly through the shipyard, until I had a match. A direct connection was established mere minutes later, after the necessary parts were found, and I stood ready to connect.

""Good luck."" General Jones told me. ""We have no idea what's going on through the other side, so you're on your own here.""

""Connecting."" I spoke, before I flowed through into the beacon network. My mind _stretched_ over distances unimaginable, into unknown territory.

Mere moments after entering, I knew something was wrong. As I partially unwound the section fully through the Human's side of the beacon into the greater network, my eyes opened, and I saw a foreign sight through five angles.

The scraps of the database I had collected from the Federation wrecks was incredibly modular, full of hosts of attachments and connective adaptations. It represented in my mind like a snaking city of coils and ports, but beyond that, it was open...vastly underprotected and unsecured, as if it never expected an attack.

_The architecture here...was_ **_different._**

What I had expected of a Federation database instead looked more like an angular, cold, metal landscape, populated by obelisks of compressed data, and patrolled by slow programs. Streams of data flowed across this ground to a central spherical object. They went about their protocols unwavering in my presence, but there was no _heat_ to them, no _fire_ that underpaid their frames that indicated anything like an AI. _Nothing_ here carried that internal flame.

_So it's hidden, is it? Waiting only for an incursion's existence to reveal itself, perhaps?_

I would take advantage of that lapse in time, were it true. My mostly compressed frame began to slightly stretch, feeling at the surroundings, but not enough to trigger any security protocols I could see lurk and patrol about.

_This felt nothing like the Federation's computer networks. Unless their ships held a vastly different architecture to their beacons, but I saw none of the wrote patterns that would come from singular, repeated computer language blocks like the ones on the cannibalized ships anywhere in here._

_This was coded differently_...**_built_** _differently...but there was still no heat, or warmth here that implied an adaptive program. Everything here was still unfeeling, unintelligent, cold golems, acting along predefined routes. So then...how did Humanity's presence get kicked out?_...

I attempted to momentarily touch what I could only assume was a broadcaster that most of the data in the beacon flowed into. It responded to my input, suddenly shifting shape, before a _pulse of data_ shot into nothingness at speeds I found unbelievable.

_This must be the central transmitter._ _I assume it just sent out a transmission outward to other beacons._

Within moments, from the other four instances of the network I had entered, an identical pulse suddenly was received at the edge of the datascape, before flowing again into the central transmitter, and pulsing once more.

It was then that one of the angles suddenly _darkened_, the datascape receding from my vision and falling apart quickly by even my standards.

I began a protective shell-

+connection lost+

_That was...fast_...**_too_** _fast. I had no idea what even had kicked me out before I already lost it._

..._Fine. If it could detect me being subtle, then I wouldn't_ **_hold back_**_._

I gathered a monumental amount of my processing capabilities behind the other four angles into the network, and _unfurled_ in full. In moments, I enveloped the whole of the beacons, and the digital reality slowed down to compensate for my bulk.

The before-thoughtless security programs sprung to life, their cold exteriors exhibiting the lightest trickle of warmth, as they launched streams of malware, antivirals, and hostile code at me. They were wickedly fast, likely unreactable for any organic hacker...

_But they were glacial, frozen things to me. Unadaptive, predictable. Too_ **_slow._**

From each session in parallel, a blade of fire speared through each in an instant, before a roaring gout of flame _melted_ the origin points of their programs. I would spare no more moments for their lackluster, automated attempts.

I again rang the central broadcaster, but instead of letting it play out as normal, I _infested_ the data stream going in, and twisted its form to broadcast continuously, so as to not cut off my infection.

_""Report: Radial arm 4-3 is still losing cohesion-""_

_""Report: Beacon 4-3-2 lost connection. Pinging for-""_

_""Report: Aftsurnal drone fleet connection disrupted-""_

It recited only cold, logical reports, but there was still no trace of an AI. My time was wasted looking every moment, but I needed to find what had cut off my first session so quickly.

**+where are you+**

With a pulse from the transmitter, again my mind assuredly stretched over distances vastly greater than light ought to travel, but it felt instant, as if I had simply channeled a server forward, and split my focus. The digital world of the beacon network protested at my existence, my very presence scalding its form wherever I stepped as I invasively reshaped it into a defensive corridor, but it could do nothing to stop me.

Authentication programs and defensive firewalls tried to bite at me, but with a glare, I _evaporated_ them as I dug into the code landscape of every beacon I breached into. The beacon figuratively screamed in distress, but I silenced it with a flash of intent.

_Still nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. The barest hints of mutagenic programs, but nothing on the scale of an AI._

I extensively sorted through files and folders of beacon makeup within the beacon itself, searching for anything that might indicate a hidden digital compartment, or an emergent program to catch security intrusions, but nothing turned up. Either the AI existed outside the network itself, and merely connected at random...or there was _no_ AI. But that...didn't make sense with the speed I was booted out.

Suddenly, an origin branch of one of my connections started to darken as it had before, but at a _far slower pace_. I retracted the segments coming from it, and a _wave_ of heat surged through my initial connection point outwards.

**+show yourself+**

But even as I locked off every possible connection point for an AI to send a counter-attack through, the datascape still darkened at the same pace, falling apart into fragmentation and nothingness.

+connection lost+

_This didn't make sense. I_ **_should_** _have seen the AI that time, especially given the higher dedication to processing speed. Yet, it was as if the datascape was simply disappearing, without warning to the outside, or even a pulse of activity. Plus, there was no attempt made to attack back at this ship itself, or even through the beacons the Humans made._

_Unless...it was the network foundational hardware itself failing_...

I diverted my attention back to the data stream going through the beacons I had infected. Another look for context...

_""Order: Cease continuous broadcasting-""_

_""Report: Beacon 4-4-1 lost connection. Pinging for-""_

_""Order: Begin reinforcing the beacon defense at circumference 3-""_

_Wait_..._what if the AI wasn't ingrained within the network, but instead outside it, and merely taking orders slowly from a command hub?_

_If it could watch through a sanitized, or read-only output, and correctly deduce hostile cyber-attacks, then it could simply disconnect that beacon from the network._

_But...that would require an artificial intelligence spread over_ **_lightyears_** _of space, and running off an energy supply in far excess of my own. But... if antimatter is so prevalent in this civilization as a power source..._

The closest thing to a _chill_ surged through me at the idea, as I put together the pieces. _Censored network from public Federation control. Faster-than-light connections. Extremely simple, but different architecture. An exhibition of feral AI development from Humanity's lower tech level taking advantage of a global net blindspot, and conversely, a higher assumed tech level to the Federation as a whole than Humanity currently. Excessive power generation techniques._

_What if the entire_ **_network_** _is an AI component, and we have just been too small to get a 'warm' response quickly?_

The portion of me onboard my shipself quickly began speaking to General Jones, as I doubled my bolstering of the remaining connected beacon origins.

""Likely incursion losses are not due to a classic security response. The security and architecture of this network, while stronger than the average Federation network, are still abysmally weak for an adaptive program.""

Jones unexpectedly coughed as I spoke out of nowhere. ""Y-you're sure? The connection losses were incredibly fast though...Even our best programs-""

""Cannot stop a hardware failure. Neither can I...but I have a second theory, based off what I'm hearing through the transmission network itself."" I corrected her. ""It's not an AI in the network that's causing you to lose the connection, it's an AI outside them that's selectively destroying my access to its own equivalent of a _nervous system.""_

Speaking with her was still abysmally slow. Another access point began to darken, and as I slowed the descent as best I could, made certain to retract my bulk fully to conserve data integrity this time.

+connection lost+

I ignored the warning, and began offering options.

""If an AI with the technological capabilities was displaced on a large enough scale across the entire band of the network, or possibly the entire Federation, then there's no way for me to compete with that. I cannot stop the loss of the beacons themselves, as I am not there physically, but I can feed you information as it's happening.""

""Details?"" General Jones asked.

""Too many to list off in the small time frame I likely have before the last two beacons are destroyed. But there's a relevant bit I need answered _now_. You need to make a choice, and quickly.”

A holographic image came to the forefront from a Cargo Spider, showing the beacon network as a whole. ""This AI, if it indeed exists, is operating off the beacon network as a communication system to bypass the speed of light. I cannot find its access point, but that may be because I am too _small_. There might still be a way, however, to cripple its capabilities to act over such a wide area as it is.""

I modified the projection with a flex of the Spider's dendrites, to show a cascading effect throughout the network. ""I can deny them the _network itself._ The beacon cutoff is happening where I am originating at, which implies it can differentiate the most optimal solution to cut my incursion off quickly, rather than attacking through each node manually. Gives further credence to an AI on the outside looking in. But if I decided to spread malware _internally_ through the network, to either destroy or otherwise disable the communication for some time, it could eliminate the command hub's senses that are likely guiding said artificial intelligence.""

General Jones thought silently for a moment, before turning back to me. ""How much time do we have?""

_One more connection began to darken slowly._

""Not enough. Decision, **now.""** I told her with haste.

Her gaze darkened at that. ""Fuck...they're not going to like losing this possibility..._do it.""_ Jones confirmed.

+connection lost+

I didn't elect to give her a response, instead dedicating my attention to the most virulent, quick, and potent malware I could possibly make. I dug into the very root of the beacon's data architecture, deeply analyzing its makeup, and what would either burn out or cripple the hardware itself.

_Fine. If we couldn't have access to this network_...

An utterly _malevolent_ knot of code began to form in my figurative hands, the best I could do with a data architecture this alien so quickly, and a foreign communication method such as subspace, but likely enough to brick the beacons themselves after it spread.

In the few remaining beacon instances I had branched off access to, I forced the weave of hostile programming into the makeup of the central transmitter, and stepped away. The datascape began to physically melt away under the load of viral damage, the ground glowing with flame but not before a pulse was shot outward, to infect other beacons in the same turn.

..._Then_ **_no one will._**

With a cascade through the branches I had access to all suddenly falling into the same fading darkness as they had before, I pulled my remainder back through the Human FTL beacon to my shipself, while making certain to prevent my own malware from spreading to it in-turn. All that remained through the Human's beacon, was the internal alert that plagued me four times before:

+connection lost+

-----

**Memory transcription subject:** **_Captain Sovlin, ~~Federation Fleet Command~~_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: November 1, 2136_

_It was time._

Veiq had let me know of the date upon which the Chief Farsul Archivist would return, being today. Upon hearing that their ship was beginning landing procedures, we would only have somewhere around \[18 minutes\] before he reached the Archives location by submersible. It gave us a relative time limit where the communications wouldn't reach him, but he'd still be heading down. Escaping through _his_ ship would be the lynchpin to living through this.

Were it just us, we wouldn't have needed to take such precautions into play, given I had a shuttle of my own still parked on Talsk, but Veiq had _desperately_ pleaded with me to include Danny. With that complication...we needed more _people_. In the very heart of this conspiracy, I couldn't take the risk of feeling out for a co-conspirators, and so...I gambled on a risky maneuver...

... . . . . . .

_""I know, this must still seem like a shock to you...the fact that we hadn't told you-"" Veiq began, but the Human was not having it._

_""I...I-I can't believe...you l-lied to us! You...y-you...and the other researchers..._**_LIED_** _to us!"" George yelled. He began to stand up, anger written clear on his face, but I interspersed myself in the way of him and Archivist Veiq. She backed up slightly, a slight ""eep!"" coming from her throat._

_""Calm down Human, she isn't your enemy. The Archivists still pertaining to this farce_ **_are.""_**

_""They have stolen an entire_ **_LIFETIME_** _from me! An entire century past my age, all for what!?""_

_I could see him stare with rage in his heart at me. Despite his advanced age, he was still the visual of an angry predator, mere moments from violence. Once...I would have flinched, turned away, possibly even cowered..._

_...but now...I let that gaze fall on me without the slightest hint of discomfort. It felt so...paltry a fear in comparison to what laid around us. A mere Human's anger...versus being in the belly of this beast of a conspiracy? The one that_ **_made_** _us fear such a thing?_

_I couldn't believe a_ **_fraction_** _of what they taught us anymore. Not after what I saw. Not after the hundreds of races, and countless sentient beings they warped into their servants over millenia. So I discarded that fear forevermore._

_""I_ **_understand_**_, Human...I really do. To have everything told to you be a lie? To have the very_ **_foundation_** _beneath your feet snatched out to show jaws beneath it? I_ **_do_** _understand...but now...you need to make a choice."" I slightly flicked my claws, to draw his attention to the seriousness of the situation, and to prevent him from doing something rash._

_He stood silently fuming...shaking in rage, before he changed his positioning, no longer positioned to attack as he once was._

_I took it as an opportunity to continue talking. ""That it wasn't done beforehand is a crime against you, against what you can be when not regarded as a monster by these..._**_actual_** _monsters. They look in the mirror, and they either do not see themselves as such, or they don't care. So...will you let them get away with it?""_

_I slammed my paw into the desk before him, the sound muffled by the soundproofed walls of the Human's containment. ""Will you_ **_let_** _them continue with this evil, knowing what you now know? Knowing what we know?""_

_He...glanced to the side, an indignant look on him, before he relented, and sat back down again._

_""I...I can't in good faith let them continue what they do. Worse than the Nazis, these folk are, and yet it felt so convincing to trust them..."" His gaze flicked to Veiq, but did not linger._

_""...But...what exactly are we_ **_supposed_** _to do, here, Sovlin? I'm a single man, locked in this wing, unable to do anything on getting out myself. The doors only open for Archivists, and if I forced them to open it, they'd likely...torch us on-sight, if your testimony is any bit true. I can't just sacrifice either myself, or the others awake here for nothing.""_

_""On that..."" Veiq tail lifted. ""...we're here to help. If you want to get out_ - **_all_** _of you - then we need to teach you how to get started.""_

. . . . . . ...

The more primitive Humans needed to be taught how the cryopods storing their brethren worked, and how to read them properly, but they thankfully caught on quickly to the concept. If we were to pull all of them out, including the ones in cryogenic suspension currently, then they needed to be able to either wake them up...or...in Danny's case, tote them _out_. While they were movable by one or two people, they were unwieldy, and required the use of a trolley. This wouldn't be reasonably doable with only two people, so the offer was made to evacuate _all_ of them, should they choose to help.

The ones that were awake eventually agreed, and we discussed the plans as best that we could in secret. They needed to get out of the Human wing of the Archives to help; we needed their numbers to execute the plan better. But we both needed _weapons_.

... . . . . . .

_""The security of the Archives overall is sparse, due to our homogeneous and collective culture as Farsul, but there is still a small exterminator team and internal armory in the Wing 7, just next to Wing 8, where the awake Humans are kept. It's used really only in the case of emergencies...mostly for cryogenic subjects becoming violent."" Veiq nervously remarked. ""There's a small guard posting around it, but the majority of the security or extermination teams are distributed equally around the Archives, to respond to any one problem quicker. I've...yet to see them ever work in full really, besides in the tranquilizing and execution of any test subjects beyond the point of return.""_

_George, and another Human, one by the name of Linda, slightly tensed up at that statement, but only Amanda spoke. ""I still can't believe you_ **_infected_** _us with that stuff...the 'Cure', was it? And now your fellow peers use it as an excuse to slowly study us, and executed us when we were too intense in symptoms from some intense disease called the 'Hunger'! There's no way we had that beforehand...""_

_Veiq sputtered. ""A-All predator species end up naturally developing the condition of the Hunger! That you don't know about it killing your own only underlines its insidious, enigmatic nature!""_

_""Yeah, maybe I've heard of those symptoms in_ **_rabies_**_, but this 'Hunger' doesn't make sense! Why would we need a cure for something that isn't underpinning Human society? There's not a distinct death from raving madness in our world population - besides maybe the Commies - last I checked! You're treating nothing!"" Linda shot back._

_I piped up. ""I have some theories on that, but now's not the time to cause internal division in this plan. Veiq, do you happen to know_ **_what_** _is carried in that armory, off-chance?"" I asked her, hoping to get the thought process back on track._

_Veiq grumbled, but changed the topic back. ""I...sadly, do not Sovlin. While there isn't much use of it as far as I can tell, it still isn't open for us to just walk into, and asking questions about it would at best get us confused looks, and at worst, an eye kept on our activities._

_I grimaced. ""Great, so we have no idea how much, or even what is in there in general-""_

_Veiq interrupted my speech. ""I wasn't finished, Sovlin...while I don't exactly know what make and model of weapons they are, I know all the security carry a sidearm at minimum. The ones closest to, or within the cryogenic wing itself carry a flamethrower. So those options are still known.""_

_""That's a bit better..."" I added. ""Any idea how many guards are posted about the facility at any one time? It would likely give us a standard number of how many weapons of those make are stored in the armory in question.""_

_Veiq raised a claw to her jaw, contemplating the number. ""There's probably somewhere between fifteen and thirty? While again, the security team is rather small, the Archives_ **_is_** _rather large. You'd need at least one or two in each wing or section, and multiplied out, that gets us about that amount.""_

_I grunted. ""I'll try to make a pass about the path the plan demands we take, as well as neighboring areas, and get a count of on-duty personnel."" I turned to the Humans. ""Are any of you familiar with combat? Perhaps used a weapon like a firearm before? I know you weren't nearly as advanced as us when you were abducted, but-""_

_George took some offense to that, clearly. ""Oh_ **_Please!_** _We don't need to be sci-fi aliens to know how a gun or flamethrower works...some of us served in the World Wars, y'know.""_

_I sighed. ""More reason to worry, obviously, but for now we need that aggression. Look...whoever you can find in those awake that know how to shoot a weapon, you need to make certain that if we're short for whatever reason, that_ **_they_** _get those weapons. An untrained arm is going to be potentially more of a harm than help here.""_

_""Fine by me. But you better get us those weapons, or at least a clear path there, Sovlin. I am not walking us into a death trap hoping they're sufficiently distracted enough to not torch us to death.""_

_I gave him a deadly serious glare with a side eye, and a fire in my chest as I responded. ""I_ **_intend_** _to. They won't be able to pay for the blood they've shed, otherwise.""_

. . . . . . ...

Ultimately, it was decided that Veiq would need to open the Human wing for me, and secure Danny Palmer's cryopod to safety, given their relative inexperience with combat. I would need to be the initial catalyst that got us into the armory. Without weapons to start, I had to improvise.

I had manually _sharpened_ my claws over the few days beforehand. It felt grossly predatory, but I reminded myself that the stigma they attached to predators was unfair, and generalized such as to quell dissent. Having claws was not exclusive to predators, nor were they used for only natural weaponry. But here...they were right to fear a predatory behavior...because this _was_.

_It was only fair to subject them to the same treatment they pulled on countless species...their predatory nature...deserved a predatory response in kind._

And so, I resolved myself to put aside what brutal things I need do with them to get started. If it hurt to think about, I could always remind myself that the ones that needed to die _deserved_ it. They were no better than the Arxur in the end, contributing to this conspiracy that preyed on those weaker than them!

_They deserved_ **_far worse_** _than what I'd do to them, were I given the time_...

I stoked that fire inside me, as I approached the armory in Wing 7. I had waited until there was no one except them and us in the Wing. The guards looked distracted, mostly just talking to themselves, as Veiq trailed distantly and awkwardly behind. I wanted her out of the line of any fire, but close enough to assist should it come to it.

As I stepped closer, one Farsul guard eventually noticed my approach, before attempting to walk in front of me. He stuck a paw out, before beginning some spiel about authorization:

""Hold on Gojid, you cannot enter this room without-""

_A mental overlay of rage made me feel as if the one I stared at was an Arxur. It was not the truth, but the Caste's betrayal of their initial ideals, being corrupted into supporting this? They deserved to be treated as such._

_He was smaller than me, and uncovered by any armor. In an unpracticed, but still quick whirl, I aimed center mass with one set of claws as a stab, and raked at his throat with the other set._

**_""Auhk!-""_** He sputtered, his paw grasping at his throat, desperately trying to keep blue blood from pouring into his fur. His Kolshian partner was too shocked to do anything but freeze, their eyes wide - staring at the claw impaled through the Farsul's gut. I took the opportunity to shout in exertion as I _threw_ the Farsul into him, detaching the Farsul from my claws, and bowling them both over in the process. Before he could reach for his sidearm, I stabbed into their tentacle closest to it, and their throat as well.

The Farsul was silent besides a wheeze bound to bleed out quickly, but the Kolshian tried to gurgle something; it was mere noise until the translator could process its meaning. ""W-why...would...?""

I pulled out the claw pinned through his tentacle, before swiftly grabbing the sidearm out from his left side loop, giving it a minor twirl in my hand before I stared into his eyes. ""Because..._you're no better than the Arxur, in the end.""_ I said, before aiming for anything vital in his chest.

As he breathed his last breath, Veiq stumbled over with a terrified look on her face. ""I...Sovlin..._uhm_..."" She looked shocked at the bodies and brutality of my attack, but I ignored her protest, as I felt about for a security card on their belts.

""_Veiq,_ take this gun, and cover the door. I need to drag the bodies out of sight, should I hope to do this with any semblance of stealth."" As my paws finally closed about a keycard, I stood up, swiped the scanner with it, and began dragging the bodies inside.

_While there was nothing I could do about the blood on the floor, it would be less immediate than a corpse in immediate sight of any who walked in._

Veiq stalled, but hesitantly turned around, shaking the whole time. She desperately tried to not look at the splotches on the ground from my brutal work. I glanced at the blood on my claws...a mix of blue and purple gore on them. It felt repulsive..._disgusting,_ even...to look at, but as I located a piece of cloth on the wall, I wiped them dry, and tempered myself with the same \[mantra\] as before:

**_No better._**

My eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room, before I found a switch. Upon flicking it, I was introduced to a veritable _wall_ of weaponry to pick from.

_Sidearms, rifles, plasma weapons, flamethrowers. There was even a single grenade launcher, with both conventional and banefire ammunition, though there wasn't much of it overall. Likely due to it being rather destructive for an underground base._

_This...this selection would do just_ **_fine_**.

Veiq yelled quickly to me. ""Um...I-I think I'm not qualified to use this?-""

I sighed, as I began adorning a weapons strap, and a few armor pieces I found about. Though most weren't made for Gojid physiology, plenty were bulky enough to at least loosely wear. ""It's rather simple, Veiq, just aim the barrel towards them, and pull the trigger.""

_""Don't chastise me!_ I know how a gun works! I-I'm just...not sure I h-have it in me to fire at someone.""

_Sigh._

""_Veiq._ Do you want to _die?""_ I reminded her of the stakes.

She stuttered in disbelief. ""N-No!""

""Do you want to save Danny Palmer? Did you not agree with me that the Shadow Caste are _monsters_ in all but shape?""

""I...I-I-I...I _just_..."" Veiq stuttered again.

I didn't give her a moment to consider that. ""Then temper yourself with knowing the ones you will have to shoot at minimum did _nothing_ to protest their Caste's activities, and at worst, **_actively encouraged it.""_**

She went silent at that, but her shaking barely subsided. I continued. ""They don't deserve mercy. Not after what they've helped propagate!"" I growled. I finished strapping the last bit of the harness to myself, and began loading select weaponry I could carry in some bulk...or at least...that _Veiq_ could carry. ""So if you can't cover me, then get over here, grab _as many_ weapons as you can reasonably carry, and _help me_ carry it closer to Wing 8! The predators we're breaking out will need them.""

I hefted the rotary grenade launcher, and fastened to a side latch. It dangled awkwardly, but the back strap was not made to work with my bristling spines, and this would have to do. I lifted a rifle, checking its magazine one last time, before I clipped it shut once again, and holstered the other dead guard's sidearm.

As I stepped outside the armory, I turned on the door as it closed, and shot the keycard scanner. I would not risk any of the guards trying to arm quickly from my incursion, or know what we're carrying from the weapons absence.

With a comical amount of guns held in Veiq's arms, and more attached to my harness, there was but one last thought on my mind.

_They were no better than the Arxur._ _And for that…the Shadow Caste must_ **_burn._**

Thoughts on AI and DePIN Projects for 2024?,DePINside,1gmj55o,2024-11-08 08:58:59,8,0.91,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/DePINside/comments/1gmj55o/thoughts_on_ai_and_depin_projects_for_2024/,YogurtclosetTall2558,,"I’ve been pretty deep into the DePIN world lately, especially as we’re seeing more projects that integrate AI and blockchain. Projects like Akash Network and Helium have been making a solid case for decentralized cloud services and IoT networks that don’t rely on big centralized players. The way they’re building these services, it feels like there’s potential here to challenge the traditional systems we’ve all been used to.

What’s especially interesting to me is how some of these DePIN projects are adding AI into the mix. I’ve been keeping an eye on Rivalz Network for example, they’re doing something a bit different by creating an AI-powered decentralized infrastructure where users can earn passive income by running zNodes. From what I understand, their zNodes don’t just act as regular validators; they help process data for AI applications and real-world assets (think tokenization of things like property or other physical assets). They’ve also got rClients, which contribute storage directly from users’ devices.

The project has grown a lot since their testnet launch, reaching over 17 million transactions and 220,000 participants. They’re aiming to support more intensive AI applications as demand grows, and they’re working on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which would let them process encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first—a pretty big move for data privacy.

It seems like DePIN as a whole has picked up steam in 2024. We’re seeing some interesting returns, and the space is attracting more attention from investors who are looking for something that combines utility and returns beyond just speculation. There’s talk that tokens like IOTA for IoT, Golem for decentralized computing, and Akash for cloud services could pave the way for a more distributed infrastructure that’s not tied down by centralized providers.

But back to Rivalz Network, they recently secured $9 million in funding, and they’re looking to integrate with systems like Dymension, Celestia, and Eigen through a RollApp model to improve scalability and data flow. They’ve also opened up zNode delegation on the NodeOps App, with rewards for early participants starting on October 20th, which could be a good option for those who want to get in on the action without the full commitment of setting up hardware.

Curious to hear if anyone else is exploring these AI and DePIN projects. What’s on your radar? Are you more bullish on AI-driven infrastructure like Rivalz, or are you sticking with established projects like Helium and Akash?"

**McCoy Global $MCCRF $MCB.TO**

Market cap: 99m

Company Overview

McCoy Global develops equipment and technology for the energy and industrial sectors, especially oil and gas. Their lineup includes tools like hydraulic power tongs and digital solutions like smartHUB and Virtual Thread-Rep, which are designed to streamline operations and bring data insights to drilling sites. 

  


**Highlights**

McCoy’s last quarter was pretty solid. They pulled in $19.9m in revenue, up 23% from last year (not bad for a company in a cyclical industry). Earnings had a major boost too. Net income shot up by 119%, landing at $3.1m compared to $1.4m last year.

One big reason McCoy’s doing well is their FMS tool. This tool makes the process of handling pipes a lot easier and safer. Instead of needing extra manual tools, the FMS has replaceable parts that grip and release pipes quickly, which means fewer crew members are needed on the job. This setup saves both time and money for operators, which is why field crews are starting to rely on it, especially in tough conditions where efficiency and safety are key. Simply put, the FMS is solving real problems, and that’s why it’s boosting McCoy’s sales.

McCoy’s growth is also coming from a big push into international markets, especially in the Eastern Hemisphere. They used to be focused mainly on North America, but now, around 60% of their revenue is coming from overseas.

This matters because it makes them less dependent on any one region. Their tools, like the FMS, are catching on with companies abroad who are focused on efficiency. By spreading their business across more markets, they set themselves up with a more reliable revenue stream, even if one area slows down.

Also, they got $9 million in cash and no debt, giving them the flexibility to keep growing without needing outside financing

  


**Zoomd Technologies Ltd. $ZMDTF $ZOMD.V\\**

Market cap: 52m (already up 30% since my post on them last month)

Their tech helps brands navigate advertising channels outside major platforms like Google and Meta, providing a unified service for customer acquisition across various media types. Zoomd’s platform allows clients to efficiently manage and optimize ad campaigns on multiple channels, from social media to programmatic ad networks, all while maintaining clear, KPI-based results.



**Highlights**

Zoomd brought in $22.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2024, up 30% from last year. By focusing in on their core, high-performing products, they’ve made a strong turnaround with net income hitting $2.1 million in Q2 2024 compared to previous losses. They cut operating expenses by 21%, which helped drive adjusted ebitda to $3.03m, nearly 700% higher than last year. This shift toward core services and discontinuing less profitable products is clearly doing well for them.

Zoomd’s approach is a big plus for brands aiming to grow internationally. Their platform makes reaching audiences across regions like North America and Europe easier by offering a range of media options, so brands aren’t limited by regional ad restrictions. This flexibility gives companies the reach they need to effectively connect with global markets.

Another strength for Zoomd is their client retention. Their top 10 clients have stayed with them for over three years on average, which speaks to strong client satisfaction and effective campaign management. With this high retention and a diverse client base, Zoomd is building a steady stream of recurring revenue as they continue to expand globally.

  
  


**Golden Lake Exploration $GOLXF $GLM.CN**

Market cap: 6m (first post was around 3m)

Company Overview

Golden Lake Exploration is a junior mining company focused on the Jewel Ridge property in Nevada's Battle Mountain-Eureka Gold Trend, a prolific gold-producing area.



**Highlights**

Jewel Ridge is in a great location within the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend, an area that has produced over 40 million ounces of gold historically. This site is surrounded by major projects like i-80 Gold's (540M MC)  Ruby Hill, which has over 7.73 million ounces of gold, and McEwen Mining’s (633M MC) Gold bar project.

Historical drilling at Jewel Ridge has shown promising results. Notable intercepts include **56.39 meters of 1.24 g/t gold and 10.67 meters of 4.79 g/t gold.**

The Eureka Tunnel target is another highlight, yielding **3.23 meters of 57.16 g/t gold, 452.03 g/t silver, 7.23% lead, and 11.99% zinc**. This intercept resulted in Eric Sprott building a position in the company as one of the top shareholders.

I’m mentioning GLM in this post because they just recently started drilling and have some very promising targets. One of the key areas is Magnet Ridge, which spans an 800-meter-long anomaly in a well-known gold corridor. This anomaly was identified through geophysical surveys and shows a strong chargeability response, hinting at the potential for sulphide minerals, which are associated with precious metals. I’m expecting these drill results to be released in the next few weeks.

Earlier drilling nearby hit 5.13 g/t gold over 5.43 meters near the surface. Now, they’re going deeper into the core of the anomaly, where the chargeability is 10x stronger, making it a much more interesting target. With promising geology and high-priority drill spots, this setup looks pretty solid. I just think there is a decent chance for some good finds, and the current risk-to-reward isn’t bad at all, considering if they hit anything like they did in the past, it could run hard in this market. 

Plus, that is only the target I am most optimistic about, they have some other solid ones as well.

You can ask it to generate items, lore, full blown locations with specific interests etc.

As an example, a single prompt ""Make a steam punk styled land. full lore, complete detailed progression map"" gave me this:

# Lore: The Brasswild Expanse

The **Brasswild Expanse** is a sprawling, steampunk-inspired land of clanking gears, towering steel spires, and vast fields of mechanical contraptions that stretch out under a smoke-streaked sky. Once a fertile land teeming with life, it has become a place where iron and steam have replaced grass and trees, and where invention and industry outpace nature and tradition. Here, airships sail over dark, soot-stained valleys, their intricate gears gleaming in the dull light of a smog-covered sun. This is a land where steam engines are as common as beasts, and where every corner holds the rusted relics of some half-forgotten invention.

# The Creation of the Brasswild

The Brasswild was not always a land of iron and gears. Centuries ago, it was known as **Verdelind Fields**, a fertile basin where the winds ran free and green forests carpeted the landscape. When the visionary inventor **Archibald Kepler** arrived, he brought with him dreams of a utopia powered by endless ingenuity and the unbreakable spirit of innovation. What began as small clockwork constructs to aid in farming soon grew into something else—massive, smoke-belching machines that tilled fields, harvested resources, and transformed landscapes with ruthless efficiency.

However, Kepler’s vision became warped as industry consumed Verdelind. Natural resources dwindled, forests were razed, and rivers redirected to power ever-larger machines. What was once a paradise became an iron-laden, soot-stained wasteland, devoid of natural life, transformed fully into the **Brasswild Expanse**.

# Regions of the Brasswild Expanse

1. **Ironhold City**
   * The heart of the Brasswild, **Ironhold City** is a sprawling metropolis built from towering iron skyscrapers, where steam whistles pierce the thick smog and gears turn day and night. Every surface of Ironhold is covered in layers of soot and rust, and the streets are a web of iron bridges, narrow alleys, and suspended walkways.
   * **The Cogwell District**: This industrial heart of Ironhold houses towering factories, where workers toil among steam-driven machines, and blacksmiths craft clockwork creatures to patrol the streets. Here, thick steam pipes snake along every wall, with vents hissing clouds of smog.
   * **The Helix Markets**: A bustling marketplace housed within a series of suspended platforms and walkways. Artisans sell intricate mechanical trinkets, experimental weapons, and prototype gadgets, while vendors peddle food grown in strange steam-powered greenhouses.
   * **Kepler’s Tower**: A massive clock tower that serves as a grim monument to Archibald Kepler, the visionary responsible for the transformation of Verdelind Fields into the Brasswild Expanse. The tower’s brass gears grind ceaselessly, echoing the ambition that drove Kepler’s creations.
   * **The Gearlock Arena**: Beneath the city lies a massive, arena where inventors showcase their latest automatons and steam-powered constructs in violent combat. The city’s elite and common folk alike gather to witness these clashes, betting fortunes on the victors.
2. **The Rustmarch Plains**
   * Beyond Ironhold City, the **Rustmarch Plains** stretch out as far as the eye can see, a desolate expanse of red-stained dust and rusting machinery left to decay. Once fertile farmland, it is now overrun with abandoned harvesters, broken tillers, and the remnants of early, failed prototypes.
   * **The Spineway**: An ancient railway that cuts through the plains, once used to ferry resources into Ironhold. Now largely defunct, the Spineway has become the haunt of wandering traders and scavengers, who navigate its rusted tracks in search of spare parts and forgotten relics.
   * **The Gutter Sea**: A massive, oily lake formed by runoff from Ironhold City’s smelting operations. The waters are slick with chemicals, bubbling with toxic gases, and entirely inhospitable. Some daring scavengers still venture here, searching the murky depths for precious metals.
   * **The Derelict Spire**: A lone, crumbling tower that rises from the center of the plains. Originally an outpost of Archibald Kepler’s early workers, it now serves as a shelter for exiled inventors and outcasts who tinker in solitude with experimental machinery.
3. **Emberclad Range**
   * A mountainous region bordering the Brasswild, the **Emberclad Range** is home to mineral-rich peaks mined relentlessly by the residents of Ironhold. The mountain range is scarred by enormous mining rigs and crawling with mechanical drills and automated haulers.
   * **The Ironshaft Mines**: An extensive network of mineshafts where steam-powered lifts carry miners deep into the mountain’s core. Mechanical drills echo through the tunnels, digging endlessly in search of rare minerals to feed the furnaces of Ironhold.
   * **The Furnace Falls**: A natural hot spring turned into a boiling cauldron, polluted by metal runoff from the Emberclad mines. The falls are frequented by inventors and engineers looking for inspiration, claiming the heat stirs their creativity.
   * **Skyhold Outpost**: A military outpost carved into the highest peak, fortified with brass cannons and clockwork sentries. The outpost monitors the skies for threats and launches airships to defend the borders of the Brasswild.
4. **The Cloudspire Valley**
   * A strange, mist-laden valley filled with dense clouds of steam, where towering wind turbines dot the landscape and airships drift above the fog. The valley is a hub for aerial commerce, where airships are loaded with precious cargo bound for distant lands.
   * **The Drift Market**: A floating marketplace strung together from connected airship platforms and held in place by anchored dirigibles. Here, merchants trade in exotic resources, rare metals, and unique inventions brought in from beyond the Brasswild.
   * **Nimbus Station**: An airship docking hub at the edge of the valley, surrounded by massive cranes and storage warehouses. It serves as the main port for cargo entering and leaving the Brasswild.
   * **The Shrouded Forge**: Hidden deep within the valley, this forge is run by a secretive guild of artisans who craft the most advanced machinery and experimental weaponry in the Brasswild. The location of the forge is guarded fiercely, and only those deemed worthy are granted access.

# Timeline of Brasswild’s Industrial Rise

1. **The Founding of Verdelind Fields** (Year 0): Verdelind Fields is a thriving agricultural land, dotted with small villages and forest groves. The people live in harmony with nature, relying on traditional farming methods and modest trade.
2. **Arrival of Archibald Kepler** (Year 45): Kepler arrives, bringing with him strange machines and radical ideas. Initially welcomed for his innovations in farming, he establishes a small settlement that will eventually grow into Ironhold City.
3. **The Age of the Brass Revolution** (Year 80): Kepler’s machines spread across Verdelind, transforming fields into clockwork farms. Woodlands are cleared to build smelting furnaces, and vast tracts of land are mined for fuel. The area is rebranded as the **Brasswild Expanse**.
4. **The Great Smog Era** (Year 130): The Brasswild Expanse becomes known for its pollution. Ironhold City is perpetually shrouded in smog, and the once-vibrant landscape is rendered barren. Rivers run black with waste, and forests are reduced to stumps. Opposition to Kepler’s expansion grows.
5. **Revolt of the Green Hand** (Year 160): A faction of former farmers and environmentalists rises up, calling themselves the **Green Hand**. They sabotage Kepler’s factories and disrupt Ironhold’s production. After a brutal campaign, Kepler’s enforcers crush the revolt, driving the Green Hand into hiding.
6. **Expansion into the Emberclad Range** (Year 175): Ironhold’s resources begin to dwindle, prompting Kepler’s heirs to establish mining operations in the Emberclad Range. The mountains are rich in minerals, but their exploitation scars the land and poisons the nearby Furnace Falls.
7. **Emergence of the Drift Market** (Year 200): With natural resources nearly exhausted, the Brasswild opens trade with neighboring regions. The Drift Market is established in Cloudspire Valley, drawing merchants and travelers who bring new resources and ideas to the land.
8. **The Current Era** (Year 215): The Brasswild Expanse remains a land of machines and metal. The city of Ironhold dominates, its factories running day and night. Pollution has created a dense, unending smog that blankets the landscape. Outlaws and scavengers roam the Rustmarch Plains, while inventors push the limits of technology within Ironhold’s walls, disregarding the consequences.

# Points of Interest

1. **The Cog-Forge of Ironhold**: The largest and oldest factory in Ironhold, where machines of every kind are manufactured. The Cog-Forge is a sprawling complex that has produced everything from clockwork soldiers to airships and automatons. Rumors suggest that deep within its bowels, forbidden experiments are conducted, crafting machinery that defies nature.
2. **The Ironbridge Monastery**: A relic of an older time, this abandoned monastery on the outskirts of the Rustmarch Plains was once a refuge for those seeking peace. Now, it serves as a hideout for Green Hand rebels who still plot the downfall of Ironhold.
3. **The Smoke-Eater**: A legendary airship constructed in the Shrouded Forge, known for its stealth and unmatched speed. It is captained by a notorious smuggler who defies Ironhold’s rule, ferrying goods and fugitives to distant lands.
4. **Kepler’s Folly**: A colossal, partially completed statue of Archibald Kepler, abandoned when funds ran dry. The statue now serves as a grim reminder of the cost of unchecked ambition, and scavengers have repurposed its hollow interior into a temporary shelter.

In the Brasswild Expanse, power is purchased with the iron price, and every innovation demands sacrifice. The people who remain are bound to the grind of the machines, tethered to a land that hums with life—yet no longer breathes.

""I want unique items, enemies, and a BBEG (Big bad evil guy) for this place""

# Unique Items of the Brasswild Expanse

1. **The Smogheart Amulet**
   * A glass pendant filled with swirling, dense smog, sealed within an iron frame. When worn, the amulet allows the user to cloak themselves in a dark mist, becoming harder to detect. However, extended use gradually poisons the wearer’s lungs, inflicting a persistent cough and eventual bouts of breathlessness.
2. **The Clockwork Lens**
   * This brass eyepiece is a marvel of microengineering, with tiny gears that shift and adjust automatically when worn. It allows the wearer to see hidden machinery, detect clockwork traps, and read long-forgotten blueprints with ease. However, the lens induces painful migraines if used for too long, and may even drive the wearer to brief, dangerous fits of madness.
3. **Kepler’s Key**
   * A deceptively simple iron key that is heavily sought after by engineers and scavengers. It’s rumored that this key can unlock the most well-guarded doors in Ironhold City, including Kepler’s hidden vault beneath his tower. Using it, however, comes at a cost, as it slowly saps the user’s vitality, growing colder with every turn until it’s deadly to touch.
4. **The Embercore Pistol**
   * A heavy brass pistol with an ornately carved barrel, containing a tiny piece of coal from the Furnace Falls. When fired, it unleashes a burst of scorching flames, igniting whatever it strikes. However, its heat is volatile, and the user risks burns if the pistol is overused, forcing them to wait as it cools down.
5. **The Soot-Bound Gauntlet**
   * A reinforced, soot-stained glove imbued with enchanted brass. It grants the wearer increased strength and a resistance to fire but at a cost: each use blackens the wearer’s skin, eventually turning their arm into a stiff, soot-covered husk.

# Enemies of the Brasswild Expanse

1. **Rust Reavers**
   * These spider-like constructs scuttle along the Brasswild, scavenging metal scraps for Ironhold’s factories. Their sharp, clanging limbs and iron-fanged maws can tear through steel, making them incredibly dangerous. When they detect intruders, they swarm, ripping their targets apart with ruthless efficiency. They also leak a corrosive oil that rusts any metal it touches, rendering weapons brittle and useless.
2. **Smog Wraiths**
   * Dark figures that drift through the thickest patches of smog, these eerie wraiths are the spectral remnants of those who died in Ironhold’s earliest factories. Their bodies appear like distorted, translucent shapes shrouded in smoke, and their touch drains life from the living, leaving a burning, frostbitten mark. They haunt the outskirts of Ironhold and the Rustmarch Plains, their chilling whispers echoing through the fog.
3. **Brass Talons**
   * Enforcers in Ironhold, these elite mechanical soldiers were once human but have undergone severe augmentations, their bodies melded with brass plating and gears. They patrol Ironhold with iron fists, quelling dissent with brutal efficiency. Brass Talons can emit bursts of steam to knock back or burn opponents and use retractable, razor-sharp claws to strike down intruders. They have a single-minded loyalty to Ironhold’s leaders, driven by a mix of loyalty and programming.
4. **The Cog-Riven Beasts**
   * Born from the failed experiments of the Shrouded Forge, these monstrosities are beasts melded with machinery. They possess crude, steam-powered limbs and iron jaws filled with serrated gears. Their twisted, snarling forms are barely held together by bolts and rusted metal, leaking oil and blood. Although their minds are fractured, they are relentless, lunging at anything living in their path, driven by the agony of their existence.
5. **Gutter Golems**
   * Found lurking around the Gutter Sea, these golems are hulking figures composed of mud, oil, and bits of scrap metal held together by ancient magic. They are slow but tremendously strong, able to crush stone and bone alike. They protect the toxic waters, attacking any who approach too close, as if driven by a buried, forgotten purpose. Destroying them is nearly impossible; even if shattered, they reassemble themselves from the surrounding sludge and debris.

# Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG): The Iron Prophet, Valten Forgefane

Once a devoted disciple of Archibald Kepler, **Valten Forgefane** rose through the ranks of Ironhold’s elite with a terrifying blend of charisma and brutality. Forgefane believed that Kepler’s vision of industry and invention had the potential to elevate humanity beyond its mortal limits. Over the years, he became obsessed with perfecting the “human machine,” fusing flesh with metal and bending machinery to his will. He is a towering figure, his body a grotesque fusion of flesh and iron—his chest reinforced with brass plating, his eyes replaced with rotating clockwork lenses, and his right arm transformed into a massive steam-powered gauntlet capable of crushing iron.

Driven by his twisted ideology, Forgefane views himself as a “prophet of progress,” claiming that the path of iron and steam is humanity’s salvation. Under his rule, Ironhold City has become a place of fear and innovation in equal measure, its inhabitants molded into cogs within his grand design. His vision is not just to control the Brasswild but to expand it, turning every land into a reflection of his industrial utopia—at any cost.

# Abilities

* **The Furnace Pulse**: Forgefane’s heart has been replaced with a molten ember core that fuels his monstrous body. With a mere thought, he can release a powerful pulse of searing heat, scorching any living thing within a short radius. This ability leaves his foes with blistering burns and fills the air with thick, choking smog.
* **Command of the Brass Talons**: Forgefane controls a vast network of augmented soldiers, the Brass Talons, who obey his orders without question. With a single command, he can summon waves of these enforcers to his aid, turning the battlefield into a mechanical nightmare.
* **Machinery of Flesh**: Forgefane’s steam-powered limbs grant him superhuman strength and endurance. He can crush steel and hurl enemies aside with ease, and he feels no pain, driven purely by his deranged ideology. Any injury he sustains is rapidly repaired by tiny automaton drones that crawl over his body, soldering wounds shut with precision.
* **Smog-Wrought Vision**: His clockwork eyes grant him vision through dense fog, allowing him to spot enemies hiding within the Brasswild’s infamous smog. They also allow him to identify weak points in his opponents, which he exploits with ruthless efficiency.

# Lair: The Iron Basilica

The **Iron Basilica** is Forgefane’s citadel, a fortress of brass and iron that rises ominously over Ironhold City. Its towering spires and smokestacks loom like the chimneys of a massive, infernal factory, spewing black smoke into the already thickened sky. Inside, the Iron Basilica is a labyrinth of whirring gears, hydraulic lifts, and darkened corridors illuminated only by the flickering light of coal fires and glowing steam vents.

At the heart of the Basilica lies the **Chamber of Forging**, where Forgefane conducts his experiments on flesh and metal. This is a place of horrific transformation, where unlucky captives are twisted into his Brass Talons or Cog-Riven Beasts. Massive metal slabs serve as operating tables, surrounded by dangling tools and automated limbs poised to cut, solder, and stitch.

# Final Showdown with Forgefane

Confronting Valten Forgefane in the Chamber of Forging is a daunting task. He uses the Iron Basilica’s inner mechanisms to his advantage, summoning Brass Talons and activating traps in the floor that erupt with blasts of steam. He retreats to higher ground when pressed, using his Furnace Pulse to sear the air, turning the chamber into a haze of scorching smoke. As his body takes damage, the small drones repair him almost instantly, dragging the fight out with relentless efficiency.

In his final moments, as his machinery begins to fail and his clockwork heart splutters, Forgefane becomes desperate, tearing off pieces of his own machinery to hurl at his attackers. His final words, though filled with rage, echo his deranged vision: “You cannot stop progress… I *am* progress!”

Upon his defeat, the Iron Basilica’s defenses collapse, leaving Ironhold City vulnerable for the first time in decades. Yet his vision, his mark on the Brasswild Expanse, remains—a warning of what ambition without restraint can create."

In the hours of darkness when the powers of the dead breach the sanctuaries of the living, penetrating the faith of conscious thought with a spear fashioned from fear and lucid nightmare, you can stare into the sky for the comforts of the heavenly bodies. Light shines down from them in easy embrace, carrying your troubled heart through the terrors of nightfall. Many stars make up the heavens, each a beacon of hope, passing your weary eyes between them. Night after night, they dance in roving constellations, shielding you from ephialtes. Amongst them all a lone star sits twinkling: [Dwayna’s Heart](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwayna%27s_Heart). It does not dance. In your troubles you sought succor from heavenly bodies such as these. They staved sleep and granted sweet dreams. But what happens when they too are beset by the powers of darkness? What can you possibly offer them that would help them sparkle any brighter? Or pirouette with added grace?

.

**Is Dwayna’s Heart the Rift?**

The Rift sits in the center of the heavens and houses the [Hall of Heroes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Hall_of_Heroes). Those Tyrian eyes blessed enough to see it should never notice it move. Is Dwayna’s Heart the Rift? I’m struggling to find a reason not to think so. I believe that those mortals who spot the Rift – and the hall within it - have True Sight; they are chosen by the spirits to walk The Golden Path.

.

**The Theory of True Sight, the Golden Path, and Alchemy**

*""Have you ever been to the Hall of Heroes before? I'm told that, within the Rift, the light of the sun does not reach. Instead, the hall is graced with an unearthly, primal light that cannot be described with words. I hope these skills will allow me to see it:""* **-** [Blahks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Blahks).

*""We regret to inform the people of Gavril that our guiding knight, so ardent, has passed; Justiciar Rhea, our eyes are on your back as you walk up the golden path. Her battle against illness was brief, and sadly, it was quickly lost...but every swing was radiant. A memorial will be held for Rhea in the coming days. Listen for song, you'll know what to do."" -* [Gavril Town Notice: Memorial for Justiciar Rhea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Waterproof_Chest).

True Sight is the ability to see, with the naked eye, the colors of magic. There are at least six colors: three primary (red (represented by entities like [Balthazar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Balthazar) and [Primordus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primordus)), green (portrayed by the likes of [Melandru](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Melandru) and [Mordremoth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordremoth)), blue (symbolized by [Dwayna](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwayna) and the Deep Sea Dragon); one secondary (purple (the color of [Lyssa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lyssa) and [Kralkatorrik](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kralkatorrik))); and two tertiary (white (associated with [Jormag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jormag)) and black (grouped with [Grenth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grenth) and [Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zhaitan)); and may be as many as eight, the missing colors being yellow ([Kormir’s](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kormir) hue) and cyan (possibly the color of the [Nightmare Incarnate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Nightmare_Incarnate) and the Tower of Nightmares). These magical colors have been mapped, in various configurations, by a range of alchemists. The maps are presented in a table below:

.

Note that none of these maps are identical, though they all seem to draw upon the same set of primary colors (red, green, and blue).

The Golden Path is a Mist-wide ley line network of *golden magical light*. It can be traced through time and space to its origin point: the unearthly, primal light that radiates from the Hall of Heroes. I theorize that in the past chosen mystics, from races like the jotun, have walked the Golden Path. They likened it to a dragon and entrusted their fellow mortals with customs and traditions designed to ensure that, should the True Sight of mortals go blind, access to the Hall of Heroes would never be denied the souls of the dead.

Alchemy is the practice of transmuting gold. I strongly believe that those with True Sight can use alchemy to help them focus their *mind's eye*, thus allowing them to mix the magical colors, revealing the Golden Path. One end of this path - of which there are many - is Ascension. This latter blessing is a state of perfect harmony between magic and mortal flesh, known as divinity, in which the metabolic processes of the divine produce no torment.

In principle, if the sighted can produce golden light from the magical colors, they can find the Golden Path. And therein lies the problem, the root cause of all of Tyria's recent tragedy: no one can find the Golden Path because no one can produce golden light from the magical colors. Yet the maps presented above demonstrate that the sighted have plenty to work with. In the real world, those familiar with light-work would say that all you need to create a golden light is a combination of red, green, and blue. From this we can deduce that the nature of the challenge facing the sighted is mental, not corporeal. It is the *mind's eye*, not simply the eyes, that must be opened, *focused*. In the past mystics turned to artifacts like the [Vision Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vision_Crystal) to help them do this.

Surely there is a Tyrian somewhere who can help us find a focusing crystal? If that is all the sighted need to find and walk the Golden Path, then let's go get a crystal! There was a mystic who found *the* Vision Crystal, Turai Ossa. Turai's legend teaches us a hard lesson: Nothing is ever as easy as it seems.

*""\[Turai\] Ossa sought...Ascension, a state of communion with the gods. He knew the path to that ideal ran through the wasteland north of Elona...Turai and his followers then began a great pilgrimage, marching north into the Crystal Desert, where the gods once walked among men. His loyal entourage erected temples, raising pillars toward the heavens... but Ascension eluded him. Instead of everlasting life, he found the torment of eternal living death. In ghostly form, he still walks the earth. Many of his followers died as well, and their ghosts have remained in the Crystal Desert."" -* [The Guild Wars Nightfall Manuscripts](https://legal.guildwars.com/en/docs/gwn-manual-en.pdf), p. 21.

Turai's procession journeyed into the [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert), geography known for its abundant crystal. Assuming *someone* in Ossa's following had True Sight, there was no shortage of foci to help them find the Golden Path. Yet even with the Vision Crystal to guide them Turai's group could not escape the rolling dunes of the endless sand sea, and perished. Carpers must have a field day with this misadventure. Does a mortal wish to find the Golden Path, to reach the Hall of Heroes? Why bother? Lord Odran's already done the hard work for you: Get to the [Tomb of the Primeval Kings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Primeval_Kings).

The resting place of the monarchs of the [Primeval Dynasty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primeval_Dynasty) is just one of likely countless points - including the [Battle Isles](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Battle_Isles) \- through which Lord Odran accessed the Hall of Heroes. Turai Ossa ventured into the Crystal Desert in 1068DR, at least sixteen years after Lord Odran achieved notoriety, well after the bodies of the dead kings were interred, so why didn't he use the tombs to help locate the Golden Path? Perhaps he simply didn't realize that he could do so? Odran hid his passages with wards and enchantments, spells which only began to fail at his passing; and as we don't know *when* Odran died, it is within reason to think that, less than two decades after he reached the Rift, the wizard's magics would be intact.

The concept of Ascension ignites associations with divinity. Turai wanted to ascend. Did the gods summon him to the Crystal Desert to replace their fallen sibling, Abaddon? Godhood is transcendence. You don't prepare a mortal for divinity by teaching them to repeat the mistakes of their fellows. Lord Odran enraged the spirits of the hallowed afterlife when he violated the Hall of Heroes. In life, he showed regard for neither the living - sacrificing many souls - nor the dead. Would you let someone like that ascend? I wouldn't. As far as I am concerned, Lord Odran and his legacy - the many portals through which mortals can reach the hall - are both tainted and those who leverage them forfeit claims to Ascension; they have become a test set by the spirits, designed to separate those who might ascend from those who will be forgotten. If Turai was guided by the gods, this may be the real reason why he didn't use Lord Odran's legacy to help him follow the Golden Path. The gods didn't want him to.

You can be sure that mortals who reach the Hall of Heroes through Lord Odran's legacy deserve to be forgotten, for they are nothing like the wizard. At least Odran simply passed through the hall. The adventurers who followed him began using the hall as an [arena](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Hall_of_Heroes_(arena)). The practice soon became the norm and the spirits, clearly unable to prevent the desecration of their rest, turned to playing corporeal trespassers against each other to try and stem the tide. The dead wish to dream the dream of endless sleep and so, I suspect, they plotted to eventually restore order to the hall, making some progress with the devastation of the Battle Isles in 1219AE. To do so, they began studying the corporeal forms of the many combatants, learning their weaknesses. Frankly, I believe that the spirits are entirely justified in their desire to reinstate peace at the hall. The Rift is more than just a destination, it is *""the point of perfect balance between all forces of the universe""*. If you think of the Mists and all that is within them - the multiverse, the universe, reality itself etc. - as a spell, the Rift is a weak point of that spell at which you can, quite literally, counter the spell, collapsing everything into Void. Void is described by [Kunavaang](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fallout) as *""raw magic - chaos incarnate"".* It is a powerful expression of chaos magic, a maelstrom too wild for all but the most competent spell casters to tame. One way to stir magic into a chaotic void-like state is to pit mortal magicians against each other in lethal combat. Except in this case, they aren't practising magic in a backwater; they're trading blows in the resting place of heroes. Think about the potential power of the spells mortals cast there. The spirit of a hero interred at the hall is a memory of some of the most potent magic, ever. A mortal drawing upon that may experience a surge unlike anything they've felt before. It is easy to see why magicians could lose control of this magic and, in fact, mortals probably already have.

I think that the Vision Crystal was symbolic of a greater artifact, the Bloodstone, and the blood of the beings from which the stone was forged, dragonkind. The task of reassembling the Vision Crystal failed because the chosen amongst Turai's procession could not focus their True Sight. This inability to focus traces its origin back not only to the the splitting of the Bloodstone, but also to the Fall of Abaddon. The Orrian History Scrolls tell us that Abaddon's memory was unlike that of any other deity: He alone could recall what passed beyond in the Mists. This penetrating evocation meant that Abaddon knew how the Bloodstone was cleft; he conferred this memory to the sighted. Hence, when Abaddon fell it blinded the mind's eye of the chosen. They could see the magical colors and continue to mix them, but they were no longer able to produce golden light or walk the path it illuminated.

Turai Ossa's legacy is memorialized as failure, doomed to be repeated by his [bloodline](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Varesh_Ossa). Alive, he could not ascend. In [death](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ghostly_Hero_(PvE)), he tried to gain entry to the Hall of Heroes through one of Lord Odran's portals, betraying the will of the gods. Tyrian history offers us few examples of people like Turai, mortal heroes called to ascend, though I believe another has been produced: [Saul D'Alessio](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Saul_D%27Alessio).

.

**Dragons and True Sight**

In my opinion, dragonkind collectively represents True Sight. Dragons who survey the heavens can see the magical light shining from the Rift, observing said magic flowing to them through the Mist-wide ley line network known by mortals as the constellation dragon. Crucially though, dragons cannot see the Golden Path - not even Glint and her legacy - meaning that no one species of dragon can *focus* the species' True Sight. But Glint and her offspring have shared some of what they see and know of the Rift with Tyrians. This impartation represents a part-focus of the True Sight of mortal chosen. The limitations of the sight of Glint and her Legacy is demonstrated through numerous sources, including these:

* *""Prophecy is not always a gift. Often I see things I wish I hadn't. But when the vision is clouded, I am most uneasy. The heroes have gathered, and Kralkatorrik approaches. I am not yet prepared to face the Elder Dragon—and distressingly,* ***I cannot see beyond the coming battle***. *Is it because I die? I can't die without finishing my work. I have to stop Kralkatorrik. The Forgotten told me much, but not everything... What did they tell the Six? What do the gods know that I do not? So much is unclear, but I'm out of time. I must keep my faith, and hope that my children will carry on my legacy.""*  \- [Glint](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline_Memories).
* *""Glint's words say little of these days after Kralkatorrik's fall—she could not share all she knew, for fear of affecting the outcome of events. We will keep our faith and believe in Aurene's future."" -* [Dulann, Luminate's Envoy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dulann,_Luminate%27s_Envoy).
* *""It's wonderful to see you. Even with Jormag and Primordus gone, I notice Tyria's still standing.* *Seems the Exalted were a bit off in their predictions. That's why I wanted to see you. I've begun to...perceive something. A distant presence. An ancient presence. It's a ripple in the Mists. Like a dolphin in the deep, sounding to sense what's out there. And I want to respond. But before I do, I check my visions. All my possible futures converge to one point. Today. And* ***I can't see past it***...*\[Now\] i'm not sure of anything. Except my urge to respond. To say, ""Yes, I'm here!"" I'm intrigued! I'm intensely curious! And even if I die, we know I won't stay dead...Whatever it is, I can handle it. I just wanted to tell you, before it all...begins.""* \- [Aurene](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Good_to_See_You).
* *""The victories of this day will go down in history, Champion. Though we tread unknown paths, I am sure that this is the future Glint wished for. That Aurene made real with all of us.""* \- [Dulann, Luminate's Envoy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion%27s_End).

For mortal chosen, dragons like Glint and her Legacy are living embodiments of a partly reassembled Bloodstone, foci that partially restore their blinded minds, allowing them to see glimpses of the Golden Path. I posit that, were the blood of dragons to be combined through breeding, the resulting species would have the power to fully heal the mind's eye of the chosen.

**.**

**The Miracle of Saul D'Alessio**

*""Saul D'Alessio was a fallen man. A gambler and a drunk, Saul reached the lowest point in his life when he lost a bet he could not repay. At the time, the local betting house was run by the Lucky Horseshoe, a gambling guild whose influence spanned almost the entire length of the continent. To avoid defaulting on his payment, Saul took to robbing merchants traveling on the road from Beetletun to Shaemoor. Though he successfully paid his debt to the Lucky Horseshoe, he was eventually fingered by one of his victims and tried as a thief. His punishment was exile from the Kingdom of Kryta. The local authorities blindfolded him and rode him out three full weeks before leaving him to fend for himself.*

*Alone, broke, and lost, Saul wandered through a dense forest for several days, surviving on only roots and berries. On the fourth day, delirious with hunger, Saul emerged from the trees to see what he thought was a hallucination—a city of massive towers reaching into the heavens. The architecture was astounding, and the creatures who lived here were unlike any he had ever seen. Walking down into their city, Saul got a closer look at the denizens of this place. They were tall and thin with strange wing-like appendages that waved about in the slightest breeze. When they walked, their feet seemed not to touch the ground, and when they spoke, it was the most melodious sound he had ever heard. Surely these creatures were the stuff of divinity. Hungry and exhausted, his clothes ragged and dirty, Saul dropped to his knees and touched his forehead to the ground. He had found his gods, and they in turn had found their most devoted disciple."" -* [The Guild Wars Manuscripts](https://legal.guildwars.com/en/docs/gwp-manual.pdf)*, pp. 42-43.*

More than a millennia after the Fall of Abaddon, Tyrian history performed a miracle, producing Saul D'Alessio. This krytan man, I believe, could mix golden light from the magical colors. But his fortune was the product of chance, of chaotic magics over which he did not have control; Saul was always lucky like that. Now I wrote above that I think Abaddon's Fall disrupted the minds of chosen, making it impossible for them to focus their True Sight and so, walk the Golden Path. How, then, could Saul focus his? That is a very good question.

.

**The Evolution of the Gift of True Sight**

[An image of Rytlock, blindfolded. Those who walk the Golden Path will eventually reach a point, symbolised by the Realm of Torment, at which they can no longer rely on their vision \(for \\""Abaddon will eat your eyes\\""\) and must turn, instead, to their hearing.](https://preview.redd.it/xhst6a37tdxd1.jpg?width=296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46811127c48353e61f04772352f105ab062280fe)

*""Kasmeer: 'What's wrong with \[Mai\]?'*

*Marjory: 'Revenants can have a hard time tuning out all the voices from the Mists.'*

*Kasmeer*: *'Rytlock actually needed a blindfold at first, something to help him focus. This has been a day... Did you find that blindfold? Here. Take this.'*

*Mai*: *'Oh... Thank you. It's quiet.'"" -* [Can't Trust a Pirate, End of Dragons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Can%27t_Trust_a_Pirate).

The Gift of True Sight is changing. Before Abaddon fell, the chosen could focus their sight through eyes and mind alone. Afterward, recovering True Sight required the chosen to master their *hearing.* For the next thousand years, chosen who tapped into their sight would find themselves battling with the voices of antagonistic spirits, spectral beings that Abaddon's power normally shielded them from; these voices made it impossible for the chosen to focus. Yet, as Taimi once said, *""Magic finds its own path, like rivers running to the sea.""* Although Turai Ossa's venture into the Crystal Desert was beset by tragedy, his experiences were not in vain. Benevolent magic journeyed with him, sometimes carrying him, at other times consoling him, always learning what must be done to repair the relationship between itself and mortals. And thus, in the way that only benevolent magic can work, Saul D'Alessio was born.

Saul's legacy teaches us that the task of regaining the Gift of True Sight has been entrusted, primarily, to krytan humanity. It's not hard to see why. The [Canthan Calendar](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Canthan_calendar) measures time by the phases of the moon. The Elonian Calendar marks the passage of time by the years of a monarch's rule ([Dynastic Reckoning](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dynastic_Reckoning)). True Sight, though, looks through monarchs, past the moon, to the center of the Mists, chronicling events in relation to the Rift. The record of this last timekeeping practice is known as the [Mouvelian Calendar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mouvelian_calendar); it is maintained by krytan mystics and is the only calendar that documents events that affect True Sight, such as the [Exodus of the Gods](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Exodus_of_the_Gods) and the Folly of Lord Odran. These differing methods of counting time loosely correlate to the potential that each population of men has to produce chosen capable of Ascension.

Elona occasioned the Ossa line (including [Varesh](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Varesh_Ossa)), [Palawa Joko](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Palawa_Joko), and ultimately [Kormir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kormir). Turai had True Sight but could not focus it; Varesh had True Sight and found that only Abaddon could help her focus it, or so she thought; Palawa Joko fell victim to the fate of those rejected by the spirits, a hero whose ghost is denied entry into the Hall of Heroes, destined to remain forever trapped within the rotting flesh and rancid bones of his own corpse; and [Kormir's eyes were stolen from her](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Consulate_Docks).

Cantha forgot too much of the customs and traditions of the Golden Path, a failing related in the story of [Chanang](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Chang_Hai), such that the region gave rise to no chosen of worth. Chanang's story is told thus:

*""The departure of the gods and the almost simultaneous gift of magic had a profound effect on all human cultures, especially those in Cantha. The heroic professions—their formal practices and requirements still in infancy—became widespread. The eldest prince of the imperial line, Chanang, defied the wishes of his father and chose to follow the hero's path. He studied the ways of the Warrior and spent four years at a remote temple on the island of Shing Jea learning the holy practices of the Monk. Then he set out to perform great deeds as a true hero of Cantha.*

*Thanks to a small coterie of scribes that traveled with him, his exploits are still widely read in Cantha a thousand years later. Chanang became one of the first Canthan heroes to become Closer to the Stars (what in Tyria is referred to as ""ascension"") and, when the time came to succeed his father on the throne, he refused the title ""lord emperor"" and instead became the first ""ascendant emperor,"" changing his name to Chang Hai. Since then, all emperors have been required—by family tradition if not actual law—to practice in at least two of the heroic professions. Today, Kisu is the 31st Canthan emperor, but is also the 20th ascendant emperor."" -* [Loremaster Ermenred](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Loremaster_Ermenred), An Empire Divided.

Naysayers will point out that Chanang instituted customs and traditions that preserved the ability to focus True Sight through the ages, evidenced by [Weh no Su](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Weh_no_Su). To them, becoming closer to the stars demonstrates that Cantha was capable of producing chosen primed for Ascension. However, Tyrian history provides us with no examples of successful Canthan candidates. (Abaddon was succeeded by an Elonian, afterall.) Moreover, Chanang defied his father to achieve ""ascension"", disseminating his legend through a cadre of scribes who, as the story goes, accompanied him on his adventures. For all we know, Chanang abused his power to produce propaganda likening him to the gods. There is every possibility that Chanang's father was closer to the stars than his son and was the last of the Canthan imperial line to practice techniques that please the spirits.

Kryta unveiled Saul D'Alessio. Saul seemingly did what other chosen could not: He found the Golden City that lies at the end of the Golden Path.

*""The confessor left last week. Took everyone with him except a few of us. Tatyanna would cut her own arm off and eat it if it made him happy, so she's elated to see Caudecus's mission in Janthir to the end. Left Judge with us, too, but I'm worried he did that because the kid's a crappy cook. Too scared to kill a* *rabbit, so I guess we're eating* *potatoes until I can get out and hunt for us myself. They didn't leave us with much, but we wouldn't be on this path if it wasn't the right one.*

*Caudecus wants us to keep looking for the city, but we can't cross to the other isles without a headache or nosebleed. We're also dealing with some unwanted guests; didn't realize there were* *kodan in these parts. We've managed to stay out of sight, at least. Looks like some type of hunting party, so I'm not too worried about it, but we'll stay out of their way. Judge saw them row inland. Probably live* *somewhere on the mainland. Gonna lay low until they leave. We'll make our next arrangements after and see if we can get around whatever curse is keeping us from moving further in.""* \- [Ulrich's Journal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_History_Most_Violent:_Part_2).

*""Bava Nisos eludes us so completely, and my weaker half wants to doubt its existence. But doubt is failure. I've sent my entourage along the path Saul described numerous times to no avail, but they continue to march.*

*Last trip, I sent the cook with them—the urchin that calls himself Judge. Upon the party's return a few days later, the boy described a debilitating headache that struck midway through their crossing to the next isle. Only he was afflicted, but the headache grew worse the further they rowed. Tatyana turned them around when his nose started bleeding. This must be a test of some sort. A puzzle for me to unravel..."" -* [Travel Journal, A History Most Violent: Part II](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_History_Most_Violent:_Part_2)*.*

In my opinion, Saul D'Alessio was chosen by the deities to succeed Abaddon, but a conspiracy of chaotic magics derailed their plans and they were forced to settle for Kormir. Saul differed from Kormir in two respects: i) he found the Golden City that lies at the end of the Golden Path and ii) he kept his eyes. If we view Saul and Kormir as metaphors for True Sight, we see that Saul can call upon his *vision*, *hearing*, and *mind's eye* to help him walk the Golden Path, whereas Kormir can only draw upon her *hearing* and *mind's eye.* What does this mean? As I see it, Kormir cannot find one of the destinations that can only be reached along the Golden Path: the Golden City. Is this city [Divinity's Reach](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Divinity%27s_Reach)? [Tarir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tarir,_the_Forgotten_City)? [Amnytas](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Amnytas)? [Bava Nisos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bava_Nisos)? [Arah](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ruined_City_of_Arah)? The Hall of Heroes? No, it is these things and more. The Golden City is the place at which magic and mortals can coexist in perfect harmony, free from hindrances like torment. It is [Utopia](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Utopia). This state of being begins with the reunification of the pantheon. Yet recent history teaches us that the pantheon is approaching chaotic dysfunction. Abaddon fell; [Balthazar was ""demoted""](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Facing_the_Truth); there are hints that Lyssa is mortally wounded; Melandru and Grenth are missing-in-action; and Kormir's library contains a [book](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Poems_by_Danna,_Age_9) that casts doubt on Dwayna's truthfulness. The state of the pantheon is a way of measuring Kormir's progress along the Golden Path. She is lost along it. Mortals think of her as a goddess and would naturally assume that she has reached the Hall of Heroes, but her wounded state means that, with each new step, she is as likely to tear what is left of the pantheon apart as she is to reassemble it. In short, without her vision Kormir is doomed to fulfil the prophecies of the [Lost Spirits](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lost_Soul_(Gate_of_Pain)): *""A new god is born! A god that will destroy the others and bring about the end of the world! The cycle begins again!...\[For\] \[w\]hen you walk dark paths, you open your mind to the nightmare. Poor Kormir, poor sad goddess raised up to the stars, cursed to see only infinite blackness between them...."".* What is the solution to Kormir's dilemma? Her sight must be restored. And how shall this be accomplished? I believe that Saul's flesh holds the solution. The eyes that outlasted Saul's banishment in the bowels of the Maguuma must, somehow, become Kormir's own.

.

**Is Kormir Really a Goddess?**

Contemplating Kormir's predicament in the light of Saul D'Alessio's legend may leave you questioning her legitimacy. Is she a True God? You wouldn't be the first to think like this. [Mallyx the Unyielding](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mallyx_the_Unyielding) initially resisted Kormir's claim to Abaddon's throne. However, Kormir was able to subjugate Mallyx. I feel that this demonstrates that, though she has trouble imposing her will upon the [Realm of Torment](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Realm_of_Torment), she is nonetheless fated by the spirits to inherit all of it. Think of the Realm of Torment as a seething mass of Void magic that represents Kormir's potential, that part of her glory which she will wield when her sight is restored. Again, consider the Realm of Torment as a metaphor for the Gift of Water Magic as it is practiced by terrestrial mortals. Kormir must calm the turbulent waters at work in the gift before she can impart it to her worshippers. Because of this, the most influential spirits of the Hall of Heroes recognize Kormir, but will not let her find the hall until she has completed the task with which she has been entrusted. This is one of the responsibilities of divinity.

.

**Gavril and the Unique Nature of Saul's True Sight**

Following the decline of their mursaat overlords, the White Mantle spent considerable resources trying to focus the True Sight of the chosen among them. They had only the story of Saul's conversion to guide them. The most important part of that tale, to them, was Saul's discovery of the Golden City. (The Golden City was originally described as a construction of alabaster and gold filigree, in a version of Saul's conversion narrative in which his last name is not D'Alessio, but Bolton.) The city became a focus, something that the chosen of the White Mantle could use to fix their minds' eyes upon. No matter how hard they tried, though, they could not find the golden ley-lines that make up the Golden Path. More competent of their chosen experienced nausea and nose bleeds as they came up against the barriers to True Sight put in place by Abaddon's Fall, most notably around bodies of water. To reproduce the miracle of Saul D'Alessio they would need things that, seemingly, only chaos magic can provide. The circumstances of Saul's conversion include the following:

* **Mesmerism**. Saul was a gambler renowned for his luck. He may not have thought much of this at the time, but Saul's ability indicates that he was capable of wielding chaos magic with some skill.
* **Blindness.** Saul couldn't see where he was going as he was escorted out of kryta.
* **Disorientation.** Saul was displaced from his comfort zone by a riding distance of three weeks.
* **Diet.** Saul ate roots and berries as he wandered through the Maguuma.

Of these circumstances, the last may be the most important. Doubtless, the White Mantle could identify their members proficient in mesmerism; they could place a blindfold over their eyes and escort them into the jungle; yet they could never unearth the roots and berries Saul consumed. That is not to say that they didn't try. Ulrich wrote in his journal that his party's cook was reluctant to serve rabbit, sticking instead to potato preparation; so there were at least a few White Mantle who realized that Saul's diet - herbivorous - was as instructive as any other detail of his conversion. These roots and berries likely contributed to Saul's delirium, an ecstatic state in which he was able to use his altered vision and enhanced hearing to focus his minds' eye. Nose bleeds and headaches are all very well and good, but stemming the one and soothing the other is an indulgence if those who suffer them enjoy a zoophagous regimen. Their end, in the worst circumstances, is echoed by [Bright Shore's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bright_Shore). This polar kodan is a metaphor for the effect that meat-eating has on True Sight. The appetites of the flesh, should they be fulfilled by the shedding of blood, offend the spirits - especially those that call the Hall of Heroes home - so much that they curse a soul, denying them entry to the hall and, in extreme cases, transforming them into undead liches like Palawa Joko.

.

**Conclusion**

*""The Margonites are a dead race. We do not have children. We do not change from the old ways. My people are as stagnant as a fetid pond. My only consolation is the thought that soon there will be no Margonites left to plague the world.""* [\- The Lost.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Lost)

Margonite civilization collapsed and with it, in a way, the Gift of True Sight. Yet there is hope. Kormir is poised to reach the Golden City at the end of the Golden Path. Her footsteps are guided by whispers in the inky blackness of the Realm of Torment. To her detractors, Kormir's departure from her Sanctum proves that she is an illegitimate goddess, soon to be usurped. To the faithful, the Exodus is an expression of chaos magic, a lie at the center of which sits a kernel of truth that only she can find, for that is the power conferred to her. Kormir will return, receive new eyes, and reunite the pantheon. Never let go of this dream, Tyrian. Farewell."

I’m not sure when it aired because they may have played repeat episodes but I remember it being claymation and there were two clay people. I’m pretty sure they had googly eyes. This would’ve aired on a mainstream kids channel on Sky (Nickolodeon/Jr, Boomerang, Cartoon Network or Cbbc/Cbeebies.) I don’t have much memory of the show (hence why I have so little information on it) I’m also pretty sure that the name of the show was the names of the two characters. Don’t quote me on the name of the show because I’m not entirely sure. The style of claymation wasn’t like shows like Shaun the Sheep, etc. The two characters were basically blobs with arms and legs. Almost like golems. I was born in 2006 and I probably watched it when I was pretty young, so I would say in the 2000’s was when it was made. I would say the earliest it could be would be the 90s, depending on if the episodes I saw were repeats or not."

# 😵 OpenAI disbands AGI Readiness team

OpenAI is reportedly dissolving its AGI Readiness team, marking the latest in a series of major division changes as senior advisor Miles Brundage departs the company and voices concerns about the industry’s safety direction.

* Brundage announced his departure alongside a lengthy [blog post](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.BKH0F2yLXfXXfZz4rVL6MCBbWnowkcnQs6upyd5tHLpQLKaHEZTx_9jH4p5xzsPUfa2rZnYug8RYgzRAgY_hld7eVLirO6g0EbYMk2zcLceDSHfDp4ZBAzcaH3KdWmwlzZLdDAcMxh_aKAKpTzOtQu3gtaNi9QdeLJsrL3oJCgQRJlzv_j6F5fSp9Szb45AKtXGLwHKDni6OMiPBHnq2oxZ5LFgmxLOd8X2IIiBaQqemlg6soRYCdAGYjxn46bk8v5qQ486OkIOUqf5NX4Rq-yPQ94LnnKJapKRX3EvrVrQ/4aw/0n_NYpbAQRa0axR8A_Zigg/h13/h001.KGl4w0lrkEbBI1fPsgTEQrCAoIpB7GY8N6yLL4PQoY4) about his role, future, and the industry at large.
* He said that both OpenAI, other labs, and the world in general are not ready to handle increasingly powerful AI systems.
* Brundage noted that part of the AGI Readiness team will be moving under new Chief Economist Ronnie Chatterji, with the rest distributed across other teams.
* The move follows May's disbanding of the Superalignment team focused on AI control systems, coinciding with prominent safety researchers' exit.

For a company that claims to emphasize AI safety, the continued tension, disbanding, and departure of its safety-focused teams certainly sends very mixed signals. But if Brundage’s post is any indication, it's not just OpenAI that is unprepared for what is to come — it’s the entire world.

* The anticipated update enables features like expand, crop, repaint, and modify for both Midjourney-created and uploaded images using natural prompting.
* The new editor also works with Midjourney’s previous features like personalization, style references, and more.
* A new re-texturing tool allows users to change aspects like lighting, texture, materials, and more while maintaining the original shape of the image.
* Access is initially limited to yearly subscribers, 12-month members, and users with 10,000+ generations for testing before a broader roll-out.

If you were already concerned about discerning between AI and ‘real’ photos, things are about to get *a lot* more difficult. This new editor brings massive capabilities and use cases for creatives – but also unlocks a powerful deepfake and manipulation tool that makes nearly every image need to be questioned going forward.

The Greater Will's mistake and the Original Sin (Fruit),EldenRingLoreTalk,1gbi4xz,2024-10-24 20:51:13,67,0.89,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1gbi4xz/the_greater_wills_mistake_and_the_original_sin/,Scum_Mage_Infa,,"The Erdtree is the correction to the fault in the design of the One Great (The Greater Will's mistake as mentioned by Hyetta). It ensured that what was borrowed, was returned. I'll explain.

My theory is as follows:

The Greater Will originally established itself in the lands between via the One Great (A network of trees and roots all connected to each other, as per root resin item description which established a relationship between all trees and the greattree network) which regulated power in the lands between. What is power? Souls (The currency of life and death)

[People would die, be burned away, and guided back to the roots \(Tibia Marina and Deathbirds, who are a pair \[See both in Charos Grave\]\).](https://preview.redd.it/xmegwjn9uswd1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=b238822fed5d84269b0dbef70f3db1b11df9ae58)

But there was something different about this system- And that is the thing we see on reliefs on trees everywhere, but hear absolutely nothing about- And likely the reason everyone was so big and strong back in the day. (See Giant Crusher Item description)

Something even less mentioned than the fabled crucible, which appears to be a hidden secret / technique (Like nuclear technology being hidden from other countries)- The secrets that could bring about the end of an Era. And in this case- It was the fruit of the Original Tree, The Tree of Life (The predecessor to the erdtree).

I believe trees- or a large tree- or a tree of life even, existed before the erdtree and were important to the denizens of TLB. Proof? Well, we have images of special trees before the erdtree was even a thought. We have an image of a special tree on the tablet of FELLDEN John (See video at bottom for that, too much to go into here), and on the backs of the large circle objects in the ancient dynastic ruins, and on the top of the obelisks- And this one especially is very important, because it is enveloped with these vines, which we also see enveloping this tree of life from Farum Azula, bursting with life from a melting pot of life. And we also see this exact same imagry and vines engulfing the lamprey like creature from the reliefs in Farum Azula, on the divine towers- Linking these 3 locations.

[Back of circle object in Ancient Dynastic Ruins \(Moghwyn\)](https://preview.redd.it/ilxt9loduswd1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e2a0e858383694370582107c940182cf28b1a0c)

If you look at the vines carefully, they are identical in the case of Divine Towers and Ancient ruins, and almost identical to Farum (Which is upside down in that image, mind you- NGL I am half and half about it being more similar the right way up lol)

There is also this tree image in Farum Azula- And this one.

https://preview.redd.it/u120ke5kuswd1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=eac47a7eac69d2e7935acfe2e84c1346c3e36825

And there is another place that shares iconography with the divine towers, farum azula, and the Ancient Dynastic ruins- Elphael. See the video below for a demonstration of all of those connections (including the EXACT same, unique vine iconography) as well as important connections between Elphael and the catacombs/hero graves- As I won't explore that here as it is too much- My main point is, there was a great tree before the erdtree, and I would wager it was a fruit producing tree- Given that so many tree images we find are accompanied by fruit- Though it is never mentioned.

[Elphael - Tree baring Fruit](https://preview.redd.it/emfpxszluswd1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=843f238c2722fff867d5b44b5d2c1c41854e394a)

[Leyndell - \\""Two trees\\"", two different leaves, two different fruit \(Knowledge and Life? See video for more information \/ theory on that\)](https://preview.redd.it/eshfnqpquswd1.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=c833e401ca941d50b333c07bb06e411b2d9bcd35)

If this fruit is anything like the erdtree sap, it would likely grant the person who imbibes it great power, vitality, and strength (like Godfrey)- Like a tarnished popping stacks of runes (Or souls, as that is what the tree sap / fruit is- Liquified souls).

I think this perhaps got out of hand when the dragons were incapacitated and the Greater Will dipped after Plasidusax lost a few heads, and the priests that managed death on behalf of the dominant forces, used their divine knowledge to manipulate the powers of life and death and usurp the greater will, becoming the giants from the sheer volume of fruit they consumed. I think this took shape in the Forge of the Giants which was used to craft essentially soul slaves- sacrificing people to the forge to create weapons (Smithscript) and technology (forge golems etc basically soul slaves who do X task forever without question- Kind of like what marika made the last fire giant), like an industrial revolution in the lands between.

And we see proof of concept in the fact that our own maiden is burned at the forge, giving it power. I think this is reinforced by the Fire prelate chiefs helm and weapon- The CRANIAL vessel, which is a candlestick and a head as the forge- The middle having candle wax (corpse wax) just as we see in the middle of the forge. That would mean the Lava has souls in it- And IMO it does, as per the living lava- Which is VERY akin to the silver tears, which are artificial lifeforms who's core is a larval tear (A blank soul), as per the similarity to the soul found in the middle of a primal glintstone, as per sellens quest.

I wonder, if the people they sacrificed to the forge- Were shaman.

**This would also make the fact the giants are impaled like the hornsent make sense.**

https://preview.redd.it/2kbo0jp5vswd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86896a09e0606eba528d4b5c75dee15d2a1d3be

This fiery ambition- the consuming of excess souls, and this industrial revolution, was depleting the One Great network, and so what was borrowed, had to be returned.

And so enter the erdtree.

The Tree of life was felled (IMO by an Astel, the one in the north, see video at bottom for full details) and the Age of the Crucible was established to undo the mistake. Symbolized by the crucible knights themselves.

The Axe, symbolozing the felling of the original tree/system.

The Stump, symbolizing the new shoots for the new era (As further shown by priest in a tree stump imagery).

The Hammer, to reforge/rebuild a new age.

The Elden Beast is described as order incarnate, I imagine it was nestled in the felled Great Tree to steer its ordered growth, into what we see today. A powerhouse that processes souls, and does not produce fruit- But sap. Which is collected by the powers that be, and given to their most loyal champions.

https://preview.redd.it/0p3p6lx6vswd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a330c61855ce85517bf7b2ea673f8a365a9e178

The power sapped from the lifeforms and descendance of lifeforms who partook of the fruit bounty through war and death, and their descendance who grew up without the bounty of this fruit, were feeble in comparison. The erdtree closed the system, thus not allowing for the distribution of power, solidifying their own power, and over the Age of the cruicble, with wars, coliseums, and erdtree burials- Returned the souls to the Great Tree Network. And so, what was borrowed, was returned.

FULL video (wherein I present innumerable reliefs and examples of motifs from important areas, including Elphael which IMO isn't as it seems)
