Hello everyone! I'm usually a wild player, but this mini-set has brought me back to climbing standard. Side note before I start, big props to team 5 for making an impactful set on the meta, it's made me enjoy the game so much more.

Archon Rogue is a tempo based combo deck based on the new Protoss cards. One mistake early builds of this deck had was going all in on the combo with cards like Gear Shift, Stick Up, Fan of Knives, Breakdance and Bounce Around. Including Void Ray and both copies of Dark Templar makes the deck much stronger though.

Your most common combo is (4) Sonya, (1) Mini Scoundrel, (1) High Templar, (0) High Templar, (0) Mini Scoundrel, (1) Cover Artist, (0) Cover Artist. This does 28 damage and costs 7 mana.

Before I get into the mulligan guide and card choices, my stats for the deck are 18-2, climbing from about 2.5k legend to 1k legend. The 2 times I lost were against a Starship Shaman and a Location Warlock. Notably, I went against DK 8 times and won all 8.

# Card Choices:

*Combo Cards:*

**1x Sonya Waterdancer**  
**2x Dark Templar**  
**2x High Templar**  
**2x Cover Artist**

Obviously don't cut Sonya or High Templars, but it's important to realize, the second Dark Templar and Cover Artist are very important. As I said before, this is a tempo based combo deck. You almost never win without some face damage. Both of these are excellent tempo plays when not in the combo, so you include 2 so you can save one for a combo as well.

*Cost Manipulation Cards:*

**2x Photon Cannon**  
**2x Shadowstep**  
**2x Sandbox Scoundrel**  
**2x Blink**  
**1x Artanis**

The main way you win against slower decks is a Sonya Combo on the Archon. Excluding some of these cards makes it very hard to do so. You need to reduce 5 mana in total to do get the Templars to 1. Most commonly this is with a 2, 3 reduction or a 1, 2, 2 reduction. Cutting Photon Cannon is possible, but it makes you very reliant on Sandbox Scoundrel to combo.

*Tempo Cards:*

**2x Void Ray**  
**2x Chrono Boost**  
**2x Preparation**  
**1x Artanis**

Charge damage is broken; abuse it. Against almost every deck, THE DEFAULT IS GOING FACE WITH ZEALOTS. Trading the zealots is almost always a misplay unless there is a huge threat like a Brood Queen or a Brittlebone Buccaneer. The only deck I would default to trading against in this meta is Zerg Hunter.

*Draw Cards:*

**2x Quick Pick**  
**2x Dubious Purchase**  
**2x Chrono Boost**

It's surprisingly easy to run out of cards in this deck. These cards are almost definitely core.

*Tech Cards:*

**2x Deafen**

This card is so crazy strong right now and is the main reason you're playing this deck. It's absolutely broken against Infestors, Spine Crawlers, Chillfallen Barons, Elizas, Banelings, Roaches, Thunderbringers or even just getting rid of Taunts. This card is definitely core right now, but if the meta is less Zerg-centric in the future, you can cut this.

# Mulligan Guide:

*Best Mulligan Targets:*  
  
**Quick Pick**  
**Photon Cannon**  
**Chrono Boost**  
**Preparation**

These are all pretty self-explanatory. Prep has been a good mulligan target in almost every rogue deck that runs big draw spells. Quick Pick basically is a big draw spell for 2 mana. Photon Cannon lets you remove a guy and let you play your first templar a turn earlier.

*Niche Keeps:*

**Void Ray** \- Against slow decks like Dungar Druid, Protoss Mage and Terran Warrior.

**Dubious Purchase** \- If you're going second and the rest of your hand is awful.  
  
**Deafen** \- No one keeps deafen for some reason even though it absolutely destroys Zerg midgame. Keep this card against Zerg.

***DON'T KEEP THESE CARDS***

**Dig for Treasure** \- If you look at data for rogue decks, this is ALWAYS a horrible mulligan win rate card (except weapon rogue obviously), but for some reason SO many people keep it. Do not keep this card. You wouldn't keep any other minion, so why would you keep this. Even if you WERE looking for another minion, just mulliganing it would be better; Having a 1 mana do nothing on turn 1 is not worth a card.

**Blink** \- Despite it seeming like a good keep, it's bad for similar reasons to Dig for Treasure. Additionally, after playing this deck for a while, you'll find that activating combo is not very easy if you don't have Prep.

# Tips:

\#1 - **Play for damage and tempo. This is not an all-in combo deck.**

That means play your templar on turn 4-5. That means Photon Cannon your opponents face if they don't have anything. That means play prep chrono boost on turn 2 over a quick pick. That means play a Void Ray on turn 3 when your opponent has nothing or Shadowstep one to increase it's stats and clear something. That means Cover Artist your opponents Dreadhound Handler/Baneling to fight for board.

\#2 - **Try to fit in your Sandbox Scoundrel as soon as possible.**

Having a mini scoundrel in hand opens up your plays so much. Sandbox Scoundrel into Void Ray is almost always the best turn 4-5 and is worth saving your coin for.

\#3 - **When you play Artanis, you should be winning in the next 1-2 turns.**

Trading with Artanis's zealots is almost always a bad play. Calculate if you can win in the next 2 turns after playing Artanis and if you can't, you should be more focused on drawing than playing him.

\#4 - **Setting up a 2 turn lethal with Dark Templar is usually a very strong play.**

Things to watch out for when doing this are: Kerrigan, Reska, Banelings, Hydralisk, Horizon's Edge, Seabreeze Chalice and Domino Effect.

\#5 - **Starting turn 7 or so, make sure you aren't missing lethal each turn.**

Lethals can be super hard to spot sometimes. If you ever have a mini scoundrel in hand, there is a good chance you can find lethal. Check before you do any other plays."

I have owned a 911 in the past, also a daily. This time around, I want a coupe (had a vert). I've driven these all but a short drive isn't really enough to gauge how these cars would be to \*daily\*. My commute is Southern California stop-and-go freeway traffic, but on the weekends I have beautiful canyons and mountains easily accessible. No plans to track. And, boo me, but I want PDK and not a manual given it's a daily and used in stop and go traffic five days a week.

  
Would love to hear from owners who potentially had more than one of these.

  
CGTS 4.0

  
Pros: 4.0, smaller, more nimble, midengine is cool

  
Cons: Old platform shows, maybe not dynamically, but the interior. It's fine, though.

  
Question mark: will it wear me out on longer road trips due to noise and vibrations? I know none of these are quiet cars, but I do intend on doing longer road trips.

  
992.1 base Carrera

  
Pros: more modern tech suite for daily use, more modern interior, this gen comes default with PASM so a well equipped base Carrera seems perfectly fine compared to prior gens where you were locked out of things

  
Cons: more modern interior has some weird stuff like the nubbin 

  
Question mark: For around $110-115k, most CPO specs are just okay, but can certainly get sport chrono/sport exhaust at least

  
991.2 Carrera S

  
Pros: will be better appointed for the price

  
Cons: don't really see how it's ""better"" than a 992 in any way other than perhaps styling

  
Question mark: I suppose not many, powertrain is similar to 992 and has modern stuff like CarPlay."
CARRIER HAS ARRIVED. -- A Heroes of Starcraft Day-1 Legend Tempo Protoss Druid Guide,hearthstone,1i7ukxn,2025-01-22 22:44:50,13,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1i7ukxn/carrier_has_arrived_a_heroes_of_starcraft_day1/,iNFlatableThor,Competitive,"***TL;DR Skip to near the end for the deck list.***

# Introduction

The main strategy of this deck is to play minions and ramp on curve to ultimately clear enough of the opponent's board so that your Carriers can finish off the enemy hero with their direct damage. Oftentimes you can soften up their hero with Charge Zealots (Chargelots) or Swipes. If the game lasts long enough, you can set up the ultimate combo of Ceaseless Expanse for cheap, or even 0 mana, plus Carrier for the full 16 face damage from the Interceptors.

**This deck surprisingly reminded me of Druid decks of the past**, playing for the board and getting hero damage in where you can while setting up for a final game-winning combo. *(Chillwind Yeti is to Chrono Boost as Force of Nature Savage Roar is to Ceaseless Carrier.)* It can highroll by drawing the right combo of ramp and payoff in the early game while also retaining value through a number of cards in the lategame. Knowing when to go face and when to trade is especially important in this deck because there is no total OTK with opponent at full health that you can go for. Lastly, I believe every card in the list serves an essential role (and they did during my climb from mid-Gold to Legend), so I would be hard-pressed right now to change anything from it. (Though this was only from Day 1 of the miniset release so it may have to adapt going forward.)

# Creating the List

I was most hyped about the Carrier card from the initial miniset card reveals. Hugely statted minion that you can't even play naturally has quite a bit of appeal to it. And if it sticks around for just one extra turn, you probably have won the game? Sign me up! Like in StarCraft, it has such a huge lategame payoff.

Initially, when putting together my first list, I wanted to not immediately resort to lists online so I tried to homebrew a bit. I noticed there weren't TOO many miniset cards and it was feasible to just jam them all into a single deck to try them out (16 cards total). Then I tried to see what would best fit into the Protoss card shell. To get the Carrier out successfully, I would need to  draw it fast enough, reduce its cost, and survive until that point. Extra taunt minions (Tortollan Traveler, Tar Creeper) didn't cut it. Extra draw minions (e.g. Acolyte of Pain, Bloodmage Thalnos) didn't cut it. Neither did trying to mix a bit of a dragon package in with the Protoss shell.

At this point, I had a better idea of how the Protoss cards themselves were performing. **Immortal was vastly underforming.** It was too slow as a single big taunt minion. And far too often, if I even played it, I wouldn't get the double stats buff anyways; or if I did, I would have to hold off on playing another important card like an immediate board removal. Immortal is like putting all your eggs in a single basket--a basket that's countered by Zerglings and Siege Tanks, just like in StarCraft. I cut both copies from my Protoss shell.

**Warp Gate was also on the decline** in my mind, and I was already starting to cut 1 copy from the list. It seemed too slow to spend 4 mana to save only 3 mana later. So you'd have to play 2 or not play a Protoss minion until the location reopened and you could trigger it a 2nd time. Turn 4 Warp Gate trigger location into Turn 6 trigger location then play a Carrier gets the Carrier into play. However, Carrier works best when the opponent has a smaller board so you can better determine what the Interceptors will hit. This kind of play also interferes with playing Artanis or Flowerchild with ramp around those turns. It's also redundant with the other cost reduction options in the deck. Like in StarCraft, rushing straight to Carriers is often not the way, and it's better as a finishing blow. In this regard, the miniset theming is even more on point!

At this point, I found a theorycrafted list online by Socrates ([LINK](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/protoss-burst-druid-starcraft-miniset/)) and got a few more ideas for the list. It had some legendaries that I didn't actually own, including some I also wasn't too keen on in the first place, so I replaced them with some other ""good"" cards. It also had 2 copies of the following (except Marin):

* **Innervate:** A more aggressive ramping option. It has worked out so well in the deck with the Protoss package. Remember the Turn 1 terror that was Coin Innervate Chillwind Yeti from Classic? Now we have Turn 1 Innervate Construct Pylons Chrono Boost to get a 3/4 Charger dealing 3 face damage and probably surviving to deal another 3 damage on the next turn. Or you can play your Artanis hero on turn 3-4 with Coin/Innervate + Pylons, leading to a huge early tempo swing and opening the possibility to get divine shield value over the next couple turns. Simply playing an Innverate to get your Carrier or other bigger minion out a whole turn earlier can be excellent. The downside is taking up a whole card slot in your deck, but the deck includes other ways of maximizing value.
* **Malfurion's Gift:** Did you know you can run 4 Swipes in a single deck? Because I almost didn't after not playing Standard for a whole year. Extra Swipes are so good against the Zerg and Terran decks that may go wide fast. It's even better that all the cheap Terran Starship tokens have only 1 HP so a Swipe can easily deal with several of them at once. Don't forget that placing the 4 damage of Swipe on face may be ideal. Malfuion's Gift also offers another chance to ramp vs. very slow decks. I had one game vs. a Weapon Rogue where a Feral Rage for armor offset the damage race just enough to come out on top. And finally, it's a cheap card that can soak the hand destruction from a Ghost.
* **Trogg Gemtosser:** I had never played with this card before. And I was highly skeptical of it when seeing it in the theorycraft list. It seemed way too hard to get good value out of it with its Finale condition. However, with some skillful play, it is incredible. Play it after reaching max mana, and even after playing New Heights, to deal a whopping 10+ spread damage, which can all go face by the way if the opponent has an empty board. It just fits into the overall goal of the deck: win the board and drop your finisher for immediate damage. It's like a mini Carrier in a sense. Remember that you can play it sooner for tempo and that you don't have to save both for huge late-game damage. Also very importantly, *temporary* mana crystals will not count towards Trogg's damage.
* **Summer Flowerchild:** At first, the Finale condition was a bit of a turnoff for playing 2 in the deck. But you don't actually need to play it with the Finale to draw, only to reduce the cost of the cards drawn. Though if you manage to play it with Finale, it's like playing 2 more Innervates. Speaking of which, playing The Coin or Innervate or New Heights to precisely ramp are great to perform the Finale. New Heights on 3 mana into Flowerchild into drawing Artanis or Marin to play the following turns have been powerful curves.
* **Marin the Manager:** A FANTASTIC value generator and a decent body to play at reduced cost. Just don't throw by picking the Goblet as your first treasure and drawing a hand full of Chrono Boosts! 🙃 Some sneaky Terran Ghosts may have a mission to steal your treasure, so hold an extra 0-, 1-, or 2-cost spell in hand if you can't play your treasure immediately!

# The List

Notes about a few more key cards in the list:

* **Void Ray:** A 0-mana 5/3 Rush Divine Shield minion is great, but playing it as a 3/1 for 1, 2, or even the base 3 mana may be the correct play for the tempo.
* **Mind Control Tech:** Literally a tech card that depends on the meta, MCT shores up a weakness of the deck, which is ultra wide boards. Medium-sized boards (3 or less minions) can be dealt with rush/charge minions (Void Rays/Zealots) or Swipes. If a board is bigger, Carrier or Trogg won't as reliably kill those minions on the board.
* **Gorgonzormu:** Excellent value and decent tempo as a 3/3. Turn 1 double Innervate cheese dragon is another crazy highroll to look for in your mulligan and can lead to huge tempo with a fast cheese played for three 4- or 5-mana minions. Use the cheese to set up Finales. Typically, play it earlier, rather than later, for mid-sized minions for tempo rather than the biggest possible minions. And watch out for cheese-hating Ghosts who may try to snipe your cheese, so you may want to play it earlier than intended to dodge that.
* **Bob the Bartender:** Super versatile card that seems to do everything. Good to remove huge single targets and freeze the board. In my climb to Legend though, I think I used the freeze option as often as yoinking a minion. With starship decks like the Terrans trying to make many smaller starships rather than one gigantic one, ""Recruit a Minion"" loses some value. And for the first time ever, I did choose the ""Refresh the Tavern"" option once in order to spend exactly 3 mana overall by playing Bob and then perform a game-winning Trogg Finale!
* **Zilliax Deluxe 3000 (Unkilliax):** More removal and sustain. You know 'em, you love/hate 'em.
* **Star Grazer:** One more huge, hard-to-remove taunt minion. The hero attack buff works as another finishing burst option, and the armor provides additional sustain. It synergizes well with the many cheap spells in the deck. (You may even use a Malfurion's Gift and not use the temporary spell in order to get the +8 attack/armor.) It synergizes well with Artanis's divine shield hero power to help remove huge minions with your hero's attack if needed.
* **Swipe:** Remember when this card cost 4 mana?

# Conclusion/Going Forward

Out of each of the Protoss card classes, I don't think Druid is the worst, but it's definitely a different style of deck. I think Mage is a little more on the control side, while Priest is more geared towards value, while Druid is the most tempo-oriented of the three. I like it personally because you can just snowball early with 3/4 Chargelots and maintain a winning board and potentially win before even dropping your first Carrier. But ultimately, it depends a bit more on the specific lists for each class. I found this list a blast to play on Day 1 of the Heroes of Starcraft mini-set while most other players were also playing StarCraft-themed decks. However, it's true competitiveness will have to be seen when people start playing some of the older Standard decks again."

However, I was promptly met with what you see in the image. A whopping 3220 was needed and it looks like I've completed the pass and haven't started it at the same time. I was hoping I could get some tech support issue fixed but it was only computer messages.

Lore of the Cards - StarCraft Cards So Far,hearthstone,1i25cw6,2025-01-15 14:20:23,179,0.97,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1i25cw6/lore_of_the_cards_starcraft_cards_so_far/,Subsourian,Fluff,"Hey all!

A while back I did some lore threads on each race for beginners, so before the cards become TOO overwhelming I wanna make good on my promise to do a tiny dive into the lore of each card since I know a lot of folks have never touched StarCraft. It’s a fun setting, and I HIGHLY recommend checking it out, mostly because SC1 and the first SCII expansion are free!

I may update with card reveals from today but I expect I’ll do a separate thread for all the other reveals, since this thread is already… long.

I did a (not so short) summary of each race here for [terran]( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1gv5ftx/starcraft_lore_for_newbies_the_terrans/), [protoss]( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1h0j7mb/starcraft_lore_for_newbies_the_protoss/), and [zerg]( https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1gxeaqh/starcraft_lore_for_newbies_the_zerg/). So check them out to get up to speed! I’ll separate these out by race:

######**TERRAN**

**[Hero - Jim Raynor]( https://i.imgur.com/r63nwtj.png):** See the terran story thread for a longer dive on him. Jim Raynor lived a storied life, from a farmboy, to a soldier, to an outlaw, to a marshal and father, to a revolutionary. Jim Raynor stood alongside the rebel Arcturus Mengsk in taking down the corrupt Terran Confederacy, only for Arcturus to create his own tyranny in the Terran Dominion. Raynor’s the everyman, a lawman trying to stand up for the little guy in a universe rolling over them. He wrestles with guilt over allowing Arcturus Mengsk to come into power, and for him not stopping his lover Sarah Kerrigan from falling to the zerg and becoming infested after Mengsk betrayed her.

Jim’s battlecry to relaunch starships comes from his battlecruiser, the *Hyperion*, for which the first SCII expansion Wings of Liberty is named. Jim’s modified the ship to within an inch of its life and will often pull off daring maneuvers and rescues with it. The Signature Art appears to be of the *Hyperion*, or at least a ship of the same class (Behemoth-class battlecruiser).

**[Ability – Stimpack](https://i.imgur.com/jDM6rQ1.png)**: Stimpacks are a lethal concoction of synthetic adrenalin and endorphins mixed with aggression amplifiers that are given to terran soldiers on the frontline to keep them focused and aggressive in combat, even against horrific odds. However, these stimulants are both addictive and cause a list of horrible side effects, usually reserved for troops deemed expendable. It’s a funny one for Jim because Raynor’s known to not approve of stimpack use, with the Mar Sara Militia not utilizing it as much (also why in Heroes of the Storm he has “inspire” instead of stim) BUT he lets his soldiers use it in both SC1 and SCII so given he’s giving it to his troops, it fits ok I guess.

* **[SCV](https://i.imgur.com/DDVHaXa.png)** - The T-280 Space Construction Vehicle is the old standby support mech of terran bases, large mechs that can construct prefabricated structures, repair terran armor and weapons, and mine resources. Initially made to create the Confederacy’s space platforms, the SCV has become a standard for civilian prospecting operations and military construction. Its card ability to lower starship cost is likely in reference to its ability to repair terran ships such as battlecruisers.

* **[Marine](https://i.imgur.com/ss673mu.png)** - The standard frontline soldier of militaries, militias and revolutionaries of the sector, marines are outfitted in CMC armor with Nuclear/Chemical/Biological shielding, with a powerful C-14 Gauss Impaler Rifle capable of firing 8 mm spikes. They are the flexible backbone of the sector’s infantry.

* **[Ghost](https://i.imgur.com/NdVElbC.png)** - Back on Earth in the 22nd century, genetic manipulation led to the unlocking of the psionic potential to humanity. Though those who showed this potential were genocided on Earth, the descendants of those with modifications were sent to the Koprulu Sector, and the Terran Confederacy (later the Dominion) would forcibly recruit those that showed potential into their Ghost Program. Ghosts are psionic assassins and supersoldiers, usually armed with a C-10 canister rifle, sent on black ops and intelligence operations. Until recently they were kept in check by neural inhibitors and regular use of memory wipes to ensure their loyalty. Ghosts are usually equipped with cloaking, variant rounds such as Lockdown and EMP, and the famous ability to call down a tactical nuclear strike. The ability to “snipe” the lowest cost card of the opponent is likely a reference to their snipe and assassination abilities.

* **[Hellion]( https://i.imgur.com/aEmePyg.png)/[Hellbat]( https://i.imgur.com/6CZnXa1.png)** - Fast attack ambushers of the terrans, the hellion is a flexible raider utilizing an infernal flamethrower, famed for its ability to run on any combustible fuel, including whisky. A recent invention allows hellions to shift their armor forward and flamethrower into a shorter cone, turning into the mech known as the hellbat. I have no clue why it buffs allies or why the hellbat form gives rush.

* **[Siege Tank](https://i.imgur.com/JqBiDOI.png)** - The Crucio Siege Tank is an upgrade over the SC1 Arclite, though largely has the same function, single target damage with its 80mm twin plasma cannons in its tank mode, and the ability to root itself in “siege mode” to hit enemies at long range with its deadly 180mm Shock Cannon. This mode makes it key to the terran ability to secure a defensive line against all comers.

* **[Lock On](https://i.imgur.com/rEzQUaD.png)** - Lock on is an ability of the Cyclone, a mobile missile platform that is able to fire as it moves. Lock On is a sophisticated targeting system which keeps the Cyclone focused on one target as it unleashes a missile barrage. The Cyclone was previously a remote-controlled drone, but the unpredictability of a human pilot caused the design to be shifted to have a human pilot.

* **[Starport](https://i.imgur.com/pdLfXmx.png)** - This structure is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the terran space fleets and air forces, allowing them to produce air support on the battlefield. The starport formerly was supported by a control tower addon for advanced ships, but this has been replaced with more streamlined tech labs and reactor addons. I’ll put the starship pieces it summons in one go:

 * **[Viking](https://i.imgur.com/fKr8Cqk.png)** - The A-2 Armored Mechanical Hybrid is a core terran fightercraft with devastating Lanzer Torpedos, with the unique ability to transform into a ground walker and support infantry with deadly Gattling Guns. I have no clue why it gives armor.

 * **[Liberator](https://i.imgur.com/fKr8Cqk.png)** - A recent invention of the Terran Dominion, the liberator is based off the advanced Valkyrie craft of the United Earth Directorate (the government of Earth that tried to invade the sector). It has a powerful fighter mode, but can activate its “defender mode,” becoming immobile but attacking any ground unit in its zone of control with a deadly Concord Cannon.

 * **[Banshee](https://i.imgur.com/fKr8Cqk.png)** - The AH/G24 Banshee is a deadly atmospheric stealth bomber designed to sneak up on enemy positions, taking the stealth niche formerly occupied by the Wraith. It has the latest advancements in stealth technology, so much so that the Dominion would send teams to downed banshees to recapture or destroy its stealth drive as to not have it fall into enemy hands (it did anyway).

 * **[Medivac](https://i.imgur.com/fKr8Cqk.png)** - A fusion of the old terran dropship and UED medic nanotechnology, the medivac is able to transport ground units to the front or quickly evacuate injured units, with afterburners allowing additional survivability. The ship uses advanced nanites to heal infantry from a distance, keeping soldiers up on the frontlines, though the lowest-bidder tech involved is mistrusted by marines. 

 * **[Raven](https://i.imgur.com/fKr8Cqk.png)** - Automated support drones, the ravens manipulate the battlefield with their onboard nano factories, capable of constructing a variety of tools such as auto turrets, seeker missiles, anti-armor missiles and point defense drones.

* **[Battlecruiser]( https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/PK324NYVKT6O1736288660530.png)** - The titanic battlecruiser is the heart of the terran fleet, outfitted with a variety of laser batteries, hanger bays, and a powerful Yamato Cannon that fires a magnetically contained nuclear blast. The battlecruiser in the default card is the Minotaur-class, which you use in SCII multiplayer by default. The [Signature Art version]( https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/835ZOEQZ34481736288660540.png) is the Behemoth-class, which is what the *Hyperion* of Wings of Liberty is, but also the class used in the first StarCraft.

* **[Missile Pod](https://i.imgur.com/uWJ5CfT.png)** - In spite of its design it is NOT a missile turret, the automated (though often manned) defensive turrets used to defend terran outposts. The ATVX Missile Pods are an upgrade for battlecruisers that allows for them to barrage an area with a swath of anti-air missiles. A variant of this design appears on the mighty Gorgon Battlecruiser, which is equipped with lethal H23 Missile Launchers.

* **[Lift Off](https://i.imgur.com/EfU1E6b.png)** - Terran military technology takes much of its roots in advancements made in the mining and prospecting sector, lucrative trades in the resource-rich Koprulu Sector. As such, buildings are designed to me mobile and modular, capable of lifting off to move to a new source of resources to exploit. Many military structures have implemented similar technologies, though most require addons that are left behind when the core structure moves.

* **[Ultra-Capacitor](https://i.imgur.com/6CZnXa1.png)** - This technology was created by Jim Raynor’s scientist Egon Stetmann in the Second Great War in researching protoss energy storage, reducing the reload and recharge time of weapon systems.

* **[Salvage the Bunker](https://i.imgur.com/0Cpy01P.png)** - Bunkers are prefabricated neosteel structures which are simple to deploy via SCV, and give marines cover from enemy fire. Because of its simple design, bunkers can be salvaged to return a portion of their cost, giving terran forces flexibility in moving their defensive lines. The starship cost reduction is likely a reference to the resources regained.

######**PROTOSS**

**[Artanis](https://i.imgur.com/QmVPFbO.png):** A student of the protoss hero Tassadar, Artanis was thrust into leadership during the fall of the Khalai’s homeworld of Aiur, and saw the reunification between the Khalai refugees and their formerly exiled kin, the Nerazim. Artanis took over as leader of the Daelaam, the unified protoss, and oversaw the reclamation of Aiur, albeit at great cost as he was forced to cut the Khalai’s psionic gestalt, the Khala, to stop the crusade of the god-like being Amon.

**[Ability – Twin Blades](https://i.imgur.com/oFsRlSk.png)** - The twin blades of Artanis, also known as the Twilight Blades, are one psi blade that Artanis traditionally uses, and the warp blade used by his old friend Dark Prelate Zeratul, who died freeing Artanis from the control of the fallen xel’naga Amon. He carries both these blades in memory of his old friend and as a sign of the unified Khalai and Nerazim. The name Twin Blades comes from one of his buff abilities in Heroes of the Storm to increase the damage of these blades.

* **[Zealot](https://i.imgur.com/fZOMG7M.png)** - The frontline soldiers of the Khalai’s Templar Caste, the zealot is armed with dual psi blades that channel the user’s mental energy and emotions into a tangible blade. They are supported by powerful plasma shields that allow them to take fire from enemies, and are outfitted with cybernetic grafts to increase their movement speed. Zealots can also briefly turn their body into raw energy, giving them a burst of extreme speed to “charge” at their enemies

*  **[Dark Templar](https://i.imgur.com/vY99kfO.png)** – The dark templar, also known as the Nerazim, were a culture of protoss who rejected the psionic gestalt of the Khala, and were sent into exile and persecuted for their refusal to join. Using the teachings of the protoss hero Adun, the dark templar draw on the energy of the cosmic void, and can cloak themselves in shadow. Their ability is a reference to their role as assassins who strike only at an opportune time (and at your mineral line if you don’t have detection).

* **[High Templar](https://i.imgur.com/B90yAuO.png)** – Those Templar warriors of the protoss who reach a deeper understanding of the Khala and predispose themselves to psionic combat are allowed to walk the path of the High Templar. These warriors use their powerful psionics to support their fellow warriors, able to manipulate the battlefield by manipulating energies. Their iconic ability is the powerful psionic storm, a ripple of mental energy which shreds the minds of those caught in its wake and destabilizes machines and armor, which is why they have that AoE battlecry.

* **[Archon](https://i.imgur.com/cKArLAz.png)** - In a powerful last stand, two templar can merge into an archon, the ultimate expression of protoss psionics, a being of raw psionic energy. The process destroys the bodies of two Templar, and is a temporary being that burns out. But the result is a being that sends powerful psionic shockwaves that devastates biological enemies. Normally, two High Templar make an archon, and two Dark Templar make a Dark Archon, though in SCII that was scrapped (along with a HT + DT making a Twilight Archon). Maybe we’ll get dark archon stuff with priest. Somehow Hearthstone has made its power level closer to their lore than any interpretation in StarCraft’s gameplay.

* **[Blink](https://i.imgur.com/ZgJxSVs.png):** Powerful Nerazim walkers named stalkers are able to use void displacer to “blink” across spaces, allowing them to maneuver around enemy positions. This gives the stalker deadly ambush abilities.

* **[Immortal](https://i.imgur.com/RyF1ojV.png)** - Before the fall of their homeworld, injured protoss could volunteer to be placed in walkers named dragoons to continue fighting even after taking mortal wounds. However, the technology to recreate the stasis pods that sustained injured warriors was lost with the protoss homeworld of Aiur. In order to preserve the remaining dragoons, all were upgraded into immortals, powerful walkers with two phase disruptor cannons, and advanced shielding technology. Even after Aiur’s reclamation, immortals remain a powerful frontline walker for the protoss.

* **[Colossus](https://i.imgur.com/iNQ9fzc.png)** - The mighty colossus was the only protoss automaton class completely designed for combat. It used dual thermal lances to incarnate large groups of enemies in a line. The colossi were sealed away when their deployment against a race named the Kalathi led to the near-genocide of that species, but when the zerg took Aiur, the protoss saw the need to revive their forbidden weapons of war. As people have pointed out, the art on this colossus is wrong, the energy beams come from the side of the walker (not the front) and should be red. It’s important because that’s how they get the sweeping motion and they’re THERMAL lances.

* **[Void Ray](https://i.imgur.com/rtcoj2j.png)** - After the protoss homeworld of Aiur fell, the two disperate cultures of the Khalai and Nerazim cam together to stand against the zerg. One of the technologies the two cultures created together was the void ray, which combines Khalai energies with the deadly Void used by the Nerazim. The void ray fires a constant prismatic beam that allows it to melt armor and heavy carapaces alike. A prismatic core channels the Khalai energies while a Nerazim mystic named a “void lens” manipulates Void energies, an often-deadly process as the beam’s intensity is increased. 

* **[Carrier](https://i.imgur.com/S5raDyW.png)** - The core of the Khalai’s Great Fleet, the carrier is the central hub of any invasion force. Its microfactories are able to deploy swaths of interceptors to overwhelm targets, and it serves as a hub for ships and ground forces in a protoss invasion. In spite of the constant insistence in lore sources they have no other weapons, carriers are often outfitted with purifier beams capable of liquifying a planet’s crust after a sustained bombardment. Which, you know… kinda should count as a weapon.

 * **[Interceptor](https://i.imgur.com/ynX5izn.png)** - Powerful automated drones, interceptors swarm enemies of the protoss and strafe them with powerful plasma cannons. Interceptors are deployed in flights of 4-8, but are controlled by the carrier, and if the carrier is destroyed, the interceptors will cease functioning.

* **[Resonance Coil](https://i.imgur.com/z6HWb56.png)** - Tempests are long-range capital ships that generate spheres of immense power using a kinetic matrix. Resonance coil is its configuration against ground targets, which can be upgraded with tectonic destabilizers to ravage stationary buildings.  

* **[Warp Gate](https://i.imgur.com/ljnWYgo.png)** - Protoss utilize a structure named the gateway to teleport troops between bases, outposts and colonies. A recent invention however was made reverse engineering the warp gates left behind by the progenitors of the protoss, the xel’naga. This invention allows protoss gateways to transform into warp gates, allowing them to warp in reinforcements wherever they maintain a power field instead of to static gateways.

* **[Chrono Boost]( https://i.imgur.com/KlMMTRG.png)** - The nexus is the heart of a protoss base, a powerful khaydarin crystal connects a base to a fond of energy named the psionic matrix that radiates from their homeworld of Aiur. This powers all the structures of a protoss base, extended by pylons. The power of this crystal can also be used to manipulate time and space, such as utilizing a “chrono boost,” which creates a pocket of distorted time. In game, this allows units and research from a single structure to temporarily build faster.

* **[Photon Cannon](https://i.imgur.com/dMHEevc.png)** - Defensive emplacements of protoss outposts, photon cannons fire antimatter spheres encased in photons to ward off attackers. They are reliant on the power of a nearby pylon however, and without power the photon cannons like all structures become inert.

* **[Shield Battery](https://i.imgur.com/cHPphy5.png)** - Protoss utilize powerful plasma shields to sustain their warriors, which recharge over time. But to speed their recharge, batteries using large khaydarin crystals build up energy, and can recharge nearby units and structures with weakened shields.

* **[Construct Pylons](https://i.imgur.com/H44CbE9.png)** - Pylons are large shards of khaydarin crystal teleported to extend the range of the psionic matrix from a nexus point. This allows protoss to warp in further forces and structures, and provides power to a protoss base. The name is a play on the common alert when a protoss player is “supply blocked” (can’t build any more units) “You must construct additional pylons.”

######**ZERG**

(not much zerg so far, so next thread will have much more on them)

* **[Zergling](https://i.imgur.com/2icfJlL.png)** - Assimilated from the Dune Runners of Zz’gash, the zerglings are brutal swarming hounds of war for the Swarm. Their metabolic and adrenal processes can be modified to increase their speed and lethality in combat. Though weak individually, they can overwhelm enemy positions with ease. Their battlecry is a reference to the fact their genetics are so simple, two spawn from a single zerg larva at a time.

* **[Hydralisk]( https://i.imgur.com/0tZ1dbH.png)** - Assimilated from the “caterpillar cow” slothien, the hydralisk is now a canny deadly killer. While it can engage in melee, it is most known for its lethal needle spines, which can be launched using an array of 4000 muscles. These spikes are poisonous and can pierce armor with ease.

* **[Viper](https://i.redd.it/ui0t76tan1de1.jpeg)** - technically leaked I guess but public enough anyway. The viper was created from the genetics of the primal zerg, zerg that avoided assimilation into their Overmind's hive mind and grew independent of the Swarm. It utilizes genetics of the defunct defiler strain, and is a vicious support flier capable of abducting enemies with its prehensile regurgitated organs, and lay down blinding clouds of microbes that reduce range, launch deadly parasitic bombs that damage all air units around them, and consume friendly structures to regenerate its microbe arsenal. Its ability appears to be based off abduct (which pulls and stuns an enemy), though I assume reborn is just to fit with the DK fantasy.

* **[Spawning Pool](https://i.imgur.com/gZKGWUH.png)** - The spawning pool is a structure of the zerg hive cluster that gestates the base genetic material of zergling and queen strains, sending it back to the central hatchery in order to unlock their genome in the larva. A side note the art of this card is… weird. Zerg structures require creep to be sustained, and this spawning poll seems to only have the smallest bit of creep on the sides.


--------------------------------

I’ll probably do more if there’s interest, but hopefully this gets at least some of you a brief overview since I know a lot of people haven’t been exposed much to StarCraft. Happy to answer any questions about the setting!"

Echelon Comp 20+ Ammo Review by an average shooter,SpringfieldArmory,1hyrfjb,2025-01-11 03:16:50,22,0.97,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringfieldArmory/comments/1hyrfjb/echelon_comp_20_ammo_review_by_an_average_shooter/,drakehunter70,,"TLDR; There is none, this is a long in-depth article for people who enjoy reading a shooters thoughts on this pistol Just look at the pics if you have a short attention span.

[Over 20 ammos tested with the Echelon Comp](https://preview.redd.it/yadexds8nace1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d45114f0332bbccf28fed0d958349aa609a7097)

The Echelon was the last firearm I aquired last year - on Dec 31st, so I've only had time to put about 502 rounds through it, but I've got enough experience with it that I think it's safe to share my thoughts on why I like it and how reliable it has been.

Of all the ammo I've tested, I only had 1 round of Norma MHP White Box 85gr choke on one round. However, I was speed shooting steel so it's quite possible I limp wristed one as I was talking while shooting. As such, you can say this pistol will shoot pretty much anything despite having an integrated compensator.

The shot below was one of 200 rounds shot while speed shooting steel at night using the factory sights - which are excellent. It ran like a champ, but if I'm honest I can't say that the recoil was any different than some of my other better guns like my CZ Shadow 2 or Canik Rival.

[Shooting at night makes for great pictures, but the flash didn't bother me a bit](https://preview.redd.it/dbriqup2pace1.jpg?width=2364&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4466fa244584df42315e23bb42b2d7c2dfc0e462)

The obnoxious flash comes from the Norma Monolithic Hollow Point (MHP) White Box ammo that has the ammo with the most flash I've ever seen. The Igman I shot that evening wasn't nearly as obnoxious, but pictures make it seem worse than it actually was.

Today I did bullseye shooting with a bunch of ammos and it did great. I personally had some issues on a few, but I was using the same grip and point of aim (unsupported at 10 yards) for every one:

[Ammo Test Group Size Results](https://preview.redd.it/yeqzr8vfobce1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=468e355926c394ef573e473773f58c9c8bf06cad)

**UPDATED: Jan 18, 2025**

I was able to get muzzle velocities for some of the ammos today:

[Muzzle Velocity, Energy & Std Dev from a Garmin Xero](https://preview.redd.it/6r5nhwiorade1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9525c1126f899be428fb7e0229ac2be3ddcc75c)

**Findings**

Blazer, American Gunner & S&B 124gr all had tiny groups ruined by a flyer, but MaxxTech would win the day (repeated with 2 additional groups tested). That shocked me as I just purchased my first box for this test!

[5 shots each from 10 yards unsupported \(1st 12 ammos\)](https://preview.redd.it/t4ytwzxtqace1.jpg?width=851&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b27e6809b39ab3f15e33af65132166668b7b8f8f)

All shots were taken using a green open reflex optic as shown in the ammo picture at the top of this article.

[5 shots each from 10 yards unsupported \(2nd set of 8 ammos with 10 for MaxxTech at the end\)](https://preview.redd.it/f410cjp8qace1.jpg?width=1429&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=241e713e7de50911ef0c46916597b83aed551539)

The barrel was dirty from the factory so the groups I had been getting weren't very good, so I did a deep clean prior to the bullseye shots and it  paid off. With a few exceptions, I was staying in the black circles (just under 3 inches). That said, I did start to get tired so groups like the one from the S&B 124gr show that when I do my part I can stack them in the bullseye with the right ammo, but the traction on the grip leaves me for wanting more so I generally start slipping after the third shot. Some Talon grips are definitely in my future on this pistol.

Shockingly the MaxxTech did amazing so I have two groups shown here and a third not pictured that did very well too. Hornady Critical Defense 115gr impressed me as well, but the Critical Duty really let me down.

The biggest win for the day was the Apex Xtreme Defense which looks like Underwood, but performed better than both. Given the fact that it can be purchased for nearly a dollar less per round, I think my underwood days might be done. That said, one interesting note about the Apex ammo is that its head stamp sure looks a lot like MaxxTech:

[Apex & MaxxTech sure have similar looking head stamps](https://preview.redd.it/pxp6conspbce1.jpg?width=2155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed8113171921346f835abfb70f32771fdb194b69)

One of the worst performers was Eley Minor 9 - which is historically my best ammo, so I ended up doing a re-shoot of it. The result paid off as shown here:

[2nd 5 shot group with Eley Minor 9 124gr](https://preview.redd.it/xw8cs0eh6bce1.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec6b788c0c97e7c58fbe1acabe87b509a7e3fe01)

Now a good test would probably shoot a box of 5 round shots of each of the ammos tested here, but I don't have the time or funding for that, so I generally used my gut to decide what felt like a solid group and what needed another chance. To that end, I shot the Hornady Critical Duty 135gr again:

[Group #2 of the Hornady Critical Duty 135gr still didn't match Critical Defense 115gr](https://preview.redd.it/ofuwnqg37bce1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3ca18f92f5eb64f090ea74b458df9d390ae33c)

The first 2 were near the bullseye, so it was definitely me. The last three went high, so I think my grip was slipping or perhaps the dusk light and fog was getting the better of me. Whatever it was, it seems capable of better than what I shot. For good measure, I did one more 5 shot group at an adjacent target:

[5 Shot group #3 of Crit Duty 135gr](https://preview.redd.it/xueeh3sj8bce1.png?width=109&format=png&auto=webp&s=69316f80ca0e60762e11fbefa067e1f2262cf38d)

It's a bad picture, but I was still pulling to the right and splitting the group. Remember, I'm always aiming dead center so it's clear this ammo pulls right compared to the other ammo tested.

**Ammo Test Conclusion**

[20 of the ammo's tested for bullseye shooting](https://preview.redd.it/e3l724e4abce1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=441d64ebd16a64b76669a8fd26092e97f376d797)

I'm impressed that the Echelon Comp ran every ammo without issue. NONE of my other guns - even my Glock, H&K, Walther, Beretta and more couldn't handle all of these ammos. Generally the Staccato and Norma MHP White Box (not shown above) will jam just about any gun. Nosler can be difficult for some as well.

This debunks the Internet rumors have you believe that you can only shoot certain types of ammo in a gun with a compensator. That's definitely not true in this case.

**Chrono Data**

I don't own a Garmin Xero, but I've used one many times. Sadly I didn't have it today. I definitely could have used it here as I think that would have been great to have that extra data point.

**Thoughts on the Echelon Compensator Design**

[The compensator cuts the slide and barrel](https://preview.redd.it/pgt4y5xyabce1.jpg?width=1678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b9f0f1418617c0f9a349f087fe9fd164340a7b9)

What's nice about this gun is that the barrel and slide are cut much like you'd see with a chunk port or equivalent. However, unlike some products which cut the rifling, this design has the rifling stop just before the cut as shown here:

[Borescope look at the comp inside the barrel where the rifling ends just before the cut](https://preview.redd.it/qy17bv7mbbce1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=564b7f69011c3e2a7e998e492abf45da3a169a2f)

This is a great design as you effectively get a protected crown and no twist degredation caused by cutting the rifling. Bravo Springfield for doing it right! The ammo tests prove this design is the way to go for bullseye accuracy too.

Here's a better look from the outside of the cuts in the barrel and slide:

[This is how every comp should be done](https://preview.redd.it/1fngjxa2cbce1.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ac0667ded9758687722cf1b0af634c98a038def)

**First Impressions of the Eschelon Comp**

[Eschelon Comp](https://preview.redd.it/t50rngffcbce1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c45acb43fbb6a4577245f1737ab18113e4b045e6)

Like many of you reading this, I had seen a lot of hype about the regular Eschelon but I resisted the temptation to buy one. While I was interested, I didn't need another gun that didn't do anything diffrent from what I already owned.

When the comp model was announced, I couldn't help myself and ended up ordering one. I can say that even though it's only been 500 rounds and 10 days of ownership, I'm glad I bought this gun. It runs  as reliably as my Glock G34 Gen 5 MOS or H&K VP9 Match, but has a ton of great features.

**Yes, the hype is real about the slide design**

The slide is fantastic - especially the H&K like wings on the back, and the front serations will make PDP fans love it. The gas pedal is a nice touch, but its sublte - which is great for holsters and those who hate an obnoxious pedal. It's perfect for me, but if you like the ridiculous gas pedals people put on P320's then you'll want more than this.

**Good Duty Trigger**

The trigger is a duty trigger that gets the job done. If you look at my collection, you'd see that I have a lot of great triggers so this one isn't anything for me to write home about. It doesn't suck, but honestly I'd stack rank it as better than only the M9A4 and P320's in my collection. That said, this is marketed as a duty gun so I think it's an appropriate trigger. It's also good enough to still make reasonable groups. At speed I did find myself getting trigger freeze on it more than any other gun, so this is the one place where I'd say it's just average.

**Iron Sights - Great for Duty, not Precision**

The iron sights feature the rear u notch which for me is great for going fast and sight acquisition, but garbage for precision shooting. The front sight is perfection and on par with Sig's X-Ray sights that I love so much. I just wish they didn't have a U notch rear.

**Slide Stop Perfection**

One of the complaints I've heard on the Internet from some whiny guntubers is that the slide stop is too tiny. Personally, I think this is the best slide stop on any gun ever made - full stop - PERIOD. Why? Because I have a 1911/2011 grip where I ride my thumb close to the slide, so I rarely get slide lock on any gun that doesn't have a 1911/2011 style safety to ride. However, on this one I get slide lock 99% of the time. What's more, it's super easy to hit it when I need it. I don't know what the complaints were about, but this thing is plenty big and super easy to release for a right handed shooter like me. However, it worked just as easy when I ran it one handed with my left hand. I've never seen ANY slide stop work as easily as this one on both the left and right side.

**Birthday Bump - Woohoo**

One thing I really love about this gun is that if you ram the mag in you'll activate the slide release so the slide goes forward to chamber the round - just like my Glock does (aka The Birthday Bump). This is a feature I wish every gun had. However, if I don't ram it really hard then it doesn't do it. This means it's basically built for people who both love that feature and those who hate it - brilliant.

**Central Operating Group (COG) System**

I own four P320's, a P365 and I've tested the newest Beretta APX. I'd say the removal of the COG is much harder than the P320 but easier than the others I've tested. Over time I'll probably get used to it, but it's not nearly as simple and as intuitive as the P320 FCU design.

**VIS Optics Cut**

I like the design, but I'm not certain the front boss pins are as snug as I'd like. Time will tell how good this system really is, but what I can say is that it's nice to have a slide mount optic without a plate. Co-witnessing the irons was super easy even with a higher than average optics base.

**Finish Durability**

[After 310 rounds the top of the barrel was already showing excessive wear](https://preview.redd.it/myv0o4isgbce1.jpg?width=1062&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db000ecd5c85976c3a3dad40d972550054dd2894)

Springfield needs to talk to Canik about what barrel finish to use (e.g., nitride) as the this seems to be a weak cerecote that doesn't hold up at all. Really - 310 rounds ad it's already wearing out? Fortunately the slide and grip module are much more durable, BUT I haven't run it in a holster yet.

**Shooting Fast & Grips**

The lure of a comp gun is the the ability to shoot flatter and get tighter groups at speed. I can say that at my max speed I was able to consistently stay in a 4"" group in the A zone which is impressive for me. Shooting fast on steel plates the transitions were great as this is a light gun, and the return to zero meant that I never lost my front sight. However, the lack of traction on the grip causes me to shift the gun to the left or right so the groups are always offset (and I eventually start missing steel plates).

I wouldn't replace the grip module because I love the features, but I'll definitely order some Talon grips to keep the gun from swimming in my hands when I run it fast (or bullseye shoot super hot ammo too slow).

I also am on the fence about the backstrap. I ran it with the medium when shooting steel with irons and thought I needed more, so I did the large for the bullseye shooting. I don't think it helped, and might have made it worse. As a result, I may go back to the medium. Fortunately they are super easy to swap when you know the trick (stick your finger inside the magwell and push to release).

For reference I wear size Large gloves.

**Everything Else**

The mag release, takedown, magwell, etc... were all great for me.

**Conclusion**

[The Hype Is Real](https://preview.redd.it/81xgqp4hibce1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3605228a3e5d9e8323fa07c60d7a15521a1edf40)

I paid for this myself and get nothing out of you loving or hating this gun. However, I think the less than $600 price I paid for this one online makes it as big of a steal as my Canik Rival and CZ P10 F. It's the gun that Glock should have done themselves - years ago, and is everything you want in a duty and home defense pistol.

My only real gripe is that is that it doesn't get me as excited to pull it out of the safe as many of the other guns in my collection, but it's got nearly every checkbox of what's needed in my dream gun.

**More Info**

I did video all of the shots taken for the ammo test and I did some poor quality video of shooting it at night. If people are interested then let me know and I'll consider posting them on a diffrent social media platform that I enjoy more than Reddit.

Long Post but Some ideas for the game,TheTowerGame,1hxobhf,2025-01-09 16:51:52,33,0.92,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTowerGame/comments/1hxobhf/long_post_but_some_ideas_for_the_game/,kodemastor,,"First off the recent updates have all been amazing so major shoutout to the dev team yall are fantastic.

With that said here are some ideas I have that I think could make for some good additions.

1: Run stat history: This is the biggest one for me I cant lie. Being able to see your stats for past runs on each tier would be a god send. I want (NEED) to look through my progress and see what the difference my upgrades or changes to my build makes.

2: Bot + UW Cooldown Sliders: Another huge one for me - UW respec is talked about all the time but doesnt seem to be coming anytime soon. With Syncing all sorts of abilities and such being such a big focus in the game it would be great to be able to adjust the cooldowns with a slider just like the one used for the range lab.

This has many justifications. If you are using Multiverse Nexus you want the minimum cooldown possible and syncing doesnt matter. With a slider I can have uneven cooldowns and equip MN and resync them if I take it off. This would also be great for the bot cooldown labs as it is crappy to start a lab and end up desyncing a bot for X amount of time. Slider would allow you to put time into the lab while keeping the cooldown the same. 

3: Auto Lab Boost: This game is slowly becoming an actual idle game with free ups, auto abilities ,free gem stacking, auto labs it would be nice to also have the auto boost. 

4: Build Diversity: I feel like there is a constant back and fourth where dmg gets buffed and now health sucks, health gets buffed now damage sucks. It would be nice to see more defined build paths.(See 5 & 7)

5: New mods: I have seen a few people ask for a new mod slot which I am not super keen on because I dont even have the current mods maxed. However, should this be something that is added I think it would be cool to add some mods that work similar to the trade-off perks. A mod that reduces some of your health for damage or visa versa.

6: Module Presets: I use certain modules for farming and certain modules for tournaments. It doesnt cost anything to move the levels from one to another so why not be able to to make presets which swap the mods and move all the levels over.

7: WS expansion: We are already seeing players with LTC in the Q's not sure if anyone has hit sextillion yet but we are going to (if not already) see players with a fully maxed out WS. So some new upgrades could be cool. This could also be another way to add the Build Diversity mentioned earlier where maybe the next attack upgrade has 2 options and you can only buy 1/2 options. I feel like with the Tech Tree allowing for free respecs and for presets this would make sense.

8: Stat Breakdowns: It would be nice to be able to click on my damage and see a Base\*lab\*enhancement + etc. All in one place this would help greatly with a lot of the ""why did X upgrade make a Y change confusion""

9: Notifications: Simple phone notifications for new events, weekly missions, tournaments, labs.

10: Nuke and ILM suck: I dont know what to say about these except that I think any ILM changes should be purely damage focused. Each UW should be unique, they dont all need to be damage and utility and I think ILM should be a slow precise very high damage UW.

Honorable mentions: 

Sub effects for skins: only applicable with the skin equipped. Again, would add build diversity. Could also lead to skins with different rarities.

UW skins: While its a bit of an oxymoron, a purple GT would be dope. Or like a chrono field that is all icey.

New Enemies: Dont really have any ideas for new enemies but I do know it would be cool.

Death wave health bar: Just like the wall but for your death wave.

Guilds: Has been mentioned a million times but guild events where much like a tourney, you play a round and each boss you kill in the round does X health to the ""main boss health bar"" or awards some sort or points/progress for a goal the whole guild is working towards.

Thats all for now. I know its a super long post but I hope somebody up there sees this and considers one or a few of these or takes some inspirations. Let me know if anyone else has any ideas they are always cool to read."

\#74 - **Eternal Threads** - *PC* - 6/10 (Decent)

Eternal Threads markets itself as a ""first-person, story driven puzzle game about time manipulation."" Its marketing artwork features someone in a futuristic suit with the tagline ""Alter the past to save the future,"" and the game's setting when you open it features you as that suited individual in some kind of facility being walked through how to use your chrono-doohickey out in the field before you're warped through time. Now, before you read any further, I'd like you to take in those descriptions, close your eyes, and spend a good several seconds envisioning the kind of video game experience you might now expect to have. Go on, take your time. Really paint that mental picture. When you've got it locked in, jump to the next paragraph and let's see how close you got. I'll give you some space.

Hey, welcome back. So, what did you come up with? Was it something along the lines of ""You're trapped in a small English town home where you walk repeatedly from room to room just watching a bunch of college kids sort out their drama?"" If you did, bully for you, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that a holographic soap opera probably wasn't what you had in mind. Rest assured, you're not alone on that front! Naturally, the revelation that this game was really just a melodramatically window-dressed visual novel about mundane people came as quite the disappointment, but I stuck with it through the early stages because I wanted to see the time travel aspect in action. The gist is that six people live in this house and all six died because of small changes to the timeline, which you've got to fix in order to save them. In practice this means watching the past week of their lives scene by scene to discover what happened in the *current* timeline so you can decide which events to alter in order to reorient events and save their lives. It seems to be predicated on the idea that each person has moments of 50/50 decisions where they could truly go either way, and it's in these moments you're able to somehow nudge them towards one or the other option, which then has potentially substantial ripple effects down the line.

When I started out I was routinely prompted to change a decision to alter the future, but since I hadn't seen that future yet it didn't make any sense to muck with it. This meant that it was *hours* before I felt like I had enough information to take any agency, and of course changing one decision would just mean walking around to view even more scenes. So again: if you're coming here for a cool puzzle game, you need to get the heck out of dodge. Truth be told, I didn't even *like* the people I was tasked with saving! Though they were written and performed quite believably, I couldn't envision myself connecting with any of them, and their stories continually drifted into places where I didn't want to follow.

But ultimately that's also what saved the game for me. Have you ever watched a show/film or read a book where all the problems could've been avoided if the characters just freakin' *talked* to one another? Have you ever gotten so frustrated you yell out ""JUST TELL HIM!"" or something like that? The beauty of Eternal Threads is that it's a game that makes you watch these same kinds of agonizing moments and actually allows you to say ""Just talk to him,"" and then the people do in fact communicate, and things do in fact change. Maybe not always for the better, and the choices the game defines as producing the best outcomes are often not ones I'd advocate for personally, but that's the point: life is messy. I didn't *like* the tenants of this house per se, but in the end I *did* care about them and want to see them survive. It's hard to in good conscience recommend a game that so brazenly tries to bait and switch consumers into thinking they're getting a brilliant puzzle adventure instead of just another arthouse style drama consisting of hours of dialogue and little else. But if you're actually *interested* in an arthouse drama with loads of dialogue, well, Eternal Threads is surprisingly engaging and competent.

&#x200B;

\#75 - **LEGO City Undercover** - *PS4* - 7.5/10 (Solid)

Similar to the last couple titles in the franchise, I found myself initially captivated by this one at the outset, especially because objects I'd destroy would no longer burst into studs (currency), but rather collectible ""bricks"". I spent about an hour in the opening area gleefully destroying everything around me trying to farm these things, figuring I'd be off to a great head start whenever I found out what they actually did. And of course, like anything you do in a Lego game before you're explicitly told to, this was a huge waste of time. Indeed, LEGO City Undercover suffered the same typical pitfall of every other game before it: you've got to play through a bunch of scripted missions filled with collectibles that you are unable to get until you've already beaten the game. And just as with each previous franchise iteration since the mid-2000s, I *hate* this idea enough that it makes me actively disinterested in playing. So, just as with the past couple titles, I hit a point where I told myself I'd seen enough, and made the conscious decision to rush the main quest to the exclusion of everything else.

Turns out there was a problem with that: the titular Lego City was too dang engaging to let me ignore it. Missions in this game are initiated by traveling to their start points in the open world at the right time, but you can indeed go anywhere you want at any point you're *not* in one of these fifteen set missions. Further, a lot of story content happens outside the missions altogether, directly in the open world, forcing you to immerse yourself a bit in it, during which time you'll naturally spot points of interest or collectibles you'll want to circle back to, like satisfying ""super build"" spots where you can use all those newfangled bricks you've been collecting. Yes, much of the stuff you'll find is still locked behind story progression, but *this* kind of gating I didn't mind at all. ""Come back later with a new upgrade to discover this secret"" is a *much* stronger hook to me than ""Play the entire game a second time to get stuff you no longer need."" And so every time I turned on the game with the goal of beelining some content, I'd find myself wandering around collecting random stuff despite knowing I was never going to actually 100% this game. Which meant that I wasn't doing it out of any sense of obligation, but because it was genuinely *fun*. I'd missed that in this series for a very long time.

Now all that said, there's a reason some people call this ""baby's first GTA,"" and there are also reasons I don't like the GTA series. One of those is that I just really don't like urban areas in general (even in real life), so an urban open world doesn't hold a ton of appeal to me in itself. Another is that I'm not interested in driving. A third is that I don't like committing crimes or playing ""bad"" characters. LEGO City Undercover gets around this third point by having your character be an undercover cop, but the other points still hold, putting a bit of a ceiling on how much I was going to be able to love this game. There are technical issues too, like destroyed objects leaving invisible collision boxes behind to impede your movement, but never of the game-breaking variety I've sadly come to expect from the series, so that's something. All in all, the biggest praise I can give this game is that it's been weeks now and I haven't actually uninstalled it yet. It's taken on a second life of sorts as a time-wasting game to play with my kids, who love the idea of running around looking for secrets. So, who knows? Maybe that 100% completion rating isn't quite as far away as it seems.

&#x200B;

\#76 - **The Spirit and the Mouse** - *PC* - 6.5/10 (Tantalizing)

The lasting impression I think I'll have from this game is the music, in large part because it was also the first meaningful impression I had. You play as the kind-hearted mouse of the game's title, wandering a small town in the French countryside during a thunderstorm, wishing you could help people out. The music immediately captured me during this segment: not only was it well produced and thematically appropriate, but it also engages you dynamically, hearkening back to classic Looney Tunes era type stuff with an orchestral score matching the on-screen antics. A blind person could play through the opening of this game - which features no spoken dialogue - and get a pretty good sense of its attitude. Very strong showing. Anyway, one bold but misguided attempt at helping out a townsperson results in near disaster for the mouse, but triggers a meeting with the titular spirit as well, a being of pure electricity. He gives you electrical powers, and you then set off to start fixing the town's problems in earnest.

The Spirit and the Mouse plays out then as an adventure game, going around the city and doing errands, and often errands-within-errands. This doesn't feel *terribly* like work for a couple reasons. First, since you're a mouse the game's perspective is unusual. You're always looking up at things, and the game does a great job of making you feel small but never helpless, so just walking around the neighborhoods is more interesting visually than it might otherwise be. Second, the streets of the town feature a large number of metallic objects, which you can shock to collect the game's electrical currency, and of light bulbs, the all-important optional collectible that gives you a reason to truly explore. I had much more of a blast just going into a new section of the village, zapping and collecting everything I could, than I did with the (admittedly clever at times) pseudo-puzzles that the game's actual quests presented.

Of course, it's not perfect. The camera frequently locked the viewpoint on an angle it was sure you would need, creating moments of heavy frustration when you did not in fact need that angle. I used zapped items as a marker for where I had and hadn't explored, only to find later that they start glowing again as soon as you reload the area. Most disappointing, the game's ending is pretty badly fumbled: concluding an otherwise splendidly paced little game is a monotonous heavy backtracking quest that grinds everything to a halt in service of a different payoff than the one you actually want. And then I also didn't care for the narrative ending after that, so the whole affair left me with a bit of a ""That's it?"" kind of aftertaste. But if I push those feelings aside what I'm left with is a lovely, brief, cozy little romp with great musical scoring. You could do a lot worse for four hours than that.

\#77 - **Pokémon Trading Card Game** - *GBC* - 7/10 (Good)

I had a problem. My kids have a whole bunch of Pokémon cards, but no interest in learning or playing the actual Pokémon TCG. I didn't have any way to gain practice with the format or with deck building, but the itch was there. Thankfully, Hudson Soft on behalf of Nintendo/Creatures Inc/Game Freak/The Pokémon Company had me covered 24 years ago with this Game Boy Color entry. It's a bit weird going back to an era where there were solely the original 151 pokes to worry about, and the actual TCG of today is a bit deeper than this earliest incarnation, but the core gameplay is all the same. Having spent more time with it, it's safe to say that the Pokémon TCG game is far from perfect, and I wouldn't ever want to pour money into the hobby in order to play competitively, but it's still a pretty good time at its core. There's a strong sense of satisfaction that comes from hitting the right draw or denying your opponent's winning play, and to that extent my prevailing strategy in *this* game was just ""get Dragonair on board and spam Hyper Beam,"" which removes energy from opponents, often rendering them helpless. Good times.

Now, don't get me wrong. This game *is* just an ad to get people to go buy Pokémon cards (the ending even explicitly tells you to do this), and as such there wasn't a ton of effort put into anything beyond the card duel system itself. Gameplay between matches consists entirely of walking up to people to ask for matches or the odd card trade, or otherwise just building decks. This in itself is a big problem because the game won't allow you to use a given card in multiple deck slots. Once a card is in a deck it ""locks"" to that deck, so for example if you make a lightning deck and toss all your lightning energy in it, then want a fire deck with a few lightning cards to cover your water weakness, you won't have any lightning energy available because it's all stuck in that first deck. In practice this means that your ""four deck slots"" are really just ""one"" that you have to constantly modify in order to make sure you have access to all your cards, and that's some grade A horse donkey. So no, Pokémon Trading Card Game is not a terribly good video game experience, strictly speaking. But it *is* a fun and easy way to play a nice digital version of the card game itself, and that's good enough for me.

**Turok: Dinosaur Hunter** - *N64* - Abandoned

Turok features possibly the worst control scheme I've ever experienced. Putting myself in the N64 controller frame of mind, it maps the analog stick to camera movement, and all actual player movement to the C buttons. I trust you already agree that this is terrible. Nobody's giving GoldenEye 007 or Perfect Dark any awards these days for control schemes, but at least you freaking moved with the stick, you know? Perhaps anticipating this problem, Turok helpfully offers you an option to change your handedness. Should you claim to be left handed, the game will simply trade the movement functions from the C buttons to the D-pad. This does on an N64 controller at least get your right hand on the camera, but of course I wasn't playing on an N64 controller: I was playing on a Switch, where the C buttons are mapped to the right analog stick, meaning by default the sticks were reversed from what you'd expect, and switching handedness made the game completely unplayable. Ultimately I did come up with a solution: go into the Switch settings and reverse the joysticks at the hardware level. Finally, I could play Turok with something resembling a modern control scheme and get into the meat of the game.

Wait, no, not yet. The sensitivity is all out of whack and my joy-cons are drifting, so I'm constantly fighting the camera anyway. But hey, I've got some contact cleaner, let's clear this dust out and get things stable, and NOW we can play, and oh no this game is actually raptor turds, isn't it? You're punished for picking up ammo via additional enemy spawns. There's an absurd focus on platforming when movement is both way too fast and way too stiff. It has a checkpoint system but also lives, and killed enemies don't respawn when you die, so the only purpose of the checkpoints is to make you walk back each time until you get the ""back to main menu"" game over screen. The environments all look the same: just a bland, washed out jungle. Nothing interesting happens in this game, and yet I suffered through it anyway until I hit the first actual boss fight about a third of the way through, where I had to fight a jeep. It was, of course, immune to my shotgun, so I had to use all my ammo for other weapons destroying it, at which point a second jeep emerged. Somehow grinding that out as well, I got to the third phase of the boss, a dude who kills you in three hits (assuming you didn't get hit by either jeep, which of course you did).

I hated almost every moment of playing this game, and was glad that this miserable boss fight gave me an excuse to quit at last.

\#78 - **Kirby's Dream Course** - *SNES* - 7/10 (Good)

In 1992 longtime Nintendo partner HAL Laboratory was working on a minigolf game for the Super Nintendo called Special Tee Shot when an upstart designer of theirs named Masahiro Sakurai put out a little Game Boy game called Kirby's Dream Land. The huge success of that game led HAL to abandon some of its other projects in order to capitalize on Kirby's newfound brand success, releasing Kirby's Adventure for the NES the next year and a pinball spinoff for the Game Boy after that. But then they looped back to Special Tee Shot and thought, ""Say, what if we just replaced all these sprites with Kirby stuff?"" And so we get this bizarre creation: a Kirby minigolf game in which Kirby himself is the ball and his rogues' gallery serves as the obstacles.

But even calling it a minigolf game feels weird. Is it a sports title? A puzzle game? I genuinely don't know. Taking place on a fairly open isometric grid, the idea behind each hole of Kirby's Dream Course is that Kirby must launch himself into every enemy in the area. These enemies are animated in place but don't move around or anything, and once only one enemy remains it will drop to the ground and transform itself into the target hole. Thus, rather than each stage being a linear test of skill and timing like minigolf often is, Kirby's Dream Course places a much heavier focus on planning your route, because the hole is ultimately wherever you decide it's going to be. Now sure, there are ledges, spikes, bunkers, water hazards, bounce pads, bumper walls, and of course the bottomless pit surrounding the edge of the stage as well to serve as hazards, and these will often inform a sensible route forward. But you have way more agency in Kirby's Dream Course than any other golf-adjacent game I can think of. On top of that, despite the seemingly bolt-on branding, this still manages to function like a Kirby game. Enemies you collide with grant you their power, which you can use as your shot is traveling to trigger various effects. All of this adds up to gameplay that's much more interesting than it feels like it probably should be.

Which isn't to say that Kirby's Dream Course is a perfect or even necessarily a great game. It suffers from the same issues of visual ambiguity as all isometric ""3D"" games of the 16-bit era did, where you hit an obstacle it looks like you should clear or take the wrong angle because it looked like the one you meant to take, and those problems inevitably create frustration. Your shots are also limited, albeit in a novel way: each shot burns energy, and running out of energy costs you a life, but each enemy defeated or hole completed restores one energy. This makes the game surprisingly forgiving at times, as you might be on your last legs only to nail a great shot that knocks out multiple enemies and restores all your energy in one go. Likewise, losing a life simply causes you to respawn where you are with full energy again, so that's generous too. However, the messaging is inconsistent. Yes, you can make up for some bad shots, but other ones will instantly kill you, or place you in a virtually unrecoverable situation because dying removes your active power-up, which can at times be necessary to complete a hole. There's also a final boss fight - in a minigolf game - that's all about timing rather than any of the careful planning skill you've been developing all game, so that feels like a big miss too. But overall it's a game that's unique, charming, and not too demanding, and that makes it a pleasant handheld holiday palate cleanser.

**Dicey Dungeons** - *PC* - Abandoned

I was eager to try this one because it's a roguelike by the guy who made VVVVVV, which I really liked, and I'd heard some good things about its design ideas. Those things ended up being true, in that after your initial run through the titular dungeon you unlock a new class that plays completely differently. This continues on each success, and each class then has additional variations you can play through. 

Well, I say *can* play through, but I really mean *must* play though: Dicey Dungeons has 36 ""episodes"" (6 for each of the 6 classes) and *all* of them need to be completed in order to reach the end. That's a lot of repetition through the game's somewhat limited enemy content, so it relies on constant reinvention to keep you engaged. That means if you begin to struggle with a certain setup you're doomed to repeat it until you succeed. For me that was the fifth class, the Witch. I had no issue with any of the previous ones, but with the Witch I found the game suddenly too luck reliant and the mid-game too punishing. 

I realized after my third straight failed attempt - where I felt like I was doing everything right and was just the victim of bad RNG yet again - that while I constantly thought in previous runs ""Oh, this is interesting"" or even ""Oh, this is clever,"" I never once had the thought, ""Oh, this is *fun*.”

\#79 - **The Surge 2** - *PS4* - 7/10 (Good)

The two things that jumped out at me about the first game are still here in even stronger form: smart, player-friendly level design and tight, interesting combat. The former of these is important because The Surge games are Soulslikes, which means lots of risk in exploring. Here that risk is significantly mitigated by a few factors. For one, if you have tech scrap (xp/currency) you can't spend to level, you can bank it at the med bay (bonfire) and venture out with a clean zero, safe as can be. For two, the game constantly surprises you with new shortcuts back to previous safe havens, constantly making your travels more efficient. For three, to mitigate the fact that the previous two elements combine to make The Surge games arguably easier than other Soulslikes, you actually earn more tech scrap the more you're carrying, directly encouraging you to take more risks. It's a really cool balance they manage to strike, giving the player the choice of how dangerously they want to play.

On the combat front, everything in The Surge games revolves around targeting and cutting body parts. This is how you get new gear and materials to upgrade existing gear: if you want a piece of arm armor, chop a guy's arm off! This means in these games you don't simply target lock an enemy but actually target lock the specific part of the enemy you're trying to damage, and indicators on screen let you know how much damage you still need to sever the piece. I feel like this combat got a bit deeper in The Surge 2, with more weapon types, different movesets even within weapon types, hidden combos to try with different effects, etc. No, I may not have *needed* yet another Mk. III leg coil but was that going to stop me from slicing off that dude's leg? I think not. On top of that, there's greater enemy variety and interest this time around too, keeping the combat crisp and engaging all the way from beginning to end.

Sadly, while these two elements are at the core of the experience and they're better than the previous time around, I think all the secondary bits are universally a step down in The Surge 2. The world is bigger but more bloated, with lots of load screens, interactive shortcuts that act as environmental eyesores, and a general urban decay feel that I've never cared for. This extends to the side quests too, of which there are many, because you're in a big city and NPCs are plentiful, which detracts from the strong solitary atmosphere the first game evoked. Finally, the story follows the bad ending from the first game, a trope that I generally hate, and suffers for it by being a grimdark broodfest featuring over-the-top, comic book villainy, as opposed to the deeper philosophical meditation I think they were trying for. So The Surge 2 isn't a bad game by any means, and if you're just a pure gameplay kind of person, I'd argue it's hard to go wrong with this. But I can't help but feel that they tried to soar a little too close to the sun here, and ended up backsliding from a truly excellent game into a merely good one.

\#80 - **Where's Waldo?** - *NES* - 1.5/10 (Awful)

You know the books, and you might even think (as I do) that they're pretty good fun. Let me tell you something: hunting for 5 pt. Comic Sans Waldo on an 8-bit canvas is not going to scratch that itch. The very concept is doomed by the limitations of the hardware right from the outset. Nevertheless, curiosity is a thing that's real, so in I went, and one thing was quickly made clear: Where's Waldo on NES wants to take your frikkin' soul. Sure, it's packaged like a family game with a positive brand identity, but this game is absolutely ruthless at peak NES-BS levels. Once you choose your difficulty level (I played through on Medium, which affects things like timer allowances), the game starts playing transitional music while it shows you some Waldo art alongside a countdown. After a few seconds of waiting you'll startle to realize the game has already begun, and *you are losing*. Yes, Where's Waldo operates on a timer that spans the full breadth of game: hit zero at any point along the way and it's back to the title screen for you. Advancing past this first bold reality check, you see Waldo lazily traveling on an overworld map screen, eventually arriving at his first destination, where the game loads a randomized image and tasks you with finding him. You will immediately peep the clock and realize that time passed even on the unskippable overworld screen, so you're now even more in the hole, and haven't even had a chance to start playing yet. In fact, between levels Waldo will often take as many as 50 seconds off your starting \~11:30 timer. That's a big chunk!

But now we're finally into the gameplay, and as I said: a bit of a disaster. On any given level Waldo may well be semi-recognizable in his trademark wool cap, red and white striped shirt, and blue jeans. Or he may be distorted at an angle that makes him impossible to positively ID. Or he may even completely change his color scheme, frequently to one that makes him blend into the background directly. In each level you will see a lot of people that *could* be Waldo, and you're never quite sure, and if you move the finnicky, hyperactive cursor to them and guess wrong, you're docked a seemingly random number of seconds between 20 and 60. Only when you guess right are you treated to another lovely walking vignette during which time inexorably passes, reminding you that failure is completely inevitable. To hammer this point home, after the first couple levels Waldo wanders into a cave, where the game changes into flashlight tag: Waldo is running around a pitch black screen at remarkably high speeds and you've got to tag him with a cursor click to make him stop. When you do, you're rewarded with a choice between a level exit or a level exit with a time bonus. Naturally, you want that time bonus. Naturally, it's a trap: it's got a 50% chance of docking you a minute instead. Gambling!

Eventually with enough perseverance and pattern recognition you can start to more reliably pick out Waldo from the crowd, which means you'll more reliably get to the Subway, where the game again changes forms. Here you've got to follow a winding set of paths, rotating hex tiles as you go, in order to collect Waldo and his lost glasses before making your way to the exit. A pleasant diversion in itself, and so when you see Waldo's good friend The Wizard Whitebeard show up, you pop over his way too to see what's what. At which point he kills you instantly. OK, so avoid Waldo's best friend at all costs, makes total sense! You get back there, you're taking care to avoid him, but oh yeah *he's a wizard* and he'll simply teleport around the map, often right on top you, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it but pray you don't eat the ol' Dimension Door -> Power Word: Kill nuke combo the next go-round.

If you do make it past Deathbeard and somehow still have time on the clock after one more normal level, then you get to play a slot machine minigame for all the marbles. I mean, it's Where's Waldo, why wouldn't it be that, right? ""You kids gamblin' yet?!"" Match three Waldos before your remaining time drains and you win, except you have to move to and lock in each slot manually using your suddenly lethargic cursor, the three slot columns move at different speeds and thus require different timings, and if you get even one wrong you have to lock the others, move back to the reset button, and try again *with a new slot pattern*.

It took a whole bunch more attempts than I was hoping but I eventually emerged from this utter fart gauntlet and sent Waldo to the moon, where I was greeted with a picture of him looking around as if to say, ""That's it?"" and then was unceremoniously dumped back to the title screen. Thus, though the game is indeed ""Nintendo hard,"" there is somehow still no glory whatsoever to be found in Where's Waldo for NES. Perhaps someone at developer Bethesda (lol) should've stepped up during the pitch meeting and gone full Drax on the room, for it is not ""*Where* is Waldo?"" that we ought ask ourselves, but rather ""*Why* is Waldo?"" And I must confess that I cannot find a reason.

\#81 - **Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!** - *NES* - 8.5/10 (Excellent)

Let's get the formalities out of the way: Punch-Out is the OG boss rush game and a shining feat of early game design. It's all about pattern recognition, speedy reactions, hidden clues, and practice practice practice. Arguably the first in the ""git gud"" genre, it's tremendous, and the only reasons I didn't rate it even higher are that you're never happy to see a repeat opponent (even though the fights themselves change) and the need to have to fight through the entire circuit again should you fail is a bit of old school tedium that doesn't hold up too well years later. Speaking of not holding up all that well decades into the future: man, those Japanese devs sure were a bit racist, weren't they? It's largely in good fun (the most egregiously racist caricature is the Japanese boxer, after all), and the characters themselves are so full of personality that you largely let it slide, but I'd be remiss not to say something.

Anyway, you probably already know all that, so this isn't a post about Punch-Out. This is a post about fighting Mike Tyson in Punch-Out. As a wee lad with limited access to the neighbor's NES, I recall my elation when I first lucked my way into clearing the Minor Circuit, then being annihilated repeatedly by Great Tiger because nobody ever told me that I had the ability to block. These were cherished memories, and so many years later I set upon a quest to fulfill my childhood dream by actually beating Punch-Out. I diligently worked my way through every circuit, learning the ins and outs of all the fights, grinding for hours until I could do it all, at last unlocking the password to the Tyson fight itself. One more bout for all the glory. And of course, I ate Tyson's bootheel so thoroughly, so hopelessly, that I considered the whole endeavor lost...until now. Two days ago I made a New Year's ""Presolution"": I would defeat Mike Tyson and conquer my white whale before 2024 wrapped up. I didn't think this would be much trouble. I was quite mistaken.

Mike Tyson, you see, spends the first 90 seconds of the fight chucking uppercuts that instantly drop you. Worse, beyond the first couple punches (which have a sort of predictable rhythm to them) every subsequent ""dynamite punch"" can either be launched instantly, or with a slight hesitation, or after a longer pause. This means it's impossible to actually anticipate the punches, and you must instead react to the literal split second flash of his body with a speed dodge move. Every time. Or you die. Y'all, I'm not a young man anymore. I don't have those kinds of reaction speeds. So it was that hours of my life disappeared to the whims of Mike Tyson's Dynamite Punch, burying me before I could even really begin to fight. Occasionally though I'd find a groove, or catch a wave of luck, and spot daylight on the other side of the barrage. Then, when I finally broke through and made it to the second round, I realized I had a problem. Tyson *is still* an actual Punch-Out fight; he's just gatekept behind this heinous WarioWare minigame. It took such immense focus for me to get through that first phase that I had no mental energy left to learn the ""real"" fight. So I saved at Round 2, and I practiced. And practiced some more. And practiced until I was actually able to TKO The Dynamite Kid, which felt incredible.

I had just over two hours left until 2025.

Now knowing that there was hope left in the universe, I went back to the start of the fight to string it all together. Half an hour went by. Another. I got within an inch of a true TKO but flubbed a counter and ate the canvas for a ten count. Another half hour, most of it just eating uppercuts, when at last a run materialized. It was imperfect and unsatisfying as I kept taking hits and missing opportunities, yet by the late third round I'd put Tyson on the mat four separate times and I realized I was a few seconds away from going the distance. One more dodge, the bell rang, and referee Mario gave his decision: Winner - Mac. I had about 25 minutes to spare, and it was done. 5 year old me now thinks I am the coolest grown-up on the planet. This was for you, little dude. Dreams do come true.

**Coming in January:**

* A new year brings a fresh start...or it would if I didn't have a couple games already in flight. One of those is **Dave the Diver**, a game I never saw a ton of personal appeal in, but you see enough positive reviews that you eventually think you're not giving the game a fair shake. So far, well. I need to unlock more mechanics to reach a fully-formed opinion, so I'm maintaining an open mind. ^([but I think I was right])
* On the other hand you have games that you see other people say ""No, this isn't all that good"" but you feel like ""Well maybe I'm a better target audience than they are,"" and then you play **Mega Man Battle Network** because you're deciding to trust your gut, and tragedy strikes when you find out this time everyone else was indeed correct.
* So that's a couple bits of unamused indifference, yeah? 2024's last sickly gasp of breath before we truly reset with some new stuff that should hopefully land a bit better. And it's with that sense of optimism that I'm looking forward to finally experiencing **Vampire Survivors**, a game I've heard only good things about that also tickles my interest in all the right places. Will the stars align at last?
* And more...

Future campaign ideas - spoilers from what if season 3.,MarvelStrikeForce,1hood3t,2024-12-28 23:44:46,10,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/1hood3t/future_campaign_ideas_spoilers_from_what_if/,pukhalapuka,Discussion,"These ideas came after watching the latest what if season 3. Just some idea to maybe make some fun contents and game modes. Just to have fun.

  
1. MCU Original character - Byrdie the Duck origins

But make it start from when Howard and Darcie were on the run. Have them, and ice loki fight off waves of enemies trying to protect their egg. Will be easy - medium ish difficulty. Have it like a strategy that you need to use and you can get thru it. Oh yeah the background music is Kiss i was made to love you. Thats the most important part.

  
2. Variants from the what if episodes. I think gun slingging kate bishop is cool.

  
3. **""Battle of the Watchers""**

* Inspired by The Watcher's role in ""What If?"" Season 1.
* A PvE mode where players assist The Watcher in fending off multiverse threats.
* The Watcher occasionally intervenes with buffs or debuffs that impact both players and enemies, making the battles unpredictable.
* Unique twist: Players are forced to pick teams from alternate versions of characters (e.g., Captain Carter instead of Captain America).

  
4. **""Thor's Cosmic Party Crash""**

* Based on Party Thor’s episode.
* A survival mode where your team prevents escalating chaos at Thor’s party by battling out-of-control guests (villains like Loki, Frost Giants, or even Ego).
* Buffs come from ""party vibes"" generated by characters with humorous or ""celebration"" traits (like Star-Lord, Deadpool, or even Rocket).

  
5. **""Multiverse Mayhem: Variant Showdown""**

* A boss rush mode featuring ""What If?"" variants of key characters.
* Example bosses: Supreme Strange (mirror clones), Infinity Ultron (summons multiversal bots), or Gun-Slinging Kate Bishop (high DPS traps).
* Reward: Collect special multiversal gear to enhance existing characters with alternate-themed abilities.

  
6. **""Ultron’s Fractured Reality""**

* Players fight across broken timelines, each featuring unique conditions (e.g., no healing, only cosmic characters allowed, or random ally swaps).
* Final stage pits players against Infinity Ultron, who adapts based on your team’s traits (like countering Blasters or Controllers).

  
7. **""Watcher’s Gambit""**

* A randomized multiverse draft mode.
* Players are given random ""What If?"" characters to form their team, forcing creative use of unorthodox synergies.
* Each stage adds randomized buffs or debuffs to keep things unpredictable.

  
8. **""Kang’s Chrono Conquest""**

* Inspired by Kang’s timeline manipulation powers.
* Players face enemies across different time eras (e.g., WWII Hydra soldiers, 2099 tech warriors) with varying buffs/debuffs depending on the era.
* Boss fights involve time-loop mechanics, forcing players to adapt as Kang rewinds or fast-forwards certain effects."

Gotham Detective Files: Advent (Story so far),batman,1hljmra,2024-12-24 13:36:06,6,0.88,1,https://i.redd.it/81edtgv4cu8e1.jpeg,Thick-Community-6307,GENERAL DISCUSSION,"""The Last Holiday""
Gotham City was no stranger to madness, but this time, it felt different. The air was heavy, the ticking clocks seemed louder, and an unnatural stillness lingered over the city like a forgotten hymn. Julian Day, known to Gotham as Calendar Man, had always been obsessed with the passage of time, but now his obsession had spiraled into  

Day 1: A New Obsession
Locked away in Arkham Asylum, Julian Day sat in his cell, staring at a worn calendar pinned to the wall. Unlike others, he didn’t see months or seasons—he saw power. Time ruled all things, and Julian was determined to master it.

Day 2: Seeds of a Plan
Months ago, Julian overheard whispers of an experimental temporal device at Wayne Tech. A machine that could manipulate time itself. A twisted grin spread across his face. ""Why settle for marking days when I can own them?""

Day 3: The Tyranny of Time
Julian saw time as the true villain: indifferent, relentless, stealing everything from everyone. “Why should time dictate our lives?” he mused. “No more clocks. No more aging. No more endings.”

Day 4: A Christmas Obsession
For Julian, Christmas wasn’t a time of joy—it was a reminder of wasted years. Families celebrated, unaware of the fleeting nature of their happiness. ""Let them cling to their precious holiday,"" he sneered, ""until they choke on it.""

Day 5: The First Heist
Months before the chaos began, Calendar Man orchestrated a daring heist at Wayne Tech. In the dead of night, his henchmen stole blueprints for a device labeled Chrono Stabilizer Prototype. The clock was ticking.

Day 6: The Clock Tower's Secret
Julian chose the abandoned Gotham Clock Tower as his base of operations. Its gears and ticking mechanisms were the perfect backdrop for his masterpiece. ""Let the city hear its own countdown,"" he whispered.

Day 7: A Message Left Behind
As Batman investigated the theft at Wayne Tech, he found a single note scrawled in red ink:
""Time waits for no one... but me.""

Day 8: The Gas of Eternity
Calendar Man struck again, this time at a LexCorp warehouse. He stole canisters of Chrono-Gas, an experimental compound designed to manipulate perception of time. With it, he could bend Gotham to his will.

Day 9: An Endless Eve
Julian’s plan solidified. Using the Chrono-Gas and Wayne Tech's prototype, he would trap Gotham in an eternal Christmas Eve. No more tomorrows. No more consequences. Just the endless now.

Day 10: The Perfect Prison
In his journal, Julian wrote: “A timeless world is a perfect world. No aging. No regrets. No failures. Just peace. And yet… only I will hold the key.”

Day 11: Testing the Gas
Before unleashing his plan, Julian tested the Chrono-Gas on Arkham inmates. They relived the same hour over and over, clawing at the walls in confusion. Julian watched, unbothered. ""Madness,"" he said, ""is relative.""

Day 12: The Gotham Broadcast
One week before Christmas, Gotham’s screens flickered. Calendar Man appeared, his face lit by candlelight. “Tick, tock, Gotham. Your time is running out. Or perhaps… it already has.”

Day 13: Batman’s First Clue
Batman analyzed Calendar Man’s broadcast and found a hidden code in the flickering lights. It pointed to the Gotham Clock Tower, but Bruce knew it wouldn’t be that simple.

Day 14: The Holiday Countdown
Each day, Julian left clues across the city—cryptic riddles, marked calendars, even graffiti scrawled on walls. Every clue pushed Gotham closer to the loop he had planned.

Day 15: An Old Grudge
Julian’s hatred for Batman ran deep. “The Detective moves forward while I am left behind,” he muttered. “This time, he will chase me in circles.”

Day 16: Gotham’s Nightmare
As Christmas Eve arrived, Julian activated his machine. Waves of Chrono-Gas spread across the city, freezing Gotham in time. Midnight struck—but instead of moving forward, the clock rewound.

Day 17: The First Loop
Gotham awoke on Christmas Eve… again. The city’s residents noticed strange déjà vu. Presents were rewrapped. Snow fell in the same patterns. Something was wrong.

Day 18: The Bat’s Frustration
For Batman, the loops were a personal hell. Each day, he awoke in a new location, disoriented but determined. He realized Julian was mocking him, dragging him through the same day over and over.

Day 19: A City in Chaos
As the loops continued, Gotham began to crack. People became desperate, some choosing to relive the same joys, while others turned violent. Calendar Man watched from the clock tower, satisfied.

Day 20: Julian’s True Motive
“This isn’t chaos,” Julian mused, watching Gotham from his perch. “This is control. In a timeless world, I am their god.”

Day 21: A Final Clue
Calendar Man left one final riddle for Batman, etched into the face of the Gotham Clock Tower. It hinted at the machine’s weak point—but only if Batman could solve it in time.

Day 22: The Confrontation
Batman arrived at the clock tower. Julian greeted him with a sinister grin. “Do you feel it yet, Detective? The weight of eternity pressing down on you?”

Day 23: A Dangerous Gambit
Julian revealed his cruelest twist: if Batman destroyed the machine recklessly, the temporal field would collapse, erasing Gotham from existence. “Checkmate,” he taunted.

The Coraxian Heresy: The Cobalt King (Part-4),HorusGalaxy,1hkhl4b,2024-12-23 01:08:54,10,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorusGalaxy/comments/1hkhl4b/the_coraxian_heresy_the_cobalt_king_part4/,Firm-Dependent-2367,Work In Progress ,"The Cobalt King's domains have an exceptionally rich and colorful history since there are records of his work. He has carried out unconventional yet devastating attacks against various races to build his Empire. 

After building the Precipice Station his first primary action was against a group of migrating Hrud. The fascination of the Hrud with temporal technology and scavenging advanced technology, and their constant infiltration and infestation across the galaxy made them a striking target for the Noctis Eterna in 992.M41. This led to the One Second War, which was over in one Terran Second. While it seems ridiculous, the truth was that it was a temporal War utilizing technology to fight across time. It was one of the few conflicts the Cobalt King participated personally in, slaughtering Hrud and gaining experience ""beyond his years."" In the end, all the Hrud in the Segmentum Obscurus lay dead. The Cobalt King acquired technology that allowed him to secure his Empire further. There are many rumors about this conflict. Some say remnants of the Ordo Chronos was involved. This seems ludicrous Officially. Some even say that this technology was used for some reality-warping shenanigans. 

After this conflict there were numerous conflicts with the Imperium, including the Skirmish of Szalar Star Fortress in 993.M41, which led to the loss of Imperial foothold in Segmentum Pacificus. This also included the Devastation of Sabbat in 994.M41, when the entire area and several hundred lightyears around it went Dark. Essentially the Imperium controlled only four Segmentae now, with only the Forge-Worlds controlled by the Tech-Templar having enough technology to maintain themselves in the devastated Imperium. 

As the Red Crusade began in 999.M41, the priorities of the Cobalt King changed. Recognition of Chaos as a common foe certainly had something to do with it. While unable to make it to the defense of Cadia, they aided in defending the Blackstone Fortresses and Gene-Seed stockpiles of the Imperium (While secretly appropriating some to themselves).

While they certainly went their separate ways, the Imperium allied and clashed with the Cobalt King more than once after that. For example, the Pariah Nexus War in 145.M42 was a part where the Imperium in the Indomitus Crusade breached the Silent King's project. The Cobalt King knew of the feud between the Technomandrites and the Silent King and hired them to assist the Imperium and Imotekh's forces in destroying the Pariah Nexus. The Technomandrites bombed the Pariah Nexus, and supplied arms to the Cobalt King's forces. While not destroyed, the Pariah Nexus was severely damaged. A member of the Golden Order, Black Templar High Marshal Joseph Stave, codename ""Soldier Boy,"" was captured and experimented upon by Illuminior Szeras, but chose to kill himself before revealing anything. 

In 098.M41 the King's Chief Empiricist, Diamat Gundam, reverse-engineered Rangdan technology and genetically experimented on Orks. Doing so he created a wave of Greenskins never seen before. More than fifteen feet tall each, the Warboss called himself a ""Warlord"" of Orks. The Cobalt King threw him and his entire horde into the Eye of Terror to wreak havoc on the Chaos forces. 

The first loss of the Cobalt King was in the Hades Nebula against a combined Alliance of the Imperium and the Votann. The Cobalt King desired the Hades Nebula for their own purposes. The Votann had an enormous resource collection ecosystem in the area and were unwilling to lose it. The Votann were powerful but lacked the capabilities to directly hurt Noctis Eterna. Therefore they sought the Imperium's aid, claiming to relinquish all claims to the Jaw Installation if the Imperium aided them in the defense of the Hades Nebula. Luckily, the combined Alliance in 194.M42-202.M42 led to the defeat of the Noctis Eterna. But neither the Votann or the Imperium were ready to hold on to the deal: The Votann were too hateful of the Imperium and the Tech-Templar, while the Imperium sought to expand its holdings in the Galactic Core. When the Votann reneged on their deal, the Imperium seized the Nebula along with all existing Votann resource collection apparatus. This led to a furthering of the feud between the Imperium and the Votann. 

When Lion'El Jonson visited the planet of Nuhaif to stop the Cobalt King in 238.M42, he dueled him personally. In the King's presence Jonson found himself unable to use his point-to-point teleportation ability. It was said that he knocked the King's helmet off, but such rumors are unconfirmed. The planet was lost however, and Jonson was forced to escape.

Introduction of Attrius.,wizardposting,1hhitx1,2024-12-18 21:41:00,20,0.79,92,https://i.redd.it/qr33tfq6xp7e1.jpeg,Alx3t_,Lorepost📖,"Alvin Cer Attrius, heir to/head of the Attrius Family Archives of the (probably fallen) Arcamania Empire.

He is a stoic man who, after almost 230 years of continuous battle and scheming, has a messed up and gray moral compass.

He has very few friends, some who are dead, some who have been dead when he met them, or some who are beings beyond comprehension, somehow.

He has a very diverse arsenal, being an Artificer, Battlemage, and an aspiring Chronomancer, which is why he got into magic in the first place.

That being said, he has a unique way of fighting, which includes rewinding time on his weapons (ranged ones to be exact), fighting with (and throwing) daggers, using simple and complex spells simultaneously to attack or support himself (and others) in battle, and finally, combining spells with his technology.

He named it ChronoTech, uncaring of whether or not the name has already been taken. Though, it is very consuming on his mana, so he doesn't use it unless in dire situations.

He's in-between not caring about the world at all, and wanting to be involved in it, trying to decide which to choose.

I'll think more about it later, but this is the baseline. I found the image on Pinterest while searching for other things that I forgot.

I kinda have a soft spot for FF4: The After Years,FinalFantasy,1hh695k,2024-12-18 12:08:17,15,0.78,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1hh695k/i_kinda_have_a_soft_spot_for_ff4_the_after_years/,PizzaCrescent2070,FF IV,"Let's set the scene, I was around 5th-6th  grade and I was bored scrolling through the Wii Shop Channel for something to play. I came across FF4: The After Years because it was free to play, so I got it and tried it out. I really loved the game and I ended up buying all the chapters.

As a kid, I was averse to grinding so I breezed through the game and got stuck a few times. When I couldn't wait to see the ending, I just watched gameplay videos and was blown away by the PSP version. From there, I watched a lot of Final Fantasy gameplay videos and got the games on mobile.

The band system is pretty cool and similar to how the Dual Tech works in Chrono Trigger.

Although this game isn't well liked by the community, I appreciate the game for introducing me to the series."
Balance Idea for Starcraft 2 to Shake Up EVERYTHING!,starcraft,1hg4dv3,2024-12-17 01:11:57,0,0.38,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1hg4dv3/balance_idea_for_starcraft_2_to_shake_up/,WildCardsc,(To be tagged...),"Give every unit two new upgrades on their respective tech buildings. This will vastly increase the decisions allowed and open up a lot of creativity between players.

Balance council can let this run WILD and focus their balancing on removing the dominating OP strats each season (there will be a lot more strats).

Of course, any 2 upgrades can be replaced with better ideas, but they should complement the unit in an incremental way. I had to come up with a lot of ideas here, so if you don't like one be sure to call it out but also suggest something better.

Downsizing my Airsoft arsenal to buy more Christmas gifts for friends and family. All prices are firm and as low as I can go; Christmas deals for you guys!

For sale are:

1) Atlas Custom Works/Ace1Arms Magpul X-22 Backpacker build

https://imgur.com/uHfvMxq

https://imgur.com/C3jhKfS

- Atlas Custom Works/Ace1Arms X22 base
- Magpul X-22 Backpacker stock
- Magpul X-22 Backpacker optic mount
- Angel Custom KC02 flash hider
- KJW thread adapter
- RA-Tech 6.01 tightbore inner barrel
- Modify Accurate bucking
- Waldo Customs nozzle return spring
- x2 KJW short magazines (no leaks)
- free red dot included

Modified the jet valve to increase FPS (approx 490fps w/ .2g using propane), installed a fiber optic front sight on the outer barrel, and modified the bolt by dremeling sections that have high, unnecessary friction against the top of the receiver.

Magpul Backpacker stock magazine compartment has been dremeled out to be able to fit 1 short magazine neatly. Magpul X-22 optic mount was modified to fit the oversized outer barrel perfectly. Both semi and full auto work flawlessly. In full auto, the ROF is very high. This rifle is extremely quiet and will be even more quiet with a foam-filled suppressor installed.

The high fps mod was meant to turn this rifle into a backyard plinker/pest control tool, but it will easily be a great outdoor Airsoft rifle. 

The locking mechanism does wobble a little side to side (as all takedown rifles, even real steel do), but I’ve added a larger oring over the hop up housing to fit the outer barrel more snug with the receiver. If an optic is mounted on the Magpul mount on the barrel, it is very accurate!

2) KWA M11A1 build with Arts Steel Body Kit

https://imgur.com/a/WXS6luz (modifications)

https://imgur.com/K5R9pSh (current state with drilled crosspin inserts on both sides of lower receiver for added realism)

- KWA M11A1 base
- Arts Airsoft steel body kit (original KWA wire stock since it is more appealing and durable)
- Original KWA plastic receiver set
- Wii Tech CNC aluminum loading nozzle kit
- Angel Custom silicone bucking
- x3 KWA magazines with Angel Custom steel high flow valves installed (no leaks)
- real steel M11 front hanger strap modified to fit
- x2 Lees Precision Engineering 14mm CCW CNC aluminum outer barrels
- included Arts Airsoft steel outer barrel

The M11A1 build is solid and the rounds feed flawlessly. Both semi and full auto work completely fine and the magazine lips have been dremeled and polished to feed rounds into the hop up chamber without marring the BBs. The feed ramp has also been angled and polished to ensure the gun is free of feeding issues. Chronoed avg 330fps w/ .2g using propane.

ROF is very high and has not had any issues dumping full magazines since I’ve modified the internals. I’ve also cut a custom sorbo pad to fit the bolt return rod (for added realism and to minimize damage to the bolt when firing. The Wii Tech loading nozzle is installed with the oring-type CNC piston head; perfect air seal. The seal between the nozzle and bucking is great too! Spent a lot of money on parts and shipping. Spent a lot of time waiting for them to arrive and fitting everything together. This is the perfect sidearm for any loadout and a great primary SMG for any CQB.

$300 shipped and fee’d [SOLD]

Works perfectly fine and is able to go through a full magazine without any issues. Recoil is very nice with this kit and the slide is snappy. Only internal mod I recall doing to this is changing the magazine route seal to Nineball & the magazine output valve to Angel Custom. This is a beautiful, reliable pistol to skirmish with! Chronoed approximately 290fps w/ .2g using propane.

The pistol works perfectly fine and I’ve only changed out a sear spring to a stiffer one which made the pistol shoot normally (it used to shoot in full auto out of nowhere, but I’ve read online that people with this pistol have the same issue with it). It works just as it should after I’ve modified it and is very nice. I’ve also changed out the inlet valve on the base of the magazine to a larger, more durable one. It’ll come with 1 non-leaky magazine.

A pretty rare Maruzen MP5K I’ve kind of partially fixed up and added a PDW side-folding stock on. It shoots in semi and full auto fine. The SMG is missing the paddle release, but the side release button is intact so you can still insert and remove the magazine. There are replacement paddle releases on the market, but I did not want to purchase one from Evike if they don’t stock it in their Alhambra, CA location (I don’t like having to wait for parts to get shipped to my house). The short magazine included does leak slowly from the magazine base, but I don’t have the time to look for a fitting rubber gasket to install and fix it. You can still shoot with the magazine!

Rifle works perfectly. However, the magazine does need a new gasket that I don’t have time to make. You can still shoot with the magazine! The rifle has only been used in my room after buying it and has less than 300 rounds through it. The nozzle return spring and nozzle oring have been replaced with Waldo Customs return spring and a slightly larger oring for stronger compression. I was going to build this into a G36K, but my funds went to my other builds. This will also come with a G36K handle with integrated magnified optic.

Pretty much new-in-box; I’ve displayed it on my wall but still have the box, manual, and all the goodies it originally came with. The gun shoots as it should and the previous owner had swapped the mini deans to large deans. I don’t play with AEGs so this was just a cool thing to look at. It has two mid caps and two lipo batteries (one battery that originally comes with the KG9 that’s wired to mini deans, and one battery that’s wired to large deans)

Very rare, in great condition, and comes with the original box. Has 10 shells in great condition. The springer shoots and ejects as it should! This springer was made in 1991, so I’d advise you play with caution since the plastic might crack. However, there are no signs of cracking at all. Tested to make sure it worked and put it right back into the box to preserve. Beautiful piece of Airsoft history to own!

Vintage Omega M93R pistol with folding stock. Comes with 1 slow-leak magazine. This is a copy of the early MGC M93R. Pistol shoots but is finicky and I do not want to try and tinker around with the internals as it looks pretty complex. It is a VINTAGE gas blowback pistol!

"[Brainstorming] Thinking of a combat system, throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks",RPGdesign,1hbiagk,2024-12-10 20:41:15,8,0.79,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1hbiagk/brainstorming_thinking_of_a_combat_system/,SimplyYulia,Mechanics,"So, I'm back on my bullshit of trying to make a TTRPG despite not really playing too many TTRPGs in my life. I wanted to try to do ""TTJRPG"" thing - i.e. another take on what Fabula Ultima is trying to do. Currently on a brainstorming stage, and just had a thought on combat system, ~~stolen~~ heavily inspired by a videogame I played quite a while ago.

- Each enemy has a health bar and a shield bar
- There's two types of attacks. Normal attacks generate energy and deplete shields, Special attacks consume energy, can have an element and deal damage once shield is down
- Players have roles, that can be changed mid-battle (with a penalty):
  - Damage dealer, deals double damage with Special attacks, and also when the shield is up they hit an enemy vulnerability, they weaken the shield
  - Breaker, their Normal attacks generate energy for whole team, and also their Special attacks can break weakened shield immediately
  - Defender - their attacks draw aggro and their Special attacks can apply debuffs
  - Healer - they can heal allies and apply buffs
- On the next round after breaking enemy refills the shield
- It's not one-to-one to videogame I'm ""getting inspired"" by, I wonder if anyone can guess which. But I hope, it isn't too much plagiatrism, since I only took shield/health separation and four roles
- Players and enemies take turns in separate rounds, all players (in any order that they agree to), then all enemies, then players again
- Breaking the shield makes an enemy skip their turn - or at least heavily mitigates their damage
- Players can do multiple actions per turn

So, what do you think, does it sound interesting? It probably still needs more time in the oven to actually make it viable, but the main idea?

My concerns:

- It might be too videogamey, without really utilizing potential of TTRPGs
- Energy that refills and is spent on every turn will be painful to track
- It might get too repetative and complex, without really providing enough tactical depth - you have all this stuff, but in the end in combat you'll be doing same thing again and again
- Will probably be pain to balance
- Asymmetry between players and enemies - it's literally impossible to have PvP

My further ideas on what more I'd like to have:

- Players have classes (even probably obligatory multiclassing), and each class can be applicable in multiple roles. Classes give access to Special attacks that behave differently for different roles
- Dual techs, a la chrono trigger, depending on classes that characters involved have and roles they use
- Simplified positioning system? I really dislike regular grid systems, so either ""near/far"" system (you can be ""near"" some enemies, or ""far"" from them), or simplified 3x3 grid (multiple characters can stay in the same cell, and it is considered adjacent)
- As continuation of positioning system, boss attacks inspired by MMOs, like stack markers and AOE hitting specific squares

So, what do you think?"
Frozen Freedom,stupidpol,1ha98kq,2024-12-09 08:03:16,12,0.84,13,https://damagemag.com/2024/12/09/frozen-freedom/?ref=articles-newsletter,Dingo8dog,Capitalist Hellscape,"Artificial Reproductive Technologies (ART) have grown exponentially this century, showcasing the emancipatory and risk-management power of biotech. ART promises not only “reproductive freedom” for individuals and couples unable to procreate through sexual intercourse, but also, for fertile, heterosexual women, the freedom to begin motherhood at later ages. Celebrity forty-somethings sport tech-assisted babies on immaculate figures, boutique clinics advertise domestic bliss on individual terms, while egg freezing has become an increasingly ubiquitous insurance policy for professional thirty-something women uncertain about their romantic and reproductive futures. 

The number of egg-freezing cycles in the US performed annually climbed from 7,600 in 2012 to 29,803 in 2022, with roughly a million eggs and embryos stored in the country today. Women are freezing eggs at progressively younger ages, with fertility clinics actively targeting women in their 20s. The “baby panic” of the early aughts, in which professional women worried about waiting too long to have a baby for career or romantic reasons and regretting it, has putatively been solved. Women, it seems, really can now have it all, free to pursue professional, maternal, and romantic goals and dreams with greater independence and optionality. No longer enslaved by their “biological clock,” women have gained control of what psychoanalyst Katie Gentile calls their “reprofuturity.” But what sort of freedom is actually offered through reproductive technologies—and to whom?

The cost of ART is staggering. A cycle of egg freezing or IVF runs $10,000-$30,000; many cycles of each, if not both, are often required, often on top of additional hormones, medications, storage fees, and so on. These procedures are rarely covered by state and private insurance in the US. That said, insurance contractors for major companies increasingly provide ART, with professional women in large corporations commonly incentivized to freeze eggs through this coverage. At least one economist found that every year a woman postpones having kids leads to a 10% increase in career earnings, making ART economically advantageous to the affluent women who can obtain them. For everyone else, ART often remains prohibitively expensive. 

Indeed, the cost of ART has only risen with demand, with companies capitalizing on the willingness of women with means to pay nearly anything for the chance at motherhood. Psychological research tells us that once people have invested in something, they are more likely to continue to invest. This holds true here, with failures often leading to redoubled effort. And, even for those who can financially afford it, the biological and psychological costs are high. ART involves grueling procedures, including intensive monitoring, hormone injections, multiple surgeries—and all often leading to heartbreak. Rates of success are surprisingly low, given the hype: the chances of having a baby through ART are hard to predict precisely, but data suggests a success rate of 30-40%. And only about 12% of women who freeze their eggs wind up retrieving them.  

Given these costs, the desired gains must be immense. And indeed, what could be more precious than a baby? Or more empowering than female emancipation from bio-repro-chrono limitations and compulsions? As a psychotherapist in private practice in San Francisco, I’ve had plenty of occasion to reflect on both the benefits and discontents of ART.

Certainly, success cases sparkle with opportunity and promise. Heather, a highly driven C-suite executive self-consciously willing to trade domestic for professional success, froze her eggs as an insurance policy. When she met Will, an investment banker capable of supporting a family single-handedly, she was glad she’d done so. Delivering twins at 42 was physically demanding, but motherhood brought immense joy. Heather stopped working until her twins started kindergarten.Then she launched a successful private consulting business, with flexibility to continue to focus on parenting. 

Many stories, however, are less positive, and not just for the obvious reasons. Cases of multiple rounds of IVF ending in failure, eggs destroyed in storage or transition, and other starkly difficult experiences abound. But painful stories of failure only point to the need for more effective, reliable ART. Less catastrophic experiences point to more complex problems. 

Consider Mindy and Michael, a couple who first came in for treatment in their mid-thirties. Both worked in tech and had insurance coverage for ART. They’d been together nearly five years, enjoying the Bay Area’s “work hard, play hard” lifestyle. Michael was ready for a new chapter, eager to buy a home and start a family. Mindy wanted to delay, stating that while she wanted these things too, she wasn’t ready yet. She wanted to travel more, have fun, and further advance her career before motherhood. Her ambivalence about children was pronounced: “I like the idea of kids—and grandkids—but being a mom? I don’t know. It makes me uncomfortable. Just hearing the word ‘mom’ kinda stresses me out.” We began to explore Mindy’s ambivalence in therapy, but the couple quickly decided to freeze embryos to allow Mindy more time and freedom—or more time for freedom. They also purchased a home, which initially brought Michael a sense of life stage progression. The frozen embryos felt relieving and reassuring for them both. 

After two years, however, Michael’s pressing desire for children resurfaced. Mindy shared that their home had amplified the part of her that wanted children, but she still wanted more time. She resented Michael’s urgency. “It’s my body, after all,” she said, “I have to give up so much more than you, I want you to be supportive of me and my choices.” Michael agreed he couldn’t fully comprehend the sense of sacrifice and constriction she experienced when thinking about motherhood. They decided to delay for another 18 months and then begin a pregnancy. They also agreed to open their relationship to allow Mindy to experience a greater sense of freedom before committing fully to Michael and motherhood. Mindy’s anxiety and ambivalence only intensified, however. She very much wanted a family and couldn’t imagine not having children, but she also wasn’t able to shake the perception of motherhood as a sentence: the end of everything she enjoyed about her current life. 

When she met someone else, no one was surprised. There was a painful separation and the embryos were destroyed. Michael, hurt and angry, might well go on to have children. Mindy, confused, regretful, and now 40, most likely will not. Perhaps that’s what she ultimately wanted, but I’m not convinced. Freezing embryos had allowed her to leave an internal conflict unresolved. ART offered this couple a frozen freedom that suspended their life, an agency engineered to evade a choice that would have allowed them to move forward one way or another. 

In another example, Christina, a corporate attorney who struggled with dating, froze her eggs to de-couple romantic and reproductive choices. Christina had suffered a series of traumatic relationships in her teens and early twenties and had become self-protective and highly selective when I met her shortly following her thirty-second birthday. She thought deeply about what she wanted in a partner: intelligence, creativity, kindness, generosity, humor, adventure, and professional passion and success. She dated methodically but did not encounter anyone worth pursuing. Some men bored her. Others annoyed her with their arrogance and “mansplaining.” If she did find someone suitable, he either had no interest in procreating or was  divorced with young children. She vacillated between blaming herself for being too picky and blaming men for being ubiquitously disappointing. Consistently, she communicated that she would rather be single than settle, and that she only wanted to have children with a partner—and that she needed to have children soon or risk loss of fertility. 

The tension between these things created panic. Feeling desperate at 34, she froze eggs to allow her to date with more freedom. But freezing her eggs only intensified her selectivity: now that she had spent tens of thousands of dollars and put her body through the process, she was determined to find the right mate, who stubbornly remained a fantasy. According to some, Christina is the victim of the “mating gap”, in which motherhood-ready, highly educated professional women outpace their male counterparts and struggle to find partners on equal footing. A medical anthropologist at Yale interviewed 150 women who volunteered for her study through their egg freezing clinics. Of these, 115 were fertile heterosexual women in their mid-thirties driven to freeze their eggs through persistent frustration in dating. These women reported being financially and emotionally ready for children, leading the anthropologist to conclude that something often billed as a female crisis may in fact reflect a male one. Certainly, men today are struggling across multiple domains, giving rise to widespread alarm. Perhaps egg freezing extends women’s odds in a difficult field. 

And yet I wonder: if Christina had settled, would she perhaps have found a way to make it work? Could she have had children, gotten divorced, and returned to dating, decoupling her romantic and reproductive timelines in a different manner? Regardless, Christina, now 38, is unhappy with the state of her life. Recently she asked me, “Do you remember Sebastian?” I said I did. “He was okay. Not great, but definitely okay. He would have had a family with me. Maybe I should have done that. I’ll never know. And I know it’s dumb to regret things. But I think about it. I guess I think about it because I feel so stuck now, I don’t know what to do any more.” Sometimes by expanding our limits, we narrow our possibilities. Or rather, limits can generate possibility just as their absence or transcendence can.

Talia, a successful manager in tech sales, feels enormous pressure to freeze her eggs at 33. Talia knew from a young age that professional success was important to her and has worked hard as a young woman in sales to manage a large team at a renowned company. She loves the work and thrives in the competitive environment. Her goal is to be a VP at 35. She’s not sure whether or not she wants children: “I guess I always figured I would. I’m not opposed, but it hasn’t been on my radar. I’d like to cross that bridge later.” She has been dating someone she really likes for about a year, and in theory she has many reproductive years ahead of her. Everyone is different, but evidence suggests that fertility doesn’t begin to decline precipitously until 40. 

Friends and family keep pressuring her to freeze her eggs, however. “You might regret it if you don’t,” they tell her, “It’s the intelligent thing to do.” Egg freezing is covered by Talia’s insurance, but she still would rather not go through the physical and emotional experience. “I get it, it’s the smart, safe thing, but it’s not nothing, and I have to wonder about all the pressure. Like, I’m in sales, and this is being sold hard! And what if I find out something I’d rather not know? What if I find out I can’t have kids and that’s devastating now, whereas it might not be in four years? Maybe I actually don’t want to have kids, but I don’t know that yet, and now I’ll just wind up having them because I froze my eggs, so I’ll feel like I have to, and I’ll hate it?” Whatever Talia decides to do, she’s asking good questions. She’s aware that something that seems like an obviously positive choice might have unintended consequences. Ultimately, though, she decided the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and froze her eggs. Talia is part of a cohort of women for whom the supposed optionality of egg freezing has become compulsive. 

Among other things, ART can be seen as yet another neoliberal perversion of freedom, in which freedom is understood as the removal of constraints (freedom from the body, from sex, from time) in order to do whatever you want (preferably without question or consequence). It’s an impoverished and immature vision. In children’s dreams of the pleasure of choice, adulthood is often confused with omnipotence. But adult reality is inevitably a disappointment. Indeed, the central project of adulthood is finding pleasure within reality, freedom within limits. In health, we negotiate a good enough balance between desire and reality—otherwise, we remain neurotically tortured. 

To escape neurotic captivity, we must learn to pursue our desires creatively and courageously. The seductive fantasy of having it all fosters anxiety and ambivalence by perpetuating the impossible architecture of the infantile desire for freedom. We attempt to control experience at the expense of living it—losses, regrets, and messes included. Modern women often feel especially pressured to have or be it “all,” so perhaps women are especially prone to want it all too—to be seduced by the illusion of limitless optionality, the tyranny of infinite choice… for the right price. Of course, we want freedom from external compulsion, but a substitute for internal compulsion proves a raw deal. ART promises women the ultimate freedom from biological procreation, but in so doing, it stimulates ambivalence about motherhood, paralysis about mating, and compulsion around costly procedures. The neurotic version of agency gets mistaken for the real thing, leaving women less satisfied—and also less free.

Fps has dropped drastically since upgrades ,airsoft,1h922oo,2024-12-07 15:57:31,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1h922oo/fps_has_dropped_drastically_since_upgrades/,PropertyOk745,,"I have a Echo 1 Redstar AK47 that I bought as a teen (now 31 years old). 
When I first started playing again a couple months ago it was shooting around 360fps with .32 bbs
And that was confirmed by the chrono at the field I play.

Decided to upgrade the gun a good bit. New piston, piston head, cylinder, cylinder head, air nozzle, hop up, 6.03 455mm inner barrel, high torque motor, bucking, nub, mosfet, 11.1 lipo battery, 16:1 gears, Sector gear delay chip, shimmed, and greased the gears. 

I'm new to doing tech work. So maybe I've missed something along the way. I tested the airseal in the piston and cylinder assembly and it was phenomenally better than the stock parts air seal. 

Just played with the gun first time since completing all upgrades today and with .32 gram bbs, the chrono said it's shooting 183fps

What did I do wrong or completely miss? Lol

Thank you for any insight!"

Gotham Detective Files: Advent °1,batman,1h3pu6m,2024-11-30 18:49:49,7,0.78,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3pu6m,Thick-Community-6307,GENERAL DISCUSSION,"Every villain leaves a trail—can you follow it?

Gotham is under siege—not by brute force, but by the relentless ticking of the clock. Calendar Man, the master of temporal chaos, has unleashed his most diabolical plan yet. With the stolen technology of Wayne Tech and the sinister Chrono-Gas from LexCorp, Julian Day has trapped the city in a never-ending Christmas Eve. Midnight comes, but instead of a new day, Gotham rewinds, forced to relive the same 24 hours over and over.

Calendar Man claims it’s a gift: “No more deadlines. No more aging. No more tomorrows. Just an endless, perfect present.” But Gotham’s citizens are breaking under the strain, and the Dark Knight is racing against time—literally—to stop this eternal loop before the city tears itself apart.

That’s where you come in.

Each day, Calendar Man leaves cryptic riddles, daring Gotham to solve them. Hidden within these clues are pieces of his twisted plan. By solving them, help Batman uncover the truth and, hopefully, restore Gotham to its rightful timeline.

But beware: Calendar Man is a mastermind, and his riddles are only the beginning. Each answer brings you closer to unraveling his sinister plot—and to a final confrontation where every clue will matter.
Think you can keep up with the world’s greatest detective? Then step into Gotham’s longest night. Solve the riddles, follow the clues, and help Batman save Christmas before time runs out... forever.

BB Factory Replica Hublot Sang Bleu II Ceramic Green Watch,replicawatchreview,1h39gz0,2024-11-30 05:00:52,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/replicawatchreview/comments/1h39gz0/bb_factory_replica_hublot_sang_bleu_ii_ceramic/,hongchuanlee,,"https://preview.redd.it/fbm0zqg6i04e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c74e27b74136d6e73f40e5b66a43ef571b4f1d5

It looks very advanced and high-tech. The Big Bang Sang Bleu II is a watch which Hublot brings a big surprise to their fans and gives them a shocking visual enjoyment. The watch is up to 45mm in case diameter, not many people can hold it. Today, I want to share a review on the green ceramic Sang Bleu II replica watch that was just published by BB factory. About the replica Hublot Big Bang Sang Bleu, three watch factories made it before, they are HB, WF and BB. Among these three factories, WF has the longest watch-making history, HB mainly produces middle quality Hublot replica watches, BB is a new name we just heard in this industry, some people said that BB factory, which is also called BBF, is a branch of ZF, I am not sure about this, ZF already has another name PPF in Nautilus field, now if BBF is also a name which ZF uses in Hublot field, then things become very interesting. Why does a factory use different name under the different brand replicas they make? Maybe to avoid the risk of being caught, maybe some person has a cooperation with this factory. For example, a small workshop in the market makes this Hublot Sang Bleu II replica watch, to increase sales, they found ZF and told they want to sell their watches under factory name “ZF”, ZF agreed, so in the marketing of this replica watch, the audience was being told the replica watch is produced by ZF, and BBF is another name of ZF, actually BBF is just another small team.

The Sang Bleu II replica watch, more people like the white cermice watch made by BB factory. This green ceramic version is a new model they just published. The watch is fully made with real green ceramic, it is very thick, about 16.7mm. The case has a very unique design, there are different geometric figures, this is a replica watch with chronograph function, but it may be not easy for you to find the chrono buttons because they have been seamlessly integrated with the case, also made with green ceramic. The dial uses a special way to show the time, you need to keep a certain focus to get an accurate timing from the dial, two small dials at 3 and 9 are for small seconds and 60-minute chronograph display separately. For such an unique dial design, the factory must have spent a lot of time and money to research and produce this replica watch, which looks very close to genuine watch but can not be checked carefully, you know such complicated dial must have a lot of differences. The movement is not a super clone, on the basis of a Chinese 7750 chronograph movement, BB factory just modified the auto rotor to make it look like the one on the genuine movement.

Hublot replica watches were very popular in our market in the past, but they almost have disappeared in recent years since the closure of V6 factory. Now most Hublot Big Bang replica watches are produced by HB factory, but their quality can not be compared with that of V6. On some dealers’ websites, I see they still use “V6F” on the title of some Hublot watches products, I am not sure if this is the same V6 factory as the one before. Now I also heard that the quality of some Omega Seamaster replica watches from VS factory is not as good as the ones they made before.

Will my plan work? Confused about NG+ and Continue+,ChronoCross,1h2qusr,2024-11-29 12:25:44,5,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1h2qusr/will_my_plan_work_confused_about_ng_and_continue/,average_hero,Question,"Before posting I honestly did try to research this but all the info I found was conflicting and confusing so I thought I'd ask for clarification pertaining to what I'm trying to do.

I try to end a game with a ""100% completed"" save file. For this game, it's pretty complicated. I've already completed the game once and didn't leave a save before the ending so all I have is the completed game save file. My plan is:

1. Use completed game save file to NG+ into a new game.
2. Recruit Nikki (I recruited Guile the first time), save Kid (I didn't the first time), and beat the Time Devourer once I've got Harle in the party.
3. Use the new completed game save file to NG+ into a third game.
4. Recruit Pierre and fight the Time Devourer.
5. Start a completely New Game, get the Chrono Cross, and pull all my characters through.

My questions are:

1. Will this work? If I've daisy-chained NG+ games, will using the Continue+ pull all the characters I've recruited through the three playthroughs or only the ones recruited at the time I fought the Time Devourer in the most recent complete file? If it's the later, I understand I could fairly easily work around that to achieve my goal - I would just like to know to prepare for it.
2. Can I still get dual Einlanzers for Glenn if you recruit him via Chrono Cross? I understand you can only get Razzly's lvl 7 tech if you meet certain criteria - including saving Kid - so I plan on saving Kid and not recruiting Glenn normally for my last playthrough (the completely new game in step 5). I would still like him to be in my end game party with dual Einlanzers because it's amazing.
3. Are there any other ""perfect game"" items you can think of? I want to end the game with all characters, all of them with all of their techs and best equipment available, all dopplegangs, 99 stars, etc. Any extra thoughts or guidance?
4. I still don't fully comprehend ""stat-maxing"" and ""mini-levels"" in this game. As I understand it, leveling stats in between star levels is essentially just front-loading stats for your current party and isn't a necessary part of ""stat-maxing"" in this game. Is this correct? If not - and it actually is an important part of ""stat-maxing,"" how does that work with Continue+? If I decide to grind stats in between star levels for my last playthrough but then load a Continue+ into the game, they will all be promoted to the completed game's star level, correct? Will they keep their original stat gains or the completed game's stat gains?

Any thoughts/comments/guidance greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"

I know this is kind of crazy as it runs the gambit so I'm going to break it up into sections.

For me collecting watches I feel the movement is half of the watch and I do enjoy having watches with different movements 

If you could only have one watch that you had to rely on what movement would you choose? Assuming the watch would have a hard life, be worn every day and the only maintance if lucky maybe some oil.

And this is assuming that the movement was made in spec and properly lubed and demagnetinzed, regulated when made plus the case is well made with good gaskets a thick crystal and screwdown crown no display back and maybe even some type of anti-magnetic iron covering on the case back and dial.

As for  holders it could be solid metal, plastic, I'm not sure if I have ever seen a movement ring that's supposed to give some wriggle room or give but that could be a possibility.

I guess the specs would be if you had to make 1 watch that's an automatic and it would have to survive a very long and hard life, I have heard of daily driver watches never being serviced before and the person just adjusting the speed so it could still roughly tell the time but In all of these cases the movement is not being made anymore.

Maybe you can sometimes oil it but can't rely on swapping out the movement or getting new parts.

I will break the autos down by nation and 3hz /4hz (I know Vostok is not 3 but I will put it in the 3l

chinese 3hz, so many if then are made but the majority seem to be a mix of miyota clones or miyota clones with Seiko magic lever.
I don't own an automatic Tongji but in China I found a couple of nice 17 and 19 jewel tonji watches made in the 70s, I got them serviced for a low price and Im pressed by how well they run but I don't think they make good quality ones anyone let alone autos.

I did buy a freind a watch with a Mingzhu 3 hand no date movement (it was when I went to Guangzhou watch market before NH35/6s movements flooded the market as before that it was miyota, some real and some fake orient, some real and some fake ETA  then the mingzhu movements that looked and operated a lot like miyota 8s but they had GMTs, and pretty much all rolex looking complicstions apart from chronos.
I don't even know if china makes a 3hz chronic apart from the ST19.


Anyway it's been over 10 years and he had been wearing that watch every day and one time I changed the gaskets and adjusted the speed for him, maybe it was a lucky find no idea.

Russian movements.
Not sure if Vostok provides 3rd party but they did.  I do like QCd Vostok movements as they can be accurate, they have alot of jewels and I love the sound a 18900bph watch makes. It's nearly as nice as a 18,000bph 

I know Vostok makes some bad movements with low QC but no idea since the war but before the war they where starting to improve .

I have managed to get my prewar Vostok running within COSC but not sure if that's just dumb luck,  I just went with a nice 090 case and classic dial with no date, modified the spring so it was tight and put in a cut to fit sharkmesh.

In the instruction manual it says to get it serviced every 10 years...


Japanese movements.

Old 21/22J Seiko movements without hacking and handwinding (I'm not sure but maybe most are made in Japan and some movements can still be found and also cheap watches with the movement but a movement that can't handwind can be a problem.

I know that ever since TMI took over or changed names the Seiko NH30 movements I don't think any are made in Japan anymore and I guess they are all made in Malaysia and maybe a part of china not to far away from HK but wages in HK are a little high. Maybe in HK if little human work is needed.

I have only had 1 NH30 movements come Dead on arrival the rest have been fine but I do wonder how the NH34gmt will stack up as I think I remember reading that Seiko said something about maybe the date/GMT swinging arm if the NH34 needs some oil every 2 years, not sure.

But when sii made movements I sold both Japanese Seiko and non Japanese and with a lopupe and timograph I could not realy tell any difference at all even the machining marks looked the same and on the timograph they seemed to be the same.

But it seems TMI are putting prices higher by about 40 or 50rmb per movement in bulk

Making them more expensive than the Japanese made miyota 82xx, maybe the cost of the 83xx is similar  and so will the Japanese made s.epson YN55 / 6  (orient F6)

With movements like the Miyota 8215 I have had good luck especially with accuracy and find that I can regulate them better than a NH30

Not sure about the bi-directional winding efficiency but piling the rotor bearing seems to go a long way every couple of years, ok the pre hacking watches I could backhaxk them and ok the new ones they hack but.

It's nice they have a version with extra power reserve but I know it's not direct seconds drive and some people have said they have problems with the seconds hand slipping.
Personally I have never seen this. Not sure if a subseconds dail would make it more reliable and robust 
They have been out a very long time but I have not owned one for so long so no idea.

The s.epson YN55/6  (F6 one with date the other with day date) to me I have allways preferred them over the 4r30 and I know many complain they are only 22j but I find them to be more accurate and the balance wheel seems to be more weel mwde with the haiesoeint beint quite hard compared to Seiko.

Out of the Japanese movements I did. The NH30s have the most positional variation.


Now going onto 4hz movements.

Chinese ETA clones.
I only bring this up as I have a Chinese HZ ETA 2824 25J clone movement in a watch and it's one of my most accurate movements, had it for nearly 6 years and no broken teeth or handwinding issuies and it's outperforming most ETA and Stellita top movements I have but maybe I got lucky.

HKPT5000 seems good but with seagull sometimes they have no lube at all and with peacock wellnit has a bad name.

Then it seems like Hangzhou are making some micro microrotor 4hz movements I know the original HZ5000 had a subseconds but they now have a new one with central seconds and a date but no idea if it's a direct drive.

But the 7000 series as in the 21j 4hz 70hr power reserve movements with most Rolex complications.
Dandong also makes a similar movement but it seems the 7500 was used in a production watch and it ran pretty well.

While these movements are mostly made so fingers can make Rolex clones maybe if they put a micro adjustment on them, you the jewel count maybe and go with a standard available and size and dial type like maybe ETA style it could be a good movement.


The Miyota 9000 series. Just for example I feel movements like the 9015 and 9039 are really good, they are relatively new movements and in sure they have made heavy use of computer design, more modern materials and oils while being a 4hz movement that's thinner than the 2824 and has no hand widing issuies.

I'm sure oiling the rotor will help but as far as accuracy is concenered I have been told when regulated it's better than a basic ETA 2824-2 / Stellita      it would have been nice if they put a microadjsutment screw on but I think miyotas plans to be a huge player for what would be potential ETA customers is paying off.
Also they have a nice 9075gmt with jumping hours.

It also seems that citizen has invested in MJLP and some of the movements they make just seem to be miyota 9000 movements but with more decoration. A micro adjust speed screw and I think they are supposed to be drop ins for 2824-2s so ETA dail not sure if they have a uni-directional rotor but they seem to be quite expensive.

STP movements I have no idea, some people have said they are seagull movements assembled in Switzerland but I did not like the look of the GMT movement they make as in a factory 2836gmt, it put me off wanting to get a Zodiak and they seem to be owned by the fossil group.


I have no idea about 4hz 3d party TMI but they seem to be expensive and it seems that soprod movements use some Seiko tech but I have no idea how good they are, maybe their version of the 2824 has no handwinding issuies but it seems alot of people who used to use them dropped them due to servicing issues or no one being able to service them.

As for kennisis Im not sure if you can call them a 3rd party manufacturer as sure they supply movements to 5 or more brands even a fashion brand and some talk of in the future maybe they will sell 3rd party but maybe not as good.

I'm not sure if having a a free-spring balance would be better for reliability and being uontonhabdle abuse but I have a few friends who purchased Tudor watches and one was running slow and the other stopped. Both went to get serviced by Tudor and they send them back movements with different serial numbers ( one ended up getting a refund) this was a while ago so no idea what they are like now.


ETA.

While an ETA was my second auto movement  I do prefer ETA 2824-2 movements over Stellita SW200-1 movements, have had problems with both.

I have no idea about the handwinders like on the Hamilton field khaki

But I have a pre-coaxial omega with a 23j 2892  and it's a great movement.

But my most accurate movements is a Stellita SW330-2 (it has about 57 hours or power reserve a clone of the 2893) and since the standard 2892/3 movements have 21 jewels I doubt it effects performance maybe omega just put 2 extra jewels on to make it sound fancy but Stellita added 4 jewels to I think the arbour snd mainsping, it seems Stellita adds jewels to most movements but maybe it's not a complete waste on the 2893/3

No handwinding issuies they wind nicely and the SW330-2 setting the time date and GMT hand just feels tighter and better than a friend's 2893

So if you had to choose an auto movement 3rd party what would you choose and if you had the option of going ""in house"" or using a movement not in production but you could find a vintage one in good condition  what would you choose.




As for quartz are 3rd party solar from miyota or s.epson any good?

My first adult sized watch when I was 9 had a miyota 3 hand quartz movement with date and a 10 hour battery life.
Now they are discontinuing these movements and I think maybe some Swiss ,3rd party have 8 hours but I have only changed the battery once it lasted well over 10 years and the battery that is in it is at around 10 years but I did put a slightly bigger battery inside as it's all I had.

But I have noticed that both miyota and smepson are selling solar quartz movements 

The Miyota is just a simple 3 hander, I have no idea how good they are but I was told in the past an eco drive should last around 30 years if charged regularly but the capacitor / battery will eventually need to be changed.

Has any more advancements come with solar quartz (apart from IC, Bluetooth and such like I have seen on some Casio watches)

“Bring us in closer,” Captain Monica Guest ordered. “Dead slow. Come to three-ten by fifteen. Stealth fields at max.”

“Aye, ma’am. Three-ten by fifteen at dead slow,” the *Vanguard* Class destroyer TFN *Resolute’s* Helmsman, Lieutenant Justin Portnoy, answered.

The destroyer had exited hyper two hours before, carefully scouting around the edge of the star’s hyperlimit. For the past twenty minutes, they had worked their way closer to the newly discovered Vredeen system, HD 3444. They’d heard that the scoutship *Valiant* had found the enemy system, but Fleet wanted hard details.

“Keo, what do you see?” Guest relied on her Tactical Officer’s ability to massage data from their sensors. She was better at it than most.

“Skipper, it looks like there are twelve planets,” Lieutenant Sia Keo highlighted the third and fourth planets. “Two in the Goldilocks zone. Both have a lot of orbital infrastructure. Designate it as Tango One. Thousands of ships at Tango One and at least twelve, what look like battle stations. I have ten solid hits on battleship sized ships. Another fifty in the cruiser range. The rest are smaller. I don’t have a hard count on them yet, but there are over two hundred.

“Tango Two is on the far side of the sun. We can’t get a great reading on it, but it has somewhere between one-eighty to over two hundred warships. There are twelve battleships and fifty cruiser types. They have their small ships in a shell around the heavies, but they are all running silent. Their drives are hot, but not active. Honestly, in this muck, we are lucky to have caught them at the range we did.”

“Skipper, I am getting some odd readings,” Keo said.

“Go ahead.”

“Those battleships are covering something. It’s hard to read… but I think there are some Federation ships in there.”

“Come again,” Guest ordered.

“I have at least one for sure but as many as three Federation drive signatures. They are damaged. I have broad antineutrinos emissions and negative beta decay.”

“Mag bottle generator damage,” the *Resolute’s* chief engineer, Yngve Isaksen, said. “It is not containing the antimatter effectively. Let me see the data, please.”

“On your screen,” Keo said.

Isaksen and her damage control chief both grabbed the data and ran diagnostic analysis. Chief Petty Officer First Class Eric Perkins had more than twenty years’ experience patching up damaged power cores. He had pretty much seen it all.

“That,” Perkins pointed to one icon, “is a damaged Koeningwerks FG-60-Alpha power plant. I would bet money on it. That is only on Alliance *Gwydion* Mark III class frigates, and there’s not many left in the fleet. We have been upgrading the Gwyds to Mark IV for the past several years. Part of the upgrades are new powerplants to drive the bigger forcebeams.”

“Only four *Gwydions* have not been upgraded, “Keo confirmed. “The *Ajax, Daedalus, Ōmononushi*, and *Prometheus*. Out of those, only the *Ōmononushi* is unaccounted for. She was listed missing in action three years ago.”

“That solves that mystery,” Guest said. “Now we know they capture enemy ships.”

“Contact!” Keo called. “Designate Bogey One. At three million kilometers. It is sneaking up our skirt.”

Her term was common slang for a ship flying in a target’s blind spot directly aft, generated by their drive.

“Talk to me, guns. What is it?

“Destroyer range. It is coasting dead slow with stealth fields fully active. I only caught it because I’ve been leaving breadcrumbs.”

Breadcrumbs being slang for dropping powered down recon probes in a ship’s wake. Without other ships covering their ass, scouts did it as a habit. Without active drives and relying on passive sensors only, these recon probes were black holes in space.

“I found a nice grav eddy to hide in” Guest said. “Come to two-ten by negative thirty. Cut the drive and coast.”

“Aye, coming to two-ten by negative thirty. Drive on standby and coasting ballistic,” Portnoy replied.

“Battle stations,” Guest’s orders were met with the ship’s klaxon sounding and the bridge lights changing to red. “Suit up, folks. Spool up the shields. I want them ready if we need them. If you see any offensive activity, don’t wait on me to order them up.”

“Aye,” Keo answered.

The destroyer coasted on its new course as the silent bridge crew went to battle stations. Her executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Karl Spano, jogged onto the bridge, hastily sealing his combat suit. As the second watch bridge crew joined them, her bridge crew managed to get into their combat suits and get back to work.

Spano joined her, and as was his wont, he did not ask her directly what had occurred, simply dropping into the network with his dataport and absorbing the situation.

The captain looked at her number two and quirked an eyebrow questioningly. The XO normally had the Auxiliary Command at the opposite end of the ship.

“Lieutenant Ackley’s team has the AuxCom,” Spano advised. Ackley was the third watch commander. “I was in the mess eating. It was faster to get here.”

“If we need AuxCom, we are already dead,” Guest said softly.

The tension ratcheting up with every passing minute. The small holotank at the center of the bridge showed their immediate surroundings. Every five minutes, Keo dropped another recon probe. The string of green dots hung behind them like Christmas lights.

“Battle stations are fully manned, Captain,” Spano announced.

“Thank you, XO. Set condition one.”

“Aye, set condition one.”

He ordered the crew to seal their suits and helmets. When his board read that all crew statuses were green, he initiated atmospheric purge. As the ship reached vacuum, he said, “We are at condition one.”

“Contact! Confirm Bogey One. Enemy ship is coming up on our starboard. Range three point six million klicks.” Keo’s call came almost twenty minutes after their course change.

“Come to two-eighty-five by fifty,” Guest ordered.

“Aye. Course change to two-eighty-five by fifty,” Portnoy confirmed. “Skipper, this course is taking us closer to the enemy ships.”

“I know,” Guest said. “In five minutes, we will change course zero by negative fifty.”

“Change course to zero by negative fifty in…” He checked the chrono, “four minutes forty-five seconds.”

Guest watched the chrono count down and at the five minute mark, Portnoy said, “Altering course now.”

“What do you see, Keo?” Guest asked.

“It mirrored our course previous course change, skipper. I can’t see it, but they must have a drone shell out. Probably had them out all along. It’s what I would do.”

“Skipper, we should launch a couple of decoys. Send one port and up and the other starboard and down and we just keep coasting in silence,” Spano advised.

“Make it three, XO. The third one will pull a wide starboard loop and try to come up behind the bogey. Perhaps we can convince them we are trying to get up their skirt.”

“Aye, skipper.” Her XO immediately worked on her orders. “Decoys away.”

“Guns,” Guest ordered, “no further probe drops, please. I don’t want anything to betray our position.”

“Aye. No probe drops.”

“Good sensor reads on the decoys,” Spano said. “Not enough to fool one of our ships but hopefully enough to fool them.”

“Lost contact with the bogey,” Keo said. “It dropped off our breadcrumb probes. If we don’t drop more, I cannot guarantee we can pick them up.”

“Not just yet,” Guest replied. “Probes are hard to spot but their launches aren’t. We are just another hole in space.”

“Right, another hole in space,” Keo said. “Just coasting along as another hole in space.”

“Decoy one is offline,” Spano said. “And there goes decoy two.”

“Destroyed?” Keo asked, “I didn’t see any weapons fire.”

“There goes decoy three,” Spano said.

“Contact. Bogey One is back on our tail. Look like he didn’t bite on the decoys,” Keo said.

“Then what killed them?” Portnoy wondered aloud.

“I had no sign of missile launches from the bogey,” Keo said. “And they are too far away for energy weapons.”

“Then we have at least two more bogeys out there,” Guest said. “Maybe, hell, likely more.”

“No wonder they are following us so easily. They have us boxed in.” Spano said. “Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this.”

“You and I, both, XO. We will probably have to shoot our way out of this. And I have no illusions about our ability to take on multiple destroyers and win. Our only advantage is shields don’t work in hyper. So, if we can get into hyper, they are just as vulnerable to hits as we are.”

“We need to find these other ships,” Spano said. “They already know we are here, ma’am. We might as well launch a large spread of probes and have them go active.”

“Come to three-fifty-two by thirty. Increase power by twenty percent,” Guest ordered.

“Aye, coming to three-fifty-two by thirty. Power increased by twenty percent,” Portnoy confirmed.

“Keo, give us two spreads, four by four. Wide dispersion.”

“Aye. Two spreads. Four by four, distribution intervals set for two million kilometers,” Keo answered. The pattern launched, and within four minutes, sixteen drones spread in a grid pattern with two million kilometers between each. Keo highlighted them as orange circles in the holotank.

“Thank you, lieutenant,” Guest said absently as she stared intently at the small display floating in the middle of her bridge.

“Come to ten by negative ten, maintain speed.”

“Aye,” Portnoy replied, “coming to ten by negative ten, maintaining speed.”

“Contact. Designating as Bogey Two,” Keo called. “bearing one-three-three by fifty-two at two point four million kilometers.”

“Keep an eye on our port flank,” Spano said. “If I had to guess we will see one at two-three-zero by negative fifty. That’s where a ship would need to be to take out decoy two. And it would give them three ships spread in a line, driving us where they want.”

“Contact! Dead ahead. Zero by fifteen,” Keo called. “Designate Bogey Three. Range one point three million kilometers. No active emissions. I was lucky that the grav eddies out here fluctuate so much. I got a clear image.”

“We make our own luck,” Guest said. “Let’s pretend we don’t see it. When we get within half a million kilometers, I want a double spread of missiles, then go to flanks speed and a full broadside from the force beams as we pass. We will get one shot at this. Make it count.”

“Aye, double spread at half a million,” Keo replied.

“Aye, maximum power at launch,” Portnoy added.

“Then a full energy broadside,” Spano said. “And God be with us.”

“Seven million… six million… firing,” Keo said.

“Flank speed,” Portnoy said.

The *Resolute’s* ten launchers spat two missiles apiece. Keo had the missile drives set to full power. Less than two seconds later, the missiles impacted. Antimatter met matter in eye tearing explosions. And a second later, the *Resolute* flew past, raking the enemy with forcebeams. The Bogey Three was left an atmosphere bleeding wreck.

“Vampire!” Keo called. “Incoming missiles. Designate Bogey Four!”

The young tactical officer had prepared for this, and immediately the *Resolute’s* defenses spun up. Anti-missiles flashed out and invisible forcebeams speared at the incoming fire. She got six out of nine. A sixty-six percent interception rate was incredible for such a short window.

The three missiles impacted the destroyer. It knocked down their shields, and nuclear fire tore into the hull, stripping away armored plating. The bridge bucked and heaved. Energy spiked through the power runs and sparks sprayed from control stations.

Guest looked around, her ears ringing from the impact. Keo was hunched over her station, still fighting the ship. Countermissiles fired back at all incoming fire.

“Damages,” she yelled.

“Missile one and two are gone,” Chief Perkins answered. “Beam three and four are gone, five is damaged and under local control. We are open decks two and three from frame twenty to frame twenty-eight. Fusion one is on emergency shut down.”

“Get on it, Chief,” Guest ordered. The senior chief petty officer headed back to lead the damage control crews. The captain looked for her chief engineer and found Lieutenant Isaksen slumped over her console. Spano was already there, checking the injured woman’s suit telltales.

“Medic to the bridge,” the XO called.

“Talk to me, Guns,” Guest yelled.

“I took a snapshot with what we had left. No joy. We caught Bogey Three napping but this one was prepared.”

“Keep firing with what you have. Helm, roll us one-eighty and come to twenty by minus fifty.”

“Aye captain,” Portnoy replied. “Rolling one-eighty and coming to twenty by minus fifty.”

“Break port,” Lieutenant Keo called.

Lieutenant Portnoy didn’t reply, just heeled the entire ship thirty degrees to port. The enemy missile that had broken past her defenses flew past them and detonated ten thousand kilometers off the starboard bow. The explosion threw spears of hard radiation at the destroyer that hit like titanic hammers, but they mostly missed them.

Sparks flew from the holotank emitters, and the entire system crashed, forcing the crew to work entirely from their workstations.

“Sorry, skipper,” Keo said.

“No need to apologize, Lieutenant. You are doing great,” Captain Guest replied.

The captain turned to Spano and said, “XO, what’s the damage?”

“Life support is down. Fusion one crashed again but Ensign Burke is on it. LIDAR two is glitching. Sending Chief Teterev there now.”

“Come to thirty by ten,” Guest ordered. “XO, full spread of decoys and jammers.”

“We only have five decoys left, Captain,” Spano replied.

“Spend them. We need to break contact.”

“Got the bastard,” Keo called out triumphantly.

Guest checked and saw that Bogey Three was no longer on the plot. “Good shooting, Guns. Take out Bogey Four. It’s trying to herd us towards their fleet.”

“Aye, ma’am. Going after Bogey Four,” Keo answered.

The incoming fire dropped significantly with the destruction of Bogey Three. But the enemy had three more ships. The remaining enemy ships put out four times more missiles than the *Resolute*. Guest was amazed that the young tactical officer handled the defenses so adroitly.

“Decoys and jammers away,” Spano said. “I am keeping the decoys in tight, flying barrel rolls before I split them off.”

“When we split them off, we will cease missile fire,” Guest said. “Otherwise we give our position away. We will execute in twenty seconds. Portnoy, on my command, come to sixty-five by thirty.”

“Aye,” both Keo and Portnoy said simultaneously. Spano simply nodded as he programmed the decoy and jammer’s flight paths.

“Five… four… three… two… execute,” Guest ordered.

The ship broke away. The steady thump of missiles firing ended. On her small command screen, she watched the decoys speed away, dancing and weaving while the jammers turned local space into an electromagnetic and gravitic hash.

“Skipper, the magazines are running low,” Keo advised. “Down to thirty percent. We can’t fight much more.”

“Agreed,” Guest said. “Portnoy, Get us out of the gravity well. We are going to do a crash translation as soon as we get clear.”

“Skipper, we might not survive that,” Spano said.

“We damn sure won’t survive more of this,” Guest said. “Life support, fusion one and gravity are already down. We have casualties and wounded we can’t get to. This is it. Time to roll the dice.”

“Skipper, they didn’t bite on the decoys,” Keo called. “The jammers did some good. Seems they couldn’t get a target lock on us.”

“How the hell are they seeing through our decoys?” Spano wondered aloud.

“Well, that settles it. Portnoy, redline the drive. We need to get further out of the well and drop out of hyper as fast as possible. Bradford, phone home. Let Fleet know what we know.”

“Aye, ma’am,” both officers replied in unison.

The ship’s speed increased to its maximum speed. A full fifteen percent faster than flank speed, which was the fastest a ship could travel safely. Fifty seconds until crash translation.”

Guest keyed her comm to all hands broadcast. “Attention. We will execute crash translation in thirty seconds. All hands prepare for… some bad shit.”

Spano looked surprised. He had not once heard his captain speak that way. She chuckled at his expression. “You disagree?”

“No ma’am. I think ‘bad shit’ covers it pretty well. Though I never heard that in command school.”

Portnoy keyed the all hands broadcast, “Bad shit in seven… six… five… four…”

“Wait, Captain, check this out!” Keo yelled excitedly. “Hyper trace! Holy shit, it’s huge!”

The ship’s communications officer, Ensign Caitlyn Bradford, put the incoming communications on loudspeaker. “*Resolute*, this is Fleet Admiral Davis Pierre aboard the TFN *Conqueror*. We have it from here.”

“Davis Pierre?” Spano’s voice showed his confusion. “Davis Pierre retired as a commodore. I was with him at the Battle of Indus when I was the tactical officer on the battle cruiser *Intrepid*.”

Guest just looked at her XO and shrugged. She had no more idea what was going on than he did. She just felt relief that someone showed up to pull their ashes out of the fire.

“Captain, I have one huge, and I mean really fucking huge ship and… It’s IFF shows the TFN *Behemoth*. I see one hundred forty-three battleships, almost four hundred fifty cruiser types, fifty carrier types, and at least eight hundred other TFN ships that just dropped out of hyper. IFF designates them as the 31^(st) Fleet. And the… *Behemoth* just launched two hundred battleships, four hundred more cruisers and six hundred destroyers… All broadcasting TFN IFF codes. But none are on our database.”

“The Aglildai…” Guest whispered, before continuing louder. “Gotta be the Aglildai. But they were supposed to be in Sol to meet with the Prime Minister. It was on all the news feeds. And I have no idea where they scraped up the rest of the ships. That is at least half the Navy ships on this side of the Federation.”

“Missile launch! They are targeting our Bogeys. I have three hundred missiles per bogey inbound,” Keo yelled. “Fighter launch! At least six thousand fighters launched from the carriers.” Guest decided not to reprimand her for getting carried away. You could hardly blame her. And the *Resolute* was out of the fight.

“And that’s a hard kill on all three remaining bogeys,” Keo crowed triumphantly.

“Missile launch. Holy….. There are too many. The computer cannot process it all.”

The TFN fleet had roughly 79,000 missile launchers in each broadside. The launchers could spit out a missile at roughly one every thirty-two seconds. The smaller ships had less magazine space and ran dry faster than the heavies. But the fleet launched a total of about 4.5 million missiles in just under thirty-two minutes.

“Hell yeah! The Vredeen are screwed, ma’am,” Spano gloated. “It’s all over now but their dying.”

“Missile flight time is ninety-two minutes,” Keo told the bridge. “It looks like their fleet is retreating to their inhabited planets. That maximizes their defenses.”

“It won’t help them in the end.” Guest sounded like a college professor. Which made sense since she’d been an instructor at the Academy. “Defending a planet is much harder than you’d think. They are pinned where they are. Ships rely on their mobility, but they can’t leave, or they lose the planet. They’ve already lost their access to the system’s resources and manufacturing. So… They will run out of missiles eventually.

As their magazines ran dry, the fleet fell back and popped into hyperspace where the fleet train and ammo colliers waited to resupply. As each ship was topped off, they dropped back into n-space. But they waited until all the fleet was ready before launching again.

“You don’t know the half of it, Captain,” Keo announced. “A second fleet just dropped out of hyperspace on the other side of the system. Two hundred plus battleships with over fifteen hundred more of the smaller types. And… They are not all Federation ships. There are Onami, Kifful and Mepthofu ships, too. Not a lot, only about two hundred cruiser class ships each, but… We’ve never had them assist us like this before. This is a game changer.”

“We’ve run anti-piracy patrols with them before,” Guest mused. “And we’ve had good relations with them for years. I worked with one of the Kifful squadrons about five years ago when I was weapons officer on the battlecruiser *Lochaber*. They helped us find the Mans--.”

“The who?” Keo asked.

“Ah, um. Forget about it. It’s top secret still. Seriously. Forget about it,” Guest ordered. “It will just cause you trouble.”

“Forget what, ma’am. I have no idea what you are talking about,” Keo said with a smile.

“Good girl.”

“Captain, we’re being hailed,” Bradford interrupted.

“On screen.”

An image popped up in her commander’s holotank, showing a tall, thin woman with commander rank pins and intensely severe looks.

“Captain Guest, I am Captain Chandler of the fleet repair ship *Integrity*. I have four heavy tugs and a shuttle full of damage control techs and medics heading your way. We’ll get you up and running as fast as humanly possible.”

The woman turned her head, and her features softened, “Hello, Karl. I am glad to see you are okay. I really wasn’t looking forward to breaking the bad news Jake and Erica if you’d been killed.”

“Good to see you too, Meiko,” Spano replied. “And I understand, I don’t want to be dead. But the risk is part of my job. The pointy end of the stick takes the most damage.”

“Understood. But I have to let you know. We’re grandparents. Erica and Dane had a little girl… Karla. I’ll send pictures.”

Guest kept her face neutral. As a rule, she never pried into her crew’s personal lives unless it had an impact on the mission. She knew Karl had kids and was divorced, but never knew who his ex-wife was, or that she was Navy, too. But that made sense. The Navy can be tough on marriages.

“Thanks.” Spano had a slightly bemused smile as he spoke. “I didn’t expect them to name her after me. I thought they’d name her after your mom.”

“Oh, they did,” Chandler paused with a mischievous smile. “They wanted to surprise us, and boy did they. Karla was born seven minutes before her identical twin sister, Lindsey.”

“Twins?” Spano sat back in his chair and shook his head. “Twins… I guess I need to take some leave when we get back… Twins…”

“We’ll meet up later, when all this is over, Karl.”

“Yeah.”

“Chandler out.” The feed cut and the bridge crew all looked at the XO with wide smiles.

“Congratulations, sir,” Keo said first. “Twins? That’s awesome.”

“You are on the first ship back home,” Guest announced. She held up a hand to stop her XO’s automatic reaction to say no. He was dedicated to the ship and his job. “We’re going to be out of action for months. We can spare you for a bit. Go see your grandkids. You almost didn’t get the chance.”

“Yes, ma’am… Thanks.”

“The Aglildai ships are docking with the *Behemoth*,” Keo commented. “God that thing is huge. When we heard about it, I didn’t believe it. But… damn.”

The bridge crew were spectators to the battle. Their fight was done. Spano checked the ship’s schematics, going over the battle damage and checking how many of their people were still trapped. Their damage control team was top notch, and they didn’t need his meddling or interruptions.

“Look how quickly they docked,” Guest mused. “It’s what, just over five minutes and their entire fleet is docked. That’s damned impressive.”

“I am just glad they are on our side,” Spano murmured.

“What the-? The *Behemoth* just dropped into hyperspace,” Keo yelped.

“This deep in the gravity well?” Spano asked.

“But that’s impossible,” Guest replied.

“And it just dropped out of hyper just inside planet six’s orbit. That’s inside both the solar and planetary gravity wells. That had to have fried their hyperdrives.” Spanos’ voice echoed the bridge crew’s confused awe.

Human ships could not do this without serious damage. It just highlighted the technological gap between humans and their new allies.

 

 

“Admiral Pierre, the *War Eagle* just popped into hyper.” His new communications officer, Commander Walter Tremaine, said in almost robotic voice. “The *Resolute* has taken enemy fire and is severely damaged. I have the full data packet for you.”

Since their victory at Indus, he’d decided not to go back into retirement. That decision had led to his latest promotion. He was still rather bemused at being jumped directly to Fleet Admiral and given command of the freshly minted 31^(st) fleet, even if it was just a temporary promotion. But he doubted it would be a temporary promotion if his plans succeeded.

The fact that the Aglildai specifically asked for him to command the human forces in this attack had surprised him. They knew Oliver but not him. And more, Admiral Halsey requested to not have overall command. He specifically wanted Davis in charge.

*Perhaps it was an optics thing*, he thought with a mental shrug.

“Call the fleet to battle stations,” he ordered. “We are going in. Attack plan Cupcake Three.”

“Aye, sir,” Tremaine replied. “Fleet to battle stations, attack plan Cupcake Three. All ships confirmed the order. Fleet is ready to drop out of hyper.”

He’d felt… uncomfortable with this plan. Sending in the *Resolute* without them knowing he had another ship farther out past the hyper limit watching was a tactical decision. If they’d been captured, they had no information to fall into enemy hands. But sometimes the commander had to make hard calls like this. Risking the destroyer to get intel would save more lives in the long run.

He looked around the flag bridge of the *Warrior* Class Battleship, TFN *Conqueror.* It was shiny and new, only two months out of its acceptance trials, and thirty-eight percent larger than the older *Volcano* Class battlewagons. It still had that new ship smell. He was almost jealous of Fleet Captain Dana Stutsman. She got to be this ship’s first CO. It was a privilege few captains got, and it only went to the best of the best.

His staff was a scratch built. He knew few of them personally, and some only by reputation. He was still learning them as much as they were learning him. But they were all solid people.

“Why did you pick ‘Cupcake’ for the plan, sir,” his chief of staff, the newly promoted Rear Admiral (Lower half) Kraig Kelce, formerly the commander of MEF 12’s naval component. Those ships now floated in space with the *Conqueror.*

“I had a dog when I was a kid. She was a Huskey mix. She was hyper as hell when she was a puppy but calmed down once she got older. But that dog was super sweet and loved people. I named her Cupcake. She was the best dog ever.”

“But why name the battle plan after her?”

“She was very protective of us,” Davis replied. “She squared off against a black bear once to keep it away from me and a couple of cousins. I had a rifle and bear spray, so we weren’t in any danger, but she didn’t know that. I miss that dog.”

“Ah. Translation in seven seconds.”

“Admiral Halsey, your people have point,” Davis ordered.

“Understood,” Halsey’s image floated in the smaller Admiral’s holotank. “We will, I believe your term is, ‘drop the hammer on them.’ They are in for a rude surprise.”

“Right you are. And you have such an impressive hammer.”

The fleet dropped out of hyperspace with the typical gut wrenching nausea. He heard an ensign in the tactical section retching violently. He’d grown used to it over the past thirty years. He looked at his staff roster. Ensign Alex Enckhausen would get used to it with time.

Once the ship’s computers and sublight drives stabilized from the hyperspace translation, the human ships shook out into squadron formations as the Aglildai launched their parasite fleet. Together, the formed a wall of starships, ready to launch missiles.

“Get me the *Resolute*,” Davis ordered.

“Aye sir,” his communications officer, Lieutenant Commander Bradley Van Zant, replied. “Audio only, sir.”

“*Resolute*, this is Fleet Admiral Davis Pierre aboard the TFN *Conqueror*. We have it from here.”

“I ordered the *Integrity* to head in and get the *Resolute*, sir,” Kelce said.

“Thank you. When this is over, I want to meet with Captain Guest personally. I owe her an apology.”

“I know Monica Guest, sir. We taught tactics at the Academy together seven years ago. She understands operational security.”

“Well, it will make me feel better.”

“Yeah, I guess making the Fleet Admiral happy is always a good thing.” Kelce’s smile robbed the comment of its sting.

As the *Behemoth’s* parasite warships launched, he still felt awe over their capabilities. The Aglildai said they had no fighter analogs. But when he thought about it, he realized the *Behemoth* is a carrier, and their entire fleet is fighter analogs, just writ large.

Outside of system defenses, it was the largest fighter forces the TFN had ever assembled at once, and every fleet and heavy carrier the navy had was here. A fighter division is two or more fighter groups under a unified command. A fighter group consists of four to ten wings. And a fighter wing consists of at least three to five squadrons. Each squadron has twenty seven fighters, with nine flights of three fighters each.

“Launch fighters,” Davis ordered.

Six fighter divisions crash launched from the fifty fleet and heavy carriers. It took less than five minutes, and they shook out in squadron formations.

 “Our mission is to destroy every piece of military equipment in this system. We will refrain from damage to civilian populations as much as we can, but our safety comes first. Open fire,” Davis ordered over the fleet’s all hands channel.

The fleet’s firepower was impressive. Battleships and cruisers carry larger missiles and have much larger magazines. The smaller ships may have smaller missiles and smaller magazine capacity, but they could cycle their launchers faster. For every two missiles from a battleship launcher, frigates, destroyers, and corvettes launcher could fire three or four missiles.

The battle plans called for a wave of *Linebacker* missiles to lead the way in each wave, with the fleet’s missiles following, tucked in close. Though they’d been used in Ikenga, Intel thought that with the enemy fleet’s complete destruction, that the *Linebackers* would be just as surprising here as they’d been in their operational debut.

Davis hoped as much. It would make their mission easier and less risky on ships and personnel. Both of which were large concerns.

The fleet launched 4.483 million missiles in a total of thirty-one minutes, forty seconds. Of that total, four hundred thousand were Linebackers, five hundred thousand were jammers, spoofers, and decoys. Most of these were launched from the lighter ships. This allowed the heavier missiles to be the larger, more effective ship killers.

The six fighter divisions, with a total of six thousand, one hundred and four fighters, followed the missile strikes, like hungry wolves waiting to pick off wounded elk.

The second fleet only had sixteen hundred fighters, but they had eight hundred gunships. Instead of driving in, these ships spread out. Their threat had to be respected. The enemy could not ignore these ships and head out to engage the TFN main fleet. Even if the second fleet never fired a shot, they were doing exactly what was needed.

As the lighter combatants ran dry, they immediately dropped into hyperspace to rendezvous with the fleet train. Reloading them took much less time than the cruisers and battleships. When they were ready, they dropped back into the system, providing cover for their heavier brethren.

“Aglildai ships are Winchester, sir,” Tremaine’s voice cut through the background murmur of the flag bridge. “They are falling back to the Behemoth to dock and reload.”

“Admiral Halsey, as soon as your magazines are topped off, execute Dagger.”

“Yes, sir. Executing Dagger in ten minutes,” Halsey confirmed the order.

“You know, I never realized just how little a fleet admiral does in a battle. Most of my job was in the planning. I feel like a spectator. I wonder if Halsey feels the same way.”

“Probably. I wonder how their telepathy helps them in combat,” Kelce said. “It has to help. I mean, there is no way to misunderstand an order.”

“They do seem to operate with a precision we don’t, or can’t, match. They have most of their ships docked already.”

They watched the holotank as their huge wave of missiles as they sped to the inner system. Then the *Behemoth’s* icon disappeared as the massive ship went into hyperspace.

“Time to twist the dagger,” Davis mused. “Get me Admiral Horn, please.”

The image of Vice Admiral Bryan Horn appeared in his holotank. Horn’s last command was the *Vikrant* battlegroup at defense of Verdigris, in the Ikenga System.

Horn looked at his chrono on his wrist before saying, “Good morning, sir.”

Every ship had its own internal clock. While it was 1530 hours on Horn’s command ship, the *Volcano* Class missile battleship TFN *Atitlán*. It was 0900 hours aboard the Conqueror.

“Good afternoon. Admiral, it’s time. Execute Damocles,” Davis ordered.

“Aye, sir. I think Damocles Six would be best.”

Davis had known Horn for years. While they had never been friends, they respected each other. If Horn held any resentment or reservations being under the command of a recently unretired and rapidly promoted CO, he didn’t show it. In the planning phases, Davis had let Horn and his team come up with their battle plans with very little interference.

“Damocles Six it is. I’ll let you get to it. Godspeed. Pierre out.”

Horn cut the feed with a predator’s smile. He held a deep grudge against the Vredeen, but he was also experienced enough to not let that affect his judgement in battle.

The plan for Horn’s fleet, designated 27^(th) Fleet, was to attack the fourth planet, which was on the far side of the sun. The 27^(th) was made up of missile battleships, missile cruisers, carriers, destroyers for defense, and cargo ships.

The Onami, Kifful and Mepthofu ships were all specialized missile defense ships. They tucked in tight to the human missile heavy warships. They only totaled five hundred and eighty-seven ships. But that allowed the 31^(st) Fleet more TFN anti-missile defensive ships.

These cargo ships were loaded with four thousand Jericho drone minelayers, each loaded with two hundred missile batteries that mount twenty battleship class missiles.

The 27^(th) had launched these incredibly stealthy drones as soon as they dropped out of hyperspace. In the past forty minutes, they’d coasted on ballistic at their top speed, which was much faster than a manned ship could maintain.

Damocles Six was the one of their preplanned battle options. It meant the 27^(th) Fleet would move in to engage at long range, waiting one the Jericho drones to reach knife fighting range before opening fire. When they did, sixteen million missiles would strike the enemy defenses from a different direction than either of the two fleets the enemy could see, and at such short range, their defenses would be unable to react effectively.

That plan went hand in hand with Cupcake Three. The 31^(st) Fleet’s target was the third planet, and they’d dropped from hyperspace as close as they could. That gave their missiles the fastest time to target.

The *Behemoth’s* icon reappeared, further into the combined solar and planet six’s gravity wells than any human ship could manage. Within minutes, the Aglildai parasite warships launched and started attacking the orbital foundries and factories.

While there might be civilians working those in these facilities, they were legitimate military targets. And the fact that the Vredeen had no compunction about killing human civilians, it was hard for the humans to feel sorry for them. And the Aglildai just didn’t care. In their worldview, targets were targets. And targets got destroyed. It was just that simple.

“Admiral, the 31^(st) Fleet is assembled. We are locked and loaded, ready to go,” Kelce announced. “Just give the word.”

“Fleet orders, the word is given. Attack. I don’t want a single piece of spaceborn industry left intact. I don’t want a single spacecraft left. When we leave, we don’t leave anything that can be used against us. This system is going to be a junkyard. It’s time to get some back.”

“Aye, sir. A junkyard it will be,” Kelce replied grimly.

Just then, they heard a voice over the all hands channel, a voice they did not recognize, sing, “A hunting I will go, a hunting I will go, hi-ho the dairy oh, a hunting I will go.”

Looking around the bridge crew, Davis chuckled and said, “Gotta be a fighter pilot.”"

*By writer Roc Hatfield*

The ambassador's vessel is capable of traveling as an Aetherian vessel or changing into a Matterverse vessel if needed, along with Matterverse corporeal bodies to dwell in. Elo-Eloahim, Old Dominion, is written on the side of the jewel-like vessel. Eloahim is an ancient reference to the One.

All Aetherians are thought to be immortal, but ancient texts found in the Acacia to the Hall of Records allude to Eloahim as the One, the first Aetherian. All Aetherians are sons of Eloahim, an eternal copy of the Father. When Aetherians have a call for the One, it is Eloahim bringing back all the pieces of himself as the One.

Ambassador Lucientel finishes his briefing with the salutation, All power and glory be with the One. 

https://preview.redd.it/rb0am7cryn0e1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8782bcbbda80a49e9111a1b7b9c51d584bcb733

Brad left his cozy suite and has worked his way up to the large hangar that sits over the massive underground pine-bluff base. He sees crews making ready one of the big black triangles.

The pilot and his commander walk up to greet Brad. Captain Carpenter pulls up in a shiny golf cart and joins Brad, and the two pilots. The pilot offers his hand, Mr. Hilliard, I am Major John West of the Black Manta Wing stationed here at Pine Bluff, and this is my second-in-command Olsen Tyndale.

Barbara jumps in. Brad, Major West, and his crew will be flying you to the pickup site, and they will support you in moving what gear you need. OK, Brad nods.

A strange noise, like air from an air hose, fills the hangar. They are speaking loud now in order to be heard. That's the Mercury Taurus engines revving up.

That's 1,000 pounds of mercury spinning at 200,000 RPM. It can get loud until the mercury warms up. Then it's pretty quiet, says the Major.

Come on, let's get you suited up and settled aboard the ship. Two techs help Brad slip into his flight suit and climb up into the big black craft. Major West and his wingman step into the pilot seats and begin flipping toggle switches and adjusting levers.

As Major West goes through his checklist, Brad is putting on his headset and asks, Can anybody hear me? Loud and clear, the Major says. A small unmanned tow truck pulls the Black Manta out of the hangar and onto the tarmac. The loud hissing sound has been replaced with jet engine sounds.

There are four small jet engines at each corner of the craft, and four in the center. The jets assist the Taurus engines that cancel about 90% of the craft's weight. The jets lift the rest and provide forward thrust, explains Major West.

The Black Manta is a space elevator. She can fly subsonic like a regular jet, but her real talent is being able to lift very heavy payloads into Earth orbit. She flies straight out and comes right back down.

We can then turn around and go right back up within hours, the Major concludes. So, very impressive Major, Brad says. OK, sit back and relax. We will be at the coordinates that you provided in an hour or so. Your flight attendant will be by soon to get your drink order. And once again, thank you for flying Black Manta Air.

Walter and Nancy are crawling down a bumpy service road along a tree line out on Walter's brother's property. The big van moans and groans as Walter parks near the big open pasture. It's a clear moonlit night.

Out here far away from the city lights, you can see millions of stars. A beautiful night. Walter calls Brad on his burner phone.

Brad picks up. Walter, we good? Damn skippy, Walter replies. Brad holds the phone out at arm's length with a puzzled look on his face.

Walter, we need to move the superlight, the chip trays, and the tri-drive stacks. We can use all the processing power we will ever need where we are going, Brad says. So, where is that? Walter asks.

Pine Bluff Deep Underground Base. Oh, a dumbs? Walter responds. A very deep underground base, the place is amazing.

You will be very impressed, Brad says, hoping to calm nerves. So, what are you flying in, a Big Helo? Walter pries. No, not exactly, Walter.

Look for a big black triangle. Okay, Walter, see you in a few minutes. Brad hangs up.

Major West comes on the comm. You are going to like this, Brad. There are a good number of aircraft in the vicinity, so we are going full stealth.

We have an outer skin covered with thousands of small screens. Basically, cell phone screens, cameras on the opposite side of the craft project, the background onto the thousands of screens, and the result is we disappear to any visual observers. Anyone looking closely will only see a fuzzy outline of the ship, which is difficult to see from a distance.

Comes in handy if we are carrying secret hardware into space. Plus, the shape and predominantly all carbon fiber shell make us invisible to most advanced radar. Unbelievable, Brad says.

Hey, Major, will my folks see us on the ground when we land? Only when I turn the camo off. Cool, Brad snaps. We are coming up on the meet site right now.

I can see the van on the ground with the thermal system. Stand by. The Major announces.

A minute later and Brad can feel the big bird settle down. I will turn off the camo for a second, so they can see us and know they heard us. Go ahead and debark the craft.

I am going to turn the camo back on, just to be on the safe side. Roger that, Brad says. Brad quickly climbs down the little ladder that extends to the ground.

He can see Walter and Nancy and runs to greet them. They both have equipment they are carrying. Brad grabs a stack and they move it onto the Black Manta.

A big jacked up pickup truck bursts from the tree line and out onto the meadow, stopping just 20 yards from the Manta. Major West turns off the camo and the giant black triangle appears from nowhere. He then turns on the brightest lights the ship has.

The pickup backs up, all the way back to the tree line from where it came. Brad, we need to go. Everything on board? We good? Just about Major, Brad says out of breath.

The Major lifts the Black Manta 10 feet above the ground. West turns the lights off and flips on the camo and it looks like the giant ship just vanished. The pickup truck is just two hunters that stubbled out onto the meadow.

They watched the whole scene through the windshield of their truck. The driver asks, you want another drink, Bobby? The passenger reaches for the bottle. Now that's something you don't see every day, he says, as he takes a big swig.

A river of stars above and a river of stars below. The view from the command bridge of Excelsior, Andriel's blade ship, stretches out to infinity. A number of tall and small greys are seated at consoles operating the vessel.

They appear to be frozen in place, like a photograph. There is not one movement, no lights flashing, graphics changing, nothing. Everything is frozen in time.

The ship is now traveling outside the space-time field. Time is passing by so fast on the outside of the ship, making time almost imperceptible on the inside. One second is a hundred years.

This state only lasts for a few minutes while the ship is in trans-time mode. As she drops out of trans-time mode, the pace of activity returns back to normal speed. The blade has covered half the galaxy in a few minutes of trans-time.

The brane of the galaxy, as in the membrane that encloses the Matterverse, is only a day away in trans-time. The membrane enshrouds the entire Matterverse. The outer edge of all matter, beyond is nothing.

No quantum particles, quantum energy, anti-quantum energy, zip, nothing. You could theoretically fly the blade beyond the brain into the abyss. But it would slow down and come to a stop.

The quantum energy that powers the blade, not to mention the energy from the One that binds all things in existence, is gone. The blade would disappear into a cloud of energy. The void is a gulf that only the One can ever know.

Excelsior Andriel explains to his crew. Excelsior, we are in contact with the Elo Eloahim reports a crewman. Put them up on the main viewer,

the Excelsior says. A floor-to-ceiling window wraps around the front of the blade. From inside it looks as though you are standing in space.

The windows are actually video screens, now projecting Ambassador Lucientel. Be not afraid, power and glory to the One, Ambassador in the highest. The Excelsior announces.

Excelsior, may the One enrich and protect you. The standard greeting between dignitaries has been delivered. Ambassador Lucientel, what do we owe this true and rare pleasure? Andriel asks.

Please accept my invitation to join us here aboard the Elo Eloahim, a conference among Aetherians. I see you are wearing your corporeal robes. Please join us as brothers. The Ambassador requests. It would be a great pleasure and honor to join you, Ambassador. We will join you in one chronos.

As above, so below, says the Ambassador. The screen goes black, then as a giant window. 

Crews from the Black Manta flight wing are securing the returning Black Manta, the top-secret asset, is now safe in its underground hangar.

Brad, Walter and Nancy are greeted by Captain Carpenter. It's 6 a.m. Good morning, Brad. Good morning, Brad says.

This is Walter Abram and Nancy Carrington. They are the brains behind the Superlight. They led a team of about 1,400 hardware and software engineers to bring the Superlight into being.

Good to meet you both. I bet you never thought you would be riding on a top-secret space plane this morning. The Captain jests.

No, not in a million years. But it was awesome, Nancy says with a spark. You guys are famous, the news media are all over your story. And some rabbit hunters have reported encountering a UFO this morning. Barbara smiles as she delivers the news.

I am sure you all are exhausted. I'm going to send Airman First Class Johnson to escort you to the guest level and help get you settled in. Let's meet up at lunch.

I will have Airman Johnson escort you to the mess at noon. 

Brad flops down on his couch and turns on the TV. He finds a news network.

This is News Now. Good morning. I'm Tom Jennings.

The news around billionaire playboy Brad Hilliard and his struggling company continues to escalate. The company's chief medical officer Jason Anderson spoke last night about some of the strange experiments Hilliard and his science team were carrying out. Jason is speaking with a reporter.

Yes, I saw a very advanced technical device, a camera. When the device was pointed in the direction of a human, you could see a being, a spirit if you will, moving inside of them. It was a separate being moving in and out of the person.

Terrifying, actually. People are now calling the Superlight device. Spirit cam, now in other news.

Brad turns the TV off. Brad picks up the encrypted phone Barbara gave him and dials Jason's number. Jason sees it's a caller unknown number, but he answers anyway.

Hello, he says. Jason, how's it going, buddy? Brad asks. Brad, are you all right? Fine, Jason.

What about Walter and Nancy? Jason asks. Good, we are all good. Jason, I have been watching your interviews.

Great stuff. Spirit cam, very catchy. Hey, Jason.

Yes, he responds. You're fucking fired. Good luck and goodbye.

Brad hangs up. Brad immediately realizes who the traitor is, motherfucker, he says under his breath. 

Excelsior Andriel is standing in his private quarters. He is drinking water and eating some type of flat cracker. A ceremony he performs anytime he prepares to disrobe. A system of restraints are hanging in a closet.

He backs into the little closet and binds his waist, legs, and torso with the restraints hanging in the closet. He stands still, and the Aetherian that drives the body steps out and down onto the floor. Andriel prefers his corporeal robes over his natural Aetherean body, as do most Aetherians.

They find the visceral feelings of touch and solidity addictive. Andriel and his other now disrobed crew members move to the transportation debark site on the Blade."

Planet Eclipse LV1-1.5/LVR Solenoid Conversions,paintball,1goyuol,2024-11-11 13:12:07,31,0.94,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1goyuol/planet_eclipse_lv115lvr_solenoid_conversions/,NighthawkAquila,,"Hey everybody, I wanted to post another conversion that I recently did on an LVR. I was able to modify it to take the LV2 Solenoid. I'm actually not offering the conversions for the Ego 11 at this time as I want to fix the sealing on the solenoid manifold which will require testing out a few more design iterations. That said, I am now able to complete conversions on LV1.5 and LVRs (and probably the rest of the LV line).

[Completed LVR.6 Conversion](https://preview.redd.it/ex10hxh05b0e1.jpg?width=2283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a470b99eba30ca671660788ae3786a81560ee6d2)

  
**Manifold Design**

https://preview.redd.it/sumcqab9bb0e1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=becfa48ab886a4813b895892d1e0c7307dcb5fba

For this conversion, it uses an LV2 Solenoid, LV1.6/2 Manifold, LV1.6 Manifold Gasket, and LV1.6 Barb, in combination with the filter from your pre-existing LV Manifold. The Manifold requires milling to be done to it for it to fit on the frame, but it is still cheaper than the custom manifold required for the Ego 11 conversions.  


**Build Process**

There are a couple things to note on this conversion and for assembling the parts together.

1. I was able to bring down the price of this conversion from the Ego 11 since the LV line uses a longer manifold than the Ego 11 which allows me to actually modify the LV1.6/LV2 Manifold for use in the LV1 markers without needing to entirely machine a new one. As a result it will cost around **$250 plus shipping for a conversion which I can start offering immediately through DMs.**
2. The LV 1 series board sends out a 5V signal to the solenoid to operate. the Lv1.6/2 Solenoid is designed to operate at a range of 2.7-3.3V. I have built in a voltage step down to decrease the signal voltage from 5V to 3.3V to keep it in the normal operating range. I will be including this in any conversions to prevent overvolting the solenoid. This does however require me to mill out some space in the frame which you can see in the photos below with the step-down installed.
3. There is some milling of the frame that needs to be completed in order to prevent pressure on the solenoid which would cause it to bend away from the manifold and leak similar to the Ego 11. This is due to the increased height of the LV2 Manifold which is used in the conversion. Unfortunately, this does mean that the endmills used need to be treated as consumables due to the extreme stick-out required in order to mill the interior of the frame.
4. The LV1.6/2 Manifold does not fit in the marker on its own nor do the holes align with screw holes on the upper body of the marker. As a result of this, I needed to modify the manifold. Unfortunately, due to the unique geometry required, it does look a little bit odd, but it is fully functional. I do also deburr the milled area for the safety of whoever is servicing the marker.  

[LVR.6 Conversion Prior to Milling for Voltage Step-Down](https://preview.redd.it/32j95q9sbb0e1.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c166f03c4236c33eb0c5655cd7561974cf42ba4)

**Conversion Results and Key Improvements**  


* The marker shoots very much like an LV1.6, I don't entirely know how the LV1.5/LVR previously fired but I would imagine it was very similar and that there isn't much difference at all. 
* The conversion overall is a huge success in my opinion. I was able to take the marker to the field and chrono it at 285fps without any adjustments to the regulators or dwell settings from the owner who stated that it had been firing at 290fps previously.

[LVR.6 Chrono Results](https://reddit.com/link/1goyuol/video/myfiwiq29b0e1/player)

* One of the concerns from a tech that I had received was the operating voltages of the solenoids and the risk of damage due to overvoltage. I have contacted SMC and was able to get my hands on the technical data for the LV2 Solenoid. Their stated operating voltage for the SMC LV1.6/2 Solenoid is 3V ± 10% which is how I determined that the 5V to 3.3V step-down would be adequate to prevent damage.
* I also was able to take the conversion to the field and try it out. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough people playing speedball when I arrived (due to the World Cup taking place) for me to try it on that field. So instead I had to go play against walk-ons. But here is some of the footage from playing with it.

* Please pardon me running down the small child (I did aim for his pod pack), he had previously gotten a snap-shot on me pushing down their side of the field and I couldn't let that happen a second time."

Your first panel skill is only active when you reach 500 worship energy. Sacrifled basic units (Zealot, Adept, Stalker) to summon Ulrezaj Avatar for 16 seconds

Add one Ulrezaj Phantom in Altar

https://preview.redd.it/cc96lcgmwnzd1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b1f89120d8012931808712380ddc9f5938446a

To sum it up:

Ulrezaj Avatar. Grand 5 supplied, granted worship energy (mastery).His skill can only cast one. Had single skill, AOE skill, AOE channeling skill and teleport.

Because it’s very short of time. You must quickly cast Q, E then R then focus back to your units.

**Incarnation of Void** is the main skill that summons temporary Boss units to deal with good damage and grant One Phantom for multiple use. Used this skill ASAP as soon as you reach 500 energy

**Phantom Teleport**

Teleport one Phantom to the battlefield. Grand detector and power field where it’s land.

Good skill as a power field to reinforce and a detector It will only stay for 10 seconds so make use of it. 

**Shield of Void** 

Grant 200 shields in AOE for allied units in 10 seconds. 20% damage of the shield absorb will turn into energy 

A quick protection skill and worship energy generator, used this on every fight when you engage the enemy

**Finale**

Summon Ulrezaj into battlefield, Can only cast when you have seven Phantom. Consume all 7 Phantom

Ulrezaj is a big Boss that can solo every unit in the map, for brutal. He can use his skill freely, grant 200 supplies, and regeneration to allied units.

He can only stay in the battlefield for 60 second and must use this skill to prolong his duration

**Unification of All** ( V ) Cooldown: 12 Consume all Worship Power to restore Ulrezaj's shield equal to 200% of the Worship Energy consumed. For every 100 Worship Power consumed, Ulrezaj's duration is extended by 3 seconds. If 500 Worship Energy is consumed at once, this effect is doubled.

Explain: Grant Ulrezaj shield and prolong his duration, 

IE: 400 worship energy will turn into 12 seconds duration

500 worship energy will turn into 15 seconds duration.

But when you use 500 energy (Maximum) you grant an additional 15 seconds. So it’s best to use only 500 energy.

Additionally if you use **Unification of All** when 500 energy, produce one Phantom at the Altar.

With good map knowledge and enough enemies. You can turn Ulrezaj into Permanent Boss. Cast R, fulfill your energy cast V then teleport into every where in the map for kill and energy generation.

**Build Order**

14 Pylon

16 Warpgate

17 Gas

19 Gas

21 Core

After core 

2-3 Stalker, turn into Immortal break rock

Nexus

This build gives you 2-3 Immortals to deal with early wave and objects. You can start up form here

Alt build 

14 Pylon

16 Warpgate

17 Gas

19 Gas

19 Zealot x2

21 Core

Turn zealot into DT break rock.

This build is faster to break rock, give you 2 DT. But it’s more error prone.

You can miss the Core timing and your zealot returns to the void, wasting minerals, your DT is invisible  so enemy early waves will ignore you and attack your worker also.

Use this build if early aggressive is need (Void rift)

# 4) Play style 

    There is two main play style of Ulrezaj Main units focus and Ulrezaj worship
    
    
    
    **Main units focus**

https://preview.redd.it/kpluxgjownzd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=96ea8ac024bc5af7985fe8273c04bbc96a71fb35

The goal of this build is to maintain high worship energy, which leads to more power of your units. You pick mastery that decreases the rate of energy leaking and increases power of your units.

Focus on reserved core units. Don’t mindless sacrificed your gas units

You still  sacrificed basic units to summon Avatar when 500 energy though 

Use your Phantom Freely as calldown to deal with tough enemy waves.

Phantom recharge reduces your phantom production time from 4 mins to 3 mins. Which good active panel skill grants you grant far more phantom by sacrificing your basic units. So no need to reduce your passive phantom production.

**Ulrezaj worship**

https://preview.redd.it/2pitaraqwnzd1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=870546dc6adb010bbf0b4fdd1aa648d3fafcf920

The main goal of this build is focus on worship generators, reach 500, sacrificed to generate Phantoms, lead to 7 Phantom to summon Ulrezaj early,

In this build, most of your main force is zealot and Avatar. 

Warp in zealot, buff shield, charge in, 500 energy, sacrificed , profit

Your leftover gas turns into Immortal to clean up the rest, If your timing is right you may generate 7 phantom before the cool down of Panel Ulrezaj is up.

After summoning Ulrezaj, Focus on micro him teleports the map to farm energy and prolong his duration. Your R is pretty much killing anything so just teleport. R then V, then R against till the enemy is dead, repeatedly.

You will conserve to sacrifice your Phantom. If threatening early wave it’s ok to use but after that don’t. Your goal is assembly 7 Phantom so any phantom you sacrificed will prolong your Ulrezaj summoning

# Tip & trick

Ulrezaj summoning grants you 200 supplies so it is pretty common to get a supplied block when he is gone. Prepare for that and spam Pylon.

Beside Ulrezaj teleport, your army is immobile so prepare for an attack wave if your army is far.

Archon is a viable unit if the enemy  need to get MC. Put some Archon mix with Immortal for this"
I finally finished this game yesterday,chronotrigger,1gln5yx,2024-11-07 05:09:40,53,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1gln5yx/i_finally_finished_this_game_yesterday/,DeerVirax,,"I'm not sure if I should even make this post, since it probably won't bring much value or new insight to this subreddit, but none of my friends played Chrono Trigger and I just really feel like rambling about this gem to someone.

I played Chrono Trigger on Steam around 5 years ago, and while I rememeber liking it, I feel like I didn't appreciate it enough back then. I got around 95% of the way through the game, around The Fated Hour segment, but for some reason I stopped, probably distracted by high school. I tried to come back to finish it year later, but I got stuck on some challenging fight and had troubles getting used to the mechanics again, so I dropped it again. Bad mood related to Covid and the final year of high school probably also didn't help.

This game has been on the back of my mind for years, and I was considering starting a new playthrough, but I never did. Well, until recently. I found a used DS Lite in a used games store, and I decided to buy it since the only console I had was Switch, and I was curious how old handheld consoles were like. I was looking for games to test on it, and I wanted to try something familiar, so I decided to get Chrono Trigger's DS port, since I've heard it's good. I had to pause the playthrough, because some issues with the DS, it turned out that its motherboard was irreperable, so I refunded it and somehow found a used 3DS instead for a tolerable price, but that's beside the point.

In general, I forgot how fun to play this game is. The combat system is fun, fast and fluid, with no lengthy animations and gaps between turns. The enemy variety is great, and I appreciate that they often require specific strategies to take out, especially when it comes to bosses, beyond just spamming the hardest hitting techs. Speaking of techs, they are a really cool system, that does a great job at avoiding the ""spam the attack button"" strategy some RPGs have, and I like how they give each character more individuality in playstyle. Dual and triple techs are also a great idea that show teamwork among the party (except for Magus, because he's edgy), and give more reasons to bring a particular character in, beyond their own skillset. Also, I really love how none of the party members seems particularly weaker than the others. Of course, there are some stronger ones, like Ayla with her physical damage, but no one is useless and makes you feel like you're wasting a party slot. A lof of other RPGs have this issue, even these with party pool sizes similar to Chrono Trigger, like Xenoblade Chronicles (sorry, Sharla)

Exploration and general gameplay is also fun. There is just enough hidden nooks with secrets and side passages with loot to feel satisfying to explore, but not so many that you keep getting lost. The occasional puzzles in dungeons also usually were a nice distraction from combat, and never felt annoying. The overworlds are also just large enough that there is room to explore and NPCs to talk to, but there is virtually no useless locations. In general, I'm really impressed how well this game balances between being linear and more open-ended, avoiding pretty much most of the pitfalls of either approach.

The story was good. Just solid, fun, and interesting. It may not be one of my favourite stories ever in video games, but I was never bored by it, and I always wanted to keep on going to see what's next. I really appreciate how there is pretty much no filler and everything is either tied to the main story line of defeating Lavos or to individual characters. Part of me wanted this game to have some side quests, just to spend more time in this game and with these character, but overall I really appreciate the pacing of the game and the lack of filler. And the endgame when you get Epoch's ability to fly did scratch my itch for open-worldness, and some side plots, so I'm not going to complain.

The music is obviously great. Corridors of Time and Schala's Theme were a huge part of the reason why I've always had this game somewhere in my mind for the past few years. Still, this time I appreciated even more tracks in the OST. I feel like this soundtrack has almost no bad songs (though I was somewhat disappointed by Magus' Castle, but that's a me issue. His boss fight OST completely remedied that, though). I'm a fan of Yasunori Mitsuda's work in Xenoblade Chronicles series and it's really nice to see that even in his first venture in video game music (I think) he was already so consistently good.

What I think I didn't appreciate enough 5 years ago is the pixel art of this game. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was good, but I just didn't appreciate how pretty this game is. The tilesets are beautifully detailed and the animations of characters and monsters are really expressive. There are some genuinely stunning places in this game.

I'm sorry for a long post, but I just really wanted to ramble about Chrono Trigger a bit. I probably didn't say anything new or particularly analitical about this game, but I know there are some people who like when others praise something they love (I'd know, I'm one of them), so I suppose it's a post for these people. I'm 22 and I didn't grow up with this game, but I love it nonetheless. Maybe I'll try Chrono Cross at some point, since I've heard that the true ending allows you to >!save Schala,!< but I've heard some mixed opinions about this game, and I watched a review/story summary showing how convoluted last 1/3rd of that game is, so I'll probably put it off for later.

Thank you for reading my overly long post, and I hope you'll have a good day.

(Also, since I already wrote so much, what's the opinion of people here about Sea of Stars? It looks gorgeous, has music composed by Mitsuda, is seemingly inspired by Chrono Trigger, and has good reviews, but I've also seen some contradictory opinions on the internet, and people on r/jrpg seem to think it's the worst attrocity in humanity's history, so I thought I'd ask here)"
God Of Time Appears To Me,Dreams,1gjy59o,2024-11-04 23:03:25,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1gjy59o/god_of_time_appears_to_me/,Shadrast,,"I was absolutely floored by this dream I had today.

The following dream description is basically what I wrote as soon as I woke up.

For context about the dream I’m LDS. If you’ve ever been to an LDS Church you’ll kind of understand how the inside typically looks.

The dream starts with me doing some holiday activity at the Sagecrest Church. Kind of like some Easter Egg hunt, only instead of Eggs, we’re taking OPD carts like at Walmart and searching for missing OPD printers, and the messages printed on one single page.

Then we have to take those messages and search for the answers to them.

I find one on a shelf that has the message “You” with an arrow pointing to me.

Puzzled. I go to my stake President, the one in charge of this activity, for help.

The stake President who’s sitting on a chair on the other side of the church in a hallway, and is wearing Sunglasses, directs me towards a puzzle on the wall right behind him, and says if I need anything he’ll be in the Gym.

The puzzle is simple enough. I just have to fill in the blanks of phrases and spiritual quotes on one side of a wall, to the other. Not much of a puzzle honestly.

However there’s so many quotes that in my dream I become ridiculously confused and frustrated.

Two hours later I’m maybe halfway done, and people start dispensing from the Sacrament Hall from whatever Christmas activity going on in there.

People start asking me if I need help.

One lady even sort of imposes her help. I get sort of annoyed and frustrated and leave.

I make my way through the second gym, because for some reason this Church has two, where a Christmas dinner is going one, and then exit into the hallway where I found the clue.

I turn left and head to the left and open the door at the corner where I find a…second chapel. Where a sacrament meeting is being held by Bishop Hayden Christensen.

I close that door, and head left down the backend, and come across a corner foyer with a Christmas Tree in it where a group of people are praying, with Steven He giving the prayer.

I turn left, down the side where I was doing the puzzle, only I turn right this time to go outside.

I walk left towards the end of the parking spaces, the midday turning into night, and I look up at the starry sky, where the moon and two other planets so close you can see the lights of what appears to be cities emanating from them.

I start praying out loud to Heavenly Father. Crying out frustratingly, “Why hast thou forsaken me?!” 

I don’t remember the rest of the prayer, aside from I was very snooty.

Anyways, I turn to go towards the left end of the parking lot where my car is, when what appears to be a Santa Statue on a Christmas decoration trailer , at least an old man with long white hair and a beard and robed in blue, comes alive and with a creepy smile says “come and sit”, while patting on the spot of bale of hay to his right.

And I shrug and do as the old man instructs.

And I ask, “Who are you.”

There are certain parts of this next conversation that are blurry.

For example, I think he was sent by God, by I don’t remember his exact words.

I do remember this conversation.

“All your life, you fall for every cute blonde you come across”

I don’t remember the point of that.

Eventually we get to the point where the old man drops off the trailer, walks to curb, opens a large rectangular sewer entrance and beckons me to come.

So I come and he beckons me that enter the sewer.

So I do, I go down slanted cement and come across a an analogue clock face up in sewer water.

The man follows and I ask the man, “Just who are you”

The man admits, “I’m the God of time. Back in the day, we were just as important as the Angels.”

He then adds “You’ll need to collect all the Dragon Diamond Time Stones to neutralize the upcoming threat.”

And me who was looking at the clock was like, “What?”

And turns to the man who has scurried to the top and has shut the entrance. 

He yells. “Psych!” And laughs manically as he runs away.

For some reason I fall on my back and try to cry out for help, but my voice is gone and no one can hear me.

I then “wake up” in a hospital bed.

Apparently I had passed out in the sewer. But was found and rescued.

What happened was the old man, who wasn’t really an old man, just a lady with mental issues, offered me some drugs, and I took them.

And she had manipulated me into the sewer.

Afterwards I start montage working out with my best friend to gain muscle and lose weight.

Months later a major bank is attacked in a major city Aliens with highly advanced tech.

And the dream ends.

I did research after this to learn about Gods of Time, and learned of Chronos. 

But like. It’s one of those dreams where it’s like “What the Hell?”

Because I certainly wasn’t doing anything remotely close to thinking of Gods of Time before I want to sleep. I was praying, but that’s about all that I was going on."

"[WTS] WE-Tech M4 SBR, some problems but not boneyard",airsoftmarket,1gho2nb,2024-11-01 23:51:43,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/airsoftmarket/comments/1gho2nb/wts_wetech_m4_sbr_some_problems_but_not_boneyard/,nsx2brz,,"https://imgur.com/a/Hk7iGLI

Little bit of backstory: Bought this M4CQB a little while ago, kitted it out, and it broke on the second shot while on the chrono. $200 later (RA-Tech steel bolt, npas, angel custom nozzle), it broke on the field. It was the sear this time. One RA-Tech steel fcg later, it worked, until now. It had been a wall-hanger for a bit, due to my Vfc m110, and I decided that I wanted to do some backyard plinking with it. It broke on the first shot (Bolt got pushed up above the cocked hammer, no it was not the little grub screw next to the buffer tube's fault). One complete dissasembly and short-stroking later, it was solved. That's where I am today, wanting to get rid of this cursed machine. 

Known Issues: 
- Rear takedown pin detent + spring somewhere in my rug
- Gas siphoning and extreme pressure loss (not cooldown, though) on semi-auto spam
- Repro eotech sorta holds zero? The reticle moves around while firing, but always returns to roughly zero afterwards...
- Forwards charging handle a bit sticky/grindy (lube won't stick around for long)

""Features"": 
- Forwards charging handle
- Off-brand but real steel magnifier has horrid eye relief
- QD Suppressor
- Semi-auto fire selector installed currently, auto-sear removed (can be reinstalled, original fire selector also)
- Bolt catch barely works

This gun was very expensive... around, say, $1800 new? Let's put the price at $650 OBO, shipped USA only. Full steel internals, lightly used. I hate that thing. I will say to NOT buy this gun unless you're a tinkerer, or more familiar with WE-Tech than I am. 

Externals: 
- Maple Leaf 9"" M-LOK Handguard with forwards charging handle (can switch sides)
- Generic 5.56-style QD Suppressor + flash hider
- Repro EO-Tech Sight with iffy zeroing
- Real Steel 3x Magnifier (albeit from crappy brand)
- Hera Arms CQR Furniture (I can switch out the foregrip with an SE-5)
- Anodized Red Accents
- Ambi controls
- 5x STANAG Metal Magazines (None leaky, one has a stuck spring)

Internals: 
- RA-Tech Steel FCG, Bolt
- RA-Tech Recoil Buffer
- RA-Tech NPAS Unit
- Angel Custom Red Plastic Nozzle"
Custom Review Issue 14 - Tracer,marvelchampionslcg,1gga81a,2024-10-31 05:11:26,17,0.88,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelchampionslcg/comments/1gga81a/custom_review_issue_14_tracer/,SSNC_Luck,,"WELCOME! This has been a very fun test, Tracer has been a blast to play and the content she provides, and the other things her creator (JustATuna) has created is super satisfying. I am very excited to share her with you and hope that you feel intrigued to give her a run! You can find Tuna's other work here

[Lena Oxton Alter Ego](https://preview.redd.it/pi7e4u12u1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdefe8ed44c92cd4fc912f1a2371cee2e2562b15)

Tracer is a very unique character, and from the get go you can see the strange things beginning to happen. She has a 5 hand size in AE and a pretty unique Setup mechanic. Her setup lets her usually start the game in a healthy state as she gets to see a good chunk of her cards before the game starts, meaning she usually starts in an ok state. I really like this set up and it feels great, very nice QOL for a character that you will see has many barriers to learning how to play her efficiently.

[Tracer - Hero](https://preview.redd.it/yivmq574u1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8b695d9e9969a74e347dc3b8c4567383fe9e6a5)

Ok, so here we go, a 3 hand size hero, something you won't see too often. So while Tracer has a 3 hand size her ability kind of makes it feel much bigger then that. Her balanced statline is very helpful as she can be a bit squishy if not piloted optimally. A lot of learning Tracer is learning how to navigate your hands with your blink ability. As we get into her cards you'll see she wants empty or almost empty hands, to get the most effect from her cards. Thus there is a native difficulty of learning how to deckbuild/pilot Tracer but when you get it down she feels great.

\---

[Winston - B](https://preview.redd.it/4ts7vrb6u1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5e562f3820393b08fa8937be890c6878bf006b4)

Winston is pretty good, he covers a lot of what Tracer wants/needs to get done. Getting Winston early is great as he can tank for you/ fetch your very needed tech cards. He has the same problem of Shuri though that if he doesn't hit early he loses A LOT of benefit. A 5 HP tank for 3 cost is nice, but being 3 cost and her small hands he can create some awkward situations where you have to flip to play him. Perfect world he is in your opening hand, fetches you a tech, you play it and go fast.



\---

[Just In Time - B](https://preview.redd.it/1c593rz7u1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66e0ebedc2c51ccd7bd94f564d6f2628f22f705)

This isssssssssss a solid card. Not amazing, not bad, solid. I never really want to use Tracers basics beyond the Goggles activation, so it's not as useful as you would think. It can of course come in clutch, but of her events this one is the more niche one. Still the flavor baby!



\---

[Recall - B](https://preview.redd.it/g0cpfiadu1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=345d03b463c60f71926834b2b496d7149511c2d3)

This is a very cool card. It's suuuper thematic, and can actually get you killed if you're unlucky. Since you're taking the dmg before healing you can die if you get hit to zero which is fun. Overall it's a fun and thematic defense event, there's a ton of theme throughout this set.



\---

[Fast Forward - A](https://preview.redd.it/d8uwrybqu1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcecc5e48c09ad0aa00b8ec1a1e4812e0fb8ea31)

This is a fun card, giving Tracer another use of her blink in card form is fun and useful. Since Tracer can get bricked hands easily, this card helps ease that pain. Being a zero cost on top of a whiteout basically, makes this a very useful card. Her cards are pretty straightforward which is funny to me because her gameplay can be pretty complicated.



\---

[Blast and Dash - A](https://preview.redd.it/ooxoerfjx1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=202274cea3a84afdc7a68486df1d1a7264639c1f)

Tracer's end game card, this is where her damage comes from. She can rewind this and this is how she gets big burst to get through the scenario or clear the board. Beyond that, it's just satisfying to play and use. Less useful before recall, but still a solid play and almost always feels good to use.



\---

[Emily's Apartment - C](https://preview.redd.it/oof9dowkx1yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e785c32c4c2003abd63bf05454e88bb44c359fef)

So this is a polarizing card for me, I'm not a big fan of recovery effects, like it for sure can help but it's fairly niche imo. The resource, IS USEFUL, but it's AE tied and usually when I NEED it, I'm hero side. It's cheap and not a bad card, but to me, it feels very niche, I'm usually pitching this card.



\---

[Rewind - A](https://preview.redd.it/e9zf81mc02yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef87c6027b318267e3f12384dd0e4164dcf8e27)

Fun card, needed for her late game dmg cycling. This card has a lot of fun uses as she can use a lot of her events in many situations, she can also grab events that aren't just identity, it's a very fun card. Theme is king in this set and this hits.



\---

[Tracer's Goggles - A](https://preview.redd.it/tlyqk1ve02yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c659c28ca797e054375191cb246c588ce4cbf38)

Solid card, this lets her be useful with her basics. Really cool because it can increase her defense as well which helps her not feel as squishy. The card is super flexible and feels really satisfying to use. 



\---

[Pulse Pistol - A](https://preview.redd.it/x20ewc5g02yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a1bf75b5cae0cac489dae04068b70e23d08bba)

This is Tracer right here, get your pistols out and go to town. She has two pistols in her deck so getting both out in the first pass is ideal. These are so fun and satisfying, and they are the backbone of her gameplay. The theme and feeling of Tracer is right here, and if this don't do it for you, then Tracer ain't gonna do it for ya.



\---

[Chrono Accelerator - A](https://preview.redd.it/ecsee31l02yd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=9359f04cb7f9d591fec1c6c33f82a1b39228a407)

This card rocks. It's so fun to use, I love the puzzles it creates on your turns. I love using this to play a helicarrier, I love using this to fullycharge a Machine Man. I LOVE THIS CARD. It's strong and fun, thematic and cool. MVP and I fuck with that.



\---



Aspects - Tracer has a large deckbuilding barrier. If you don't take into account the amount of bricking that can occur you will struggle hard. She has a learning curve and while I think she can find some success in green, MAYBE blue, she shines in Red and yellow. She isn't color locked though so she gets points for that.

[A Tier - Blinking into the bottom of A tier](https://preview.redd.it/4506cspu22yd1.jpg?width=1543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b67c324959eddf65094b558a775b791daf55c8ff)

Tier - Tracer is very unique, and bursting with flavor. She is strong in some cases, but average in others. Her high end built out states are good, not op in any case but she will normally carry her own weight if you deck built correctly. I think Bottom of A tier is a fair placement for her, late game Tracer could probably be looking at High A, but she feels remarkably balanced and fair.

Print it baby. She's theme on theme, fun, and the art is great. I have enjoyed all my time with her and yall will too, if you have any experience with Overwatch you'll feel right at home.



Some people may balk at characters from franchises very removed from comics being added but when they are this well done, I find it hard to argue with. I also like anything that feels well done, and Tuna's work is put through the works in testing (I played a bunch of Tracer myself for some of the testing). Until next time heroes, ON YOUR LEFT!

Very reasonable and serious Protoss buff ideas,starcraft2,1gdnmxo,2024-10-27 18:56:04,4,0.57,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft2/comments/1gdnmxo/very_reasonable_and_serious_protoss_buff_ideas/,ToiletOfPaper,,"As Protoss has been getting nerf after nerf after nerf for the past few years, it's time for some completely proportional and sane Protoss buffs so that Terrans can feel our pain for once. **The actual changes are bolded for TL;DR purposes.**

- Fun fact: much like creep, tech labs and reactors have no loyalties. You can kill someone's barracks, float your own into place, and take ownership of their reactor/tech lab. As such, **Protoss can now use Recall to pull reactors and tech labs from Terran bases and then adapt them for usage with their own production structures.** A tech lab would give Protoss the ability to warp in Terran units.

- The feedback ability has gotten a lot of feedback over the years. It's been nerfed repeatedly, both directly in the form of reduced damage and indirectly in the form of other units switching to cooldowns. It's time it gives a little feedback of its own. **Feedback now permanently reduces attack speed, movement speed, and HP of all units of the same type as the target by 10%. This effect can stack infinitely.**

- What do shields do? They protect. Shields are not supposed to make you more vulnerable to damage unless they're flawed. Protoss shields are the most advanced technology in the Koprulu sector and therefore should have no flaws. **All Protoss units' armor values are now added to their shields.** For example, a unit with 4 armor and 3 shield armor would now have 4 armor and 7 shield armor. In addition, **all units with shields are now immune to the effects of EMP.**

The ability to manipulate time is among the most incredible skills that the Protoss wield. However, they criminally under-use it by only speeding up their own buildings and briefly slowing down their enemies in a small area. **Chrono Boost can now target allied units to give them a 50% bonus to attack, movement, shield regen, and energy regen speed. In addition, Chrono Boost can now be stacked multiplicatively.**

- As it turns out, air-to-air Tempest attacks are not limited by the projectile losing coherence or running out of momentum. Instead, their only real limitation is that after a certain distance, the Tempest can't hit small targets accurately enough. Flying buildings are not small targets, so **Tempests can now hit flying buildings from up to 40 range (up from 14).**"

Howdy yall,
Not looking for trades rn, college and rent aren't cheap lol. Shoot me cash offers on whatever, if it's reasonable I might take it. Also can do local pickup in Lex.


What's for sale:
(Buyer pays shipping)

1. Chrono Blaster - SOLD

2. Knockoff Vortex Razor - SOLD

3. KWA MP7 w/ 2 mags - SOLD

4. Elite Force Semi Auto CO2 Shotgun - $140

Never fielded, almost brand new, just been tested and shot around, never used in a game. Semi auto takes CO2 in the stock. Comes with 7 shells, shoots 3 bbs at a time.

5. WE Tech Galaxy - SOLD

6. AAP-01 With Carbon Fiber Upper - $70

Project gun, got it new from a contest I won, then printed the upper, but it broke quickly. Never fielded. Doesn't work right. You'll want to get an aftermarket/replacement hammer system, and the barrel sticks up a bit, but if you're gonna replace the hopup/barrel anyway for a build, your getting a good deal, because your probably gonna replace those parts for a build anyway, and your getting a really nice upper with it, carbon fiber nylon uppers are not cheap. Comes with original mag.

7. EMG/CYMA SGR-12 - $270

Never fielded, so it's in excellent almost near new shape. Comes with the gun and 1 mag.

I'm dissatisfied with the latest patch. Game feels stale. Protoss feels weak. Here's my dream patch notes (4600 MMR Zerg)  (just for fun post),starcraft,1gc5lan,2024-10-25 17:44:12,10,0.6,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1gc5lan/im_dissatisfied_with_the_latest_patch_game_feels/,Aggressive_Bird3214,Fluff,"The goal of these fake **for fun** patch notes is to shake up the meta game so I no longer watch pro tournaments (and play ladder games) that feel stale and boring. In ZvT, it feels like it's almost always 3 CC 1 gas vs 7:00 Hive rush to late game. Protoss feels like it rolls over and dies every game despite their best efforts. This fake for fun patch shakes up the meta game, while adding fun new dynamics.

*Fake New Patch Notes: (For fun)*

# Zerg:

**Queen**: Cost reduced to 75 Minerals (From 150)  
**Transfuse:** Upgradeable at Lair or Unlocked at Hive.  
**Max Queen Energy:** Reduced to 75 (from 200)  
**Queen HP** reduced to 100 (from 175)  
**Queen Armor** reduced to 1 (from 1 (+1))  
**Queen anti-air range** reduced to 6 (from 7)  
**Queen ground and air attacks** dmg reduced by 1  
**Queen build time:** reduced to 25 sec (from 36)

**Baneling Nest:** Cost decreased to 75 M 25 G (from 100 M, 50 G)  
**Baneling Nest:** Build time decreased to 37 s (from 43)

**Roach Warren:** Cost decreased to 125 M (from 150 M)  
**Roach Warren:** Build time decreased to 34 s (from 39)

**New unit: Devourer.** (Like brood war)  
The Devourer is an anti-air flying unit unlocked with the greater spire and is morphed from Mutalisks.

**Fake patch comments:** The queen is a common pain point for Terran and Protoss players who think it does too much defensively. Additionally, as a Zerg player, it feels boring to have to make them every game defensively to survive. This change takes away the queens role as a primary defensive unit and enhances it's role as a macro mechanic. These changes give Zergs more minerals and time to transition quickly into actual defensive units, such as banelings or roaches to stave off early aggression, while maintaining the queens possible role as a spell caster in the lategame with transfuse still being on the table. Additionally, the main power point of the queen is that it doesn't cost Larva. The decreased Queen build time and drastically reduced cost should allow Zerg players to more quickly inject hatcheries and expand to make up for additional larva needed, which would in turn spice up the early game.

Additionally, Zerg anti-air in the late game feels relatively boring as you have to use corruptor viper. Giving Zerg an additional unit with a niche anti-air use case would feel fun and new for Zerg compositions against mass air armies.

# Protoss:

**Disruptor:** completely removed.  
**New Robo Bay unit: Reaver.**

**Stalker:** attack speed increased by 33% to .89 (from 1.34)  
**Stalker:** attack dmg decreased to 9 (+1). (From 13 (+1))  
**Stalker:** HP increased to 90 (from 80)  
(These units feel like they're made of paper mache, and are mostly unthreatening. +3 melee zerglings are scary. +3 infantry marines are very scary. +3 stalkers are scary but nowhere near as scary as the other two. This change aims to give the stalkers increased ability to stand their ground in head to head fights, and also increase their DPS and effectiveness via upgrades and by allowing them to snipe off enemy units faster.)

**Zealot:** New Lategame upgrade from Templar Archives which brings back the ""extra dmg on contact"" for the charge ability. Give it a cool jumping animation on top of the charge like the zealot from the LotV campaign cinematic.

**Sentry:** Attack range increased to 7 (from 5)  
**Sentry:** Guardian shield radius increased to 5 (from 4.5)

**Colossus**: New Lategame upgrade from Robotics Bay: **Frak Shields.**  
**Frak shields:** The colossus gains a bonus shield bar on top of regular shields / HP that only works against air attacks.  
**Colossus:** Cost reduced to 275 M 175 G

**Battery overcharge:** Nerf healing by 50%

Keep new energy overcharge ability from PTR.

Keep Tempest changes from PTR.

**Returning unit: Mothership Core.** The mothership core cannot auto attack, and can only cast a weaker version of Time Warp (smaller radius). Buildable from Nexus after Cybercore tech.

**Chrono boosts now stack.**

**Fake patch comments:** I feel like the vast majority of the time I see a standard Terran army with libs, ghosts, marine medivac marauder, versus a standard stalker colossus pheonix composistion, the Protoss gets steam rolled. The stalker changes along with the colossus changes should help keep the Protoss more competetive in these situations.  The colossus upgrade will also help them stay alive versus Vikings, while not really impacting the ZvP matchup. Also, the Sentry buffs make guardian shield more effective as Sentrys will now outrange stalkers, making it easier to keep them alive while casting the spell. Additionally, the disruptor I feel is poorly designed. Not fun to watch, not fun to play against. Even if I see MaxPax, Her0, or someone hit a massive shot in a game I just wince and feel bad for both players that this unit exists. After watching some of the Sc2 vs Brood War games I realized how much fun the reaver was to watch, so I substituted the disruptor out for it. Lastly, with the aid of Energy Overcharge, the addition of a one spell Mothership core could give Protoss some fun new defensive capabilities in the early game without bringing back the pain points that got it removed in the first place.

# Terran:

**Cyclone:** Revert back to tech lab cyclone.  
  
**Ghost:** auto attack dmg decreased to 4 (+1) from (10 (+1))

**Neosteel Plating:** Armor gained for buildings reduced from (2) to (1)

**Thor:** new lategame agility upgradeable fusion core: Barrage - Thor bombards a target area for 5 seconds (like the Odin ability)

Keep sensor tower range nerf from current PTR

Keep Planetary Fortress armor nerf from current PTR.

Keep liberator changes from current PTR.

**Fake patch comments:** As a Zerg player, I don't feel confident in giving a lot of Terran changes. I'll just echo what I've heard pro players mention and nerf the campy planetary ghost playstyle while giving the Thor a cool new ability. Terran's maintain the power of the ghost spell casting but are disencentivized to build 20 of them since they are no longer good in a straight up fight.

Overall, this fake for fun patch buffs Protoss, refactors zerg early game, and nerfs Terran lategame camp styles while introducing some fun new abilities and units. Hope y'all enjoyed this pipe dream of a fake patch notes.

Edit: added Bold / Italics for legibility

Which version of a character do you get when you use the Chrono Cross? ,ChronoCross,1gbptl8,2024-10-25 04:58:28,19,0.85,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1gbptl8/which_version_of_a_character_do_you_get_when_you/,nyesticles123,,"So I've been replaying the game on Switch, and trying to get all characters using the Continue+ method (see below). I just realized, which version of a character do I get when I finally use the Chrono Cross in terms of Elements allocated, items equipped, and stats increased? Like if I have a Sneff in one playthrough with low stats and only an Uplift element equipped, and a Sneff in a later playthrough with better stats and elements, which one do I get if I use the Chrono Cross? 


Method used to get all characters:
Normally you can only get everyone on your 3rd play (for 3rd Viper Manor guide). But with Continue+ feature, it's possible to get all 44 characters only in one full playthrough.

So here's the steps:
-start a fresh new game, play until you need to choose a guide (Nikki/Guile/Pierre) for Viper Manor. 

Save on different slot. Call this Save A. 
-continue until Kid is poisoned. 

Save on different slot again. Call this Save B. 

-continue until Harle joins party but before she leaves. Call this Save C. 

-continue until you reach end game (near final battle). Call this Save D. 

-finish the game (doesn't matter which ending) then save a Clear Data. 

-feel free to always overwrite Clear Data for next steps. 

-load that Clear Data then choose Continue+
-Continue+ Save A then pick different guide (2nd guide)
-beat final boss to make Clear Data

-repeat the process for 3rd guide

-Continue+ Save B and choose different option about what you're gonna do with poisoned Kid
-play along until you get Razzly/Korcha/Mel or Glenn/Macha/Doc then beat final boss to make Clear data

-Continue+ Save C and beat final boss again to ""record"" Harle

-Continue+ Save D. Assuming you have CHRONO CROSS key item, go to Sprigg's house via Hydra Marshes (HW) the same way you came as Lynx. Use that item there. 

-VOILA. You now have all 44 characters, including Harle. 

And that's it for the trick. You can only Continue+ onto 1st play (non-New Game+) save data.
So after you're done with this trick, you'll always get everyone on subsequent playthroughs as soon as you use CHRONO CROSS item inside Sprigg's house. Though Kid still not back until you go into her dream.
If you want Harle as permanent character later, you need to beat Time Devourer BEFORE SHE LEAVES. That's what Save C for.


I highly recommend choose Razzly over Glenn for first playthrough. That's it if you want to get every Lv7 Tech.
I took Razzly route to get RazFlower later since it's MISSABLE if you take Glenn route on current playthrough
Sure you can import ""recorded"" characters via CHRONO CROSS but not their Lv7 tech if they don't have it initially and must be ""found"".
I can still import Glenn and get Dual Einlanzer in Razzly playthrough
But I CANNOT get RazFlower even if I import Razzly in Glenn playthrough
Since getting RazFlower needs specific steps which is impossible in Glenn playthrough.


Save B isn't really necessary if you don't mind going through Viper Manor section again for second time with your 2nd guide.
Since timeframe between Save A and Save B is quite very short. Just pre and post Viper Manor.

Oh, and each time you Continue+ and want to beat final boss to make Clear Data, you can make detour to Bend of Time (only if you have boat access) to beat trio Magus' goon from CT. Then play along with ""Spekkio"". It'll reward you Dreamer's Sarong. Anyone with it will always start battle with Lv8 Element.

Howdy yall,
Not looking for trades rn, college and rent aren't cheap lol. Shoot me cash offers on whatever, if it's reasonable I might take it. Also can do local pickup in Lex.

First up, I'll start with what I'm looking to buy:

Looking for a complete ssg10 bolt assembly (bolt handle not needed) to replace the gas assembly in a vsr10 platformed sniper. Or a wolverine bolt m hpa engine for a vsr10. Send me a shipped price to 40508, and be reasonable, I'm not paying near new for a used engine.

What's for sale:
(Buyer pays shipping)

1. Chrono Blaster - SOLD


2. Knockoff Vortex Razor HD 1-6 LPVO $155

Recouping some losses on this one. Long story short, I got scammed buying this on hopup, it was supposed to be a repro scope, however the mount it originally came with when I bought it was supposed to be a real Giessle mount, it was clearly a fake and it broke, the seller doubled down on it, was kinda rude, but I had just started college and didn't have the time to deal with paypal. Also hopup won't let me list it even though it's clearly marked as not authentic. It is however, a really nice fake, good external build quality, the 1x zoom is more like 1.5 or 2x, its pretty clear at low zoom but does get blurrier the further you up the magnification, the dot is slightly off center and pretty dim. However it's a very nice scope for airsoft use, and it has a killflash.

3. KWA MP7 w/ 2 mags - SOLD

4. Elite Force Semi Auto CO2 Shotgun - $140

Never fielded, almost brand new, just been tested and shot around, never used in a game. Semi auto takes CO2 in the stock. Comes with 7 shells, shoots 3 bbs at a time.

5. WE Tech Galaxy - SOLD

6. AAP-01 With Carbon Fiber Upper - $75

If I was the balance council,starcraft,1g9ppp2,2024-10-22 14:46:20,1,0.56,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1g9ppp2/if_i_was_the_balance_council/,HyperDiaper666,Fluff,"**Ghost** \- increased Steady Targeting energy cost to 100. Personal Cloaking upgrade removed. Cloak now unlocked from the start. Tac Nuke Strike AOE increased by 50%. Tac Nuke Strike cast range increased by 50%. Removed damage indicator to allies and the player owning the unit. Tac Nuke Strike now does 500 damage instead of 300 (+200 to buildings).

*We feel like Ghost's ability to counter most units belonging to the Zerg faction is unfair. And overshadows more complex options like Marauders, Thors and Vikings. However at the same time ""snipe"" might be the only ability keeping the Ghost alive in the current high level meta of Starcraft. So, we have drastically improved their ability to harass enemies across long ranges via the Tac Nuke Strike. We have removed the damage indicator to add confusion to the unit as a drawback to this now very powerful ability.*

**Viking** \- changed damage from 12 (+8 to mechanical) to 20.  
**Hellbat** \- health increased from 135 to 150. Base armour increased from 0 to 1. Removed Biological attribute.  
Smart Servos removed from the game.

*We feel like Smart Servos is an upgrade with no real purpose it can perform within the game. So, we have removed it. Hopefully permanently. To make up for this severe change. We have increased the tankiness of Hellbats. And gave Vikings enough damage to twoshot Drones.*

**Zealot** \- now begins the game with post-Charge upgrade movement speed. Charge now adds 30 shields. And increases shields base armour by 1.  
**Adepts** \- now have the same speed as their Shade. Shade can be recast at any time to teleport to its location.  
**High Templar** \- base attack damage changed from 4 to 5 (+100 against Psionic). Can now target air units.  
**Archon** \- no longer Psionic. Is immune to EMP.  
**Dark Templar** \- shields increased to 100. Base shield armour is now 1. Removed Archon Merge. Added Dark Archon Merge. Dark Archon uses Spectre's abilities. Has a long range low damage attack that restores energy.  
**Sentry** \- changed base damage from 4 (+4 against Shields) to 8.

*We don't like the position the Protoss infantry is in now. And have decided to thoroughly increases its capabilities to allow it to compete in the late game against Terrans. Especially in response to the Hellbat change.*

**Colossus** \- starts with Extended Thermal Lance.  
**Void Ray** \- Prismatic Alignment replaced with Prismatic Beams. Prismatic Beams increase damage the longer the attack animation occurs, but only against armoured units. Base armour increased from 0 to 2.  
**Tempest** \- Tectonic Destabilizers upgrade removed. Added String Disturber passive ability. Damaging an enemy with a base attack deals double damage. This effect can be triggered only once per minute against the same enemy by no more than one Tempest. Additionally, base attacks temporarily reduce armour of damaged target.  
**Carrier** \- Increased mineral cost to 400 from 350. Vespene cost to 300 from 250. Health increased from 300 to 400. Shields increased from 150 to 250.

*We imagine too few late game units feel viable for Protoss. And we wish to change that. We will carefully observe these changes. As we expect them to be quite impactful.*

**Phoenix/Oracle** \- Anion Pulse-Crystals upgrade removed. Replaced with Paradoxical Charging. Paradoxical Charging costs 200 minerals and 200 vespene. Paradoxical Charging increases starting energy of Phoenixes and Oracles from 50 to 200.

*We feel like currently Phoenix is too effective at killing Mutalisks. And in order to bring that unit back into the game, we are reworking Phoenix's upgrade meant to counter it in the late game. We also wish this new upgrade will encourage aggressive harassment playstyles even after enemy bases have been immunized against such.*

**Mutalisks** \- base damage changed from 9 to 9 (+9 against Buildings). Bounces no longer deal 0.33 damage of the original projectile. They instead now deal the original damage. Tissue Regeneration ability removed.

*Mutalisk being the face of Starcraft deserves to be a highly dangerous unit that will be seen in most if not all games against Zerg. We feel like there are currently enough counters in the game to prevent it from becoming too overwhelming.*

**Immortal** \- Barrier has to be researched at Robotics Facility. Cost reduced to 250.  
**Siege Tanks** \- Siege Mode has to be researched at a Tech Lab attached to a Factory.

*We wanted to reduce the rate at which a match ascends towards the mid and late game by reducing the effectiveness of these units immediately after they are produced.*

**Orbital Command** \- Scanner Sweep energy cost increased from 50 to 100. Calldown: Extra Supplies now increases Supply Depot's health to 500. Increasing its current health by % of health gained. Meaning applying it to an undamaged Supply Depot will have the most effect.  
**Sensor Tower** \- cost increased to 250 minerals and 200 vespene. From 125 and 50.  
**Bunker** \- Neosteel Armor removed. Returned Neosteel Frame. Neosteel Frame additionally increases Bunkers, Missile Turret and Planetary Fortresses armour by 2.

*Suck my \[CENSORED\].*

**Baneling** \- now starts with additional 5 health.  
**Hydralisk** \- Hydralisk Den no longer requires Lair.  
**Queen** \- mineral cost increased from 150 to 200.  
**Spore Crawler** \- no longer roots at 50% faster rate than the Spine Crawler.

*We wanted to encourage aggressive playstyles for Zerg by nerfing Queens and increasing the strength of their general offensive units in the early game.*

**Banshee** \- starts with cloak. Armour increased from 0 to 1.  
**Raven** \- no longer requires a tech lab. Base armour reduced from 1 to 0. Removed Interference Matrix. Auto-turret DPS halved. Duration extended to permanent. Only one Auto-Turret may be operational at a time per Raven. Gave back Point Defense Drone. Point Defense Drone can only negate upwards of two projectiles a second. Is no longer restricted by energy. Lasts until destroyed. Health increased from 50 to 100. Only one may be operational at a time per Raven. Defense Drones will often overkill a singular projectile preventing them from being effectively spammed. Anti-Armor Missile reverted to Seeker Missile. Seeker Missile energy cost increased to 100.

*We feel like by removing the old idea behind the Raven's identity we have unnecessarily punished plenty of players who have enjoyed it. We also wanted to give Raven the ability to scout for threats more easily. As well as increased Banshee's ability to harass and scout as well. This is to make up for Terran's loss of vision tools due to the Scanner Sweep nerf.*

**Swarm Host** *-* Locust health increased from 50 to 100. Base armour increased from 0 to 1. Can no longer fly. Swarm Host now needs to be burrowed in order for the spawn to occur. Cost changed from 100 minerals and 75 vespene to 200 minerals and 100 vespene. Duration of Locusts changed from 18 seconds to 60.

*The idea behind the Swarm Host being a harassment unit was and always will be idiotic. So, instead we have reverted its identity to the original one. Being a siege unit.*

**Brood Lord** \- reverted movement speed increase. Reverted Broodling nerfs.  
**Corruptor/Zergling** \- Morph to Brood Lord duration decreased from 24 seconds to 14. Morph to Baneling duration decreased from 14 to 4.  
**Ultralisk** \- Add Morph to Omegalisk ability. Lasts 58 seconds. Costs 300 minerals and 200 gas. Increases size. Increases damage and health stats. (edit: the Cocoon   
**Viper/Infestor** \- Base Viper armour increased from 1 to 2. Base Infestor armour increased from 0 to 2. Neural Parasite can now only affect biological units. The duration is permanent. Infestor no longer needs to remain stationary to keep the unit under control. Killing the Infestor will no longer annul the ability. Microbial Shroud replaced with Infestation. Infestation can be used on enemy terran buildings to transform them into infested structures. If the infested Terran building was capable of producing units, Infested Terrans and Infested Marines can be trained at it at a rapid pace to quickly overwhelm Terran bases.

*We wanted to shift Zerg late game a bit. And felt like bullying Serral wasn't the necessary path to take.*

**Thor** \- Removed High Impact Payload. Added back 250mm Strike Cannons. The ability no longer stuns the target. The ability doesn't have to be researched at the Tech Lab.

*Thor being a large Goliath is the opposite of what we wanted it to be during the initial development. So, we have decided to fire the guy who gave that idea. Just kidding, we fired them a long time ago. On accident actually.*

**Battlecruiser** *-* Removed Tactical Jump ability. Yamato Cannon is now unlocked from the start. Attack range increased. Damage increased against Light enemies by 100%.

*Battlecruiser being a large-sized Stalker with cheese potential wasn't necessarily what we wanted it to be. We prefer it having the identity of a powerful late game tool designed to counter Carriers, Marines, etc. We will experiment with these changes in case we achieve the opposite of the effect we wish it to have. Although it's not recommended for us to punish player creativity in spite of that being the tradition of typical balance changes.*

**Corruptor** \- base armour increased from 2 to 3. Caustic Spray ability removed. Brought back Corruption as a passive ability. Each attack causes the unit to take 5 damage (+5 against Massive), stacks up to 10 times, over time for the duration of 2 seconds.

*In response to incoming changes we have pre-buffed the Corruptor and gave it the ability to deal damage over time, so that it becomes less obnoxious in case the damaged unit is not instantly killed. This will also increase Corruptor's micro potential.*

**Nexus** \- Chrono Boost no longer increase the rate at which structure operates. Instead it increases the rate at which the structure builds. Only one charge per Nexus. Strategic Recall renamed to Rapid Warp. Duration changed from 4 to 1 second. Now fully heals recalled units. Energy cost increased to 100. Battery Overcharge removed. Added new ability Psi Connection. Psi Connection has minimum range of 10. Meaning it cannot be used on nearby units. Spend 50 energy to restore 50 shields. Has global range.

*We wanted to make the Nexus a more interesting unit to play with. Simple as that. However we wanted to also encourage cannon rushes. HOWEVER, we also wanted it to come at the cost of losing the ability to perform a drastic timed strategy or building a sudden expansion.*

**Photon Cannon** \- now fires twice in a quick succession. Albeit at a slower pace. The damage of each projectile is also increased from 20 to 25. Overall DPS unchanged. Burst damage greatly increased.  
**Shield Battery** \- mineral cost increased from 100 to 150. Energy increased to 200.

*Protoss buildings will now be far more vulnerable to many introduced harassment and siege strategies. In order to prevent that from becoming too troublesome, we have adjusted their defensive structures.*

**Reaper** *-* added upgraded Anti-Materiel Pistols. Increases damage from 4x2 to 9x2. Requires Factory. Costs the same amount as Stimpack and researches for the same duration.

*We wanted to give the Reapers the ability to exist in the later stages of the game.*

**Widow Mine** \- now costs 50 minerals. 25 gas. Drilling Claws upgrade removed. Takes 1 supply. Health decreased from 90 to 40. Can no longer be loaded onto a Medivac nor any kind of transport unit.

*Widow Mine should not be a harassment unit and instead let that task be handled by Marines. Banshees and Hellions. We wanted it to be easier to counter with proper vision. But also far more dangerous if left unanswered. Terrans will now have the ability to make up for their limited defensive tools. Especially against newly buffed Banelings with swarms of Widow Mines.*

**Antiprotoss** \- removed all the bonuses related to bonus damage against Shields. Except the EMP ability of Ghost.

*We feel like Protoss should not be punished for their limited health. And instead rewarded for their trust in poor in armour shields and high unit costs.*

**Disruptor** *-* the explosion now does 100 damage and 100 (+400 against Buildings) damage over the duration of 5 seconds. Mineral cost increased from 150 to 350 and vespene cost increased from 150 to 250. Size increased by 100%. Added Massive to attributes. Base health and shield stats increased from 100 to 200 each. Cargo size increased to 8. Supply cost changed to 8 from 4.

*Disruptor being a spammable instant kill unit can be frustrating to deal with. So we have made it into a Colossi's equal that is more noticeable with its significant presence and prestige.*

**Mothership** *-* reverted supply and cost changes. Health and shield stats are now 400 each, instead of 250 each. Increase from 350 being the original. Given back energy stats. Cloaking Field is again a passive ability. Mass Recall renamed to Reverse Toilet. No longer summons targeted units to the Mothership. Instead it summons all nearby combat units to a targeted nearby location. Time Warp ability removed. Gave back Vortex ability. Duration decreased to 10 seconds. Range reduced to be very small. Almost beneath the Mothership.

*Ever since the removal of Vortex, the Mothership became pretty much a waste of minerals. It has no real identity in the game. And honestly sucks at everything it does. We tried giving it more damage as an experiment. But that is obviously stupid. We are very sorry for how incompetent we are. We decided to turn it into a dangerous late game unit designed to break stalemates. Its ability to dump an entire Protoss army on top of a fortified Terran position. Or immediately pull an entire Zerg army into an alternate dimension where Starcraft 3 came out after being pulled by a Viper should make it worth the great cost.*"
The Great Technological Schism: Dark Matter and Biotic Technologies in the Lumen Universe,LumenUniverse,1g94zbl,2024-10-21 20:13:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LumenUniverse/comments/1g94zbl/the_great_technological_schism_dark_matter_and/,Accurate-Broccoli-77,History,"# The Great Technological Schism and Technological Renaissance

# Overview

The **Great Technological Schism**, also known as the **Dark Matter and Biotic Renaissance Factionalization**, was a transformative period in galactic history spanning from approximately 20,000 AD to 50,000 AD. This era marked a fundamental division in technological development paths, leading to the emergence of two dominant and incompatible technological paradigms: Dark Matter technology and Biotic technology. The schism profoundly reshaped galactic society, affecting everything from interstellar politics to daily life across the nine known galaxies.

I beat Spekkio's fourth form,chronotrigger,1g8frf8,2024-10-20 22:43:04,16,0.91,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1g8frf8/i_beat_spekkios_fourth_form/,Sensitive-Hotel-9871,,"I was starting the Ocean Palace, then I realized Chrono's level was in the mid 30s so I decided to leave and give challenging Spekkio's current form, the one from level 30-39, a shot.

This one gives the feeling the Master of War is beginning to take the gloves off since he begins to use techs that hit the entire party. This one didn't seem too tough at first, especially since I gave everyone the element absorbing armor so there was a chance of his attacks healing them. I saw that the damage from his attacks could still rack up very quickly, especially given Spekkio's high speed.

I tried using the 1000 AD trio at first, making the mistake of thinking I had unlocked their triple tech. I was wrong, and also ran into the issue of Marle starting to reach her limits as a healer with single target heals. So I switched her out for Frog. It still took me a couple tries, especially since I didn't feel like using my best healing items on a fight you can lose. Something else I really needed to get into the mindset of is that it's better to use Chrono's Life tech than a Revive since he brings a character back with a lot more HP.

When I could I hit Spekkio with Delta Storm, that knocked off about a quarter of his HP. I didn't keep track of all the damage from every attack but I am pretty sure that did the most damage, especially since I didn't get a ton of single techs in thanks to all the time I spent trying to keep my party alive. Maxing out Chrono's speed was a big help."

Are there any macro openers that exist in SC2 where if the defender plays perfectly they still take damage?,starcraft,1g81skv,2024-10-20 11:51:50,52,0.83,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1g81skv/are_there_any_macro_openers_that_exist_in_sc2/,heavenstarcraft,(To be tagged...),"I was watching Harstem's video from last month with practice with Clem, and Clem was playing proxy reaper versus him. Maxpax was in the chat.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f02G8skrFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f02G8skrFU) 

It seems there isn't a real clear way to defend the initial reaper without losing probes. Even when microing probes Harstem is losing 2+ workers. If you lose more than 2, Clem/Harstem/Maxpax seem to believe the Terran is ahead. A lot of the games Harstem just straight up dies. Obviously, this is versus Clem, so that's a relevant factor in the build's strength, but I think if the Terran plays perfectly this is incredibly strong.

  
A successful defense to proxy reaper means : Protoss loses at most 2 probes, loses 2 chronos, delayed tech (due to early stalker investment), delayed 2nd gas, investment in zealot, loss of mining time.

It's costly for Terran of course too, due to losing marine production, but Terran gets their tech significantly faster with the build.

This had me thinking, what other openers exist in SC2 where your opponent will always lose workers, even with a perfect defense? I'm not super knowledge on ZvT or non protoss matchups, so was curious.

  
Let me set a couple ground rules 

1) Not gonna talk about all ins like 12pool drone pull or cannon rush, just a macro opener

2) Also referring to just the first 4 minutes or so of the game.

Forgive me for yapping about this, but I've been playing cross server on ping against this build and it just feels impossible so just looking for suggestions."

Hi all,

I have an Umarex Glock 17 Gen 4 that is having issues with extremely low FPS (90-150 FPS / ~0.3 Joules with 0.2s) and I am having a difficult time diagnosing the problem.

The gun sat in a pistol case for ~6 months, before which it was working great (no FPS issues before). I took it out yesterday to put some rounds through it, and saw that it was only chrono-ing at around 90 FPS with a 0.2g bb.  I spent the next few hours disassembling everything, cleaning, relubing, and comparing the internals to a working Glock 17 and got it up to 150 fps 😪.

I’m really not sure what it could be, and need some help. I’ll list below what steps I took to diagnose the issue. Any help is appreciated!

- First obvious step, I tried using different  magazines (C02, Extended Green Gas) and bbs, but the issue remained. I also have a working Glock 17 that I put the same mags & bbs through and there were no FPS issues.
- Next, I tried to rule out gunk in the system by cleaning the gun and re-lubricating the internals with Tech-T and silicone oil. While I squeezed a few more FPS out of it, it clearly wasn’t the main problem.
- I then trued to rule out “light striking” as an issue (as some people on here were saying this was a common issue with Glocks) by putting rounds through it, and it the slide generally cycled every time (I say generally because there were a few instances where it locked back when there were rounds left in the mag, or the gun wouldn’t chamber a new round but those may have been magazine-related issues).
- I swapped over the hopup, inner barrel, outer barrel, spring assembly from the working Glock 17 which did not fix the issue. It was still shooting 150 fps.
- I swapped over the entire slide from the working Glock 17 onto my Glock 17 lower which DID fix the issue.
- I tried to narrow down the issue to the nozzle or hammer, but wasn’t able to find anything obviously broken. The nozzle returns normally, there were no missing/chipped pieces on the nozzle assembly, and the rubber inside the nozzle looked intact (at least from the bottom).

Again, and help or ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks "

"[WTS] (KY) Vortex Razor HD 1-6 Knockoff/Repro, Elite Force Semi-Auto Shotgun, & AAP-01 [WTB] A wolverine bolt m or an ssg10 bolt assembly",airsoftmarket,1g7cg1m,2024-10-19 12:17:30,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/airsoftmarket/comments/1g7cg1m/wts_ky_vortex_razor_hd_16_knockoffrepro_elite/,CrispyBrother76,,"Pics:

Howdy yall,
Not looking for trades rn, college and rent aren't cheap lol. Shoot me cash offers on whatever, if it's reasonable I might take it. Also can do local pickup in Lex.

First up, I'll start with what I'm looking to buy:

Looking for a complete ssg10 bolt assembly (bolt handle not needed) to replace the gas assembly in a vsr10 platformed sniper. Or a wolverine bolt m hpa engine for a vsr10. Send me a shipped price to 40508, and be reasonable, I'm not paying near new for a used engine.

What's for sale:
(Buyer pays shipping)

1. Chrono Blaster - SOLD


2. Knockoff Vortex Razor HD 1-6 LPVO $155

Recouping some losses on this one. Long story short, I got scammed buying this on hopup, it was supposed to be a repro scope, however the mount it originally came with when I bought it was supposed to be a real Giessle mount, it was clearly a fake and it broke, the seller doubled down on it, was kinda rude, but I had just started college and didn't have the time to deal with paypal. Also hopup won't let me list it even though it's clearly marked as not authentic. It is however, a really nice fake, good external build quality, the 1x zoom is more like 1.5 or 2x, its pretty clear at low zoom but does get blurrier the further you up the magnification, the dot is slightly off center and pretty dim. However it's a very nice scope for airsoft use, and it has a killflash.

3. KWA MP7 w/ 2 mags - SOLD

4. Elite Force Semi Auto CO2 Shotgun - $140

Never fielded, almost brand new, just been tested and shot around, never used in a game. Semi auto takes CO2 in the stock. Comes with 7 shells, shoots 3 bbs at a time.

5. WE Tech Galaxy - SOLD

6. AAP-01 With Carbon Fiber Upper - $75

Project gun, got it new from a contest I won, then printed the upper, but it broke quickly. Never fielded. Doesn't work right. You'll want to get an aftermarket/replacement hammer system, and the barrel sticks up a bit, but if you're gonna replace the hopup/barrel anyway for a build, your getting a good deal, because your probably gonna replace those parts for a build anyway, and your getting a really nice upper with it, carbon fiber nylon uppers are not cheap. Comes with original mag.

Thanks :)

Predicting Deltarune: Part 16 - Chrono Trigger,u_TheQueen0fNowhere,1g6o4ah,2024-10-18 13:44:56,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheQueen0fNowhere/comments/1g6o4ah/predicting_deltarune_part_16_chrono_trigger/,TheQueen0fNowhere,,"##4: Chrono Trigger

Oh boy, I sure as hell am excited for this one.
Chrono Trigger and its sequel could be shockingly significant regarding Deltarune’s future.
They’re not very significant to the rebirth theory in particular, but there’s so much more.
For this one, you particularly want to have read my theory on Noelle and the weird route, although you really should have read them all by now.
So let us set things straight first… why these two games, is there any evidence Toby knows about or was inspired by them?
Chrono Trigger is most certainly an easy sell.
Out of the games that inspired Toby, this one has definitely flown under the radar and wasn’t mentioned a lot, however, [the Deltarune Steam page shouts it out for gameplay-related reasons in particular.](https://i.imgur.com/yXwA5Ql.png)
Most likely specifically referring to the fact that you only have a maximum of 3 party members at a time, rather than the more standard 4, as well as your team techs.
[The acts you can do together with your party members](https://imgur.com/a/3L4OXrd) are quite [reminiscent of the dual and triple techs, where you combine the effects of multiple skills into one attack,](https://imgur.com/a/E0XO8hC) using up everyone’s turn just like in Deltarune as well.
Furthermore, Chrono Trigger’s battles don’t actually have their own sprites or a unique artstyle or anything, but [they take place directly on the overworld, with the sprites just positioning themselves.](https://imgur.com/a/A7mg5Ns)
Maybe this inspired Deltarune’s smooth transitions into battles as well, where even though it [takes place in front of a backdrop, the sprites don’t change style or size and directly transition into their battle ones.](https://imgur.com/a/HH0QRQo)
Outside of that however, there is actually not much besides him also [liking the soundtrack.](https://i.imgur.com/Ox8w5vb.png)
Although Chrono Trigger is mentioned again by Toby in the Undertale anniversary stream where chapter 2 was revealed, [under interesting circumstances](https://youtu.be/rksOYId-cNA?t=4866) *(1:21:06 - 1:21:34)* that you’ve seen a few times by now.
So, we have gameplay, musical and visual inspiration, not really anything about the story, huh?
Well, at least Toby made sure to never comment on those aspects.
Trust me, once we go down this rabbit hole, that will fall into place as well.

Let me show you one more thing, however.
I feel it’s important to note that Chrono Trigger is quite the famous game, so certain things rubbing off on an indie developer is most definitely nothing new, could even happen passively from just picking it up.
However, the stuff I showed wasn’t some non-passionate inspiration by a cult classic, Toby is most definitely a huge fan of Chrono Trigger and just hasn’t been very vocal about it yet.
One bit is how he mentioned [repeatedly listening to the credits theme of Chrono Trigger,](https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/686522802694942720) already proving some nostalgia and affection for it.
I also just overall downplayed his love for the soundtrack, to be honest, as it’s [the second entry of his list of favorite game OSTs.](https://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/post/159002328951/video-games-soundtracks-i-like)
But the biggest evidence lies on his old YouTube channel FwugRadiation, which is the old username he used to go by everywhere.
A video dating back to 2011, which was also the year he dreamt of Deltarune btw, to make that timeline clear, is a Chrono Trigger one.
He made [a remix of Schala’s Theme to turn it into an appropriate boss theme for the Dream Devourer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O_lINY_fos)
I very much doubt anyone that isn’t a huge fan of the game would go out of their way to do something like this.
Especially when you also consider that this fight is basically bonus content on the DS version of Chrono Trigger, which requires a lot of dedication to even experience to begin with.
Anyway, keep Schala and the Dream Devourer in mind… it’s very important, we’ll get into it.
That is where the direct connections between Toby and Chrono Trigger end.
And let me say this… I think the fact that Toby has never shouted out Chrono Trigger, and ESPECIALLY Chrono Cross, when he talked about the works that had a great influence on him… is very deliberate, particularly when we consider the things we’ve already seen in the previous sections.
He doesn’t want you to make that connection… not yet.
Well… time to get into this, shall we?

First, it would probably be beneficial to give a little synopsis on the game, right?
Chrono Trigger might be a rather famous game, but I won’t leave you behind if you haven’t played it yet.
It initially takes place in the year 1000 and follows the 3 youths Crono, Marle and Lucca, who end up in the past through a wormhole that Lucca accidentally opened with one of her inventions.
One thing leads to another, and it turns out these wormholes are everywhere.
And after they land in a destroyed future, they find out that a giant alien parasite called “Lavos” will emerge and wipe out most of the world in the year 1999.
Determined to stop this from happening, they go through many events in history, gather allies from different eras, uncover Lavos’ origins, until they finally come face to face with it and defeat it once and for all.

Now… this doesn’t really sound anything like Undertale or Deltarune, does it?
More like Earthbound at this point really, but that’s still one degree of separation here.
You’re right, the overall story really doesn’t follow anything we know from Toby’s two games.
But that’s mostly because I left out a lot of details.
We really can skip over a lot of stuff, but there’s a significant turning point in the story, roughly 60% into the game.
Things REALLY get interesting once you arrive in the Kingdom of Zeal, 12.000 BC.
I think it’s safe to say that the vibe of the game completely shifts here.
[First you start off in a snowy and desolate area,](https://i.imgur.com/4aKjrrG.png) until you find a teleporter that brings you up into the skies.
[The Kingdom of Zeal is a near utopian floating set of islands on which the “Enlightened Ones” live,](https://i.imgur.com/ssZNLYW.png) humans who evolved to use magic.
And they’re… really the only ones getting to enjoy their utopia as well.
Meanwhile the [humans who are incapable of using magic were segregated from the rest and forced onto the cold lands on the ground, named the  “Earthbound Ones”...](https://imgur.com/a/J7akP1A) heh heh, Earthbound.
Anyway, I’m not trying to suggest Toby got his monster and human divide from this, especially because the magical beings are the ones that did the little racism here, but I just want to set the stage.

The first place you visit there immediately brings the concept of “dreams” into focus… and trust me, this is just the start.
You will immediately see [talks about dreams being turned into reality, and the focus on having dreams,](https://imgur.com/a/gfVK8Is) and we’re talking about both meanings of the word. 
It’s regarded as one of [the most significant factors when humans evolved in this universe, as well as other mentions.](https://imgur.com/a/uWANoYS)
Now, I don’t think I have to explain to you why this sudden shift to placing so much worth on dreams is important to Deltarune with everything you’ve already seen… but I’ll do it anyway!
[Dreams](https://i.imgur.com/C69lPiv.png) are clearly [set up as a major theme,](https://imgur.com/a/Ida4Aq0) hopes and dreams is also [not just the name of two songs,](https://imgur.com/a/H4m1gVu) but also [seemingly what the dark worlds manifested from,](https://imgur.com/a/vXyJtBS) and of course the events that occur there very much [appear as dreams to people,](https://imgur.com/a/kqx2zwA) even though they happened.
Speaking of, [hopes and dreams is mentioned in Chrono Trigger once too,](https://i.imgur.com/BiYjShX.png) but I don’t think that really means anything, felt I should point it out, just in case.
I also find the line from earlier about [beings born from dreams returning to them](https://i.imgur.com/pBpnEI9.png) to be very interesting, as it reminds me a lot of how [the darkners turn back into normal objects when taken out of a fountain’s range into the light world, and have to be returned.](https://imgur.com/a/EE4MNHw)
Furthermore, [this part is worth noting too,](https://i.imgur.com/xEUBuFm.png) as it reminded me of [the Last Dream’s description.](https://i.imgur.com/mB6q3e8.png)
Which, of course, is connected to Deltarune, as I told you at the start of this.
So the topics of beings from dreams and those dreams becoming real in quick succession… both certainly feel relevant to Deltarune.
One last thing I wanted to mention here is also that one of the last songs in the Chrono Trigger OST, the one playing right before the final boss as you approach it in your flying time machine, [is called “Determination”.](https://i.imgur.com/N79K6RB.png)
Just a fun little thing, but Toby being a fan of the game, and this playing during a significant moment in it, really makes me think this was where the seed of how to call the power in his own games was planted.
Or am I just going crazy over regular words?
You decide.

Now, it’s time to talk about the characters introduced in this section of the game, as they will play an important role for the rest of it, as well as for Deltarune.
The Kingdom is ruled by a queen, and a queen only, as the king has died.
[She has two children, Janus and Schala.](https://i.imgur.com/nLuLYaR.png)
Schala, there is the name again, still remember?
She plays a major role in the game, and franchise in general.
And while the name might suggest a connection to our Chara at first, I don’t quite think so.
Although I certainly believed that when I first started looking into everything.
Instead I’m here to propose that I think Schala served as a major inspiration for Noelle.
I beg you to hear me out on this one, and also keep in mind that we’re working with a sequel too, so it goes beyond Trigger.
All the reasons for why I came to this conclusion will be revealed, so have patience.
[First of all, it’s noted she possesses great magical power, something that applies to Noelle too, which is even specifically pointed out by Ralsei in a strangely unused cutscene.](https://imgur.com/a/SLMQKHj)
People also [assume that she must be living in opulence due to her status and powers, while we know that’s not the case, which also lines up perfectly with Noelle, the daughter of the mayor](https://imgur.com/a/2YnTpx6) (although her mom is probably just scratching the surface of her not-so-perfect-life).
Personality-wise, she can very easily fit Noelle here, being kind and gentle, but also shy and demure.
Most notably, she is very easily controlled by others and forced to do things she doesn’t want to do, [just like Noelle.](https://imgur.com/a/uxAZ9O7)
From her mother, to [her mother’s advisor](https://imgur.com/a/OR1D1sT) and even [her future brother in disguise.](https://imgur.com/a/6aLz72Y)
Huh, would you look at that… [interesting sprite they keep using on her after she’s forced into these situations.](https://imgur.com/a/2AvuIWh)

And of course, things get interesting once we throw the queen into the mix.
As you can probably assume, I’m also suggesting here that the queen of Zeal, Queen Zeal, is indeed also what could have inspired Noelle’s mother.
Seems far-fetched, seeing as we haven’t met the mayor as of now, but enough information is revealed to already raise some eyebrows at potential parallels.
The most interesting thing to consider is Queenm however… I mean, our Queen, Deltarune Queen.
I already talked about the incredibly popular theory that Queen in chapter 2 represents Noelle’s mother, in both her relationship to Noelle and how she treats her.
And while that isn’t confirmed, there’s an incredible amount of reasons to believe that this is the case, which, to refresh you on it, [also would make for good storytelling by hinting at their potential dynamic.](https://imgur.com/a/t8n4fQt)
Although [Schala standing up to her mom certainly didn’t end as well.](https://imgur.com/a/VhPnhra)
But then again, Noelle was only standing up to the dark world version of her mother too, who knows how it will go in real life?
So if you consider all of that, and apply everything that Queen did in chapter 2 to the mayor… it paints a pretty bad picture of Noelle’s mother.
Could even bring forth the idea that all of [Noelle’s top academic behavior is pushed onto her by the mayor too, as she’d rather just play video games with her dad or be more of a rebel like Susie, potentially including LESS unassuming and plain clothing.](https://imgur.com/a/inKn0yQ)
Regardless, once you take Cyber World Queen into consideration, it opens up [a lot more parallels that Noelle’s mother, who we will just call Mayor, has to Queen Zeal now too, even though there’s already a bunch.](https://imgur.com/a/D6SdIwf)
We see all the controlling behavior Queen exhibited in chapter 2, which also translates to the Mayor, and see how Schala experiences similar things at the hands of Queen Zeal.
Most concerning of all are the very worrying predictions you can make from this, like what [the Mayor could do to her daughter in the future,](https://imgur.com/a/G1jEfo5) and Noelle has [already experienced similar things with Queen.](https://imgur.com/a/RQsm3EY)

This could easily translate to the Mayor actually being aware of the dark worlds, or becoming aware of them, and later forcing Noelle to continue opening more fountains.
After all, it’s not hard to believe that the Mayor, who has lost one of her daughters and will soon lose her husband, would like to summon something that can make everyone, especially her, [live in a world of dreams, just like Deltarune Queen and Queen Zeal.](https://imgur.com/a/kV9VzSd)
Especially if there is of course the hope that it could maybe even bring them back.
Speculation on the Mayor is just always hard to do, but maybe that’s the kind of role she’ll end up playing, which could make her a potentially much more central character than I had originally anticipated.
And Queen would end up being almost just a quirky and friendlier teaser for the bigger and real threat that’s to come.
I have always believed that the Knight is only going to be a temporary main antagonist and will later be replaced by the Angel, which I obviously consider to be Noelle, and the people who got her to this point.
Considering that Queen Zeal, [solely thanks to Schala’s magical power,](https://i.imgur.com/0ceTHI2.png) does actually manage to eventually cause the end of the world until they’re stopped, it’s not hard to believe that we might see a similar scenario to this in Deltarune, and the Mayor will be the ultimate push for Noelle to bring forth the Roaring.
However, just like in the Chrono games, I think that the Mayor isn’t going to be the last big bad, and the final confrontation is going to be with Noelle instead, but let’s get into that later.
Speaking of that confrontation, [Queen Zeal actually had a second and final confrontation, a boss battle that visually reminded me of Giga Queen’s non-combat appearances too…](https://imgur.com/a/vvyx6FE) just thought it was worth bringing up.

There’s one more part of the Zeal family that I should mention.
As I said earlier, the king of the Zeal family died, which also brings up [a parallel to the sick Rudy,](https://imgur.com/a/K6KVXQ3) who’s seemingly [destined to die if Undertale is any indication.](https://imgur.com/a/oiYDe6L)
Besides the King’s death being one of the reasons that the Queen was able to be drawn in by Lavos’ power, it also brings up another question for us.
If even the post-mortem character of King Zeal has a parallel character in Deltarune, then what does this mean for Janus, [the other child of Queen Zeal and Schala’s little brother?](https://i.imgur.com/nLuLYaR.png)
He’s the only member I haven’t properly talked about yet.
Even though he might seem insignificant at first, he’s actually later [revealed to be the demon lord Magus many years after he was sent back in time,](https://imgur.com/a/udk1VYD) where he fulfilled the role of the [primary antagonist in the first half of the game.](https://i.imgur.com/DzvzpIQ.png)
He even ends up [joining the heroes in the end depending on your decision,](https://imgur.com/a/vCA80a9) due to their [common goal of destroying Lavos, which he viciously pursues.](https://imgur.com/a/OXsjjmU)
He’s a main character, so with that significance you’d also expect him to have a parallel in Deltarune then too, right?
Like being Dess for example.
But it just… very obviously doesn’t work.
And I know that makes it sound really selective, but I just don’t think Janus really translates to Deltarune.
Well, I think elements do, but not as a full character, he’s too complex and specific for that.

First of those elements might be, just throwing out a good guess, that he could have somewhat inspired the Knight.
Janus as Magus was [summoning Lavos in order to challenge and defeat him,](https://i.imgur.com/7ZRYIEF.png) but our heroes assumed he was drawing Lavos out for evil reasons, which would also later destroy the planet.
But then it turns out that [Janus’ actions here were neither the cause of destruction, but not even where Lavos first appeared.](https://imgur.com/a/TlDoxns)
This would mean despite a lot of terrible things Janus might have done for his quest, that I won’t all get into, he was trying to get his revenge and rid the world of Lavos.
A misunderstanding and situation that could repeat itself with the Knight, who’s potentially not fully aware of the consequences their actions could have and [think they’re doing something holy or noble, certainly not ending the world.](https://imgur.com/a/8PafR0U)
In the end, they might also not even be the one to cause the Roaring in the first place, and it’s the Angel instead.
I’ve already gotten into it in the past, that it’s very clear that the “Roaring” event and the “Angel’s Heaven” are, if not one and the same, directly linked and an outcome of each other.
Which would make their title of [“Roaring” Knight](https://i.imgur.com/LqY9Bep.png) fittingly ironic, unless that title is a red herring and is simply a nickname that was given to them by Queen for their personality, as [she had no idea the Roaring existed but seemingly observed the Knight quite a bit.](https://imgur.com/a/BQ2djjh)
Anyway, [disguised as the Prophet](https://imgur.com/a/cy0RLkA) while using his future knowledge, [Janus guided the Queen as her new advisor on harnessing the power of Lavos in order to summon it again, so that he has a second shot at defeating it before it even caused any destruction,](https://i.imgur.com/jop4EiO.png)
The Knight could easily be doing something similar here, regardless of their intentions.
They’re also a strong antagonistic force for most of the game, but I suspect that, just like Janus, the Knight won’t be an antagonist all the way to the end, and for all we know, might even end up on your side at some point.

Now, enough of the Knight, because what else did Janus inspire?
After all, we already established he doesn’t have a full character parallel in Deltarune.
Well, Janus is the younger sibling, yet Dess is the older one, and Noelle is absolutely nothing like Janus at all, so that’s a problem.
And of course, from everything we know about Dess, that doesn’t fit either.
Personality-wise at least, his main goal, besides defeating Lavos, is finding his sister Schala again.
After an encounter in the Ocean Palace of Zeal where she was forced to reawaken Lavos by the queen, [Schala uses the last of her strength to teleport the heroes to safety and is then not seen again.](https://imgur.com/a/dC9MPsP)
Since then, Janus has been desperately trying to reunite with his sister, giving him even more drive than his desire to kill Lavos ever could.
And we do know that Noelle has been searching for her sister Dess too, who has seemingly gone missing, all the stuff we should be familiar with by now.
So as you might be noticing here, it really does seem to me like Noelle might be a mishmash of both Schala and Janus in a way, although still primarily Schala.
And of course that there’s no real parallel character to Janus, or specifically one that Dess could have been inspired by.
It’s just the dynamic and concepts, and the idea of being in search of a character, which will all continue in Chrono Cross as well, btw.
It’s for sure no minor part of the story, and [the most memorable and tragic aspect of Janus.](https://imgur.com/a/cvvo7A4)
But as a character by itself, I definitely still think Schala and Noelle are a clear fit.
I would like to reiterate that if you still believe this connection between the Holiday and Zeal family is too much of a leap, especially with Noelle and Schala, then you should know that this is still just the beginning.
Especially the idea that Toby took great inspiration from the games in general, we’ll get there… Chrono Cross is fun.
Anyway, I mentioned earlier that Janus was sent back in time, correct?
Well, returning to that and how it happened is actually also going to be important, as it ties into the next section of this..
The story of Schala will continue, oh, how it will continue… but we need to take a little detour and look at some other characters from the Kingdom of Zeal section that are… very, very interesting.

&nbsp;

**End of Time**

The Kingdom of Zeal has 3 Gurus.
[Melchior, the Guru of Life, Belthasar, the Guru of Reason, and Gaspar, the Guru of Time.](https://i.imgur.com/4Y7dsMj.png)
If that last one concerns you in particular, then I can only say that… it should, because we’re definitely going there.
The three are said to each represent a vital aspect of existence.
Originally acting basically just as advisors to Queen Zeal, they were given a much bigger purpose after an accident occured when Queen Zeal activated a machine against their will to draw out Lavos’ full power.
[That accident wasn’t just how Janus ended up being sent through time, but each of the gurus was sucked into different time periods](https://imgur.com/a/g5Kx5JB) as well.
[Melchior ended up in what’s called the “present”, as the game starts there, Belthasar ended up in the future after Lavos already ravaged the planet, and most notably Gaspar gets sent to the end of time.](https://imgur.com/a/cDSvklf)
I have neglected to mention the end of time so far, but [here it is.](https://imgur.com/a/6nZRhkd)
Pretty much the closest thing the game has to a hub world.
Now… I’ll spit it out and not beat around the bush, yes, I think Gaspar inspired Gaster.
And it’s not just the name, of course.
The situation Gaspar finds himself in very much reminds me of how Gaster shattered across time and space, and [the background of the character creation even reminds me visually of the End of Time.](https://imgur.com/a/5t337V2)
While Gaspar might have not been responsible for the event himself, an accident occurred when playing with immeasurable power, [like how Gaster’s blueprints show he was extracting and researching on determination,](https://imgur.com/a/uYtlaw5) and he was ripped out of his current spot in time to end up in something beyond it, [also very much like Gaster.](https://imgur.com/a/B38MVSZ)
And regarding the “not responsible himself” part… I’ll have something to add to that in the Chrono Cross section later. 
However, we’re far from done yet.
No, Gaspar also worked on a special project, one that also involved his disappearance from the public… [he worked on something he calls the Time Egg, aka the Chrono Trigger itself.](https://imgur.com/a/SR70XQB)
Yes… egg… yes… you heard me right… the potential inspiration of Gaster… has an item that gives the game its namesake… [and it’s a goddamn egg, received far away from everything else.](https://imgur.com/a/l9hfhW1)
Excuse me for, uhm, possibly jumping the shark and making the wildest assumption anybody has ever seen… but I kinda don’t feel like this is a coincidence either?
Because… eggs not really often used in stories, I think… kinda, maybe.

Anyway, to bring you up to speed a little, [the main protagonist, Crono, actually ends up dying during the first encounter with Lavos,](https://imgur.com/a/pEEheFE) where Schala teleports the remaining survivors out and goes missing, as shown earlier.
While you can actually end the game with Crono being dead, there is a sidequest you can do after a while in which you bring Crono back to life, which the game incentivizes.
It requires many steps, one of which is… [getting a life-sized doll of Crono…](https://i.imgur.com/S8yhPDy.png) don’t ask.
Crono sacrificing himself and dying there [is apparently not part of the original timeline, and the Time Egg supposedly is able to bring him back and allow them to restore it.](https://imgur.com/a/pVyfPPW)
By traveling back into that frozen moment in time, [they replace the Crono that got killed with the doll, pull the real one out of there, and essentially manage to trick fate, you could say.](https://imgur.com/a/rKObSLH)
It’s dumb, but cool.
Also interesting that the specific idea of overcoming death is brought up again, just like how Queen Zeal, one of the main antagonists, wanted to do that, and just like how I suspect that could factor into mayor Holiday’s motivations too and might also be what kickstarts Noelle’s descend, should she attempt to bring Rudy and even potentially Dess back.
Not to mention after dedicating a theory to Kris where a huge part revolves around them commiting suicide… also a bad sign that this game’s main character threw himself into certain death to save someone.
However, let’s get back to the egg.
The Time Egg is used at the summit of Death Peak, at which you just got to have a look at already.
Using the egg right there… [it certainly reminds me of the area in which you get your first egg in Deltarune.](https://imgur.com/a/kpbxVIP)
The tree at the summit even [returns in one of the endings where you don’t revive Crono, surrounded by complete darkness…](https://imgur.com/a/zC0FAJ0) another striking and similar visual.
I find it very hard to believe that this is a coincidence, it can’t be, not after everything else.
[The way Gaspar talks here even reminds me of Gaster, and makes him out to be a “chessmaster” that puts all the pieces that are needed into place, but doesn’t actually play and take direct action to change the future himself, instead letting a few select people and the power of friendship do it.](https://imgur.com/a/ultGsrn)
Something that [very much seems like it could apply to everything we’ve seen of Gaster in Deltarune so far,](https://imgur.com/a/rHLXtCt) although Gaster does almost seem a bit more involved again.
However, there is of course another question that arises… what about the other gurus?

And man, there’s really a ton of stuff you can say here.
Because as you know… Gaster kinda does have two characters that we know are related to him due to their font naming scheme.
[Sans is also into science and very knowledgeable,](https://imgur.com/a/9Amf2vC) making him a good fit for Belthasar, the Guru of Reason, who is also the one that [built the flying time machine “Epoch” and tons of other technological achievements you encounter in the game.](https://imgur.com/a/oGneQJe)
Papyrus meanwhile always [tries to keep you on the straight and narrow, dislikes violence and is also the only enemy who can’t kill you in the entire game (outside the dummy).](https://imgur.com/a/Ypu0yI4)
Sounds like a good fit for Melchior, the Guru of Life, who, despite his talent of forging equipment, dislikes that it’s used for the sake of taking the lives of others.
Of course, Gaster is seemingly the only one that was displaced in a similar way to a guru.
Although there is [actual evidence towards Sans and Papyrus not belonging and just appearing one day,](https://imgur.com/a/SmzMehH) but not only are the brothers together, which none of the gurus are, but their case is clearly not as substantial as Gaster who seems to have straight up been erased from the world, which does seem very similar to how Gaspar ended up at the end of time in his game.
I will not fault you in the slightest if you believe the 3 font bros are a nod to the gurus regardless, and I honestly think that Toby might have intended that or had the thought at some point… but there’s one thing that throws a wrench into this, which is that I think Gaster is probably more of a merge between Gaspar AND Belthasar.
The reason for this is… that the story of Belthasar doesn’t end with Chrono Trigger, but continues with Chrono Cross, which also means I’ll have to elaborate on this later.
Trust me, you’ll realize why I couldn’t accept the simple solution of the 3 skelebros being the 3 gurus, or at least why this couldn’t have been where the inspiration ends.
Or maybe the 3 gurus parallel was only just the original intention, and Toby changed his mind… something that wouldn’t be unusual in the slightest.
Regardless, this 3 guru idea is not something I’ll continue to pursue.

The stuff left to cover is actually pretty interesting, because it directly leads into Chrono Cross too.
Remember how we started all of this?
[With the remix Toby made of the Dream Devourer boss?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O_lINY_fos)
Well, it’s finally relevant now.
That was content added in the DS version of Chrono Trigger, which was released years after Chrono Cross, with the bonus content intended to be a tie-in to the second game.
You can access it after beating the game at least once and reloading the file, which allows you to do a few sidequests in dimensional vortexes.
Once you’ve done them all, you’ll get [the option to face the Dream Devourer at Time’s Eclipse, or more appropriately the “Darkness At The End Of Time”,](https://imgur.com/a/uQ78OfY) which is where discarded timelines go after history has been rewritten.
A concept I should note is very interesting, as there could be potential ways such a place exists in the Deltarune and even Undertale universe.
Not only is there [seemingly some afterlife that’s hinted at that Asriel experienced before he came back as Flowey,](https://imgur.com/a/ATjIg2Q) one which seems to consist of pure darkness, [with Chara’s own appearance](https://i.imgur.com/99GkZnn.png) not helping this case in the slightest. 
To add onto that, there’s even further [hidden dialogue in the script of Deltarune referencing such a place and someone being lost in it, even coming up once with Spamton,](https://imgur.com/a/t3VSnE5) as indicated by the Japanese version apparently having identical speech as the hidden monologue found in the script.
Also… [Gaster himself seemingly makes his entrance on Twitter in a place like it.](https://i.imgur.com/5KT3z1Q.png)
This whole idea of things being discarded... if the “Darkness At The End Of Time” is where discarded timelines go, then this darkness in Deltarune could be where just anything discarded ends up, in this case people.
Furthermore, [messing with timelines, including the act of deleting them, is acknowledged by the mysterious narrator who is most likely Gaster,](https://imgur.com/a/zFSoQfZ) making this a possible story element.
So who’s to say this darkness doesn’t include timelines after all?
Isn’t that what I said the Goners were in my rebirth theory, remnants of the erased Deltarune world?
[The vessel you created is discarded too, aptly named goner,](https://imgur.com/a/o1zuSy3) so yeah… I would keep an eye on this concept of some kind of darkness acting as a universal trash bin, including how it relates to Gaster.

But back to this whole thing… [what is the Dream Devourer](https://imgur.com/a/efAtwKw) and what does Schala have to do with it?
The accepted story is that, since Schala isn’t seen anymore after the events of the Ocean Palace, that she must have somehow been sucked into a dimensional vortex.
And there, the Lavos from the year 1999, where it was supposed to destroy the world, was also put there since that timeline has been erased through the heroes defeating it.
Once Schala arrived, Lavos fused with her to leech of her great magical powers that were already used on itself beforehand, which makes sense as Lavos is essentially just an alien parasite.
As you travel to that place you also [encounter an alternate version of Janus, introducing parallel and alternate universes to the world, sounds pretty relevant to us, all while the dream mentions amplify.](https://imgur.com/a/TzDjmRO)
You then find the Dream Devourer, and [this proceeding dialogue from Schala really worried me.](https://imgur.com/a/rnCmqjc)
To bring it back to my theory about Noelle, if you still remember from my theories, I don’t see things ending well for her.
I believe that she will be too mentally unwell to wish for a better future when bringing forth the Angel’s Heaven, when even someone as unhinged as [Queen had a better and clear idea in mind](https://imgur.com/a/3RqOiKp) for expanding the dark world.
And if Noelle isn’t stopped, the new future that will emerge from her hopes and dreams [is simply just a pure dark void of nothingness, because it’s the only painless future she can envision…](https://imgur.com/a/cx663kx) which is why we need someone else’s Heaven.
If you don’t pull it off, [Noelle will succeed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j1avzXu3DY)
It’s a lot like how Schala herself welcomes the end of existence, as I showed just now, and it becomes even more evident with [the way the whole fight ends and she regains her consciousness for a brief moment,](https://imgur.com/a/P7fJKyt) making me think we could get a confrontation like that with Noelle too.
Including the idea that you might not be able to save her, just like Undertale’s Angels Asriel and Chara couldn’t be, who were both in a state that they couldn’t recover from.
However you can still save the world and everyone else.
It goes without saying that, considering Toby made an entire banger remix for this fight, that this moment definitely stuck with him.
In fact, [listen to it again, because it’s just that good…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O_lINY_fos) I will NOT stop posting it!

The whole “Dream Devourer” name in general is something that might make a lot of clogs turn just by itself when taking Deltarune into consideration.
Even [its goddamn attacks are so reminiscent of Deltarune.](https://imgur.com/a/qj2h0UU)
Anyway, it’s time to wrap up all the Chrono Trigger stuff, so here’s some more miscellaneous things I came across that I just wanted to bring up.
I already showed them earlier, but here they are again for good measure… [a bunch of instances where dreams are mentioned.](https://imgur.com/a/uWANoYS) 
I tried to take note of every time it happened… like a complete maniac, just because I wanted to hammer that one home.
On that note as well, I just found a lot of NPC interactions, the way the world is made to feel alive and shapes itself around your choices, to just give me Undertale vibes.
I could easily see how Toby took inspiration from the game to make his world feel equally as alive and ever-changing depending on what you do, even if it isn’t through time travel.
Also, [the theme of rebirth is brought up once in a more harmless context.](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5QTP3.png)
However, that leads me to another thing.
The game actually makes a parallel to the birth of Jesus and his resurrection.
The three Gurus, Gaspar, Belthasar and Melchior, [are named after the three magi from the bible,](https://i.imgur.com/HraMU9o.png) who visited Jesus during his birth and each gave him an object as a gift.
That’s reminiscent of how all three gurus help Crono and friends during their quest by providing crucial items.
Melchior the Masamune, Belthasar the Epoch, and Gaspar the Time Egg/Chrono Trigger.
Of course, the last one is notable because it’s what allows you to save the deceased Crono.
So you could make the argument that Crono was resurrected, just like Jesus, considering the magi reference was already made.
I thought it was worth bringing up for this because Deltarune is also a game that’s heading towards religion being a big part of it, so I just found it interesting.
And of course you could say the whole deal with Jesus and Crono is yet another thing to add to our list of the many rebirths related to Deltarune.
Another thing that I still have lying around is this, and I’m not sure what to do with it, but wanted to bring it up regardless.
[Fate and destiny are a big thing in these games,](https://imgur.com/a/5Z5Mz5O) particularly the act of defying such a thing, which is basically what Crono and the rest are doing the entire game, and we’ll be looking at that even more for the sequel.
Defying fate seems relevant to Deltarune… which also brings me to the last thing here.
One thing that I wish I could have figured out how to better include, too.
You can actually get a very unique game over in the game if you lose to Lavos specifically.
Since their whole goal is to defeat Lavos and change the course of history, [the game over when you die to Lavos is appropriately changed to something more sinister.](https://imgur.com/a/MLMMYfs)
And that strongly reminds me of [the inevitable fate that seems to be awaiting the world of Deltarune, as you’re also reminded of when you give up after receiving a game over.](https://imgur.com/a/oAG6OEe)

So, this is it.
This was all the Chrono Trigger stuff worth covering.
And, did you come out thinking that this all wasn’t sufficient enough to assume an unrelated franchise may have inspired Undertale and Deltarune to the point that Toby borrowed elements from it?
Yes?
Well… good thing we’re far from done here, soooo far from done!
I spoke confidently about assuming that Toby very much doesn’t openly talk about these two games being a huge inspiration for him, most likely because he’s aware of how much he borrowed from them and doesn’t want people to figure out plot points of Deltarune through them… and I maintain that.
Chrono Trigger had quite a bit of stuff, but probably doesn’t manage to stand on its own feet by itself, so I’m thankful that this is just the prologue baby, the real fun starts now.
Chrono Cross, by concept alone, is already much more relevant to what Deltarune could be.
And if you don’t look at both of these things combined and come to the same conclusion as me, you must be really hard to convince of anything.
No more distractions now, the time has come…

Howdy yall,
Not looking for trades rn, college and rent aint cheap lol. Shoot me cash offers on whatever, if it's reasonable I might take it. Also can do local pickup in Lex.

First up, I'll start with what I'm looking to buy:

Looking for a complete ssg10 bolt assembly (bolt handle not needed) to replace the gas assembly in a vsr10 platformed sniper. Or a wolverine bolt m hpa engine for a vsr10. Send me a shipped price to 40508, and be reasonable, I'm not paying near new for a used engine.

What's for sale:
(Buyer pays shipping)

1. Chrono Blaster $650

Excellent shape. Never fielded. Lights and electronics all work. Two minor flaws, it only shoots full auto, and its missing the little sliding door for the bbs at the top of the magazine. Keep in mind, these are more of a collectors piece, the gearbox and electronics are notorious for going out quickly. So if they stop working on you, I'm not responsible. I can ship it in the original box. Comes with the gun and 1 mag.


2. Knockoff Vortex Razor HD 1-6 LPVO $155

Recouping some losses on this one. Long story short, I got scammed buying this on hopup, it was supposed to be a repro scope, however the mount it originally came with when I bought it was supposed to be a real Giessle mount, it was clearly a fake and it broke, the seller doubled down on it, was kinda rude, but I had just started college and didn't have the time to deal with paypal. Also hopup won't let me list it even though it's clearly marked as not authentic. It is however, a really nice fake, good external build quality, the 1x zoom is more like 1.5 or 2x, its pretty clear at low zoom but does get blurrier the further you up the magnification, the dot is slightly off center and pretty dim. However it's a very nice scope for airsoft use, and it has a killflash.

3. KWA MP7 w/ 2 mags - $275

Fielded once. No sign of the receiver crack at all. Works great, just has the original bolt so it shoots hard and hops hard, so use really heavy bbs unless you put a cqb bolt in. Missing the little front plastic cap, seems like they commonly fall out, it fell out on me and I lost it. Comes with 2 mags total, solid gun.

4. Elite Force Semi Auto CO2 Shotgun - $140

Never fielded, almost brand new, just been tested and shot around, never used in a game. Semi auto takes CO2 in the stock. Comes with 7 shells, shoots 3 bbs at a time.

5. WE Tech Galaxy - SOLD

6. AAP-01 With Carbon Fiber Upper - $75

Project gun, got it new from a contest I won, then printed the upper, but it broke quickly. Never fielded. Doesn't work right. You'll want to get an aftermarket/replacement hammer system, and the barrel sticks up a bit, but if you're gonna replace the hopup/barrel anyway for a build, your getting a good deal, because your probably gonna replace those parts for a build anyway, and your getting a really nice upper with it, carbon fiber nylon uppers are not cheap. Comes with original mag.

Thanks :)

"If Chrono Trigger were to get a re-release with more modern mechanical updates, here's what I'd do.",chronotrigger,1g3mlpj,2024-10-14 14:14:29,0,0.29,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1g3mlpj/if_chrono_trigger_were_to_get_a_rerelease_with/,darkdill,,"Chrono Trigger is a timeless classic, but some of its mechanics are admittedly outdated, and the game certainly isn't that difficult. New Game+ further muddies things, as with enough grinding you can render several accessories largely useless, and even some Double or Triple techs can get power-crept by Single techs.

So, if CT were to get a re-release and was given a balance workover, here's what I'd do:

* Change the party's maximum HP to 9,999 and maximum SP to 999. Readjust various tech costs, healing effects, etc., in relation to these new caps. Having higher caps makes things a lot more flexible to balance.
* Adjust various other numbers across all party members. Robo is OP, Frog is UP, etc., in late-game fights, so they should all be adjusted so every character is (relatively) equally viable at all stages of the game.
* Change various Double and Triple techs so that they deal multiple hits. The 9,999 damage cap can often be obstructive, and with enough grinding you can get various Single techs like Flare to hit the cap, making those Double/Triple techs less useful. To make Double/Triple techs more useful, they should hit multiple times, making the damage cap less of a problem (i.e. with enough setup you could deal 3x9,999 to all enemies with a Triple tech).
* Add some debuffs and/or status effects onto certain Double/Triple techs. Most Double/Triple techs are just damage with different animations and hitboxes, so changing some of them to inflict debuffs and/or status effects could add an extra level of strategy to the mix. For example, a Double tech that lowers the enemy's damage output would be very useful.
* Add in selectable difficulty settings. CT is honestly fairly easy, so having access to harder difficulty levels would surely appeal to veterans and players who want a challenge.
* Remove the requirement to use the Rock accessories for certain Triple techs. Change them to have some other effect (i.e. increasing a certain element's damage).
* Give Magus some Double techs and more Triple techs. I know he's a loner and an optional party member, but I'd still give him some combos with the others.

I'll add more if I can think of it. What do you think of these changes?"

When he talked about trying out the magic techs my characters gained I thought this would just be a tutorial or something so I wasn't healed from the factory and he kicked my ass. The fight certainly showed the importance of using magic because based on Chrono's counter attacks not hitting Spekkio, it doesn't look like physical attacks work on his second stage form. Not that having magic did me much good the first time because Spekkio hits leaps and bounds harder than anything you encounter before him.

Fortunately, you get to walk out with full HP and MP regardless of the outcome. This wasn't just the first time I lost a fight, it was the first time one of my characters got KOed. I came back with Marle to get her magic and when Spekkio gave me the option of fighting him again, I beat him and got a Magic Tab. I used the Magic Tab on Robo. I like what his techniques can do, even if they are lacking in power now, so I see what people are talking about when they say how strong he becomes if you are willing to invest the time to raise his magic stat. So when I level up I plan to return for more magic tabs."

Chrono Break: if it happens what is your idea for this universe,chronotrigger,1g1laem,2024-10-11 18:00:40,5,0.62,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1g1laem/chrono_break_if_it_happens_what_is_your_idea_for/,This_Profession_9676,,"To be honest if it would be made i think we get a new set of characters. New Story just like chrono cross. And that is okay. Jusz give us throwbacks or even some old characters returning. But what do you think could such a game give us? 
Here are some ideas: 

Balthasar oversees chronopolis having fullfilled project kid and knowing how chronopolis got send to the past hindering it from such an Event. Instead i imagine chronopolis getting send to the end of time so its uneffected by changes in time and beeing able to oversee all the timelines. The game starts with a silent protagonist who idk has a Robot friend (who later becomes a capable fighter) at chronopolis. He grew up there and Balthasar is smth like a mentor. 

Balthasar became obsessed with the thought of creating a perfect timeline (kinda like how in chrono trigger you can end the Story without fionas forest and saving luccas mom...but its more joyful). I Imagine a society actively deleting Bad shit that happens around history. In one Instance the protagonist gets accidently send back to 610 ad and meets Glenn. He Teaches him how to use a sword and how to fight (tutorial) and gets the protagonist hyped to become a time traveler who wants the best outcome to happen. 

The game could heavily go into the human desire of wanting things to have a different outcome and regret. Besides learning how some mistakes have to happen for US to grow. Also the Missions could be fun considering they all take place in various Times. Maybe a Mechanic of the game is to see how your actions impact the timeline. So you maybe have created something which no one could have predicted. This leads to a timeline where the time devourer wins against serge. So he absorbs him too. He evolves and becomes a beeing beyond comprehension. More humanoid maybe even able to speak. A beeing like lavos expressing himself seems like an opportunity to have a all knowing Mastermind as a final Boss. I can see him creating a completely different timeline where he creates a perfect universe to Harvest energy from. 

So now we need a good fucking Team to defeat him. We meet glenn and he helps us out recruiting the strongest warriors across time. I imagine lavos having chronopolis under his control so we have the neo epoch. 
I can see chronopolis becoming a Dungeon filled with monsters for our Team to conquer. 

Robo is part of chronopolis but is also waiting 400 years because of fiona. He could be activated. Because of glenn we meet up with crono Lucca and marle who suggest magus and ayla. So we Pick up ayla and find out what magus is up to these days. It turns out He lost his memories and became gil. They found out and meet up with serge kid and gil who all Team up given the Circumstances. Magus gains back his knowledge and we witness a man who has now lived 2 very different lives. 

So now having so many heroes Lucca makes changes to the neo epoch so it can Transport all these characters

Protagonist, who can use magic and elements. He is a sword fighter with two swords. Each, left and right, can be equipped individually. His two best swords are each made out of pure magic and the other pure elemental Power. 

Robotic friend of protagonist. He is the MVP of all as He can do it all. Heal, Defense, attack, explosions.... He is like a chilled out robo. 

I imagine schala has been found by Balthasar and she totally should be playable. Heavy healing and defense 

Crono, Lucca, marle, robo, glenn, ayla, magus, kid, serge 

We find ourselves in chronopolis drastically changed and the Team gets Divided. We now have to make our teams. 12 characters means 4 teams. Imagine. You can have a Team of 3 silent protagonists. Or the Interaction between  kid and schala. Kid having to face the truth she will in her timeline become schala 

At the end they all meet with lavos and we have an Epic really long battle with him using all 12 characters. Imagine such a battle. We can freely use all of our triple techs. 
At the end we see them all uniting in one epic attack. 

With lavos killed chronopolis Returns back to Normal and everyone goes back. Serge magus and kid still have to defeat the time devourer from there timeline or else this happens again. In the end we get a new timeline and happy end. Except maybe serge kid and magus since They all forget this shit happens.

Notes

* Chronos, as you may have guessed, is a psychologic drug that is the root of all these skills. It is extremely expensive and it's recipe is a government secret. You may have noticed that At a Beat of the Heart has 2 separate reloads. One is the mask tanks, which grants 1 minute of use per tank, and need to be refilled. The other is the Chronos gauge, which also is depleted with power uses: activating it 3 separate times will make it last less than if you use the 4 minutes in one go (since you only spend half/min if you keep instead of reactivate). For each minute you'll need to make a HT+2 (from Very Fit) roll to deal with the accelerated heart rate. If you let it deactivate, or ran out of juice, you'll get Reduced Time Rate for 10 mins after a while.
* Since Chronos is so rare, her main setting gimmick is that those who have the power over it basically can make her do anything they want. She would die of withdrawal with basically no chance of surviving if she doesn't obey, after all, and wouldn't find it anywhere else. Being isolated mid-mission or having her supply destroyed/lost for any reason is, to me, one very narratively interesting stress situation where she would be not only powerless, but actively dying.
* In my idea she's an ex-general, that got deposed after the end of an uninspecified war. Since then, to survive, she became a elite hitman from the government, tasked with all kinds of works in exchange for a Chronos supply. That is very reflavourable though, with the quirks and what-nots.
* She carries 2 Micro-Uzis and some packs of extended ammo, flechette and hollow-point (I think that's the name of it), a trench knife, a concealable vest and a handful of stun grenades. She mostly uses her speed to blindingly stun masses and wreck the vulnerable parts of the enemy side (intel, command, etc.). She also still remember one thing or another on how to coordinate a team. But that's just one idea on how to use her kit. Go nuts!
* Yes, it's very inspired in Katana Zero, mainly on Headhunter (not zero lol). Enjoy!"

Addendum between information section and item list.*

Getting out of the hobby as a whole and I am going to be moving soon so I'm selling my entire collection. No trades for anything other than N scale model railroad stuff if anyone else here is even enough of a nerd for that. Local pickup preferred, especially on the rifles, but I can ship domestically. I am currently located near San Bernardino, California. Listed prices are just ""ideal"" for me, I am more than willing to take offers, I mostly just need these gone asap. Prices are flexible, just don't lowball me *too* hard. Listed prices do not factor in shipping, if shipping is high for a particular item, I'll bump down the price a bit more if needed.

Most of this has never been fielded, generally only used a couple times for plinking so most things will be like-new. Any defects will be specified, though they will be cosmetic. Unless otherwise stated, everything here functions as normal, has been tested, and has stock internals aside from lighter springs in a couple of the AEGs with quick change gearboxes. Not sure which ones have swapped springs however, I don't have a chrono to check them.

Will gladly provide additional photos if needed, just ask.

If anything happens and a purchased item is not as described, please reach out to me and I will try to rectify it.

Rsham Arena Cheat Sheet,worldofpvp,1fqtqn5,2024-09-27 13:51:44,25,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/1fqtqn5/rsham_arena_cheat_sheet/,InformalMeal9828,Discussion,"Hello all I started playing rsham in DF S4 and continued into the new xpac. Got to 1950 in SS rn but looking for some extra tips and techs to help me keep pushing. I thought I’d lay out how I play vs other specs and if anyone can help add tips I’d really appreciate it. I don’t play anything except Rsham so any insight to how beat specs that I’m not aware of is appreciated TY! 

Feral- Usually kill target, dbl ET open. I’ll play totemic if I have dbl melee or a turret caster. Save kicks for clones and try to root/static him off.

Rogues- similar to feral plus I’ll pickup poison totem. I go totemic a lot vs rogues bc there’s much more passive healing when my team is in healing rain and I get cc chained. 

Warriors- usually just a 1 stream + 1 ET reset open. I’ve been playing a lot of CS totem into warrs and melee cleave and just moving CS around so they can’t kill it. Again root/static to control. Try to bait reflect out with hexes. 

Devo- I feel like I play very poorly vs dragons. I try to save kick for offensive spells like disintegrate and use grounding/tremor for sleep walk. I think not using kick on sleep walk is the most efficient bc it makes the dragon full cast and they’re not doing dmg but I can still totem out of it. I dont take static vs dragons most of the time bc they can just fly right out of it. I’ve been going totemic a lot depending on comp bc their burst cleave open will flop someone on my team bc ppl don’t pop defensives. 

Mages- I feel like they’re pretty straight forward just pillar hug, dispel frost bomb and fire nova on allies and play poly/hex games the whole match. Not sure what’s best to kick I usually do ice lance but idk if something else is more value and I have no clue what’s good to kick for arcane. 

Warlocks/Spriest- I’ve been taking unleash shield against them over static and I feel like it’s getting good value but there’s no way to really tell. Other than UA and chaos bolt I’m not sure what’s good value to kick. For spriest I try to get mind flay but again maybe something else is better to kick. 

Hunters- Another class I feel super useless against. Maybe I’m bad but there seems to be no way to avoid getting ice trapped on cd. Any tips to counter this are super appreciated. Also pretty hard to hex bc of feign death and meld. 

DK’s- Usually go totemic to help counter the big cleave. Also take unleash shield sometimes too bc once they pop their AOE grip ability they’re hitting that one guy for the next few secs. I’m not sure if unleash shield will reduce the dmg of wounds/dots on targets or just direct dmg they deal inside of the whirlpool. Static seems useless against them bc they can just grip targets or wraith walk out. I try to get hexes on the dk bc their dmg is so high rn. 

Ret/WW/Enh- I do take CS totem a lot vs these comps. Static and roots also seems to be really effective. I just learned I can ground HOJ when the ret charges me. Usually pretty good hex targets.

Rdruid- spam purge the hots, play hex/clone games. I try to thunderstorm the bash/clone combo but obv if they’re good it doesn’t work. I usually end up spending my kicks and groundings on clones. Static seems to be pretty effective against rdruids too. 

Disc/Holy- can be hard to hex bc of fade, I just try to keep tremor rdy for the charge fear. Try to purge rapture but they have so many little nonsense buffs it’s hard to get. Priests spam purging my hots and earth shield feels pretty bad but no way around it I guess. Recently learned grounding won’t pickup ultimate pen if they cast it on an ally and I’ve noticed a lot of them target allies with it so I may start fading grounding dependent on comp. 

Pres- probably my least fav healer to fight bc of the burst they have. Seems impossible to prevent the burst open with cc because of shroud. Try to save kick for chrono and use totems for sleep walk. Any tips on beating them appreciated.

With how warp travel makes time go wonky why does GW discontinue some named characters?,Warhammer40k,1fpw4h2,2024-09-26 09:25:01,0,0.48,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1fpw4h2/with_how_warp_travel_makes_time_go_wonky_why_does/,Parkiller4727,Lore,"Like if someone from Dark Age of tech could accidentally travel to 40k era because of warp shananigans or an Ork warboss kills his past self to have two of his favorite guns, why couldn't say Ciaphus Cain have the odd random adventure in modern 40k where his ship accidentally took him to the future and then returned him to his own time on his way back?

They could keep it grim dark in the idea of individuals having so little control/impact that traveling back in time doesn't change anything significant or is the cause of something bad happening. Like say a Blood Angel accidentally goes back to the Horus Heresy and he tries to save Sanguinous only to end up distracting Sanguinous which gets him killed during his fight with Horus.

Could have some interesting stories with the Ordo Chronos Inquistion having to either mind wipe or hunting down time travellers wether accidentally or otherwise.

Gives GW an out to keep making named characters on tabletop saying that they are there due to accidental time travel. Just less prominant due to its rarity."
Alternate Fanmade Gun Manufacturers,Borderlands,1foq8lj,2024-09-24 19:14:29,17,0.72,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1foq8lj/alternate_fanmade_gun_manufacturers/,CompetitiveButton240,[BL3],"Replacing all 12 Manufacturers with my own Fanmade ones. Enjoy!

• Chronos 

Gimmick: Instant reload via magazines that utilize Eridian derived tech to ""rewind"" themselves back to full, and/or high fire rate via gun barrels that accelerate time of bullets just enough to increase their speed without rusting/destroying the bullet. 

They also create grenades that put targets they explode into temporary time stasis, turns enemies to dust by massively accelerating their time and decreases movement speed of enemies by slowing down their time. 

Some high end Chronos guns don't have Instant Reload and/or Accelerated Fire Rate, instead being able to fire bullets that can generate the same kind of effects Chronos grenades can do, but scaled down somewhat. 

While Chronos guns can have either Instant Reload or Accelerated Fire Rate, very rarely do their guns have both. This is because their gun magazines can only rewind themselves for so many times before they need to be recharged, and the accelerator time barrels quickly builds up heat for every bullet that goes through them, which can result in their user being stuck in a tricky situation where they can't reload/or their gun overheats. In addition, due to how badly they interact with the time technology used to make them, Chronos Guns do not make Elemental guns. 

Luckily, several Chronos Guns have an alt mode where regular mags can be inserted and used while a Chronos magazine is recharging and most of their guns with Accelerated Fire Rate only fire in Bursts to mitigate overheating. 

Design: Sleek and futuristic, with neon lights/indicators placed all over. White/Black color scheme. Magazines and/or barrels glow neon colors when firing. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Heavy Weapons 

• Imperial 

Gimmick: All guns have an alt mode can converts normal ammo into laser fire. Laser shots are usually, but not always, elemental. When in alt mode, shots become more accurate with a reduction to fire rate and power, and some Imperial guns have their alt modes be capable of tracking/homing into enemies.  

In normal mode, Imperial guns do not shoot elemental bullets, but have high fire rates and power at the cost of accuracy. High end Imperial guns can have their bullets do tricks in normal mode instead such as ricochet, wide fire, and curve. 

Design: When in normal mode, Imperial guns have a blocky look to them, and seemingly use muted colors. When in alt mode, blocky parts shift into spikes and muted colors glow and become brighter. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Assault Rifles, 

• Vulcan 

Gimmick: Guns can be charged to generate powerful shots at the cost of extra ammo. The more a Vulcan gun is charged up, the more ammo is converted at once. Charged shots either fire a single powerful shot or a burst of powerful bullets at once. High end Vulcan guns have and can fire charged elemental bullets. Legendary Vulcan guns are capable of Overcharging in order to fire an extraordinarily powerful bullet or be able to fire multiple powerful bullets for a period of time, before rendering the gun unusable for a period of time. 

Design: Futuristic steampunk, incorporating a bronze and/or brass color scheme and steam vents across all Vulcan guns. When charging, steam builds up until the user fires, which results in steam being released from steam vents. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Shotguns, Smgs, Assault Rifles, Heavy Weapons

• Sabertooth 

Gimmick: Weaponized power tools. Sabertooth guns are highly durable, weighty, and have great firing power, through they have terrible accuracy, fire rate, and recoil. Their durability and weight makes them suprisingly effective Melee weapons at close range and many of their guns are more effective when used at a closer range. 

High end Sabertooth guns have alt modes that take advantage of their trait as powerful Melee weapons: using kinetic energy from swinging them at enemies to power up shots, increase the power of further Melee attacks, even create new bullets in their magazines if enough kinetic energy is built up. 

Design: Rugged, with bright construction worker stripes and warning labels plastered on most Sabertooth guns. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Heavy Weapons 

• Fluxxx 

Gimmick: Guns fire bullets with time delay, and deals elemental damage after a few seconds. While Fluxxx guns have poor damage and fire rate, their elemental effects are devastating,especially if targets are hit with multiple bullets at once to increase the power of those elemental effects. Fluxxx guns have great handling, accuracy, and reload speed to make it easier to deal bursts of elemental damage to foes. 

High end Fluxxx guns have an alt mode that switches their current element to another one. However, while more powerful and accurate than normal Fluxxx guns, these kind of guns have lengthy mode switching times which makes it rather difficult, if impractical for the user to stack multiple effects at once in high speed gun combat. 

Design: Fluxxx guns have a curvy design with fins that glow when firing. Depending on the gun's element, fins will glow with colors the correspond to that element. The more high end Fluxxx guns have bigger and elaborate looking fins. 

Guns: Pistols, Smgs, Shotguns, Assault Rifles

• Razorback

Gimmick: Piercing shots. Razorback guns can fire bullets that go through multiple enemies with ease. High accuracy, power, and handling, but slow reload and fire rate. Most of their guns have hitscan and shots become more powerful the farther away targets are from the user's shooting position. 

High end Razorback guns can fire bullets that explode after piercing through multiple targets, dealing normal or elemental splash damage to nearby targets or have homing shots that home into multiple targets to pierce into, at the cost of more reload speed, and some handling. 

Design: Slim and lightweight, with sharp angles in places. Easy to carry and hold, hardlight sight attachments on all Razorback guns. Light color schemes with dark color streaks in places. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Sniper Rifles. 

• Samson

Gimmick: Samson guns steadily increases their fire power, accuracy, and handling the less bullets there are in their magazines. Some Samson guns have burst fire for alt modes for their Smgs and Assault Rifles. By default, Samson guns have poor firing power, accuracy, and handling but have good fire rate and reload speed which stays static as they ramp up. After reloading, Samson guns revert back to their default state and must be built up again. 

High end Samson guns can perform tricks with their bullets or have their bullets gain elemental properties once they hit a low enough bullet count in their magazines. 
The final bullet(s) may explode and deal normal/elemental splash damage, pierce through multiple targets, ricochet, or home into targets. 

Design: Samson guns use transparent colors that glow brighter the less bullets there are in their magazines, indicating their increase in firing power.They also have bullet counter attachments that helps keep track of bullets left. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Assault Rifles,  Shotguns

• Kerberos

Gimmick: Turret mode. Kerberos guns have alt modes that turn them into static manual turrets with greater fire power and fire rate at the cost of accuracy and reload or can generate smaller automatic turrets that are more accurate and have faster fire rate and can be placed anywhere but have reduced firepower and range. By default, Kerberos guns have respectable fire power and fire rates but have slow reload times and poor handling due to their massive magazines. 

High end Kerberos guns have their alt modes fire in different styles or fire (different ) elemental shots. They can transform into static manual turrets that fires homing/exploding/ricochet/split shots or generate automatic turrets that can walk/run towards enemies to fire on them. 

Design: Kerberos guns are clad in darker colors and generally look menacing with sharp edges. They are also heavier with iron or digital sight attachments to them. 

Gun Types: Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Heavy Weapons  

• Carnation

Gimmick: Extra alt modes and incredibly quick mode switches. Carnation guns will usually have 2 extra alt modes instead of 1 extra alt mode that some other guns may have. These alt modes allows for greater versatility in combat and have great handling, accuracy,  and reload speed, though this comes at the cost of firing power, fire rate,and magazine size. Carnation guns have digistucted parts/attachments that can deconstruct and reconstruct themselves into different parts/attachments, which is how they are able to have more alt modes than usual guns with alt modes. Alt modes allows for a Carnation gun to be able to fire in at least 3 different ways or use 3 different types of elemental shots. 

High end Carnation guns can have 3 extra alt modes, which is one more than a normal Carnation gun's 2 alt modes, which grants even more versatility at the expense of more magazine size and even some reduction of accuracy and handling, though reload speed is higher, and even their fire power, and fire rate are improved somewhat. 

Design: Ornate and rustic, parts of their design include digistucted attachments and/or parts that deconstruct and reconstruct into different attachments and/or parts when switching modes. Have vivid and striking colors as their main color scheme. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Heavy Weapons

• Predator

Gimmick: Guns steadily increase their fire rate the longer their triggers are held and are nearly silent when firing allowing for silent sniping and ambushes. Predator guns have decent magazine sizes and reload speed, deal decent damage to targets, and have high accuracy, fire rate, and handling by default, but their stopping power is lacking, and they do not produce any elemental guns. 

High end Predator guns have additonal built in stealth modules that makes it easier to perform stealth kills to targets, such as muffling sounds around the user to reduce sounds from them, cloaking their user with invisibility, creating noise/digiclone decoys, and generating smokescreens. These modules can only be used for a short period of time and must cool down for several minutes before being usable again. 

Design: Uses different shades of black,grey and darker colors as their colour scheme, with some shades being near invisible in certain varying light visibilities. Incorporates blade like parts, somewhere on their guns' bodies. Can sometimes have hologram sights attached to them. 

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Sniper Rifles 

• Hive

Gimmick: Attached/mounted drones. Hive guns have alt modes that turns an attachment on them into an automatic drone that can perform a variety of tasks independent of their user. These drones can attack enemies, gather ammo/loot for you, or even heal/boost your stats when active. After some time, drones either automatically return to be mounted on their gun and recharge or if they're destroyed, a new drone is slowly digistructed right onto the mount. Hive guns by default have great fire power, fire rate, and accuracy with decent magazine size and reload speed to go with it, but have poor recoil and handling due to their mounted drones. When drones are active, recoil and handling are greatly boosted at the cost of fire power, fire rate, and accuracy, though magazine size and reload speed are unaffected. 

High end Hive guns have mounted drones that when mounted, grant their gun elemental properties or allows for trick shots. When active, these drones have greater range and battery power, allowing them to perform tasks for a longer period of time before needing a recharge. This comes at the cost of the user not being able to access their elemental/tricks shots for a period of time. 

Design: Insect/Carapace-like body. Mounted drones look like insects of different kinds. Hive guns use emerald green or golden yellow with black stripes as their main color schemes

Gun Types: Pistols, Smgs, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles

• Mayhem 

Gimmick: Killstreak Ramp Up. Mayhem guns ""level up"" and increase their stats when the user successfully kills a number of enemies with them in a short period of time. Mayhem guns have so-so fire power, fire rate, reload speed, recoil, and accuracy, but suprisingly have good handling and magazine size. However, depending on the type of Mayhem gun, if the user kills a certain amount of enemies with them very quickly, all of their stats will be boosted by a good amount. These boosts will last for as long as the user continually and successfully kills enemies without stopping. If the user doesn't kill an enemy with those boosted Mayhem guns after some time, all gained boosts are reset and the gun reverts back to its default state.

High end Mayhem guns will have specific stats be greatly boosted after meeting a minimum kill count with them, but at the expense of other stats, or even have their shots gain elemental properties. Legendary Mayhem guns will only focus on boosting 1 or 2 gun stats by a massive amount at the cost of severely reducing every other stat to compensate. Regardless, all Mayhem guns of different rarities will have static handling and magazine size. 

Design: Chaotic, with streaks of paint on them. Mayhem gun bodies are transparent, in order to see their internals, which shift and glow when in a boosted state.

#	Rallus ""Do Everything"" PVE Build												
													
##	Build Info												
													
Been awhile since I've posted a build...  I've been playing since Open Beta and have a rather extensive account, so some of this might be quite expensive to use for new players, but I figured I'd share this once because right now, the Rallus might be broken in that the Experimental weapon functions while in Science Destroyer mode.  It's also an excellent ship for my playstyle since it has a Temporal Primary and Intel secondary that works with the combination of Exotic (which I love!), Energy weapon and Tanking abilities that I use to complete PUG's, Endeavours and every aspect of the game.    This build does use aspects of current Meta along with previous, and quite old Meta that still functions quite well, and is not intended to chase DPS or work in conjunction with teams.  It is however designed to work with LOTS of AOE and multi-target damage, avoiding any use of single-target damage skills/gear as much as possible.

##	Build Description												
													
This build uses the Rallus T6 Romulan Dyson Science Destroyer and weaponry setup to completely all the space Weapon type Endeavours when they pop up without changing gear to complete them.  I also prefer to use gear or traits that accomplish TWO things in one, and also focus on Multi-target damage instead of single-target damage due to the nature of PVE.  This build can also tank a great deal of things, including shield tank Borg content, something that does indeed work when using this defensive setup.  Cooldowns are reduced mostly passively, plus Photonic Officer since it also boosts Exotic damage with the trait.

###	Skill Tree Information												
													
This is an old Skill Tree I've been using for well, since the skill trees were revamped.  The focus is on maximizing Exotic damage with Energy weapon damage as secondary.  It also utilizes Readiness for all three types to reduce cooldowns in conjunction with Krenim BO's and Photonic Officer plus the Improved Photonic Officer trait.  Realistically, you can use almost any skill tree you want for this, excluding Engineering heavy trees.													


##	Concluding Remarks												
										
Feel free to comment, or use any aspects of this for your builds!  Try out other ships too and combinations too.

 Khronos can activate a temporal shield that absorbs damage and slows time for enemies within a radius of action (10 seconds, 30 second cooldown). 

2. *Time Warp*: 
Khronos can teleport up to 100 meters in an instant, leaving behind an illusion that draws enemy fire (20 second cooldown). 

3. *Chronological Acceleration*:
 Khronos increases his movement and firing speed for 15 seconds, as well as reducing the reload time of his weapons (40 second reload).

 *Weapons:*


 - Timebreaker Particle Cannon (high damage, moderate rate of fire)
 - Chrono-Barrage Rocket Launcher (area damage, low rate of fire)

 *Advantages:*
 - High mobility
 - Solid defense thanks to the chronological shield
 - Ability to control the pace of battle

 *Disadvantages:*
 - Vulnerability to melee attacks
 - Reliance on skill recharge

 *Recommended strategy:*
 - Use time warp to surprise enemies or escape dangerous situations. - Activate chrono-shield to protect yourself during intense assaults. - Speed up with chronological acceleration to chase enemies or take key positions. What do you think of Khronos? How would you play him?

"" which company was it created and what type of robot would it be? ""

The ""Khronos"" robot I designed would be classified as an ""Assault/Scouting"" robot due to its abilities and characteristics.


 _Company:_ 
Khronos was developed by ""NovaTech Industries"", a leading company in robotics innovation and technology. 

_Classification:_ Assault/Scouting 

_Combat Role:_ - Assault: Khronos can infiltrate enemy territory and eliminate key targets thanks to his time warp ability. 
- Scouting: His mobility and ability to teleport allow Khronos to reconnoiter the terrain and detect enemy threats. 

_Specialization:_ - Extreme mobility - Stealth and surprise capabilities - Active defense with chrono-shield 

_Standard Equipment:_ - ""Timebreaker"" particle cannon - ""Chrono-barrage"" rocket launcher - Advanced propulsion system - High-frequency communication equipment NovaTech Industries designed Khronos to operate in hostile environments and turn the tide of battle with his unique speed and abilities.

""How DPS or damage cause the weapons""

Excellent question! Considering Khronos' design and specialization as an assault/scout bot, its weapons are optimized to damage enemy bots with precision and speed.

 *Timebreaker Particle Cannon*
 - Damage per bullet: 8,000 - 12,000
 - Rate of fire: 6 bullets/second
 - Damage per second (DPS): 48,000 - 72,000

 *Chrono-Barrage Rocket Launcher*
 - Damage per rocket: 20,000 - 30,000
 - Rate of fire: 2 rockets/second
 - Damage per second (DPS): 40,000 - 60,000

 Compared to the health of robots and titans: -

 Robots: 240,000 - 400,000
 (Khronos can take out a robot in 4-6 seconds with the cannon or 4-8 seconds with rockets)

 - Titans: 500,000 - 1,000,00. 
(Khronos can take out a titan in 7-14 seconds with the cannon or 8-20 seconds with the rockets)

 Remember that these values are estimates and may vary depending on the combat situation and the strategies employed.  

""How many HP have?""

850.000

Time Farm: The Secret to Easy Crypto Riches?,makemoneyonlineng,1fhjoah,2024-09-15 14:37:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemoneyonlineng/comments/1fhjoah/time_farm_the_secret_to_easy_crypto_riches/,udemezueng,,"Time Farm is a recently launched Telegram bot that lets users earn SECONDS tokens hourly.

Backed by a blockchain company, the project has generated significant interest. However, the excessive rewards offered for referrals raise concerns about its sustainability.

The crypto landscape is currently flooded with similar Telegram-based mining bots, leaving many users overwhelmed and sceptical.

While the fear of missing out can be a powerful motivator, it’s essential to approach these opportunities with caution.

Let’s delve deeper into Time Farm and examine the factors contributing to both its hype and scepticism.

# What Is Time Farm?

Time Farm, as mentioned before, lets you collect crypto tokens every four hours.

Owned by Chrono.tech, a blockchain company, it’s similar to other mini-apps you might know.

Unlike clicker games, though, there’s no need to tap repeatedly. You simply claim your earnings every four hours or earn through referrals.

# Why Should I Invest in Time Farm?

Investing your money can be a daunting task. With countless options available, it’s natural to wonder where to allocate your hard-earned funds. Time Farm presents an intriguing proposition.

But is it the right choice for you? Let’s delve into the potential benefits of investing in this unique platform.

# 1. A Steady Stream of Income.

One of the primary reasons to consider Time Farm is the potential for consistent returns.

Unlike traditional investments that can fluctuate wildly based on market conditions,

Time Farm offers a more predictable income stream. By investing in projects that contribute to positive social and environmental impact, you’re not just making money; you’re also making a difference.

# 2. Diversify Your Portfolio.

A well-rounded investment portfolio is essential for managing risk. Time Farm provides an opportunity to diversify beyond stocks, bonds, and real estate.

It allows you to invest in a different asset class that often exhibits low correlation with traditional markets.

This means that even if other investments underperform, your Time Farm holdings could potentially offset those losses.

# 3. Long-Term Growth Potential.

While Time Farm offers the potential for steady income, it also has the potential for long-term growth.

As the platform expands and the impact of its projects becomes more evident, the value of your investment could increase.

This growth potential, coupled with the positive social and environmental benefits, makes Time Farm an attractive option for investors seeking both financial returns and a sense of purpose.

# Pros of Time Farm

Here is a summary of the upsides or good aspects of time farm mining;

* Backed by credible, well-known brands.
* A clear roadmap showing that the mined coins will actually be listed on exchanges and traded. A major relief for players.
* Rumours of huge funding though unconfirmed at this time.

# Cons of Time Farm

* An unrealistically high referral program casts doubt into how serious the project is. The reason is, that crypto tokens tend to have more value when there is less supply in circulation. But with the amount of tokens many users will earn from just referring, we may have some doubts.
* The poorly designed mini-app looks too basic to me which makes me doubt how serious the project is.
* Having to come back every 4 hours to claim. This makes the game unsuitable for most busy people. Imagine having to open telegram to claim tokens every 4 hours when you have serious business to do? For me, I think they should have gone with the 24-hour cycle.

# How do I get Started?

**Time Farm** lets you **mine tokens** just by checking in every 4 hours! No complex setup, just pure farming fun. ⛏️

While on the game, you’re expected to check in every 4 hours to claim your mined tokens to the main balance.

It’s very simple and understandable whether or not you’ve had some experience with other games.

**GET STARTED —** [**TimeFarm**](https://t.me/TimeFarmCryptoBot?start=1hxY6GK9kNRvu1Byw)

# How do I Earn a Time Farm ($SECONDS) Token?

# Participate In Tasks.

To earn more tokens on Time Farm, simply click on Tasks on your dashboard, and you will see a list of activities to complete to claim more coins.

Most of the tasks have to do with following the community on various social media handles, endeavouring to complete the activities and then, claiming the coins for each.

This is a very easy way to boost your balance without doing much, another more stressful way is by referring.

# 2. Join The Referral Program.

The referral program is interesting and at the same time suspicious. You earn 20% from all referrals’ earnings and also earn more from the people they refer.

So it’s a chain that spreads across 5 levels. If you are looking to boost your balance, then referring is a major route.

To claim your referral bonus to balance, click on Friends and tap on the Claim button, the bonus will be instantly transferred to your main balance.

Another way of earning more tokens is upgrading your clock. They recently introduced new clocks that can fetch users up to **x5** of their initial mining rate.

# 3. Upgrade your Clock and Answer Oracle of Questions.

To access the new features, click on **Upgrade** at the top then purchase any of the clocks.

The newly introduced features such as Staking and Oracle of Time let users earn extra points by staking their total points for a fixed period.

The Oracle of Time is a task that players are to complete daily to earn extra tokens.

They ask a crypto-related question daily and people who get it correctly will earn an extra 250,000 points. You can access the Oracle of Time in the Earn tab.

# Final Verdict

You’re likely eager to know if Time Farm is legitimate. Unfortunately, definitively confirming the legitimacy of such a new crypto project is challenging.

With limited development and advancements, it’s difficult to gauge its long-term prospects.

To help you make an informed decision, let’s weigh the pros and cons. While some in my community have enthusiastically compared Time Farm to Notcoin V2, it’s essential to consider both sides.

On the positive side, Time Farm boasts a connection to LaborX, a relatively established company.

This lends a degree of credibility to the project. LaborX’s success in the Telegram mini-app space suggests a level of expertise that could benefit Time Farm.

Seekers of the Storm Rant,riskofrain,1ffs99w,2024-09-13 07:22:03,2,0.51,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/1ffs99w/seekers_of_the_storm_rant/,Pufftarot,RoR2,"I tried to post this on Youtube Comments, and it was only partially allowed, wouldn't let me post parts of it. Then tried pastebin, apparently this is offensive? Anyway, I spent hours writing this by accident, please enjoy.

Even if everything in SotS was great, and not buggy or broken in anyway, let's see what it has to offer in comparison SotV.

SotV added 41 items. SotS adds 20.

SotV added 11 monsters. SotS adds 3.

SotV added 5 environments. SotS adds 5 as well.

SotV added 2 bosses. SotS adds 0.

SotV added 1 special boss. SotS also adds 1 (albeit with nowhere near the spectacle).

SotV added 3 new chest 'types' (Cradle, Potential, Category). SotS adds 0 (unless you include the Aurelionite Shards).

SotV added 2 elite variants (Mending, Voidtouched). SotS adds 2 as well (Gilded and Garbage (Twisted is terrible game design)).

SotV added a new game mode. SotS did not.

SotV added 9 music tracks. SotS did as well (unless you include song of life, in which case it's 10 but like :/ ).

This looks bad, right? Let's see what SotS did more of.

SotS adds 3 Survivors. SotV added 2.

SotS adds an Artifact. SotV did not.

SotS adds 16 skins. SotV added 2.

SotS adds 2 shrines. SotV added none.

So out of all this, SotV has more content in 5/13 categories, they are equal in 4/13 categories, and SotS has more content in 4/13 categories.

What is important to note though, is that in each category they tie in, it isn't actually 'equal'.

SotV has 2 'special' areas, while SotS has '1', giving SotS more actual new stages.

Both DLC have 2 elite types! But, they aren't the same.

SotV has Mending and Voidtouched. Mending is both good and bad, as it heals enemies but also the player when killed. Voidtouched only comes about when a Void Infestor touches the enemy, controlling them and fighting other enemies. Voidtouched gives the enemy one or two abilities, from the Void items.

This is fantastic, because instead of just adding MORE, it adds DIFFERENT. Mending being the only 'good' elite gives it tactical usage from the player, keeping them around or killing them depending on the fight. Voidtouched is either a choice, in regards to opening void cradles; or it's also an environmental hazard and a challenge, thanks to the void seeds and the need to kill enemies to get the loot (and sometimes the teleporter).

SotS has Gilded and Twisted. Gilded is... fine. It takes money, and you get it back when you kill them; it's annoying, but it's not cool or tactical or special in any way. They have loads of health, though that may not be intentional (and Overloading is a way better use of that concept). Twisted elites... SUCK! THEY SUCK! Loads of health, LOADS OF DAMAGE! Making any enemies you hit in their bubble ZAP YOU TO DEATH IN LIKE ONE HIT???? Not only is this a joke since they only spawn post Stage 5, meaning you're already likely to be clearing the entire stage without touching the keyboard (causing them to just kill you without you even knowing it happened), they hit through walls. THROUGH WALLS!!!!

Elite types are tricky, because balancing them is really tough. The reason SotV's elites work so well is because one is both good and bad, and the other is the challenge you fight to reach a reward, whether it be the Void Cradles or the Void Seed. SotS's elites on the other hand, either bloat the elite pool with no interesting challenge (Gilded: they eat time and money, and soak up damage like a sponge making it boring as hell to have them in the game) or just downright terrible game design (Twisted. The fact this got through even the ideas phase is incredible).

Both DLC have 9 music tracks (technically SotS has more, but like, come on guys).

Both soundtracks are fantastic! I love both so much! I think SotV is my favourite, but SotS has more heavy stuff, which is nice. I love Face of the Deep, They Might As Well Be Dead, Once in a Lullaby, and Who Can Fathom The Soundless Depths! They're so varied and crazy, with amazing twists and turns in them.

SotS has some absolute bangers as well! I love how insane the tempos and time signatures get, the switchups and twists are great! My favourite has to be Oṃ Maṇi Padme Hūṃ, part II (yes I copy pasted it) the jazz piano is an amazing twist on the RoR2 style. Yane no Mori is another favourite, I love how soulful it feels! The chill vibes and the amazing guitar solo near the end give it such a great feeling. But I do feel like SotS may overuse the guitar? Might have to sit on it more, as I haven't listened to this soundtrack as much, but I do find myself more recognising the style of the soundtrack, rather than each individual song like in SotV.

The last category they are equal in is environments.

Honestly, I like both sets. They add great variety to the game, and a new stage 5 was GREATLY NEEDED!

But, I do have qualms. SotV has Siphoned Forest, Aphelion Sanctuary and Sulfur Pools. The variety is high, with fantastic new (and wildly different) tracks for the stages.

SotS has The Shattered Abodes, Reformed Altar, Treeborn Colony and Helminth Hatchery. These... could have been better. I love them, don't get me wrong. I like the music, and I like the variety. But they still have the same sort of vibe? I love the verticality of Helminth, but it reeeeaaaallly feels like Abyssal again. The hell aesthetic is nice, but like... the red is just there again. Going from Abyssal to Helminth gives the sort of ""ow, my eyes"" feeling more than anything else. And the other 3 stages have the same vibe. Grassy ruins overgrown with life, similar music tracks (they each have their own flair (and are fantastic)), and they have frustrating enemy choices. Especially since there are only 3 new enemies! The Scorch Wurms are actually the worst enemy in the game, digging underground constantly where you can't hit them, having fire areas with hitboxes WAY bigger than the visible orb, and massive health bars. Childs teleport around, ignoring freeze and stun stuff for the first couple tries (They're only on abodes though), and Halcyonite (while cool) reuses Voidlings code for the laser and just is repetitive and bland in my opinion (also he spawns rarely other than the shrines, meaning the variety is, again, low). The new stages lack enemy variety, adding four new areas with 3 new enemies; 1 of which feel awful to fight and one that barely spawns.

The director has loads of credits on these stages it seems, giving soooo much loot every time I go. This is fine, and is kind of nice, but still a bit op.

But the worst, THE WORST PART OF THESE NEW ENVIRONMENTS IS: The Path of the Colossus.

Do you want the new survivor skins? You do? Play the same four stages, every run. WHATTTTT????? This, other than completely diverting the need for Dreaming for other environments (since the new ones have so much loot), you add the Halcyon Shrine which adds LOADS OF LOOT to stage 1 every time. Every time you ask? Yeah. It's real common stage 1, and if you don't see ""You Hear Thunder Rumbling"" in the chat, you restart. So that detracts from the difficulty a lot, but what else?

So, every run aimed at the False Son is as follows: Fight Shrine, Go to Reformed Altar. Go to Treeborn Colony. Go to Prime Meridian. Go to Helminth Hatchery. Go to Mithrix. This is on Eclipse.

If you don't play Eclipse, it's even worse. Shrine, Altar, Colony, Meridian, done. Game is over! Well played!

This is just spitting in the face of RoR2's gameplay loop, in my opinion. The randomness and macro decisions of dreaming? Gone. Stage Fours that I love so much (minus Siren's)? Gone. The tough and grueling runs with difficult decisions? Gone. Obviously not completely, and I'm very opinionated on this, but the Path of the Colossus as a concept, in my opinion, sucks. Even though I like the stages, music, and the \*\*idea\*\* of fighting another boss on the way to Mithrix; this new 'path' is just not going to stand the test of time. Get the new skins, now what? There is no reason to go back!

Now, that's the equal stuff out of the way. What does SotS add more of? Let's take a gander.

SotS adds 3 Survivors, whereas SotV added 2.

I find Seeker really fun (if a bit op), False Son is pretty fun in my opinion, and Chef sucks.

SotV added Railgunner and Void Fiend, which are a bit different. So Railgunner is a sniper, and Void Fiend changes forms, which are both pretty cool ideas. Void Fiend's meter changing with healing is a neat new way to change the way you play. Railgunner's range also differentiates her from the rest of the cast.

Seeker's teamwork capabilities are really cool! The revive is nice to have (multiplayer is a bit nicer now, instead of friends having to wait until the next stage to be revived), and both Secondary abilities are fun and have their uses. The Utility is... op. Trade health for damage? Infinite usability? Maybe not the best idea! And Meditate is pretty eh. I personally find the quick time events kind of fun, having to find a safe place to slam some keys and heal up is nice, and saving the seventh use for the revive and elixir buff is fun strategy wise. I like Seeker's AoE capabilities and her 'team player' attitude.

Chef is balls. Ass cheeks. Doo doo. The Primary is annoying, not being able to throw out many cleavers at once, and having to manually return the cleaver. It's nice it does damage while fully extended, but you can't do much while it's out so that use is pretty useless as it turns out. The Secondary SUCKS. It's fun that you can roll around with it, but the fact you can only do that if you start the Fire after using the Utility to roll around makes me think it's a bug. Also, there's so much downtime after use! You use the fire, and then once the fire goes out you have to wait for a few seconds to do anything else; it feels awful. His utility feels bad, charging it is a waste of time since it absolutely does NOT make up for the time spent charging it, and it's sooooo BORING! It's just Mul-T's without the big hit of damage, or the armour! Sure, you can ram through a bunch of enemies, but why? Using it is slow, bland, and feels bad. His Special though... wow, what a fun ability! I haven't unlocked the alternate one yet, but the 'Glaze' ability is cool! It shoots a shotgun blast of massive bombs of oil, for massive damage and they go really far for some reason! Sure, it's op, and doesn't fit with his kit at ALL, but it's fun!

Now, Chef's main gimmick is 'cooking' the enemies. You burn them, glaze them, cut 'em, then kill them and you get a Monster Tooth-esque health drop. Cool! If Chef was fun normally, then this would add to the kit. But again, healing is not that necessary unless you're in Eclipse. It's only useful in a kit if you \*\*spend\*\* that health on things like attacks or something. Rex does that really well, and Void Fiend tries his best! But Chef fails, since you have to use ALL YOUR (damage) ABILITIES (maybe not Glaze? But if that's the case you don't use the best ability so what a downer!) on the enemies for it to work, and those abilities aren't fun or interesting UNLESS tied to the food gimmick! The only thing that's cool about this stuff, is the fire ability with glaze, but even then YOU HAVE TO USE THE FIRE ABILITY!!! I don't like Chef.

False Son is... kind of cool actually! He's not \*\*finished\*\*, but his stuff is interesting at least. The real game changer of False Son is 'Growth'. The more max health you have, the more abilities you have. The more secondary abilities you have, the more you use his buffs! If you have his spikes, you get attack speed and armour! And if you've spent them, you get move speed and regen! This is REALLY COOL! It gives bison steak and infusion a use, making False Son slip right into the rest of the cast. He gets more time on his Special ability laser thingo the more max health you have, and more charges of his alternate special with it. It's really, really cool! He has a dash. And his m1 is a smack, but if you hold right click and release you do a BIG smack. More abilities? More game!

Now, this SOUNDS great.... and it is, as an idea. But it's not that good in action, due to a few reasons.

One: his Spikes aren't agile. You have to \*\*use\*\* them to gain the move speed and regen, but they stop your sprint! It feels SO GROSS. It actually makes me motion sick, so I don't play him much. Also, they fire super slowly. The whole point of the spikes in use, is that they give you a damage boost against the enemy they're stuck in. But aiming them feels awful, and they slow you down, and they are slow to shoot. And when you have like 10 of them thanks to Growth, it's a chore to use them, so I just don't. The laser, is also not agile. Which, in concept, is sorta fine. What isn't, is that it ALSO SLOWS DOWN YOUR MOVEMENT SPEED WHEN WALKING? It feels god-awful! I can't believe this happened, False Son's ideas are so good! And the laser fires FROM HIS FACE, NOT AT THE CROSSHAIR! SO IT MOVES WITH HIS ANIMATIONS! WHY???????

To fix this, I have a few ideas. The spikes should be agile, and either fire faster or be hitscan. As a price for this, they should do NO DAMAGE. They give a damage boost already when they hit something, and their use is for the buffs you have when you either have them or don't. They should be \*\*entirely\*\* used as a strategic tool, not as a weapon.

The other thing is to make his laser either agile, or not slow walking speed. He's a melee character, don't fuckin' slow him down like this. I like flamethrower more in practice, honestly. As a price for this, lower the damage or something. Or even just make the charge agile, then have it make him walk when he lasers it up. It feels terrible as it is.

Other than that, I like False Son. He makes items that I hated somewhat useful, and is an asset to the survivor roster.

The survivors are cool! But the last thing I want to touch on here, are unlockables.

Each survivor (minus Void Fiend because he has two sets of abilities in game) has 3 unlockable abilities. All of them.

Except for Seeker, False Son, and Chef. Not only this, but they don't even get a skin for beating the False Son (the boss)! What a waste! Don't just 'not' add skins for the new guys! Or just 'not' add abilities! DLC Survivors, as shown by SotV, should not have 'less'. Void Fiend has four alternate abilities (technically, but even then I'm still annoyed he doesn't have unlockable ones, it just means I play him less). But really? Not adding a third skin to the new guys? They just stick out like a sore thumb! Less abilities, less skins... less fun. Just fuckin' give the new guys the content we expect from a survivor, no half assing. And Chef's skin is atrocious, just thought I'd throw that out there.

While I'm talking about this, I'll just mention the SKINS. The ones I've unlocked are kinda cool! Not great, but kinda cool. Actually really weird in some cases. Rex's is boring in my opinion (might change, we'll see), I was expecting... not another flower. Merc's is so... weird. Really weird. I kind of like it? Not too chuffed about it though. Railgunner's is kinda cool, but not as cool as her other skin. Artificer's is cool but I like the mage one better. The running theme seems to be 'fantasy', which I can appreciate. Having these kind of out there skins is nice, but again they aren't actually that varied. They're either exactly what I would have expected (in a bad, predictable and bland way), or REALLY WEIRD making me have no idea what to think. That's all I have for thoughts on the skins.

SotS has an artifact added, where SotV had none.

It sucks! Gives you either the item you donate after False Son from your previous run, or just a single random item. It sucks.

We have shrines! SotV added none.

SotS adds two, the first being the Shrine of Shaping. Takes 30% health, gives an extra life for the stage, and revives other players when hit. It's cool, I guess? It's nice having the extra life, and makes watches more likely to break. But, it's overpowered. In my opinion, this shrine would work best if it appeared ONLY in multiplayer, and ONLY revived other players, and didn't give an extra life to the living players. Much more strategic, much more fun than just hitting it every time as a no brainer.

The Halcyon shrine is weird, let's get into the details

It spawns a bubble (you've got to be kidding me) where you charge it slowly with money. Once you've charged it a quarter of the way, you can hit the shrine again to spawn the Gold Guy to kill, then you get one item (out of a pool of three). If you don't do that, you charge it more, and past (I think) 75% you get two items (out of a pool of four). Charge it fully, and you get three (out of a pool of five).

This is cool, but AGAIN, it adds so many more items to a run, and guarantees a choice from the player. While it is nice to have that choice, it feels REALLY strong. Five chances at good items? Taking three of them? It's busted. But that's not the only thing it does, it spawns a Grordal, and you have access to The Path of the Colossus. I've already voiced my opinions on this path, but again, I don't like it. I think it sucks, is boring, is bland, and is a waste of space in the game. It also means I'm very likely to take it, even when I'm not going to False Son. It's a free way to get to a decent stage 2 and 3. This 'choice' could be fixed by making Wetland better, and Rallypoint not god-awful, but as it stands there's no reason not to take the Grordal other than bands on Aqueduct or for variety's sake. Also, beating False Son skips Stage 4, meaning no chance of Sirens, which is also a no brainer instead of trying in the Bortal to dream for not Sirens, which gives you like one or two other choices. I understand fighting False Son can be a pain, and Prime Meridian sucks balls, but it's way better than Siren's Call.

Overall, the Halcyon shrine (while an okay idea) feels broken in concept and just means I'm spending WAY MORE TIME sitting in FUCKING BUBBLES charging PILLARS EVERY DAMN RUN. Not only this, but the rewards you get from it are SO GOOD THAT IT'S STUPID NOT TO DO IT. Stage 1 I charge Halcyon and Teleporter. Then two more teleporters on my way to False Son (unless another Halcyon spawns, in which case I charge that pillar too), and then stand behind pillars in False Son's fight, or in circles next to pillars while you fight him. Then, charge a teleporter on the way to Mithrix (and a Halcyon Pillar if it spawns), and then now that Host skip has been 'patched', I do FOUR MORE FUCKING PILLARS, I fight Mithrix, then I CHARGE THE SHIP AS WELL!!! THIS SUCKS SO MUCH! STOP ADDING MORE FUCKING PILLARSS TO THE GAME I'M GOING TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK!!!!

I guess now I talk about the categories SotV has more content in? God, this is so long already. Items, here we go.

So, SotV has 41 items, and SotS has 19. Less than half. What a joke.

Not only this, but two of SotS's items are Elite Aspects (which on the DLC's release broke the game, but we're disregarding bugs here for the most part), one's a Dio's equipment, and SO MANY require getting hit to use.

Antler Shield? Get hit.

Warped Echo? Get hit, lose Safer Spaces defence and take damage anyway.

Bolstering Lantern? Get hit, lose watches (which are better since you don't need to lose health, so scrapping Bolstering Lantern is usually a good move).

Noxious Thorn? Get hit.

Unstable Transmitter? Get hit, get confused, die.

Then, we have the items that suck balls and are scrap.

Knockback Fin? Moves enemies in the air. Great! Now they aren't where I was aiming at!

Prayer Beads? Charge them with XP? When you lose them you gain 'stats'. Not only is there \*\*no way\*\* to know how much 'stats' you gained, there is no animation, sound, ANYTHING when you 'lose' the beads, which is when you get it! It's literally MADE TO BE SCRAP! It's a cool idea, but it feels stupid and has no reinforcement on when it works, how it works, and what it helps with. It sucks, scrap it. Well, for Prayer Beads, it could have had a cool Void Counterpart. Like there's a Void Beads that gives a small boost to something while you have it, so you stack Prayer Bead levels and turn it into a void later on. Just an idea.

War Bonds? Actually scrap. ""Oh cool, I can buy a chest!"" Yeah, me too. I spent thirty seconds playing the game.

Chronic Expansion is overpowered, it should be like Berzerker's Pauldron but giving a single damage boost when you've killed 5 enemies in quick succession or something as an un-improveable buff (the buff shouldn't stack), then upping that damage with each stack. Kill a few enemies, get 5% extra damage (+5% per stack) until out of combat. Easy fix.

Right now, it's a garbage item, unless you have a good FMP build in which case it's the best and most overpowered item in the game. Terrible balancing here.

And now we have the BIG KAHUNA. The item that fucks up the entire game by being an infinite item glitch.

Sonorous Whispers has a chance on Elite kill to drop an item. Large Enemies (I think it's bosses, whether worldspawn or teleporter) ALWAYS drop an item. Sometimes enemies drop more than one! Why? Because game balance was out the window when they were still on the drawing board!

I think the fact that 56 Leaf Clover wasn't \*\*in\*\* RoR2 already, and was referenced in the 57 Leaf Clover is reason enough to believe Hopoo already THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. They made the conscious decision not to have this item in the game because it's A REALLY BAD IDEA. RoR2 is not vampire survivors! It was really well balanced, the mechanics tweaked to perfection! Everything in the game worked to make it fun, satisfying, and challenging! Except for looping!

I feel ACTUALLY BAD when I find this item. Like, it ruins the game for me. Infinite items IS NOT FUN. And you can say 'oh just don't take it', or 'just blacklist it' but it's more that I am just completely opposed to this sort of stuff being in the game. Also, 'just don't take it' is fine for common items like Void Crit, but a legendary? That's a big fish to toss out, especially if it's from the legendary chest, or a large chest, or an adaptive; because you're not just 'skipping' the item, you're actively losing out on the other items you could have gotten! And even if you DO skip it, that doesn't change the fact it's IN THE GAME, and THE SINGLE BEST ITEM TO PICK UP. It is actually, factually, the best item in the game, and there is no contest. And fucking SAFER SPACES IS IN THE GAME!

I was going to bring this up when we talk about SotV's items, but Safer Spaces is overpowered. It blocks a hit of damage, recharges fast, is a common item, and stacks well. This could be fixed by making it a red item.

Sonorous Whispers can't be fixed by doing that. Even as a LUNAR I'd argue it'd be way too broken. They lowered the chance of an item dropping from 15% + 5% per stack, to 4% + 1% per stack. But I'd argue that even 1% per stack is overpowered! If it started at 1%, that's still broken! You get guaranteed item drops from 'big' enemies! The \*\*ONLY\*\* way I could see this staying in the game, while not being completely fucking busted, is if you couldn't get items from big enemies. 1% chance or less on Elite kill, and like, + .1% per stack. That's it. Even getting two items from this conch is stupid.

The director was made so that everything costs a PRICE. It balances item drops, by making only a certain amount spawn. Sure, big chests and category chests can give good items, but that credit COST is taken from the pool of the stage.

The Conch sucks, I hate it, I want it gone. Because if it stays, then I can't trust Gearbox to look after the game, I just can't. And this is WITHOUT the bugs, without breaking the entire game, without patching bugs that are fun and cool like Mercenary's booping, Rex's AWU kill, and Host Skipping.

Anyway, moving on from that... mistake of an item, we have some really cool additions in SotS!

Sale Star is so cool! Having the added thought and strategy from using it is really fun, and I like hunting for the best chest on the stage or planning with lockboxes. Since it doesn't work on the Void lockbox, rusted key can actually be better sometimes! I think it working on the Legendary chest is a bit... interesting. I'm not completely opposed to it, but maybe it should be a 50% chance to work or something. Other than that, I absolutely adore this item.

Chance Doll IS MY FAVOURITE THING EVER! I love it so much, Chance Shrines are my gambling fix in RoR2 and now I'm rewarded even further! The absolute JOY of leaving a shrine 'til last, then finding a Gambling Man when you kill the boss, and using the shrine after teleporter to get a Red item is EUPHORIC! And the other day, I had the Gambling Man and I used a Chance Shrine, and I got a FUCKING BOSS ITEM!!! IT UPGRADES LEGENDARY ITEMS INTO BOSS ITEMS! IT'S SO FUCKING COOOOOOOL!

I love this item, the Gambling Man is my favourite item in the game now, bar none.

Luminous Shot is interesting! Getting more damage on your Primary after using your Secondary is interesting, it's the first item like this. I'm not sure what I think about it, but the more I use it the more I like it. It's better on some survivors than others, and it makes me think about my kit. Good item!

Growth Nectar.... should be a Void Item. I'm sure many others have echoed this, but having this and Death Mark in the same build is CRIMINAL. Having it as a Void Death Mark is a great way to make it work better balance wise, and be a more fun choice. Playing Seeker and have a few buffs in your build? Growth Nectar! Playing Rex with bleed and Runald's band? Death Mark! It's such a great idea, and would work perfectly I have no idea why it wasn't added. Probably to not 'step on the toes' of SotV as Gearbox put it, but we'll keep that thought in the back of our mind until later where I'll expand on it.

As it is, the item is fun, if not overpowered. Really overpowered, honestly. But it's a red, and it's fun. Should be a void though.

Electric Boomerang! A fun little proc item that activates often for a bit of extra damage and a longer proc chain. I really like this thing, the zappy animation and the zappy sound are like music to my ears, and it feels like a lot of fun to play with. I really like this one!

And last but not least, Runic Lens. I like this item... buuuuut...

IT'S SO CONFUSING! I have no idea how it stacks, and I've read the description like fifty times! Now, I'm sure that says more about me than the item, but you know what I'm getting at.

Runic Lens is fun, but the animation (being a circle on the ground telling you where the meteor will hit) looks really stupid in the air, and when I use it I kind of forget I have it. It honestly feels like more like a damage item than a proc item, feeling pretty flat to have. I like the idea of the item, more than anything. I don't like this item for the same reason I like Electric Boomerang: it just doesn't feel good.

But hanging onto that idea of feeling flat, that's a running theme for every item in SotS. So many defense items that feel flat and bland to have, Knockback Fin feels flat in that the only time I notice it is when the enemy I was attacking is no longer where I was attacking it, taking me out of the zone.

Lantern only works at low health, and while teetering between Watch and Lantern levels of health is an interesting idea, there are no items or equipment to help with that at all! The only character I like it on is Rex, as he's the only one worth picking Lantern up on, honestly. Other than that, it just feels flat again. Trash it!

Chronic feels flat in that I barely notice it until a single burst of damage when a bunch of stuff spawns (thanks only to the busted director), then it just disappears again. Feels heavy in my inventory, like a paperweight!

Same could be said for Prayer Beads. The animation on 'item level up' is interesting, but the item only works when you trash it. And when you do trash it, there's no visual indicator of what happened, just a silent change on the virtual abacus for you to forget about.

Unstable Transmitter fucks my brain up real hard. I either get motion sick and win, or get confused and die. Similar to False Son's spikes!

Thorn is cool on Rex, but I feel bad from getting hit already on everyone else, and I'm not going to build a tank / retaliation build because that just DOESN'T WORK in RoR2 most of the time (It works on Drizzle and Rainstorm, and it works with specific builds on Monsoon and Eclipse (mostly thanks to the new update's Jank)).

War Bonds sucks balls, and Seed of Life is another extra life, without the added interest of Void Dio's corruption. Yeah, you get a healing equipment. Great.

Most of the items feel flat. The fact I only had good things to say about 6 items out of the \*checks notes\* NINETEEN items they added (I didn't talk about the aspects because they don't affect normal gameplay) shows how bland and flat the entire DLC is. I still can't believe how little content it added, UUGGGHHHGHGHHG

Almost forgot about the Lunar item. Getting items when you level up instead of getting money is interesting, it doesn't feel to good though. I feel weak while I use it, but I don't like Lunars anyways so I would have ignored it either way. Cool concept though.

So, SotV items. 41 of them (I think 42 now? Does Void Aspect count towards SotV or SotS?!), and they've got a lot going for them!

Obviously, the first thing to talk about is the new item type added in SotV, the Void Items! A great new addition that adds variety and decision making to RoR2 without bloating the loot pool (take notes SotS!). Not only that, but unlike SotS, SotV added new chest types. Void Cradle takes half your health, spawns Void Infestors that are hard to track and make enemies SIGNIFICANTLY more dangerous, and gives an item that will significantly change your run without being too overpowered (in concept!). It does this by corrupting the Non-Void counterparts of the Void Items, meaning they can't be used as their original version or scrapped anymore.

The Void Potentials take half your health and give you a choice between 3 items. Like a multishop, but it steals your organs.

And it also added category chests, meaning you get whatever 'type' of item is on the chest. Damage, Utility, or Health.

These new chest times and items greatly helped to keep item pool bloat in check. Not only that, the Executive Card was added. And now that there were 5 new white items in the pool, alongside 5 common Void Items (notice how they added the same amount of both? Almost like it was planned...), having access to more of the white items was easier than ever, making it harder to notice that you were getting less of the original set of items.

I'm just going to list the good (and fun!) items in SotV, as there's way more of them and I don't want to summarise everything!

Watch, Elixir, Pennies, Opal, Wungus, Spaces and Larva changed how we think about health and our interactions with it by having us lose items by taking damage, and change items by dying.

Pennies (now that Watches and Elixirs were added) made it worth risking losing items in exchange for money!

Opal and Spaces gave one-hit-armour and a one-hit-shield respectively, taught players to dodge more effectively and treat their full health bar with respect!

Wungus healing on sprint gave a (admittedly not very good) 'decision' between bungus and wungus (that is only difficult to make on Engineer if you have stationary turrets!). Healing on sprint is fun though, and even though it's overpowered it feels good to play with.

Regen Scrap, Shorm, Void Key, Card, and Tricorn all fuck with the status quo of getting items.

Regen Scrap (if printers or soups are available) can snowball into way more items by the moon.

Card gives you WAY more items, accessing the (now slightly larger) item pool to greater effect, and since you can use it on Shorm, that item needs thought put into its use as well; more than just 'which item' (because now it can be both!).

Void Key is a great item. It would be a hard decision to take instead of Rusted, but since Void Items are (mostly) way better than normal items, and the Void Key lets you pick between three, it's an easy take.

And Tricorn gives you an instant boss kill and a boss item. What's not to love?

These items all help with making Macroing more interesting! Fight the boss? Oh, there're chance shrines and an equipment multishop with two Tricorns in it! ""Let's check the shrine for card, and see if we can get them both!"". ""I'll wait to open the Void Box, there might be another Rusted Key on the stage to turn into a Void Key for next stage!"".

These are the things I love having to think about in this game!

Ignition Tank, Laser Scope, I.C.B.M., and Drone Parts are great because they aren't good on their own. They force you to think about your build, what items you have and what's on the horizon, and make decisions of which the ripples will be felt until Mithrix.

They're also great on different survivors. Tank is good on Artificer (I don't care, I like flamethrower), Scope is great on Bandit and Railgunner (and Huntress with Flurry if you have the crit!), I.C.B.M. is fantastic on Engineer, and Drone Parts is too (I can't remember if the turrets get drone parts, but either way Drone Parts is for sure good on Engi so take that!).

And (even though it's kind of ass) Molotov was added too, meaning Ignition Tank now has an equipment to work with as well.

Shurikens give characters who can't proc bands a way to, fixing a power imbalance that was present prior.

Polylute and Needletick are both fantastic proc items! While Polylute is a no brainer against Ukelele since you can't use Uke on Mithrix (and Plute is just strong out the whazoo), but Needletick is a great sidegrade to Tri-Tips. Can't stack bleed right now? Might be worth taking Needletick.

Tentabauble and Scorpion are both powerful debuffs. Scorpion is better on characters with high fire-rate, and Tenta is a Void, so you gotta pick between it and Chrono. Want the enemies to be slow all the time, or locked in place some of the time? Not as easy a decision as you think.

Plasma Shrimp is just more damage, and I.C.B.M. buffs it to kingdom come, so that's a great synergy. But you lose ATG which can give huge damage boosts, so that's something to think about (Althought when you pick up Plimp you get an extra stack, so that loss is often mostly mitigated).

Zoea and Ducleus both give new minions (Duke sucks though), and Zoea eats all your boss items meaning it's a high price to pay sometimes. Although you can only get it from gunning a void-crab, or when you die with Larva and have boss items, so it's really never gonna be gained on purpose (bar Larva on Engi).

And Goobo Jr. gives you a clone to fight alongside! That's a friendly little fella that's fun to have.

Remote Caffeinator can heal all these fellas too! Great for multiplayer and for when you've got a bunch of big muscular boyfriends you want to give an energy boost.

Lysate gives more Special abilities, losing you your Fuel Cells. This can be a huge decision, and is a great sidegrade.

Mocha gives half a speed item and half an attack item's worth of stats (I know this barely fits here but I couldn't think of where else to put it), and having another speed item in the loot pool is HUGE!

Voidsent is Wisp on hit instead of on kill, less powerful but still fantastic, a good sidegrade (even though getting an extra stack of Voidsent on pickup means it'll be about the same as Wisp).

Bottled Chaos buffs all equipment pretty much. It good.

Onto the ass items from SotV, we have a few.

Braincoat sucks, it was overpowered on launch but got nerfed to all hell, I barely notice I have it nowadays.

Hunter's Harpoon is godawful. Kill a chimera on MIthrix Phase 3? Run into the pizza! Also motion sickness.

It really should have just been Infusion but for speed. Doesn't do anything when you get it, but when you kill like 100 guys you get 1.5 items worth of speed. Maybe infusion tech would work on it, and if you find a bunch or a printer you could Macro it a bit.

The Lunars are terrible. Pauldrons just suck, one nerfs movements speed for health, and the other is attack speed for health. And if I got that wrong, I don't care! I'll never use them anyway!

Egocentrism eats an item a minute and gives you another Ego in return. It spawns little bombs (depending on how many egos you have), and it's never worth it. Funny though.

Eulogy Zero makes Lunars spawn sometimes in normal chests and shops. Even printers are affected, and soups may be too? And I \*\*think\*\* if the Artifact of Evolution is on and you have Eulogy then monsters can spawn with Lunar items. Not super sure about that one, but thought I'd cover the bases.

His Reassurance is pretty useless in single player unless you're Engi (he's such a special sausage), in multiplayer it can be good. Pretty boring for an aspect though, but it's literally just the Elite's powers in an passive equipment so I'm glad it can still drop anyways.

Singularity Band eats Kjaro and Runald's bands, so it must be strong as hell, right?

Weeeelll, it's okay. Like, it's fine, but because it eats the Fire and Ice bands it's easily one of the worst items in the game, if not THE worst item in the game (pre-SotS).

Then we have the omega OP ones. Benthic and Lenses.

Benthic upgrades items every stage, and Lenses has a chance to instakill non boss enemies. I never take either (unless playing with friends and doing dumb stuff) since they just make the game either too easy (in Lenses' case) or ruin the decision making part of RoR2 (Benthic).

And there we have it! 29 Good and/or fun items, 10 Bad or Underwhelming Items, and 2 game breakingly unfun overpowered items.

For reference, SotS has 6 Good and/or fun items, 9 Bad or Underwhelming Items, and 1 game breakingly unfun overpowered items.

Can you see the issue here? The good and fun item count has gone down by TWENTY-THREE, while the bad category went down by ONE, and the game breaking count went down by ONE.

Keep this little nugget in mind.

Jesus, we're on monsters now. SotV has 11, SotS has 3.

SotS adds Child, Scorch Wurm, and Halcyonite. Child is annoying and teleports around, dealing big chunks of damage with a small hitbox. Similar to Hermit Crabs, in different ways. Small and hard to hit from afar, hidden out of sight, insta-kill levels of damage.

Their design and animations are cute.

Scorch Wurm (as I've mentioned earlier) is awful, digging underground where he's INVINCIBLE, spits out fire areas that if you are in you take fire damage (the hitbox is significantly bigger than the visible area), and having a massive healthbar for it's size. It's not fun to fight, it makes the same shaking that Elder Lemurians do which confuses me, and its attacks are unfair. This is my least favourite enemy in the game, bar none.

Their design is really bland, and animations are exactly what you'd expect from this type of enemy (that isn't fun in any game it's in, just a reminder\~)

And Halcyonite. He's fine. Spinny guy with sword, reuses Voidling's laser code, must have costed a nickel to make. He's a very underwhelming fight when I do the Halcyon shrines, wish he had... more.

Baby's first golem design, baby's first animations, baby's first sfx.
