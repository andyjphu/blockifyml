currently I am in discussion with someone from the Cardano-community who told me that I have to delegate my voting-power to a DRep in order to be able to withdraw my staking-rewards. Since I have my ADA on a ledger, I cannot really do this directly but I have to use the cardano - gov - web  -app  - page and there to type in my seed-phrase.

I cannot believe that this is the only way. I will not type in my seed-phrase there since it would be my seed-phrase for my ledger which secures also other assets.

I don't really want to move my ADA anywhere else. What can I do instead or can I withdraw my staking-rewards anyway? I couldn't really find and clarifying ressources out there.

Thank you for clarification!"

Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that empowers its community to help shape its future through active participation. At the heart of our governance model are DReps. Any ada holder can register as a DRep or delegate their stake to DReps who align with their values.

In a move that surprised many, Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind $ADA's Cardano blockchain, opted out of the swanky World Economic Forum in Davos to attend the World of Concrete expo in Las Vegas. Why mingle with the elites when you can roll up your sleeves and learn about cutting-edge concrete tech? For Hoskinson, it's about staying grounded—literally.  

He shared how his interests go far beyond the crypto world. From ranching bison to running a regenerative medicine company, and even managing a contracting business, this guy wears a lot of hats. While his Cardano team held the fort in Davos, he chose concrete innovation, showing his hands-on approach to tech and progress.  

Hoskinson explained that Cardano has grown into a decentralized behemoth, allowing its community to choose its own path. He took the time to highlight some major updates coming to $ADA, including the Plomin hard fork and a whole new governance layer called DReps. These upgrades aim to make Cardano more inclusive, scalable, and forward-thinking than ever.  

And while hobnobbing at black-tie events isn't his thing, Hoskinson made it clear that the world of crypto needs both tech nerds and diplomats. Balancing tech innovation with global collaboration is what keeps the ecosystem thriving.  

With strong plans for stablecoins, oracles, and Hydra scalability solutions in the pipeline, Cardano seems to be on the verge of another breakout year. Hoskinson teased multiple upcoming milestones, including a permanent constitution debate that could shape the future of the ecosystem.  

As $ADA hovers near the $0.98 mark, Cardano fans are gearing up for the next wave of transformations. Hoskinson's unconventional choices remind us that innovation isn't just about big speeches; it’s about staying curious and grounded in the real world.

Most of them did neither. However, this does not prevent Cardano from entering the Voltaire era. Let's examine the distribution of ADA coins just before the Plomin Hard Fork. For historical reasons, it is good to record the state in which Cardano will enter on-chain governance.

**Introducing Cardano Delegated Representatives (DReps)**

Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that empowers its community to participate in the decision-making process that shapes its future. In this governance model, DReps (Delegated Representatives) play a vital role. Any ada holder can register as a DRep or delegate their stake to one or more DReps who align with their interests. DReps cast votes on all governance matters, including parameter changes, treasury withdrawals, and hard forks. 

**Introducing DReps on the Cardano Forum**

Want to get to know the people who could be representing your voice in Cardano's governance? Check out the DRep introductions on the Cardano Forum: [https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/drep-introductions-and-updates/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/drep-introductions-and-updates/)

Is Cardano really a US-based crypto?,cardano,1i23pu7,2025-01-15 13:11:45,76,0.91,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1i23pu7/is_cardano_really_a_usbased_crypto/,cali_dave,General Discussion,"We've all heard the rumors about the US eliminating capital gains taxes for all US-based cryptos, and I've heard a lot of people talk about ADA being one of them. I'm a bit confused on ADA's status as a US-based crypto, and here's why:

The initial token launch took place in Japan. At the time, IOG was IOHK which was based out of Hong Kong. The Cardano Foundation is based in Switzerland. Emurgo was founded in Singapore. 

The Constitutional Convention took place in Argentina and Kenya. With Dreps and the new governance structure coming with the Plomin HFC, we can't really say Cardano is based anywhere. We certainly can't say it's based in the US if you look at the CF and Emurgo. IOG is based in the US, but as far as I know, IOG has no legal ties to the ADA token or Cardano outside of being contracted to develop and maintain the codebase. That's no different than a US-based company outsourcing their coding to India - it doesn't mean the product is based in India. 

I love that Cardano is decentralized and has roots all over the world, but I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around the idea that it's US-based. "
"Etymology of Vampire, Striga, Strix, Stlix",mythology,1i1n5sl,2025-01-14 21:17:56,5,0.79,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mythology/comments/1i1n5sl/etymology_of_vampire_striga_strix_stlix/,stlatos,European mythology,"Slavic \*netopyrĭ (Czech netopýr ‘bat’) seems to come from PIE \*nekWto-ptōr ‘night bird’ dissimilation of \*t-t (or \*nekWto-pet(H2)tōr ‘night-flyer’ with dissimilation of \*-et-et- or something similar).  For the forms, see :

\*kWrsino- > \*kWrsno- > Skt. kṛṣṇá-, OPr kirsnan ‘black’

\*kWrsir-ptor- ‘black bird’ > Av. Karšiptar-, Pahlavi Karšift (chief of birds, knows how to speak)



For likely \*pet(H2)tōr, see below.  The \*-i- to to explain how IE adj. in -ro- / -no- often had -i- in compounds.  The nom. with \*-ōr > \*-yr would have been unlike the rest of the cases, become detached from the paradigm, and been “fixed” by changing C- > i-stem.  This resembles the ending of Slavic \*(w)onpūr(ĭ) ‘vampire’, Bulgarian vampir, Czech upír and similar words.  Both seem to show the oddities expected in a PIE word in \*-ōr, with optional analogical reshaping of the word.  This probably came from the belief that some animals were really spirits or magicians that had transformed themselves, especially those seen only at night or with some ugly or fearsome features.



\*pet(H2)tōr is based on an equation of \*petH2- ‘extend / fly’.  The path:  \*petH2- > G. pítnēmi ‘spread (out/open)’, \*potH2mo- ‘breadth (of arms) as measure of distance (in water)’ > potamós ‘river’ (OIc faðmr, OHG fadam, OE fæðm ‘outstretched/encircling arms / embrace’, E. fathom.  Since other IE words for ‘shoulders / wings’ exist, it makes sense that \*petH2-(e)tro- / \*ptetro- / etc. > G. pterón, Skt. pátra- / páttra-, pátatra- ‘wing/feather’ (with t-t dissim. explaining pt- vs. p-t-, etc., -tr- / -ttr- / -tatr-).  This created a new root  \*petH2- ‘fly’.  The older presence of \*H2 in ‘fly’ & ‘wing’ is seen in 2 ex. of 3 cases of \*pH-p > \*s-p, etc. (based on https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalLinguistics/comments/1hvplxf/latin\_sy\_gen\_esyo\_%C4%AB/ ) :



The need for some \*pH > \*f > \*s > \*h in a specific environment is not odd, and even seems to be shared with G. (and Arm. also had \*p > \*f > ph vs. \*f > \*xW > h / 0).  In :



\*petH2- ‘extend / fly’, \*pi-pt(a)H2- > \*piH2-pt- > G. pī́ptō, Aeo. pissō ‘fall’, \*pi-pt(a)H2- > \*fH2i-pta- > \*sipta- > Koine híptamai ‘fly / rush’



\*pi(m)bH3- > Skt. píbati, Sic. pibe, Arm. ǝmpem ‘drink’ 

\*pi(m)bH3-leHno- > \*pH3imb-leHno- > Th. bímblinos \\ bimblínos ‘a kind of Thracian wine’, \*fHible:na > \*s- > \*h- > Cr. G. íbēna \\ bḗla ‘wine’



Since both these roots had both \*H & \*p-P, it is likely that H-metathesis created \*pH- > \*fH-, then \*f-P > \*h-P.  This dissimilation at a distance is also seen in optional ph-b > th-b :



\*bhleigW- > L. flīgere ‘strike (down)’, G. phlī́bō / thlī́bō ‘press’, Lt. bliêzt ‘beat’



and is very similar to :



\*pelHewyo- ‘grey’ > G. peleíā ‘rock-pigeon’, \*pelHi-ptH2tro- ‘grey bird’ > \*pelipHtro- > peristerā́ ‘dove/pigeon’



The connections between dull colors and doves make it likely that \*pelHto-s ‘grey’, \*pelH2- / \*pH2al- > Li. pelė ‘mouse’, pelėda ‘owl’, L. palumbēs ‘woodpigeon’, OPr poalis, etc., show that many grey & light grey animals were named solely from their color.  The r / l in peleíā \~ peristerā́ is seen in other G. words, often from Crete, and might be more common in words with r-r (see below) :



H. malittu- ‘sweet’, G. meilíssō / blíssō ‘soothe / soften’, Cr. britús ‘sweet / fresh’

G. Doric dī́lax ‘holm-oak’, NG Cretan azílakos / azírakos

\*derk\^- > G. dérkomai, \*delk- > deúkō ‘look’ (Cretan shows l > w:  Thes. zakeltís ‘bottle gourd’, Cret. zakauthíd-)

G. erébinthos \\ lébinthos ‘chick-pea’

G. \*wrapko- > rhákos ‘garment/rags/cloth’, pl. rhákē, Cr. lákē



If \*netopyrĭ & \*(w)onpūr(ĭ) were related, the order of changes could have been caused by \*nekWt- / \*nokWt- ‘night’ being a consonant stem, so the compound should have been \*nekWt-ptōr NOT \*nekWto-ptōr.  If so, \*nekWto-ptōr would have been a secondary analogical reshaping of all (or most) compounds in 1+o+2.  If so, original \*nokWt-ptōr would have a very odd C-cluster, so becoming simplified > \*nottpōr > \*no\_tpōr > \*ontpōr > \*onpūr (or something similar) is possible, with metathesis of \*n to fill in the mora left open.  Since most IE languages show \*nokWt-, \*nekWto-ptōr > \*netopūr(i) ‘bat’ has an odd or unexpected -e-, possibly due to PIE ablaut of some type, or even optional change of e > o by kW (a round k), like KWe \\ Pe > Po in Italic (O. Pompties).  Whatever the case, both \*nekWto-ptōr > \*netopūr(i) and \*nokWt-ptōr > \*onpūr seem likely, even if the exact steps are unclear.



Some linguists’ derivation of \*onpūr from ‘out-flying’, supposedly describing the vampires coming out of their graves, seem forced, and ignores the similar endings of it and \*netopūr(i).  The vampires being connected with bats and birds of prey that flew at night (owls, nighthawks, etc.) is likely very old, from the belief that some animals were really spirits or magicians that had transformed themselves.  Other similar creatures are known in IE myths, like female vampires, nightmares, etc. :

\*(s)treid- > L. strīdere ‘utter a shrill cry / shriek/screech/creak/hiss/whistle/etc.’, G. trízō ‘utter a shrill cry / scream/cry/crack/gnash the teeth/etc.’

\*strid-lo- > G. stríglos ‘long-eared owl’, \*strilg- / \*stlirg- / \*stling- > stlíx \\ strí(g)x ‘owl’ >> L. strix, gen. strigis ‘screech-owl’, striga ‘witch/vampire/etc.’



Here, l / r & \*dl > gl \\ bl also seen in :

\*dlākhōn > LB da-ra-ko, G. blḗkhōn, Dor. glā́khōn ‘pennyroyal’

\*dleukos > LB de-re-u-ko, G. gleûkos / deûkos ‘sweet new wine’, \*dluk\^u- ‘sweet’ > G. glukús, L. dulcis

\*derH3p- \\ \*drepH3- \\ etc. > G. drṓptō ‘examine’, Skt. dárpaṇa-m ‘eye’, \*dlepH- > G. blépō, Dor. glépō ‘look at / see’, blépharon ‘eyelid’



It seems clear that stríglos vs. \*strilg- / \*stlirg- / \*stling- > stlíx \\ strí(g)x shows changes to r-l (incuding perhaps l > r, r > l, and dissim. of \*r-r > r-n).  In the same way, ALL ex. of G. stl- seem to come from \*r-l :

I tried to make it where you could choose how you want to use the Hypercharge since she has two forms. Incase you can’t read my horrible handwriting here’s the text:

 Bonnie Hypercharge: The Greatest Stunt/Wisdom Tooth Wallop!
1. Upon landing when using her super (while in Clyde), a circle of bombs will launch in all directions from her jacket.
2. While using her super (while not in Clyde), load a Hypercharged shot that will fire in addition to the first shot fired. This shot does bonus damage and is not affected by her Wisdom Tooth Star Power.
OR
Alt.1. (While in Clyde) Bonnie takes inspiration from Janet, and drops bombs along the flight path of her super. *Black Powder Star Power does not increase the amount of bombs dropped, but rather spreads them out. *Second Hypercharge same as above.

*9 hits to charge hypercharge. Each grenade in multi-attack counts as 1/3 shot for hypercharge."

Some context for how the guild formed: On December 15th or 16th 2023 the guild leader of Existence is Pain got extremely frustrated because the heroic raid team had different goals than what he intended for the guild. So, the heroic raid team left the guild and decided to form a new guild called Obliterated, and I shortly joined after that, and am still in that guild now.

On February 2nd, I got the Reins of the Raven Lord:

I also got Fyr'alath, and was the first person in the guild to get it, though another paladin named Sarivan deserved to get it before me.

To be honest I’m not quite sure what I was thinking. Maybe I wasn’t thinking at all.

I poured some of this directly on my trees. maybe a tablespoon per tree. Then I read in tiny print on the back that this should be added in a minuscule amount. 

Have I just killed all my beloved trees in a momentary lapse of judgement?
I would be heartbroken."

Future Love Reading Spread,Tarotpractices,1hwgpgd,2025-01-08 05:02:59,2,1.0,2,https://i.redd.it/jttuw6q9uqbe1.jpeg,careful_coconut043,Interpretation Help,"Hi everyone!! So I decided to do a future love reading on myself and this is pretty much what I got from it. I’m curious to hear your perspectives! Is there anything else I might be missing, or are there any nuances you’d interpret differently? Thanks in advance for your help! 

Spread Reading: 
My Future Lover Tarot Spread: 

L at the top: The Lovers Card of the Major arcana, which can symbolize choosing Partner.

1st Card: Best Traits: their best qualities, attributes, or traits.

2nd Card: Love Language: their approach to love.

3rd Card: what should you know about them?

4th Card: timing/future: the timing of when you will meet them or what will happen in the future regarding this person. 

Cards I Pulled: 

1st Card: 2 of Cups UPRIGHT
- 1st Decan Cancer
- Water sign card
- Marriage, Connection, unified love, duality, balance
-    My future lover’s best qualities are their ability to build meaningful and balanced connections. They will value harmony and mutual respect in our relationship. This card tells me they are open to commitment and creating a deep emotional bond with me.

2nd Card: Queen of Cups UPRIGHT
- 3rd Decan Gemini
- 2nd Decan Cancer
- compassion, comfort, calm, nurturing, healing, emotionally capable. Stable, intuitive. Caring
-    Their love language is all about compassion and emotional depth. They’ll express their love by being nurturing, supportive, and intuitive. I can expect them to create a safe and comforting environment for me, always showing they care in thoughtful ways.

3rd Card: The Chariot UPRIGHT
- cancer card
- Water sign
- Taking control, movement, action, progress, determination, courage, direction, willpower
-       They are someone who is determined and ambitious, with a clear sense of direction in life. They’ve likely overcome challenges to reach a place of balance and control. I admire their resilience and their ability to focus on progress, which they’ll bring into our relationship to help us grow together.

4th Card: Temperance UPRIGHT
- Fire Card; Sagittarius
- Balance, harmony, moderation, patience, being sensible, purpose, finding meaning 
-     Meeting this person or building a future with them will require patience and balance. This card reassures me that everything will happen at the right time, and when it does, it will feel harmonious and purposeful. Our connection will develop steadily, grounded in mutual understanding and trust.
  
Overall Message:
This reading tells me my future partner will be someone who values emotional depth, balance, and mutual support. They’ll nurture and uplift me, while also being strong and determined. The Lovers card at the top confirms that this will be a significant, possibly life-changing connection. I just need to trust in the timing and let everything fall into place naturally. "

Mutation Plasmids don't award production until browser reload,EvolveIdle,1htklni,2025-01-04 13:20:07,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EvolveIdle/comments/1htklni/mutation_plasmids_dont_award_production_until/,Merlin_the_Tuna,Bug,"I started 4* runs recently and noticed a minor glitch with how plasmids you gain from genetic sequencing work -- or rather, how they don't quite work.

The No Starting Plasmids challenge gene means that you gain 0% production & storage boost from plasmids you have at the start of the run, just like it says on the tin. Genetic sequencing starts near the tail end of MAD, and mutations slowly award plasmids which *should* grant production/storage bonuses. However, it looks like **only** the storage component is granted when this happens, not the production component.

The workaround is simple enough -- reloading the browser window causes everything to update and the production bonus to kick in. But you'll need to do this every time you finish a round of mutation, which is annoying and could easily slow down a long run if you're not keeping tabs on it.

FWIW, I'm playing on Firefox, and it's possible that this is browser-specific. I've included a save file below that's 1 minute away from the first round of mutation if you'd like to see it in action. Wait for that to hit, then notice that none of the production tooltips include a plasmid boost, and that the plasmid tooltip says ""1 active Plasmids are providing a global production boost of **0%**. They also grant a spatial reasoning bonus to your storage of 0.08%"". Reloading the window updates all the production numbers and the plasmid tooltip to show the expected production boost of **0.69%**.

Obviously, backup your own save before importing this.

1. How’s this pally helmet? Better than shako?
2. My first CTA and my goodness look at that roll. I did not expect my life to go from 1700 to 2800 and for another Ohm to drop on my very next TZ stony field walk. Holy crap. "
Here is a post that I thought I would never make.,cats,1ht735k,2025-01-04 00:09:11,4,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1ht735k/here_is_a_post_that_i_thought_i_would_never_make/,StupidGiraffeWAB,Advice,"I am not your typical cat person. I never grew up with cats and my dad ""hated"" cats once they were no longer kittens. At this point in my life I just don't think he wanted to admit that cats can be pretty cool.

So... I had a pretty biased opinion on cats growing up. I didn't hate them, but I didn't necessarily like them.

Now that I am an adult I have realized that cats are something different than I had ever imagined. Some odd things have happened, like the multiple (5 at least) times that a friend's cat has been obsessed with me from the second I walked into their house. One time a friend was legitimately upset because this cat was pawing me, rubbing all up in my beard and literally licking me. This cat is usually elusive and not loving to anyone but that one friend. Literally every cat I come into contact with is chill as fuck, loveable and relatively easy to win over. 

I've come to the conclusion that cats know something... they see a challenge and feel the need to sway the naysayers. 

I've gone off topic. Enough about my reasoning for not owning a cat, whether it actually exists or not. My actual reason for posting is that I have a predicament. My daughter (just under 2 years) loves cats. I don't know where it came from but she is just is infatuated with them. My wife (always had cats around growing up) wants to adopt a cat, but we need some advice. 

My sister is severely allergic to cats and we have two large dogs (Great Dane and a Doberman). Our Doberman is definitely the ""guard dog"" type although he is 100% vocal and has never gotten physical with anything or anyone. Mostly a drep. Our Dane wouldn't care about anything being added to the family.

My main worry is my sister's allergies if she comes to our house to visit and the rough housing between our dogs.

What are some suggestions on breeds that would hold their own with dogs and be hypoallergenic? I'm leaning towards a siberian cat... maybe."

"Talking a bit about the JRPG's I played in 2024 (some non-jrpg's are in the pic, but I won't be discussing them in the post, hope that's fine since the majority are JRPG's)",JRPG,1hsf68k,2025-01-03 00:29:06,5,0.6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hsf68k/talking_a_bit_about_the_jrpgs_i_played_in_2024/,brando-boy,Review,"https://preview.redd.it/fpb254n4yoae1.png?width=3344&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b1c89a331493c064f224a0b99574a5237cdb17

hi, so, hope this is alright, i had a pretty packed 2024 when it came to gaming, and since most of them were jrpg's, i figured no better place than here to talk about a lot of them. if i played multiple from the same series, i'll group them together for the most part, and i'll try and stay pretty light on spoilers for all involved titles, so feel free to read even if you haven't played any of them!

  
first, the question that i'm sure everyone will be asking: ""how do you find the time?"" the rpg's alone would have people saying that, but mix in the other games and it's sure to come up. for me, this is honestly an incredibly easy question to answer: i play when i want to play. that's really it. i'm a mid 20's guy that works most days, not getting home until around 7pm most days or occasionally even later. i don't have kids or a partner, but i still have friends who i endeavor to hang out with whenever possible, be it actually going out or hopping on discord or something. all that to say that while i'm not the absolute busiest person in the world, i'm also not a teenager with infinite free time. i get home, i decompress or eat or whatever else i need, and then if i feel like playing and have nothing else going on, i play. on my off days, if i feel like playing something, i'll just play, if i don't, i won't. it sounds very simple, but that's bc for me at least it is. obviously everyone's circumstances are different, but in my experience, it's often the case that people just don't want to play as much as they claim they do, which is totally okay, but most people seem to get defensive when i bring this up so i won't dwell on it much

  
with all that said let's get into the meat of the post

i played 3 star ocean games, 1, 2, and 6. i really had fun with how 1 and 2 really allow you to just break the game wide open with all the abilities and skills and stuff, gimmicking the systems to effectively make infinite money and/or infinite level ups is really fun to me, and were solid experiences even outside of that. the divine force was... alright, not an outright bad game by any means, but definitely a significantly less fun experience than the other two, for me at least

i played the entire kingdom hearts franchise, and honestly i have a lot to say about these games, but i'll keep it relatively short for the sake of what's going to be an already very long post. long story short: the games are good and the story is easy to follow so long as you are actually paying attention. like 99% of the time, characters go out of their way to explain in no uncertain terms what the mechanics of things are and why things are happening and what characters are after, to the extent that i would say it does it a bit too much lol. it's a pretty normie opinion, but i do think 2 is overall the best, but my somewhat hot take is that 3 isn't very far behind. a somewhat weirdly paced final act doesn't take away from a lot of the good that the game has, and honestly 2's final act is a smidge weirdly paced as well.

atlus really came out swinging this year with 3 absolute bangers in persona 3 reload, shin megami tensei v vengeance, and metaphor refantazio. i knew some bits about persona 3 just kinda through osmosis over the years, but i had never actually played the game myself, and man did it live up to most of the hype. it usually takes a lot to make me cry but as the end approached i was absolutely a bit misty eyed, especially with some of the final social link catch-ups at the end. smt v vengeance took a game that i already liked, even if it was a bit flawed, and made it one that i love. the new scenario, the updated mechanics, and all of the new music all banged. and metaphor probably would've been my overall game of the year were it not for another title i'll be talking about a little later. the game tackles a ton of topics and themes that are probably the most pertinent they have ever been, and the overall meta commentary about how fiction can impact each and every one of us and push us to try and make positive changes in our communities is incredibly valuable. combine this with a lovable cast, an all-time great villain in louis, and the best parts of the smt and persona formulas and, for me, this is a title for the ages.

and while not wholly atlus developed, they did aide in the development and publishing of unicorn overlord, so may as well talk about that a little bit while i'm on the atlus section. another great game, the sheer amount of things that you can do with all the characters and the combinations you can make is so insane it's almost overwhelming. while a lot of characters may broadly cover the same overall niches (archer, fighter, mage, etc), no 2 characters within the same ""class"" are really the same, each having some unique abilities to distinguish themselves. on the downside, on the base difficulty the game is never really hard enough to take advantage of all these options, but still a fantastic game nonetheless

over the last several years, i had made it a sort of long-term goal to play every mainline final fantasy game (except the mmo's). i owned 13 when i was a kid years ago, played 15 when that released and again after all the dlc, 16 when it released, 7-12 from the switch ports, 6 on the snes classic i had. this only left 1-5, and the pixel remasters were the perfect opportunity for me (i have nothing against emulation, i just prefer official methods when possible and reasonably priced). 1-3 are simple enough, fun times and i greatly appreciate the foundation that they set down for everything in the future. 4 and 5 you see them really putting serious and significant effort into crafting real stories and characters, and as a lover of stories, i appreciate these 2 that much more for it. a minor attempt was made in 2, but the snes era was really a massive step up

wanna blow through a few of the singletons real quick  
\-the elden ring dlc was a great time, loved the base game, loved this. only real cause of any frustration was the final boss, but my issues with that boss were later patched so i imagine i would enjoy it significantly more now  
\-the ff16 dlc was fun, insane final boss and a fun expansion to the world and the lore  
\-tactics ogre reborn felt very difficult at times, but very satisfying to get things right  
\-ff tactics advance i played on and off pretty passively for a while, cute game, not super difficult and a nice little story  
\-valkyrie elysium, if we're even counting it as a jrpg was... alright as well. i have no attachment to the valkyrie profile series, so the massive departure in the gameplay didn't impact my perception, but even so, it was just fine. not terrible, definitely not great.

that just leaves one more. by far my favorite jrpg from 2024 (and my game of the year overall for what it's worth), was final fantasy 7 rebirth. i could probably write several essays about this game, but again, i'll try and keep it somewhat short. basically this felt like a game that should not exist. the scope and the sheer amount of love and passion put into every single piece of the game was apparent during every second of my playthrough. i put 70-80 hours into this game in under 10 days and did nearly everything you can possibly do in a single playthrough, i would get home from work and play for hours, on my off days i would wake up and practically go straight from my bed to my chair and play the entire day, only taking quick breaks to eat or use the bathroom or something. basically if you needed to reach me during that time, tough luck bc i was so invested that i practically did not exist. i loved the minigames, i loved most of the sidequests, i loved just running around the world and exploring, i loved the music, i loved the cast, i loved the expansion of the world and the implementation of spin-off content, and yes i loved the story. even the ending. the more i've sat with it and my own thoughts with it as well as seeing the theories and opinions of others, the more i'm supremely confident that they are going to stick the landing. the decisions regarding the ending were bold to be sure, but they were also incredibly intentional, and considering that intentionality, i trust that they have the full intent of providing players with the emotional catharsis they desire, just not at the moment most players wanted it, but saying any more than that and i'll probably have to get into spoilers which i don't want to for the main post (we can talk about it in the replies if anyone wants). everything about this game just felt magical to me, and even if part 3 somehow completely flops everything, i think as a standalone game rebirth can largely stand on its own merits among the greats

but anyway, if this post stays up and you read it all the way through, hope you enjoyed, i'm more than happy to chat a bit more in-depth about any of the games i talked about here (or any of the other games in the pic if anyone is at all interested, despite this being a bit of a different crowd lol) in the comments. hope everyone is having a happy new year so far!"

Literally 3 drops later and this drops! First time ever for me. Very poor role but not too fussed. Having a character that is literally only viable if you can get your hands on one of the rarest items in the game tells you everything you need to know about how D2!
