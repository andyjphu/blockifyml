However, the community is demanding an audit.

The Binance Proof-of-Reserves report, led by Changpeng Zhao, now shows 24 assets after the addition of 11 new tokens. The newly included tokens are Mask Network (MASK), Enjin Coin (ENJ), WazirX (WRX), The Graph (GRT), Chromia (CHR), Curve Token (CRV), 1Inch Network (1INCH), PowerPool (CVP), Hashflow (HFT), SSV Network (SSV), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

With today's announcement, Binance can boast the largest reserves worth over $63 billion. However, the community believes that PoR alone is not enough.

# Binance updates Proof-of-Reserves, but an audit is still missing

According to Binance's PoR, assets are backed by a minimum of 100% reserves. USDC has the highest support of 5490.55%.

Last month, the company introduced ZK-SNARKs to improve user privacy during verification. In addition, it opened its code to help other exchanges adopt this feature.

However, more than Proof-of-Reserves is needed for full transparency. Therefore, the community is demanding an audit report. Regarding the audit, Binance's Asia-Pacific CEO Leon Foong explained that ""it will take more time."" He justified this by stating that accounting firms do not specialize in cryptocurrencies.

Auditing firm Mazars resigned from Binance after issuing a controversial first report. In addition, the Big Four accounting firms - Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers - do not want to cooperate with the exchange. Meanwhile, Deloitte continues to audit Coinbase's financial reports."

Buying Hashflow on Binance vs BingX  


Trading Fees  
Cryptocurrency trading is similar to stock trading, but with cryptocurrencies as the only traded assets. It occurs on exchanges, where fees can vary based on the user's 30-day trading volume. Understanding exchange fees is important for developing profitable trading strategies.  


Exchanges have different fee structures, some charge a flat rate for all trades, others charge a percentage of the trade value. Some exchanges offer discounts for high volume traders or users who hold memberships.  


Binance charges 0.1% for both maker and taker fees, with discounts available for BNB holders or large volume traders. BingX charges 0.075% for both maker and taker fees.  


Fee comparison table:

It's token, HFT is an ERC-20 token and also a token of the hashverse with lots of utilities.
Staking it will qualify a user to participate in the DAO governance, taking decisions necessary for the betterment of the Hashflow's protocol.

It's a gift of ceFi-DeFi combo exchange to the crypto space. I am lucky being a hashgang as ceFi goes DeFi.

KuCoin [crypto exchange](https://www.kucoin.com/) remains committed to discovering the next hidden gems in the crypto space and so we are actively adding new coins to our platform all the time. Previously, we posted all listing-related info in the Subreddit to keep everyone informed. However, some users feel that the method is a bit spammy, so we are trying another way to deliver such info.

We will now start summarizing all listing-related info within the week into one post so that you can easily get the whole picture, as well as find detailed information regarding each listing.
