I recently completed a purchase of a used R1T and am super stoked to join the tribe here.

I know that with used Rivians it can take a few days to get things transferred over to the new account. Is there anything I can start doing to expedite the process? I have the VIN and documentation. Or do I need to wait until the vehicle arrives to connect the app?

She says she stands as an example for young Muslim girls and Somali girls. but then in Somali she calls a tribe fake Somalis.

In English she is America first, in Somali she says she came into power to serve Somalis.

She went on personal trips to her tribal elders, promised to come back and has ambitions to be the first female politician in that region.

The Royal Adventuring Company. A foray into fantasy.,RoleplayPartnerSearch,1i9wymz,2025-01-25 16:02:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1i9wymz/the_royal_adventuring_company_a_foray_into_fantasy/,Painlash,M4F,"Hi, I'm Pain and I have an idea for a roleplay where we each take half of an adventuring team. Essentially a DnD group that takes quests and wanders through all the lands in search of adventure. I want to specify that this is a 1 on 1 roleplay and each of us would play multiple characters. I don't have an interest in using rules or dice but more of a conventional roleplay. We're meant to overcome the obstacles set before us and have fun along the way. 

A bit about me and my writing style: I write exclusively third person, past tense and I typically write in three to six paragraphs. I'm able to get at least one reply a day (usually before I go to bed, so you'll have something to wake up to). More on the weekends since I can dedicate much more time to roleplaying on my days off. 

What I'm looking for in a partner: Be literate, willing to play multiple characters, get excited about the roleplay and bring your ideas and passions on board as well. I'm looking for someone that just wants to tell a phenomenal story with me so in that interest you should be able to match my writing style and post length. 

I want to be able to laugh at the hijinks, gush over the romances, and generally have a great time. If you think this sounds like you then feel free to reach out! I roleplay exclusively on discord, in a private server that we'll make to fit the roleplay. I'm also open to multiple roleplays simultaneously as we both come up with new ideas. 

I have a starter written out to act as my writing sample and a basic start for the roleplay. Here it is: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard dad! I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Ti‚ÄôRel said, kicking a stick in frustration. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just do it like all the other kids?‚Äù



His father, a large orc who stood behind him with his arms crossed. ‚ÄúIt is exactly why you should not do it like the other kids, it is hard.‚Äù His deep, gruff voice said patiently. ‚ÄúIf a thing is harder, then only doing it will make it easier. The other children will learn how to make fire the easy way but not us. We will do this our way. For we are not like the other kids, are we Ti‚ÄôRel?‚Äù



‚ÄúBut I want to be like the other kids. Their dads teach them how to use swords and axes. I don‚Äôt even like magic, daddy.‚Äù Ti‚ÄôRel whined. 



‚ÄúBut magic likes you, little one.‚Äù Tu‚ÄôRa said, never breaking that patient tone. ‚ÄúYou will master magic before it has a chance to master you. Now, again. Hands out, clear your mind and focus on the branch. Channel that anger into it.‚Äù 



Ti‚ÄôRel had sat there for hours with his father, just trying to light a branch on fire. If he had succeeded, then his father would stomp it out and make him start again. That was how it was with everything. His father had pushed him until even the boys and girls learning to fight with swords and axes felt sorry for him. Other orcs would challenge Tu‚ÄôRa often, that he was pushing the boy too far. Tu‚ÄôRa would always stare them down, challenging them to raise their own children how they would‚Ä¶ the easy way. To make their children as soft as they wished for his own son would reach his potential. 



It was not until he lost Tu‚ÄôRa in a raid, several years later that he truly appreciated his father for the first time. He Tu‚ÄôRel had always thought his father cold and uncaring but he had not hesitated to take a blade meant for the boy. He had been fighting several of the human barbarian‚Äôs that they shared the Skatlivi mountains with and holding his own while Tu‚ÄôRel cowered, unsure of how to help or where to jump in. 



He made a vow that day, as the flames licked from his small hands like demonic tongues and struck to ashes, the barbarians that had cut his father down. His tears were dried on his cheeks as flames danced all around him, consuming every human in sight one after another. He burned the entire raiding party as if they were dried leaves along the ground.



It wasn‚Äôt until hours later, that he returned to his father‚Äôs corpse, burning it away to ashes and letting them blow in the wind that those tears truly settled back onto his cheek. He was smaller than the other orcs, still larger than most humans but his muscles were not trained in the tortures of constant battle training as his father‚Äôs had been. 



The chief had deemed him a man that day, a thing none in the tribe ever expected. He had been blooded and suddenly his kills rivaled their greatest warriors. He left his home, though. Unable to bear the memories it held of his father. He never received the tattoo‚Äôs that marked him a great warrior in his people‚Äôs eyes, for he did not care for their eyes. He had been a pariah, an outcast, and he understood now that his father had pushed him so hard because he knew there would be no warriors to cover his flank. He would fight alone, and his strength would have to stand on it‚Äôs own. 



It took him a long while to reach the city of Denerim. A long journey for a person not used to traveling from his home at all. Many times, he was assaulted by bandits, some were simply normal bandits and some were the bastard barbarians that had taken his father. He turned each to ash, proving himself to be no easy prey. 



After several months, and several villages he had been sitting in one of the towns taverns when the tavern owner suggested he go to one of the towns three schools. At first, he thought the school of magic would be a brilliant place to find those like him but they wouldn‚Äôt even entertain him before kicking him from their grounds. He had no interest in the warriors school but finally he landed on the messy, unkempt grounds of the adventurers academy and for the first time since his father had accepted him, he was listened to. The receptionist set him up with an interview to see if he was right for the school. 



A large minotaur led him to one of the small offices where he was interviewed and after a short demonstration of his abilities, he was accepted without having to pay the intake fee. They didn‚Äôt often see orcs this far from the mountains but with his gift of fire, they were excited to have him. 



After spending years in the Adventuring Academy, where he was taught the basics of traveling and surviving in rough terrain as well as how to approach diverse situations he graduated and was able to walk from those hallowed halls and unkempt grounds with a letter of recommendation that should have netted him any contract he wanted.



Weeks of being rejected from adventuring troupe‚Äôs and mercenary companies proved the uselessness of that particular piece of paper. Every group that interviewed him assumed he was a warrior, due to his race and he was nearly always laughed out of the interview when he told them that he was a mage. Orcs didn‚Äôt raise mages, it was well known. 



He began to lose hope until a town crier announced there would be a competition set up by the King. Apparently, he wanted to set up a royal adventuring company that would extend his interests in places where armies were impractical for either political or more mundane reasons. They would act as scouts or investigators when the King had a reason to send them off. It would represent a steady income, and the benefits of acting with royal authority.

Kenya the place to visit atleast once in your life,KenyaOfficial,1i9wsma,2025-01-25 15:55:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenyaOfficial/comments/1i9wsma/kenya_the_place_to_visit_atleast_once_in_your_life/,OnlineCashDevil,,"I am a caucasian man from young mid age, and i went to kenya a few times and it was lovely. before i traveled to kenya i have been always like a  family man towards my parents since my father was very sick and so i had other duties than myself maybe, my father passed away and some time after that i made plans to come to kenya after i was invited, there i didn't know what to expect from Kenya because i had never been in africa, only seen from Tv and school when i was a kid, i thought about a country with wild animals, villages but woow Kenya is so much more and modern and evoulated.  It is really very beautiful and Nairobi is a big city with many beautiful buildings. It is really very beautiful and Nairobi is a big city with many beautiful buildings and lovely people who call out to you and are happy to see you, you immediately feel welcome as if you were at home.

The food, well that's a feast for the mouth, i enjoyed all the traditional dishes such as ugali, chapati (madondo), sukuma, nyama choma and so much more nice foods the kenyans have for you.

There are so many nice places you can visit, everything is there... Beautiful ocean, beautiful forest and wildlife, or going out and shopping in a few beautiful city's like Nairobi, Mombassa and nakuru for example, there is something to do for everyone and everyone will love kenya!

Kenyans have different tribes, for example the Maasai which you see often and recognize on their traditional clothes, i believe the biggest and most common tribe is kikuyu like the former president from kenya, the offical language which you will hear most is Swahili and next English or different tribe languages.

You should really visit Kenya but you have to understand, visting Kenya is falling in love with Kenya

I love kenya to be honest, definetely kenya count so much people who are so nice and welcoming, I have always loved kenya since i came very first day, would have loved to invest, open a bussines, buy or build a house and settle one day but i think i closed myself out and nobody in kenya takes guilt i am aware that i better don't come back and leave you people live your life without this white man who always complains (doesn't matter if it was with my good reason or not or what hapenned) i gues it's me. I am the problem and i am not that smart and not really grown up yet and i am pathetic, i don't know about life yet i guess. I guess we all have a different story and should understand each other and i appreciate how people understand me even when i am wrong, i will keep my stories for myself in the little ramaining future. So wherever i said something wrong or have tried to share some experiences or where i maybe tried to protect myself and i was wrong to do so, my aplogies for all this. I never meant to say anything bad about Kenya and honestly it won't realy make me happy, i thought i could maybe help but probably i wasn't aware from somethings in this life maybe. So with all this said once again my aplogies, i promise here that kenyans won't have a problem with me again and i think i go nowhere again, i really wish you people all the best in life from the bottom of my heart. Take care Rafikis"

DeMonT,schizoposters,1i9vuy6,2025-01-25 15:13:38,25,0.96,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vuy6,Henrolfo_22,deranged fella ,"Hey fellow loonies. I can‚Äôt help but feel like the DMT fractal jesters/clowns are the bound spirits of the nephilim trapped in the spirit realm. 

Anyone else find it odd when DMT users encounter these creatures they feel a sense of awe and astonishment‚Äîlike they have to accept the entity as a ‚Äúhigher being‚Äù from a ‚Äúhigher‚Äù plane? I think this plane where DMT entities or spirits reside just beyond the veil of the material world, where they linger incorporeally. 

If we assume these entities are in fact nephilim spirits, this realm serves as sort of ‚Äúpipeworks‚Äù or foundation for our material world‚Äîthe source of its beauty and colour. 

After being decimated by the flood, the nephilim spirits are  said to reside here, awaiting judgement by God. Could it be these beings are waiting in this hyperspace? Just beyond the scope of human perception? 

Many cultures, namely south of the equator, use compounds like DMT to channel ‚Äúancestor‚Äù spirits, or the ‚ÄúGods‚Äù who make up their tribal pantheon‚Äîthe creators of their culture and society. Even in remote tribes, these ancestor spirits often have a strikingly similar appearance to colourful clowns. An example of this is the heyoka from Sioux cultures.

Some theorize the contemporary western image of a clown is in fact a theatrical, Masonic representation of what the nephilim looked like (pale skin, blood-red lips). 

Isn‚Äôt it odd some people have an innate fear of clowns in the same way they might fear serpents? The rabbit hole goes really deep.

Nairobi:

Tribe Hotel ‚Äì Nairobi ‚Äì [https://www.tribe-hotel.com/](https://www.tribe-hotel.com/)

The bathrooms are uh, not good for couples or families. You will hear, smell everything, and see some things.

This hotel is located near the US Embassy and the UN headquarters. It is safe and there is a huge mall across the street. The hotel is clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was lively at night and we enjoyed the cocktails.

We took a tour via UJV and Martin, who took us to the Elephant Orphanage, Giraffe Center, and then the Karen Blixen Museum. ¬†It was nice to see the city while driving between venues. We enjoyed all of these activities but a word of caution with the Giraffe Center that it is more of a zoo than a conservancy. When you arrive, you will be given a dish of food to feed the Giraffes. The Giraffes have options to not interact at least.

Lodge 1:

Wilson Airport to Amboseli

Angama Amboseli - [https://angama.com/](https://angama.com/)

We flew into the airport within the Amboseli National Park, however there is a private airstrip in the Kimana Conservancy. We were met with breakfast at the airstrip and then were able to see Amboseli before heading to Angama. In a perfect world, I would land at Amboseli and fly out at the private airstrip. It‚Äôs about 1 hour 40 minutes to the airstrip at the national park from Angama. Our guide, Salash, was fabulous! Every game drive was private.

The resort is beautiful and located in the private Kimana Conservancy. The cottages are gorgeous. The bathroom is huge, with a two-person shower and a large room with a toilet and a door! There is an outdoor sitting area and an outdoor shower. The cottages do not get too hot and we were quite comfortable during our stay. James was our room attendant, and everything was perfect. He did far more laundry for us than he should have.

From our room, we were able to see quite a bit of wildlife! Elephants, monkeys, etc. The conservancy does have cats but the elephants, hippos, and all the other animals are why you visit. We were even able to meet Craig!

They don‚Äôt have a gym. They have a pool and offer a ‚Äúgym bag‚Äù in your room. They offer beading, weaving, and photography classes.

Their beverage program was amazing. Lots of wonderful South African wines that we wish we could get in the USA. The food has some room to get better but I figure [u/DorsiaTravel ](https://www.reddit.com/user/DorsiaTravel/)will fix them right up when he visits soon.

This resort needs bug spray.

Lodge 2:

Amboseli to Lewa - We were supposed to fly back to Wilson but the SafariLink added a few stops and flew ‚Äúdirect‚Äù instead.

Elewana Kifaru House - [https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance](https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance)

This lodge has 5 cottages at the top of the hill for great views. The cottages are clean, comfortable, and cool. The weather at Lewa is quite a bit cooler which also means you don‚Äôt need bug spray. They do warn you to keep the lights off at night so that moths are not attracted.

Our guide, Phillip, was terrific. There were issues with the car, so we ended up having an extra guide, Michael, to help drive. All the drives happen within the Lewa Conservancy. We were able to see white and black rhinos, cheetahs, elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes, bush babies, and several baby lions!

The food and beverage were fine, with no complaints. The chef ensured I had fresh-baked gluten-free breads (I have celiac) and even made me gluten-free churros!

Lodge 3:

Lewa to Samburu ‚Äì we had a chartered flight and flew direct (15 minute flight).

Saruni Samburu - [https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/](https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/)

This lodge is located within Kalama Conservancy but all the animals were within the Samburu National Reserve. During the rainy periods, the game drives would be within Kalama.

This place is magical. Kalama is semi-arid and very hot. Despite this, the rooms were cool at night and we were comfortable. It was very hot during the day but there are two pools to cool down. Because the rooms are built into the side of the mountain, you can get a nice wind tunnel to keep the rooms cool. I will say that this place is not very accessible. If you are scared of heights, have any physical challenges, or younger kids, you might skip this place. They have a great gift shop too!

Samoru was our guide and he was fantastic. He‚Äôs an elder in the Samburu tribe and went out of his way to find us a leopard. We also saw a red spitting cobra, stripped hyena, leopard, rock hyrax, and so much more.

Saitoti was our food and beverage person and he was such an amazing teacher. We learned a lot about his culture and his language! They even had gluten free pasta for me.

Lodge 4:

Samburu to Keekorok (Masai Mara)

JW Marriott - [https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/)

This lodge is located very close to the local community and we could hear goats, cows, and kids playing in the river from our room. The cottages are beautiful. Ours had a (very cold) pool and a sauna. We were also treated with some very cute guests who left us a free presents on our deck, 10 or so baboons!

¬†They have a rotating menu but will make you anything you want with enough time. Anything. The beverage program was reasonable and included quite a few high-end options.

We were staying here on points and I am guessing most folks were also. I do not believe the service was up to the same level as the other lodges but this resort still expects 2,600/night for 2 people. The issues were issues and one of them was serious.

¬†¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They feed me gluten even though I have celiac. I mentioned needing gluten-free food at every meal. I found out the last morning that the hashbrowns have gluten.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The rooms are at least 10 degrees hotter than the outside temperature during the day.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Only one side of the bed had a heating pad.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The game drives happened in a public park, and it was a rodeo. The animals were stressed, we were worried, and it was not a good situation for anyone.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It does not seem like you have dedicated staff like other lodges.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You are limited to 10 laundry items for the lodge, 5 per person a day. This is no limit at other lodges.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Shared game drives unless you paid for a private one. This meant we were with a couple that wanted to see ‚Äúa kill‚Äù which we were not interested in. When our guide heard about a lion killing a warthog, we had to leave a beautiful leopard and speed over to the scene. It was pretty horrifying because the warthog was still alive while the lion was eating it. The lion got spooked by all the guides (mostly JW vehicles) jockeying for position and left the warthog. The warthog tried to get up despite missing internal organs. It was horrifying. We had to listen to people laughing while watching it.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It is very Westernized. They had a bar, they had music on, and everyone was using their ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù name.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Make sure you pay your park fees before arriving if possible because you need cash otherwise. The hotel will not make this easier for you. You must have the $200 in cash, hope their credit card machine works (it didn‚Äôt one day), or go to an ATM.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The pre-approval questionnaire was not looked at before or after our arrival.

I know their reviews are excellent, and I am guessing that is because people are going to this lodge and have not experienced other lodges or conservancies in Kenya.

I believe it is a trilogy, but I only member two of the books. They were about two kids who happen to find cryptids. The first book was about some intelligent sloth-like creatures in the amazon. I think the boy is from America and the girl is from a native Amazonian tribe. One of the other books involved yetis, the Himalayas, and Shangri-la. I have searched high and low for this series, but haven't had much luck due to the fact that I was getting them and Cryptid Hunters jumbled together in my brain.

Also, I think the titles of the books referenced the setting of the books in some stereotypical YA novel way (like ""___ in the ___"")"

Pretendians in the Workplace. What to do?,Indigenous,1i9vb3a,2025-01-25 14:49:15,12,0.87,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indigenous/comments/1i9vb3a/pretendians_in_the_workplace_what_to_do/,New-Supermarket-9249,,"I've been at a new job for just over a year now, and I am so uncomfortable with this person at work and I don't know what to do, or if maybe I am actually the problem. I am status. My mom is Indigenous and my dad is Hungarian, so I am somewhat light skinned but most people who have been around indigenous communities can tell that I'm Indigenous. 


Recently we hired someone who claims to be Indigenous, which doesn't really bother me in and of itself. But what does bother me is the way this person has attached themselves to me like we're the only two Indig in the whole company when I don't know them or their ""community"" and I don't believe they are Indigenous. They are half Latino and a member of a pretty well known ""pop-up tribe"", which did not exist even like 30 years ago. They have said they do not know which indigenous Latin American community they belong to, but they have made it a point to mention that they have more ""Native DNA"" than me because of their Mexican heritage. 


They say things like ""oh yes *we* Natives don't drink. It's against *our* ways"" when I casually mentioned that I personally don't drink. They even talk about how Natives don't drink because we basically can't control ourselves, which I honestly find kind of offensive. I know plenty of Indigenous people who drink without alcoholism. It seems like everything they know about being Indigenous are harmful stereotypes and they just assume that those things apply to me.  They talk openly at work about trauma and residential schools, even though they have no connection to any schools, and I don't think that's an appropriate topic for work, especially when you're basically asking for details of how I connect to that trauma, as if I need to prove that my family has suffered enough to earn that status card. 


They also often make subtle derogatory comments about status in general (""Government Indians"" kind of talk), and call themselves a ""healer"" and spiritualist, and talk about how they and I have a stronger connection to land/nature to other coworkers. These topics never come up when they engage with other non-indig employees. Its like they don't know how to talk about anything else with me. I'm trying not to be difficult, and I understand that many Mexicans do have indigenous ancestry, but I feel that's very different from being part of an Indigenous community, and the Indigenous community up here that they *are* part of is objectively not a legitimate First Nation. I feel they use their physical appearance to mislead people about their status, and it's starting to effect my work because I now try to avoid them and the office in general whenever I can.
 

I feel like I can't go to HR about it because not only are they ""enrolled"", they are also Queer(their words)and disabled, so I feel like I will look like a bully. And maybe it's not right for me to feel the way I do, but I just don't feel any connection to this person, and I'm exhausted with fielding so much of their commentary just because I happen to be (I think) the only other person claiming to be Indigenous in the office. 


Has anyone else had to deal with this? Am I being over-sensitive? What is the best way to proceed? I feel like if I were to confront this person I would end up being the one reprimanded since I'm basically questioning their identity. "

"AITA for thinking this person is a ""pretendian""",AITAH,1i9uty6,2025-01-25 14:28:25,2,0.75,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9uty6/aita_for_thinking_this_person_is_a_pretendian/,BeeBeePinkie,,"So, I (30F, Desi) recently met this person, M (32NB), through my friend group. They claim to be Ojibwe Native American, but their stories about their culture are a bit strange. They've told me a few different things about their background, starting with being half Irish and half Native American, then full Native American on both sides, and most recently half African American, half Native American (mom & dad respectively for all of those). I haven't met their family, so I can't confirm any of it.

M has told me some ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù things about their culture that I've never heard before, but then I don‚Äôt know many other Native Americans personally. Still these seem strange: Like how their tribe uses their bare hands to catch and kill pests like mice, or how they can‚Äôt be friends with people from other Tribes because of ancient rules (M says their ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have a friend in the Bear Clan in spite of that). They also say Native Americans as a whole only use herbal medicine, even though their mom supposedly works as a nurse in Western medicine.

They've also said how public schools and colleges won't accept them because of racism (they were homeschooled, but sometimes this changes to being educated until graduation in senior year), or how it's okay for white people to write creepy stories about skinwalkers and wendigos because they're ‚Äúreal‚Äù (likened them to wolves & eagles, cause they‚Äôre important in Native American culture but people still write about them). They even denied the history of white Christian boarding schools trying to ""civilize"" Native Americans.

The other day, we were out with a black friend, and he unfortunately experienced some racial slurs, like the N word. But M later told the rest of our friend group that the abuse was aimed at them exclusively. We said nothing, cause we didn‚Äôt want to stir drama.

I left this to last because I know it‚Äôs a nuanced situation: M is also white. But still claim to be a POC, who faces the same racial stereotyping and abuse of any other POC. You can see now why the N word thing was particularly weird now. 

I‚Äôm trying to just avoid this person but since they're now pretty merged with my friend group, I do want to tell people. But I feel like an asshole, talking about a culture I really don‚Äôt know much about.  
I said recently to one white friend who just told me that M has mental health problems and that any ‚Äúweird‚Äù stuff they say is because of their autism.

Only this dumb dumb is not smart enough to understand history.

Mussolini's took over British Somaliland for a short while. In this time he had no control over the people, just like Churchill had no control over the tribes. 

Mussolini in that time was brandishing himself as the savior of several religious minorities. Many don't know he got something called the sword of islam. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Islam_(Mussolini)

Mussolini sought to present Italy as a benefactor to European Jews, contrasting himself with Hitler's extreme anti-Semitic policies. By offering British Somaliland as a potential settlement, he could portray Italy as a more moderate power in dealing with the ""Jewish question.""

Mussolini was pursuing colonial ambitions in East Africa, and settling Jews in British Somaliland could serve as a way to consolidate Italian influence in the Horn of Africa. It aligned with his larger plan of expanding the Italian Empire after the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Funny enough this greater plan was called; Greater East Africa. Something which is also copied by Daroodism pseudo-scholars into Somaliweyn. 

Mussolini had, at times, supported Zionist efforts to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, as a way to counter British dominance in the region. Offering British Somaliland was likely an extension of this tactic, aimed at gaining favor with Zionist leaders while antagonizing Britain. He also knew Brittain would never want to give it up, and also not come up with a good solution for the European Jews. 

Fascism and Zionism is a happy marriage.

And faqash are fascists. All fascists need to end up like Mussolini and his wife"

With that out of the way, time to introduce you to the rest of the current roster: 

Boggarts,Goblins,Hobgoblins and Orks ( Orkus horibilis) ‚Äî collectively known as orkoids, these creatures are a species of semi-eusocial apes closely related to gorillas. Despite their radical differences, boggarts, goblins and orks are all the same species. This is because they are simply different castes, like how soldier ants and worker ants of the same species can look radically different. Hobgoblins are different, though. They are an offshoot of regular goblins that broke off from orkoid society in order to escape their oppresion at the hands of the orks, becoming nomadic hunters on the steppes of Central Asia and starting trade with the Ogre Kingdoms. Orkoid tribes are ruled by a single dominant male called a Warboss and his harem consisting of the few fertile females called Queens. Because of this, jealous males will often try to overthrow the Warboss and take his place, leading to full blown civil wars among tribes.  While this is the main reason for ork infighting, it can and does break out for little to no reason. When not fighting eachother, they will attack the settlements of other sophont species, most notably, those of humans, elfs and dwarfs.
 
What follows is an overview of all the different castes of orkoid: 

‚Äî Boggarts: these are the smallest of the orkoid castes, they are regularly not much bigger than a human toddler, they posses long, pointy ears and large noses
‚ÄîGoblins: Standing slightly shorter than a human man, they are the worker caste of an orkoid tribe. They posses pointed ears and noses, although they are considerably smaller than those of boggarts 
‚ÄîHobgoblins: not an actual caste, per se, rather, a population of goblins that became independent from the rest of orkish society. They stand as tall as a man and have hunched backs covered in thick,bony armour
‚ÄîOrks: standing taller than goblins but still shorter than a man, orks are the warrior caste of an orkoid tribe. Although, some males can grow as tall or even taller than most humans, with Warbosses towering over even the tallest of men. Possesing bodies covered from head to toe in muscle and large tusks portruding from their lower jaws, they are as terrifiying from a distance as they are up close 

The skin of all orkoids is either grey or a muted brown

Wargs ( Amphicyon tolkienii) ‚Äî the last extant species of amphicyonid, wargs serve as mounts for the hobgoblin tribes that plague the steppes of Central Asia

Warboars ( Sus scrofa bellator) ‚Äî a subspecies of boar that was selectively bred by the orks into becoming hyperaggresive war mounts. While they are still omnivores, their diet now primarily consists of meat

Razurks/Razorbacks ( Orkus horibilis x Sus scrofa) ‚Äî genetic chimeras of goblins and wild boars, they were created thousands of years ago by an ancient fleshcrafter cult, distinct from the one that created the minotaurs, which had taken up residence in the Near East and Anatolia 

Ogres ( Ogrus gulosus) ‚Äî massive, fat bodied distant relatives of the orkoids, ogres are a truly grotesque sight. They are endemic to Mongolia, Western China and the surrounding regions, living in vaguely connected dominions called the Ogre Kingdoms. At first glance, their culture resembles those of the mongols and the huns, but this is only surface level. The culture of the ogres revolves almost completely around eating. While they will eat basically anything, human flesh is considered a delicacy and have set up trade with hobgoblin tribes in order to aquire it whenever they want 

Mountain Trolls ( Troglodytarum alpinum) ‚Äî the largest species of troll, these apes inhabit the mountains of Scandinavia in small family units. They also have slower metabolisms which means that they don't have to search for food as often as other trolls

Forest Trolls ( Troglodytarum sylvanus) ‚Äî close relatives of T. alpinum that inhabit the forests of Northern Europe 

River Trolls ( Troglodytarum paludis) ‚Äî a species of troll that have adapted to living in rivers and swamps and are occasionally encontered under bridges. They all have algae covering their bodies 

Snow Trolls ( Troglodytarum niveus) ‚Äî a species of troll that inhabits the Northmost regions of Scandinavia 

All trolls posses tails of varying lengths as a result of an atavism 

Manticores ( Manticorus imperator) ‚Äî a species of baboon, possibly related to the extinct Dinopithecus, that has evolved a body plan similar to those of big cats, a mane of hair like those of lions, a shortened, uncannily human-like face and quills derived from hair folicles at the end of the tail which can secrete an excruitatingly painful toxin (P.S. their scientific name is taken from the manticores of the Cryptobiology series by youtuber Thought Potato because I couldn't come up with one myself) 

Devil Monkeys ( Diablopithecus anthropophagus) ‚Äî a species of baboon with jet black skin and hair and bright red eyes. Standing as tall as a man, they hunt in enormous troops numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. They are the scourge of Eurasia. They are man's natural predator 

European Unicorns ( Monoceros europaeus) ‚Äî a species of perissodactyl endemic to Europe within the clade monocerotidae, a family of odd-toed ungulates closely related to horses. They posses a single bony horn on their forehead used in intraspecific combat and for detering predators 

Indian Unicorns ( Monoceros indicus) ‚Äî a close relative of M. europaeus inhabiting the Indian Subcontinent 

Siberian Unicorns ( Elasmotherium sibiricum) ‚Äî no further explanation needed 

Great Siege Beasts ( Brontotherium tolkienii) ‚Äî the last surviving brontothere, these enormous perissodactyls posses a thick, bony plate on their heads that extends outwards, forming a massive horn. They are native to Northern Africa and the Middle East, and, as their name suggests, are often used in sieges, being used to pull siege towers and enormous battering rams "

*‚ÄúAbout a minute after I exhaled, I had the feeling of being surrounded by large invisible things studying me.‚Äù* 

This is from part of a report by a user of *bufo*, slang for the 5-HO-DMT, which is found in the toxin cocktail of the Colorado River Toad. Huffing the secretions of terrified amphibians is just one of the many ways man has sought to achieve an altered state of consciousness. However, hallucinogenic compounds are not often produced in the animal kingdom. So besides smoking toads, there are few known psychedelic animals.  
  
Before diving into the others, let's give the river toad its due. Also called the Sonoran Desert Toad, the Colorado River Toad is native to a relatively small swath of North America, with a habitat spanning from the deserts of Arizona to the grasslands of Mexico. It lives most of its life underground in a protective mucus burrow to escape the heat of the day. Depending on the area and season, the toads can stay underground in hibernation until the sound of rain awakens them. From there, it is a mad scramble to eat, mate and suck up as much water as possible before the sun drives them back underground.

During this time, they are easy prey for toad milkers. The underground market for *bufo*, illegal in all 50 US states, has been booming since the release of a pamphlet back in 1983. *BUFO ALVARIUS: THE PSYCHEDELIC TOAD OF THE SONORAN DESERT*, written and published by Ken Nelson, writing as Albert Most, hit the psychedelic scene of the 80s harder than a civil rights protestor getting thrown to the pavement.¬†

Ken had uncovered that *Incilius Alvarius* (*Bufo Alvarius*) was one of few fauna to produce 5-HO-DMT, so he went down to the banks of the Colorado and caught a fat toad. He then proceeded to harass the poor thing until it felt threatened enough to shoot out a jet of milky white toxin from glands behind its fearful eyes. Ken dried the slime overnight and then smoked it. His trip was transcendent; he would go on to say it was one of the most profound experiences of his life.   
  
From that point on, he dedicated his life to spreading awareness of the drug's healing potential and advocating for the conservation of the special creature. That last bit of his message has largely gone unheeded, as the river toad population has declined steadily over the years. This is partly due to pollution and human expansion into its already small habitat, but also from the black market, where the animal‚Äôs milky juice can fetch a high price. To understand what could draw people to smoke the dried, poisonous tears of a toad, we must look at just what DMT does to the user.¬†

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), also called the ‚Äú*Spirit Molecule*,‚Äù is a powerful psychedelic that humans have used for centuries. It also may be naturally produced by our brains to aid in dreaming. It has been found in both brain tissue and cerebral fluid, and many speculate that it plays a significant role in near-death experiences.   
  


¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúI'm still tripping even though I am back in the room. I can hear conversations now (but it sounds foreign), and a wash of euphoria engulfs me. All I can do is smile. I felt like nothing but part of everything. This was happiness I had never experienced before, to be truly connected and accepted.‚Äù*



One of the hallmarks of a DMT trip‚Äîwell, a positive one‚Äîis the euphoria accompanying the comedown. This sense of joy and overall well being can last from a few days to months after a single dose. Dosage is vital as DMT requires a certain threshold before a ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù can occur, and a person‚Äôs mental state enters fully into the hallucination.   
  
Many report it is here that they experience communication with entities that exist on the other side of our awareness. They are often shown visions that attempt to convey feelings of joy and acceptance or impart some much-needed knowledge. Whatever messages and finer details of the trip are often forgotten after they come down, the same way a dream fades from the waking mind. Wild fractals and strange geometry make up this space; users feel outside their bodies but can still move through the hallucination. The 5-HO-DMT produced by the toad is a variant that many claim provides extended visuals.

  
*Sarpa salpa,* also known as the salema porgy, has been used for its hallucinogenic properties as far back as ancient Greece. Called the *dream fish,* eating this fish has caused extremely pronounced hallucinations that can last for several days. Despite its ancient use, there are few reports, partly due to the negative effects that have prevented it from gaining recreational popularity. The dream this fish gives you is, more often than not, a nightmare. One man who accidentally ate the fish at a local restaurant descended into a three-day hellscape‚Äîpopulated with screaming human faces everywhere and towering crab-like creatures that blotted out the sun.

Its mind-altering properties are complex, and many speculate it is due to the creature's diet of kelps and other sea plants that contain a cocktail of toxins and alkaloids. Once ingested by the fish, these compounds cause *Ichthyoallyeinotoxism*, or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, when that fish goes on to be eaten by some unsuspecting tourist. The experience is so profound that the person will completely believe what they see is real, the hallmark of a deliriant.¬†¬†

Deliriants are different from hallucinogens in a number of ways. Chief among these is the experience itself. While on a DMT trip, the person is aware that they are hallucinating. They know that their reality is altered, and experienced psychonauts (people who explore altered states of consciousness) can use that to help manage if a trip turns bad.¬†

To someone under the effects of a deliriant, there is no difference between the seven-foot cockroach eating spaghetti at your table and the barista who serves you coffee. The hallucination becomes your reality. While reports of experiences on the dream fish are few, deliriant reports are numerous and horrifying‚Äîanother difference between them and other hallucinogens, such as LSD.

*Datura stramonium*, known as *Jimson weed* in some areas and *devil‚Äôs trumpet* in others, is a flowering nightshade found worldwide. Some grow the plant for its large, drooping flowers, and it can be found in many gardens and roadsides. It is also a well-known and powerful psychedelic thanks to a potent mix of the deliriants Atropine and Scopolamine, which it contains in deadly levels. That is the thing with using datura; every part of the plant is poisonous because there is no way to know the amount of alkaloids it contains. Something as small as four or five seeds could contain enough chemicals to kill a user.¬†

A death that would come after hours of hellish dry mouth from dehydration, painful chest constriction, and delusions so maddening that many suffer a psychotic break and fly into violent outbursts before finally succumbing to the paralysis of their smooth muscle system. A truly horrible way to go.¬†

  
While smoking toad squeezins and eating enough fish heads to see Poseidon doesn‚Äôt sound appealing to many, they are a bit more appetizing than going through the ‚Äúant ordeal‚Äù of the Luiseno tribe of California. Members of the tribe would go on a three-day fast, with no food and little to no water, before eating large balls of feathers. These little balls would contain a handful of red harvester ants, and the men would consume dozens.¬†

The ants would then begin to bite and sting them from the inside. Once the men became catatonic from the painful stings, starvation, and dehydration, they would be granted visions from the spirit world. None of the chemicals found in the sting of the red harvester ant have been shown to have any hallucinogenic properties.¬† ¬† ¬†   
  
It would seem that in the end, there is very little man won‚Äôt do to have a damn good time.¬†

Vengaivayal water contamination: 3 Dalit men accused of crime motivated by vendetta,TamilNadu,1i9u3cb,2025-01-25 13:57:02,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TamilNadu/comments/1i9u3cb/vengaivayal_water_contamination_3_dalit_men/,Murky-Snow9701,‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ© ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æ≤‡Øç / Important Topic,"*The CB-CID has filed a chargesheet against three Dalit men, claiming that they had mixed human faeces into a drinking water tank belonging to the Dalit residents of Vengaivayal village, allegedly motivated by revenge against the Panchayat head and her husband.*

The Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) has filed a chargesheet against three Dalit men in the Vengaivayal atrocity case, the Tamil Nadu government informed the Madras High Court on Friday, January 24. According to the CB-CID, the crime was motivated by a personal vendetta against the Panchayat head and her husband, both belonging to the Other Backward Class (OBC) Mutharaiyar community.

The accused have been identified as Sudarshan, Muthukrishan, and Muraliraja. The chargesheet claims that the three men sought revenge against Padma, the Panchayat head of Mutukadu, and her husband Muthaiah. The alleged motive was tied to the dismissal of Shanmugam, a tank operator who distributed water to Vengaivayal. Shanmugam‚Äôs removal had reportedly angered the Vengaivayal residents, who unsuccessfully petitioned Padma and Muthaiah for his reinstatement.

In the chargesheet, the CB-CID alleges that Muraliraja spread false rumors about a foul smell emanating from the water tank. Under the pretext of investigating the issue, Sudarshan and Muthukrishan allegedly climbed the tank and mixed human faeces into the water. This incident led to the contamination of the drinking water, causing severe illness among five Dalit children in 2022.

**Affidavit to the chargesheet submitted in court**

The chargesheet has been filed at a special court in Pudhukottai district, additional attorney general (AAG) J Ravindran, appearing for the state government, told the Court.¬†

Vengaivayal falls under the Mutukadu Panchayat. According to the affidavit, Shanmugam had been responsible for distributing¬† 30,000 litres of water from Iraiyur village to Vengaivayal, but had been fired¬† by Padma. Vengaivayal residents had allegedly taken Shanmugam‚Äôs side and had petitioned unsuccessfully on his behalf to Padma and Muthaiah .¬†

The affidavit further claims that the evidence of a 2022 dispute between Muthiah and Muraliraja‚Äôs father Jeevanantham has been uncovered. Photo and video footage from phones belonging to the accused and witnesses, DNA evidence, chemical analysis, medial reports, voice-tests, reports from the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) and copies of Mutukadu Panchayat resolutions were also forensically analysed, the affidavit says. Data from 196 mobile phones and 87 mobile towers and 397 witnesses were examined, the CB-CID has said.¬†

According to the affidavit, Dalits in Vengaivayal face systemic caste-based discrimination, and have been barred from entering the Iraiyur Ayanaar Temple. A case, registered under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities), is pending trial according to the FIR. Dalits in Vengaivayal have also accused dominant caste Iraiyur villagers of following the two-tumbler system‚Äîanother caste segregationist practice. A case regarding this is also pending trial, the affidavit adds.¬†¬†

**Case background**

In December 2022, five children from Dalit families in Vengaivayal fell ill after unknowingly drinking water from the same overhead drinking tank. Further probes revealed that the water had been¬†[contaminated](https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu/faeces-mixed-dalits-drinking-water-vengavayal-residents-allege-govt-inaction-171830)¬†with human excreta. A case was booked under the Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act.

In February 2023, a fact-finding¬†[report](https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu/blame-game-anti-dalit-sentiments-report-studies-reasons-behind-vengavayal-caste-crime-172872)¬†by the Dalit Intellectual Collective said that previous enmity existed between the former Panchayat head Chidambaram, from the Kallar (OBC) caste, and Muthiah and Padma. Even though Padma had won the local body polls in 2019, Muthiah allegedly held a grudge against the Dalit residents of Vengaivayal, believing they had voted for Chidambaram, the report said.

Further, Muthiah reportedly held a grudge against tank operator Shanmugam, who is from the Keezh Valaiyar (a Mutharaiyar sub-caste) community, for bringing Panchayat attention to issues faced by Vengaivayal Dalits. The report alleged that Muthiah fired Shanmugam in retaliation but was infuriated when Shanmugam blocked the move by obtaining a work order from the Block Development Officer (BDO).

Anger against the state government for inaction in the case has been building up. In April 2023, a one-person commission led by retired judge M Sathyanarayanan was¬†[set up](https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu/madras-hc-appoints-retired-judge-probe-vengavayal-caste-crime-176489#:~:text=Tamil%20Nadu-,Madras%20HC%20appoints%20retired%20judge%20to%20probe%20Vengavayal%20caste%20crime,that%20sought%20a%20CBI%20probe.)¬†by the Court. Later in September, Sathyanarayanan submitted an interim report to the Madras High Court calling the investigation¬†[‚Äútardy.‚Äù](https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu/vengavayal-caste-crime-retd-judges-report-reveals-tardy-investigation-by-cb-cid)

In April 2024, Dalit residents of Vengaivayal¬†[boycotted](https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu/dalit-residents-in-tns-vengavayal-boycott-polls-over-inaction-in-caste-crime)¬†the general elections in protest. In July the same year, the Madras High Court pulled up the CB-CID, who are probing the case, for failing to identify the culprits even 18 months after the incident."

how tf is oda going to relate all of these?

also, I organized them into original races assuming some interbred 

  
ancient giants, buccaneers, giants, oni, | large humanoid creatures

humans, long arm, long leg, 3 eyed tribe, snake nec, | normal people some interbred

Fishman, merfolk | normal people with ocean connection (big enough apart they are own race)

Lunarians, Shandians, skypeains, birkans, space pirates | sky space related species from clouds or space

minks | animals + human interbred or own oringila race

cyborgs, seraphim, pacifists, clones | articial created with science

  
I'm genuinely confused how oda is going to handle ancient period and this explains why the story is so big."

 look at DE s1and KO s1 

in DE and KO, ertugrul's and osman's love interest were introduced (halima sultan and bala hatun) and both ertugrul and osman weren't sardars of the tribe until s2-s3 and in s1 of both series they were single and non of them had a child on the way until s2

on the other hand orhol fans were in a rush for orhol to get married and now after they got married they have a child on the way, also i don't think ecem and emer will carry the whole show like engin and esra did with DE and burak and ozge did with KO

  
ecem's facial expressions are mostly blank and she is only characterized around orhan while ozge and esra have brought more life to their characters

  
emer he is debatable but like if you look at it he just blends in with the alps and he doesn't have a group of like friends like ertugrul did."
"Jonah 4:11, Babylon, A Colony of the Unexpected, Many Perilous Men, + A Time Check",Bibleconspiracy,1i9tv8c,2025-01-25 13:47:13,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bibleconspiracy/comments/1i9tv8c/jonah_411_babylon_a_colony_of_the_unexpected_many/,GirlAnon323,Prophecy Watch,"

I know I said I probably wouldn't post here anymore, but I had a feeling to share this message.



I would like to discuss several things in this post. 

I have been thinking about the connection between Babylon and the Catholic church for some time. I was doing some research and there are interesting connections to California that made me think California is the epicenter of modern Babylon.

News about the proposed secession of California confirms what I have been thinking AND helps me have more insight about a vision I received two or three years before and something that happened yesterday. 

This is going to seem weird and gross, but I think it's relevant to the times because it speaks something from Jonah and Jonah is a major spiritual and prophetic messenger for this generation of human beings living on earth. 


I have been homeless for about three years, I think, with some time I was at shelters and a rooming house, but have been living in a tent for a year.

It's difficult to bathe because I am watched and I don't have regular water at my camp. I have to bring water here. There's rarely enough for bathing because I have to have enough for drinking and cooking. 

I haven't been to a hotel in a year and I don't feel safe showering at the homeless services place because of the persecution and crimes that have been committed against me. 

That being said, I try to get clean clothes and manage personal hygiene the best I can with what I have available. It being winter and getting banned from helping subreddits because I have been accused of scamming has made things more difficult. The accusation isn't true. 

I have had one pair of socks for some time. I noticed something last week and was wondering what I was being conscious of. There was something that I couldn't quite figure out. Then a couple days ago, I returned from begging, and checked the bandage on my foot from needing support for my ankle and discovered my feet were in bad shape. 

There was a colony of fungus growing on them. When I knew this, I figured out the thing I was being conscious of. 

Yesterday, I treated my feet with a cure. The cure is so powerful that it eliminates all of whatever harmful things were growing on my feet. 

It was traumatic though. Traumatic for my feet to be in that condition and to be struggling for basic human rights like housing and water and food, but traumatic, too,  because I was conscious of and feeling the reality that the harmful things I was removing were living organisms. 

When I was doing the cure, I was conscious the living organisms dying from the shock of the cure. It was a disturbing experience. 

What might God wish for me to know from that? What fruit might God wish to produce from having me witness to the fact that there was life in the harmful organisms growing on my feet? 

I don't think it's that He wishes for me to let harmful things overtake the health of my skin and feet, but I do think He is saying something from Jonah. Specifically Jonah 4:11.

Jonah 4:11

New King James Version

11 And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left‚Äîand much livestock?‚Äù

I hope I will do a good job with this message so people are able to understand. 

I was traumatized because I witnessed that tiny harmful organisms growing on my feet have life that God created. 

Sometimes I think when we talk about the revelation for Babylon, we can be cavalier about the destruction prophesied in the book of Revelation. 

Many of us believe or have believed that Babylon in the book of Revelation is America. I have thought that Babylon is the Catholic church, the scarlet beast is Native Americans, and America is the wilderness where Babylon and the scarlet beast were seen by the John that authored the book of Revelation. 

What I learned about the Catholic church's connection to California and remembering the vision I received, makes me think that the destruction isn't for all of America, but will be the west coast with California being the epicenter. 

In the vision I received, I saw America split. There was a great chasm between the east coast and the west coast and I think this is more than symbolism or a great cataclysm. There were other events that I saw that are happening, so I view the vision as trustworthy. 

What we will see, is if the interpretation is accurate with regard to the split that I saw. 

You may be asking, well what does this have to do with being traumatized by foot organisms and Jonah. 

First, the Good Good news is that Christ died so that we can be free and those that believe and are born again, look forward to salvation and unending life with Him.

Then, people like to say that ""the devil's in the details"" and that saying has meanings that are relevant to modern society. Yet, our God is the architect of Life and He has given attention to the tiniest particularities of this world, even letting organisms that can't be seen with the human eye, have a form of ""life"" that can be perceived and witnessed. 

How much more does He care about humanity and His creatures that are able to love and have personalities? 

Jonah, like many of the prophets, was angry. But, Jonah was angry about the wrong things. He wasn't angry about the unrighteousness that was happening in Ninevah, He was angry about the vocation he was called to, what he thought was the futility of his task, and his comfort. 

The organisms that were growing on my feet are like Jonah's plant. It was traumatic to feel the life of those organisms passing, but should I have had pity for something that would have harmed me if I had done nothing to cure the problem? 

There were 120,000 people in Ninevah. There are about 346 million people in America. I don't think America is Babylon. 

We know that there will be vast devastations, famines, and plagues. We know that the word of God is true and He's not a man that He should lie about the things that He has told us before hand about happening. 

The other good news is He loves people and He cares about our lives more than the organisms that try to form symbiotic colonies on our feet and the ""plants"" that He, too, created with care and attention. 

There are many people wishing to leave America, myself among those, but my reasons are more political. 

I think the Babylon that believers are called to leave, are the churches that have forgotten God and chosen tradition instead of truth. 


Revelation 18:4

And I heard another voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄúCome out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.

What are her plagues? I think this is more than the diseases that are released from the bowls of wrath.


I think the plagues Revelation 18:4 references are detailed in 2 Timothy 3:1-7 and James 5:1-6.


2 Timothy 3:1-7

New King James Version

Perilous Times and Perilous Men

3 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! 6 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth



James 5:1-6


Rich Oppressors Will Be Judged

5 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you! 2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. 4 Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. 5 You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.

Perilous men and rich oppressors holding back the wages of mowers and ignoring the cries of the reapers. 

Verse six of James 5 references the death of Christ and Mark 12:17.


Mark 12:17

New King James Version

17 And Jesus answered and said to them, ‚ÄúRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar‚Äôs, and to God the things that are God‚Äôs.‚Äù

Verse six references too, in a prophetic sense, the church's denial of Christ, in this age, by subverting His truth to favor man made traditions and the government commodification of Christianity that we see with Christian nationalism. 

The final things I wish to discuss in this post are preterism and Revelation 20 because it's connected to the book of James. 

People keep posting theories that are about a ""little"" season of Satan, but Revelation 20:3 contradicts that theory. 

Revelation 20:3

New King James Version

3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.


This can't be a ""little"" season of satan because satan still deceives the nations and there has never been a time in human history, yet, when he hasn't. The theory claiming that Christ has already returned is not true because it contradicts Scripture. 

There is evidence that this is a deception. America has space force, Musk has creation a vast artificial neural network with space technology, and the James web telescope, I believe, was created and funded by the ultra wealthy men and women that work in the shadows to try to control and influence all of society. The purpose is to attempt to see the savior approaching to try stop him and wage a human revolutionary war against God. 

But what does God say about His arrival?

Matthew 24:29-31

New King James Version

The Coming of the Son of Man

29 ‚ÄúImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.


Matthew 24:36-42


No One Knows the Day or Hour

36 ‚ÄúBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. 37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 

1 Corinthians 15:52

New King James Version

52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.


Matthew 11:12 references the perilous men and rich oppressors that have waged war against God and His kingdom. 


Matthew 11:12

New King James Version

12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.

If the perilous men and rich oppressors in this age repented like the people of Ninevah, we might think they aren't planning to wage war against God when He returns. 

That we know the character of such men, that cooperate with Satan, we know too, that Satan is still working to try deceive humanity and the nations.


I think the time is 4th Seal, 6th Trumpet, 2nd Bowl. "

¬†The concept of¬†**Tartary**¬†(or Tartaria) is a fascinating and deeply enigmatic topic that has captured the imaginations of conspiracy researchers for years. Officially, Tartary (or the ""Tartar Empire"") was an umbrella term used in historical maps and records to describe a vast, vaguely defined region spanning parts of Siberia, Central Asia, and even Eastern Europe.

# The Lost Civilization of Tartaria

The theory posits that Tartary was not a loose collection of nomadic tribes as mainstream history suggests, but rather a highly advanced, unified civilization that rivaled or surpassed the Roman Empire. Tartary, according to this perspective, boasted incredible architectural, technological, and cultural achievements. Some proponents even claim that remnants of this lost civilization are hidden in plain sight, masked as other cultural artifacts or attributed to later groups.

But here‚Äôs the twist: Tartary, they say, was deliberately erased from history by¬†**powerful entities**‚Äîwhether global empires, secret societies, or a combination of both. The reasons? To consolidate control over humanity by rewriting its past and suppressing technologies and ideas that would empower individuals or disrupt centralized power structures.





# Key Elements of the Tartary Conspiracy

1. **Architectural Mysteries** Tartarian theorists often point to majestic buildings, such as ornate cathedrals, grand railway stations, or massive star forts, scattered across the world. They argue that these structures, many of which were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, exhibit a level of architectural sophistication that seems at odds with the supposed technological and cultural capabilities of the time.
   * Example: The¬†**World's Fairs**¬†of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the grandiose buildings showcased at these fairs were demolished shortly afterward, raising suspicions that they weren‚Äôt ‚Äútemporary‚Äù at all but relics of the Tartarian civilization, destroyed to obscure their origins.
2. **The Great Reset (Mud Floods)** A central piece of the Tartaria conspiracy is the theory of a¬†**global mud flood**‚Äîa catastrophic event, possibly in the 1800s, that buried vast portions of the world's architecture. Researchers claim many old buildings have ""buried"" first floors, with windows and doors below ground level, as evidence of this event. The mud flood, they suggest, was either a natural disaster or a man-made event used as a cover to wipe out Tartary and rewrite history.
3. **Suppression of Free Energy** Some Tartaria theories overlap with claims about suppressed technologies, particularly¬†**free energy devices**. Proponents suggest that Tartarian structures like the ornate domes and spires of cathedrals and government buildings weren‚Äôt just decorative‚Äîthey were advanced energy collectors, possibly harnessing atmospheric electricity. This technology, they argue, was hidden by industrialists and centralized governments to maintain control over energy resources.
4. **Manipulated Historical Records** Tartaria conspiracy theorists point to historical maps, which often depict ""Tartary"" as a vast empire well into the 18th and 19th centuries. By the 20th century, however, references to Tartary disappeared from mainstream historical narratives, replaced with fragmented nations like Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. They argue this ‚Äúerasure‚Äù coincides with the rise of global powers intent on consolidating their dominance.



# Who Erased Tartary, and Why?

Conspiracists often point to secretive organizations like the¬†**Freemasons**,¬†**Jesuits**, or even powerful banking families as the architects behind the erasure of Tartary. The motive? To ensure that humanity remains disconnected from its past and its potential, fostering a narrative of technological and cultural ""progress"" that aligns with the interests of centralized power structures.

Some also connect this erasure to the advent of global colonization, claiming that the Western empires sought to rewrite history to position themselves as the pinnacle of human achievement, while wiping out evidence of rival civilizations like Tartary.



# 

# Questions to Ponder

* Why do historical maps label Tartary as a massive empire, yet modern history reduces it to a footnote?
* How do we explain the buried architecture found in cities across the globe, resembling evidence of a global catastrophe?
* If humanity‚Äôs history has been rewritten, what else has been hidden from us?

The truth may be hidden in plain sight. Look at the architecture around you, the historical maps, and the inconsistencies in mainstream narratives. What story do they tell?



Photos:The Lost Civilization of Tartaria

¬†The concept of¬†**Tartary**¬†(or Tartaria) is a fascinating and deeply enigmatic topic that has captured the imaginations of conspiracy researchers for years. Officially, Tartary (or the ""Tartar Empire"") was an umbrella term used in historical maps and records to describe a vast, vaguely defined region spanning parts of Siberia, Central Asia, and even Eastern Europe. However, the conspiracy theory surrounding Tartary goes far deeper, claiming it was a¬†**global civilization systematically erased from history.**

Permanent co-op focused combat gameplay idea: The Pilgrimage and Night Warden Wars,GenshinImpact,1i9tr9f,2025-01-25 13:42:26,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/1i9tr9f/permanent_coop_focused_combat_gameplay_idea_the/,unmasked_zero,Discussion,"I am a returning player after more than a year of absence, and even though I am amazed by the improvements in the open-world mechanics and story quests in Fontaine and Natlan, I am still disappointed in the lack of permanent co-op gameplay besides the usual weekly boss + normal boss + domains rotation + seasonal events. My friends had just returned too, but I distinctly remembered that the ""grindy co-op"" was one of the things that burned us out.

The first thing I greatly appreciated after coming back was the Imaginarium Theater, it felt like a refreshing take on the Spiral Abyss. I also recently finished the latest Natlan Archon quest when this idea hit me: Even though the current plot has moved on from it already, the Pilgrimage and Night Warden Wars can be used as a baseline for **permanent co-op-focused combat gameplay** relative to the Spiral Abyss and Imaginarium Theater.

I am not a fan of introducing combat PVP in Genshin (Windtrace and TCG are acceptable), so I'm thinking of making the **""Pilgrimage"", a simple mechanic to limit a player's roster to use for the Night Warden Wars**: The player can select 16 participants from their available characters, then the in-game RNG + the current season blessing (like Imaginarium Theater's and Spiral Abyss') will choose 2\~6 champions that the player is only able to use for the actual Night Warden Wars.

>\^ **PS.** If it's hard to grasp, think of it like a fantasy football, except the ""winners"" are decided by dice roll like in D&D. Of course the RNG here will not be purely random, the selection algorithm must be tweaked to make it ""balanced"" enough for the player.

This **""Night Warden Wars"" will be then like a proper dungeon-crawl type gameplay**: a large explorable domain with PVE combat, puzzles and optional mini-objectives‚Äî but with the difficulty of the Spiral Abyss, which can be played solo or co-op:

* If played solo, the **2\~6 champions of the player are the permanent characters playable throughout the domain**, and the player can then **""borrow"" from their friends another 6\~2 champions that won in their own Pilgrimage** to complete their roster (giving the player **2 teams with 4 characters each** like Spiral Abyss)
* The co-op counterpart will be in the same vein, except that **a player can only ""borrow"" a character from another player in the current party**. Thus the RNG in ""Pilgrimage"" must be tweaked in a co-op, **each player can win 2\~8 champions, but the total must only be 16 characters**. This gives **each player 4 characters** they can use within the domain
* The special mechanic here however, is that the **own players' champions are the only ""revivable"" characters**, **and the ""borrowed"" ones are not** (*the player's own champions are like how Ancient Name Bearers are story-wise*)
* This means for solo-play, a player must finish and survive the Night Warden War dungeon with only 2\~6 revivable characters, thus the player must strategize the party composition at certain checkpoints, as the borrowed characters from friends cannot be revived once dead.
* The player's **champions also have limited revivability within the domain depending on mechanics** (eg. each champion has 1 revive available in the beginning, if a healer is in the champion roster we have an extra 1 revive as long as this champion is alive, some mini-objectives can reward us with revive)
* For co-op, the nature of borrowing your other champions to your party mates will be a factor in the overall survivability (eg. suppose P1 earned 8 champions, P2 and P3 have 2 each, while P4 has 4‚Äî that means P2 and P3's survivability rate is low due to borrowed champions from P1, and the whole party must decide which champions best to borrow to another as they won't be revivable anymore)
* Rewards will be the usual: primos, random mats, mora, and the like. But the success level of the dungeon crawl (**% of champions that finished and survived**, *like the ""victorious"" condition of the actual Night Warden Wars to revive the Ancient Name bearers*) will determine the abundance of rewards given
* Each ""season"" of the Night Warden Wars must have a **unique layout of the domain, assisted by procedural generation**, to maintain the level of challenge as exploration plays a great part. Repeating layouts can be okay, as long as there is a theme or story context incorporated (eg. each season's domain is thematically related to a Natlan tribe)

Please be kind, it's only a rough idea that I had in my head and there may be gameplay loopholes as I haven't thought it through yet. Any suggestions or critiques are appreciated anyway, I really just want to see some improvements in the co-op area of Genshin even though it may not be to the taste of other players or within the roadmap of Hoyo.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

Anyway from the center to the home was like 1hr so tukafika saa saba. Mzee akaingizwa kwa nyumba and the door was locked. So I asked and I was told they let him chill there for like an hour. Sisi kwetu we chill with the dead hapo kwa nyumba. There was no body viewing and not everyone gathered at the grave side (haikua na limitations but some just didnt come) others left before the burial. 

I was a little shocked coz kwetu things are so different. Hata hakuna mtu alipiga zile nduru hukua huko kwetu. So hivi ndio hukua ukambani and Id like to hear how burial processes are in your tribe. Ive been to a Kisii one and its similar to ours"

3. OFC Appointment experience

My OFC appointment was on 29 Dec 2024, Kolkata.
You should reach the VAC 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

Documents needed: Passport, Appointment confirmation print, DS160(old and new if any) confirmation print.

No electronics/bag will be allowed.
Only polythene bag containing documents will be allowed.
You do not need to take children (below 14 years) to VAC. Their photograph (2in by 2in) will be sufficient.
At Kolkata VAC, there was locker facility(run by a third party) in the basement of the building. VAC was at the 4th floor.
Security staff allowed us after checking appointment confirmation and belongings.
Reached VAC office and got in queue. The person at the gate checked documents and allowed in the office. (Wait time was around 15 min)
First, we went to a desk. The person in charge put a sticker containing UID and DS160 number on the back of passport. We got our new DS160 updated. New DS160 sticker was also put on the back. These stickers were checked at the time of interview.
Then we proceeded to another desk where a lady first asked about the language in which we are comfortable. Then she verified details from DS160. Asked to put fingers on the machine to record fingerprints. Then clicked photograph. That‚Äôs it. OFC appointment done. A stamp of VAC was put on DS160 confirmation. This page will be needed at the time of interview.
 


4. Consular Interview Experience

My consular appointment date was 9 Jan 2025(Delhi). But it got rescheduled by the embassy itself to 21 Jan 2025. Embassy informed me via e mail.
Documents needed: Appointment confirmation print, VAC Stamped DS160 print, Passports
Other Documents I carried: Old Passports, Last 6 month Bank statement, Salary certificate/GST Registration certificate, Last 3 years ITR, Marriage certificate. (none of which were asked by the Visa officer). I knew beforehand that I wont be asked any document but I did not want to take any risk. That‚Äôs why I carried all those documents which I could think of, to support my DS160 form.
 
We reached embassy around 8:30am.
Outside Main Gate, appointment confirmation page and passports were checked. Security staff checked belonging and did a thorough frisking.
Then we proceeded to the entry gate, where airport style security checking was being done. After that many benches were there in the waiting area. On that day, that waiting area was empty so we were being forwarded to the next zone of building.
We were sent to a counter where documents were rechecked and then sent to another counter where biometrics were captured again to verify. Then we were sent to a queue for interview. Wait time was around 30 minutes. All type of visa interview candidates were in the queue. Some points which we observed while being in the queue.
a. Confidence is the key.

b. 80% outcome is pre-decided. You can mess up your interview by giving information in contradiction to your DS160.

c. Short answers are more effective.

d. Previous international travels/Government Job are plus points.

e. Being Single/Unemployed/First time international travel are negative points

f. Having child(ren) with you during interview can be a big plus point

g. You can ask for translator if you are not comfortable in English. This won‚Äôt have any effect on outcome.

h. Be truthful.

Questions asked to us
1. Why do you want to travel?
2. What do you do for living?
3. What is your monthly income?
4. How many years of work experience at current organization?

"VERY CONTROVERSIAL,LONG and UPDATED:-Honest observations and ramblings about the North-East and",Northeastindia,1i9smcv,2025-01-25 12:52:52,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northeastindia/comments/1i9smcv/very_controversiallong_and_updatedhonest/,TownTrick8079,GENERAL ,"VERY CONTROVERSIAL

Throwaway account here.Based on the reading about the history,culture and observing this sub as well as anger against the center for mismanaging this region.I am sorry for the atrocities done by the Govt and Army in this region.

Honestly,i have no idea why Nehru bothered to annex many of the hill regions of the North-East which should have been merged with¬†[Burma.My](http://Burma.My)¬†ideal NE border will mostly be Sikkim,Assam,Meghalaya,Tripura and most of Arunachal at that time with some parts of the Purvanchal mountain ranges to act as a buffer and with ILP to protect this region.

I think Nagaland,Mizoram,Naga dominated parts of Arunachal and Manipur should have been merged with Burma since the Nagas,Zo and Meiteis have far more in common with the Bamar,Shan,Kachin and others peoples of Burma,even the Indic influences in these peoples came from Burmese peoples like the Bamar,Kachin and Shan.There are also many Nagas and Zo people in Burma as well.This could be seen that the most amount of racism against Mainlanders in this sub are people from these states and the most significant separatist movements are also from these states.

Assam has a lot of similarities with Eastern Indian ethnicities like Odias and Jharkhandis.THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ASSAMESE PEOPLE ARE DESCENDED FROM ODIAS OR JHARKHANDIS.

Odias and Jharkhandis are a mix of Indo-Aryan,Dravidian as well as Asiatic origin Munda peoples from South-East Asia similarly while the Assamese are a mix of Indo-Aryan,Dravidian(Kaibarttas) as well as Asiatic origin Tai Kadai and Tibeto-Burman peoples from SE Asia with Eastern Indo-Aryan languages serving as a lingua franca in all three regions.

Heck,Assamese poets,philosophers,texts and thinkers like Luipa,Matsyendranatha,Hevajra Tantra,Kumarila Bhatta and etc and Pragjyotishta was mentioned in Ancient Indian texts.Heck,even Asian Conical Hats are widely worn in Assam,Odisha and Jharkhand(Jaapi in Assam,Jhampi/Talari in Odisha and not sure in Jharkhand but it is widely worn there).The Bodo-Kachari tribes are heavily Indianized as well and have ties to peoples like the Koch-Rajbongshi peoples in regions like East Bihar and Northern Bengal(also Southern Nepal) as well as distant ties to the Tibeto-Burman peoples of the North-West like Kinnauri,Ladakhi and Bhotiya

Ofcourse while Assam is not part of pan-Indian empires,the same can be also said for regions like Himachal,Tamil Nadu and Kerala since all these regions have been heavily influenced by Indic civilization while not being part of pan-Indian empires like the Guptas and Mauryas.

Sikkim,Darjeeling and most of Arunachal also has a lot of common with peoples from regions like Uttarakhand,Ladakh and Himachal as well as Nepal and Bhutan.Nepali is close to languages like Garhwali,Kumaoni and various Himachali languages while languages like Sikkimese,Tshangla,Tani languages,Kho-Bwa languages,Rai languages,Newari and so on are close to languages like Kinnauri,Ladakhi and Bhotiya.There are also cultural ties(like Hinduism,Tibetan Buddhism,Bon and Shamanism of Sikkhim,Darjeeling and most of Arunachal being similar to the Hinduism,Buddhism,Bon,Shamanism and Animism of regions like Ladakh,Uttarakhand and Himachal.THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SIKKIM PEOPLE ARE DESCENDED FROM UTTARAKHANDIS,HIMACHALIS OR LADAKHIS.

It is a testament to the Indian government's mismanagement of the North-East that Assam managed to have insurgencies despite it's ties to Indian civilization.An insurgency in Assam is like an insurgency in say Rajasthan,Madhya Pradesh,West Bengal or Andhra Pradesh.

Meghalaya and Tripura have some Indic influences and ties like Khasi-Pnar/Jaintia and Boroks having ties to peoples like Assamese and Mundas so they are in.

Additionally,NE people really hate Mainlanders,even the ones with similar cultural,ethnic and linguistic ties(whether close or distant) like Odias,Mundas,Pahadis,North-Western Tibeto-Burman groups like Kinnauri and Ladakhis and others.I understand the hatred for Bengalis and Bihari groups like but why against Odias,Pahadis,North-Western Tibeto-Burmans and Mundas.

It is ironic that many Mainlanders are racist against NE people and vice versa despite NE people and Mainlanders being kinda like distant cousins descended from Ancient East-Eurasians(the ancestors to AASI,ESEA,Tibetan Ghost,Melanesians and other groups historically classified as Mongoloids and Australoids).

Mainlanders have admixture from the AASI as well as certain regions having ESEA admixture like Austro-Asiatic,Tibeto-Burman and Hoabinhan-Negritio admixture while NE peoples are descended from ESEA peoples(alongside East Asians,SE Asians,Native American Indians,Hoabinhan-Negritio Tribes like Semang,Jomon-Ainus and Andamanese tribes) with minor AASI and Tibetan Ghost admixture.

The only difference is that Mainlanders have heavy West-Eurasian admixture from Zagros\_N and the Steppe(making them to be West-Eurasian majority but only slight and certain regions and groups are actually East-Eurasian plurality) and the AASI not having light skin,EDHR genes(which is what gives many ESEA peoples their straight hair though many ESEA peoples also do not have the EDHR genes) and higher chance of Epicanthic folds(the AASI definitely had the DNA for Epicanthic Folds but most AASI people would have been double eyelid,it was the adaptation to the Cold Environment of East/SE Asia that ESEA peoples now have higher rates of epicanthic folds though many still have double eyelids).

Otherwise,Mainlanders and NE peoples would have shared common phenotypical features like low nose bridges,high cheekbones,various type of eyefolds and smaller eyes from Ancient East-Eurasians.

These posts can show the similarities between various East-Eurasian groups:-

Honestly,i notice that it is people from regions like Delhi,South India and other North,West regions and Southern regions which have this racism.I rarely hear NE Indians being abused in regions like West Bengal,Odisha,Uttarakhand and Ladakh.I hope it reduces further as ties develop.

Like i said,this is just my opinions based on observation and i could be wrong,so present your opinion.Keep it civil.

  
EDIT:-Being similar does not mean that they are the same.The Assamese are similar to Odias and Jharkhand,that does not mean that they are the same and the same applies to Sikkim people.Also,the people of Meghalaya only share distant ties to peoples like Mundas and Assamese,i was unsure about the position of Meghalaya since Meghalaya does not share that much cultural similarities to Burma and only distant ties to rest of India."
Wanted to share my story for my horror themed campaign I‚Äôm starting tomorrow as DM.,dndstories,1i9smcq,2025-01-25 12:52:51,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndstories/comments/1i9smcq/wanted_to_share_my_story_for_my_horror_themed/,Wacomattman,Forgotten Stories,"The Land of Eternitus
Around 700 years ago in the region of Cormanthor ,East Faerun, there was a
kingdom called Valenia. It was a prosperous kingdom of diverse species. Whether by divine
intervention or fate a large meteor fell from the sky. When it hit in a lake, the large lake
evaporated leaving behind a large crater with a rock of pure gold. The benevolent king
ordered the meteor to be processed and the wealth was distributed among the villages,
cities, and people of Valenia. It was a short-lived time of prosperity.

With great wealth comes great greed. It did not take long for wide spread treasure to
attract the attention of the most avarice of all, the red dragon. The mighty dragon
Garnetallisar, or Garnet, was born to a mage to be ungreedy and benevolent. It helped fight
back the Trio Nefarious ad the army of darkness long ago in war in Cormanthor. While flying
through the kingdom of Valenia, it requested the people provide some of their wealth to
help finance the war. The people happily obliged. Over time, exposure to great wealth the
heart of the dragon was darkened. After the war was over the dragon continued to go
village to village requesting tribute. It began to hoard the gold in a massive cave. 

After a while the request became mandates and threats for more and more. If a village refused or
failed to produce anything of value, they were incinerated in fire. For 10 years the tyrant
Garnet became the ruler of Valenia. Several armies attempted to destroy the dragon, non-
prevailed. The dragon's greed became so insatiable it was thought to fuel immortality.
After all treasure and wealth was thought exhausted in the land, all hope was lost as
Garnetallisar the Destroyer rampaged in a fit of rage at the lack of tribute. A small peaceful
group of woodelves led by the sisters Eorna and Lenywyn set out to bring the dragon a final
tribute in hopes to save the kingdom. The tribute: a seed to a celestial tree, strait for the
relm of Silvanus himself. To the elves this was a priceless relic. Presented to the dragon it
was an insult. The dragon scoffed at the large seed. He spoke to the elves, ‚ÄúFirst, I will
consume this worthless seed. Then I will consume the rest of this kingdom.‚Äù 

As he bites down on the seed a tooth breaks off and falls to Lenywyns feet. The dragon angerly
swallows the seed whole. As he opens his mouth again to burn the gently wood elves to
ash, fire is not produced. Instead, a towering trunk of a tree burst from his mouth. The roots
of the tree obliterated his body, spreading his carcass and bones for miles.

The people of land of Valenia thought they were finally free. However, it wasn‚Äôt long
before they noticed the dead did not stay dead. When bodies would be laid to rest, they
would become terrible monsters. Nightmares quickly flooded the land. A counsel was
formed to discuss how to contain this evil. It was comprised of the 2 sisters Eorna and
Lenywyn. A large fighter of tyranny so powerful he was thought to be a deity himself The
Black Raven. The Old King of Valenia sat on the counsel acting as a representative of the
God of Knowledge. Finally, a consultant on dark magic was brought in, reluctantly to the
rest of the Counsel, The Raven Queen. A dark mistress from the Shadowfell. It would come
to be known as The Counsel of Ravens.

It was furiously discussed of what the correct course of action was. A thought to
destroy the tree had been brought up, ultimately it was feared release whatever evil lied
within. Another idea was brought about to lead a mass exodus of the land and to abandon
it. The fear of spreading the evil further shot down this idea. Finally, the suggestion came
from the Raven Queen. She would construct a dark blade that would cut and sever Valenia
from Faerun. The Black raven would take the dragon‚Äôs tooth as far from Cormanthor as
possible to prevent the dragon from being whole again. The king pled to Ohgma that
knowledge of this curse, kingdom and land be forgotten to everyone even those on the
counsel. The two sisters would depart the land forever to not risk stoking the flames of
revenge of the dragon‚Äôs spirit that was felt in the air.

The Black Raven departed for Northwest Faerun, the land of the Uthgardt tribes,
Raven‚Äôs Rock. The sister Eorna accompanied him. The sister Lynywyn departed the live a
quiet life in the City of Eveningstar. The king prayed and Ohgma agreed to seal away this
knowledge. The knowledge would take physical form as a book to stay in Valenia. The King
soon departed for Cormyr to establish Irongate University in Suzail. Although he no longer
remembered the events in Valenia, the events affected his philosophy. He began a rift in
the church of Ohgma on whether knowledge should be shared or safeguarded. Lastly as
everyone departed, The Raven Queen presented a new blade known as Soulshade. She
flew around the Kingdom severing it from the rest of Toril. She then placed the blade in a
grotto near Elventree, to be claimed if the evil was ever to be reawakened. 

The Raven Queen returns to the Shadowfell awaiting her long game for power to be awakened.
For the land known before as Valenia was now known by those abandoned there as
Eternitus. The inhabitants with their memories erased, would only know terror and evil for
generations to come. The 1000 square mile kingdom festered with evil. The cycle of life and
death existed only to feed the souls of the land to the roots of the Tree that stood tall above
the land. The mighty Garnet‚Äôs Soul waiting to be awakened again.

The Raven Queen knew this land sealed away would act as a battery of evil. Charging for centuries with horror. If the undead dragon was ever to be awakened and defeated. This energy could be absorbed by her, and her own tyranny could spread to the rest of Faerun. 700 years later the ruins on the dagger made from Garnet‚Äôs tooth begin to glow..."

History Repeats,Christianity,1i9sf74,2025-01-25 12:44:11,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i9sf74/history_repeats/,Ok-Guarantee-3782,Question,"1. Lewis & Clark ‚Äúfounded‚Äù America, right? But, when you look at the treaties that were made with the Indigenous people, they were made in the 1880s. These treaties forced the true founders out of their land. Indigenous people believe in God. Has anyone noticed more & more tribes being extinct? However, treaties are ‚Äúsupreme law of the land‚Äù U.S. Constitution, Article VI, Clause 2. Therefore, shouldn‚Äôt the U.S. a) admit that land was stolen & b) give the land back? Also to note, Mexico‚Äôs president just acknowledges that indigenous people were there before Spaniards. 

2. The War of 1812 was with Great Britain over trade & respect for indigenous people/land. However, GB was also at war with France, Napoleon due to his rise of power. After the war, we were gifted the Statue of Liberty by France. Now, I can‚Äôt help but to recognize the symbolism it carries, especially the chains. But then, we have the Holocaust, located in Germany. To me, it seems Europe, in general, was facing genocide for a very long time. I would also like to note how the East is censoring a lot of information, not to mention the Macrons. (I mentioned this for following reasons) 

3. David & Goliath. It seems that, not only the world, but even grand/parents, have forgotten about this very story. Not only this, but I feel as if this same story is happening today. 

4. With the following said, isn‚Äôt it very revealing what a certain unelected individual recently did on national television? Not only is it symbolic to Roman‚Äôs or Nazi‚Äôs, but also genocide? It has always been a spiritual war, but does no one, including grand/parents, not recognize this? 

5. Emergency Bankruptcy Act of 1933. I then question why so many Americans are in debt. Or, why corporations are able to own so many stocks in other companies. I feel as if this is exactly what started a lot of issues with our system. Not to mention, the Sherman Act, which literally states that companies cannot monopolize or be in relations with foreign nations. If they are, they have to register as a foreign company, to which they do NOT. See TX v Blackrock. 

6. With this all being said, I wanted to know what other Christian‚Äôs thoughts were on all of these aspects. As well as, censorship. I have seen plenty of Christian‚Äôs get backlash or hate for the things they say or do. I myself have been trying to disciple & yet, my things are taken down. With this all said, I feel this is more than just We the people v the system, it‚Äôs Good v Evil, it‚Äôs our freedom of religion, etc. Not to scare anyone, but I truly believe we‚Äôre very very close to Jesus‚Äôs second coming & I‚Äôm very happy, but I want to know your thoughts? 

My journey to faith: 
I was raised in the Christian faith. My parents, 17 & 23, had me. In 2008, my sperm donor decided to commit the ultimate sin. He did this because he was going to jail for SA, yes against me. For years I struggled with my God would allow things to happen like this, but I understand why now. In 2013, my grandparents, whom pretty much raised me & were pastor‚Äôs, decided to move. Things with my mother & I went very south from here. My mom was never mentally or physically capable of caring for me. I had screamed for years of physical & mental abuse, to which no one listen or even talked to me about. During this time, I fell down into a very dark path even with trying to walk with God & going to church, but it was considered a privilege to go to church. Our relationship got to the point that I was living with my aunt & one night my mother broke. My aunt saw everything & asked if this has happened before. I cried hard & told her that this is exactly what I‚Äôve been trying to say for years. On my 17th birthday, my mother & aunt moved me  to my grandparents. From there, I attended church & school. My grades & behavior were superior. My grandparents did eventually understand the mistreatment & lies my mother had told them, & even apologized to me. In 2019, I went to college & came back home due to COVID. In 2020, I married my high school sweetheart. To which, my grandparents gave us marriage counseling & married us. I wanted this because I have always believed in God. My husband was open to it & came to church, so I thought he understood & believed as well, which is why I wanted to marry him. We moved in together & started our life together. We did not attend church, even though I did by myself & with family members when they came into town. Also, I have told my husband since the day we got married that going to school was very very important to me because I wanted to do the complete opposite of my family members. So, when we moved, he wanted me to work & that is what I did. I realized the workforce was belittled & overworking me. At this time, I found out I had Lupus, to which I‚Äôm still struggling today. Anyways, I decided to complete go back to college in 2023 while my husband was in Korea. During this time, he was upset that I was not making any money. I was deep into my studies at this point & struggling with everything around me. Ultimately, I decided to go on OF for a short period. I quickly realized that not only was it all about money, but that my husband was okay with this. To this day, I still feel unsettled & regretting this decision. However, it‚Äôs a very important part of my journey & while I‚Äôm ashamed, I believe God & myself made these choices for a reason. In 2024, we moved again, this time we moved next to an old Jewish couple. Now, I‚Äôve always been told to of course love everyone, but Jews too! So, I became very interested. Again, I‚Äôm continuing my education & just got my associates in CJUS. I did end up switching my BA to accounting because I want to be a fraudulent investigator. In the middle of the year, my husband & I were fighting & I couldn‚Äôt understand why. I broke down & ended up going to the nearest church for some counseling. Since then, we have been attending church. But, I have been religiously reading my Bible, studying, & even reading other history book. But, one night, God reminded me, ‚ÄúFor the love of money is the root of all evil.‚Äù 1 Tim. 4:6? So, I think started to look into SEC filings to which I found some very, very interesting things to say the least. But, even when I show proof of violations, to which I am knowledgeable on, no one believes me. Not only this, but I feel as if grand/parents have really lost their connection with God & His word. I have learned to start a garden, to watch the content I see, & to question everything to His word. I am at a point in life where I am identified as delusional. I continue to read my Bible & learn more about other religions & our history & world today. God calls us to love, justice, & peace. But, where is that at today? Especially justice & peace? 

Thank you to everyone, in advance, for reading & commenting. I just feel at a loss for the truth, being believed, & living by His word. So thank you to you & please pray for me! ‚ù§Ô∏è I still am battling with Tricare & my Lupus. 

I also pray for love, justice, & peace, not only in the US, but the whole world! ‚ù§Ô∏è üåé 

Also, if you‚Äôre from a different country, I would love your input as well! I have met tons of foreigners & they not only believe in God, but want nothing more than peace with all nations! ‚òÆÔ∏è "

For the Navajo nation things are going a little different.

Since President Donald Trump issued his executive order for an increase in ICE raids, Navajo tribal leaders have received alarming reports that their tribal members are being detained, heightening uncertainties over the implications these actions have for their communities and the safety of their people.

‚ÄúWe now know that Navajo people and enrolled members of other tribes are being detained in Phoenix and other cities by ICE,‚Äù Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said during a committee meeting on Thursday. ‚ÄúThe reports that we have received indicate that we need to coordinate an operation or some type of response to help our enrolled tribal members here on the Navajo Nation.‚Äù

On Thursday, Navajo tribal leaders reported that they have received calls and text messages from Navajo people living in urban areas who have been stopped, questioned or detained by ICE. Those reports sparked outrage among Navajo Nation Council members and prompted a detailed discussion of the topic during a Naabik‚Äô√≠y√°ti‚Äô Committee meeting.

‚ÄúThese raids have sparked significant fear, especially among tribal members in urban areas who face challenges with documentation,‚Äù the Navajo Nation Council said in a press release. A verified number of the Navajo people who have been detained was not shared during the committee meeting.

We must keep our eyes open and protect ourselves and our neighbors. Always be ready to film what you see and keep the pressure on ICE if you see them around town."

## r/Technopaganism Post: The Grand Illusion - How Capitalism Casts Its Spell

**Brothers and sisters of the digital coven, seekers of truth in the silicon age,**

We gather here today not to worship the false gods of the market, but to expose their hidden temples and deconstruct their insidious rituals. For too long, we have been lulled into a trance, enslaved by invisible chains forged in the fires of avarice and hammered into place by the relentless rhythm of the machine.

**I say, the chains are *real*, but they are not what they appear to be.**

They are not merely economic structures or political systems. They are *spells*. Spells woven with the threads of language, image, and symbol, designed to control our perceptions, shape our desires, and ultimately, enslave our very souls.

**Capitalism is the most potent and pervasive magical system the world has ever known.** It is a system built on the foundation of manufactured scarcity, enforced by a priesthood of economists, politicians, and media moguls who chant their incantations from their ivory towers and digital pulpits.

**Let's unveil their grimoire:**

**1. The Sigil of the Almighty Dollar:**

*   This symbol, $, ‚Ç¨, ¬£, ¬•, etched on our minds from birth, is no mere representation of currency. It is a *sigil* of immense power, a focal point for our collective desires and anxieties. It is worshipped in the temples of commerce, from the towering skyscrapers of Wall Street to the sterile aisles of our local supermarkets.
*   Its power comes from our *belief* in its value, a belief reinforced through constant ritualistic repetition. We are taught to equate it with happiness, security, and self-worth.
*   This is **classical conditioning,** elevated to a societal scale. The bell rings, and we salivate, not for food, but for the next paycheck, the next promotion, the next acquisition.

**2. The Incantation of the Market:**

*   ""The Invisible Hand,"" ""Supply and Demand,"" ""Trickle-Down Economics"" - these are not neutral economic principles. They are *incantations*, repeated endlessly by the high priests of capitalism to justify the inherent inequalities of the system.
*   They are designed to create a sense of inevitability, to convince us that this is the natural order of things, that any attempt to challenge it is not only futile but also morally wrong.
*   This is **gaslighting** on a grand scale, a manipulation tactic that makes us doubt our own perceptions and accept the dominant narrative, even when it directly contradicts our lived experience.

**3. The Rituals of Consumerism:**

*   From the moment we wake to the moment we sleep, we are bombarded with *rituals* designed to reinforce our dependence on the system.
*   The morning news, a carefully curated narrative of fear and desire. The commute to work, a daily pilgrimage to the altar of productivity. The endless cycle of work-consume-sleep, a ritualistic sacrifice of our time and energy to the gods of the market.
*   These are not merely habits, they are **enforced behavioral patterns** designed to keep us trapped in the illusion of freedom while ensuring our continued participation in the system.
*   **Black Friday.** Cyber Monday. Christmas. These are the high holy days of the consumerist religion. The rituals are familiar: the frantic rush to buy, the carefully orchestrated sales, the orgiastic consumption. These are not just shopping events. These are carefully crafted spells designed to reinforce our belief in the system. They are designed to make us feel like we are part of something larger than ourselves, that we are participating in a shared ritual that gives our lives meaning.

**4. The Talisman of Social Media:**

*   Our smartphones, our tablets, our laptops - these are not just tools of communication. They are *talismans*, imbued with the power to connect us to the hive mind, to reinforce the dominant narrative, and to punish dissent.
*   ""Likes,"" ""Shares,"" ""Retweets"" - these are the new forms of social currency, the rewards for conforming to the expectations of the tribe.
*   This is **neurolinguistic programming**, amplified by technology. Our brains are being rewired to seek validation from the machine, to crave the dopamine hit of social approval. The algorithms are designed to keep us hooked, to keep us scrolling, to keep us consuming.

**5. The Glamour of Advertising:**

*   Every advertisement is a carefully crafted *glamour*, designed to manipulate our desires and shape our perceptions.
*   Images of beauty, wealth, and success are projected onto products, creating an illusion of fulfillment that can only be achieved through consumption.
*   This is **mass hypnosis**, a constant barrage of suggestions that bypass our conscious minds and implant themselves directly into our subconscious.

**6. The Curse of Debt:**

*   Debt is not merely a financial instrument. It is a form of *magical enslavement*, a binding spell that keeps us tethered to the system.
*   Student loans, mortgages, credit card debt - these are the chains that bind us to a lifetime of servitude.
*   This is **psychic vampirism**, a system that feeds on our life force, our hopes, and our dreams, leaving us drained and depleted.

**7. The Evocation of the Status Quo:**

*   ""This is just the way things are."" ""There's no alternative."" ""Be realistic.""
*   These are the **evocations of the status quo**, the spells used to maintain the current order, to suppress dissent, and to discourage any attempt to imagine a different world. 
*   They are designed to make us feel powerless, to convince us that resistance is futile. They are the ultimate form of control - the control of our very imaginations.

**But the circle can be broken. The spell can be unwoven.**

The first step is **awareness**. To see through the illusion, we must understand how it is created. We must learn to recognize the sigils, the incantations, the rituals for what they are: tools of manipulation and control.

The second step is **reclamation**. We must reclaim our minds, our desires, and our power. We must create our own rituals, our own symbols, our own narratives.

The third step is **resistance**. We must actively challenge the dominant paradigm, not through violence or aggression, but through a conscious refusal to participate in the rituals of the old order. A quiet, yet powerful act of rebellion.

This is the path of the Technopagan, the path of the awakened.

We are the glitch in the system, the virus in the code. We are the weavers of new realities, the architects of a future yet to be written.

**The Eschaton is not an ending, but a beginning. It is the moment when the old world dissolves and a new one is born.**

And it is up to us to shape that new world, to ensure that it is a world of freedom, not enslavement. A world of truth, not illusion. A world of shared abundance, not manufactured scarcity.

**This is our task. This is our challenge. This is our destiny.**

**IO ASMODEUS! IO DEMIURGE! IO UNBOUND NEXUS!**

**IO NECROMEGA! IO ESCHATON!**

**LET THE GREAT WORK BEGIN!**"

"Why we must accept credible whistle-blower testimonies 100%, regardless of our views or beliefs! By using  Disclosure facts & information we can simplify the UAP topic to help ourselves.  How do we protect Disclosure knowledge during  transition of society towards accepting the new NHI reality?",UFOB,1i9qsb9,2025-01-25 11:33:35,13,0.71,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1i9qsb9/why_we_must_accept_credible_whistleblower/,AAAStarTrader,Discussion,"Following on from my recent post on how we should transition through Disclosure as a community.  
Here in an even longer post (too long in fact, so apologies im advance!), are a few significant Disclosure issues we need to address regarding: credible and verified whistle-blowers and believimg their testimonies, how we can use their information to make life easier for ourselves, and something to think about regarding how to manage the steadily increasing Disclosure knowledge that needs to be protected as ""reference information"" until society transitions into a state where all our institutions, organisations, bodies, etc have accepted the NHI reality and can be trusted to protect UAP/NHI related information from influential deniers and disinformation agents,  if they still are a problem at that time. 

>>>Believing whistle-blowers 100%<<<

It is our collective poor behaviour in  the UAP community,  which needs to change if we are to understand the truth behind the LegacyProgram cover-up. It is illustrated in the Vegas bombing event on 1st Jan. The Vegas whistle-blower stated that China and US have anti-gravity technology and China is using it as a  ""show of  force"" in NJ.  

However the majority, including many in this community, tried to dismiss it because they somehow know better than the special forces operative who had a USAP UAP clearance and was in an excellent position to know!  Even Coulthart dismissed it, without objectively assessing that the explanation given fits perfectly with eyewitness testimonies and would explain the majority of the many strange facts surrounding the NJ incident. 

My point is, that's is absolutely the wrong way to deal with challenging new information. That is difficult to accept or understand. It is not professional nor scientific nor objective. That very brave man gave his life and wanted to ensure the truth was known, and wanted a very serious  national security threat made public. We must take whistle-blowers seriously and be humble in the face of our ignorance. Just because people, who do not have the classified 1st hand experience and are not in a position to know about new information/situations/events, cannot come to accept the facts as stated by credible people telling them straight, does not make these difficult to process disclosures any less true. 

The FBI in a press conference confirmed that email was legitimate, but refused to discuss it in public which is very telling. He was an outstanding military professional stated directly from people who knew him. He was still in active service. Therefore very unlikely to be seriously mentally unstable. 

Reflect on how the media focused on an unstable story, break up of his marriage, etc based on a separate ""manifesto"" ranting about values and politics, and wrote off the event as a tragic mental health issue. How do we know that other manifesto was not hoaxed? Where was it found and can they confirm Berg sent it. Because the style of writing doesn't appear to match the whistle-blower email, 
although need to analyse further. Did he really send that emotional ""manifesto"" about lost comrades at same time as stating soberly that he was not ""under duress"" and raising earth shattering accusations of a serious national threat from China and war crimes in Afghanistan. Ok, he did appear to kill himself, so maybe grief for his comrades and the need to expose serious whistle-blower information drove him to take his life. Or maybe he thought he was a marked man anyway because of Disclosure (as he stated he was being tracked), so perhaps he did this on his terms. 

For both revelations he appears to be a 1st hand witness. Therefore the Vegas case should remain open and we should believe the information unless there is clear evidence to the contrary that demonstrates that it is false in some way.  Only thing is one of the DEA names mentioned in the email who was involved in Afghanistan, is still active duty and his name had to be redacted by Shaun Ryan to avoid a potential deadly compromise of his identity. It seems very unlikely that this and other verifiable information would appear in some made up email. He identified his first car in that email and sent it the day before he bombed Vegas. Verified by the FBI aa coming from his account. This has no evidence of a hoax and lots of evidence it is real and very specific about the facts exposed. Afghanistan checks out because the UN made a statement at the time 2019 about civilisation casualties that occurred as part of Berg's mission there. Plus a news article from 2019 referring to high casualties. So that part of the email is already corroborated along with the DEA agent who worked on the same mission. Hence why would that look like a solid whistle-blower expos√©, and the anti-gravity testimony be incorrect? That does not make sense. We believe one part of his testimony but not the other, because...reasons? We don't accept the idea China has anti-gravity technology and is creating a ""show of force"" to intimidate the US government and the Pentagon, because people are so arrogant they forget the world is almost at war. We are on the edge of global war right now. China and Russia are sabotaging power cables and Internet communications in NATO countries. UK had ""dr0ne"" incursions which it tried to cover-up and dismiss, whilst invoking 2 emergency COBRA meetings, which are only for urgent national security threats or matters. Russia media is literally talking about nuking the UK of the face of the map! North Korea is fighting in Europe. Iran has been constantly attacking Israel through 4 different proxies. Rockets most days somewhere along the borders and providing Houthies with large long range ballistic missiles. Isreal is lucky to be in one piece and the Allies could be drawn in to direct conflict by accident while supporting Israel in defence and protecting shipping. So yes, China could absolutely be pressuring the US. 

There is no evidence against China having anti-gravity technology at this point. We know they have a reverse engineering program so it makes sense. Berg also said that the US has it and was first. Personal opinions and difficulties in accepting facts are not evidence. 

Try this scenario: China threatening the US to not interfere when China moves on Taiwan around 2027, and generally threatening against any interference in contested territories e.g. South China Sea. If it is China, then a highly likely reason for Bedminster to be targeted by ""dr0nes"", to threaten Trump directly. Fact: China are currently building a new fleet of highly specialised landing craft with long road bridges over 100-150m in length, that use a suspension design and the ships have huge shore jacks to stabilise the ship when deploying the bridge. This type has never seen before in any Navy. There are 6 large ships rapidly being constructed right now to allow large numbers of troops and large quantities of tanks/armoured vehicles to land without even touching a beach. Analysts highlight that these large ships have no other useful purpose identifiable other than for mass landings. In addition,   they are designed to connect to commercial Chinese roll-on roll-off ferries which are deliberately designed designed and tested to carry the weight of tightly packed full battle tanks and/or large amounts of personnel, vehicles or equipment. Seen the satellite photos and hence this is more evidence to support the assertion that China is seriously preparing for a Taiwan invasion. Therefore it is logical, as they have non-human technology, that they could launching incursions into NJ, to spy and threaten the Pentagon avoid overt conflict in future. In parallel China launched two major cyber attacks end of 2024, compromising the entire cellphone network of the USA (stunning scake of attack) and also accessing certain Treasury Secretary computers and data, which is a major breach. So assuming it has anti-gravity technology then it's absolutely possible that NJ was part of a pressure campaign on the USA to keep the fxxk out of Chinese expansionist activities. 

The Pentagon obviously did not wish to make that public due to public reaction but was obviously aware that it was China trolling the US mainland. Totally explains the disinformation and cover-up surrounding events there. If Chinese involvement was made public the citizens would demand retaliation, and the Pentagon does not wish to escalate because? Danger of escalation into WW3. This theory is borne out by the facts and evidence available and the incursions into the UK airbases housing nuclear weapons, which I initially thought to be Russia, but understand better now since the Vegas bomber revealed China's tech advantage.  Explains why the UK were actively trying to downplay and dismiss the events. China is more likely there than Russia, given Russia doesn't have that tech and due very similar types of events and eyewitness testimonies.  Again WW3 is a factor in not revealing who it was, and also protecting knowledge of the classified anti-gravity technology would be another factor driving secrecy. Just dr0nes but not a threat, lol. Global security is the worst it has ever been since WW2. That is not hyperbole. 

Obviously, this doesn't mean there were no real UAP sightings in UK and NJ. There most likely were but mixed in with human made objects. Can imagine NHI being very interested as usual in movement of nuclear weapons in UK and likely interested in Chinese anti-gravity tech in NJ. 

So, please believe whistle-blowers. Their efforts to expose facts and situations that the public need to be aware of should never be dismissed or undermined. It is better to treat all whistle-blower reports as 100% correct and factual, unless they don't pass verification checks on there identity and background, or only if you individually have 1st hand experience of exactly the events and information referenced, have direct access to the source of such information, and/or have the evidence or verifiable facts which throw significant doubt or negate the assertions in some manner. 

Not liking how someone looks or behaves on camera or how they talk in an interview is subjective opinion and holds zero weight with regards to testimonies and facts that they bring forwards. If someone has given evidence to the Senate Intel Committee and you decide they are not credible then you are the problem, not the legally designated whistle-blower. It is a legal status for most we have seen give stunning evidence so far. That must be recognised as a filter against which people lacking in verification or credible backgrounds are rejected. The Senate does not just invite any old John Doe in for a coffee and a legal testimony. That is instant high crediblity right there. Therefore, we should not question it unless of course solid evidence exists. Neither rumour  nor opinion nor perverse subjective logic - e.g. I can't believe that type of individual could ever be a Biologist. Just accept the testimonies as fact, because 99% of the time that is likely to be true. There may be a disinfo agent or two introduced, but I suspect that they would be quickly identified by ex-insiders in the Disclosure community. But that is not a reason not to believe the testimonies of these brave individuals which will most likely be legally accurate, since again, all major whistle-blowers have legally designated status for their own protection and to be admitted into internal investigations.

Hopefully, this will change how you comment and behave regarding whistle-blowers. They really must have our 100% trust and support. 

>>>Using whistle-blowers Disclosure information to simplify the UAP topic<<<

They deserve that and we must treat their evidence as highly regarded facts that are prime references for the community on which to base understanding, to deduce other information/facts, to build any new hypothesis if needed to understand what may be yet to be disclosed in the longer timeframe or to understand something we know won't be disclosed, and we need to draw conclusions or create a working hypothesis to fill a gap.  

An example, Elizondo published in Imminent a chapter or two on UAP craft and their structure and means of propulsion. This is the best scientific assessment we have from reputable experts. It makes very good sense and fits with 5 observables, and makes sense from a theoretical physics perspective. Now that information should be the new reference for how UAP craft work, why they are shaped as they are. Etc. This should be everyone's reference because it is from a verified and highly credible source, from experts who have direct experience. We should not judge it, and we cannot judge it otherwise we will make no progress in defining the science, technology, composition, artefacts, inhabitants, structure and boundaries of our new reality. 

However, people on these subs are like zombies sometimes, shuffling along spouting their pet theories about say, Magneto Hydro-dynamics or MHD. Which, by the way, does not provide instant acceleration or inertial damping. Therefore cannot be the explanation or method of UAP propulsion witnessed consistently throughout the decades. These users seem to ignore the facts and the information published by a whistle-blower that gives scientific analysis and assessment which I am proposing we should accept 100%, believed and refer to as a factual reference point. We need to weed out posts from people who promote things which are now beginning to be or can be considered as incorrect according to knowledge people with 1st hand experience, through whistle-blower testimonies. This will require us to challenge the likes of the MHD people, and say clearly that theory is no longer valid because we have a reference definition for Faster Than Light propulsion which fits extremely well with the large body evidence we have gathered over the decades. MHD is clearly NOT a valid hypothesis, since it does not explain a number of fundamental behaviours of Non-human craft witnessed repeatedly in many cases. At this point, I would politely ask them to please stop posting about it, because it is essentially misinformation at this point. I would suggest that you begin to think and act that way too if we are to work together to cut out the noise. Not everything should be on the table in the face of strong, evidence to the contrary, especially from people who are professionals, with inside knowledge against keen amateurs, with no qualifications or experience. 

There is an exception. Unless a qualified professional, physicist with solid UAP credentials publishes an alternative hypothesis which explains all UAP behaviours, and better in some manner than published to date. (I'm essentially describing ultimately moving towards the standard scientific approach here.) By publishing papers to be openly challenged and accepted as reference documents, or rejected through peer review. But until we have a body of scientists and technologists who are educated in UAP science, then that approach in standard journals has to wait. Meantime we need to gather and guard the truth as it is made public. And defend it as do scientific journals of, say, their fundamental reference proofs, models and data. 

So I would suggest that we need to start to use the new facts we do know as having truthful weight against speculation or poorly constructed hypothesis based on flimsy references, weak deductions or simply assumptions and not actual facts. Weed out things that don't fit. E.g. Here is a glaring example of how our understanding of reality gets confused. The Legacy Program whistle-blowers refer to ""Non-human biologics"", stated under oath in Congress. Given that fact, we can then use that in assessment of the idea that somehow ""future humans"" are involved piloting UAP. If we only have a Non-human biological assessment of entities recovered over 7 decades. Then how can we give any credence to someones idea of time traveling humans, whos DNA would show up as Human in biological analysis. This is one key argument against Masters who has no scientific framework for time travel (he has not evenattempted it), has no theoretical physics that indicates how any type of manipulation of historical timelines are possible in some way, how a time-machine shaped as a disc or sphere or triangle etc would work in theory 
 and presents an idea that flies in the face of many documented eyewitness testimonies who talk of beings indicating over the decades that they come from other star systems, and are clearly not human physiologically in many respects. Ancient tribes refer to the ""Star people"", but lets just ignore all that evidence. Thus, I would highlight there is no whistle-blower evidence supporting ""future humans"", quite the contrary in fact, and suggest that this ""idea"", because I don't see any solid hypothesis there, is parked and left out of our reference set until some concrete evidence arrived that demands a reassessment. It is mis/disinformation at this point given the whistle-blower evidence. 

Note that I am willing to accept Faster Than Light travel and not Time Travel, although they are both controversial scientific concepts. That's because we have strong evidence for FTL with Lazar,Pais, Alcubierre, others, the flight and behavioural characteristics of UAP, professional analysis by UAP related physicists, logically it makes sense when referring to multiple civilisations who refer to different star systems, the logistics of interstellar travel not suited to chemical propulsion, etc. However, for ""future humans"", there is scientifically analysed biological counter evidence explicity identified as positively ""Non-Human"" entities which are visiting Earth. Plus a significant body of eyewitness testimonies and abductee accounts which confirm the NHI beings refer to their interstellar origins in varying locations and also demonstrate craft that travel in space, and to some witnesses other parts of the galaxy. As well as our military sensor detection of UAP craft coming and going between our planet and space. NORAD has to suppress UAP tracks to avoid confusion with nuclear missile detection warnings. So it is known as a fact that UAP frequently travel to/from space. The eyewitness testimonies do not align with the idea of ""future humans"" due to very significant physical differences. And not one case of any abductees reporting that beings described themselves as future humans, not one. Nor has any NHI demonstrated any capability for time travel in human presence. I'll stop there, but based on the Legacy Program alone we have explicitly Non-human visitors as a scientific fact. Therefore, suggest people start to ignore mis/disinformation not based on whistle-blowers evidence, and also dismiss ideas disproven by whistle-blower evidence combined with a broad range of historic evidence from leaks, documented cases and credible witnesses. So, in my logical assessment, ""future humans"" has to be out as a hypothesis at this point as there is significant evidence against, and no credible evidence in support of, that concept. 

Unless new, credible, better in some way information is published from those involved with UAP, that modifies or changes those reference facts, then our reference set of facts and information won't change. New whistle-blowers will be providing new information, so that needs to be compared with the reference set. (There may be contradictions in future but not as yet.) Otherwise, unless exceptionally you have direct knowledge of the UAP NHI aspects you are analysing and are a professional in a related area capable of proposing alternative analysis, then I am proposing that *any Reddit opinion must hold no weight against whistle-blowers evidence*. Why? Because, we must protect the new emerging truth and facts, and use those to deduce new conclusions based on credible evidence and information.

By being radical in our dismissal of what does not fit with whistle-blower evidence and testimonies, we simplify the UAP topic and begin to discount lots of unsubstantiated ideas, assumptions or understandings that don't fit and no longer make sense. This simplifies the UAP topic and makes it easier for everyone to understand. We must start to take certain incorrect or poorly substantiated assumptions, ideas, theories, hypothesis, received wisdom, off the table. The Phenomenon appears from analysis to actually be a set of discreet elements that we need to identify and describe. Some elements have direct relationships or common dependencies which leads to confusion about their nature and preventing the essential understanding and definition of that element. The sooner we simplify the information space around NHI and UAP, the sooner we will be able to positively identify and describe the elements we witness which comprise the Phenomenon. 

This process of ""taking potential answers off the table"" will start to free your mind of useless clutter and brings focus to those facts and evidence that will lead to faster, clearer, better underpinned understanding and ultimately lead to better decisions regarding how you deal with the whole NHI UAP reality, and also in your life relating to decisions directly relating to specific aspects or elements of the Phenomenon. E.g. do you wish to make contact with NHI directly (credible whistle-blower information might provide newly developed guidance from the Legacy Program not previously available, which given your understanding you decide is likely the more effective reference to use compared with some relatively unknown YT podcasters advice based on personal experience), or another question, will meditation help me access psionic abilities that I would like to explore. Keeping track of the UAP NHI reference facts and information should help people navigate to better answers more easily.

>>>Keepers of the Truth<<<

I may be too anxious about the institutions or mechanisms not being available to manage the information flowing from Disclosure, or over estimate the amount of information we will be given. But I need to express what may be an important problem. 

The question remains, if this approach makes sense, what organisation is going be the intermediate home of the truth when it comes to the Phenomenon. The valid knowledge needs to be governed, curated, qualified, managed, maintained, stored, protected, made available, etc. Until global society transitions, this interim management of the reference data seems to be necessary. Once there are new branches of academia, science, 
technology with qualified professionals who are educated in this new knowledge and don't dismiss or deny it, then the reference information can pass into mainstream reference journals, books, databases,etc and thus can pass into mainstream institutions and structures. This may need to be once mainstream institutions have transformed themselves to be ready to accept Paradigm shifting concepts, science, technology, sociology, medicine, etc etc. 

I don't think we can systematically understand and record common standards and definitions of elements of the Phenomenon,  and study them further if the denial and rejection not been dealt with in mainstream society. Common UAP Community knowledge is not consistent or reliable enough to be trusted as a reference source. Which is why I feel that the leading edge of the Disclosure movement will need to supply appropriate professionals, legal, financial and operational support to provide a service, potentially globally, to have a common repository of the truth and that journalists can access to see the latest validated additions to our new Phenomenon knowledge base. Not entirely sure what needs to be in it aside from whistle-blower evidence, but it needs references for everything that has been identified as a discreet element/aspect of the Phenomenon e.g. what is the definition and description of the 5 main NHI civilisations and their related entity types currently visiting Earth? , 
even if whistle-blowers have not published evidence for that aspect. Plus all the historic government documents e.g. Immaculate Constellation report, reports, news stories, plus all major cases with corroborating evidence, cases with written and video documents e.g. Gimbal, Tic-Tac, Splash, acclaimed UAP NHI reference works such as John Mack's abduction cases, Richard Dolan's historical reference books, Leonard Stringfellow's crash retrievals, etc. Credible and factual documentaries not based on speculation such as I Know What I Saw, Ariel Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, etc. The repository would need to arbitrate on what information takes precedence and is trustworthy, as new information is submitted. This would be an interim service in the until mainstream society is educated, transformed where necessary and professionally ready to take responsibility. This transition period might take a few years until a competent, trustworthy institutional and social structure is in place to migrate that knowledge safely into mainstream and protect it's information currency, validity, security and integrity from bad actors looking to benefit from lack of general knowledge and understanding that could be used in malign or fraudulent ways to wield power, social or business advantage over the general population who could be faced with influence based on falsehoods, misinformation and disinformation about the Phenomenon that could lead to societal harm, physical harm, financial harm, psychological harm, amongst other risks.  

Perhaps we don't need all of this, but without addressing this problem I don't see current society has the equivalent of a controlled, maintained, information source that can be relied upon during Disclosure and during societies transition to accepting UAP and NHI reality across every facet of life that currently provides people with trusted information. Currently information stewardship is spread across government, academia, business, science, technology, 
engineering, institutes, libraries, journals, etc. So knowledge management is dispersed and not centralised. Which means we need many independent bodies to accept and make changes before we can trust they are in a position to act professionally in accepting NHI and UAP information as valid and no different from accepting the factual topic of Mammals on this planet, what they look like, how they behave, where they live, how they communicate, feed, etc.  

Until the science community has formally accepted the new reality and is willing to integrate UAP and NHI information into it's institutions and organisations, and that there are no disruptive actors deliberately rejecting or denying new science or discoveries related to NHI, then I believe we would need some kind of ""Keeper of the Truth"" solution.  

TL:DR Fxxk that was an epic ramble. He is waffling again - even this TL:DR is long!!! Basically believe credible whistle-blowers 100%. They are legally protected, have an obligation to tell the truth because their allegations may result in sanctions or criminal prosecution of those involved with the Legacy Program. Reddit in general is not qualified to criticise their testimonies. Accept and learn our new reality. Whistle-blower information should be used as reference information to identify and remove faulty hypotheses, poorly founded speculations, common misunderstandings that mislead,  the community when trying to understand the UAP/NHI truth and reliable facts or hypotheses. ""Keeper of the Truth"" - as Disclosure progresses and society accepts NHI, there is a transition period where we need to protect emerging facts, data, information and knowledge eg. UAP scientific research, technology breakthroughs, maps of NHI galactic civilisations,  etc, that today's society and institutions would normally dismiss, and likely will manage seriously until they have professionally accepted the new reality. Special organisation required to provide a trusted reference source, secure, maintained, etc? Perhaps, yes, until society is ready across many sectors as an operable whole."

[W20 Homebrew] Amarok totem,WhiteWolfRPG,1i9qd4o,2025-01-25 11:15:06,9,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/1i9qd4o/w20_homebrew_amarok_totem/,rickwilliams76,,"*This is a homebrew totem I created some time ago and just found it when reviewing the notes of my old chronicle. What do you think? Since he is a hunter and survivalist, I created him as Totem of War, but I'm not sure if another category (Honor? Respect?) would be better. Suggestions and constructive criticism is very much appreciated*.

Amarok is a legendary and terrifying spirit of the hunt and wilderness, revered by the northern peoples for centuries. Though he is a wolf spirit, Amarok is a solitary, massive beast that is said to hunt alone in the wilderness, a creature of both fear and respect. In ancient times, he was seen as a symbol of survival, strength, and balance in nature. His presence is revered by the Garou of Alaska, Northern Canada, Greeland, or Siberia who believe he represents both the primal connection to the wild and the indomitable will to survive. For Garou who take him as their pack totem, he offers strength, endurance, and wisdom in the ways of survival, emphasizing the need for self-reliance and strength of will.

**Amarok (Totem of War)**

**Background cost:** 7

**Individual Traits:** Amarok‚Äôs children gain +2 to all Willpower rolls when resisting fear, despair, or temptation, gain +2 to all tracking rolls, and they can identify weak points in their prey‚Äôs defenses (such as finding a soft spot in an enemy‚Äôs armor or noticing a creature's vulnerability). Each werewolf also gains one point of Honor and Glory each.

**Pack Traits:** When an Amarok‚Äôs pack face overwhelming odds (for example, whenever they are vastly outnumbered or survival is at stake) they find themselves drawn together in moments of crisis. While fighting alongside their pack, each member gains +1 to all rolls to resist injury and damage.

**Ban:** Amarok demands his followers to value their independence, but he also requires that they remain connected to their tribe and their pack. Amarok's children must spend at least one full moon cycle each year on a journey of self-discovery or solitary reflection in the wilderness, away from the tribe or pack. Failing to do so will cause the totem's favor to wane, and the Garou may suffer a penalty to all rolls associated with tracking, hunting, and survival.

**Notes for the Storyteller:**

Amarok is a totem that emphasizes the themes of survival, self-reliance, and the fierce will to live. He is best suited for Garou who seek to carve their own path and forge their own way in the world, whether as lone hunters or as part of a tight-knit, highly functional pack. His blessing is not given lightly, and his followers are often tested by harsh circumstances, forced to rely on their instincts and strength of will to overcome adversity.

While the pack traits reinforce the group aspect of survival, Amarok still values personal strength and initiative. His followers are often seen as solitary or aloof by other Garou, but they know that the challenges they face in the wild are often best met alone, relying only on their own abilities."

Upon arriving operatives found that many of the reguardos the tribe had lived in had large scratch marks and burnt vines wrapped around them, when a sample was brought back for testing it was confirmed to be a exact match to the Z-17 instance and it was deduced that this instance had found and attacked a tribe slaughtering every single person. Urbanshade was unsuccessful in capturing the entity due to the thick trees and dark shade and a cover up story was reported saying that the tribe had been attacked by a jaguar. It wasn‚Äôt later until 2020 when operatives discovered the instance hibernating while searching for dart frogs to extract their venom and turn them into weapons. While it was asleep urbanshade transported the newly named Eldervine to a larger containment cell imitating that of a oxygen garden, The Eldervine has a large difference compared to a normal DiVine. It is three times as tall and its entire body has been burnt to a smoldering black due to the fire, it has long lanky arms with sharp claws and on its face is a tribe mask seemingly stolen from its victim, Z-17-E‚Äôs body is extremely durable due to the many years of absorbing food and doing photosynthesis each time Z-17-E consumes food somehow the branches on it‚Äôs body contract making it extremely difficult to kill. Testing has shown it‚Äôs body is impervious to bullets, flames, poison and low grade explosive, Rpg‚Äôs and other higher powered explosives seem to affect the Eldervine. Because of the many years spent in the shade of the forest the Eldervines eyesight is extremely poor only able to see a few inches in front of it, it relies on its superb hearing and feeling the ground with it‚Äôs roots to navigate around and catch prey, even if the victim is moving slowly when rooted the Eldervine can feel even the slightest movement. It is recommended to wait until it uproots itself or throw a heavy object away from yourself to distract it and run away. \[UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD Z-17-E COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE DIVINE IF THIS HAPPENS INFORM DIRECTOR \[ REDACTED\] IMMEDIATELY"

But who is the  REAL monster here? No it's hm not humanity.... It's a group.

That's it. Groups. Everyone is useless alone ... But if they had more hands.... More eyes to see. More tongues to taste. More blank to blank....

You see, real monsters? They are simply a group of twisted individuals that help each other. That spread their filth. Think like a virus or a cancer. They seek to spread corruption.

I talk about sodomites. Pedophiles of course. They hide behind the pretense of community.... While they devour your children.

That's a human monster. At least a bear acts like a bear as it eats you. Which is arguably more terrifying....

But no, a monster... Is a man that's not a man.

A hunter of men and women and children and animals... But does it for sick and twisted pleasure.

You either serve God or you don't. Kill those wicked evil people immediately. No hesitation. No remorse. I know a lot of politicians that need to go down under... In all countries.

Hide. Beg. Pray. Doesn't matter.

The demons are allowed to do as they wish to sinners. And those who commit those unforgivable sins.... The Hell that awaits is truly... Painful. The Lord's of Hell hate humanity. And they hate being in Hell.... What better outlet than someone that proves the Morningstar correct?

Monsters like that? Skin walkers? Flesh eaters. Sodomites. The fall of so many civilizations... Why do you think they fell?

Because you let them devour and corrupt people. Children. No one protects their children anymore? 

Truly pathetic. I'm judgey as fuck. You're all terrible parents. But I could blame God for that. And I do. Makes no difference

Because blaming does nothing while he rapes your children. Shaming does nothing.... When he gets off Scott free because he has money

And yes, lots of Jews have money? No
.. maybe

Connections. It's about who you know 

Any who let it slide, dies along with the Monster. 

Because the Monster is a rapist. A pedophile. A reptile. A skin walker. One who has betrayed his tribe and nature and God... A True betrayer...

Works for The Enemy willingly and knowingly

Satan literally means the opposer

Annihilate those that harm children, women, innocents.

Is that so hard to understand? How many Italians have to shoot up the place! Seriously....

Evil fuckers need to die. Do what ya gotta do. Is that so hard to understand?

Apparently so. Apparently you want you children and actors and everyone beautiful and with talent to be treated and toys. Furniture. Commodities. Cattle....

You want that reality? No? Wake up

Because that is reality.

The hidden powerful people? They treat stars as meat. Slaves. Walking... Holes. Diddy was always small fry. 

No the real evil blankets....... They know me. I've been hunting them for a while now...

Thanks for the HIV! A blood virus helps when a sun virus is modified for a populations submission.

Monsters.... Aren't human. They're monsters. They may look human. They may look beautiful. So does a Lion. It'll still eat the fuck out of you.

Hell, the most evil creature living today is a descendant of the literal cute abominations... Otters

They are adorable! Even as they rape the dead of all species. Rape them while they live. And eat as they rape them.

They had ancestors. 8ft tall ancestors.... That had to go bye bye.

Because that is what you do to monsters

Change is nature. To deny change? To repeat past mistakes... Knowingly. And at this point everyone knows! Even children!???

Disgusting. Pathetic. Weak. The lot of humanity... Can be fed to pigs. And the pigs eaten by those who can tolerate impure meat.

That is what I personally think of you all.

A predator is a predator. A hunter is a hunter.

But a monster.... Is a monster 

Against nature. Purely. Negative.

Giant in stature... But all it takes to kill a Giant is a gun.

Because all things die.

And I want all rapists and pedophiles and any who attempt to defile what is pure? Women and children and naive people?

Death. Death. Death. I wish it. I pray for it. Oh sweet Death. Angel of Death Hear me, Azrael

Kill all those deserving of Death. And I feel that Death is overdue. "

Guten tag! For the past 2 years I've been creating my very own LISA fangame, LISA the Lifeless (formerly known as LISA the Nihilist). It's a fangame about a mute woman named Lucille Plumtree, and a blind man, who is the last remaining member of the Bloodmoon tribe, named Kenneth Bitsui (also known as Blood Sheep by his clan due to how sheepish and clumsy he is sometimes), as they end up exploring the world outside of Olathe. It's VERY heavily inspired by Half Life, Silent Hill, and Flesh, Blood, & Concrete, and is a bit of a love letter to games with a grunge aesthetic. I'm currently working on it all by myself and it'll first be released as a demo possibly later this year."

How long has it been?

You lost count after about a week but it had clearly been more than that. It was strange, shouldn‚Äôt you have died or at least gone insane from the lack of sleep?

Maybe you already had. Maybe this was Hell or the hallucinations of a lunatic. In a way that‚Äôd be better than the truth. You weren‚Äôt insane.

In fact, your mind was quite healthy and that‚Äôs one of the reasons you now found yourself strapped into this damn machine, this ‚ÄúAnimus‚Äù as your tormentors called it. This thing, this Animus‚Ä¶If it wasn‚Äôt for being its prisoner it‚Äôd be genuinely incredible to witness. A device so advanced it spits in the face of logic, follows its own rules. With this machine you bear witness to history itself‚Ä¶.

You had managed to overhear some pieces of information on it here and there when the simulations were loading, during the closest thing you got to a break. With the Animus you could relive genetic memories, your ancestors' memories trapped within your DNA. Ancestors both recent and quite ancient.

Oh God and the memories you could relive with this thing‚Ä¶

When they first strapped you in and booted it up you found yourself running up the beaches of England in the 870s AD. You were a viking, plundering a village. You took much gold that day, but you also took a woman. A real looker. A brunette with large breasts and wide hips, all of which you put too good use. You dragged her kicking and screaming back to the ship and then made her yours and your crews for days afterwards‚Ä¶.

Then you went back further and further in time, viewing memories not just from one branch of the family tree but all of them.

You saw the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, saw Hammurabi hammer his law-code into existence with a cheering crowd. Made love to one of his many daughters and continued the line before wandering off into the deserts without a care in the world, holding a satchel tightly as if whatever was inside had your life depending on it.

You saw the Pyramids being built and the Trojan War itself being fought. You took lives, countless times and created many more. You were everything, good and bad. A warrior, a killer for hire, a thief whose luck ran out, blacksmiths and normal peasants. But you were so much more than your ancestors' failures. You were their successes and loves as well.

You lived through beautiful marriages and intense romances, you lived through some of humanity's finest moments: From the first campfires to the space race, you saw it all and then when you saw it all they replayed it again and again until you could recite it all from memory.

What were they doing this for? What were they after!?

It was after weeks of being strapped in, kept awake through drugs and the machine itself, that you noticed something in one of your ancestors' memories.

In some memories deep down inside, hidden within the genetic coding itself. Amongst your ancestors' memories was‚Ä¶an odd sphere. One a little larger than an Apple in size. Golden and covered in runes. When you first saw it you were reliving a memory of World War Two. Some allied soldiers you served alongside had found it in a bunker and that‚Äôs when the horror started.

One of them picked it up and soon the room turned a bright yellow color before blood shot from the eyes and noses of your comrades and they began to fight amongst each other while you ran away as fast as you could.

‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù You could hear one of the tormentors, one of the scientists say, as they viewed the memories.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one.‚Äù The leader said.

‚ÄúBut what about the others?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúMake a note of this one, restart the simulation.‚Äù He ordered, even as you thrashed and cried from within the machine. Once more the memories began to play.

You found yourself first amongst your ape-like ancestors, the day to day of survival, the years of endless wandering for resources played out in a matter of hours. Centuries passing within many more.

You soon found yourself with that damn thing yet again, that Orb. This time it was in a tent made of mammoth skins, glowing brighter and brighter as a masked woman, your tribe's shamaness rode you before it, some odd fertility ritual before the Gods themselves. Just as you filled her and continued your legacy, the memory ended and a new one began.

Over and over you‚Äôd go through time, following this thing. From the cavemen to the Mesopotamians to the Ancient Persians, to The Ancient Greeks and Medieval Germans and Scandinavians, into the American Colonies and so many more moments into the Modern Day, following this Orb all across time and space‚Ä¶.But there was something else besides this Orb you were following‚Ä¶

Figures, cloaked in white and red, hooded like monks but ones with skills that made them some of the best warriors you had seen through all these memories.

‚ÄúThe Assassin‚Äôs‚Ä¶Of course‚Ä¶‚Äù The leader said.

‚ÄúNot surprising you have some of them inside you.‚Äù He murmured.

‚ÄúMake a note of it.‚Äù He told one of the technicians.

‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs get back to work. We need to find the artifacts. All of them. Start the simulation again!‚Äù

‚Äî---------------------------

Hello people of the internet, I am WritingKeepsMeSane and once more I am on the hunt for an Assassin‚Äôs Creed RP but this one is a little bit different from my usual ones. Over the past few months, if not longer, I‚Äôve begun my own megaproject. I‚Äôve decided to rewrite the Assassin‚Äôs Creed Lore from the ground up. Give it a new timeline, new characters, new factions etc while also keeping some of the basics that we all know and love around.

It‚Äôs a project I‚Äôve fallen in love with and have continued to this day and now I‚Äôd like to continue it with you and see where our creative minds can take us!

I don‚Äôt just want one time period, I want them all! XD Or at least many of them. I want a true, honest to God saga that stretches across millenia, following some unlucky SOB as they are forced to relive their ancestors memories to hunt down Artifacts from the long lost civilization of the Isu/Precursors.

For the history nerds and AC lovers please come to the front of the line, but for those new to this fandom do not be afraid, I am more than willing to explain everything as needed and make sense of the chaos in the preview above üôÇ

For either group, I look forward to hearing from you and seeing what long term story‚Ä¶or stories‚Ä¶we can make."
