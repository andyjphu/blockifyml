A (very poor) attempt at assigning algebraic notation to SMT moves.,Megaten,1i91qyj,2025-01-24 13:05:35,25,0.9,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaten/comments/1i91qyj/a_very_poor_attempt_at_assigning_algebraic/,Moonsht_007,,"So I am playing Nocturne.  
People usually say that the best way to play, well any game, is to experiment and mess around with its mechanics. They are right. Any game, including Nocturne, is at its most fun when you just head dive deep into fights blind.

I read guides to get a clue of what I am supposed to do (lame I know), but guides (especially the MegaTen wiki) split the boss stats and moveset and its description of the boss AI pretty far away. That's not fun to read, just scrolling back and forth between the former and latter.

Chess is one of the oldest turn-based game, and to describe a game of chess, people no longer use words, people use symbols to describe it, to shorten and make a review of a game quicker. So based on the idea of notations, I come up with this:

1. Physical Moves: Physical moves generally have distinct names, and for a good reason. They are based of something that describe forces or weapons. Sure there are very iconic names like Hassou Tobi, Agneyastra, God's Hand, etc... but there are loads of these moves, and I've came up to describe it in a simple way: (Total Number of Hits/Range of Number of Hits) - (Single/Multi-Target) - (Level of Damage) - Physical (shortened to P) Example: Hassou Tobi will be 8(Hits) M(Multi Target) L(Light) P (Physical): 8MLP. If it crits, it will be 8MLP+ (yes, the + is for critical). If a physical move just hit once, we can ignore the number. Example: A 1-hit single target heavy physical is written as SHP. A 2 to 4 hit multi target light physical attack is abbreviated as \[2;4\]MLP. Gun moves will use the letter G. 
2. Elemental Moves. The way elemental moves will be abbreviated will be the same, but the letter will be base on the first letter of the spell. Agi will use A, Bufu will use B, Zio will use Z, and Almighty will be Am. A quick exception will be Garu/Zan since it is now conflicted with gun and Elec spells. I decided to allocate the letter W (Wind) for the spell. So Mabufudyne will be MHB, Ragnarok will be SSA(severe agi), Megidolaon will be MSAm.  
3. Buffs/Debuffs. I decided to code physical attack, magic attack, defense, accuracy/evasion as PT,MT,R,S respectively (Taru-, Maka-, Raku-, Suku-,) with buff will be using the + sign, debuffs will be using the - sign. So for example, Red Capote will be written as S++++, and Fog Breath will be S--. If the only letter T is used, it means it is buffing/debuffing both types of attack. Debilitate will be written as such (T-;R-;S-) Dekaja/Dekunda will be using the De, with Dekaja using De-; and Dekunda will be using De+.
4. Healing Moves. This one will be using the letter D, for example Dia will be SD; and Mediarahan will be MHD. 
5. Any pass turns, skip turns because of status effects will be denoted by a X. 
6. Tetrakarn/Makarakarn. I am shortening it to Tk and Mk.
7. Items. Healing HP items will be denoted by HPi (no matter how much it heals). Healing SP items will be denoted by SPi (no matter how much it heals) Items that are the same as spells use the same notation as the spell itself, with an extra lowercase I at the end. 
8. Death/Fainted will be denoted by a double X. 
9. Instakill spells. Mudo will be denote by a M, and Hama will be denoted by a H. I decided to ignore the level of the spell, as either these spells hits, or not. So a Mudo that hit is denoted as M!XX, and a Hama that is missed is denoted as HX. Multi Target insta-kill will be denoted as such M(Multi-Targer) (M/H) (Number of party members killed). If it kills none, we ignored the number.

My thoughts on Smite 2 (Had to post here because Official Smite page instablocked the post. ☠️),gank,1i7uzrr,2025-01-22 23:07:13,0,0.21,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gank/comments/1i7uzrr/my_thoughts_on_smite_2_had_to_post_here_because/,David_Muhammad,,"Alright, prepare for a quite a Yap session.  
First off, this is no slight to the Devs, I see them honestly trying their best, and working with an unfortunate starting line. That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be honest, just to make them feel good, nor should we seek to tear them down.

1.) I don’t care about the skins. I had money to blow & I blew it, with no anticipation of getting it back. However, I can understand some people‘s complaints when they say they’re upset they lost skins, and the game isn’t transformative enough to warrant that. Before you say, “Spaghetti code this, and spaghetti code that” I get it. We’ve heard this for years, but none of the normal players are Devs, we haven’t seen this “spaghetti code” & even if we did, we’d have no idea what we’re looking at. I doubt the Devs lied about that, but to basically make the same game with a better engine…. Idk, it’s just not the Smite 2 I was looking for. I wanted something truly revolutionary & transformative. Not the same game, with my characters getting “+1s” to their kits. I don’t see the current state of the game attracting AND MAINTAINING all that much of a new audience. They’ll probably get the same Smite 1 audience back, with a couple new bloods, to replace the old heads who’ve gone into retirement. Once again, this isn’t an insult. It’s my honest observation. I don’t see too many people who saw Smite 1 & decided to pass on it, looking at Smite 2 & saying to themselves, “Yep! This is it!!” (Props given where they are due, Aladdin was a strong step in the right direction.)

2.) This horse has been beaten to death, and the Devs have done a good amount to mitigate how rough it feels, but the amount of CC in the game in 2025 is just absurd. Especially, since they reduced the time to kill, which I think was a great choice if I must say. With that being said, there’s nothing fun about being killed simply because I can’t move. Adding in the CC buffering smoothed it out a little bit, but honestly, all I can think is “but why though?” The answer we got? This game isn’t Isometric like league, it’s skill shot based, so there needs to be a way to confirm your attacks. I personally say nay, you should have experimented with the idea of, “If you whiff, you whiff. Git Gud.” There’s not really too much skill in shooting a stationary target that can barely fight back. Predecessor is complete BUTT CHEEKS compared to Smite & Smite 2, but there’s drastically less CC in that game, which is also skill shot based & it doesn’t feel bad at all. The same goes for the new Marvel Rivals game, which is literally DEMOLISHING all competition across the board. I get it, Marvel Rivals is a hero shooter, but before the whole, “Maybe you don’t like MOBAs anymore, maybe you like Hero Shooters now” argument gets dropped, no I hate hero shooters. Tried Overwatch, hated it. Tried Paladins, didn’t hate it, but wasn’t a fan either. I’ll come back to this later in another point, though. Anyway, back to the topic at hand, I get that Smite & it’s characters were literally designed around CC, but as it’s been pointed out numerous times, by various people, this was a new game. There was every opportunity to reinvent the wheel & go a different direction. It honestly feels like the Devs want to do something new, but PROBABLY DUE TO COMMUNITY BACKLASH, they’re scared to mix things up too much. So, it gives the game a one foot in & one foot out feeling.

3.) This one is a short one, but there are multiple little hiccups in the console store that make buying items feel…. well rough tbh. I know the devs have heard complaints about this & I’m sure they’re gonna fix it, so I won’t harp on this point.

4.) Using the conquest map for assault doesn’t work. The mid lane is just too small & it feels incredibly cramped. Maybe that’s just a map issue, though. As in, maybe the conquest map is just way too small in general. It’s an Alpha/Beta/early access, whatever you wanna call it, though. So, I doubt this is the permanent map. It still needed to be addressed nonetheless.

5.) Coming back to Marvel Rivals, there’s a lot I think could be learned from this game. First & foremost, the way abilities are designed in that game. They’re not scared to create strong, and wacky abilities & then give those abilities an extra long cooldown so that they’re not too oppressive. That’s good stuff right there & would do a lot to take the frustration out to of the kits of certain characters. Does that mean you would only get to use an ability 5 or so times in a match? Yea certainly, but if the value of the ability was worth it, nobody would complain, IMO. Also in Rivals, characters who have movement abilities usually have multiple instances of it & each instance is on its own cooldown, which gives the player more agency on how it’s used. So, for Nemesis, who has 2 dashes. Instead of dashing & then having a time limit in which you can dash again before the whole ability goes on cooldown. It would feel better if she could dash, that instance of dash goes on it’s own cooldown, and she can either choose to dash again, or hold the second dash for whenever it becomes relevant to use it. Another one we can look at is Ares. In Smite, Ares chains you & you can’t use any movement ability(This is true of most cripples). This goes back to, “It’s not fun to die, just because I can’t move, or respond to the enemy.” Especially, when Ares, or a cripple essentially silences half your kit. In Rivals, venom has a similar ability, but instead of keeping you from using your abilities, if you break his tendrils, you take damage. So, for Ares, his chains could maybe slow you or whatever, but you can still use movement abilities, but if you break his chains, you take damage. That allows Ares to continue feeling good to play, without creating a terrible experience for the other player.  
  
5B.) I really think verticality would have done wonders for this game. A larger map, both in area & in vertical scale would have looked beautiful, and would have created a lot of new & interesting mechanics. Aladdin, who I’ve already praised as a good step, could have REALLY done some cooky things on a vertically accessible map. As could other characters. Awilix sneaking up on you from up above & pouncing down with Suku, is yet another example. It’s probably too late for this suggestion, but maybe the devs can work on it in the background & drop some crazy update one day in the future. 

5C.) The game is already moving in this direction, which is a good thing, but don’t be so strict about character roles/classes. Create characters that just feel good, and allow the players to decide how those characters are used. Of course, there needs to be some undertone of direction, but if I want to Aphrodite Jungle, let me Aphrodite jungle. Heck if we want to double jungle for some weird reason, let us double jungle. Lmfao. LET ME HAVE FUN!! People who want to take things serious, will take things serious in ranked, and people who want to screw around, well that’s what casual lobbies are for & who knows? We might just create a whole new crazy META that nobody foresaw. Just give players agency. That’s the number 1 thing, that I feel people love about rivals. You have nigh complete player agency & that just feels good.

5D.) Standardize the currency. Marvel Rivals has proved you don’t need to Jedi mind trick players on how much skins cost, by making the currency hard to calculate. People will happily pay $15-20, with zero complaints, for skins, as long as you make a fun game. Which by the way, is how much skins cost in Rivals, and they are getting bought, without any tears.

5E.) Create counter characters. Instead of relying solely on items, create characters, whose kits are specifically meant to counter certain things. I know the idea behind Nox was, she was supposed to be an Anti-Mage. Go back to that idea, because that was cooking!! Create Anti-healers, and Anti-tanks, etc etc. It won’t matter the most in casual lobbies, but in ranked lobbies, it will give players a little something extra to think about & allow more opportunities for other characters to get played. That way, you don’t have to buff someone to Godhood, or nerf someone to the ground, just to get certain characters into the Meta.

Yap session complete. I hope you enjoyed my PHD thesis on Smite 2. Lol."

**BANGSA-BANGSA DI SEMENANJUNG MALAYSIA**

**Orang Asli**

Suku kaum paling primitif yang masih wujud di Asia Tenggara dan kepulauan Melayu adalah kaum Negrito kerdil, yang dikenali sebagai Semang di Kedah dan Perak, dan Pangan di Kelantan. Para pengembara kecil berkulit hitam dan berambut kerinting ini berkait rapat dengan kaum Aeta di Filipina dan Mincopie di Kepulauan Andaman. Di Tanah Melayu, hanya terdapat 2,000 daripada mereka, hidup dengan memakan buah-buahan hutan, ubi-ubian dan binatang liar. Senjata mereka ialah panah dan anak panah, tetapi mereka telah meminjam tiup-buluh daripada suku Sakai, yang dengannya mereka telah berkahwin campur. Mereka tidak membina rumah mahupun perahu, tetapi tidur mengelilingi api unggun di hutan pada lantai kayu dan berlindung di bawah bumbung daun yang disokong oleh tongkat. Bebas daripada jenayah yang timbul daripada ketamakan dan nafsu, mereka hidup dalam kumpulan keluarga tanpa kelas pemerintah atau organisasi puak. Mereka takut pada guruh dan kilat dan mengeluarkan darah dari betis mereka untuk memuaskan kuasa-kuasa ghaib yang menyebabkannya.

Lebih tinggi lagi dalam skala tamadun ialah kaum Sakai atau Senoi yang lebih tinggi, berkulit cerah, dan berambut kerinting di kawasan pergunungan dan kaki gunung. Mereka adalah orang-orang berbilang warna perang kecoklatan keturunan Indonesia, yang merupakan salah satu komponen kaum Melayu, tetapi bahasa mereka kebanyakannya dari rumpun Mon-Annam. Mereka serupa dengan suku-suku gunung di Yunnan, Indochina dan kepulauan Melayu, tetapi mereka di kaki gunung tidak hanya berkahwin campur dengan Negrito di utara dan Jakun atau proto-Melayu di selatan tetapi menunjukkan campuran Australo-Melanesia; iaitu, jejak keturunan nenek moyang Papuan dan penduduk asli Australia. Terdapat kira-kira 20,000 Sakai, terbahagi kepada puak dan keluarga di bawah ketua-ketua patriarki. Rumah mereka, seperti rumah orang Melayu, dibina di atas tiang, dan mereka menanam padi, gula, millet, pisang dan tembakau, berpindah ke kawasan penanaman baru apabila tanah itu habis. Seperti orang Melayu purba, mereka beranimisme, takut kepada banyak roh penyakit. Seperti orang Melayu dan Mongol, mereka mempercayai dukun, memberikannya pengebumian di atas pokok, seperti yang pernah dilakukan oleh orang Melayu, untuk membiarkan harimau peliharaan mereka merobek tubuh dan melepaskan rohnya.

Di bahagian selatan Tanah Melayu British terdapat suku kaum primitif, yang nenek moyang proto-Melayu mereka berpindah dari Yunnan dan merentasi Indochina. Sama ada di darat atau laut, Jakun, sebagaimana mereka menamakan diri mereka di Tanah Melayu, mempunyai campuran keturunan Indonesia dan Mongoloid, yang bersama dengan darah asing yang diperolehi pada zaman sejarah, membentuk Melayu moden yang bertamadun. Tetapi ada juga di antara mereka yang menunjukkan keturunan Australo-Melanesia yang sangat awal dan seseorang dapat melihat Jakun Johor yang besar, berkulit hitam dan berjanggut seperti seorang Papuan. Suku-suku hutan hidup dengan buah-buahan dan permainan liar, dan Orang Laut (Orang Laut Kipling) atau Orang Laut dengan memancing, keluarga mereka bersama mereka di dalam bot atau di darat di dalam pondok. Suku laut ini akan menusuk ikan dengan tombak kayu, dan pada zaman moden, mereka menyelam untuk mencari syiling di pelabuhan Singapura. Tome Pires, penulis Portugis (1515), adalah orang pertama yang memanggil mereka “Cellates,” yang mungkin bermaksud Rakyat Selat atau Selat. Beliau menggambarkan mereka sebagai lanun yang menghantui kepulauan Karimun, menunjukkan pelabuhan Melaka kepada pengasasnya dan mengambil bahagian dengan tiup-buluh mereka dalam mempertahankan Melaka menentang d'Albuquerque. Beliau menambah bahawa pengasas Melaka telah memberi ganjaran kepada pengikut pribumi ini dengan memberi mereka gelaran dan jawatan seperti Bendahara atau Perdana Menteri dan Laksamana atau Laksamana, yang menjadikan mereka sebagai nenek moyang kepada keluarga-keluarga Melayu terkemuka. Pada abad ke-18, mereka masih setia kepada sultan-sultan Johor, yang dengan hormatnya memberi mereka gelaran-gelaran yang hebat. Agama mereka adalah animisme, kepercayaan bahawa pokok dan batu dianimasikan oleh roh yang hidup, tetapi daripada jiran-jiran mereka yang bertamadun, mereka juga belajar untuk memanggil dewa Hindu. Bahasa mereka ialah Bahasa Melayu, yang bebas daripada perkataan pinjaman asing.

Orang asli Tanah Melayu semakin tidak berpindah randah.

**Melayu Bertamadun**

Penghijrahan orang Melayu dari Yunnan ke Semenanjung Tanah Melayu berlaku antara 2500 dan 1500 SM. Budaya kapak segi empat mereka, yang disertai dengan periuk tanah liat bertanda tali tanpa glazur yang pelbagai, telah dikesan dari China ke selatan, dan “kapak-pahat yang sangat khusus di Jawa dan Sumatera daripada jenis kapak yang mudah dengan bahagian rentas segi empat dan tepi separa bulat yang terdapat di Laos melalui jenis perantaraan yang kerap di Tanah Melayu menunjukkan arah dan cara penghijrahan mereka”—iaitu, ke bawah Semenanjung Tanah Melayu. Sesetengahnya mungkin berjalan di darat, yang lain melintasi Teluk Siam di dalam kraf yang dibangunkan daripada tiang buluh yang masih digunakan di sungai-sungai di Burma dan Indochina. Antara gelombang terawal mungkin Jakun. Tetapi pergerakan yang paling penting membawa nenek moyang orang Melayu di Kedah, Kelantan dan Patani untuk menjadi rakyat beradab Hindu Langkasuka dan Sri Vijaya. Orang Kelantan, yang telah dibandingkan dengan orang Polynesia, lebih besar daripada orang Melayu di selatan, mungkin kerana mereka mewakili keturunan yang berbeza, mungkin disebabkan iklim yang lebih baik atau makanan yang lebih baik di kawasan padi purba.

Untuk budaya orang Melayu purba, bahasa dan penemuan prasejarah adalah satu-satunya bukti. Dan sementara orang yang nampaknya mempunyai keturunan Australo-Melanesia tinggal di gua atau meninggalkan timbunan cengkerang gergasi, serpihan makanan prasejarah, untuk menyaksikan lokasi mereka, orang Indonesia yang lebih bertamadun dan orang Melayu purba mendiami kampung yang hanya didedahkan oleh sesuatu kejadian seperti banjir besar 1926, yang menggali salah satunya di Tembeling, Pahang. Namun, terdapat banyak bukti bahawa, sebelum orang-orang neolitik ini meninggalkan benua Asia, mereka telah membuat tembikar dan membina megalit. Mereka adalah pemburu—tidak hanya permainan tetapi juga kepala manusia demi zat jiwa mereka. Mereka adalah nelayan yang biasa dengan perangkap buluh dan kayu, walaupun rupanya bukan dengan jaring lontar atau jaring tali lain. Mereka hidup, seperti penduduk kampung masih hidup, di dalam rumah yang dibina di atas tiang dan diikat dengan rotan, dengan lantai dan dinding buluh. Di kebun mereka, mereka menanam tebu, pisang, labu dan kelapa. Tanaman ladang mereka adalah millet (masih tanaman Sakai) dan padi, yang keduanya memberi mereka makanan dan minuman yang ditapai. Mereka telah menjinakkan babi dan kerbau dan mungkin lembu. Pakaian mereka adalah kulit kayu. Nombor mereka meningkat sehingga seribu dan mereka mempunyai sedikit pengetahuan tentang bintang-bintang.

Sudah tentu lama sebelum era Kristian bahawa nama-nama Melayu diberikan kepada banyak bahagian di Tanah Melayu seperti Kelantan, Muar dan Temasik (yang orang Hindu ubah kepada Singapura). Makna Naning, contohnya, telah dilupakan hari ini, tetapi kita tahu daripada unsur Melayu dalam Khasi Assam bahawa ia bermaksud ""di hulu"". Mungkin tiada nama umum yang diterima pakai oleh puak-puak yang tersebar sehingga Jambi atau Melayu menggantikan Sri Vijaya pada abad ke-13, selepas itu mereka menggelarkan diri mereka sebagai Melayu.

Jambi jatuh, digantikan oleh Minangkabau di pedalaman. Tetapi apabila Melaka diasaskan dengan penduduk yang kebanyakannya terdiri daripada pengembara laut Melayu, perdagangannya menarik ramai orang Melayu dari pantai Sumatera yang bertentangan, terutamanya Hindu Minangkabau, yang mencari kawasan perlombongan emas di Pahang dan lembah-lembah yang pada abad ke-18 menjadi Negeri Sembilan. Bugis, juga dari Sulawesi, pada tahun 1700 mendirikan Selangor moden dan pada tahun 1722 menjadi Raja-raja takluk empayar Johor. Kebanyakan pendatang Bugis, sekurang-kurangnya, adalah orang yang mulia yang berkahwin campur dengan keluarga diraja di Semenanjung dan menguasai rakyat Melayu tempatan mereka. Dan menyimpulkan daripada legenda Sejarah Melayu bahawa kebanyakan orang Melayu di semenanjung menyeberangi dari Sumatera pada zaman pertengahan adalah untuk mengabaikan bukti prasejarah dan nama-nama tempat. Orang Melayu sekurang-kurangnya mempunyai hak yang sama untuk dianggap sebagai penduduk asli Tanah Melayu seperti orang Inggeris yang dipanggil sebagai penduduk asli Inggeris.

Melayu hari ini, seorang individu berkepala lebar dengan kulit zaitun, mata yang halus, badan yang kemas dan seimbang, rambut hitam lurus dan dagu yang hampir tanpa rambut, adalah orang Melayu purba ditambah dengan banyak keturunan asing yang berasal daripada perkahwinan dengan orang Cina dari zaman Chou sehingga kedatangan Islam, dengan orang Hindu Deccan dan Bengal, dengan orang India Muslim, Siam dan Arab. Mereka tidak banyak berubah sejak adik ipar Magellan, Duarte Barbosa, menggambarkan mereka daripada pengalamannya di Timur antara tahun 1500 dan 1517: ""Mereka adalah lelaki yang berbadan tegap dan telanjang dari pinggang ke atas tetapi berpakaian dengan pakaian kapas di bawah. Mereka yang paling terkemuka di antara mereka memakai kot pendek yang sampai separuh paha, daripada kain sutera—dengan corak atau sulaman—dan di atasnya mereka memakai tali pinggang; di pinggang mereka memakai pisau keris dengan ukiran yang mereka panggil keris.

Wanita mereka berwarna perang, berpakaian dengan pakaian sutera yang sangat halus dan skirt pendek yang dihiasi dengan emas dan perhiasan. Mereka cantik, sentiasa berpakaian rapi dan mempunyai rambut yang sangat halus. . . . Mereka tinggal di rumah besar di luar bandar dengan banyak kebun buah-buahan, taman dan kolam, di mana mereka menjalani kehidupan yang menyeronokkan. Mereka halus dan sopan, suka muzik dan suka bercinta.""

Untuk membawa gambaran itu ke masa kini: semua kecuali petani yang bekerja di ladangnya memakai kot sekarang: keris hanya dipakai pada upacara istana, dan banyak orang Melayu telah mengguna pakai pakaian Eropah untuk waktu bekerja. Beberapa tahun yang lalu apabila seorang Residen mengeluarkan edaran memuji pakaian Melayu dan menyokong pengekalan pakaian itu, para ketua Melayu pada pertemuan Majlis Negeri seterusnya bertanya kepadanya sebabnya: adakah dia bimbang bahawa mereka akan mendapat kudis dhobi\*? (\*Bahasa Hindustan untuk ""pencuci"").

Sungguh malang bahawa kehidupan moden dan kekaguman orang Melayu sendiri terhadap cara Eropah telah bergabung untuk membuat orang putih melupakan apa yang diketahui oleh Cik Isabella Bird, pengarang The Golden Chersonese, pada tahun 1879: "" Orang Melayu sudah pasti harus dikira di kalangan bangsa-bangsa yang bertamadun... Mereka telah memiliki sistem pemerintahan dan undang-undang tanah dan maritim selama beberapa abad, yang sekurang-kurangnya secara teorinya menunjukkan darjah ketamadunan yang tinggi.""

Orang Melayu mempunyai rasa bangga yang tinggi terhadap kaum mereka— mungkin disebabkan oleh agama Islam mereka, tetapi juga terhadap masa lalu yang telah mereka lupakan. Dia mempunyai, seperti yang pernah ditulis oleh Tuan Frank Swettenham, ""semangat keberanian yang sama baiknya dengan kebanyakan lelaki"", dan rasa nilai yang lebih baik dari apa yang ditawarkan oleh kehidupan daripada yang biasanya diperoleh daripada falsafah buku. Malah Orang Asli Tanah Melayu mempunyai budi bahasa yang menarik, dan Orang Melayu tidak hanya menjalani disiplin adab Hindu tetapi juga telah terpengaruh dengan ajaran Islamnya sama seperti budak Inggeris telah dipengaruhi oleh sekolah swasta, memperoleh daya dan keyakinan. Kerana dia adalah petani bebas yang tidak perlu bekerja upahan, Orang Melayu telah mendapat reputasi yang tidak wajar untuk kemalasan, yang dijaga oleh pesaing Asia mereka. Dalam hal urusan, dia bukan sahaja diplomatik tetapi juga bijaksana dan berkepala dingin, dengan keupayaan semula jadi untuk menimbang kedua-dua belah pihak isu sesuatu masalah. Kehidupan rumah tangga beliau bahagia. Dia berkahwin muda, tetapi walaupun terdapat keleluasan dalam praktik Islam, petani jarang poligami, walaupun keperluan abadi untuk anak lelaki untuk mengerjakan ladangnya membuatnya cenderung untuk menceraikan isteri yang mandul.

Pada bancian 1947, daripada 2,395,123 orang Melayu di Persekutuan, 264,630 adalah pendatang baru dari Sumatra dan Jawa, lelaki dari kaum dan agama orang Melayu sendiri, yang sahaja daripada pendatang negara itu dengan cepat diserap ke dalam masyarakat Melayu. Di Persekutuan juga, orang Melayu membentuk 43.77 peratus daripada jumlah penduduk dan Cina 38.6 peratus. Tetapi di Kelantan, contohnya, penduduknya hampir sepenuhnya Melayu."

my dad is a Bengkulu / Bangkahulu. He is a proud bengkulu but i couldn't be arsed to learn the language. like my mum used to say: ORANG BENGKULU SEMUANYA PENJAHAT. historically it is true as my moyang on dad side was among the first settler there, and he told us when we were small the circumstances that made them leave sumatra and come to malaya.

Muhammad Kebungsuan meninggalkan Johor dan tiba di Malabang, Cotabato, pada tahun 1475.[5] Beliau datang bersama-sama dengan suku Orang Laut Bajau-Samah yang sudah Islam, dan dengan bantuan mereka berjaya mengatasi rintangan penduduk asli tempatan.[5] Selain suku nomad Bajau-Samah, usaha beliau juga dibantu oleh Tabunaway, seorang datu tempatan.[4] Setelah berjaya mengawal Lembah Cotabato, Muhammad Kebungsuan menetap di sana manakala suku Bajau-Samah meneruskan perjalanan ke Teluk Sarangani dan Teluk Davao.[4]

Muhammad Kebungsuan kemudiannya berkahwin dengan anak-anak perempuan dari para ketua puak-puak tempatan.[6] Ramai orang-orang asli di sekitar Lembah Cotabato kemudian masuk Islam, antaranya ialah suku-suku Magindanao, Slangan, Matampay, Lusud, Katittwan, Simway, dan lain-lain.[4] Sebahagian daripada orang asli yang enggan menyertai pergi ke gunung, yang merupakan nenek moyang suku kaum asli Bilaan, Monobo, Subanun, Tiruray, Tagabilis, dan lain-lain pada masa ini.[6][7]

Pada sekitar tahun 1515, Muhammad Kebungsuan mengasaskan Kesultanan Maguindanao.[6] Keturunan beliau dan wanita tempatan meneruskan usaha beliau untuk menyebarkan agama Islam, sehingga kaum Iranun (di pantai Malabang) dan kaum Maranao (Tasik Lanao) secara keseluruhannya juga telah memeluk agama Islam pada masa kedatangan penjajah Sepanyol di kawasan itu.[7]

Bekas wilayah Shariff Kabunsuan di Filipina dinamakan sempena nama beliau.[8]

Aiheesta voisi kirjoittaa todella pitkän tekstin esimerkkeineen ja sekoiluineen mutta yritän pitää asian tiiviinä ja rönsyilemättömänä.

Olen kolmissakymmenissä vaimoni kanssa ja meillä on kesällä syntynyt lapsi.

Äitini on ollut painosanalla _aina_ ja _todella_ herkästi minun ja muiden asioihin sekaantuva ja aina hänellä on tuntunut olevan oma (oikea) mielipiteensä siitä miten asiat tulisi hoitaa.
Vaikka tuo on välillä todella raskasta niin vuosien aikana olen tottunut käytökseen ja pystyn kyllä suodattamaan hänen usein kärkkäät ja suodattamattomat kommentit.

Nyt kuitenkin lapseni syntymän (hänen ensimmäinen lapsenlapsi) ja tuoreen vihkiytymiseni myötä hän on tuntunut menevän ihan hulluksi. Viimeisimpänä eilen yhteistä joulua suvun kanssa vietettäessä hän kommentoi vaimolleni kärkkäästi miten tulevaa hääjuhlaa suunniteltaessa meidän vierasmäärä (tällä hetkellä kolmisenkymmentä) on aivan liian maltillinen ja lisäksi alkoi kertomaan ketä häihin tulisi kutsua.
Minulla on iso ja läheinen suku sekä laaja kaveripiiri, mutta haluamme pitää mahdollisimman pienet häät.

Yleisimmät yhteenotot liittyvät lapsen kasvatukseen ja siihen kuinka yritämme ""eristää"" lapsen isovanhemmilta (näkevät lastamme noin kerran viikossa).

Olemme aikuisia ihmisiä, pystyn sanomaan äidilleni vastaan,  emme anna äitini vaikuttaa päätöksiimme enkä oikeastaan anna hänen kommenttien mennä ihon allekaan. Harmittaa vaan, että tällä käytöksellään hän työntää meitä kauemmas itsestään. Olemme aina olleet todella läheisiä, asumme samalla kylällä ja olemme olleet tekemisissä viikoittain. Hyvänä esimerkkinä, vihkimisemme tapahtui maistraatissa ja äitilleni kerroin tästä vasta vihkimisen tapahduttua, juurikin sen takia koska en halunnut vääntää hänen kanssaan siitä kuinka tuon vihkimisen olisi pitänyt tapahtua.

Ongelmahan ei ratkea muuten kuin keskustelemalla ja olenkin jutellut vanhempieni kanssa asiasta, mutta tuntuu menevän äitini puolelta jopa huudoksi siitä kuinka en kunnioita vanhempia. Toisaalta niinkuin mainitsin, olen tähän tottunut enkä anna asian mennä ihon alle.

Ylimääräistä asioihin puuttumista ja mielensäpahoittamista on myös vaimoni suvun puolelta mutta ei missään nimessä samoissa mittasuhteissa.

Onko muilla samankaltaisia kokemuksia, minkälaisiin tilanteisiin vanhempien kanssa jouduttiin ja miten tilanteissa toimittiin?

Edit:
Kiitos kaikille asiallisista, tsemppaavista kommenteista. Helpottavaa (ja harmillista) kuulla että en ole ainut tällaisessa tilanteessa, en voinut kuvitellakaan miten paljon samanlaisia kokemuksia kertyy.
Tsemppiä kaikille ja rauhallista joulua ❤️🎄🧑‍🎄"

Why gojo has 0 % chance against heian sukuna(with mostly new points),JujutsuPowerScaling,1hgd1xh,2024-12-17 10:27:37,0,0.49,42,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgd1xh,chosen1346,Debate,"Not using curse tools that would be overkill just using the image 

(Slide 1) it's 2024 we should know by now that heian sukuna has better stats than meguna 

(Slide 2-4)When meguna uses DA they are highly relative. Sukuna lands 2 chest hits in the beginning that knocks him back, and gojo lands a heavy rib shot. You can't use the times sukuna isnt using DA, as a way to judge their h2h because sukuna can't touch him. (You can go look for yourself everytime it's confirmed that meguna is using DA,they are highly relative. You can give the edge to gojo)

(Slide 5) one of the most important differences that people don't realize. Is heian sukuna endurance, he can cast and maintain with more significant injuries.

(Slide 6) heian sukuna can cast and maintain his domain with a damaged heart 2 cut off arms and 1 damaged arm. While meguna domain dropped when he had a damaged heart.

(Slide 7) Now we get into the jujutsu part. We know it's easier for heian sukuna to do chants and handsigns to increase his ct attacks and etc. I'll go more in depth. 

(Slide 8) sukuna is holding the handsigns to increase the output of his slashes(he does this in 258 as well)

(Slide 9) as you can see gojo is in a pool of blood  and the slashes are more potent.

(Slide 10) once sukuna let's go of the handsign to engage in h2h the slashes aren't as much and he isn't in a pool of blood. Now with 4 arms he could keep 2 arms locked with handsigns,and the other 2 to engage with gojo. Now you can use this to say it would make gojo time harder getting out of domain 1, since gojo said getting out the domain with regular slashes to meguna wasnt easy. This is also the first domain so he could use furnace here also if he wanted. But I'll just go with more stuff that can't be argued against.....

(Still Slide 10) sukuna could also increase his sure hit when he's in a clash against gojo. Gojo needed 3 mins and 9 seconds to hurt meguna so he couldnt maintain his domain, sukuna increasing the output would lower that time.

(Slide 11)hwb if sukuna wants to make sure he never gets hit by UV he can keep 2 arms locked for hwb and the other 2 to defend himself.

(Slide 12) you know how sukuna has to touch gojo to put all his for sure hit on the outside to instantly break gojo domain. We'll sukuna can do this method just by using hwb with 2 arms and putting all the sure hit on the outside to instantly break it.

(Slide 13-15) breaking the domains from the inside was confirmed in gota vs sukuna. Since gota couldn't control purple he accidentally missed most of sukuna and end up breaking his domain. Sukuna could do this same method why sending his own slashes at the barrier."

Welcome back to our [UPG of the Week](https://imgur.com/a/fjNr0LF), This week we are looking at the **Pattani Malay in Thailand**.

Yes, we have [done this people group before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/cl6ep7/unreached_people_group_of_the_week_the_pattani/), but it was time for a refresh because I know some people considering moving to work with this UPG.

# Region: Thailand - Pattani Province

[map](https://preview.redd.it/hu3cma83487e1.png?width=307&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba67fc0339c002e06100ebd933ebd2e5a4c85b1)

**Stratus Index Ranking** **(Urgency): 45**

It has been noted to me by u/JCmathetes that I should explain this ranking. Low numbers are more urgent, both physically and spiritually together, while high numbers are less urgent. The scale is 1-177, with one number assigned to each country. So basically on a scale from Afghanistan (1) to Finland (177), how urgent are the peoples physical and spiritual needs.

**Climate**: Thailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon).  Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate. The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate. Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate. A year in Thailand is divided into three seasons.  The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season (mid–May to mid–October), which is caused by southwestern wind from the Indian Ocean.  Rainfall is also contributed by Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and tropical cyclones,  with August and September being the wettest period of the year.  The country receives a mean annual rainfall of 1,200 to 1,600 mm (47 to 63 in).  Winter or the northeast monsoon occurs from mid–October until mid–February. Most of Thailand experiences dry weather with mild temperatures.  Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May. Due to their inland position and latitude, the north, northeast, central and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather, where temperatures can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F) during March to May,  in contrast to close to or below 0 °C (32 °F) in some (lol where?) areas in winter.  Southern Thailand is characterised by mild (super hot) weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences.  It receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.

**Terrain:** Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north of the country is the mountainous area of the **Thai highlands**, with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level. The northeast, Isan, consists of the **Khorat Plateau**, bordered to the east by the **Mekong River**. The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat **Chao Phraya** **river valley,** which runs into the **Gulf of Thailand**. Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula.

**Wildlife of Thailand**: Thailand is home to more than 10% of the world’s animals. There are more than 285 mammal species including elephants, tigers, leopards, Malaysian sun bears, sambars, deer and otters as well as a variety of primate species including gibbons, monkeys and macaques. Sheep, goats, wild cattle and wild hogs are also common. Larger mammals like elephants and tigers have witnessed dramatic drops in numbers and exist mainly in national parks and conservation areas. Thailand is home to numerous reptile and amphibian species including approximately 176 snake species including cobras, pythons and vipers. There are three species of tortoise living in Thailand - the Asian giant tortoise can live for over one hundred years. There are some 310 lizard species located around the country including common geckos and tree lizards, [monitor lizards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pifd7mKcymA) and water dragons.

Unfortunately, there are a metric poop ton of monkeys in Thailand

**Environmental Issues:** Thailand's dramatic economic growth has caused numerous environmental issues. The country faces problems with air, declining wildlife populations, deforestation, soil erosion, water scarcity, and waste issues.

**Languages:** The official language of Thailand is Thai, a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border. The largest of Thailand's minority languages is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken in the northeastern provinces. In the far south, Kelantan-Pattani Malay is the primary language of Malay Muslims. Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large Thai Chinese population, with the Teochew dialect best-represented. Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including many Austroasiatic languages such as Mon, Khmer, Viet, Mlabri and Aslian; Austronesian languages such as Cham, Moken and Urak Lawoi'; Sino-Tibetan languages like Lawa, Akha, and Karen; and other Tai languages such as Tai Yo, Phu Thai, and Saek. Hmong is a member of the Hmong–Mien languages, which is now regarded as a language family of its own. *The Pattani Malay speak Pattani Malay.*

**Government Type:** Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy

# People: Pattani Malay

[Pattani Malay women](https://preview.redd.it/u6jrlb0k787e1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a71d9aacf764b779e362c2cca1d73c510984b05)

**Population**: 1,573,000

**Estimated Foreign Workers Needed:** 31

**Beliefs:** The Pattani Malay are 0.01% Christian. That means out of their population of 1,573,000, there are likely only about 157 Christians. Thats roughly one believer for every 10,000 unbeliever.

The Pattani Malay are typically devout Muslims. 

[Mosque in the Pattani Province from 1945](https://preview.redd.it/4axvsklt487e1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f363e9942624bf0b98fedf2b53d75f88b45a2c9)

**History:** *Oddly enough, a history of this people is scattered, at least on Wikipedia, so I will piece together what I can.* 

The Pattani Malay are the descendants of Malaysian Muslims. Their Islamic faith has given the Pattani a distinct identity in Buddhist Thailand.

Patani has been suggested to be founded some time between 1350 and 1450, although its history before 1500 is unclear. According to the *Malay Annals*, Chau Sri Wangsa, a Siamese prince, founded Patani by conquering *Kota Mahligai*. He converted to Islam and took on the title of *Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah* in the late 15th to early 16th century. Patani may have become Islamised some time in the middle of 15th century, one source gives a date of 1470, but earlier dates have been proposed.

Patani became more important after Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511 as Muslim traders sought alternative trading ports. A Dutch source indicates that most of the traders were Chinese, but 300 Portuguese traders had also settled in Patani by 1540s, but there were also Siamese and Japanese merchants. Portuguese sources mentioned their attack on Patani in 1524 and Chinese living in the city. Raja Mahmud ruled in the mid-16th century and was seen as 'ruling justly' which caused considerable developments to the region.

Sultan Ismail Shah was succeeded by Mudhaffar Shah. This period saw the rise of Burma, which made war on Ayutthaya. Another Burmese-Siamese war (1563–1564) led by King Bayinnaung forced King Maha Chakkraphat to surrender in 1564. Taking advantage of the instability in Ayutthaya, the sultan of Patani Mudhaffar Shah attacked Ayutthaya in 1563 due to his unwelcome reception in the Thai court in the years prior. King Chakkraphat fled the city for two months but Mudhaffar failed to take the throne. He died suddenly in 1564 on his way back to Patani. His brother Sultan Manzur Shah (1564–1572) who was left in charge in Patani while he was away then became the ruler of Patani

***skipping ahead because much of this history is just other kings rising and falling*** 

In the 18th century, Ayutthaya under King Ekkathat faced another Burmese invasion. This culminated in the capture and destruction of the city of Ayutthaya in 1767, as well as the death of the king. Siam was shattered, and as rivals fought for the vacant throne, Patani declared its complete independence.

King Taksin defeated the Burmese and reunified the country, opening the way for the establishment of the Chakri dynasty by his successor, King Rama I. In 1786 Siam sent an army led by Prince Surasi (Viceroy Boworn Maha Surasinghanat), younger brother of King Rama I, to seek the submission of Patani.

The siege of Patani by Siam occurred in 1786, this is followed by the destruction of the town, massacres as well as deportations of the inhabitants. Further, Siam invaded Patani several times in 1789–1791, 1808, 1831–1832 and 1838. This served to completely end the centuries old mandala system, effectively ending Pattani's status of an independent state. Bangkok divided Patani into seven small principalities (*hua muang*). Britain recognised the Siamese ownership of Patani in the Burney Treaty in 1826. The throne stayed vacant for a few decades until 1842, when a member of Kelantanese royalty returned to reclaim the throne. While the raja ruled over Patani independently of Siam, Patani also recognised the authority of Siam and regularly sent the bunga mas tribute.

In 1902, in a bid to assert full control of Patani, Siam arrested and deposed the last raja of Patani after he refused Siam's demand for administrative reform, thus ending Patani as an independent state.

**Culture:** *Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

Most Pattani Malays are self-employed either as farmers or fishermen.  
  
Over the years, their unique Muslim culture has led to many separatist movements against the Thai government. Because the Pattani Province is located a great distance from the center of the Thai government, the Pattani have developed a feeling of uniqueness and independence. Each time the government tries to centralize control in Pattani Province, the Pattani Malay feel like their independence is threatened. This has resulted in a resentment towards the government, sometimes leading to violent conflict.

**Cuisine**: ***This is just about all of Thai food.*** Thai cooking is ""about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord it's got to have a smooth surface but it doesn't matter what's happening underneath. Simplicity isn't the dictum here, at all."" Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: *tom* (boiled dishes), *yam* (spicy salads), *tam* (pounded foods), and *kaeng* (curries). Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from Chinese cuisine. A typical Thai meal includes five main flavors: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy. Indeed, most Thai dishes are not considered satisfying unless they combine all five. While the seasoning can be spicy for a foreign palate, Thai food ensures that a balance of all flavors is present. Nothing occupies a more prominent place in Thai cuisine than rice. The most served dish in all meals, rice is treated with respect and never wasted. *Guay teow* is arguably one of the most popular Thai dishes and can be found almost everywhere. *Guay teow* describes any type of noodle soup. It can be made with chicken, pork, or beef (rarely vegetarian-friendly) as well as either rice noodles or egg noodles. Tom Yum Goong (Spicy Shrimp Soup) is another wildly popular dish in Thailand. *Tom yum goong* is created with quintessential Thai ingredients like lemongrass, chilli, galangal, kaffier lime leaves, shallots, fresh lime juice and plenty of fish sauce. *Tom kha gai* is related to *tom yum* and offers people with a lower tolerance to spice the opportunity to have a taste of beautiful Thai flavours. Besides the spice scale, *Tom kha gai* is also unique in that it typically comes with lots of creamy coconut milk creating a rich sweet soup. Like most Thai foods, vegetarian options are easily adaptable by substituting a few ingredients. *Som tam* hails from Isaan in Northeastern Thailand and is one of the most popular dishes in Thailand. Som tam comes in a variety of styles, however, the classic *som tam* consists of shredded green papaya, tomatoes, carrots, peanuts, dried shrimp, runner beans, palm sugar, tamarind pulp, fish sauce, lime juice, garlic and plenty of chillies. The ingredients are mixed together using a mortar and pestle, which amplifies the flavours into a super moreish dish. *Laab* is a northeastern-style salad with meat or mushroom and mint which originates in the northeastern province of Isan. *Laab* comes in a variety of styles including chicken, pork, and mushroom. It is not recommended for those who can’t handle spice as it tends to come with a hefty kick. *Pad thai* is one of Thailands national dishes and is a go-to for tourists who are starting out their Thai cuisine exploration. *Pad thai* is a fried noodle dish which is usually made with shrimp or chicken, however, the vegetarian option is popular too. *Pad thai* is available on almost every corner that serves street food and is a cheap and tasty meal. *Pad See Eiw* (Thick Noodle Dish) is another dish, it consists of wide rice noodles which are stir-fried in thick dark soy sauce with chicken, pork, or beef as well as either Chinese broccoli or cabbage. *Pad krapao* usually is made using minced pork or chicken (it’s also great with tofu) which is stir-fried with Thai basil and plenty of chillies. *Pad krapow* is definitely not a dish for picky eaters: The Thai basil has a very sharp, peppery flavour, while the chillies add a hefty dose of spice. Of course Thailand is also full of curries, from penang to masaman to green curry!

# Prayer Request:

* Pray for God's peace in southern Thailand.  
* Pray that the Holy Spirit will reveal Christ to Pattani Malay leaders.  
* Pray that they will soon accept the blessings of Christ for their families.  
* Pray that God the Son, Jesus Christ, will come to Pattani Malay leaders in dreams.  
* Ask the Lord to raise up persons of peace among the Pattani Malay who will receive the gospel and pass it to many others.
* Pray for a movement to Christ that will bless them with spiritual wholeness for eternity!
* Pray for Holy Spirit anointed workers to go to them, taking Jesus, the Bread of Life.
* Pray that strong local churches will be raised up among the Hadrami.
* Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News.

*Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*

b - Russia/Turkey/etc is Europe but also Asia so...

c - this likely is not the true religion that they worship, but rather they have a mixture of what is listed with other local religions, or they have embraced a postmodern drift and are leaving faith entirely but this is their historical faith.

SCREENRANT:

""Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has yet to introduce the iconic Star Trek: The Original Series character, Hikaru Suku, who could be the perfect rival for Lt. Erica Ortegas (Melissa Navia). As a prequel to TOS, Strange New Worlds has introduced updated versions of beloved characters alongside some great new faces. From Celia Rose Gooding's Lt. Nyota Uhura to Christina Chong's Lt. La'an Noonien-Singh, Strange New Worlds has done an excellent job casting Star Trek characters both old and new. [...]

Sulu has yet to pop up on Strange New Worlds, but he would make an excellent rival for Pike's USS Enterprise pilot, Lt. Ortegas.

Why Sulu Would Be The Perfect Rival For Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ Ortegas 

Mr. Sulu filled many different roles throughout his Star Trek career, but he was best known for being a highly skilled pilot. Sulu was also a swashbuckler at heart, and a rivalry with Ortegas would likely bring out his competitive side. Not only is Ortegas one of the best pilots in Starfleet, but she also has a competitive spirit and enjoys performing difficult flight maneuvers. Erica has not gotten as much character development on Strange New Worlds as some of her friends aboard the USS Enterprise, and a rivalry with a new hotshot pilot would allow the show to explore more about her.

Sulu and Ortegas are both fun characters, and it would be incredibly entertaining watching them compete with one another to see who is the better starship pilot. From serving on the USS Enterprise to commanding the USS Excelsior, Sulu has one of Star Trek's most impressive and celebrated careers. Despite this, not much has been revealed about his life before the Enterprise. Strange New Worlds has the opportunity to dive into Sulu's backstory, perhaps showing him as the helmsman of another Starfleet ship, such as the USS Farragut alongside Lieutenant James T. Kirk (Paul Wesley).

[...]

As Strange New Worlds' timeline moves closer and closer to the beginning of Star Trek: The Original Series, it seems inevitable that Sulu and Bones will appear. Star Trek has revealed a few hints about Dr. McCoy's life before the Starship Enterprise, but Strange New Worlds could explore more about his early Starfleet days. Whether or not Sulu or McCoy become major characters on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, they should make at least a cameo appearance before the series comes to an end, and Sulu vs. Ortegas would be natural rivals.""

For example, he knows he already has True Form, so he trades off having to do three steps to avoid having to use hand signs once, so if you only have two arms, you can't use it in the future. But Sukuna knows he still has a four-armed form.

And the Furnace is a slow move without very much range. Therefore, as a sacrifice, Sukuna can't use it when he's outnumbered unless he opens his domain to make it really good.

Sukuna's trade off to overcome Fuga's weaknesses is that he isn't allowed to use it when it's really shitty against multiple people.

Oh, and there's the trade off where he uses BV to increase the range of the Malevolent Shrine in exchange for allowing his opponent to escape. But you know, Open Domain can already escape because it doesn't have a barrier, so it's not like he's losing anything using BV for this, and it's not like you'll be able to escape because before you know it, you're dead.

I think he's really smart about using it. I think even using BV requires knowledge of it, by thinking about what to exchange with the least damage to you, otherwise it will be like Miwa...."

sori kelupaan, tp tglnya di gambar yang paling kiri itu Q1 2021, yang paling kanan Q3 2024  
  
Semenjak patrick menjadi ceo GoTo, revenue growth yoy turun (karena penjualan tokped ke tiktok juga ofc) tetapi minus operating margin mengecil

I'm very bullish and 650 million idr deep in GoTo shares

INI SEMUA OPINI SAYA, OFC BISA SALAH, DYOR

Pro:

1. GoTo menempati posisi paling strategis mengenai transformasi digital Indonesia, dari tencent, alibaba semua perusahaan asing kalau mau kerja sama mengenai cloud, fintech, big data, AI pasti kerja sama dengan GoTo
2. Saham sudah jatuh 80% dari IPO, nilai market cap 5.7B, ps 5.68, Pb 2.76. Semua nilai ini diatas metric value investing tapi ini tergolong murah untuk perusahaan tech growth
3. Ceo GoTo, Patrick walujo punya track record bagus, mertuanya pemimpin astra. astra invest tinggi di GoTo, Patrick walujo yang punya northstar, dia juga pemicu jenius dan bank jago dan juga early investor di Gojek. dan juga yg pemicu Gojek tokopedia merger. Menurut saya dia orang yang sangat pintar dan kompeten
4. Suku Bunga RI di 6% ini bullish karena, there's no way they're gonna raise the rate anymore, it will only go down from here
5. Balance sheet masih cukup sehat, Q3 2024, Debt ( current liabilities + long term debt) = 12 T, Cash 20 T
6. Dillution is not bad, Q4 2021, shares 1.143.748.873.502. Q3 2024, shares 1.201.409.662.836

Cons:

1. Founder left, semua bisnis growth baik biasa foundernya masih ada.
2. GoTo merupakan stok favorit retail yang merupakan dumb money, tetapi retail indo masih 10% dari 80% ownership dibawah 5%
3. Perusahaan bakar duid. Net cash dan asset mengecil terus tiap kuartal karena perusahaan rugi, operating margin harus pivot menjadi positf tahun depan
4. Kenapa perusahaan bakar duit seperti goto melakukan stock buyback?? I mean it can be bullish karena manajemen meliat stock GoTo saat ini valuasinya murah
5. Pas awal mereka IPO perusahaan cuma issue new shares 4.3% (Insider greedy ga mau didilute). ujung ujungnya terpaksa jual Tokped karena uang yang didapatkan dari IPO kurang memadai.

Saya sih tetap invest untuk jangka panjang, dengan jangka waktu mungkin ini bisa 5-20 tahun paling lama. Saya cuma berharap patrick bisa makin menuntun goto ke arah yang benar

Puran turhautumistani nyt sitten redditin puolelle, mutta jos kenelläkään on antaa neuvoja, arvostan kovasti.

Teen tällä hetkellä ADHD-testejä YTHS:sän puolesta, ja olen siinä vaiheessa kun kerätään paljon tietoa taustastani ja oireilustani. Vanhempieni pitää täyttää kaikenlaisia lappuja sun muuta oireistani lapsuusiältä, mutta he suoraansanoen valehtelevat noissa kyselyissä. Vastaavat periaattessa kaikkiin näihin kysymyksiin että ”ei näy ollenkaan”. Tiedän, että vanhemmat ovat huomanneet ja huomaavat oireluni, mutta he eivät halua hyväksyä sitä, että minulla olisi mahdollisuus olla diagnosoitu ADHD. Olen kärsinyt myös masennuksesta ja ahdistuksesta, joista pääsin yli vasta viime vuoden alussa. Vanhempien mielestä terapia on suurinpirtein turhaa, ja lääkkeitä ei todellakaan tulisi käyttää. Kyllä minä lääkkeitä käytin silti, sain aina vastalauseita äidiltä.

Tänään isäni sanoi minulle ”Ei sinulla mitään ADHD:ta voi olla. Ei meidän suku ole tuollainen, olemme rauhallisia ihmisiä eikä kenelläkään ole mitään tuommoisia ongelmia.” Aika hyvin kuvastaa heidän näkökulmaansa asiaan.

En tietenkään voi olla vielä varma että onko kyseessä ADHD, mutta tuntuu, että vanhempani haluavat oikeasti sabotoida koko prosessia. ADHD-diagnoosin yksi kriteereistä on, että oirelu näkyy lapsuusiässä. Vanhempani ovat puhuneet minulle oirelustani, ja tiedän että he huomaavat ne. Minulla on ollut tic-oireita, levottomuutta, huolimattomuutta ihan nimetäkseni pari juttua, mistä vanhemmat myös  tietävät hyvin. He eivät ole tyhmiä, vain ilkeitä joskus.

En tiedä miten edetä asian kanssa, tuntuu tosi turhautuneelta kun vanhemmat eivät tue minua näissä asioissa. Tuntuu myös siltä, että he vain nyt ”päättävät” että ei minulla maagisesti ole mitään ongelmia, koska kaikkihan on aina hyvin! Ja jos ei ole, niin kyllä on. Olen kyllä vasta 21 vee, joten ehkä tässä on nyt jotain mitä en huomaa. 

Onko kenelläkään neuvoja, miten voisin lähestyä vanhempia? Jutteleminen on vaikeaa, he ovat todella päättäväisiä ihmisiä ja minä kovin pienessä asemassa auktoriteetin takia. Mikä saisi heidät ymmärtämään, että teen tämän itseni vuoksi, eikä mikään diagnoosi ole maailmanloppu?

TL;DR: Olen ADHD-testeissä tällä hetkellä, ja vanhemmat valehtelevat oireilustani. Tuntuu, että he eivät hyväksy sitä, että minulla voisi mahdollisesti olla ADHD, ja laiminlyövät tunteitani asiasta. Tarvitsen neuvoa miten voisin lähestyä tilannetta.

Kisah industri armrest kursi pesawat terbang buatan Indonesia: dari Yudi Supriyono ,indonesia,1h5kq2w,2024-12-03 05:47:53,15,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h5kq2w,Previous_Knowledge91,Automotive/Transportation,"Arm Rest Pesawat Terbang Buatan Indonesia

Oleh Yudi Supriyono

Satu lagi prestasi anak bangsa yang belum banyak diekspos media massa, keberhasilan industri lokal memproduksi arm rest untuk kursi penumpang merk Spectrum di pesawat Boeing B777, B737 dan Airbus A330 dengan kualitas global.

Bagi produsen pesawat terbang, maskapai sebagai pengguna adalah raja. Kelemahan hasil produk, apa pun bentuknya tak bisa lepas dari perhatian. Apalagi kalau hal ini terkait masalah engine, struktur hingga interior pesawat. Khusus yang disebut terakhir ini sangat perlu dipahami bahwa interior pesawat terbang bersifat dinamis, maka perlu sekali memperhatikan banyak faktor mulai dari aspek ergonomi hingga tuntutan regulasi dari otoritas terkait. 

Aspek ergonomi sangat penting, bahkan desainer interior pesawat terbang dituntut mampu menyesuaikan diri dengan tuntutan ergonomi karena berkaitan langsung dengan penumpang yang menjadi pengguna jasa angkutan udara. Bisa dikatakan jika ergonomi tidak terpenuhi bisa menjadi awal timbulnya berbagai masalah lain. 

Merancang dan memproduksi interior pesawat terbang memanq tidak sesederhana membuat interior alat transportasi lain seperti mobil, kereta api, atau kapal laut. Lantaran kondisi wahana dan medan operasinya membutuhkan perlakuan berbeda. Interior pesawat terbang memiliki pendekatan berbeda. Ada ketentuan-ketentuan yang harus diikuti salah satunya seperti regulasi dalam FAR 25 (FAA Amerika Serikat) atau jika di Indonesia merujuk ke CASR 25.

Interior ini menjadi salah satu penentu kenyamanan penumpang, baik dalam penerbangan jarak dekat maupun penerbangan jarak jauh. Maskapai yang menyediakan jasa penerbangan bisa menghadirkan kenyamanan lewat desain kursi penumpang yang tepat. Kursi penumpang ini memiliki beberapa komponen, salah satunya adalah arm rest atau dudukan lengan kursi.

Dari Industri Manufaktur Plywood
Bagi Indonesia, produksi komponen pesawat seperti arm rest ini sebenarnya merupakan suatu peluang untuk menjadi supply chain bagi industri MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul) maupun industri pesawat terbang didalam maupun luar negeri. Dalam jangka pendek, mengingat kebutuhan part arm rest didalam negeri masih bergantung dari produsen luar, maka ini bisa menjadi peluang bagus bagi industri lokal untuk berperan aktif menjadi suplier bagi industri di Tanah Air. 

Arm rest ini memang terkesan sepele, namun perlu diketahui membuat part ini bukanlah pekerjaan mudah. Hal ini diamini Rico Natio, Managing Director PT. Indonesia Polyurethane Industry (PT. IPI) dalam wawancara dengan penulis pada pertengahan Februari silam. 

Perusahaan yang dipimpinnya memang sudah sejak beberapa tahun lalu memproduksi arm rest. Adapun masuknya PT. IPI kedalam industri komponen pesawat terbang tidak datang begitu saja. Berawal pada tahun 1989 sebagai industri manufaktur yang memproduksi suku cadang mesin industri plywood. Dalam waktu singkat perusahaan ini semakin berkembang, pada tahun 1996 misalnya, berhasil mengembangkan dan memproduksi suku cadang berbasis polyurethane, yakni bahan polymeric yang mengandung berbagai kumpulan urethane (-NH-C-O-) yang dihasilkan dari reaksi antara polyol dan isocyanates.

Sejalan dengan perkembangan bisnis dan permintaan yang terus meningkat. Maka pada tahun 2003 nama PT. Indonesia Polyurethane Industry resmi berdiri demi memenuhi kebutuhan akan casted polyurethane untuk aplikasi di berbagai macam industri.

Pada tahun 2014 sejalan dengan telah bergulirnya program pesawat N219, PT. IPI menjadi salah satu dari sekian vendor potensial yang mendapat undangan bimbingan teknis dari PT. Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI). “Awalnya dari situ kita lihat beberapa hal, lalu kita coba explore apakah dunia aviasi ini cukup potensial, akhirnya dari situ kita ikutin terus,” kata alumnus Universitas Tarumanagara tahun 2005 ini. Rico pernah menjadi Business Development Manager PT. IPI, pada periode November 2014-Maret 2021. Dari bulan Maret 2021 sampai saat ini , ia masih dipercaya menjabat sebagai Managing Director PT. IPI.

Ia bercerita bagaimana perjuangan perusahaannya bisa dikatakan tidak mudah. Hingga tahun 2020, satu job dari segmen pesawat terbang komersial masih belum ada satupun yang diraih. Padahal setahun sebelumnya mereka berhasil meraih sertifikasi AS9100D. Ini adalah sertifikasi standar sistem manajemen mutu untuk industri aerospace dunia yang dibangun berdasarkan persyaratan sistem manajemen mutu ISO 9100:2015 dengan menambahkan ketentuan khusus untuk persyaratan Sistem Manajemen Mutu kedirgantaraan.

Tahun-tahun itu memang berat. Ditambah dengan adanya COVID-19, iklim industri kedirgantaraan dunia menjadi tidak sehat, ujung-ujungnya pasar semakin sepi. Tapi dibalik pandemi ada berkah tersendiri. Kebetulan waktu itu ada audiensi dengan PT. GMF Aero Asia Tbk. Direktur GMF kala itu, Pak I Wayan Susena (Juni 2020-Agustus 2021, Pen) memang semangat untuk mencoba beberapa produk yang mungkin bisa di PMA-kan. 

“Akhirnya gak lama dari situ, tim GMF ngirim satu tim banyak ketempat kami bawa banyak sekali contoh part untuk kita review, memang yang akhirnya kita lihat, difokusin akhirnya ke satu part arm rest yang saat ini masih jalan,”, ujar Rico mengenang peristiwa beberapa tahun lalu, seraya menambahkan, ”Yang lainnya itu potensial juga, cuman mungkin dari sisi quantity membuat unit price-nya agak tinggi. Jadi saat itu belum bisa proceed (berjalan).”

Sekedar informasi, arm rest yang dipilih PT. IPI adalah arm rest untuk kursi penumpang merk Spectrum buatan B/E Aerospace yang saat ini masih diadopsi oleh armada pesawat Boeing B777, B737 dan Airbus A330 milik maskapai Garuda Indonesia Airways (GIA).

Kendala Bahan Baku
Berbeda dengan Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) yang rata-rata industrinya sudah mapan dan berjalan puluhan tahun jauh didepan PT. IPI. Bahasa mudahnya mereka tinggal produksi, ini kontras dengan industri lokal yang praktis harus berproses dari nol. Maka ketika hal ini dikaitkan dengan break event point atau titik impas tentu cukup sulit dan sarat dengan tantangan. Persoalannya cukup pelik bagi industri di Indonesia, mereka harus menyediakan tooling yang harganya cukup mahal. Terutama kalau produk injeksi, komposisi karet atau plastik perlu ada molding (pencetakan), yakni teknik manufaktur untuk untuk membentuk bahan mentah menjadi produk tiga dimensi dengan bentuk tertentu menggunakan sebuah cetakan yang disebut mold.

Pertanyaannya apakah tidak ada insentif dari pemerintah? Sejauh ini menurut Rico ada dukungan dari sisi marketing terutama dari sisi pameran melalui Kementerian Perindustrian. Mereka aktif terlibat dengan beberapa kali ikut pameran di Inggris, Jerman, dan Perancis yang konteksnya aviasi.

Terkait development arm rest, memang bisa dipahami jika dalam jangka panjang mereka bisa depresiasi ke produk, hanya saja diawal mereka harus berani mengeluarkan dana sendiri yang cukup besar. Ini cukup beresiko sebenarnya, boleh percaya atau tidak harga molding ini jauh lebih mahal ketimbang mesin. Singkatnya pekerjaan ini dari sisi teknis bisa mereka kerjakan, dari sisi engineering mereka paham, tapi dari sisi komersial memang rada serem. 

Namun pada akhirnya ketakutan ini mereka terabas dengan cara berpikir sederhana: jika project ini tidak dijalankan, selamanya juga tidak akan pernah berjalan. “Ya cukup panjang developmentnya hampir satu tahun, itu akhir 2020, awal 2021 mulai bergulir.”, ungkapnya. 

Kontrak sempat mundur karena menunggu kedatangan bahan baku yang masih harus diimpor. Rico mengakui bahan baku ini menjadi kendala paling berat dan sering ditemui dalam proses development produknya. Mereka masih tergantung impor 100 persen dari negara luar, terutama jika sudah terkait engineering plastic, engineering rubber, dan exotic material, pasti itu impor. 

Persoalan impor ini cukup kompleks. Misalnya dalam proses mendapatkan bahan baku ada semacam “hambatan”. Beberapa supplier terkadang menerapkan MOU dimana ada klausul minimal pembelian. Sebagai contoh supplier yang mereka pakai saat ini sebenarnya bukanlah supplier pilihan pertama. “Ini (suplier) pilihan kedua. Pilihan pertama MOU-nya luar biasa gede pak. Jadi 15 kali dari pada bahan baku yang kita pakai sekarang. Kita hitung-hitung ini sampai 10 tahun lagi juga belum habis (penggunaannya).”, ujar Rico. Padahal bahan baku ini tergolong bahan khusus, selain mahal, juga tidak bisa dipakai untuk industri lain pada umumnya.

Diluar proyek arm rest, kesulitan malah datang bukan hanya soal MOU saja, beberapa supplier misalnya tidak mau menjual bahan baku ke IPI karena mereka ada semacam exclusivity agreement dengan perusahaan lain di Amerika Utara, Jerman, dan lain-lain. Pernah suatu kali mereka mencari material dengan kode tertentu, dari supplier mengatakan tidak memiliki. Tapi lucunya setelah berkeliling ke beberapa negara, representatif mereka di Amerika Tengah malah jujur jujur mengaku tidak bisa mensuplai karena sudah ada exclusivity agreement dengan perusahaan lain di Amerika Utara. Monopoli atau bukan, tapi inilah realita yang terjadi dilapangan.

Pengujian Ketat
Rico bersama timnya sangat berhati-hati agar arm rest buatan mereka bisa memenuhi spesifikasi, serta sesuai aspek regulasi terkait. Tahap awal proses desain arm rest tidak bisa sembarangan karena sangat berpengaruh terhadap ergonomi kursi penumpang. Maka bisa ditebak jika tim ini menghadapi tantangan yang tidak mudah sejak tahap development awal.

Tantangan pertama adalah fitting atau fase pengepasan untuk mencocokan pemasangan produk arm rest ke dudukan asli kursinya. Untuk ini PT. IPI melakukan drawing manual dengan pertimbangan bahwa yang paling akurat biasanya melalui proses manual. Agar menjadi prototipe, drawing manual ini dikombinasikan dengan 3D scan lalu dimasukan ke 3D print. 3D scan ini alat yang berfungsi untuk mengukur objek dengan didukung teknologi laser atau cahaya sehingga dapat menangkap bentuk objek secara akurat. Sedangkan 3D print adalah alat yang digunakan dalam proses pembuatan benda dari sebuah desain digital menjadi bentuk benda padat tiga dimensi.

Pemilihan 3D print ini tak lain agar lebih cepat mendapatkan gambaran wujud benda yang nantinya bisa dilihat dan dipegang. Ketika di pasang ke kursi pesawat juga langsung pas. Setelah prototipe 3D print hasilnya bagus, baru mereka memesan mold (cetakan) ke industri yang membuka jasa pembuatan (mold making). 

Jika diperhatikan, arm rest ini satu part number (P/N) ada dua bagian, yakni bagian luar yang lunak dan bagian dalam yang keras (untuk rangka yang terhubung ke frame). Kedua bagian ini mengadopsi bahan yang berbeda, mold-nya juga berbeda. Maka tidak salah jika Rico berulang kali menyebut bahwa harganya luar biasa mahal karena harus ada dua jenis mold untuk satu P/N yang produknya padahal “hanya” part berukuran kecil.

Untuk pembuatan mold bagian dalam, Rico menggandeng PT. Yogya Presisi Teknikatama Industri (PT. YPTI). Dipilihnya YPTI karena perusahaan asal Jogja ini bersama PT. IPI sama-sama menjadi anggota Indonesia Aircraft and Component Manufacturer Association (INACOM). Rico melihat ini kesempatan yang langka bisa memberdayakan industri komponen pesawat di Indonesia, tentunya sayang jika dilewatkan begitu saja.

Tantangan kedua adalah warna permukaan arm rest. PT. IPI mengadopsi tekstur kulit jeruk yang membuat permukaan arm rest ada “rasa” keset-keset kasar. Nah seperti dikatakan Rico, membuat tekstur kasar berikut warna ini lumayan setengah mati susahnya. Apalagi GMF “hanya” memberikan sample produk arm rest lama, tanpa data pantone number colour karena mereka memang tidak punya data ini, maka bisa dibayangkan sulitnya PT. IPI harus mengira-ngira warna dan menirunya.

Agar lebih mudah, mereka bekerjasama dengan pabrik cat untuk menentukan pantone-nya. Ini dilakukan melalui tes dengan infra red agar keluar spektrum warnanya. Lalu dibuatlah warna khusus. Mereka berkali-kali mencoba trial and eror. Berkali-kali pula customer menolak produk yang dihasilkan mereka sebelum akhirnya produk mereka berhasil diterima. “Jadi salah satu yang paling susah itu warna. Kelihatan sepele sekali, itu habis waktu lumayan banyak, karena itu tidak ada data dokumen warna. Disitu yang agak susah.”, ungkap Rico.

Lepas dari persoalan desain yang rumit dan menguras waktu, fase development tak lantas selesai. Prototipe ternyata masih harus melewati serangkaian pengujian ketat dari DKPPU (Direktorat Kelaikudaraan dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara) sebagai otoritas penerbangan sipil di Indonesia. Ini terkait kebutuhan sertifikasi agar memenuhi standar dan requirement yang ada.

Dalam dunia penerbangan, arm rest ini termasuk kategori produk PMA (Part Manufacturer Approval), yakni produk yang berasal dari pabrikan yang telah mendapat ijin untuk memproduksi suku cadang pengganti untuk pesawat terbang. Meskipun pabrikan ini bukan Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), suku cadang PMA ini dirancang identik dengan suku cadang milik OEM.

Sebagai pemegang sertifikat PMA arm rest ini adalah GMF selaku pemilik sertifikat Design Organization Approval (DOA). Posisi PT. IPI disini sebagai partner layaknya “extended workshop” dan GMF ini yang mengajukan dokumen arm rest ke DKPPU agar bisa menjadi produk PMA. DKPPU pertama kali melakukan audit ke GMF menyangkut administrasi dan lain sebagainya, lanjut ke PT. IPI sebagai tempat produksi. Sebelum DKPPU datang, sebenarnya PT. IPI telah melakukan uji flame test terlebih dahulu terhadap prototipe arm rest di laboratorium uji flame test vertical milik sendiri (inhouse). Pengujian ini untuk memastikan bahwa material yang digunakan sudah memenuhi syarat, sebelum melangkah lebih jauh ke tahapan berikutnya

“Karena ini interior dan di-request untuk flame test, ya kita harus ikuti flame test juga. Memang ada dua sih, 12 detik dan 60 detik biasanya. Cuma yang untuk ini di-request hanya 12 detik saja.”, kata Rico. Lebih jauh Ia mengungkapkan bahwa laboratorium uji miliknya belum tersertifikasi Komite Akreditasi Nasional (KAN) karena memang hanya mereka gunakan untuk development internal. “Sebenarnya flame test kita itu ngikutin kaidah FAR 25.853 sebenarnya, hanya saja kami tidak KAN certified, hanya itu sih.”, sahut Rico.

Disi lain, dari DKPPU sudah mensyaratkan bahwa laboratorium uji flame test yang boleh digunakan minimal harus tersertifikasi oleh KAN atau lembaga akreditasi sejenis diluar negeri. Sayangnya di Indonesia hal itu tidak ada. Mereka mau tidak mau harus ke pihak ketiga di luar negeri yang tersertifikasi oleh lembaga akreditasi plus compliance dengan FAR 25. Mencari laboratorium ini cukup susah, apalagi yang bisa FAR 25 tentunya tidak banyak. Mereka sempat ke JAMCO Singapura, ternyata sudah tutup sejak pandemi COVID-19 dan tidak buka lagi. Sempat juga menghubungi JAMCO pusat di Jepang, tapi sayang mereka tidak punya laboratorium uji flame test.

Waktu berlalu, Tim supply chain PT. IPI harus memutar otak, mencoba banyak cara mulai dari search google hingga bertanya ke rekan-rekan industri. Ada dua laboratorium yang mereka termukan, satu di Belanda dan satu di AS. Mereka cenderung memilih yang terakhir dengan pertimbangan nama yang dianggap lebih bonafide. Perusahaan AS ini adalah SGS North America Inc, yang telah tersertifikasi oleh A2LA (American Association for Laboratory Accreditation) dan mengantongi metode test sesuai FAR 25.853. 

PT. IPI mengirim spesimen ke perusahaan yang berkantor di New York ini untuk di uji. Selesai pengujian, SGS mengirim report-nya yang menyatakan bahwa spesimen ini compliance untuk interior flame 12 detik. Keberhasilan ini membuat lega seluruh tim. Berkat kerja keras dan semangat pantang menyerah, kini produk arm rest buatan PT. IPI layak untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pasar MRO di Indonesia. 

Sebuah Harapan
Dari sisi produksi, PT. IPI tercatat telah memproduksi ribuan pieces arm rest untuk GMF Aero Asia. Rico berani mengkalim harga dari perusahaannya sangat kompetitif, lebih murah dari harga dari OEM atau dari PMA luar. GMF memberikan kontrak pertama selama 3 tahun dari tahun 2021-pertengahan 2024. Ini kontrak pertama. “Tapi dengan kontrak yang sudah berjalan kita dikontrak untuk menjual eksklusif ke GMF”, aku Rico sambil tersenyum. Ia melanjutkan bahwa ini bisa dikecualikan jika customer lain mau membuat molding baru, karena memang ada batasan menggunakan tooling arm rest GMF untuk customer lain selama masa kontrak berjalan.

Hingga saat ini armada pesawat Boeing B777, B737 dan Airbus A330 milik Garuda sudah memakai produk arm rest buatannya. Hanya sayang, Rico tidak tahu pasti untuk customer non Garuda mana saja yang sudah menggunakan produknya lantaran kontrak mereka dengan GMF, sementara GMF memiliki divisi PMA yang bisa menjual arm rest ini keluar, ke maskapai non Garuda.

Hingga kini diakui untuk kandungan lokal arm rest masih terhitung rendah, estimasi masih dibawah 25%. Salah satu tantangan utama adalah masih adanya ketergantungan terhadap bahan baku impor. Maka praktis kontribusi untuk kandungan lokal “hanya” berasal dari man hour, Intellectual Property (IP) dan kepemilikan mesin produksi.

Terlepas dari permasalahan ini, Rico masih menyimpan harapan bahwa kelak ekosistem industri kedirgantaraan di Indonesia bisa lebih berkembang dan maju. “Kalau kita ngomong ekosistem itu kan macam-macam komponennya. Dari sisi bahan baku itu bisa, saya gak muluk muluk, ada kemudahan impor, yang kedua yang paling penting (ada) order.”, jelas Rico yang sangat menyayangkan bahwa Indonesia yang memiliki industri pesawat terbang, namun dari sisi manufaktur komponennya malah tertinggal jauh dari negara-negara tetangga yang notabene malah tidak punya pabrik pesawat. 

Kegalauan ini bukan tanpa sebab, Ia melihat INACOM masih penuh dengan tantangan untuk bisa terjun ke dalam supply chain aviasi global. Ia menekankan anggota organisasi ini sebenarnya tidak perlu banyak-banyak, yang terpenting ada komitmen dan keseriusan dalam membangun industri ini. Apalagi jika melihat capability masing-masing anggota cukup besar. Sayangnya ordernya yang tidak ada. “Klo ada order banyak masalah selesai pak.” Ujar Rico menutup wawancara sambil tertawa.

RUU Perkawinan 1973 yang ditolak karena bertentangan dengan syariat Islam.,indonesia,1h1nlg8,2024-11-27 23:15:09,41,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1h1nlg8/ruu_perkawinan_1973_yang_ditolak_karena/,YukkuriOniisan,Throwback,"Let's do a proper throwback post. Reminder. I am not a historian. My knowledge is just superficial.

So basically sebelum UU 1 1974  tentang Perkawinan (yang kontroversial bagi masyarakat Indonesia saat ini). Pemerintah sempat mengajukan Rancangan Undang-undang Perkawinan ke DPR. Namun RUU ini kandas karena ditolak banyak pihak keagamaan terutama dari kelompok Islam. 

Bunyi RUUnya: https://www.indolaw.de/Texte/RUU%20Perkawinan%201973.html

Poin2 penolakan:

Pertama, RUU ini menganggap sah perkawinan yang tak menurut hukum agama. Cukup didaftarkan ke catatan sipil saja.

> Pasal 2 RUU

> (1) Perkawinan adalah sah apabila dilakukan dihadapan pegawai pencatat perkawinan, dicatatkan dalam daftar pencatat perkawinan oleh pegawai tersebut, dan dilangsungkan menurut ketentuan Undang-undang ini dan/atau ketentuan hukum perkawinan fihak-fihak yang melakukan perkawinan, sepanjang tidak bertentangan dengan Undang-undang ini.

> (2) Pencatatan perkawinan dimaksud dalam ayat (1) pasal ini dilakukan oleh pejabat negara yang diatur lebih lanjut dalam peraturan perundang-undangan tersendiri. 

Kedua, anak angkat punya kedudukan yang sama dengan anak kandung dan putus hubungan dengan keluarga sebelumnya.

> Pasal 62 RUU Perkawinan

> (8) Anak yang diangkat mempunyai kedudukan yang sama seperti anak yang sah dari suami isteri yang mengangkatnya.

> (9) Pengangkatan anak mengakibatkan putusnya hubungan keluarga antara anak yang diangkat dengan keluarganya sedarah dan semenda garis keatas dan kesamping.

Ketiga, adanya larangan perkawinan dengan hubungan anak angkat atau bapak angkat.

> Pasal 8 RUU Perkawinan

> Perkawinan dilarang antara dua orang yang:

> c. berhubungan sebagai anak angkat dan orang tua angkat atau anak-anak dari orang tua angkat;

Keempat, perbedaan agama tidak menjadi penghalang perkawinan.

> Pasal 11 RUU Perkawinan

 > (1) Pada azasnya perkawinan yang dianut menurut Undang-undang ini adalah perkawinan berdasarkan sistim parental.

> (2) Perbedaan karena kebangsaan, suku bangsa, negara asal, tempat asal, agama/kepercayaan dan keturunan, tidak merupakan penghalang perkawinan.

RUU Perkawinan juga menghilangkan ketentuan dan kewenangan pengadilan agama untuk menangani kasus keluarga Muslim. Pengadilan agama sendiri dianggap sebagai simbol otoritas Muslim dalam menjamin penerapan hukum Islam, dan penghilangan tersebut dianggap mengancam urusan keagamaan.

Ini menimbulkan banyak pertentangan terutama di kalangan Muslim dan mahasiswa Muslim. 

Pikiran Rakyat edisi 29 September 1973 melaporkan pada saat, Menteri Agama Mukti Ali hampir selesai membacakan jawaban pemerintah tentang RUU Perkawinan di depan DPR, tiba-tiba saja seorang pemuda di balkon belakang berteriak menuntut dicabutnya RUU Perkawinan. Ia berusaha membuka kemejanya, dan mengeluarkan kertas bertuliskan kecaman terhadap RUU Perkawinan. Menteri pun berhenti berpidato.

Sekitar 400-500 anak muda, seperempatnya pelajar putri berkerudung putih berteriak-teriak. Kelompok anak muda yang duduk di bawah, di tengah-tengah anggota DPR segera menyambut dengan pekikan-pekikan menuntut dicabutnya RUU Perkawinan. Mereka inj berasal dari kelompok Attahiriyah, Gerakan Mahasiswa Islam Indonesia (GMII), dan ormas Islam lainnya.

Sebelum peristiwa ini sebenarnya GMII dan Kesatuan Aksi Umat Islam (KAUI) telah berupaya berdialog dengan Presiden Soeharto, namun mengalami kegagalan. 

Sidang yang dipimpin Wakil Ketua DPR Domo Pranoto pun akhirnya diskors sementara. Para pejabat yang hadir, antara lain pimpinan DPR, Menteri Agama, Menteri Kehakiman Oemar Senoadji, dan anggota DPR lainnya diselamatkan ke ruang tunggu VIP.

Situasi mencekam di dalam ruang sidang DPR. Para demonstran lalu menyerbu ke mimbar pimpinan DPR. Spanduk kecil mereka acungkan, di antaranya tertulis, “sekularisme dan komunisme adalah musuh negara Pancasila.”

Setengah jam kemudian, Ketua DPR Idham Chalid datang dan menenangkan para demonstran. Namun, hal itu sia-sia. Ia pun meninggalkan ruang sidang.

https://www.alinea.id/nasional/gerakan-massa-menolak-ruu-perkawinan-pada-1973-b1XmM9nAI

Nah. Selain karena memang RUU Perkawinan 1973 ini ujungnya dipangkas jadi UU Perkawinan 1974, momen demonstrasi mahasiswa RUU perkawinan ini menjadi cikal bakal demonstrasi menentang investasi asing yang ujung-ujungnya.... MALARI 1974.

Funny how a demonstration against marriage law turned into a bigger demonstration.

So yeah... How's that for a historical throwback?"

How did Sukuna's plan change and evolve?,Jujutsufolk,1h0c91l,2024-11-26 08:47:11,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jujutsufolk/comments/1h0c91l/how_did_sukunas_plan_change_and_evolve/,rumun2,Manga Discussion,"Sukuna was eyeing Megumi as a vessel since the Cursed Womb arc, but at that point he likely wasn't aware of Uraume, nor Kenjaku

In Shibuya, he comes across Uraume and initially doesn't recognize them, though there's one thing that confuses me. In spite of that, he still tells Uraume to not neglect their preparations, as if they were already in the know about the bath plan despite it being the first meeting in the modern era.

Then we obviously have the Culling Games, where not much happens until the Yorozu reveal, aka the Gege gifted perfect opportunity for Sukuna to pull off the swap. I doubt Sukuna knew Tsumiki was incarnated considering he didn't immediately recognize Uraume either.

I wonder - was Sukuna just going to wait patiently at the opportunity to have Megumi's soul broken no matter how long? What would he do if Jujutsu High got all of the fingers and Yuji was to be executed? Would he just switch into Megumi regardless of broken soul or not?

With Culling Games in mind, if Tsumiki is actually just an awakened player and not a Sukuna simp from 1000 years ago, what does Sukuna do then? There's a sorcerer with a technique that can kill him and Yuji was willing to make Angel/Hana off him. Does he also gamble the switch there? 

I think regardless if Tsumiki is 'dead' or not, he still switches at that moment. There's no broken soul clause, but Sukuna ingesting 16 fingers worth of himself into Megumi should at least give him a temporary control over the body. Afterwards its Wuraume coming in to clutch and quickly dipping to take the bath. Potentially Sukuna may try to kill Tsumiki right after the swap to break Megumi and that may have worked just as killing Yorozu did canon

...or not and Megumi becomes a problem later on for Suku against say... Gojo"

Sinustakin voi tulla pakolainen,Suomi,1gyp88r,2024-11-24 06:47:46,0,0.25,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suomi/comments/1gyp88r/sinustakin_voi_tulla_pakolainen/,times_a_changing,Vakava,"Kun maailman tilanne pahentuu, sodan mahdollisuus kasvaa ja pakolaisia tulee olemaan maailmanlaajuisesti enemmän on tärkeää huomioida, ettei länsimaalaiset ole immuuneja niille asioille, jotka tekee ihmisestä pakolaisen. Asuit sitten Suomessa, Puolassa, Saksassa, Yhdysvalloissa tai missään muualla tahansa länsimaissa, niin sota, nälkä, vainot ja muut kauhut voivat pakottaa sinutkin lähtemään pakoon ja etsimään turvallista paikkaa perheellesi.

Pakolaisuus on asia, jota kukaan ei koskaan valitse vapaaehtoisesti. Olisiko sinun helppo jättää jälkeen kaikki muistosi, lapsuuden lempipaikkasi, ystävät, suku, koti, työpaikka, koulutus ja muut elämän asiat jotka ovat juurruttaneet sinut kotimaahasi? Jos vastaus on tähän ei, ja sanoisin että hyvin harva vastaisi tuohon kysymykseen positiivisesti, niin pystyt ymmärtämään minkälaisessa tilanteessa pakolaiset ovat.

Sekä media että valtavirta näyttää ymmärtävän, että pakolaiset ovat jotenkin itse valinneet ihan huvin vuoksi pistää sekä oman että perheen elämän kansojen käsiin, jotka eivät heitä sinne halua tai pyytäneet tulla. Pakolaisuus on määritelmällisesti pakotettu tilanne, jota ihminen ei valinnut itse tai halunnut. Oletko sitä mieltä, että Ruotsin tai muiden läheisten maiden pitäisi sodan aikana ottaa suomalaisia pakolaisia vastaan, vaikkei he heitä haluaisi tai pyytäneet tulla? Vai oletko oikeasti sitä mieltä, ettei pakolaisilla ole oikeutta turvaan uhan ajaksi, vaikka kyseessä olisi omat sukulaiset ja ystävät jotka olisivat vaarassa?

Tietysti löytyy niitä opportunisteja, jotka yrittävät hyväksikäyttää järjestelmiä, joiden tarkoitus ei ole auttaa heitä koska he eivät sitä järjestelmää tarvitse. Samaa voisi sanoa niistä järjestelmistä, joita ihan valkoiset kantasuomalaiset hyväksikäyttää kyynisesti vaikkei ansaitsisi niitä. Ei niiden olemassaolo tarkoita, etteikö reilusti suurin osa tukien nostajista ansaitsisi saamaansa apua. Ratkaisu tukien tai pakolaislakien hyväksikäyttöön ei ole se, että kusemme kaikkien päälle riippumatta siitä, että ansaitsevatko he oikeasti apua vai eivät. Suurin osa apua hakevista ihmisistä ansaitsevat sitä apua, koska suurin osa ihmisistä ei halua pyytää apua elleivät sitä tarvitse. Tämä on pitkän päälle universaali totuus.

Joten pidä mielessä tulevien vuosien ja vuoskymmenien aikana se, miten puhuit pakolaisista nyt. Kuka tahansa meistä voi joutua tulevaisuudessa pakolaiseksi. Jos ja kun tämä tapahtuu ja olet nyt pakolaisia vastaan riippumatta tilanteista tai avuntarpeesta, niin et voi valittaa, jos sinua ja rakkaitasi kaltoinkohdellaan maailmalla. Olit itse osallinen pakolaisvastaisen ilmapiirin luomiseen. Olemme loppujen lopuiksi niitä, jotka päättäävät minkälaisessa maailmassa me yhdessä eletään. Haluatko oikeasti elää maailmassa, jossa turvaa tarvitsevat ihmiset eivät sitä saa hakea?"
Things would change in the sumo arc to make it good (with spoilers),Grapplerbaki,1gxar7r,2024-11-22 10:44:23,24,0.91,6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxar7r,ChemicalRelative4428,Baki Dou,"Characters 

The worst thing about this arc are the characters, morally speaking, they were totally wasted and I'm going to mention some ways for them to be good: 

1st- It would improve Sukune in terms of personality, making him less arrogant and imbecile. 

2st- It would give memeriated victories to Sukune and Kehaya, it would remove all of Skune's fights that occur after Jack vs Sukune (e.g. Baki vs Sukune 2), it would remove Yujiro vs Sukune and give more victories to Kehaya (it would make one or another old character come back stronger, he defeats some sumos that appeared in that tournament of sumo wrestlers vs. Warriors of the Subterranean Arena, he even arrives at Kehaya and takes a beating him or a nice and fierce fight

Rivalry between Sukune and Kehaya and more from the past

 I would come back with this idea of ​​Kehaya and Sukune being mortal enemies because of the past. I would show other little things about their lineage.

Removal of useless blablabla 

I would romove some boring, useless and unremarkable scenes from the arc

Honoo and Kehaya
 I would take more advantage of Honoo by giving him some more cans, making his battle against Baki more fun and showing more of his story, along with showing more of Kehaya (just a few achievements and bringing his rivalry with Sukune back)

ACCOMPLISHMENTS/Techniques

 Well in this topic I'm referring to Sukune's feat of turning coal into diamonds with his grip. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, because if he can do it, why when he goes to fight doesn't he squeeze his opponent's arm or any other limb? (he could easily achieve this) and the Pull (that technique that uses the opponent's bones like Mawashi) he only managed to use very few times in the entire work!! There is little diversity of techniques and most of them are barely used and poorly written... Dude can transform coal into diamonds, but when it comes to practical use, it rarely works. To make the new techniques in this arc minimally cool, I would add more diversity and buff this Sukune technique.

Doppo Vs Kehaya

 It would change the outcome of this battle, it would make Kehaya beat Doppo with mid diff and both would be seriously injured from this confrontation

Sukune vs Oliva 

I would modify the first battle between them to make it cooler and more balanced. I would remove the rematch




I hope you liked it (sorry for the last post)

"I'm Not Supporting Hiking VAT to 12%, but It Won't Doom Our Economy.",indonesia,1gwdsog,2024-11-21 06:08:05,338,0.92,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1gwdsog/im_not_supporting_hiking_vat_to_12_but_it_wont/,kelincikerdil,Current Affair,"Belakangan ini, isu kenaikan PPN menjadi 12% menjadi perbincangan populer di kalangan netizen. Di Twitter, muncul ajakan untuk memboikot produk-produk terkena PPN untuk menentang kebijakan ini. Serikat buruh sendiri juga akan berdemo untuk menentang kenaikan PPN.

Saya juga tidak setuju terhadap kenaikan PPN. Namun, saya juga tidak percaya kalau kenaikan PPN ini akan mengkiamatkan ekonomi Indonesia. Bisa disimak pembahasan saya di bawah.

# Pengecualian PPN

Sebelum membahas dampak dari kenaikan PPN sih, kita juga harus mengetahui apa saja barang dan jasa yang tidak terkena PPN terlebih dahulu: [https://www.kompas.id/baca/ekonomi/2024/03/13/tidak-semua-barang-dan-jasa-kena-tarif-ppn-12-persen-belanjamu-kena](https://www.kompas.id/baca/ekonomi/2024/03/13/tidak-semua-barang-dan-jasa-kena-tarif-ppn-12-persen-belanjamu-kena)

1. Barang kebutuhan pokok yang sangat dibutuhkan oleh rakyat banyak, yaitu beras, kedelai, jagung, sagu, garam, daging, telur, susu, buah-buahan, dan sayur-sayuran.
2. Makanan-minuman di restoran, hotel, dan tempat makan lainnya (tbf mereka kena PB1 maksimal 10%)
3. Transaksi uang, emas batangan, dan surat berharga, seperti saham dan obligasi, di pasar keuangan
4. Barang hasil pertambangan, penggalian, dan pengeboran yang diambil langsung dari sumbernya. Misalnya, minyak mentah (*crude oil*), gas bumi (tidak termasuk elpiji yang sudah siap dikonsumsi masyarakat), panas bumi, dan bijih mineral hasil tambang yang belum diolah.
5. Jasa kegiatan pelayanan kesehatan medis
6. Jasa pelayanan sosial
7. Jasa pendidikan
8. Jasa kesenian dan hiburan (kena PBJT maks 10%, kecuali karaoke, bar, diskotik, klub malam, dan spa 40%-70%)
9. Jasa angkutan umum
10. Jasa keagamaan
11. Jasa keuangan
12. Jasa asuransi
13. Jasa penyiaran (yang tidak bersifat iklan)
14. Jasa tenaga kerja (misalnya perhotelan, penyediaan tempat parkir, dan katering, semua kena pajak daerah)
15. Pelaku usaha dengan omzet <Rp4,8M per tahun

Selain itu, PPN untuk UMKM di UU HPP diatur berkisar 1-3% saja.

# Pengeluaran Masyarakat

Mari kita lihat pengeluaran masyarakat menurut data yang telah dihimpun BPS:

[https://www.bps.go.id/id/statistics-table/1/OTM3IzE=/persentase-pengeluaran-rata-rata-per-kapita-sebulan-menurut-kelompok-barang--indonesia--1999--2002-2023.html](https://www.bps.go.id/id/statistics-table/1/OTM3IzE=/persentase-pengeluaran-rata-rata-per-kapita-sebulan-menurut-kelompok-barang--indonesia--1999--2002-2023.html)

[https://www.bps.go.id/id/statistics-table/3/VTJaSFFtWklXVnBYZVdSREwyczJlbm93UWpVM1FUMDkjMw==/rata-rata-pengeluaran-per-kapita-sebulan-menurut-kelompok-komoditas-dan-daerah-tempat-tinggal--rupiah---2022.html?year=2023](https://www.bps.go.id/id/statistics-table/3/VTJaSFFtWklXVnBYZVdSREwyczJlbm93UWpVM1FUMDkjMw==/rata-rata-pengeluaran-per-kapita-sebulan-menurut-kelompok-komoditas-dan-daerah-tempat-tinggal--rupiah---2022.html?year=2023)

Untuk tahun 2023:

>**Makanan & minuman = 48,99%**

>**Perumahan dan fasilitas rumahtangga = 26,69%**

>Barang dan jasa = 12,23%

>Pakaian, alas kaki, dan tutup kepala = 2,48%

>Barang-barang tahan lama = 3,80%

>Pajak dan asuransi = 4,00%

>Keperluan pesta dan upacara = 1,80%

Pengeluaran terbesar adalah pengeluaran untuk makanan & minuman. Secara umum, makanan & minuman tidak terkena PPN, kecuali makanan kemasan serta makanan yang dijual di tempat yang tidak termasuk tempat makan (misal toko roti yang tidak memiliki tempat duduk).

Pengeluaran berikutnya adalah perumahan dan fasilitas rumahtangga. Apabila sebuah rumah tangga mengontrak, maka tidak ada PPN yang dikenakan. Apabila rumah tangga memiliki tempat tinggal, dugaan saya pengeluaran yang termasuk berkenaan dengan listrik dan air. Listrik dikenakan PPN apabila minimal daya 6.600 Watt. Token listrik sendiri PPN tidak dibebankan ke konsumen. Sementara, air bersih dibebaskan dari PPN berdasarkan PP 49/2022.

**Dari dua paragraf di atas, 75% dari pengeluaran masyarakat sendiri cenderung tidak terdampak PPN. Belum kita bicara pengeluaran lain, seperti pengeluaran untuk kesehatan dan pendidikan yang tidak kena PPN. Atau BBM, walaupun dikenakan PPN, harga BBM sendiri lebih dipengaruhi oleh kondisi global, stok dalam negeri, serta subsidi pemerintah. Sebagai perbandingan, Malaysia dan Vietnam mengenakan PPN untuk makanan (termasuk belum diolah). Banyak negara yang sembako hingga jasa pendidikan tidak dikecualikan dari PPN.**

1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, dan 10 tidak terkena PPN maka saya hanya akan memakai 2, 4, 7, dan 11 (3, 8, dan 10 kena Pajak Daerah).

Sekarang di bawah saya lampirkan data inflasi 2022 ya berurutan berdasarkan bulan.

Bisa cek untuk bulan April. Kategori ""Pakaian dan Alas Kaki"" dan ""Informasi, Komunikasi, dan Jasa Keuangan"" tidak mengalami kenaikan inflasi. Kategori ""Perlengkapan, Peralatan, dan Pemeliharaan Rutin Rumah Tangga"" dan ""Perawatan Pribadi dan Jasa Lainnya"" mengalami kenaikan inflasi pada April 2022, namun melambat pada bulan-bulan seterusnya.

Atau kita pakai data inflasi inti: https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/core-inflation-rate.

Inflasi inti = inflasi tidak termasuk pangan dan energi. Inflasi inti ada karena harga pangan dan energi cenderung fluktuatif, sangat bergantung pada faktor seperti cuaca hingga kondisi global. Untuk kasus ini, saya memakai inflasi inti untuk melihat pengaruh kenaikan PPN pada tahun 2022 sendiri.

[Grafik Inflasi Inti Indonesia 2009-Juli 2024 \(tradingeconomics.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/6a7a3u0rf82e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3144f96a54009521c3cd2cae4bc9135400bd32)

Terdapat kenaikan inflasi MoM pada bulan April 2022. Namun, inflasi tersebut turun pada bulan Mei dan Juni 2022.

Funfact: kalau dilihat berdasarkan YoY secara jangka panjang, inflasi inti kita bahkan lebih rendah dibandingkan 2015 dan sebelumnya. Walaupun ini bisa saja karena kenaikan upah sudah ditekan biar tidak tinggi lagi.

# Kesimpulan

Apakah kenaikan PPN menjadi 12% bisa berpengaruh terhadap daya beli? Bisa.

Apakah dampaknya besar? Melihat begitu banyak pengecualian PPN serta berkaca dari 2022, saya tidak yakin.

Apakah kenaikan PPN akan menjadi ""kiamat"" ekonomi Indonesia? Jelas tidak.

Saya pribadi lebih percaya penurunan daya beli dipengaruhi oleh tiga faktor besar, yaitu:

1. COVID-19 yang mengikis pekerjaan formal serta mengakibatkan restrukturisasi supply chain global.
2. Perang Rusia-Ukraina 2022 yang mengakibatkan kenaikan harga BBM serta kenaikan suku bunga sampai hari ini.
3. El Nino 2023 yang mengakibatkan harga makanan naik.

Selain itu, masih banyak sekali variabel dalam ekonomi selain pajak, seperti regulasi bisnis, suku bunga, infrastruktur, dan sebagainya.

Bonus grafik:

Dari grafik di atas, pada tahun 2022, terdapat kenaikan penerimaan lewat PPN yang signifikan. Meskipun demikian, harus analisis juga mengingat 2022 adalah tahun di mana masyarakat sudah meninggalkan PPKM COVID-19.

**Edit 17 Desember 2024 (26 hari setelah post):**

Banyak yang berargumentasi bahwa kenaikan PPN tetap akan berdampak terhadap harga barang tidak kena PPN semenjak pengangkutan logistik terkena PPN.

PPN untuk pengangkutan barang adalah 10% dari PPN normal. Karena PPN sekarang adalah 11% (tahun depan 12%), maka PPN untuk jasa distribusi sendiri adalah 1,1% yang akan naik menjadi 1,2% pada tahun depan, kenaikan 0,1%.

Dan pembayaran PPN sendiri tidak berantai seperti yang diduga banyak pihak. Pasal 9 ayat 4b menjelaskan bahwa kelebihan PPN dapat dikembalikan. (thanks to u/YukkuriOniisan karena menemukan ini).

Sama tentang PPN UMKM 1-3%, ternyata PMK-nya belum keluar. Saya tidak tahu bagaimana praktiknya di lapangan. Apabila ada komodo yang UMKM-nya sudah terdaftar, bisa bercerita apakah PPN 1-3% ini ada atau tidak."

Oath Stone Sogit om Monolibabou ,Sabah,1gtcchb,2024-11-17 07:18:18,4,0.7,0,https://youtu.be/SvNs4uBdwV4?si=QKCuZIK0Uju3wqv_,Confident-Doubt-9263,Sukung YouTuber Sabahan,"Hello guys i would like to share a youtube video link from one of my friend from Tamparuli. He recorded a Ritual Video happened in his Kampung 3 weeks ago. This is a traditional ritual of the Suang Lotud/Dusun Lotud people there. In modern time today this ritual is still been uphold within their community. I hope this will bring some education to us all as a sabahan. here are some descriptions in English, 华文, BM. 



Assalamualaikum and Warm Greetings to All,

This video presents a sacred ritual from the Dusun tribes of Sabah, specifically the Suang Lotud or Dusun Lotud community in the Tuaran District. Known as Sogit and Monolibabou, this ritual holds profound cultural importance.

The Sogit ritual, or Monogit, is a traditional “cooling compensation” ceremony conducted by a Tantagas (bobohizan or shaman) to soothe any angered spirits and restore harmony between the spiritual and physical realms. This ceremony was deemed necessary following renovations to the Oath Stone, during which it was moved from its original resting place. In line with ancestral beliefs, such changes may have disturbed the spirit traditionally believed to guard the stone, making offerings crucial to regain its favor and preserve the stone’s protective role.

Before presenting these offerings, a preliminary ritual called Monolibabou is conducted. Here, an Asug Tantagas reaches out to the spiritual realm to locate the spirit and guide it back to Sampaping/Libabou (Kayangan or Heavens) after it was disrupted during the renovations. Throughout this ritual, a sacred chant, or Rinait, is recited in an ancient language known as the language of Kinorohingan (the Gods). This primordial language, believed to date back to the beginning of time, is spoken to honor the ancestors’ wisdom and invoke divine presence, preserving the peace and sanctity of the Oath Stone.


History of the Kauluan Oath Stone

 • Initially, Kauluan Village faced significant unrest as it was frequently targeted by attacks from Dusun tribes originating from the Tambunan and Menggatal districts, as well as surrounding hills.
 • Conflicts ensued between the villagers of Kauluan and the invading tribes, leading to considerable casualties on both sides.
 • Many of the fallen were beheaded, and their heads were taken home as symbols of heroism, valor, and honor in battle.
 • British colonization in the late 1800s and mid-1900s brought security to Kauluan Village, as modern weaponry like guns and bombs were used to deter the frequent tribal attacks.
 • On April 14, 1956, a peace gathering was held among the chiefs and warriors of the warring tribes, where they drank each other’s blood and vowed to end hostilities permanently, extending this promise to include all Dusun tribes in the Tuaran district.
 • A sacred oath was spoken: “Whoever utters abusive or insulting words that incite anger and conflict between both sides will be cursed, affecting their children and grandchildren.”
 • To commemorate this reconciliation, a stone the size of a human head was planted at the site of the peace agreement.
 • This stone, known as the “Batu Sumpah” or “Tugu Muhibbah,” now stands in front of the Multipurpose Hall in Kauluan Village, Tuaran, Sabah.

BM&中文

Assalamualaikum, 并向所有人致以热烈的问候，

这段视频展示了沙巴杜顺部落，特别是斗亚兰地区 Suang Lotud 或 Dusun Lotud 社区的神圣仪式。该仪式被称为 Sogit 和 Monolibabou，具有深远的文化意义。

Sogit 仪式或 Monogit 是一种传统的“冷却补偿”仪式，由 Tantagas（bobohizan 或萨满）主持，旨在抚慰愤怒的灵魂并恢复精神与物质领域的和谐。在对誓言石进行翻修后，这一仪式被认为是必要的，因为誓言石在翻修期间被从其原本的安息地移走。根据祖先的信仰，这种变动可能扰乱了传统上守护石头的灵魂，因此通过祭祀重新获得灵魂的青睐并保持石头的保护作用至关重要。

在献上这些祭品之前，要进行一项名为 Monolibabou 的初步仪式。在这里，Asug Tantagas 进入精神世界寻找灵魂，并将其引导回 Sampaping/Libabou（Kayangan 或天堂），因为翻修期间灵魂可能被扰动。仪式过程中，人们用古老语言吟诵神圣的圣歌，即 Kinorohingan（众神之语）。这种原始语言被认为可以追溯到时间的开端，人们用它来纪念祖先的智慧，祈求神灵的临在，以保持誓言石的和平与神圣。

Kauluan 誓言石的历史

	•	最初，Kauluan 村面临严重的动荡，经常受到来自 Tambunan 和 Menggatal 地区以及周边山区 Dusun 部落的袭击。
	•	Kauluan 村民与入侵部落之间发生了冲突，双方伤亡惨重。
	•	许多阵亡者被斩首，头颅被带回作为英雄主义、英勇和荣誉的象征。
	•	19 世纪末到 20 世纪中期的英国殖民统治为 Kauluan 村带来了安全，现代武器如枪支和炸弹被用来阻止频繁的部落袭击。
	•	1956 年 4 月 14 日，交战部落的酋长和战士们举行了一场和平集会，彼此喝下对方的血，发誓永久结束敌对，并将这一承诺扩展到斗亚兰地区的所有杜顺部落。
	•	宣誓内容为：“任何人若说出辱骂或侮辱性的话，煽动双方的愤怒和冲突，都将受到诅咒，影响他们的子孙后代。”
	•	为纪念这次和解，在和平协议签署地竖立了一块人头大小的石头。
	•	这块石头被称为“Batu Sumpah”或“Tugu Muhibbah”，现位于沙巴斗亚兰 Kauluan 村多功能厅前。

Assalamualaikum dan Salam Sejahtera Semua,

Video ini mempersembahkan upacara keramat daripada suku kaum Dusun Sabah khususnya masyarakat Suang Lotud atau Dusun Lotud di Daerah Tuaran. Dikenali sebagai Sogit dan Monolibabou, ritual ini mempunyai kepentingan budaya yang mendalam.

Ritual Sogit, atau Monogit, ialah upacara ""pampasan penyejukan"" tradisional yang dijalankan oleh Tantagas (bobohizan atau dukun) untuk menenangkan mana-mana roh yang marah dan memulihkan keharmonian antara alam rohani dan jasmani. Upacara ini dianggap perlu berikutan pengubahsuaian Batu Sumpah, di mana ia telah dipindahkan dari tempat rehat asalnya. Selaras dengan kepercayaan nenek moyang, perubahan sedemikian mungkin telah mengganggu semangat yang dipercayai secara tradisi untuk menjaga batu itu, menjadikan persembahan penting untuk mendapatkan semula nikmatnya dan mengekalkan peranan pelindung batu itu.

Sebelum mempersembahkan persembahan ini, upacara awal yang dipanggil Monolibabou dijalankan. Di sini, seorang Asug Tantagas menjangkau alam rohani untuk mencari roh dan membimbingnya kembali ke Sampaping/Libabou (Kayangan atau Syurga) selepas ia terganggu semasa pengubahsuaian. Sepanjang upacara ini, nyanyian suci, atau Rinait, dibacakan dalam bahasa kuno yang dikenali sebagai bahasa Kinorohingan (Para Dewa). Bahasa primordial ini, dipercayai sejak awal zaman, dituturkan untuk menghormati kebijaksanaan nenek moyang dan memohon kehadiran ilahi, memelihara keamanan dan kesucian Batu Sumpah.

Sejarah Batu Sumpah Kauluan

  • Pada mulanya, Kampung Kauluan menghadapi pergolakan yang ketara kerana ia sering menjadi sasaran serangan daripada suku kaum Dusun yang berasal dari daerah Tambunan dan Menggatal, serta kawasan bukit sekitar.
  • Konflik berlaku antara penduduk kampung Kauluan dan puak penceroboh, menyebabkan banyak korban di kedua-dua belah pihak.
  • Ramai yang gugur telah dipenggal, dan kepala mereka dibawa pulang sebagai simbol kepahlawanan, keberanian, dan kehormatan dalam peperangan.
  • Penjajahan British pada akhir 1800-an dan pertengahan 1900-an membawa keselamatan ke Kampung Kauluan, kerana senjata moden seperti senjata api dan bom digunakan untuk menghalang serangan puak yang kerap berlaku.
  • Pada 14 April 1956, satu perhimpunan damai telah diadakan di kalangan ketua dan pahlawan puak yang berperang, di mana mereka minum darah sesama sendiri dan berikrar untuk menamatkan permusuhan secara kekal, melanjutkan janji ini untuk memasukkan semua suku Dusun di daerah Tuaran.
  • Satu sumpah suci diucapkan: ""Sesiapa yang mengeluarkan kata-kata kesat atau menghina yang menimbulkan kemarahan dan konflik antara kedua-dua belah pihak akan dikutuk, menjejaskan anak dan cucu mereka.""
  • Untuk memperingati perdamaian ini, sebuah batu sebesar kepala manusia telah ditanam di tapak perjanjian damai.
  • Batu ini, yang dikenali sebagai “Batu Sumpah” atau “Tugu Muhibbah,” kini berdiri di hadapan Dewan Serbaguna di Kampung Kauluan, Tuaran, Sabah。"
"(lungo) 500€ di crypt mai dichiarati, come faccio col ravvedimento  operoso?",ItaliaPersonalFinance,1gsldb2,2024-11-16 06:28:30,0,0.32,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1gsldb2/lungo_500_di_crypt_mai_dichiarati_come_faccio_col/,Zinzo99,Redditi e tasse,"M24, rincoglionito, che vive ancoracommamma

**TL;DR**: Ho appreso questa settimana che devo dichiarare le crypto che possiedo. Non ho i report di alcuni anni perchè un exanger ha chiuso. Si parla di cifre che non hanno mai superato i 550€. Quest’anno ho speso 150€ di  btc in frivolezze. Vorrei un parere su se fare o meno il ravvedimento operoso degli anni di cui non ho i report perchè potrebbe costarmi dei soldi che oggettivamente non valgono.

 

Premessa alla premessa: scusate se mi esprimo come una scimmia ma di finanza non so neanche la terminologia di base.

**Premessa**:  Durante la pandemia e poi per un paio d’anni dopo ho giocato con uno script in python con le API di un noto exanger “XXXX pro” cercando di automatizare le transazioni mangiando un piccolo magine di percentuale, solo ed esclusivamente per il gusto di vedere che poteva funzionare. Poi negli ultimi 2 o 3 anni me ne ero completamente dimenticato. Nel 2023 questo ha chiuso(?) e tutti i miei asset sono stati spostati sulla versione “XXXX” normale dell’exanger. Di conseguenza ho perso la possibilità di far generare automaticamente i report per fare il ravvedimento operoso (mi restano dei file csv dagli script che però non sono mai stati pensati per agevolare la dichiarzazione dei redditi).

 

Per quanto riguarda le mie dichiarazioni dei redditi ho sempre accettato il 730precompilato dell’AdE senza modificarlo (mi restituivano di solito 300€). Per il 730 fatto quest’anno mi sono affidato a un CAF perchè risultava che dovessi pagare quando palesemente ero sotto i limiti. Non ho mai pensato a dichiarare le crypto perchè erano poche e da ignorante ho sempre pensato che esistesse un limite sotto cui non fosse necesdsario dichiararle.

Il dunque: Quest’anno ho speso 150€ di btc in frivolezze e a quel punto mi sono interessato alla parte fiscale. Questa settimana ho appreso del dovere di dichiararle come un investimento e della possibilità di fare il ravvedimento operoso e “mettersi in regola”. Mi ero tenuto libero per farlo oggi ma appare più difficile e costoso per il mio portafogli di quanto non sarebbe consegnare sti 450€ direttamente all’AdE se esistesse un modo.

La mia situazione:

2024-oggi: circa 441€ di total market value del portafogli

2023:

BTC 232.13€;

EUR  121.98€;

LTC  3.15€;

NU  0.83€;

SUKU   0.07€

Total market value: 358.16€

Dal 2018 al 2022: nei report dell’exanger il mio TMV sta tra 0,5€ e 1,5€ perchè non considera i dati relativi all’altro exanger (della stessa azienda) che è stato chiuso(?).

Le **opzioni** che ora vedo sono:

* Fare il ravvedimento operoso dal 2019 al ‘23 stimando con i log degli script e arrotondando a rialzo. (se ho ben capito i guadagni non saranno tassati in quanto palesemente sotto i 2000€).  A questo punto dovrei chiedere aiuto al CAF e poi ovviamente pagare il loro servizio. IN questo caso quanto mi verrebbe a costare? 200€? 600€? Su google non ci sto capendo gran che
* Fare oggi il ravvedimento operoso per il ‘23 e sperare che gli anni precedenti non mi vengano a chiedere nulla.
* Con lo stesso razionale del punto precedente allora potrei fare direttamente la sola dichiarazione relativa al ‘24 l’anno prossimo ma il nuovo exanger comunicherebbe con facilità all’AdE la mia situazione relativa al 2023

Tutto questo per chiedervi un’opinione o un consiglio o altre opzioni, non chiaramente la consulenza da commercialista"
