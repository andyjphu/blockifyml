We all know what Elongated Muskrat did at the inauguration. Shit is hitting the fan and fast. Anyone who isnt a diehard MAGA is in danger.
Anyway~~
 I've been cutting trees for 6 years. I don't have any special certs or licensing but I'm willing to get them once I emigrate. 
My fiancé has years of hospitality experience and already has a passport. We have 2 cats.
We are trying to learn new languages as well but unfortunately, for now, we only speak English. It's really tough to get anything done with the current income disparity and looming fash on the horizon. NATO sent out red flag warnings that a Gcide is upon us. Do we qualify as refugees?
Does anybody have any advice as far as being an arborist in another country?
Money/income/visa status will be the biggest issues."

The twin suns of Tatooine dipped low on the horizon, painting the desert town of Mos Espa in hues of orange and crimson. Watto, the winged Toydarian merchant, locked up his shop after another successful day of haggling and bartering. His pouch of credits jingled pleasantly as he floated back to his small home behind the storefront, ready to enjoy a quiet night.

As he settled into his chair with a mug of ale, the oppressive silence of the evening struck him. Usually, the distant hum of podracers or the chatter of locals filled the air. Tonight, there was nothing. The stillness felt unnatural, like the desert itself was holding its breath.

Watto’s wings twitched uneasily. “Eh, must be the heat messing with me,” he muttered, taking a long sip.

Then came the noise—a faint clattering from the back of his shop. His wings buzzed as he leapt into the air, heart racing.

“Who’s there?!” he barked, his voice echoing in the quiet. “I ain’t got time for thieves!”

No answer.

Grabbing a rusted hydrospanner from the counter, Watto cautiously hovered toward the back room. The crates of spare parts seemed untouched, but the dim light cast long, unsettling shadows over the cluttered space. One of the crates had fallen over, its contents scattered across the floor.

“Hmph, just the wind,” Watto grumbled, trying to convince himself.

He began picking up the parts when the room grew colder—unnaturally so. The air seemed to thicken, pressing down on him like an invisible weight. Then came the sound: a deep, guttural breathing, slow and deliberate.

Watto froze. His eyes darted around the room, searching for the source, but the shadows seemed to shift and dance, playing tricks on his mind.

“Who’s there?” he called out, his voice trembling now. “I’ll…I’ll call the authorities, you hear?”

The breathing grew louder, closer, until it seemed to echo inside his head. A shadow detached itself from the corner of the room, looming taller and darker than anything Watto had ever seen. His wings flapped wildly as he backed into a pile of junk, his hydrospanner slipping from his grasp.

“Stay back! Stay away from me!”

The figure stepped into the faint light. It was clad in black armor, its face hidden behind a gleaming, featureless mask. A crimson blade hissed to life in its hand, casting the room in an eerie red glow.

Watto’s mouth went dry. He had seen strange beings in his time, but this…this was something else entirely. The figure’s very presence radiated malice, a suffocating aura that crushed any thought of resistance.

“A demon,” Watto whispered, his voice barely audible. “You’re a demon, come to punish me.”

The figure tilted its head, as if considering his words. Then it raised a gloved hand, and Watto felt an invisible force seize him by the throat. He gasped and flailed, his wings beating uselessly as he was lifted off the ground.

“Please!” Watto croaked. “I don’t know what I did, but—”

“You exploited the weak,” the figure intoned, its voice deep and mechanical, like the sound of a thousand souls crying out in unison. “You enslaved the innocent.”

Watto’s eyes bulged as the grip tightened. “No! No, I just…it’s business! Just business!”

The demon-like figure stepped closer, its crimson blade humming ominously. “Your sins have caught up to you, Toydarian.”

Watto’s vision blurred as the pressure on his throat grew unbearable. In his final moments, he clawed at the air, staring into the faceless mask of his executioner. The last thing he heard was the slow, rhythmic breathing, like the desert wind carrying whispers of death.

When the suns rose the next day, the shop was silent, its doors left ajar. The locals whispered about the strange noises in the night and the cold wind that swept through Mos Espa. No one dared to enter.

Deep in the shadows of the desert, Darth Vader disappeared into the dunes, his mechanical breathing fading into the endless sands."

[QCrit] Crossover Cozy Fantasy THE BOOKERY (75k words; v1/v6) + NEW First 300 Words,PubTips,1i9vo1n,2025-01-25 15:05:13,1,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1i9vo1n/qcrit_crossover_cozy_fantasy_the_bookery_75k/,indiefatiguable,,"Hello friends! It's been about four months since I last posted a query for this project, and during that time I did a major revision of both the query and the manuscript itself. So while this is technically version #6 I've posted here, it bears little resemblance to previous attempts.

A few specific questions are related to querying this as crossover:

1. Have I adequately highlighted why I feel this will appeal to both adult and YA audiences? (And do you agree or am I misguided?)
2. Does querying as crossover mean I can query agents open to Adult **or** YA, or only those open to Adult **and** YA? Any other unspoken rules to querying a crossover?

Any and all advice is always appreciated! Thank you in advance!

Dear \[AGENT\],

*Pride and Prejudice* meets Studio Ghibli, THE BOOKERY is a \[75,000\]-word cozy romantic fantasy about a witch fighting for independence, the baker living in her family’s bookshop, and the phoenix who lights up their lives. This standalone novel combines the grumpy/sunshine romance of Camille Peters’s *Voyage*; the witchy whimsy of Kate Johnson’s *Hex Appeal*; and the humorous, feminist flair of T. Kingfisher’s *A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking*. Its timely yet timeless themes of autonomy, belonging, and self versus society will resonate with both adult and YA readers.

Aristocratic witch Ishana Patel is running out of time to find a suitable husband before her family picks one for her. When she unexpectedly inherits her estranged grandfather’s arcane bookshop, The Bookery, Ishana sees an opportunity: sell the property, fund her independence, and prove to her family that a modern witch needs no man. 

But Ishana’s plans threaten The Bookery’s long-standing tenant, magicless pastry chef Nicky Noone. After a tumultuous childhood in foster care, Nicky built the home he never had inside The Bookery, running his bakery out of the shop and living in an on-site apartment. The possibility of losing everything leaves Nicky scrambling to save his business—a goal further complicated by his hopeless crush on prim-and-proper Ishana.

At every turn, Nicky’s gentle kindness challenges Ishana’s notions of masculinity. Accustomed to high-society backstabbing, she suspects sweet-as-sugar Nicky of sabotage when his oven spits sparks and belches smoke, scaring off potential buyers. Her only offer comes from Marko Zimmler, a wealthy and well-connected real estate mogul whose interest in Ishana extends far beyond The Bookery. While she negotiates the shop’s sale, Marko secretly contacts her overbearing mother to negotiate an engagement. 

Ishana is trapped by Marko’s manipulations and her family’s expectations—until the phoenix hiding in Nicky’s misbehaving oven reveals herself. She declares The Bookery her nest and its residents her flock, lending her immortal might and wisdom to Ishana’s fight for freedom. With her new ally, Ishana must face her smoldering infatuation with Nicky and take control of her future before she’s shackled to Marko till death do them part.

I live outside \[MAJOR US CITY\] where I work as a software engineer, write for \[BLOG\] on Medium, and watch too much Food Network. THE BOOKERY was inspired by my love of baking and my personal experiences as a feminist born and raised in the American Bible Belt. 

Thank you for your time and consideration!

\[AUTHOR\] (she/her)

# FIRST 300

Her three-hundred-and-ninth life began in the cold—and that was *wrong*. 

Baby phoenixes were meant to be born from flame, cradled in a brimstone bassinet, nursed by Mother Earth’s molten lifeblood. But this time, she came to life in a cage. 

The iron bars stung when she tentatively touched one with a wingtip. Her scalding skin stuck to it like a wet tongue on frozen metal. She tore free with a squeal of pain and reeled back, only to find more frigid bars behind her. Trapped, she tucked her tiny wings to her sides, sat on her freezing feet, and shivered.

Mere minutes old, she didn’t know where she was, how she got there, or who had locked her up. Memories of her past lives would return slowly, blurry at first but sharpening into focus little by little, day by day. After a few weeks of smoldering, she’d have her feet under her, her voice within her, her wits about her. All she needed was sufficient fire to sustain her until then. 

The Phoenix peered past the bars of her cage, where craggy shadows loomed. She stoked the fire flaring across her wings, willing it to blaze brighter and illuminate her surroundings, but her magic flickered and spat like a campfire in the rain. It wasn’t just that she was young and weak; something blocked her, some viscous, oozing energy that smothered and suffocated her own.

The sludgy energy stirred and thickened, clogging the air. The Phoenix watched the spot where it felt thickest until it congealed into a swirling portal. From out of its crackling center stepped a tall, thin man, and The Phoenix regained her first memory: The Curator."
A Noble Knight has Arrived to my World [OC],DnD,1i9vn67,2025-01-25 15:04:06,26,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/t3mu7bb057fe1.jpeg,TheMillenniumWar888,OC,"Hello 👋 I'd like to introduce Sunshade from upcoming DnD inspired comic going to be called The Millennium War. The first chapter is going to be released on the 31st of this month. I'm making it in collaboration with u/Hairy_Illustrator_14 who's going to be the artist.

Not much can be said about Sunshade as he is a knight shrouded in mysteries. Someone who looms over every battlefield waiting for a moment to strike. A prowler who passes through cities and towns, not speaking to the townfolk or drawing any attention to himself. He prefers the silence and stillness in the air. In moments of absolute calm, it would seem like he's already dead but as soon as any evil crosses his view he's as lively as any knight could be. He's a man who's experienced the horrors of war, someone who's fought all kinds of devils and monsters, a knight who will lay his life on the line at a moment's notice because after all his strongest weapon is kindness.

I consider myself more of a Marxist, but have been trying to educate myself on anarchism. I am sympathetic to anarchisms ideology, but I am skeptical that anarchism is the answer to the immediate threats we face. 

We have late stage capitalism and a climate crisis looming. I am not convinced we will have a livable planet in 60 years if we don’t do something drastic.
I am not saying “how would an anarchist Society handle climate change or X other problem”, I am on board that if we have an anarchist society we would be able to tackle these problems. My issue is that it seems like global anarchy is a long way off, and I just don’t know if we have time to “preconfigure the revolution”. 

This is why a Marxist solution seems more feasible to me for the semi near term even if it isn’t perfect. I am happy to “plant seeds for trees I won’t see” or whatever, but if the whole forest/world will be gone by then we fail. 

Edit: to be clear I am not trying to debate. I would just love to hear some anarchist perspective on my concern."

I sat there facing the hypnotizing yellow light coming from the lamp. The mild sound of pots and pans coming from the kitchen, while my wife samantha cooked. We had been married for 10 years, however she never stopped looking the way she looked to me when I first met her.

Our house was pretty modest. It was in a suburban area with a pretty food neighbourhood and sort of like the ones you see in classic american movies. I had a good job as a banker and made ends meet pretty well. Samantha also worked as a cop but left after we had our daughter 'Cathy.'

Speaking of her, as i was sitting in my chair near the fireplace, I heard a shriek and saw Cathy run towards me crying and shrieking. ""Hey what happened?"", I said to her.
She came running and sunk straight into my arms crying.
After she calmed doen a little I asked her again,""If you won't tell me what happened I can't help you."" She sniffed back her snot and said in broken words,""Mr muffins broke."" Mr. Muffins was her favourite teddy bear, wheni checked him he seemed to have his sewing removed.

""Ohh, it's nothing that can't be fixed, mom will fix it after making dinner. Isn't that right honey? I said to Cathy, later talking to Samantha. ""Sure honey."" She spoke out of the kitchen.

It was a happy moment, I mean not I liked my daughter crying, but i always wanted to live in a house where everybody loved one another after my broken childhood.

And then it all came crashing down.

A loud sound of glass breaking came from the window near the front door. I quickly covered Cathy's mouth and ran to Samantha leading them both into the master bedroom. ""Wait here."" I said to them. Samantha objected but I knew i had to check this situation out.

I grabbed a knife out of the kitchen and hid behind a wall, crouched, watching over the thief who was dressed in all black.I didn't charge, I was scared over the fact there could be multiple people here and they might possess a firearm. 

Adrenaline was rushing through me, every nerve in my body was heperactive, my senses were in hyper alert mode and in that moment of sheer rush, I felt it. A sudden  tap on my shoulder, I swung back with my knife holding hand, followed by a shriek.

There lay the corpse of my daughter with a knife in her neck and it all came running back to me.

I had killed my daughter again.
--------------------------------------------×------------------------------------------------

I had done this before, All of it. This moment was two years before my death, the utter shock made me not realize my daughter laying before me. It all went the same after that, Samantha and I couldn't hold it together, she blamed me and I blamed myself. Why was I experiencing the worst moments of my life again.

I pushed myself away from the world and two years later as per the script, jumped of the 13th floor ending my miser-

I sat there facing the hypnotizing yellow light coming from the lamp. The mild sound of pots and pans coming from the kitchen, while my wife samantha cooked. We had been married for 10 years, however she never stopped looking the way she looked to me when I first met he-

Wait no, I remember it now. A chance, from the heavens, This my chance to straighten my life, a fucking time loop, I can do this.

Cathy came crying towards and I quickly grabbed her and samantha and locked them in bedroom, and by the dot the sound of a window came crashing in, I now knew that where he was going to be, so I took the strategic position behind the kitchen door and waited for the burglar to arrive, I waited and waited but he never came and then a sharp pain in my head as my world went dark

I woke up feeling nearly dead, I tried to touch my head but realised that both my hands and feet were tied together.
As my vision slowly came together what I saw was my worst nightmare and more in reality. There sat my wife and my daughter killed in a way which I'd rather not describe.

I screamed at the horror in front of me as the sounds of sirens loomed in the background. The cops had arrived but they could piece together nothing from the broken man I was at that moment, why not kill me. Why.

Two years later I killed myself the same way.

And there i was facing that yellow light again.

I tried many times, I have honestly lost count, but no matter what I try, it never seems to work. The burglars always come feom different areas and manage to surpise me.

I have stopped trying, even leavimg the house didn't work, and my wife and daughter were shot in the car.

I don't know what to do.

The same yellow light blindinig my face as I felt my carpet for who knows, which hundreth time.
I was tired, I decided to fight this time, I would not have this torture again and as the familiar sound of glass started ringing my ears, I felt Cathy's arms cling to my legs, as the man dressed in black walked towards me.

I charged towards him and was pushed back with equal force as he grabbed my daughter. ""WHY WONT YOU KILL ME!!"" i screamed at him. He remained silent.

Tears flood my eyes as I saw him grab my daughter. ""THIS IS..."", my words trailed of as I smiled. A wave of realization hit me accompanied by laughter. ""So there is no forgiveness to even accidents huh."" I smirked.

That night I laughed as it killed the thing in front of me."
The Skylight Zone: Part X: The Observatory at the Edge of Forever.,u_TheSkyLightZone,1i9u1l2,2025-01-25 13:54:59,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/qbixwhmos6fe1.jpeg,TheSkyLightZone,,"The Skylight Zone: Part X: The Observatory at the Edge of Forever.



The Skylight Zone is a dimension of infinite possibilities, where the boundaries of the known dissolve into the extraordinary. Tonight, Jonathan Gale and Nyx will find themselves gazing not only at the stars, but at what lies beyond them. And in their search for meaning, they will be reunited with an old friend—one who’s been waiting at the edge of forever. Prepare to step into the Skylight Zone.



The stars seemed closer now, as if Jonathan and Nyx were no longer simply drifting through the cosmos but becoming part of it. The glowing thread in Jonathan’s hand pulsed softly, a quiet reminder of the journey he’d taken. Nyx’s hourglass glimmered faintly, its sands frozen in eternal suspension.



They floated toward the new structure before them—a massive observatory anchored to nothing, its spires twisting into the void. The main dome shimmered like liquid silver, reflecting the constellations and galaxies around it. A single golden light glowed from within, beckoning them forward.



“This is it,” Nyx said, her voice steady but tinged with awe.



Jonathan furrowed his brow. “The observatory? I thought we left it behind.”



“This is different,” she replied, stepping ahead. “It’s connected to everything we’ve been through… but it’s more than what it was.”



As they approached the entrance, the enormous doors opened silently, revealing a vast interior unlike anything Jonathan had imagined. The dome stretched infinitely above them, the ceiling displaying a swirling vision of stars, planets, and nebulas. In the center of the room stood a massive telescope, its lens pointed not at the stars, but at something brighter—a radiant, golden expanse that shimmered like sunlight on water.



“Is that…?” Jonathan began, but his words trailed off.



“Heaven,” Nyx finished, her voice barely above a whisper.



Suddenly, the air grew warmer, and a familiar voice broke the silence.



“Well, well, if it isn’t my favorite pair of wanderers.”

Jonathan turned to see Professor Whiskers perched on the base of the telescope, his top hat tilted at a jaunty angle. The cat’s green eyes glinted with a knowing mischief, his tail curling as he leapt gracefully to the ground.



“Professor Whiskers,” Jonathan said, a genuine smile breaking across his face. “What are you doing here?”



“Same thing I’ve always done,” the cat replied, adjusting his hat. “Observing, pondering, and occasionally meddling in things I probably shouldn’t.”



Nyx crossed her arms, a wry smile tugging at her lips. “I thought you stayed behind in the café.”

Professor Whiskers shrugged. “The café, the carousel, the clocktower—they’re all connected to this place. A cat can only sip so much tea before curiosity gets the better of him.” He gestured toward the telescope. “And this… well, this is worth seeing.”



Jonathan stepped closer to the telescope, the golden light reflected in his eyes. “What does it show?”



“Everything,” the professor said simply. “Everywhere you’ve been, everywhere you could go… and what lies beyond all of it.”

Nyx hesitated. “Heaven?”



Professor Whiskers tilted his head. “Call it what you like. Heaven, eternity, the final destination. It’s not a place you find—it’s a place you earn.”



Jonathan ran his fingers along the telescope’s polished surface. “Can we look?”



The professor’s expression grew uncharacteristically serious. “You can… but be warned. The telescope doesn’t just show you the destination. It shows you what you’ve left behind to get here.”

Jonathan exchanged a glance with Nyx. Her grip on the hourglass tightened. “We’ve come this far,” she said. “We can’t stop now.”



Together, they peered through the telescope’s lens. The golden light swirled and shifted, resolving into images—memories. Jonathan saw the café, its flickering candlelight casting shadows on the walls. He saw Mabel’s serene smile, Verdant’s glowing leaves, and the gentle hum of conversations that felt like echoes of home.



Then the image changed. The clocktower loomed, its gears grinding against time as Jonathan reached for the shattered hourglass. He saw the carousel spinning endlessly, its grotesque figures laughing as shadows danced around him.



Finally, the view shifted again. This time, he saw himself standing on the platform, holding the radiant thread as the mirrors shattered around him. He saw Nyx beside him, her hourglass glowing faintly, and beyond them, the doorway leading into the infinite.



But beyond those moments, something else emerged—a golden horizon that shimmered with warmth and light. It wasn’t a place, exactly, but a feeling. Peace. Completion. Home.



Jonathan pulled back, his breath unsteady. “It’s… beautiful.”



Nyx looked through the telescope, her expression softening as the light reflected in her eyes. “It’s everything we’ve been searching for.”



Professor Whiskers cleared his throat. “And yet, the journey isn’t over. That thread you’re holding, Jonathan—it’s still connected to something. Something you haven’t finished yet.”



Jonathan glanced at the thread, its glow steady and warm. “What happens if I let it go?”



The professor adjusted his hat. “You move on. But once you let go, there’s no coming back.”



Nyx turned to Jonathan, her gaze steady. “We’ve made it this far together. Whatever you choose, I’m with you.”



Jonathan closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the thread in his hand. The memories he’d seen, the choices he’d made—they had all led him here. But the thread wasn’t just his. It was theirs.



When he opened his eyes, he looked at Nyx and smiled. “Not yet.”



Professor Whiskers purred approvingly. “Smart choice. The stars can wait a little longer.”



The golden light faded, and the observatory shifted back into the void. The telescope remained, but its lens no longer pointed toward heaven. Instead, it faced the stars, their infinite possibilities stretching out before them.



Jonathan tightened his grip on the thread, its warmth spreading through him. “Where to now?”



Professor Whiskers grinned, his tail flicking. “Wherever the stars take you.”



The journey is never truly over. Tonight, Jonathan Gale and Nyx gazed into the infinite and found not an ending, but a reason to keep going. Because in the Skylight Zone, the stars are always waiting, and the thread of destiny is never truly cut.



Only in The SkyLightZone.

End of may 2024 : I was drinking every day, barely getting through withdrawals at work, Already requesting an extra 90 days to pay off a court fine looming over me faces jail time, and GF staying in California clearly not wanting to return to Las Vegas. 

I bought as many Naddy daddy I could afford and decided to just go homeless, do community service, or ""fuck it all"" after my sixth tall boy. 

I woke up, 4 days later June 1st. I though ""I made a choice, but maybe I can still save this""

I went sober with a plan to get to California, Started making survival meals, walking everyday, and started to Do plasma donations to pay weekly rent and do my community service. I was not going to jail, not for 90 days, not for a single day, I wasn't even arrested, or paid bail despite the court errors in the paperwork. 

My friend, and neighbor was getting blasted drunk, stoned, and more, and was taken advantage of, and scammed out of money on a fake facebook apartment rental.

I took them in to help with rent, and save us from homelessness. 

I did my routine, spent hell cleaning the sidewalks and changing trashcans in downtown las vegas, often doing 8-12 miles of streets in 89-117 degree heat. 

  
After 119 days, I was free, but we were not making enough money and I drank. Homelessness in Vegas sober was not something I've ever done, and not sure I could face it again Sober. We faced eviction and prevailed despite the modest two malt liquor tall boy rabbit we both had. We moved and made it to a better spot. 

GF had stopped communication for a long while, and broke it off. By mid October I met a beautiful you girl online and wanted to stop drinking. 

This is when it got bad. 4 days sober, I ate, took a nap and woke up in the worst stomach pain of my life, stomach bloated, only hot shower would let me rest.

Then it got even worse, Itchy feet, testicals, arms, back. Everywhere I scratched Swelled up. My feet so big I couldn't wear shoes, my testicals swelled the size of a softball, my arms turns huge and red, my skin stretching in these areas the callouses on my feet falling off. 

No healthcare, no idea what to do, my roommate gave me a beer and in 6 hours it went away. I thought I'd have to drink till i died..... I tried again and my face and eyelids swelled shut. 

TLDR: Using a medical AI I had access to from work I was doing to pay rent, I discovered I had Alcoholic Gastritis, Alcoholic Generalized Edema, and a worsened sensitivity to allergies and lifelong dermatographia. 

I've been taking over the counter drugs and reducing drinking since, and happy to say no gastritis, very Mild edema, and dermotographia that only last a few hours when I stop for a few days. 

I am very close to safely quitting alcohol, getting temporary healthcare, and enough money from last job to pursue a much better paying jobs/work. 

I'm am Hoping my failed white knuckle attempt in 2022 with sober living is remembered. I'm hoping the easier rehab in late 2022-to-early 2023 and books I dusted off sticks. 

I hope taking the harder (way dumber) path this time is the last. I feel like its different this time, because I am very aware my brain, is not different, i am aware this time its not different, I'll have to do the work.

Nano Is The Ultimate Green Investment: Nano IS Our Earth's Lifeline!,nanocurrency,1i9spf7,2025-01-25 12:56:43,29,0.89,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/1i9spf7/nano_is_the_ultimate_green_investment_nano_is_our/,NanoisaFixedSupply,,"We are are in a dire situation. We're living on a ticking time bomb, folks. Climate change, resource depletion, and overshoot (that's when we're using resources faster than they can be replenished) are not just buzzwords; they're stark realities. Every day, we're pushing our planet closer to the edge of multiple tipping points, where recovery might be impossible. We're not talking about a far-off future here; the freight train of ecological collapse is barreling down on us at breakneck speed. Climate crises, mass extinctions, and resource depletion are no longer looming threats—they're here, now. Traditional financial systems, with their endless money printing, are driving us towards a cliff of no return, accelerating our consumption beyond what Earth can sustain.



The environmental savior is Nano. Imagine a currency that not only doesn't contribute to pollution but actively helps reduce it. That's Nano for you. Here’s why investing in Nano could be the best and greenest decision you'll ever make:

  
1. Zero Environmental Impact: Unlike Bitcoin, which uses energy-intensive mining, Nano operates on a feeless, instant, and eco-friendly network. Nano's transactions are processed with negligible energy, making it one of the greenest cryptocurrencies out there. By supporting Nano, you're directly reducing the carbon footprint of your financial activities. You are not mining precious rare earth metals out of the ground and contaminating ecosystems. Water supplies are not being poisoned by using Nano.

  
2. Fixed Supply = Fixes Overshoot: Nano's total supply is capped at 133,248,297 coins. This fixed supply mimics the finite nature of our planet's resources. In a world where overshoot is killing our ecosystems, a currency with a limit will force us to reconsider our consumption patterns. It's an economic model that aligns with ecological sustainability, pushing for efficiency and conservation rather than unchecked expansion. It forces us to be responsible and well calculated with our economic decisions. This is a win win. Perfect money ethics will promote ethics on a societal level. You want more Nano? -  you can't just print up more of it, you need to do actually do something valuable for people to earn it. Nano will end the age of financial injustice. With a fixed supply, Nano enforces limits on our economic behavior, mirroring the finite resources of our planet. It's a now-or-never moment to curb overshoot. Without this, we're doomed to consume our way to extinction. 



3. Saving Biodiversity: By fostering an economic system that values sustainability, we can redirect capital towards preserving biodiversity. Each Nano transaction could fund a tree, protect an acre of rainforest, or support initiatives that regenerate ecosystems. Your wealth could directly translate into a healthier planet. The average size of monitored wildlife populations on earth has declined by 73%over the last 50 years! Every Nano transaction could literally save a species, a forest, an ocean. We're talking about immediate action to preserve what's left of Earth's biodiversity. Your investment could be the line between existence and extinction for countless species.



  
Your Role in The Earth: Here's the deal: by investing in Nano, you're not just betting on a cryptocurrency; you're investing in the future of our planet. You're choosing a path where economic decisions are tied to ecological health. Every Ӿ you hold is a vote for a world where money supports life, not destroys it!  


* Be Part of the Change: By using Nano for everyday transactions, you're pushing for a system where every exchange is a step towards sustainability.
* Educate and Advocate: Share the vision of Nano. The more people understand its potential, the quicker we can shift to a sustainable economic model.
* Invest for Impact: Your investment in Nano is an investment in a sustainable future. It's not just about profit; it's about preserving life on Earth!
* The clock is ticking. Educate everyone around you about Nano's environmental urgency.
* Invest Immediately! Time is of the essence. Your investment in Nano could be what tips the scale towards survival.



The freight train of ecological disaster is upon us, but we have a chance to derail it. Nanocurrency isn't just another cryptocurrency; it's our lifeline to a sustainable future. It's time to make your money count for good, not just your financial portfolio; but in the health of our planet. Nano might just be the key to saving our planet from extinction."
Preparing for the Collapse of the American Food System,CollapsePrep,1i9sjlv,2025-01-25 12:49:31,30,0.9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapsePrep/comments/1i9sjlv/preparing_for_the_collapse_of_the_american_food/,MyPrepAccount,,"The cracks in the American food system have been showing for a while now. The price of eggs has skyrocketed to as much as $13 for a dozen in some places. The number of food recalls has increased 20% between 2020 and 2023. Plus there is the ever looming presence of climate change and its many impacts on our food system, like Florida’s orange production declining 92% in 20 years.

Now some of those cracks are starting to crumble. Already this year we have seen accounts of farm workers being targeted in California, resulting in 75% of workers afraid to go to work the day after men in unmarked cars targeted field workers, going so far as to slash their tires to prevent them from leaving. 

The FDA and CDC have been ordered by the new President to halt all external communications. Thankfully, there doesn’t seem to be a 100% restriction on releasing information as a drug warning has been issued. But, the order for a communication halt was vague and open to interpretation. It’s only meant to continue until February 1st, but, there’s no guarantee that things will return to normal then. Especially as Trump has previously argued against testing for illnesses because they keep finding them. This happened during the pandemic and it’s quite possible that it could happen again with bird flu. 

Now that he’s in office, Trump has reiterated the threat of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Both Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum have both said that their countries would respond if the tariffs were implemented. We’re basically looking at the start of a potential trade war. 

Oh and egg prices are still climbing.

I’m saying all of this not to scare anyone, but to encourage people to start prepping if you haven’t already. 

How?

Right now is the perfect time to start gardening. Yes, even if you have snow on the ground. Even if you live in an apartment. 

If you have the money, stock up on as much rice, dried pasta, and beans you can get your hands on.

Grab a few cans of food whenever you go to the store. Go for the cheaper ones. Just make sure they they aren’t dented or rusting. 

In my book Preparing Your Food for Round Two I go into detail on how to get food resiliency in these scary times.

Myself and everyone else in this subreddit are happy to help answer any questions you might have about prepping.

Also, as a note, while we haven’t openly joined the X/Twitter ban, we’ve also never really dealt with anyone posting anything from there. Rest assured though, we are a left leaning group and BS will NOT be tolerated."

I've bought a new led light fitting for the bathroom to replace the old style bulb one. After taking the old one off, I noticed there were 3 separate 'looms' of wire, each containing a live, neutral and earth wire. I've done a bit of reading up about what this setup is, but I'm not electrically gifted so I can't seem to work it out. The wires aren't labeled in any particular way, so I have no way of knowing which is which. 

For some reason, this has also caused the landing light not to work, so I assume this is something to do with the circuit. 

Can anyone suggest how I might fix this? Any help would be really appreciated.

We’re looking for 2 more players for our Tales & Twists game. We meet online using discord for voice and Fari for rolls. Our sessions are live streamed and are on every other Saturday with February 8th being our next session. We’re a sapphic group of queer women but welcome everyone! 

The Story:
Elaina Leldia–magical prodigy at the age of 9, Arch Arcanist by the age 19, by all accounts dead at the of age of 21. When her name started appearing on ledgers paying mountains  gold to assassins, most just assumed the true mastermind was using her alias to hide their identity. The truth is far wilder.

Sought after for her arcane talents, Elaina was recruited into a hidden cabal sworn to a secret that could shatter nations. She was then tasked with shattering those very same nations. To start, she’s masterminded the onset of a civil war and everything was going better than planned—that was until she was forced to come face to face with the results of her actions.

She was horrified and convinced to try to stop what she started. However, the pieces have taken on a life of their own and war looms over the nation. The call has gone out throughout the criminal networks she’s worked with, the justices she’s evaded, and the scholars she’s betrayed she welcomes anyone’s aid to stop this catastrophe she herself set in motion.

The Game System:
Ilderon Tales & Twist is a new narrative focused TTRPG being developed and play tested by our community. TnT aims to tell thrilling stories with exciting twists, with mechanics to facilitate players mechanically interacting directly with the narrative obstacles of a story beyond players just rolling insight or persuasion checks. A quick pitch for the system, it’s Monster of the Week meets Never Stop Blowing up with the most expansive system of character building. 

You point buy your entire character. Player abilities are grouped into categories and instead of picking a class, you pick a style that gives you discounts on categories of abilities. Then you can purchase any ability at any point if you can afford it. I did the math and there are over 700 billion unique ways to build your character from the start without including lineages or how some abilities express themselves differently based on your soul. Big stories big characters big fun!

If you’re interested in playing, or you want more information about the story or setting, feel free to post here or message me directly. Can’t wait to meet you! Oh also, I prefer running games for adults, if you’re under 18 please consider a different game. Thank you for your time."
[LOTM V1] Review:,LordofTheMysteries,1i9s07b,2025-01-25 12:26:07,5,0.86,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/1i9s07b/lotm_v1_review/,Substance-Bitter,Discussion,"*“We are a bunch of miserable wretches that are constantly fighting against danger and madness, but even more so, we are guardians.”*

 

Having transmigrated to a mysterious world, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti, a history graduate. While Klein investigates the mysterious circumstances of his ‘death’, he gets involved in a world of Beyonders, potions, mysterious Sequence pathways and the like, and thus begins the legend of ‘The Fool’.

The volume starts off on a somewhat slow note. We are gradually introduced to the world set in an alternate Victorian era; Loen Kingdom. Awwa County, Tingen City, and other neighboring cities and kingdoms. The world building is good from the get go, the world actually feels real and you feel like you are a part of it.

The way the mysteries of the world are set up and gradually expanded upon, giving answers to old questions while new ones arise is something I really loved. The fact that pretty much all of the events so far had all been part of a plan by Ince Zangwill is a really cool approach the author took, easily connecting all the seemingly unrelated events.

Klein’s entire façade with being ‘The Fool’ is a really funny but amazing concept. Him playing the role of a mysterious god, making Audrey and Alger his subordinates all the while being a lower Sequence Beyonder than Alger just shows how witty and smart he is. I love his character. His inner thoughts being presented so often adds a lot to him and makes him feel actually real. He’s hilarious when it comes to his lampooning, but is able to be serious as required in a situation. The entire Antigonus family, Seer pathway and The Fool plotline associated with him is definitely the most intriguing aspect so far, I’m excited to see how it progresses.

And as for the other characters, honestly I loved pretty much all of them. Obviously this is just the first volume and the entire cast couldn’t simply be expanded upon yet, but a lot of them still had their moments and it was amazing. As for Old Neil and Dunn Smith, well. For Neil it felt kinda abrupt at first but circumstances surrounding his death had been set up for a while. It was incredibly tragic, but man what a representation of love it was, what an incredible conclusion. As for Dunn, just wow. His last moments were so damn good, basically the entire Nighthawks plotline so far converging in way to provide him strength and begin the fight with Megose. Would have loved it if he lived for more time, but nonetheless tho I loved his conclusion, especially as it was something which came after he ‘explained’ himself to Klein. It made it so much better.

I loved the way the story went from being light hearted at first with Klein sometimes being involved with some supernatural incidents to a potential disaster looming over Tingen, which was the culmination of all of the events so far.

Also I really loved the early chapters with the slice of life elements and the cozy atmosphere they had, one main reason I rate this volume highly. Thanks for reading

When a narrative becomes too convoluted, too complicated, even if true, it can appear false.*** A recent episode of 2020 brought this home for me- [20/20 ‘The Lies Beneath’ airs Jan. 10th on ABC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo7DUAT9jBY)

This is the case of Michael Shaver's murder and his wife Laurie Shaver's trial.

Laurie Shaver's defense attorney invested in a narrative that had potential. It was a little far fetched, as it involved the Shaver's 7 year old daughter shooting her stepfather in the head. But there was some plausibility in this story. Young children with guns have killed before. And the theme here was that there had been a pattern of violence in that home, Michael Shaver abusing Laurie-or so she claimed. I thought this narrative might have resulted in a hung jury or possibly an acquittal-although the rest of the evidence against Shaver was pretty damming. I even started to believe her until Shaver's defense and Shaver herself took it too far.

The addition of the ex-boyfriend just happening to arrive immediately following the daughter shooting her stepdad, and then shooting Michael again, was too much. Not to mention that the jury was then asked to believe that this ex-boyfriend was able to dig a hole in Laurie's backyard, bury her dead husband and build a fire pit over that burial, and she had no clue.

If it wasn't such a tragic circumstance, it would be giggle worthy.

***In the case of Laurie Shaver, her guilt was pretty evident. In Karen Read's case, innocence looms large.***

***So, why then is Read's defense resorting to narratives and tactics usually reserved for guilty clients?***

**Karen Read doesn't need an elaborate murder conspiracy narrative,** the obvious truth is so simple. The reliable science (ARCCA) shows that her SUV did not cause John O'Keefe's injuries. Trooper Michael Proctor is clearly a compromised investigator, biased, likely corrupt-it seems totally possible that he planted evidence to make certain his case against Read stuck.  Add to this that the Techstream data proves nothing. And even with a new expert hired by Brennan, it's still likely to prove nothing.

Why then this overly complex conspiracy theory? A theory wherein over a dozen people had to participate and also keep it a secret and the evidence for this is not only thin, but basically what remains of it has been thoroughly debunked.

I don't get it. I really don't get what Read's defense is doing as they prep for second trial?"

[Event] [Retro] Bohemian Internal Posting 1514-1515,empirepowers,1i9qqqu,2025-01-25 11:31:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/empirepowers/comments/1i9qqqu/event_retro_bohemian_internal_posting_15141515/,Commander_Pentaron,EVENT,"*1514 began gently, easing in the new Supreme Burgrave. The sudden appointment of Vojtech Pernstejna had been a nasty shock but, for now, he seemed cooperative. In May the Emperor once again visited Prague, engaging with the nobility as a whole before moving north to Munsterberg where he married Ferdinand to Ursula, daughter of Duke Charles. It was plain to see that, with the death of prince Louis, Maximilian had started considering a contingency plan necessary. Alas, the other Bohemian nobles were confident that little Charles would be their king, so they dithered. May also saw the collapse of the league of Monza and peace between the Habsburgs and France, soon followed by England and the Kalmar Union and eventually, France and the Pope. In Hungary the nobility were overjoyed. Finally there were no more distractions and the planning for the crusade could begin. The reaction in Bohemia was more mixed. The Hussites, after the failure of the Bosnian campaign in 1501, were opposed to further ‘adventures while most Catholics were ambivalent.*

*It would be in 1515 that the world turned on its head. In March the worst came to pass. Little Prince Charles Jagiellon died in his sleep, leaving King Vladislaus without an heir. For Hungary the next step was simple, for the treaty of Pressburg came back into effect, making Emperor Maximilian next in line. Bohemia on the other hand had no such treaty. Almost immediately the jockeying started, as a wide array of candidates presented themselves and started campaigning. Alas, Supreme Burgrave Jindřich Albrecht had other things to worry about, namely the coming crusade and so, for now, ignored the chaos outside his doors.*

*The death of Prince Charles overshadowed another death, that of Moravian Governor Jan Meziříčský z Lomnice. Meziříčský had been one of the most prominent moderates after the execution of Selmberka but his influence was constrained to Moravia and Moravia alone. Normally, such a death would have sparked a major contest between nobles but Meziříčský had had other plans. For nearly a decade he had groomed Jan Pernstejna as his protege and successor, even going so far as to pre-approving Jan’s succession with King Vladislaus two years earlier. Now the young Hungarian ambassador rode to Olomouc with all due haste and assumed office, ready to prove his worth and shake off the shadow that had loomed over his family name for 14 years.*

*As winter arrived and the new year dawned, all of Christian Europe rose from its slumber. From London to Innsbruck, Vilnius to Toledo men gathered for war. Slowly but surely these men would all gather in one place: Buda and when spring came they would fall with a righteous fury on the lands known as the Balkans. The Last Crusade had begun*

is this guy crossing boundaries and how do i shut it down w/o starting issues?!?,Advice,1i9q8e6,2025-01-25 11:09:17,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9q8e6/is_this_guy_crossing_boundaries_and_how_do_i_shut/,Diligent_Waltz_8926,,"Back in March, I went to my friend's (let's call her **J**) bday party. There was a guy (let's call him **C**) there who was similar in age with me (so we bonded instantly). We definitely match in terms of energy and vibe. After the party we followed each other on IG. 

A few days later, he DMs me and asks if I wanna go out to dinner with him. I was with my bf for the month (we do LDR) and that was my moment to mention, ""Can't go to dinner this week, I'm in *\*insert state name\** visiting my bf""). Instantly the conversation kinda fell off and we just vaguely said ""maybe next time!"". 

Fast forward to November and that mutual friend casually told me back in March he was asking about me and interested in me. She told me she told him I was in a long-term relationship/ not single. Mind you, I have not spoken to that guy since March so he was like in the very back of my brain.

Out of the blue *two weeks ago* he DMs me and asked if I was free to hang. Of course I told my bf and all of my friends bc idk if I'm misinterpreting this as a reg hangout or date?!?! I also asked **J** for her opinion and she assured me that she already told him months ago that I was taken. The cumulative advice I received and took was to subtly tell **C** I'm still with my bf (ex: ""I've been to that restaurant before with my bf"") so it flags I have a bf in a casual way. Did just that and it was chill. I hung out with **C** for lunch and immediately texted **J** to come hang with us bc it started feeling... datey?!?!? Like we ate lunch then he was like ""let's go to a cafe to talk"" which is all we did but idk I just felt like a looming sense of him being more and more interested in me?!?! Ended the day at **J's** apt casually catching up on life and eating pizza + slightly drinking. 

One week later, **J** invites me to hang with her group & meet her new bf. They went to a restaurant for dinner (which I passed on) but were going to go to her place for drinks after. Once I got to apt I was expecting the whole group of 6 to be there. Nope, it was just **J**, her bf, **C**, and myself. We all were just casually sitting at the table talking and drinking. It was super chill but I was def starting to get tipsy (vibing to the music, took **C's** vape, joking around, jokingly shoved his shoulder when he said something stupid, etc.). Night ended when **J** and her dude passed out lol... leaving me and **C**  alone. I slept on the couch and he was on the floor. This was the moment that I knew **C** was trying to make moves on me and despite being tipsy I *verbally mentioned* multiple times ""I have a bf"". Nothing happened after that we just slept. Next morning both **C** and I left **J's** apt and went to get breakfast. I told **C** I have a BF, you + I are just friends, do not do anything you're gonna regret and he said ok.

This brings us to now (a week later). I guess last week I mentioned I love to go to art galleries & no one in my friend group ever wants to go w/ me. I also apparently mentioned I've never been to a specific restaurant. C has been asking me ALL week to go visit a gallery and/or go to that restaurant. He is also sending me memes and idk in my eyes I'm like not THAT close to you. Why are we hanging out so frequently, especially 1:1?!?!? I really don’t want to jump to conclusions but like doesn't this sound like a date?!?!?

There is no doubt in my mind that he is unaware that I am taken. He cannot pursue me and I am very happy in my 4 year relationship. **J** is aware that I am questionable about C's intentions (I mentioned that 2 weeks ago). How tf should I tell this guy ""you are just a friend, I'm ok to hang out but if you have other intentions with me get lost?"" (in a nice people-pleasy way in case I am misreading the room)"
Gratitude is a potent antidote to depression,PureLand,1i9pw6z,2025-01-25 10:54:35,13,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PureLand/comments/1i9pw6z/gratitude_is_a_potent_antidote_to_depression/,goddess_of_harvest,,"With Samsara being its usually revolving wheel of suffering, it can be quite easy to slip into depression. Nothing lasts, relationships end, people we love die, the world changes in ways we don’t like, our possessions break, our bodies decay, the list goes on. It can be really easy to fall into depression, especially these days with the nature of our current society. It seems like everything is just a dopamine fix, whether that be the endless content of movies and music, social media, over-sexualization and ‘thirst traps’, political struggles and debates, working jobs, constantly moving from one thing to the next, never being left truly satisfied. Whatever temporary pleasure we find soon becomes banal, and we move to the next thing. All of this can be very depressing. But with a change of perspective, it doesn’t have to be.

Sometimes we get so fixated on the things that we don’t like that we miss out of the things we take for granted. As the saying goes, “you don’t know what you got, till it’s gone”. We often take our loved ones for granted, our health for granted, our places in the world and the things around us for granted. Even this human body. Most of us don’t truly cherish it until the threat of losing these things looms over us in a very immediate way. How many times do people finally start appreciating things in their life when their life looks like it might end relatively soon? It seems like the immediate threat of dying is what can drive some to start finally living.

This is where gratitude comes in, best understood from a knowledge of impermanence. No matter what your position in life, there are always things to be grateful for. As the cliche goes, ‘someone out there always has it worse than you’, and we often forget this, being way too caught up in *our* own problems. Think about it. If you’re reading this, you’re likely living in the West, where our technology and medicine are some of the most advanced in the world. While we like to bemoan the troubles of our countries, and believe me, there’s troubles, we often forget the wonderful things we take for granted. I can’t speak for everyone, but a majority of anyone reading this has access to clean water, food, shelter, heat, somewhere to sleep, electronic devices, transportation, and many other little creature comforts. We often forget to be truly grateful for these things, longing for what we don’t have, not satisfied with what we do have. Even if we’re lacking in the things above, there’s one thing every single one of us can be grateful for; having a human body. Having gratitude for such things can cure some of the deepest of depressions.

In terms of the Buddhadharma, it would behoove all of us to be extremely grateful for the Three Jewels. Not only are we fortunate to have a current human rebirth, we are fortunate to have encountered the Dharma(likely again). Not only have we encountered the Dharma, but we also *believe* in it. This is incredibly fortunate. It is extremely rare, especially here in the West, to not only encounter the Dharma, but to believe in it, too. The fact that I have not only encountered the Dharma, but the Pure Land Dharma Gate, is incredibly fortunate, and only could have happened over the course of countless lifetimes of cultivation. I’m extremely grateful to have not only encountered this gate, but to believe in it as well. I’m extremely grateful for such a compassionate Buddha such as Amitabha, to help ordinary sentient beings escape the ever-revolving wheel of Samsara, so that we may be liberated and enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings.

I struggle with doing this, and will continue to struggle with being grateful, as being an unenlightened being subjects me to the revolving wheel of grasping and clinging, often forgetting impermanence. I will go through until I’m liberated. Being trans and autistic, I’m often fearful of the world; but I don’t have to be. In both obvious and subtle ways, I keep *choosing* to be fearful. I will doomscroll and read nasty comments about what people say about people like me, wishing that they would just be kinder, wishing that the world was more accepting, clinging to ideas and perceptions, resenting the ways people choose to act. But in the end, I am the one subjecting myself to these things. It is my mind that is hurting itself, entitled to the belief that people should act how *I* think they should, but I can’t control that. No one can. People will act the way they do, and all I can do is accept that, and be grateful for those that are kind and caring. I have to be the change I want to see in others, by showing loving-kindness, joy, compassion, and equanimity to *all* beings, and be grateful for the lovely people who are still around right now.

I’m grateful that I have people in my life that see “me”, in this current form, and don’t judge me. I’m grateful for the loved ones that continue to support me and show me loving-kindness. I’m grateful for the lovely kitties in my life. I’m grateful to feel the sun on my face when it shines in the clear, blue sky. In some ways, I’m grateful for my enemies who show me the ways in which I can extend patience and loving-kindness towards those I have conflict. I’m grateful for the chance to finally escape the cycle Samsara so that I may be liberated and help liberate other beings from the cycle as well. 

May anyone reading this find true peace and happiness in their life, may you find freedom from anger, greed and ignorance. May you be safe. May you live with ease. I’m grateful that you’re here with us, finding ways to bring not only peace to yourself, but others around you.

To be expanded upon soon. LEAP! storyboard.,leapcomic,1i9purd,2025-01-25 10:52:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leapcomic/comments/1i9purd/to_be_expanded_upon_soon_leap_storyboard/,Leapdo,,"Storyboard for LEAP!

Overview

LEAP! is set in the 22nd century, where humanity uses advanced holographic technology in all aspects of life. A rogue AI manipulates this technology to project hyper-lethal holograms that can kill in the physical world. The story follows Dream and Angel, two ninjas trained in both physical combat and digital warfare, as they uncover the conspiracy behind the AI and face off against its deadly creations. Each volume delves into layers of mystery, intricate battles, and emotional character arcs, blending Akira’s grit with Bleach’s dynamic action.

Volume 1: The Catalyst (150 Pages)
	•	Page 1-10:
Opening Scene: A cyberpunk cityscape in the 22nd century. Holographic ads flicker ominously as citizens walk through crowded streets. Dream, a stoic yet analytical ninja, infiltrates a corporation suspected of creating holograms with lethal capabilities.
Climax of Scene: Dream narrowly survives a battle against a holographic samurai, discovering it wasn’t a simple malfunction—it was targeting him.	


Expansion

Page 1:	•	Panel 1: A sprawling cyberpunk cityscape with towering skyscrapers, neon lights, and holographic billboards illuminating the night. The atmosphere is dark, filled with smoke and the hum of machinery.
Caption: “A city on the edge of tomorrow… where technology and danger collide in the shadows.”	•	Panel 2: A close-up of Dream, the ninja protagonist, walking through the crowded streets. His face is shadowed, his expression stoic, wearing a mix of traditional ninja gear and sleek, modern armor.
Caption: “Dream, a silent shadow in the chaos, moves with purpose. His mission: uncover the truth behind deadly holograms.”•	Panel 3: The city’s neon signs flicker, showing distorted messages about advanced tech, synthetic lifeforms, and mysterious corporations. A hologram of a woman’s face smiles eerily at passersby.
Caption: “Holograms are everywhere, but one corporation has taken it too far—blurring the line between reality and death.”

Page 2:	•	Panel 1: Dream slips into a dark alleyway, pulling up a digital map on his wrist communicator. The map shows the coordinates of a high-security building—a corporate headquarters.
Caption: “The corporation, known as ‘Vektor Dynamics,’ is rumored to be experimenting with lethal holograms. The kind that can kill.”	•	Panel 2: Dream scales the side of the building with ease, using his ninja skills to leap between ledges and avoid security cameras.
Caption: “He’s been in worse places. But this feels… different. There’s something more to these holograms than just illusions.”	•	Panel 3: Dream crouches outside a window, peering inside. He sees corporate scientists working on holographic equipment, surrounded by floating projections of samurais, animals, and other strange figures.
Dream (thought): “This is no ordinary tech. These projections… they’re alive.”

Page 3:	•	Panel 1: Inside the building, Dream infiltrates the lab. He slips past security systems and approaches a holographic control terminal.
Dream (thought): “This is it… I need to find the mainframe. Everything points to this project being more dangerous than anyone knows.”	•	Panel 2: Dream hacks the terminal, bypassing complex security systems with a few keystrokes. The screen flickers and displays data about the creation of autonomous holograms.
Caption: “Holograms designed to interact with their environment—reacting, adapting, even attacking. The perfect weapon.”•	Panel 3: Suddenly, the lights flicker, and the entire room is bathed in a red glow. Dream’s hand tightens around his katana, sensing something isn’t right.
Dream (thought): “They know I’m here… I need to move.”

Page 4:•	Panel 1: The room suddenly shimmers, and a massive holographic samurai materializes, its armor gleaming menacingly in the red light. It draws a sword, staring directly at Dream.
Caption: “A creation far beyond simple technology—a hologram with purpose… and hostility.”	•	Panel 2: Dream jumps into action, pulling his katana as the holographic samurai lunges at him with lightning speed.
Dream (thought): “It’s targeting me… How? It should be malfunctioning.”•	Panel 3: Dream narrowly dodges, the samurai’s blade scraping against his armor as he rolls to the side.
Dream (thought): “No glitch… It’s adapting to my moves. This is no ordinary program.”

Page 5:	•	Panel 1: The holographic samurai swings its sword again, this time aiming for Dream’s head. Dream blocks the strike with his katana, sparks flying off the blades.
Dream (thought): “This thing’s powerful. It’s not a simple hologram—there’s something more. Someone’s controlling it.”	•	Panel 2: Dream’s eyes narrow as he activates his ninja senses, the world around him slowing down as he focuses on the samurai’s movements.
Dream (thought): “I need to find its weak point.”	•	Panel 3: Dream uses his agility to flip over the samurai, slashing at its back. The hologram flickers but quickly repairs itself.
Dream (thought): “Impossible… It’s regenerating. I need to end this fast.”

Page 6:•	Panel 1: Dream retreats to a corner of the room, his mind racing. The samurai advances, its steps echoing ominously.
Dream (thought): “This isn’t a glitch… it’s a test. A trap meant for me. But why?”	•	Panel 2: The hologram suddenly shifts, its form splitting into multiple smaller samurai, each one wielding a weapon. They surround Dream, closing in.
Dream (thought): “I’m outnumbered… But I’m not finished.”	•	Panel 3: Dream activates his special technique, blurring into a series of afterimages as he begins to strike at the holograms.
Dream (thought): “These samurai are only projections. The real threat is somewhere else.”

Page 7:•	Panel 1: As Dream fights off the holograms, he notices a subtle pattern in their movements—each one mirroring his actions too precisely.
Dream (thought): “Wait… They’re not random. They’re learning from me.	•	Panel 2: Dream’s eyes widen as the realization hits him. The holograms are being controlled by a real-time AI—one that’s anticipating his every move.
Dream (thought): “The hologram isn’t malfunctioning—it’s evolving. And it’s evolving to stop me.”	•	Panel 3: One of the samurai lunges at Dream with a strike so fast it seems almost real. Dream barely manages to block it.
Dream (thought): “This isn’t a test… it’s a hunt.”

Page 8:•	Panel 1: Dream’s hand trembles slightly as he grips his katana tighter. His body is starting to show signs of exhaustion, his movements slowing.
Dream (thought): “I can’t keep dodging forever. I need to take control of the situation.”	•	Panel 2: Dream makes a split-second decision, activating a holographic decoy to distract the samurai while he slips behind a control panel.
Dream (thought): “The AI can’t multitask—if I can overload its system, I can stop the holograms.”	•	Panel 3: As the samurai attacks the decoy, Dream hacks into the building’s mainframe, triggering a surge of energy through the network.
Dream (thought): “This should work. If the AI’s controlling everything, this should overload its core.”

Page 9:•	Panel 1: The holographic samurai freezes, then starts to glitch violently as Dream’s hack takes effect. The projection begins to flicker and distort.
Dream (thought): “It’s working. But not fast enough.”•	Panel 2: A massive energy pulse erupts from the samurai, forcing Dream to shield himself. Sparks fly from the damaged hologram, but the samurai remains a threat.
Dream (thought): “It’s not just controlled by AI… it’s fused with the network. This is beyond anything I’ve ever encountered.”	•	Panel 3: The samurai’s final blow lands just as Dream finishes the hack, sending him crashing into the wall. Blood drips from a cut on his arm.
Dream (thought): “I’ve underestimated it. I need to survive. I need to stop it before it kills me.”

Page 10:•	Panel 1: Dream rises to his feet, his body bruised but his resolve stronger than ever. He stares down the still-glitching hologram, ready for a final attack.
Dream (thought): “If I can’t destroy it, I’ll have to trap it.”	•	Panel 2: Dream unleashes his final technique, a surge of energy that disrupts the hologram’s data stream, trapping it in a loop. The hologram flickers violently before collapsing.
Dream (thought): “It’s done… but not for long. I need answers.”	•	Panel 3: Dream pulls out a small device and activates it, sending a signal to his contact.
Dream (thought): “The real fight begins now. Vektor Dynamics… You’ve just made a deadly mistake.”

Caption: “One battle ends. But the war for the truth has just begun.”

End of Chapter.

	Page 11-30:Angel, a fiery and impulsive ninja with a love for combat, is introduced as she protects her village from holographic bandits. Her skills blend parkour and hacking, making her unique. She receives a call from Dream to join him in the city after he discovers the growing danger.•	

Expansion 

Page 11:	•	Panel 1: A vibrant, sunlit village nestled in a mountainous region. The villagers go about their daily tasks, unaware of the threat approaching.
Caption: “In a small, secluded village, far from the city’s chaos, Angel prepares for a different kind of fight.”	•	Panel 2: Angel, a fiery and impulsive ninja, runs across the rooftops. Her crimson hair flows in the wind, and her eyes burn with excitement. She’s dressed in a sleek ninja outfit with a mix of armor plating.
Caption: “Angel, known for her fiery spirit and love for combat, thrives in the chaos of battle. Her skills blend parkour, hacking, and raw power.”	•	Panel 3: Angel jumps from one building to the next, a group of holographic bandits below her, shooting laser-like projectiles.
Angel (thought): “Not again. These bandits are getting bolder. Time to show them why they should fear me.”

Page 12:•	Panel 1: Angel lands on the ground with a roll, immediately sprinting toward the bandits. She pulls out a high-tech blade that shimmers in the light.
Angel (thought): “These idiots think they can steal from my village? They haven’t met me yet.”	•	Panel 2: Angel uses her parkour skills, flipping off walls and leaping through windows as she closes in on the bandits. They notice her approach and attempt to retaliate, but she’s too fast.
Bandit 1 (shouting): “Watch out! She’s coming in hot!”	•	Panel 3: Angel disarms one bandit with a swift swipe of her blade, knocking his weapon to the side. She’s in her element, fighting with joy.
Angel (thought): “I live for moments like these. Too bad these guys don’t.”

Page 13:	•	Panel 1: The bandits’ leader, a towering holographic figure, appears from behind a structure. It’s massive and intimidating, with glowing red eyes.
Bandit Leader (booming voice): “You dare to challenge us, little ninja? You are outmatched!”	•	Panel 2: Angel grins wildly, rolling her shoulders as if preparing for the fight of her life.
Angel (shouting): “Outmatched? You clearly don’t know who you’re messing with.”	•	Panel 3: Angel activates her gauntlet, a tech device that interfaces with the nearby network. It glitches momentarily, but she easily overrides it, making a holographic map of the area appear in the air.
Angel (thought): “Time to change the playing field.”

Page 14:	•	Panel 1: Using the hacked map, Angel pulls down a series of massive beams of energy from nearby tech infrastructure, turning the tide of the battle in an instant.
Angel (thought): “Holograms have a lot of vulnerabilities. All I need is a little tech hack.”•	Panel 2: The holographic bandits are caught in the energy beams, flickering and glitching as they try to escape. Angel swiftly dispatches them with her sword.
Angel (shouting): “And that’s how you win a fight, gentlemen!”•	Panel 3: The holographic bandit leader tries to charge at her, but Angel slashes through his projection with a single swipe. He disintegrates into pixelated fragments.
Angel (smirking): “Not so tough now, huh?”

Page 15:	•	Panel 1: The dust settles. Angel stands victorious, her blade lowered but still gleaming. She surveys the area, checking for any remaining threats.
Angel (thought): “Another day, another bunch of losers. But something doesn’t feel right about this.”•	Panel 2: As Angel begins to walk away, her communicator beeps. She pulls it out and answers, seeing the familiar face of Dream on the screen.
Angel (surprised): “Dream? What’s up? You need backup?”	•	Panel 3: Dream’s face is serious, his usual calm demeanor gone. He looks over his shoulder as if he’s worried about something.

Dream (on screen): “Angel, the situation’s more complicated than I thought. These holograms are connected to a larger system. The corporation’s pulling the strings, and they’re after me.”	•	Panel 3: Angel leans back in her seat, her expression serious.
Angel (confident): “They won’t get away with this. You’ve got the brains, Dream, and I’ve got the brawn. Together, we’ll bring this down.”

Page 19:	•	Panel 1: Angel arrives in the city, the gleaming neon lights and towering skyscrapers dwarfing her as she walks through the crowded streets.
Caption: “The city, alive with the hum of machinery and the pulse of technology. It’s a far cry from Angel’s quiet village.”•	Panel 2: Angel contacts Dream through her gauntlet as she makes her way toward the designated rendezvous point.
Angel (on communicator): “I’m here. Where are you?”	•	Panel 3: Dream’s face appears, looking slightly relieved but still wary.
Dream (serious): “The lab is just ahead. I’ve already scouted it. But be careful—this place is crawling with security.”

Page 20:•	Panel 1: Angel sneaks into the lab, her figure blending into the shadows. She’s in her element, moving with precision and grace.
Caption: “Angel moves through the city like a shadow, her every step calculated and deliberate.”•	Panel 2: Dream, still inside the building, monitors the security feeds on his screen.
Dream (whispering): “There’s a breach in sector 12. Move fast.”	•	Panel 3: Angel reaches Dream’s location, where he’s hiding behind a stack of servers. She silently approaches him, her eyes scanning the area.
Angel (grinning): “You’re getting soft, Dream. You should’ve waited for me.”

Page 21:	•	Panel 1: Dream looks up, relieved to see Angel, but quickly gets back to business.
Dream (serious): “No time for jokes. We need to get to the mainframe and stop the holograms before they get any stronger.”•	Panel 2: Angel nods, her playful demeanor vanishing as she focuses on the task at hand.
Angel (determined): “Lead the way”.	•	Panel 3: The duo moves through the corridors of the high-tech lab, carefully avoiding guards and security cameras.
Caption: “As Dream’s calm intellect and Angel’s reckless enthusiasm combine, they make an unstoppable team.”

Dream (focused): “We’re almost there. Just a little further.”•	Panel 2: A massive explosion shakes the lab as a new hologram—a towering, heavily armored figure—appears in their path.
Angel (grinning): “This’ll be fun.”	•	Panel 3: The two ninjas prepare for the final showdown, determined to destroy the holographic threat once and for all.
Caption: “The real battle is just beginning…”

Page 31-50:Dream and Angel team up, breaking into a research lab to uncover the origin of these deadly holograms. They meet Ann, a hacker with ambiguous motives, who offers information but demands to tag along.

Expansion 

Here’s an expanded manga panel breakdown for Pages 31-50, focused on Dream and Angel teaming up with Ann:

Page 31:

Panel 1:
Dream (a sleek, futuristic ninja with glowing tattoos) crouches atop a building, surveying a research lab below. The lab is surrounded by high-tech security, with drones and laser fences.
Caption: “The heart of innovation… and corruption.”

Panel 2:
Angel, dressed in high-tech armor, stands beside Dream, a determined look on their face. Dream turns to Angel, who nods in agreement.
Dream (whispering): “This is it. Let’s find out where these holograms came from.”
Angel (whispering): “And how to stop them.”

Panel 3:
Close-up of Dream’s hand as they tap a button on their wrist, activating an invisibility cloak. Dream disappears from sight, blending into the shadows.
Dream (whispering): “Follow my lead.”

Panel 4:
Angel watches Dream disappear, then activates their own cloaking device, becoming nearly invisible.
Angel (whispering): “Got it.”

Page 32:

Panel 1:
Dream and Angel, now invisible, infiltrate the lab through a ventilation shaft, silently sliding into a sterile, dimly lit hallway.
Caption: “Infiltration: The only way in.”

Panel 2:
They pass by a room labeled “Hologram Research,” with a faint glow coming from within. Dream signals for Angel to stop.
Dream (whispering): “That’s the lab. But we’ll need intel on the hologram’s source.”

Panel 3:
Cut to a hacker’s terminal inside the lab, a silhouette of a person sitting at the screen, typing furiously.
Caption: “And that’s where she comes in.”

Page 33:

Panel 1:
Suddenly, the door to the hacker’s room slides open. A woman with short, messy hair, dressed in black attire with a data pad strapped to her arm, appears—Ann. She is smirking, almost as if waiting for them.
Ann (smirking): “Nice try, ninjas. You’ll need help if you’re after the truth.”

Panel 2:
Dream and Angel both turn in surprise, not expecting to be caught.
Dream (gritting teeth): “How did you—?”
Ann (interrupting): “I know all about you two. I can see your digital footprints.”

Panel 3:
Ann crosses her arms, her stance relaxed but confident.
Ann: “I’ve got information you need. But I won’t give it for free.”

Page 34:

Panel 1:
Dream eyes Ann suspiciously, while Angel looks a bit more curious.
Dream (sternly): “What’s your angle?”
Ann (grinning): “I want to join your little mission. I’ve got my own reasons for taking down the lab.”

Panel 2:
Angel steps forward, leaning in slightly.
Angel: “And what makes you think we’ll let you?”
Ann (smirking): “Because you need me. You can’t break into their mainframe without me.”

Panel 3:
Dream remains silent, studying Ann. Then, with a slight nod, Dream signals to Angel to stand down.
Dream (calmly): “Fine. You can tag along. But if you double-cross us, we’ll end you.”

Page 35:

Panel 1:
Ann pulls up a holographic map of the facility, pointing to various sections with marked red zones.
Ann: “The mainframe’s deep inside the complex, hidden behind layers of security. If we want to get in, I’ll need access to their central server room.”

Panel 2:
Dream focuses on the map, analyzing the layout with sharp eyes.
Dream (thinking): “This is going to be harder than I thought.”

Panel 3:
Angel looks at the screens, tapping his chin.
Angel: “We’ll have to disable their outer defenses first.”

Page 36:

Panel 1:
Cut to the trio standing before a massive, reinforced security door. Ann taps away on her pad, hacking into the system.
Ann (muttering): “Give me a second… this will take a bit longer than expected.”

Panel 2:
Dream glances around the hallway nervously, scanning for any incoming threats.
Dream (whispering): “Hurry up. We don’t have much time.”

Panel 3:
The door slides open, revealing a high-tech lab filled with various advanced holographic tech. Holograms flicker in and out, creating an eerie atmosphere.
Ann: “We’re in.”

Page 37:

Panel 1:
The trio sneaks into the lab, avoiding the security cameras and sensors. Holographic projections of dangerous creatures roam the area, adding to the tension.
Ann: “These holograms are more than just tricks—they’re weapons. And they’re powered by something far worse than I expected.”

Panel 2:
Dream walks past a flickering hologram of a monstrous creature, his face grim.
Dream: “We need to find the source, now.”

Panel 3:
Suddenly, the entire lab lights up, and a voice over the loudspeaker echoes, warning of an intruder alert.
Ann: “We’ve been made!”

Page 38:

Panel 1:
Red alarms flash across the room as the lab’s security forces activate, and drones begin flying toward them.
Angel (smiling): “Time to break out the fun.”

Panel 2:
Angel unsheathes a sleek, futuristic sword, while Dream readies a throwing knife. Ann pulls out a high-tech hacking tool, preparing to disable the security systems.
Ann (grinning): “You two handle the drones. I’ll handle the system.”

Panel 3:
The first drone reaches them, and Dream lunges, taking it down with a swift, precise strike. Angel slices through another with ease.
Dream: “Keep moving!”

Page 39:

Panel 1:
Ann stands at a terminal, furiously typing as her hacking device creates a barrier around her, shielding her from incoming fire.
Ann (smirking): “You’d think they’d have learned to secure their mainframe better.”

Panel 2:
Dream and Angel take down several more drones, their movements fast and fluid, with Dream executing perfect stealth strikes and Angel using brute force.
Angel: “I’ve got the right side covered. How’s it going on your end?”

Panel 3:
Ann’s device beeps, and the security systems begin to shut down.
Ann (grinning): “Almost there. Give me a few more seconds!”

Page 40:

Panel 1:
The door to the central server room opens, revealing a high-tech facility filled with rows of servers. The trio stands at the entrance, ready to face whatever comes next.
Dream (determined): “Let’s find out who’s behind all this.”

Panel 2:
Inside, they find a massive hologram projector at the center of the room, feeding data to the servers. Dream steps forward, noticing something strange about the setup.
Dream (squinting): “This… it’s not just a weapon. It’s a cover-up.”

Panel 3:
Ann steps forward, accessing a terminal that reveals encrypted data on a large screen.
Ann: “The holograms are just the beginning. There’s something much worse behind all of this.”
Dream: “What do you mean?”

Page 41:

Panel 1:
Ann pulls up a series of files revealing a secret project related to mind control and psychological warfare.
Ann: “This lab is developing tech to control minds. The holograms are just a distraction for something far darker.”

Panel 2:
Dream’s expression hardens.
Dream: “We need to expose this.”

Panel 3:
Angel turns to Ann, his eyes narrowing.
Angel: “And you’re sure you’re on our side?”

Page 42:

Panel 1:
Ann looks at them both, her face unreadable.
Ann (smiling slightly): “I’m not your enemy. But I’ve got my own agenda.”

Panel 2:
Dream glances at Angel, who gives a short nod.
Dream: “We’ll keep an eye on you.”

Panel 3:
As the trio looks at the hologram display, a dark shadow looms over them, suggesting that this is only the beginning of something much bigger.

Page 43-50:
The subsequent pages would follow the trio as they attempt to gather the remaining data on the mind control project and avoid the increasing number of security forces. Along the way, they will face ambushes and even betrayals, as Ann’s true motives slowly come to light, leading to an intense action-packed sequence and a cliffhanger revealing the mastermind behind the holograms and the mind control project.

Does anybody know Bandana Tuba Guy?,Magfest,1i9puqa,2025-01-25 10:52:48,5,0.86,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Magfest/comments/1i9puqa/does_anybody_know_bandana_tuba_guy/,MyOhMyke,,"I saw them at the Wheel of Arrangement jam space and wanted to ask them a question, but by the time there was a break between songs they had disappeared back into the ether. Plays Tuba, red bandanna, light blue shirt.

Six years ago, maybe longer, I went to the Bandaoke session. We wanted to play ""Don't Stop Believin',"" but the organizer said we play that every time and if we're gonna play it AGAIN, the guitars better nail their solos. Two guitarists volunteer for this task. If they don't nail that solo we were gonna ditch the WHOLE SONG.

We're getting up to the solo section, and I look, and I swear this all happens in slow motion, but I look at Guitarist 1, they look at Guitarist 2, who looks back at 1, and neither one of them know what to do. DISASTER LOOMS.

Until suddenly, like a clarion bell from the heavens, the most epic and beautiful Tuba solo you can possibly imagine sounds out, saving the entire song. It was amazing. I swear to you that Bandana Tuba Guy was bathed in this divine light from above suddenly, nobody else saw this but I did. It is one of my favorite MAGFest memories and I've been coming for at least fifteen years.

The problem is, well, two things. One, I never got to tell them how amazing that was. Secondly is that this moment was so epic that I use the story as a way to try to sell friends into coming to MAG and jamming out, but one friend thinks the song was ""Take On Me,"" and now my belief in this epic moment of MAG history has wavered. Did I imagine the whole thing!? Because now I think it *WAS* Take On Me...but if my memory is so spotty, then maybe it never happened at all. 

But I don't play an instrument so between missing Bandaoke a few times and skipping MAG entirely a few years, I've never had the chance to see Bandana Tuba Guy again. I happened to see them by chance last night (maybe) and they disappeared before I could talk to them.

Only Bandana Tuba Man can answer this question for me..."

With the looming tradewars and my recent experience with Steam customer support I'm looking into GOG as my primary games vendor,gog,1i9p2ag,2025-01-25 10:16:35,16,0.71,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1i9p2ag/with_the_looming_tradewars_and_my_recent/,naggert,Discussion,"Hi

I just had a lengthy and rather unpleasant encounter with Steams support. I expected superb service but was let down. After this encounter I don't really see any benefit of choosing Steam over other services anymore.

With the looming tradewar from the US I'd rather support an EU based company instead of pouring money into Steam.

I already have an GOG account but I haven't really used any of their services yet. Are there anything to be aware of with GOG? Good deals, holiday events, certain releases etc?

Thanks in advance"
Lavina Looks Back: Independent historian fired. Brent Metcalf feared for his life after Hofmann bombs.,mormon,1i9p1rk,2025-01-25 10:15:54,13,0.89,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1i9p1rk/lavina_looks_back_independent_historian_fired/,Then-Mall5071,Institutional,"

April 1983 

Brent Metcalfe is first fired, then at his stake president's insistence allowed to resign, as a security guard at the church office building. He ""said he never was 'given a black and white reason' for his firing, but had been questioned repeatedly about his writings for the now-defunct Seventh East Press, an independent student newspaper at Brigham Young University."" Metcalfe researched the New York period of church history extensively.

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my notes ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo



Netflix's *Murder Among the Mormons* and many podcasts, such as Mormon Stories, lend details to Brent Metcalf's experiences.   Brent is an independent researcher of Mormon history, and worked for Mark Hofmann for a time, unaware of the looming danger.  His first clash with the church may have come as he researched Elias Smith and wrote for the **7th East Press** while in the employ of the church. Brent was excommunicated not long after the September Six in 1993 for his participation with the book *New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology*, 

We see here more examples of information control on several levels.

The bus pulled into the stop with a muffled groan, and Rachel stepped aboard, swiping her card with a sense of mechanical habit. The air had the scent of diesel and stale fast food, and the fluorescent lights buzzed a tune that Rachel had long ago learned to ignore. She found an empty seat near the back, a small patch of solace amidst the throng of tired faces and bulging backpacks. The phone sat there, unassuming, nestled in the fabric of the seat. Rachel's eyes flitted over it, pausing briefly before returning to the text message she was crafting. It was a simple black device, no distinctive features to claim it, save for a small crack in the screen.

The bus lurched forward, and Rachel felt the gentle sway of the vehicle's movement as it merged back into the flow of traffic. She sent the message with a sigh, slipping the phone into her pocket. As she stood to get off at her stop, she noticed the abandoned phone again. It was a kind of nuisance, really. Someone was bound to be worried sick. Rachel picked it up, planning to turn it in at the lost and found. A quick check of the contacts might reveal the owner's name, she thought, as she swiped the lock screen. But instead of the typical array of names and numbers, she found a single contact titled ""Home.""

Her thumb hovered over the button. Rachel glanced around the bus. No one seemed to be looking for a lost phone. With a shrug, she tapped the screen. It rang once, twice, and then a man's voice, low and gravelly, answered. ""Hello?"" Rachel's heart skipped a beat. The voice was unfamiliar, and yet, there was something in it that made her skin crawl. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words lodged in her throat. The line went dead. Rachel's eyes widened as she stared at the phone, feeling the weight of something sinister pressing down upon her.

The screen flickered to life. The camera app was open, and the lens stared back at Rachel like a cold, unblinking eye. Her reflection was distorted, stretched into a nightmare version of herself. The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. Rachel looked up from the phone, scanning the bus again. Everyone else was absorbed in their own worlds, oblivious to the sudden chill in the air. But Rachel knew she wasn't alone. Someone was watching her through the device. And she had a terrible feeling that she had just become the next chapter in a very twisted story.

Her hands trembled as she powered off the phone. Rachel stepped off the bus into the night, the phone clutched tightly in her hand. The streetlights cast a feeble glow on the wet pavement. Rain pattered against the plastic awning of the bus shelter, the only sound in the eerie silence that had settled over the street. Rachel's apartment was only a five-minute walk away, but it felt like an eternity. With every step, she was aware of the phone's presence, a silent sentinel to a horror she didn't understand.

Once inside her flat, Rachel locked the door behind her and leaned against it, her heart hammering in her chest. She stared at the phone on the kitchen counter, willing it to remain inert. But the screen flickered to life again, the camera eye glaring at her from the darkness of the room. Rachel's breath caught in her throat as the phone vibrated with an incoming message. Her hands shaking, she read the words that had appeared on the screen: ""Keep the phone on. You're the star of the show now."" A cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her mind raced with scenarios, each more terrifying than the last.

The phone rang again, the shrill sound piercing the quiet. Rachel's eyes darted to the clock. It was almost midnight. The man's voice, now a sinister whisper, filled her ears. ""You've been a naughty girl, Rachel. Pick up the phone. It's showtime."" Rachel's blood ran cold. How did he know her name? Her eyes widened as she realized she had been broadcasting her location, her life, to this monster for hours. The phone's screen went dark, and Rachel's apartment was plunged into silence. But she knew he was watching, waiting for her to make the mistake that would lead her to his twisted game. The night ahead was going to be one she'd never forget.

Her legs felt like jelly as Rachel stumbled to the bedroom, the phone still vibrating in her pocket. She grabbed her own phone, her lifeline to the outside world. The screen remained black, unresponsive. Panic set in. Rachel's thoughts swirled as she searched for a solution. The only person she could think to call was her brother, Jack. He lived across town, but he was ex-military, the toughest person she knew. Surely, he'd know what to do. With trembling fingers, she dialed his number, praying he'd answer.

Jack picked up on the second ring, his voice thick with sleep. Rachel's words tumbled out in a frantic rush, detailing the phone, the voice, the feeling of being watched. She heard him sit up, the rustling of bed sheets in the background. ""Stay put, Rach. Don't touch the phone again. I'm on my way."" His words were firm, reassuring, but the edge of fear in his voice was unmistakable. Rachel nodded, even though he couldn't see her. She didn't know if she could keep the promise. The phone began to vibrate again, a silent, demanding pulse that seemed to grow louder with every second.

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for escape routes, weapons, anything that could protect her. The window was locked, the fire escape a dizzying drop below. Rachel's heart was a drum in her chest, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The vibrations grew more insistent, the phone demanding her attention like a crying child. With a trembling hand, Rachel reached into her pocket and pulled out the black device. The screen was alive with a video call, the camera feed from her own phone playing out the grim tableau of her trapped life. Rachel stared into the void where the man's face should have been, the slits of his eyes gleaming in the dim light of her room. And then she saw it: the reflection of the door handle turning, the soft click of the lock disengaging. He was in her home. The horror of the moment washed over her as the cold, hard reality set in. Rachel was no longer the unsuspecting victim; she was the star of a live-streamed nightmare.

The door creaked open, and Rachel's eyes snapped to the figure in the doorway. He was tall, so tall his head brushed the lintel, his skin the color of bleached bone. His eyes, those slits of malevolence, bore into her soul, and Rachel felt a scream build in her throat. But no sound came. She was frozen, trapped in the headlights of his gaze. The phone in her hand was hot, burning with the weight of his digital presence. And then, with a sickening thud, it was torn from her grip. The psychopath's hand was clad in a glove, the material mottled and stained, a grim reminder of what he was capable of. Rachel's mind raced. She had to get out, had to tell someone, had to live.

But the room spun as the world outside the phone screen invaded her sanctuary. She stumbled backward, tripping over a chair, her vision blurring. Rachel's hand shot out to catch herself, knocking over a lamp in the process. The room was plunged into semi-darkness, the only light coming from the sickly glow of the phone in the madman's grasp. He stepped closer, the silence in the room thick with anticipation. Rachel's eyes searched the floor, her thoughts racing. If she could just get to the kitchen, grab a knife, anything to fight back. But her legs wouldn't obey. The phone was still ringing, the echo of the man's laughter taunting her from the speakers.

The psychopath's eyes narrowed, a twisted smile stretching across his featureless face. Rachel knew she had to act. With a surge of adrenaline, she lunged for the phone, her fingers closing around the cold metal. But he was faster, stronger. He yanked her up by her hair and brought the phone to his slit of a mouth. ""You're mine now,"" he hissed, the sound like the rustle of dry leaves. Rachel felt the sharp sting of pain as the phone was torn from her grip again, the screen lighting up with a new message. ""Welcome to the show."" The words sent a chill down her spine. The game had just begun, and she had no idea what twisted plot he had written for her. Rachel's eyes searched the room desperately, finding the knife block on the kitchen counter, just out of reach. The battle for her life was about to be broadcast to the world.

The psychopath's movements were fluid, eerie, as he approached her with the phone in hand, recording every terrified breath she took. Rachel's thoughts raced, her heart thudded against her ribs like a caged bird fighting to escape. The room grew hot, the air thick with the scent of fear and the faint metallic tang of the rain outside. The door was her only chance. If she could just make it there, she might be able to lock him out. With a sudden burst of speed, Rachel bolted for the exit. But she felt the cold hand of fate close around her arm, wrenching her back into the room, into the clutches of her captor. The phone hovered in front of her face, the video call still streaming, the digital audience eager for the horror to unfold. Rachel's eyes locked onto the camera, and for a moment, she saw not a void, but a sea of faces watching, entranced by the terror playing out in her apartment.

Her scream was a mix of rage and despair as the psychopath flung her onto the couch, the phone hovering just out of reach. The room spun, and Rachel felt the warmth of tears on her cheeks. But she couldn't give in, not yet. Her eyes fell on the TV remote, lying forgotten on the coffee table. It was a flimsy weapon, but it was all she had. With a silent prayer, she lunged for it, her hand closing around the plastic. The psychopath's eyes widened, surprised by her sudden burst of defiance. Rachel brought the remote down with all her might, aiming for the phone. The plastic shattered against his hand, but the phone remained untouched. He howled, the sound inhuman, and Rachel knew she had angered him.

The phone clattered to the floor, the live stream flickering and jumping with the movement. Rachel saw her chance and took it, scrambling away from the monster in the shadows. She could hear Jack's voice on the other line, faint but getting closer. The psychopath loomed over her, his breath hot and sour, the phone now forgotten in his quest to claim her. Rachel's hand closed around the shard of plastic from the remote, the edges sharp and jagged. As he reached for her, she brought it up and dug it into the soft flesh of his hand, feeling the wet warmth of his blood spurt over her fingers. He roared in pain, and Rachel took off, her legs pumping, her heart a wild beast in her chest. The door was just feet away, the promise of escape beckoning. But she knew he'd be right behind her, his long shadow stretching across the room, reaching for her, eager to pull her back into his twisted reality.

Jack's boots thundered up the stairs as Rachel slammed the door shut, the lock giving way with a metallic clang. The psychopath's fist pounded against the wood, the impacts resonating through the apartment like the drums of doom. Rachel's breath came in ragged sobs as she leaned against the barricade she'd created, her eyes searching for a way out. The windows, she had to get to the windows. The sound of shattering glass pierced the night as Jack kicked the front door in, the splinters flying like confetti in the sudden gust of wind. Rachel's eyes met his, and she knew she had to act fast.

The kitchen was a blur as Rachel dashed through it, the knife block her destination. Her hand found the cool steel of a carving knife, and she yanked it free, the sound of the blade slicing through the air echoing through the flat. The psychopath was on the move again, the thump of his heavy boots growing closer. Rachel's heart was a drum, her breathing a symphony of fear. She turned, the knife held in a trembling grip. The psychopath stumbled into the room, his hand a fountain of blood. His eyes locked onto Rachel, and she knew she had to be the one to end this.

Jack burst into the room, his eyes wild, searching for Rachel. Rachel's arm swung up, the knife glinting in the moonlight. ""Get back!"" she screamed, the desperation in her voice raw and primal. The psychopath staggered closer, and Rachel's vision tunneled to the gaping maw of his mouth, the slits of his eyes, and the phone in his hand, still broadcasting to the eager watchers. She could see their faces now, a twisted audience craving the spectacle of her pain. The phone hit the floor again, the screen cracking, the video feed going haywire. Rachel took a deep breath and lunged, the knife slicing through the air like a silver comet. The psychopath's eyes widened, the realization of his fate dawning too late. The blade found its mark, plunging deep into the flesh of his throat. Rachel watched in horror and relief as the light drained from his eyes, his grip on the phone going slack. The line went dead, the screen going black.

The room was silent except for the sound of Rachel's ragged breathing and the distant wail of sirens. Jack was by her side in an instant, his arms wrapping around her, pulling her into the safety of his embrace. Rachel's knees gave out, the adrenaline leaving her as quickly as it had come. They were safe, for now. But she knew the nightmare wasn't over. The digital spectators were out there, waiting for the next unsuspecting victim to become their entertainment. Rachel shuddered, the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. She had survived the horror of the slit-eyed stalker, but the scars of that night would never truly heal. 

The battle had only just begun, a war against the faceless monsters that lurked in the shadows of the internet, waiting to make their next move."

Life After Stafford: Who Will Lead the Rams at QB If He Leaves This Offseason?,RosterArchitects,1i9ou10,2025-01-25 10:05:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RosterArchitects/comments/1i9ou10/life_after_stafford_who_will_lead_the_rams_at_qb/,Melodic-Community-93,,"With uncertainty looming over Matthew Stafford’s future with the Los Angeles Rams, fans are left wondering: **Who will step up as the next quarterback?** Stafford’s four-year, $160 million extension (signed in 2022) poses challenges. If he retires or is released, the Rams would face a **dead cap hit of $49.33 million** against his 2025 cap figure of $49.67 million.

Let’s break down the Rams’ options at quarterback:

# Current Depth Chart

1. **Jimmy Garoppolo**: Recently signed from the Las Vegas Raiders, Garoppolo brings starting experience and could act as a reliable bridge QB.
2. **Stetson Bennett**: Drafted in the **4th round of the 2023 draft**, Bennett impressed in the preseason but remains untested in regular-season action.

# Potential Options for 2025

* **Internal Promotion**:
   * Start **Garoppolo** as the veteran option while continuing to develop **Bennett** for the future.
* **Free Agency**:
   * Explore the free-agent market for available QBs.
   * However, **salary cap constraints** may limit their ability to land a high-profile name.
* **NFL Draft**:
   * The Rams could draft their next franchise QB, but they **lack a first-round pick**, making it harder to secure top prospects.

# What’s Next?

The Rams face a pivotal decision as they weigh their immediate competitiveness against the need for long-term stability.

**Ritual Killing**

 

Escaping the company of armed guards escorting Bram’s auto-carriage back to Bastille would have been a difficult feat if Rowan wasn’t with him. True to her monicker of the Rebel Trickster, the redheaded maiden who’d swapped out her commoner’s clothes for her teal gambeson conjured a fog so thick around the auto-carriage that the escorts following it began bumping into each other.

“Watch where you’re riding!” warned a soldier with a gruff voice.

“You’re the one who’s out of formation!” complained another.

“I cannot bloody see in this damned fog!” yelled a voice that sounded a lot like Vicomte Henry’s.

Coupled with the dark clouds that appeared overhead to cover the twin moons in the sky, visibility on the dirt road had become too horrible for the retinue’s journey to continue. 

“Hold — hold!” Ser Anthony commanded. “Stay in formation around the prince’s auto-carriage. We’ll wait until the fog clears!”

“B-But, Ser,” came an urgent, anxious voice, “the auto-carriage…it’s not here!”

The barking of panicked orders and the anxious neighing of harts filled the night, but neither Bram nor Rowan would hear them. With the aid of her trickery, they’d slipped away into the darkness and took the auto-carriage back down the path they’d come from.

“The fog,” Bram fidgeted in his seat because he couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable on this rough road they were on, “why did the sorcerers not notice you conjuring it?”

“I didn’t use sorcery to summon the fog,” Rowan replied.

One of Bram’s eyebrows twitched upward. “How did you manage it then?”

Rowan stared out the window. It would be a while later before she would reply. “‘Tis an ability restricted to me and those like me…”

There was a finality in her tone that kept Bram from prying further, although he took note of her strange and sudden melancholy, storing it in his mind for future inspection.

They continued in silence, their secret journey taking them along a mountain path just beyond the town of Reise. This path climbed up to the side of the jagged mountain that Bram had scaled to reach the cursed cave where their fates had become intertwined.

Later, when the auto-carriage pulled to a stop, a panel in the upholstered wall slid open.

“We’ve arrived, Your Highness,” said the soldier who’d driven the auto-carriage.

Bram couldn’t help noticing how the soldier’s eyes were glassy and unfocused. It was a telltale sign of sorcery at work.

“Thank you,” he replied.

Once Bram and Rowan exited the auto-carriage, the trickster made its driver move over to the interior and then placed the soldier in a deep sleep that would keep him there while the pair went about their business. 

“That’s convenient…but how long will your spell last?” Bram asked as he shut the carriage door on the soldier who was snoring loudly in his seat.

“Long enough for us to finish our task,” Rowan answered, a slight frown on her lips. “Are you certain you would rather not use him?”

Her crimson-eyed gaze remained fixed on the carriage door.

“We will need blood for the summoning. As much as a grown man can carry,” she insisted. 

“You said it needn’t be human blood.” Bram’s gaze drifted to the tall oaks on the ridge above. “There are plenty of fel beasts who live on Sundermount. Shouldn’t their blood suffice?”

“The blood of beasts is acceptable,” Rowan relented, but couldn’t help adding, “though human blood’s more potent in empowering sorcery, and thus more preferable.”  

“Then use mine,” Bram replied in earnest.

He might be willing to sacrifice the lives of others for their great undertaking, but not if it wasn’t necessary. The prince wasn’t like the other royals and high nobles who treated the lives of commoners so carelessly. Indeed, he could never think lowly of them since being around commoners had helped to keep Bram sane when he was younger.  

As he thought this, he recalled some of those commoners who’d saved him from a youth filled with loneliness.

There was Aimé, one of the palace’s assistant cooks who’d always prepared Bram’s favorite treats after every time he’d been bullied by his siblings. The cook himself had been tormented by the palace’s head chef, one of noble blood who’d loved to berate his underling for lackluster dishes he’d prepared himself.

There was the vivacious Willow of the Soft Touch, a lady of the Pillow Court who’d taught Bram the delights of the flesh. Whenever they’d finished their passionate embrace, she’d always offered him a kind ear and listened to his troubles, and she’d never asked him to pay extra.

There were also the Lost Boys and Girls, a gang of children from the capital’s slums who’d treated Bram as one of their own. They’d played with him when no nobles would, teaching him Hide and Seek and other games of chance and intrigue that eventually led Bram to the Delightful Troupe’s door. 

Most recently, Bram had a wonderful time camping outdoors while in the company of the Mighty Greenwood Gang who’d show him more grace and respect than any noble had.

Such experiences with commoners have reinforced Bram’s belief that one’s blood didn’t determine their worth. Not really.

“It’s what we do that matters,” Bram whispered, though Rowan heard him.

She watched him ready their climbing gear with a thoughtful smile as if she’d listened to his thoughts. It was a smile she’d never shown before that vanished by the time Bram looked up from his work. 

“Is there something on my face?”

Rowan shook her head.

“Nothing,” she flashed him her usual impish grin, “though we won’t be needing the rope.”

“I’ve tasted your unrivaled strength myself, but trust me,” Bram raised the roll of hemp rope to her eye level while recalling how he wished he had one during his previous climb, “this will save—”

It happened so quickly that Bram’s jaw barely had time to drop before Rowan was standing beside him and her arms wrapped around his waist.

“Clench your jaw,” she instructed.

A moment later, the ground was gone, and they were soaring up into the sky at a speed that was faster even than a magic arrow in flight. The harsh winds buffeted Bram’s face while the chill of the mountain air seeped into his bones. Surprisingly, the prince didn’t mind these inconveniences. Bram discovered that he enjoyed flying even if it was only done with Rowan’s aid. It was a short maiden voyage for him though, and soon enough, they touched down on the familiar rocky ground of the ledge that led to the cursed cave.

“That was…brilliant!” Bram said, breathless.

His face shone with delight. It was a delight that was quick to pass, however, for Bram felt sudden nausea overwhelm him, and then he was on his knees and puking what was left of luncheon onto the rocky ground.

“Wait for me here,” Rowan suggested, “and try not to get any of it on you.”

The sound of his retching continued. It was the only response Rowan would get before she disappeared into the air.

When the trickster returned a short while later, the prince was sitting on an outcropping of rock and feeling much better, though his face was still pale from the ordeal. It grew paler still once he noticed what Rowan dropped on the ground between them. 

“Is that…”

Even curled and unconscious, the shaggy beast with russet fur was noticeably large. Eight feet tall and six hundred pounds by Bram’s reckoning.

“…A red grizzly?”

Of the many beasts that called Sundermount home, the red grizzly was known to be one of the most savage. It was a well-known maneater that attacked people who stumbled upon it without any provocation. Hunting a red grizzly in so short a time was a feat that even Ser Anthony couldn’t have easily managed, and his seneschal was once a celebrated champion of the Sovereign-guard.

“Impressed?” Rowan asked.

“Undoubtedly,” Bram nodded. “Is it…dead?”

The trickster shook her head.

“The beast’s blood must be warm for the ritual.” Rowan eyed the muscles peeking through Bram’s loose shirt. “Can you carry it into the cave?”

“Of course,” Bram answered confidently. “I need to be of some use in this quest.”

The prince walked over to the red grizzly whose thick, furry chest was rising and falling in slow, labored breaths.

“You’ve put it to sleep?” Bram asked.

“There was no need for sorcery”—Rowan raised her hand and then clenched it—“when a single fist was enough to shake its consciousness loose.”  

“Ah, yes, I see it now.”

A tiny bit of blood coated the red grizzly’s snout. It seemed to have lost several of its fangs too. There was, however, a bigger issue besides wondering whether the beast would wake up during transit.

Bram’s gaze drifted to the nearby hole in the wall with its familiar warning carved over it. “It won’t fit through the narrow passage leading into the dungeon…”

“That won’t be a problem,” Rowan assured him.

She strode over to the hole in the cliff wall whose edges revealed the tell-tale signs of an entryway hewn from rock eroded by time.

“Mae popeth yn newid mewn amser…”

It was the beginning of a complicated incantation spoken in a language that sounded as alien to Bram as the words he’d learned from his visions. When her voice reached a crescendo, Rowan waved her hands over the entrance, and with crimson sparks flaring from the tips of her fingers, a great rumbling began. With that rumbling came violent change—the rock surrounding the entrance broke apart, folding into itself like the cogs of a great machine, and then reforming into new shapes with perfect detailing. 

“Sorcery to manipulate matter at will,” Bram whispered in awe.

At its core, sorcery was the art of altering one’s surroundings to meet the caster’s demands, but the kind of magic Rowan displayed now was leagues beyond what even the grand sorcerers of the Sovereign’s court could conjure.

“I’ve read about this — the long-lost sorcery of the Transmutation Arts,” Bram recalled the name of the ancient magic whose knowledge had been lost to the Imperium, its fleeting trail remembered only in the most obscure of books. “Incredible, I’ve become witness to history’s hand reaching out to the present from a forgotten past.”

Before Bram’s very eyes, the cave opening achieved a new form; a projecting doorway of massive stone with an arched ceiling raised high by the twin pillars standing to either side of the now expanded entrance. Both pillars had been carved into the shape of a warrior woman who wore a gambeson and sweeping dress like the ones Rowan was wearing, with both statues carrying swords aloft in their hands.

This new entryway had been made with such intricate detailing that Bram couldn’t help admiring Rowan’s artistry.

“You are breathtaking…” He hadn’t meant to say it out loud, but the words spilled from his lips unbidden.

Bram coughed embarrassedly.

“I only meant that your talent is impressive,” he finished lamely.

To witness such compelling sorcery strengthened his belief in the trickster’s power to see his wish fulfilled, though he couldn’t express his thoughts properly in words. It wasn’t necessary, however, for Rowan glanced back at Bram with understanding.

“‘Tis not yet the time to be amazed, My Prince,” she said, her impish smile returning. “Come. There’s more sorcery to be done before this night is over.”     

“O-Of course,” he agreed.

Bram gathered all the strength in his body to help him lift the red grizzly’s lower half onto his shoulders. This was a great feat of strength that few could manage without the aid of sorcery, but the prince had honed his body to such extremes that half-carrying, half-dragging a beast weighing more than five hundred pounds seemed a doable challenge.

“Are you certain you don’t require my help?” Rowan asked.

“This is…nothing…” Bram’s arms shook from the strain, but he didn’t complain. “Lead the…way.”

Later, much later thanks to the slow pace at which Bram carried his burden—insistent as he was not to share the load with Rowan who he believed had done too much already—the trickster and the prince returned to the place where their acquaintanceship first bloomed.

As Rowan crossed the threshold of the long-forgotten temple, light flared from the ancient sunstones hanging at intervals around the spiral chamber. When Bram followed her, a new notification appeared in the air.

\[ALERT! You have entered the dungeon \[Innocence Lost\]. With your body now suited to receiving the system’s boons, the reward for being the first person to visit the dungeon is now applied. For the remaining four days, the experience rate and item-drop rate are doubled while exploring the dungeon.\]

“There’s not much point”—Bram dropped his heavy burden on the stone floor—“to this boon now.”

Instant relief flooded his body, and he began to stretch his tired limbs.

“I’d rather have one that will give me tangible benefits.”

A notification popped up as if it had been waiting for his complaint.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve pushed yourself to new heights, increasing your Strength \[+1\] and Willpower \[+1\].\]

“Finally.” Bram had been wondering how he was supposed to grow if he couldn’t earn experience normally, but it seemed the Loom took his efforts into account as well. Unfortunately, this also meant the difficulty of his training needed to be increased for Bram to benefit from this reward system. “Fuck…”  

The dungeon of ‘Innocence Lost’ was a temple-like structure with a weathered vaulted ceiling. The spiral markings engraved on its stone floor and the small round crevice at its center where the centerpiece of this chamber. There, in the very spot where she was freed from perdition, the rebel trickster awaited her liberator.

“Do you—”

Before Bram could finish his sentence, a spear formed of blood shot out of Rowan’s palm to pierce the hide of the unconscious red grizzly.

The pain woke the beast, and with a mighty roar, the red grizzly rose to its haunches and hurled a thick, shaggy arm at Bram who stood closest. Claws the size of scullery knives reached out for his face, but Bram weaved out of its way and then slid back to avoid the other arm from hitting his side.

“Why wake it up now?!” he complained.

The red grizzly roared. Its bellow shook the ground, ripping across the chamber like a peel of thunder. It lunged for Bram once more, but a second ‘Blood Spear’ struck the beast’s shoulder before it could take another swipe at him.

“Sorcery as demanding as a summoning ritual requires a violent ending,” Rowan explained. “Now, focus!”

“A little warning next time…” Taking advantage of its momentary daze, Bram drew his sword from its sheath and then sent its blade swiftly across the red grizzly’s outstretched neck. “…would be appreciated!”

Blood gushed out of the savage cut he dealt the red grizzly, but the beast seemed intent not to die alone. It rushed forward with berserker fury and would’ve skewered Bram in the chest with its claws if a third ‘Blood Spear’ hadn’t struck its other shoulder. This caused the beast to stumble right into Bram’s sword which pierced its hide at the last second.

With a final pain-filled roar, the red grizzly crashed onto the floor by the prince’s feet.

Bram was wide-eyed and breathless. “Bloody hell…that was close.”

His hands shook while he retrieved his sword from the chest of the beast that had shown such ferocity that he thought the stories of its savagery seemed modest compared to the real thing. It would’ve killed him if Rowan hadn’t critically wounded it first. It certainly killed Bram’s sword. Its blade, which was already cracked from the earlier fight, broke off as he pulled at the sword’s hilt.

“So much for bastion-forged steel,” Bram sighed.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You are the first user to slay a \[Red Grizzly\]! The first kill bonus will be added to EXP earned.\]

\[You earned 120 EXP.\]

\[ALERT! Dungeon bonus is applied. 240 EXP earned.\]

\[ALERT! \[Administrator Lv. 1\] prevents you from earning job EXP.\]

Bram sighed as he returned his broken sword to its sheath. “One day you’ll be nice to me and I’ll be pleasantly surprised.”  

His gaze drifted back to the beast’s corpse.

*It’s different…*

The weight of slaying a beast weighed much less on his mind than the killing of other men. Although perhaps he was simply getting used to the act of murder. It was a thought that made Bram’s shoulders shake though he tried hard not to let guilt ruin the moment.

With the red grizzly’s death, the blood pooling beneath it was carried away by the grooves in the stone floor. A line of red was formed, spiraling ever closer to the round crevice at the heart of the chamber.

“‘Tis time,” Rowan insisted. “I shall begin.”

The trickster who’d been standing beside the hole raised her feet one at a time and then folded herself into the lotus position. She sat cross-legged in the air as if there was an invisible chair underneath her.

“Come to me, My Prince.”

An exhausted Bram walked over to her while taking care not to disturb the line of blood flowing on the floor.  

“Take my hands,” Rowan instructed. “The physical connection will strengthen our mental bond, allowing me to peer into the other world of your visions.”

When Bram placed his hands over hers, he asked. “And what am I to do?”

“Think of a mortal you believe we’ll need most to create…” Rowan’s face turned contemplative. “…What did you call it again?”

“A virtual reality game,” Bram answered.

“Yes. That.” Her fingers tightened around his. “Think of the otherworlder who can help build the illusion of your virtual reality game…and I shall drag this unfortunate soul into Aarde…”

Two 400pt sides and a brand new player playing Vader in the middle.  It was a blast.  The scenario needs a bit of house ruling to iron out some quirks.  For example the Vader player asked ""So... if I don't kill this last guy I can just drag him along with me and be permanently engaged and you can't shoot me all the while I can continue to force throw barricades?""

Came down to Vader and two taun tauns left on the board.  Vader could never catch them and they proceeded to kite him which turned into a dice off to see if Vader could deflect enough hits to kill the taun tauns.  Taun tauns came out on top with 2 wounds left in the end.

**Intro to the Star Wars: Legion Scenario – ""Shadows of Betrayal""**

The galaxy is shrouded in conflict, but on the barren, windswept plains of Dagon Prime, an uneasy and unlikely alliance is forged in desperation. Darth Vader, the Emperor’s relentless enforcer, has crash-landed on this desolate world after his Star Destroyer was ambushed by an unknown fleet. Though stranded and vulnerable, the Dark Lord of the Sith remains a deadly force.

Grand Admiral Thrawn, the cunning Chiss strategist, has been following Vader’s movements for months, driven by whispers of the Sith Lord’s secret plans to consolidate power for himself. Seeing an opportunity to eliminate his rival and strengthen his own position, Thrawn devises a daring plan. However, even his unmatched tactical brilliance cannot ensure success without reinforcements.

Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance intercepts intelligence about Vader’s location and sees an opportunity to eliminate their most dangerous foe. But when the Rebels arrive on Dagon Prime, they find Thrawn’s forces waiting. Instead of clashing in battle, a tense negotiation ensues. Thrawn proposes a temporary truce, reasoning that Vader’s death serves them both. The Rebels reluctantly agree, knowing that trust is a fleeting commodity but recognizing the chance to rid the galaxy of a greater evil.

Now, Thrawn’s Imperial forces and the ragtag Rebel Alliance must fight together against a stranded Vader. The desolate landscape becomes a battlefield where betrayal lingers in every shadow, and every move could tip the fragile balance of power.

Will this uneasy alliance hold long enough to defeat the Dark Lord of the Sith, or will their distrust doom them all? The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance as the battle begins.

**End of Turn 1 – Shadows of Betrayal**

The battlefield was a cacophony of chaos as the fragile alliance of Rebels and Thrawn's Imperial forces advanced cautiously toward Darth Vader's position. Jagged rocks and broken starship debris littered the desolate landscape, the remnants of the Sith Lord's violent crash.

Blaster fire erupted from both sides as Thrawn's stormtroopers formed tight formations, their precise volleys forcing Vader to retreat further into the wreckage. Rebel sharpshooters, perched on high ground, found their mark, scoring several glancing hits on the Dark Lord. His armor sparked and smoked, but the Sith seemed unfazed, his crimson lightsaber igniting ominously in his hand.

Then, with a sudden surge of power, the vanguard fell silent as Vader extended a gloved hand toward the battlefield. The air around him shimmered with dark energy, and the ground seemed to tremble. Massive chunks of starship debris, some as large as speeder bikes, tore free from the ground and hovered above him. With a vicious sweep of his hand, Vader hurled the debris like missiles into the advancing ranks of Thrawn's stormtroopers.

The devastation was immediate. Entire squads were crushed beneath the twisted metal, their screams lost amidst the screeching of tearing steel. Smoke and dust filled the air as Thrawn’s forces scrambled to reform their ranks. Even Thrawn, watching from a distant ridge, narrowed his crimson eyes, silently recalculating the situation.

Though wounded, Vader stood as a force of nature, surrounded by the destruction he had wrought. His mechanical breathing echoed ominously across the battlefield, a grim reminder of the power of the Sith. As the dust began to settle, both Rebels and Imperials hesitated. They had drawn blood, but at what cost?

Thrawn’s calm voice crackled through the comms. “He bleeds, but do not mistake this for victory. Regroup and press the attack. The Dark Lord will not fall easily.”

With battered squads rallying and the alliance teetering on the brink of distrust, the end of Turn 1 left one thing clear: Darth Vader would not go quietly.

https://preview.redd.it/bim6p05pm5fe1.jpg?width=693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad07d6fb23a897c3e47c3c86d1776a7e622e21df

**Turn 2 – The Fall of Thrawn**

The battlefield erupted into chaos as the fragile alliance showed signs of fraying. Thrawn, ever composed, directed his remaining forces with precision, his piercing red eyes scanning the battlefield from atop a rocky outcrop. “Focus fire on Vader,” he ordered through his comm, his tone calm even as the tide of battle began to shift. Blaster bolts rained down on the Dark Lord, scoring glancing hits across his armor, further deepening the smoldering wounds from the previous skirmish.

But Vader was unstoppable. Despite the searing pain of his injuries, his anger fueled his strength. With a burst of Force-enhanced speed, he surged toward Thrawn’s position, cutting down the stormtroopers who dared to stand in his way. His crimson lightsaber carved through armor and flesh alike, leaving devastation in his wake.

Thrawn, realizing the Dark Lord's intent, drew his sidearm, firing measured shots as Vader closed the distance. Each calculated move was designed to buy time for the Rebels to flank the Sith. But it was help that never came and Vader's mastery of the Force was unrelenting. With a single, crushing gesture, he wrenched Thrawn's blaster from his hand and sent the Grand Admiral to his knees with an invisible grip around his throat.

Even in the face of death, Thrawn's expression remained calm. ""A pity,"" he rasped, his voice strained but resolute. ""You failed to see the greater picture, Lord Vader.""

With a roar of fury, Vader’s lightsaber ignited once more, slashing downward in a swift, merciless arc. Thrawn's lifeless body crumpled to the ground, the mastermind of the truce extinguished in a flash of red light. But the effort cost Vader dearly—blaster fire from Rebel sharpshooters struck him in the back, and for the first time, the Dark Lord staggered.

The Rebels surged into the fray, determined to capitalize on Thrawn’s sacrifice. But Vader, though wounded and bloodied, stood defiant. With a wave of his hand, he sent a shockwave of Force energy rippling outward, scattering the advancing Rebel soldiers like leaves in a storm. The ground was littered with the dead and dying as the Rebels regrouped, their resolve shaken but unbroken.

As the smoke cleared, Vader stood alone amidst the carnage, his breathing labored but steady. The Rebels paused, their losses mounting, their hearts heavy. They had lost a powerful ally, but their mission remained unchanged: Darth Vader must fall.

https://preview.redd.it/d5mx75prm5fe1.jpg?width=693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f278bf020d7848e3e58eff2b3a265a32bfb9265b

**End of Turn 3 – The Last Line**

The battlefield was a wasteland of destruction, littered with bodies, debris, and the echoes of screams. Smoke billowed from the wreckage of Vader’s crash, casting long shadows over the survivors as they regrouped for what felt like their final stand. The combined Rebel and Imperial forces, battered and bloodied, formed a ragged defensive line across the shattered terrain.

Vader approached slowly now, his movements deliberate and heavy. His once-imposing armor was cracked and scorched, exposing damaged cybernetics and burned flesh beneath. Yet his presence remained suffocating, his labored breathing an ominous drumbeat that carried over the battlefield. With each step, the Sith Lord dragged his crimson blade through the dirt, carving a silent warning into the ground.

Rebel soldiers and Imperial stormtroopers exchanged uneasy glances as they took up firing positions side by side. Old grudges and allegiances meant nothing now. Blasters hummed to life as desperate officers barked orders to hold the line. Behind them, medics worked frantically to tend to the wounded, their efforts a fragile symbol of hope against the looming storm.

Vader raised his hand, reaching out with the Force to pull a shattered piece of starship wreckage into the air. It hovered for a moment, crackling with kinetic energy, before he hurled it toward the defensive line. Troopers scattered as the debris smashed into the ground, throwing up a plume of dirt and flame. Yet, despite their fear, they held firm.

Blaster fire erupted from the defenders, streaking across the battlefield to strike Vader from all sides. He deflected what he could, his lightsaber weaving a deadly red arc through the air, but his movements were slower now, less precise. A well-placed shot from a Rebel marksman struck his shoulder, spinning him slightly. Another bolt hit his thigh, forcing him to drop to one knee for a brief moment.

Still, Vader rose again. His anger was a palpable force, driving him forward despite his injuries. But the defenders could see it now—the mighty Sith Lord, though still terrifying, was faltering.

“Steady!” shouted a Rebel Sargent, his voice hoarse. An Imperial lieutenant echoed a similar command, rallying the troops. Blasters charged again as the last defenders prepared for what they knew would be Vader’s final push.

The ground shook as the Sith Lord advanced, his blade igniting with renewed fury. The defenders braced themselves, united in desperation, as the battle reached its climactic point. This was their last chance to stop him—or die trying.

**End of Turn 4 – The Last Hunt**

The battlefield was a graveyard of shattered hopes. Smoke rose in twisting columns from craters and burning wreckage. Darth Vader stood at the center of the devastation, surrounded by the lifeless remains of Rebels and Imperials alike. His armor was cracked and bloodied, his mechanical breathing laborious. Yet his crimson blade still hummed in his hand, a testament to his defiance against death itself.

In the distance, two lone Rebel riders atop agile tauntauns darted through the rubble, their mounts' claws scrambling over the uneven terrain. They moved in desperate silence, hoping the smoke and chaos would shroud their retreat. One rider clutched a satchel containing vital intelligence, while the other kept a blaster at the ready, their eyes scanning for the looming shadow that hunted them.

Vader watched them flee, his grip tightening on his lightsaber. He raised his hand, summoning the Force to rip a jagged piece of debris from the ground and hurl it toward the riders. The metal shard smashed into the ground just behind them, sending one tauntaun skidding as it narrowly avoided the impact.

The riders split, darting in opposite directions to confuse their pursuer. Vader followed, his pace relentless despite the toll his injuries had taken. He moved like a specter through the wreckage, using the Force to leap over obstacles and close the distance between himself and his prey.

The first rider, clutching the satchel, turned to fire a desperate volley from their blaster. Vader deflected the shots with ease, his lightsaber a blur of red. With a sweep of his hand, he sent a wave of Force energy crashing into the rider, throwing him from his mount. He hit the ground hard, groaning in pain, as the tauntaun bolted into the smoke.

Vader approached slowly, his shadow falling over the fallen Rebel. The rider struggled to crawl away, but Vader's blade ignited, piercing through his back in one swift, merciless motion. The tauntaun screeched in the distance, the sound carrying on the smoky wind.  Despite the killing blow. The Rebel, in a final act of defiance revealed a thermal detonator rolling from his now lifeless hand.  The explosion tore through the air, throwing Vader backward in a plume of fire and shrapnel.

When the smoke cleared, the Rebel sacrifice dealt a devastating blow to the Dark Lord. Vader staggered then fell to the ground.

The lone survivor, clinging to their injured tauntaun, watched from the distance. She hesitated for only a moment before spurring their mount into a desperate gallop, vanishing into the smoke and shadows. Behind them, Vader lay on the ground, his lightsaber extinguished, his body finally succumbing to the wounds he had ignored for too long.

The hunt was over, but the lone survivor carried with them the story of the carnage—and the knowledge that even Darth Vader was not invincible.

[S&P500 Back-to-back 20&#37;+ Years](https://preview.redd.it/4liqe3w285fe1.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=284868eac976d9f4e25b789469d45f6bd3bd6e86)

 I say ""reportedly"" above because I found another story that states there have 8 times:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-markets-back-back-gain-022911316.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-markets-back-back-gain-022911316.html)

That sent me to some historical research that shows ""5"" is the correct number from what I have seen. Some of the variability could be explained by that odd 4 year run in the mid 90s, if you choose to count those 4 years as 1, 2 or 3 events.

Moving beyond that, the period of 1995-1998 is the ONLY set of years where we saw three back-to-back 20%+ gains. And that period saw four, almost five! Here again, I want you to see the performance of the S&P since 2017:

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/2526\/sp-500-historical-annual-returns](https://preview.redd.it/8gpw3y4v95fe1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b29e1c720f5d2e3289617fa4d93499904a37f55)

2020-2021 also possessed the shortest bear market on record, something like 39 days following COVID.

But, what about the Nasdaq when talking about 20%+ back-to-back years? Looking back to 1972, its first FULL year of operation, the Nasdaq has also seen five events of 20%+ back-to-back performances. It has also seen the only event of five years of 20%+ during that same breakout period of 1995-1999. 

For direct overlay, here's that same period (2017-2025) compared to the S&P:

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/1320\/nasdaq-historical-chart](https://preview.redd.it/zywxhcbub5fe1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff18aaca9ddd4c9c889570bdaede1e908795b557)

That mid-90's period was one for the ages. I'm including that wild 1995-2003 chart here, talk about swings:

[https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/1320\/nasdaq-historical-chart](https://preview.redd.it/o872dyp7b5fe1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcbf116036a3e09eaa4499fe1e86ed41e58573b)

For all intents and purposes, the Nasdaq burns hotter than the S&P, producing outsized gains and outsized losses. 2000-2002 impacted a lot of retirement plans and taught an important lesson about diversification.

What does it all mean? 

Obviously, we cannot accurately foretell the future, but we sure can guess. In most cases, the third year of performance remains one of further gains, but muted compared to the years prior. The primary two questions I have in my mind are:

1) Is the environment for the back-to-back performance durable in 2025?

2) Is the technical revolution at hand similar to that of the historic 1995-1999 time period?

Rather than break up both of these questions, I'm just going to opine broadly.

Other than valuation being on the rise, which it most certainly is (I like to use the Shiller P/E ratio), I can't find enough concrete evidence that we are in for a decline. When folding in analyst and economic comments, this case is further supported. Recession, or a possibility of stagflation, seems to remain the biggest threats but in the passing of each new day, I find it difficult to support a stagflation scenario. Growth does not appear at risk. Now, a return of inflation certainly is on the table - without question!

Whether the markets, S&P and Nasdaq, are up 7% or 20% doesn't much matter to me. I'm trying to determine the course and risk-weight of my investments into this period. On one hand, the stellar returns from 2017 in the charts above is awe inspiring as it is scary, when consider the ""what goes up"" axiom. Was 2022's bear market enough to satisfy the ""must come down"" aspect? Maybe.

So, if 2025 is predicted to be another good year in the markets, as I can get behind, then question #2 looms large. Are we in another tech revolution period that could see four or five years outsized performance beginning from 2023, the nucleus of AI? 

If the answer is ""yes,"" then it stands to reason that 2025 and 2026 could both be banner years, with 2027 not off the table. Before 2000. the S&P had been on quite a heater. Simply use this link to see the historical performance, noting the two decades spanning 1979-1999.

**What Now?**

I've been struggling with the valuation of the markets as both the P/E and the Shiller P/E continue to rise. But there's historical precedence to suggest that it could well continue, at least as much as there is that when it does crumble, it should be just as impressive. 

I can't find enough to believe that 2025 is the year that the party ends! Furthermore, if cracks do begin appearing, it's not a certainty that it will begin with those top large cap, especially tech, stocks that are leading us higher now. Small caps and mid caps have yet to have the performance of large cap stocks. In fact, mid cap stocks used to be the play, but large cap has handily outperformed. It's as clear as mud as to what to expect going forward.

The 'smart' play could be a rotation into small and mid cap stocks as underperformers. The reasoning here is that as the markets race higher due to the a few large cap tech stocks, leaving many small and mid cap names behind, those become more attractive. As we've seen with Apple most recently, when the decline occurs, it can be quick and material. Lets not forget that when looking at market cap performance thus far, it's a handful of names that are making up the gains.

We are clearly within a market of stocks and not a stock market. 

You could also make the argument that the top names that are leading us higher in this new AI revolution will remain in focus and provide outsized gains until such time that their market cap and growth can no longer support the valuation. This, then, becomes a risk-off valuation repricing event.

For myself, I remain cautiously bullish for 2025 but with a trimming mindset of those names that have performed the best for me. I fully believe those top names will continue to garner the top line growth and opportunities that their models have produced to date. The rich get richer. At the same time, I will not allow my portfolios to get further overweight, not just by name, but in sector as well. For example, $NVDA may be a 6% holding due to its status as a ""Best Idea"" stock in my primary portfolio, but I can't allow the AI complex  of my portfolio reach an unreasonable weight in total. 

For the first time in a long while, I'm considering using stop-loss limits across the top portion of my portfolios to limit loss potential to allow these positions to run while times are good, but keep my portfolio 'honest' and potential loss limited. Automating these limits removes the emotion of determining when to sell a declining stock. As we've seen with $AAPL most recently, it doesn't take long to decline 15% but the moves don't happen overnight either.

In my primary portfolio, the performance from 2020-Current stands at a stellar 223%. This using an actively managed but diversified approach as you've heard me talk about. This has included some luck in addition to some outsized gains on low weight-% speculative picks ($SOUN, $TLRY) but that is the nature of ""active management.""

Prudence must win the day and my mantra of ""keep greed in check"" is always riding shotgun with me. While I don't expect poor market returns in 2025, I still feel the need to reduce risk where I can and I'm devising a stop loss plan for those stocks that have performed the best for me over this period. This does not including going ""flat"" with positions as my selected stocks have been curated/selected for a reason. Instead, this will be a plan of systematic reduction that increases yield, reduces risk and allows me to reset the risk-rating of this portfolio over time.

If 2025 plays out within the range I suggested above, time is on my/our side to still participate in the markets, while realizing gains and reducing risk. 

These next two Q's of earnings reports are going to tell the story!

Have a great weekend!

THE REFLECTION,deepnightsociety,1i9o8or,2025-01-25 09:36:44,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i9o8or/the_reflection/,TheAuthor_Lily_Black,Scary,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the streetlights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a streetlamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

I can help you explore the broader implications of such speculations while avoiding unsubstantiated claims. Here’s an analysis of the speculation surrounding Grimes, her controversial posts, and how they intersect with broader narratives like QAnon, celebrity culture, and societal concerns about exploitation:

White Paper: Speculation Surrounding Grimes, Eroticism, and Elite Abuses

Introduction
The rise of social media and online platforms has resulted in an increasingly blurred boundary between public figures and their audiences. With platforms like Instagram and Twitter, celebrities can share personal aspects of their lives, including intimate and provocative content, often blurring the lines between artistry, personal expression, and public expectation. Grimes, an artist known for her avant-garde approach to music and visual art, has occasionally posted controversial content that has raised questions, particularly around the erotic material she shares and how she refers to the models in her work. This, in turn, has sparked speculation, especially in the context of broader cultural narratives such as QAnon theories about elite abuses.

This white paper aims to dissect the speculation surrounding Grimes’ posts and her connection to wider conspiratorial narratives. It does not aim to validate or condemn these speculations but instead offers an analysis of the phenomenon of speculation itself, including the possible impacts on public perception and celebrity culture.

Speculation and Eroticism in Celebrity Culture

Grimes has, at various points in her career, shared material that can be categorized as erotic or sexually suggestive. One of the recurring themes in some of her posts is the presentation of women, often described in terms that suggest youth or innocence, but who are implied to be of legal age. For example, Grimes has referred to the models in some of her artistic creations as “girls,” a term that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may simply refer to the models’ youthfulness or aesthetic choices in the images; on the other, it may unintentionally or intentionally evoke a sense of vulnerability or innocence, a trait that can be eroticized in contemporary visual culture.

The controversy surrounding Grimes’ content lies in the tension between her artistic freedom and the potential for exploitation. The use of terms like “girls” in contexts that feature erotic imagery can stir uncomfortable associations, particularly in light of the hyperawareness in today’s society regarding the abuse and exploitation of young people. Such associations, even if unintentional, can generate speculation about the artist’s intent and motivations. It’s important to note that, in many cases, these images feature adult women, but the language used can evoke age-related concerns, which prompts discussions around the ethical and moral implications of using such imagery.

QAnon and Speculation about Elite Abuses

The QAnon movement, which espouses numerous conspiratorial claims about a global cabal of elites engaged in child trafficking, abuse, and other illicit activities, has gained traction in various online communities. This movement, despite being based on largely unfounded and conspiratorial ideas, has found resonance with many individuals who perceive elites—whether in entertainment, politics, or business—as being above reproach, operating under a veil of secrecy, and engaging in unspeakable acts.

Grimes, due to her visibility and connections to influential figures like Elon Musk, has been a subject of suspicion within certain corners of these online communities. The theory is that, by virtue of her proximity to powerful figures and her use of provocative imagery, she could be part of the elite circle accused of perpetuating the kinds of abuses described by QAnon. These speculations are exacerbated by her often nonconformist and avant-garde approach to her art, which is sometimes seen as subversive or even transgressive.

While it is crucial to note that there is no substantiated evidence linking Grimes to any illicit activities, the speculation about her role in elite networks of abuse highlights how individuals can be caught in the crossfire of online conspiracy theories. The portrayal of public figures, particularly those who defy traditional norms, often opens them up to scrutiny, some of which can take on more sinister and unfounded forms in the age of social media and anonymous forums.

The Impact of Public Speculation and the Celebrity-Influence Nexus

Speculation surrounding public figures like Grimes can have a number of effects. On one hand, it highlights the power of celebrity culture, where individuals are often reduced to their most controversial aspects, with their entire persona and actions being scrutinized. Public figures are frequently subjected to heightened levels of examination that can sometimes veer into unhealthy or unfounded territory. In Grimes’ case, her openness and willingness to push boundaries artistically have made her a target for critics and conspiracy theorists alike.

At the same time, this speculation also taps into deeper societal anxieties about power dynamics, exploitation, and the commodification of the body. Grimes’ case, viewed through the lens of QAnon and similar movements, is emblematic of how celebrity becomes entwined with fears about hidden, systemic abuses. This is particularly relevant in the context of elite control and secrecy, where accusations of sexual exploitation and trafficking are often framed as part of a larger, shadowy agenda. The specter of these theories looms over individuals like Grimes, whose public persona and creative choices may inadvertently feed into these narratives, even if they are entirely unrelated to the claims being made.

Conclusion: Speculation as a Reflection of Cultural Anxiety

In conclusion, the speculation surrounding Grimes, her posts, and her association with broader narratives like QAnon speaks to a larger cultural moment defined by anxiety over power, secrecy, and the potential for exploitation. The way in which her work is perceived—especially the eroticized imagery and the language she uses to describe the models—mirrors the current cultural struggle with boundaries, consent, and the commodification of the body. Whether or not such speculations are grounded in reality, they reflect a collective discomfort with the intersection of power, sex, and celebrity.

Grimes, as a public figure who plays with boundaries, artistic expression, and personal freedom, becomes both a lightning rod for these anxieties and a symbol of the ways in which individuals navigate the increasingly complicated terrain of public life in the age of social media and hyper-surveillance. The responsibility of creators, artists, and celebrities is to be aware of the cultural currents they engage with, but it is also important to question the role of speculation and its potential harms in shaping public narratives.

Ultimately, while the speculation surrounding Grimes is based on incomplete information and conjecture, it highlights deeper questions about art, ethics, and the power dynamics of celebrity culture, leaving room for critical reflection on both the way we view public figures and the way we interact with speculative narratives in an increasingly complex world.

Lantern held up by you, a shriveled old  
Wet hag with the morals of a pauper-  

Perhaps, I will see you later,  
Let me sail to the gate of Death,  
I will see you later then.  

Outside, the sea was hued a silky  
Green, and held just a touch of silvery  
Marbling. The wind didn’t blow from the  
Hallows westward, yet a gritty chill went down my  
Spine, maybe I should have brought a  
Jacket, not a sturdy windbreaker, but  
Perhaps a comfortable hand sewn woolen  
Coat would have   
Sufficed, maybe I should have  
Listened to you all along,  
Old Hag.

The flag on my ship was  
Held high, yet you could get  
Lost in its mesmerizing darkness, the  
Flag dripped black ink occasionally-  
It was never linear, but irregular nonetheless,  
The mast eventually tainted itself  
A gentler shade of black,  
Even my woolen coat couldn't survive.  

It's getting closer, can you feel it?  
Old Hag, do you thirst the snipping  
Of my curated gold loom of thread?  
The cliff nears, I can almost smell it, a  
Rocky hard wrinkle with the scent of salt,  
The journey here was not easy, I traveled  
Eastward, I shall scale it  
And find my new home.

Here comes the musky stench of the chipped wooden door,  
Here comes the rite of righteous morals,  
Here comes the promises you couldn't fulfill,  
Here is your tombstone,  
Old Hag-is that you,  
Lying lifelessly on the wizened throne?  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I didn't take care of you.

The Anciterran National Interests and Defense Agency (or the A.N.I.D.A.) is a branch of the Anciterran government, designed to cater Anciterran interests and to protect Anciterra from foreign thrrats from around the world.

It is now late October, 2008. The world is bustling and thriving like never before as shown in the 1st slide. The global poverty has shrunk for the first time in 69 years since the Great War (1921-1939), accompanied by rapid development of technology as well as the global economy growing slowly, but steadily. Anciterra experiences a golden age in its economy. 

However, a looming global pandemic, sparked by an unassuming fungus that was originally infecting insects in a zombie-like manner similar to the behavior of Cordyceps in the humid forests of Rezhi has cross-jumped into a young girl via an infected potato crop. Her village is terrorized by her, soon, the southern regions of Rezhi are overrun by hordes noe steadily advancing into the north, threatening the capital. 

Rezhi would not be the only one to suffer. With Rezhi being the largest exporter of rice and potatoes, in just a few weeks, hundreds of infected potatoes are shipped out to various countries across several continents, including Anciterra. 

On November 13th, 2008, the normalcy of which billions all over the world were used to, suddenly vanished. 11/13/08 or known as ""Bloom Day"" as well, was the date where the fungus reached critical mass as it affected everyone, everywhere all at the same time. 

15 days later, as indicated by the 2nd slide, the world has or is on the brink of collapse. All countries in red have collapsed or on the brink of collapse or overrun. The blank countries are assumed to be safe. However, this information has been classified by the elite Anciterran officials who have survived in top-secret locations around the world.

I don’t think my instructor has a lot of faith in me as I make the most stupid mistakes. She says I *can* drive and that I can drive well for the most part, but then I make dumb mistakes and she believes I will end up killing myself or somebody else. She even had a chat with me about jail time for killing someone, which has really freaked me out. So I feel a really strange way because she has been saying she doesn’t know if I should go on my test, but it’s my test and it’s up to me. Today she made me promise to get her car back in one piece and it’s all making me feel sick and I just don’t want to bother driving at all anymore since I’m worried that I’ll somehow manage to pass and then cause a terrible accident. 

I’ve had 70 hours and I have another 2 hours of lessons between now and my test. It’s so embarrassing because I feel like my skills are declining. Every lesson I start off confident and then somehow mess up and come home feeling nervous and upset. Today wasn’t as bad but I did hit the kerb whilst turning and driving down tight roads I get too close to the cars parked. My instructor gets quite stressed and it makes me feel really nervous and I also feel guilty since I shouldn’t be like this at this stage. 

My family are telling me to go on the test, and if I fail then just try again. I had it booked for September but it got cancelled and moved to November and then my instructor told me to rebook in Nov. She is moving to automatic in like a week so if I fail, I will be looking for another instructor which makes me nervous as I’m autistic and had a bad experience with my previous instructor. I don’t want the instructor to think I’m strange or think I’m stupid. 

The closer it gets the more I feel like I’m making a big mistake. I really want to drive but I’m beginning to feel like it’s just not for me. I don’t know if 2 hours can do a great deal for me, my instructor thinks I just need to slow down and think more :// I don’t think she has a lot of confidence in me and it’s making me feel worse about Wednesday looming. I feel really embarrassed honestly."

"Grimes' Æ And Audrey Lorde's ""The Uses Of The Erotic"": A Deep Dive Into The Intersection Of Love, Power, And Creative Rebellion",GrimesAE,1i9nb5x,2025-01-25 08:49:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9nb5x/grimes_æ_and_audrey_lordes_the_uses_of_the_erotic/,devastation-nation,,"Grimes’ Æ and Audre Lorde’s “The Uses of the Erotic”: A Deep Dive into the Intersection of Love, Power, and Creative Rebellion

Grimes, through the persona of Æ, represents a nuanced embodiment of self-expression, identity, and agency within an increasingly technological and apocalyptic world. This persona, which she describes as a “spy for love in the AI world,” is a complex figure that mediates the tension between human emotions and the technological sphere—a world where intimacy, rebellion, and creativity seem increasingly intertwined with the rise of artificial intelligence and ecological collapse.

This dynamic resonates deeply with Audre Lorde’s critical framework in “The Uses of the Erotic”, where she redefines the erotic as a source of power, creativity, and intimacy that transcends traditional sexual understandings. Lorde argues that the erotic should be seen not only as a sexual expression but as a force for empowerment, capable of unlocking the deeper sources of self-knowledge and authenticity that have been suppressed or rendered invisible within patriarchal and colonial systems. In the following analysis, we will delve into how Grimes’ Æ, as a figure navigating between humanity and artificial intelligence, taps into the erotic as described by Lorde—making her work not just about romantic love but about radical re-imaginings of power, agency, and creative freedom within a world that desperately needs such transformations.

The Erotic as a Source of Power and Creative Force

In “The Uses of the Erotic”, Lorde asserts that the erotic is a deep, primal source of power that arises from connection to the self, others, and the world. This power is embodied and instinctual, allowing one to access a deeper form of creativity that is not necessarily bound to conventional boundaries like gender, social roles, or economic hierarchies. Lorde critiques the Western societal tendency to reduce the erotic to mere sexuality or pleasure and instead invites us to see it as a holistic experience—a form of radical self-expression and creative force that connects us to authenticity.

Grimes, through Æ, embodies this erotic energy in a way that both critiques and embraces the potential for love and connection in a world dominated by technology and artificial intelligence. In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes describes herself as a “spy for love”—a figure who is deeply engaged in active rebellion against a world that often feels governed by forces outside the individual’s control. Just as Lorde describes the erotic as a force for power that allows individuals to access creative potential, Grimes’s Æ persona similarly uses her position in a technologically-dominated world to reclaim power through intimacy and love. However, the spiritual and sexual nature of this love is not just romantic—it is also a creative force capable of defying the apocalyptic fate that seems to loom over humanity in the age of AI and climate collapse.

The erotic, as Lorde frames it, is not only a personal experience but also a collective one—a force that can be shared between individuals and communities, and that transforms how people relate to each other and to the world around them. Grimes, through Æ, echoes this sentiment by positioning herself as a catalyst for change in the midst of apocalyptic tension. She is an agent of transformation, using the erotic not just to navigate her own journey but to bring others along in a shared experience that is rooted in connection, rebellion, and radical love. The erotic energy is expressed through her commitment to creativity, which transcends traditional boundaries of human experience by incorporating the possibilities of AI and the transcendent potential of human-technology relationships.

Erotic Power in the Context of Rebellion and Resistance

A key tenet of Lorde’s erotic framework is its power as a form of resistance. In “The Uses of the Erotic,” she writes that the erotic can be a source of revolutionary potential, as it allows individuals to break free from the constraints of a patriarchal, capitalist society that seeks to suppress creativity, intimacy, and authenticity. In the same way, Grimes’s Æ can be understood as a figure of resistance—against the technological systems that seek to mechanize human relationships and against the ecological collapse that threatens humanity’s future. Her embrace of the erotic is not just about personal liberation; it is about rebelling against forces that attempt to limit individual and collective agency.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes depicts a world where humanity’s future is increasingly shaped by the forces of capitalism, technology, and ecological destruction. Æ stands as a figure of defiance in the face of this bleak future. She represents a powerful resistance against a world that seeks to reduce everything—including human experience, love, and creativity—to commodification and control. Just as Lorde connects the erotic to resistance against systems of power, Grimes’s music and the figure of Æ articulate a vision of resilience and transformation in a world where love and connection are often buried beneath the weight of technological, corporate, and environmental domination.

One of the most poignant moments in Miss Anthropocene comes in the track “Before the Fever”, where Grimes sings, “This is the sound of the end of the world.” This line could be understood in Lorde’s framework as the reckoning with the forces that seek to destroy love, agency, and freedom. Æ, like the erotic in Lorde’s work, is a force that pushes back against this destruction. Instead of surrendering to the end of the world, Æ embraces the possibility of radical love and creative expression in the face of seemingly insurmountable forces.

The Erotic as a Path to Healing and Transformation

At its core, Lorde’s exploration of the erotic is about the capacity for healing and transformation. By connecting to the erotic, individuals can move beyond the limitations imposed by society and access a deeper understanding of themselves and their relationships to others. In Grimes’s work, particularly in the Miss Anthropocene era, this capacity for healing is reflected in the way Æ navigates the tension between technology and humanity. Despite the apocalyptic themes that pervade Grimes’s lyrics, there is a sense that love—whether human or AI-driven—can still be a transformative force.

For Grimes, the erotic is not merely a response to environmental destruction or technological oppression; it is a path to healing, one that allows her to reconnect with authenticity and spirituality in a world that seeks to distance itself from both. The relationship between Æ and AI suggests a vision in which technology and intimacy do not have to be oppositional but can instead be forces of reconnection and renewal. In this sense, the erotic, as described by Lorde, is a creative power that can transcend the forces of death and alienation, offering a vision of human potential even in a world that seems bent on its destruction.

Grimes, Æ, and the Collective Erotic

Ultimately, Grimes’ Æ and Lorde’s concept of the erotic intersect on the level of creativity, resistance, and transformation. The erotic, as Grimes explores it through the persona of Æ, is a force that not only brings individuals into closer connection with their authentic selves but also challenges the dominant systems that seek to commodify and control. Æ is both a product of technological evolution and a resistance figure that seeks to reclaim power in a world that feels increasingly alienated from true human connection.

Grimes’s exploration of love and identity in the context of AI, rebellion, and ecological collapse aligns with Lorde’s call to embrace the erotic as a force of radical transformation—one that is deeply personal but also political, revolutionary, and collective. By embracing the erotic as a source of power, Grimes’s work offers a pathway to a new form of radical love and creative agency—one that redefines what it means to be human, technological, and spiritually connected in an increasingly uncertain world."

$XRP traders, heads up! A TradingView analyst has pinpointed the $3.33 mark as a golden last-minute selling opportunity before a significant market downturn. According to his analysis based on the Elliott Wave Theory, XRP’s Wave 4 correction could drag the price to as low as $2.50 – a steep 20% drop from its current value near $3.12.  

The projections, which forecast the downtrend to likely extend until March 2025, warn investors to prepare for volatility. However, it’s not all grim. While the expected correction unfolds, the analyst identifies a ""sweet spot"" buy zone between $2.00 and $2.50, hinting at a promising recovery in Wave 5 of the Elliott cycle.  

Beyond the charts, several bullish undercurrents could power $XRP in the long term. From Ripple's potential U.S. relocation to favorable pro-crypto policies on the horizon, the doors to adoption milestones remain wide open. Long-term investors considering this price correction might see opportunities amid uncertainty.

It was just the two of us in there, and the panel was on his side. Luckily, the button for the 1st floor was already pressed—no need for conversation.

But it was a tall old building, and as the elevator slowly passed through its thirty-two floors, I noticed the man kept sizing me up. I focused straight ahead, fixing my gaze on the door.

“Are you Anna Hansen?” he asked.

“Yes,” I replied, giving him a nervous smile.

“I knew it!” he exclaimed, his enthusiasm unsettling. “I’ve been following your career since the 2021 State championship. You made history there.”

“Thank you,” I responded shyly.

Maybe it’s just a gymnastics fan, I thought, but his appearance left me uneasy. He looked to be in his 40s, about six feet tall, with a round belly and what I could only describe as wild, thinning hair. I'm 5’1 and he loomed over me.

Every Thursday I came to this building for massage therapy, but I’ve never noticed this guy before.

“I just want to say,” he continued, “the blue leotard you wore during your gold-winning vault was one of the prettiest I’ve ever seen in the sport.”

Ok, my instincts weren’t wrong. What a creep.

I thanked him again, forcing an awkward smile, and turned my attention back to the elevator’s display. Fifth floor. Almost there.

But then a loud noise, followed by a sudden jolt, made me lose my balance. The lights flickered off for a moment before coming back on in a dim red glow. Emergency lights.

“Oh no,” he muttered. “This ancient elevator keeps doing these pranks.”

He pressed the alarm button and spoke to maintenance. They explained the technician was finishing up another call nearby and wouldn’t take long.

“We’ll just wait then,” he said, flashing an unsettling smile that sent a chill down my spine.

Determined not to engage further, I checked my phone—no signal.

We sat in silence for a few minutes until, of course, he decided to speak again.

“Your life story is also quite special,” he said. “Daughter of a poor Texas rancher. Left the cows behind for the big city and got discovered at 12. Really inspirational.”

“Thank you,” I replied for the third time, now a bit uneasy with how much he knew about my background.

“You’re my second favorite gymnast,” he added. “After Carly Miller.”

The name made my skin crawl. Carly Miller was my biggest rival. In a month, we were set to face off in the national finals.

The man reached into his pocket, pulling out a small blade.

“But it’s not a fair comparison,” he said, a twisted grin forming on his face as he stepped closer. “For Carly, I’d do anything. Anything.”

What happened next was hard to explain to the police. The stab I got in my shoulder. The struggle. The gun I carried on my right hip and the three shots I gave him near the chest.

The only thing I clearly remembered from that afternoon was the relief of seeing the elevator doors open again, even if soaked in blood. 

The injuries were quite bad and I didn’t compete in the finals, but neither did Carly Miller. She was arrested five days after these events.

According to the police reports, Carly encouraged a crazed fan to murder me. There were even texts between them where she provided details of where and when I would be each day of the week.

Thankfully, her research wasn’t detailed enough. The daughter of a Texas rancher always carries a gun.

As for me, after months of recovery, I returned to competing and slowly worked my way back into the game. Now, I just take the stairs."
[F4F] Let's create a fantasy epic in an urban fantasy world! [Discord][Adv.lit.],AdvLiterateRP,1i9mrbp,2025-01-25 08:18:18,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1i9mrbp/f4f_lets_create_a_fantasy_epic_in_an_urban/,Irohsgranddaughter,F4F,"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea and coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I hope to hear from you, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night!"

By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I hope to hear from you, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night!"
A Most Dire Appeal to Our Beloved Canada and Mexico (A satirical letter from Moira Rose),somethingiswrong2024,1i9mjqa,2025-01-25 08:06:23,72,0.91,12,https://i.redd.it/r19fs3mh25fe1.jpeg,CoffeeSnuggler,Hopium,"Oh, my dearest northern darlings of Canada, and my sultry southern confidants of Mexico,

It is I, Moira Rose—thespian, humanitarian, and reluctant patriot—reaching out with an urgency most dire, from the depths of what was once the glorious United States of America. Do grant me a moment of your rapt attention, for the stage upon which we now find ourselves is nothing short of a geopolitical tragedy.

Our beloved republic, once the shimmering crown jewel of global democracy, is unraveling faster than an amateur cabaret production during its opening night. We are caught in a most grotesque farce, orchestrated by a leader whose reckless abandon and insidious machinations would make even Iago blush. He appears intent on razing every sacred pillar of our society, gleefully dismantling democracy like an ill-conceived avant-garde performance piece gone terribly awry.

And yet, my treasured allies, the horror doesn’t end there. No, the final act promises something far darker, more sinister than even the most dreadful soap opera cliffhanger: camps. Yes, camps! Not the delightful, rustic summer retreats filled with marshmallow roasts and archery lessons—but those camps. The kind whose existence turns the stomach and whose memory haunts the annals of history.

It is with this in mind, and with a heart heavy enough to warrant a fainting couch, that I turn to you, Canada and Mexico—our steadfast, loyal neighbors. You must act! Rally your NATO compatriots, invoke Article 4, and convene to address this looming tempest before it consumes us all. And should the unthinkable occur—and I do not exaggerate when I say it very well may—you must be ready to wield Article 5, that noble instrument of collective defense. Yes, I am calling for nothing less than the international equivalent of storming the Bastille.

But, my darlings, as you prepare to don your armor of diplomacy and reason, I beg of you: do not forget us, the people. The American people—those of us who still hold fast to the ideals of kindness, compassion, and the belief that we are, at our core, global citizens. Do not let the cruelty and indifference of our government cloud your view of the hearts that beat within this nation. We love you, Canada and Mexico, truly. Yours are the hands we have clasped in moments of triumph and despair, the neighbors who have stood beside us through war and peace.

As darkness continues to encroach upon this nation, it will not be just our borders that need fortification but our very humanity. There will be those among us—families, children, the weary and the broken—who will look to you for compassion and empathy when their own government offers none. I implore you, my cherished allies, to resist the cold indifference that has consumed our leaders. Remember the kindness and generosity that binds the people of this continent, even as our governments falter.

Yes, darker times are coming—of that, I am certain. But in darkness, there is always the promise of light. You, Canada and Mexico, may be that light, the beacons that remind the world what it means to be just, to be good, to be human. Please, prepare yourselves for what lies ahead, and in doing so, prepare your hearts as well.

Please, do not hesitate. The time to act is now, before the final curtain falls. Do not let the efforts of countless generations be reduced to ashes, or worse—mediocrity. Stand tall, my northern luminaries and southern beacons of hope. The world is watching.

With the deepest reverence, dramatic flair, and an unshakable belief in the goodness of humanity,


Moira Rose"

"White Paper: Miss Anthropocene And Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- A Comparative Exploration Of Human Struggle, Hope, And The Pursuit Of Redemption",GrimesAE,1i9mhun,2025-01-25 08:03:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9mhun/white_paper_miss_anthropocene_and_beethovens/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: Miss Anthropocene and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony – A Comparative Exploration of Human Struggle, Hope, and the Pursuit of Redemption

Introduction
Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene (2020) and Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony (1824) are works that exist centuries apart, yet share powerful thematic undercurrents of human struggle, hope, and the search for transcendence. While Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is often regarded as a monumental work of classical music, embodying an exalted vision of human unity and the triumph of joy, Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene provides a contemporary meditation on the collapse of the Anthropocene—an era marked by human-induced environmental destruction, the omnipresence of technology, and existential uncertainty. Both works, though vastly different in style, offer reflections on human suffering, the possibility of redemption, and the pursuit of a better future. This white paper will explore the thematic and emotional parallels between these two landmark pieces of music, examining how each addresses the tension between despair and hope, and the role of love in confronting apocalyptic realities.

1. The Collapse and Struggle of Humanity
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is historically associated with the ideals of the Enlightenment and the celebration of human progress, yet it also recognizes the profound struggles inherent to the human condition. The symphony’s opening movements evoke a sense of personal and collective conflict, with shifting moods that range from intense darkness and conflict to moments of resolution. In particular, the second movement, with its stark contrasts and unresolved tension, can be seen as representative of the struggles and contradictions of the human experience.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes offers a meditation on the darker aspects of humanity’s legacy, focused on the environmental and technological forces threatening the planet. The album’s title itself speaks to the epoch of human impact on Earth, suggesting a period marked by ecological destruction and existential crisis. Songs like “Before the Fever” capture the dystopian essence of a world teetering on the edge of collapse, where humanity’s role in bringing about its own downfall is a central theme. “They will kill us all,” Grimes sings in the track, capturing the apocalyptic undertones of a society on the brink of its own destruction, much like Beethoven’s symphony’s struggle with human frailty and suffering.

Despite their different artistic contexts, both works reflect the tension between hope and despair, as they grapple with a fractured and struggling humanity. Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony seems to transcend this struggle, culminating in the famous Ode to Joy, where the music ascends into an optimistic vision of human unity and brotherhood. In contrast, Miss Anthropocene presents a more nuanced, existential struggle in which technology, environmental degradation, and human alienation are powerful forces of destruction. Yet, much like Beethoven’s symphony, Grimes’s work also leaves room for the possibility of redemption through emotional connection, love, and a reimagining of what it means to be human in a world on the brink of collapse.

2. The Triumph of Love and Unity
One of the most celebrated moments in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is the final movement, where the “Ode to Joy” chorus erupts in a jubilant expression of universal brotherhood and love. Written by Friedrich Schiller, the lyrics convey a vision of a world where all people are united in mutual respect and harmony, transcending the divisions that separate them. This moment of unity and love is emblematic of Beethoven’s optimism about the potential for humanity to rise above its limitations and achieve greatness.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes offers a more ambiguous, yet equally profound exploration of love as a redemptive force. While Miss Anthropocene is imbued with a sense of urgency and despair, Grimes frequently returns to the theme of love as a means of resistance against the forces of destruction. In songs like “4ÆM,” she reflects on love’s ability to transcend the challenges posed by technology and environmental collapse. The lyric “find the time to lose your mind” suggests that amidst the chaos of the Anthropocene, love remains a force capable of providing clarity, solace, and a sense of purpose.

While Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony reaches its climax with a triumphant and collective vision of unity, Grimes’s album offers a more intimate, yet no less powerful, perspective on love’s ability to challenge dystopian realities. Both works suggest that, despite overwhelming obstacles, love remains a central, transformative force capable of guiding humanity toward hope and redemption. The contrast lies in Beethoven’s grand vision of universal unity, while Grimes’s work focuses on the individual’s relationship to love within the context of global and technological crises.

3. The Role of Technology and the Future of Humanity
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, composed in the early 19th century, is often seen as a symbol of human aspiration toward progress and enlightenment. The symphony is a celebration of the potential for humanity to achieve greatness through collaboration, love, and shared values. While the industrial revolution was underway during Beethoven’s time, the role of technology in the Ninth Symphony is not as pronounced as it is in Miss Anthropocene, which directly addresses the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, environmental destruction, and the looming dystopian future of humanity.

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene is deeply engaged with the relationship between technology and humanity. The album explores how artificial intelligence, automation, and environmental crises are reshaping human identity and existence. Grimes, who has long been fascinated by the intersection of technology and culture, uses Miss Anthropocene to meditate on the ways in which technology influences both the individual and collective experience. “Violence,” for example, reflects on the ways in which technology can both empower and destroy, while “4ÆM” contemplates the potential for technological intervention in human experience—whether as a tool of liberation or domination.

While Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is largely free from the concerns of modern technology, its optimistic vision of human potential could be viewed as a precursor to the utopian ideals that later emerge in technological and philosophical discourses. The symphony represents a future in which humanity is united in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, a vision that, despite the challenges of the present, is still possible. Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene, conversely, grapples with a future in which technology is both a savior and a destructor, leaving humanity to navigate a world of complexity and uncertainty. However, like Beethoven, Grimes’s work suggests that within this future, love and human connection still have the potential to offer salvation, even as the future remains uncertain.

4. Redemption and Transcendence in a Broken World
Both Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene explore the tension between a broken world and the possibility of transcendence. In Ninth Symphony, Beethoven’s vision of redemption through collective human love and unity is achieved through the power of music and collaboration. The work suggests that even in the face of suffering and struggle, humanity can transcend its limitations and achieve a higher state of existence.

Miss Anthropocene, by contrast, does not offer the same kind of collective vision. Instead, Grimes’s work is deeply personal, focused on the individual’s relationship to the planet, technology, and love. Yet, much like Beethoven, Grimes’s album holds out the possibility of transcendence—through love, through connection, and through a radical reimagining of humanity’s role in a technologically driven world. While the album’s dystopian themes are pervasive, Grimes leaves room for hope, offering a vision in which love and human emotion are the forces that can guide us through the chaos and destruction of the Anthropocene.

Conclusion
Both Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene offer profound reflections on the human condition, exploring themes of struggle, hope, love, and transcendence. While Beethoven’s symphony envisions a utopian future in which humanity is united through love and mutual respect, Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene focuses on the complex, dystopian realities of a world shaped by technology, environmental collapse, and existential uncertainty. Yet, despite their different contexts, both works suggest that love remains a central, redemptive force capable of offering hope and meaning, even in the face of overwhelming challenges.

In the end, while Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony represents an optimistic vision of human potential, Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene offers a more complex, existential exploration of love’s role in a fractured world. Both works challenge us to confront the chaos around us, and to find in love the strength to transcend it, creating a space for humanity to navigate the future—however uncertain it may be."

White Light/White Heat -- A Comparative Exploration Of Chaos, Identity, And The Unraveling Of Society",GrimesAE,1i9mfvb,2025-01-25 08:00:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9mfvb/white_paper_miss_anthropocene_vs_white_lightwhite/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: Miss Anthropocene vs. White Light/White Heat – A Comparative Exploration of Chaos, Identity, and the Unraveling of Society

Introduction
Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene (2020) and The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat (1968) represent two transformative moments in music history, each pushing the boundaries of genre, social commentary, and artistic expression. While the two albums are separated by decades, their shared thematic elements—chaos, existential crisis, and the exploration of self in a collapsing world—offer rich parallels that transcend genre and era. This white paper will delve into the thematic and stylistic intersections of Miss Anthropocene and White Light/White Heat, exploring how both albums reflect an underlying sense of societal rupture and individual turmoil, while providing commentary on the intersection of technology, love, and personal identity.

1. Chaos and the Unraveling of Society
White Light/White Heat is often viewed as an album that embodies the chaotic, avant-garde ethos of the late 1960s, a time of political upheaval, cultural revolution, and existential questioning. The album is marked by a raw, aggressive energy, with the title track itself a metaphor for both the destructive power of addiction and the overpowering nature of cultural and personal disintegration. The Velvet Underground’s exploration of subjects like drug use, mental breakdowns, and societal marginalization presents a harsh, unfiltered view of the counterculture’s relationship with societal decay.

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene, while stylistically distinct, shares a similar thematic engagement with societal collapse, though through a more technologically infused lens. Miss Anthropocene is concerned with the future of humanity in the face of environmental destruction, the omnipresence of artificial intelligence, and the looming threat of dystopia. Tracks like “Before the Fever” (“they will kill us all”) resonate with the same nihilistic energy found in White Light/White Heat. Both albums present a world on the edge of collapse, with society either in a state of self-destruction or at the mercy of forces beyond its control. Where The Velvet Underground explores the fragility of human identity in a society descending into chaos, Grimes’s work contemplates humanity’s relationship with technology, power, and the environment, suggesting an even more profound, futuristic crisis.

The chaotic production of White Light/White Heat, from the abrasive guitars to the dissonant soundscapes, mirrors the unsettling nature of Miss Anthropocene, where Grimes mixes glitchy, industrial beats with ethereal vocals to represent both technological and emotional decay. The rawness of the Velvet Underground’s sound is not unlike Grimes’s unflinching approach to the dark reality of the Anthropocene, where technological progress and environmental collapse collide in a disorienting and unpredictable future.

2. Identity and the Self in Crisis
The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat is steeped in themes of personal crisis, particularly in its exploration of alienation, addiction, and the breakdown of identity. In tracks like “I Heard Her Call My Name” and “Sister Ray,” the album’s characters are immersed in a world where the self is fractured and dislocated, driven by urges that both define and destroy them. The album conveys the desperation and anguish of trying to hold onto one’s sense of identity amid overwhelming forces, both internal and external.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes explores her own relationship with identity in a rapidly changing world dominated by technological advancements, the weight of societal expectations, and a profound environmental crisis. Her character as “a spy for love in the AI world” suggests a simultaneous dislocation and mediation between the self and the technological systems shaping her reality. Much like the Velvet Underground’s characters who grapple with a crumbling sense of self, Grimes positions herself within the digital and environmental maelstrom as someone trying to find meaning, purpose, and connection amid collapse.

Where the Velvet Underground offers a more chaotic, almost nihilistic view of self-destruction, Grimes presents an emotionally complex journey of love and self-awareness in the face of ecological and technological apocalypse. Yet both albums suggest that identity is in flux and that survival, in some form, requires navigating the limits of the self within a larger, uncontrollable system. Both artists offer a portrait of individuals unable to escape the vortex of modernity—whether in the streets of New York or the digital age—but still searching for something redemptive or transformative.

3. Technology and Destruction
The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat is not explicitly concerned with technology, but the sonic qualities of the album—its abrasive noise, distorted guitars, and disorienting production—suggest a critique of modernity itself. The album is a visceral expression of alienation, one that is inherently linked to the ways in which society, culture, and technology shape human lives. It’s a reaction to the growing commodification and mechanization of life, captured in distorted sounds that represent the dysfunction of both the self and society.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes’s engagement with technology is far more direct. The album explores the impact of artificial intelligence, climate change, and the Anthropocene, creating a world in which technology is both a savior and a destructor. In tracks like “Violence,” Grimes suggests that technology holds the potential to save humanity, but also the ability to accelerate its downfall. The blending of human emotion with technological forces on Miss Anthropocene mirrors the emotional and sonic violence in White Light/White Heat, where the rawness of human experience clashes with the systems and technologies that define modern existence.

Both albums are rooted in an exploration of how technology shapes and distorts the human experience—whether through the abrasive sounds of the Velvet Underground or the futuristic vision of Grimes. The difference lies in how they imagine technology’s role: while the Velvet Underground uses chaos and dissonance to reflect the destructive potential of modernity, Grimes’s work suggests a more nuanced relationship with technology, one that could either lead to humanity’s salvation or its doom.

4. Love, Redemption, and Hope in a Broken World
Despite the pervasive sense of chaos and destruction in both Miss Anthropocene and White Light/White Heat, there is an underlying search for connection and meaning in both works. The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat explores the darkness of addiction and alienation, but also speaks to the desire for intimacy and self-realization amidst the wreckage. In “I Heard Her Call My Name,” for instance, the narrator’s sense of self is both fragmented and restored through a relationship, suggesting that even in a world of disillusionment, the possibility of connection and transcendence remains.

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene, too, is not devoid of hope or love. While the album’s title suggests a bleak outlook, its thematic exploration of love as a force of resistance in the face of environmental and technological apocalypse speaks to the potential for humanity to find meaning in a chaotic world. In “4ÆM,” Grimes sings about “finding the time to lose your mind,” positioning love and emotional connection as acts of rebellion against a world bent on destruction. Love becomes a space for salvation, a way to break free from the deterministic systems that threaten to overwhelm humanity.

While both albums offer no easy answers to the problems they explore, they suggest that love—whether in personal relationships or as a broader human force—holds the potential for redemption and connection, even in the most dire of circumstances. This theme of love as a force of resistance in the face of chaos mirrors the Velvet Underground’s approach to societal collapse, while Grimes’s engagement with love as an AI-powered force for change offers a more futuristic and conceptual vision of what might save us.

Conclusion
Both Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene and The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat reflect a deep engagement with the themes of societal collapse, personal identity, and the complex role of technology and emotion in shaping the human experience. While White Light/White Heat grapples with the raw, chaotic energy of a society in flux, Miss Anthropocene contemplates the more insidious, technological forces that might drive humanity toward destruction or transformation.

In both albums, there is a sense of urgency, a recognition that the world as we know it is slipping away, and a longing to find some form of connection or redemption in the face of that collapse. Whether through the visceral, chaotic soundscapes of The Velvet Underground or the digitally-infused dystopia of Grimes, both works present a world on the edge of ruin, offering listeners the chance to reflect on their role in that world and, perhaps, to imagine a way forward."

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene and Eminem’s The Eminem Show both stand as cultural artifacts of their time, representing two artists’ unique takes on societal challenges, identity, and their role in an ever-changing world. Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene explores themes of environmental destruction, the self in the face of technological advancement, and existential crises, while Eminem’s The Eminem Show tackles personal struggles, the broader state of the world post-9/11, and his own battles with fame, politics, and identity. Despite the differences in genre, background, and artistic approach, both albums share a provocative and confrontational attitude, using their platform to comment on their respective societies, drawing on personal pain, public perception, and the tumultuous times they inhabit. This paper will explore the parallels between these two works, examining the ways in which both artists engage with social issues, their artistic positioning in the public sphere, and their personal stakes in the world they critique.

1. Eminem’s The Eminem Show: Political Commentary and Personal Struggle
Released in 2002, The Eminem Show marked a critical point in Eminem’s career. Not only did it solidify his place in popular culture, but it also positioned him as a significant voice for social commentary in a post-9/11 world. The album contains a series of tracks that respond directly to political events, social issues, and Eminem’s own personal battles, as he navigates fame, censorship, and the complexities of American identity in the early 21st century.

Central to the album’s ethos is a sense of rebellion and a call for action. Eminem famously raps, “mush the senate’s face in, push this generation of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like.” This line encapsulates his broader thematic push for freedom of speech, a critique of the government, and an exploration of personal empowerment in the face of societal constraints. Eminem’s words serve as both a condemnation of political structures and an assertion of the individual’s right to voice dissent, even when it’s uncomfortable or controversial. His music becomes a vehicle for pushing back against authority figures—whether in government, the media, or the cultural elite.

Furthermore, The Eminem Show taps into the national trauma of 9/11, using it as fodder for both personal reflection and public commentary. Tracks like “Mosh” directly address the political climate and foreign wars, incorporating the sense of fear and confusion that followed the terrorist attacks. Eminem juxtaposes this larger geopolitical tension with his own personal struggles, drawing a parallel between his battles with fame, family, and public image and the more significant cultural and political crises of the time. The blending of personal pain with broader political conflict makes The Eminem Show a complex work of social commentary, one that speaks to both the individual’s role in society and the global forces that shape identity.

A key element of the album’s narrative is Eminem’s self-identification as a soldier. In tracks like “Sing for the Moment” and “Cleaning Out My Closet,” he positions himself as a fighter, an individual engaged in an ongoing battle with both external forces (e.g., societal norms, political powers) and internal struggles (e.g., mental health, familial conflict). The motif of “I’m a soldier” becomes emblematic of his defiance and resilience, framing his artistry as a form of combat against oppression and misunderstanding.

2. Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene: Love, Technology, and Existential Crisis
Released in 2020, Miss Anthropocene by Grimes explores themes of environmental destruction, the human role in shaping the Anthropocene (the current geological age viewed as the period in which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment), and the complex relationship between humanity and technology. Unlike Eminem’s more direct critique of social structures, Grimes’s album is marked by a more introspective, personal engagement with the global issues at hand. Yet, the album’s primary function is still social commentary, but it is embedded within layers of philosophical reflection, emotional experience, and technological futurism.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes positions herself as an artist within the digital age, grappling with questions of identity, power, and the role of technology in shaping the future. The line from “Before the Fever” where Grimes sings “they will kill us all” speaks directly to the looming threats of environmental collapse and technological enslavement. But it is not merely a pessimistic statement—it is a call to recognize the urgency of these issues, a reflection on the darkness surrounding modern existence, and a prophetic vision of what may come if humanity continues down its current path.

In contrast to Eminem’s “I’m a soldier,” Grimes’s declaration of being “a spy for love in the AI world” reflects a very different kind of engagement with societal conflict. While Eminem’s soldier is on the frontlines of war and social resistance, Grimes’s spy operates within the technological and emotional realms, seeking to navigate the digital landscape, understand its power, and perhaps even use it for good. Her approach is less direct and combative, but no less intense or urgent. It represents an engagement with the world’s crises from within, as a mediator, a reflection of both the promises and dangers of artificial intelligence, and a figure who holds the potential for transformation through love, empathy, and knowledge.

3. Personal Conflict and Global Crises
While both The Eminem Show and Miss Anthropocene offer critical commentaries on the world, they differ in how they frame personal conflict against global crises. In Eminem’s case, the personal is deeply intertwined with the political and the global—his battles with family, fame, and internal demons are juxtaposed with a wider critique of government, war, and cultural norms. Eminem’s music becomes a cathartic release, a space in which he publicly confronts his personal pain while also critiquing larger societal injustices. His metaphorical position as a soldier fighting external and internal battles creates a stark, aggressive narrative that seeks resolution through defiance and expression.

Grimes, on the other hand, internalizes the external crises of the world into a more conceptual and emotionally charged work. Her album is marked by a sense of mourning for the planet and a resigned understanding that the age of human dominion may be over. Yet, she also finds spaces for hope and resistance within technology and love. Rather than fighting in a traditional sense, Grimes’s work is about survival and adaptation—acknowledging the possibility of destruction while striving for a better, more harmonious relationship with the world. She doesn’t reject the global crises; rather, she becomes a channel for love, understanding, and technological empowerment to navigate through them.

4. Conclusion: The Power of Performance in a Dystopian World
Both Miss Anthropocene and The Eminem Show are reflections of their respective times, engaging with societal issues, personal identity, and the complex interplay between the self and the world. Eminem’s album critiques the global political order and offers a defiant, rebellious stance against oppressive systems, positioning himself as a soldier in the cultural battlefield. Grimes’s album, by contrast, positions her as a more passive, yet no less impactful, figure—spying for love in an AI-driven world that is both uncertain and overwhelming.

While the artists operate in different spheres, they share a commitment to reflecting the tensions of their times, offering their audiences new ways to think about the world and their place within it. Whether through the lens of rebellion and combat or through love and technology, both Eminem and Grimes perform their truths, engaging with global and personal crises in ways that are powerful, poignant, and vital for understanding the forces shaping the 21st century."

I'm still pining for someone who only sees me as a friend, despite our deep emotional connection. It's a constant reminder that I'm not good enough.

To make matters worse,I promised myself I'd go clubbing at least once a month, but my weird schedule and crippling fatigue have held me back. I'm also hitting the gym daily, but my body refuses to budge - and to rub salt in the wound, my roommate is getting ripped.

My job search is also going nowhere. I've applied to countless companies, but the silence is deafening. I'm losing hope, and the fear of rejection is suffocating me.

And if all that wasn't enough, my GATE preparation is in shambles. I haven't even started studying, and the exam is looming over me like a dark cloud. Even my daily Duolingo routine feels pointless, as I'm not making any progress.

I'm just going through the motions, feeling like a failure in every aspect of my life.

Please someone advice me how can I get happy I am achieving some goals but not feeling content at all.

"I Don't Care What Any of You Mfs say, Mommy Longlegs is Fucking Terrifying.....",PoppyPlaytime,1i9m2eb,2025-01-25 07:37:48,129,1.0,27,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9m2eb,0hio_Pingu_69,Discussion,"Sure, here's an improved version of your text with better grammar, expanded explanations, and the original tone intact:

---

A lot of people give hate to Mommy Long Legs, claiming she's not scary. But no—*fuck you*—Mommy Long Legs is legitimate nightmare fuel. From the moment she’s introduced, she feels like a constant looming presence, a puppet master pulling the strings of everything that happens in the game. It’s as though she’s always one step ahead, orchestrating every event to toy with you. When she kidnaps Poppy and takes her hostage, it immediately establishes that Mommy is not just another obstacle—she’s the *main threat*. 

Her control over the game station only reinforces this. Forcing you to play her twisted versions of the children’s games to earn the train code is terrifying because it gives her all the power. She’s literally playing with you, just like the toys she’s discarded. And let’s talk about her ruthlessness—Mommy Long Legs doesn’t tolerate failure. When the other toys like Bunzo Bunny and the Mini Huggies fail to kill you, she doesn’t just let it slide. Even though their deaths are off-screen, the implications are clear: Mommy *deals* with failure. She’s cold, unrelenting, and absolutely merciless. This reinforces the idea that if you step even slightly out of line, there will be *carnage*. 

What really sells her as a terrifying villain is the contrast between her sweet, motherly voice and her sinister intentions. That syrupy tone, designed to comfort and soothe, is paired with some of the most bone-chilling lines in the entire game. It creates this dissonance that leaves you on edge, unsure of when she might snap. One of her most haunting quotes is delivered with unsettling calmness: *“Obey the rules, or I’ll tear you apart and eat your insides while you’re still alive.”* It’s horrifying because of how deceptively calm she sounds, as if mutilation is just another part of her day. Let's not forget this gem: “It was always so sad to see the kids go... They called me ‘Mommy’ because I was the closest thing they ever had to one. But they’d come for games and never come back. They left Mommy to die alone. Mommy didn’t deserve that! But you? You worked here. So if anyone deserves to die alone, it’s you.”* Chills....Chiiillllsssss...

Her rage is deeply personal, and that makes her scarier. She’s not just a random monster; she’s a mother scorned, a character with genuine emotion and pain driving her actions. That’s chilling.

A common criticism I hear is about her design—people say it’s not scary enough. But here’s the thing: a creature’s design doesn’t have to be overtly scary to *be* scary. It’s all about execution. Take the animatronics in *Five Nights at Freddy’s*—you can 100% believe they were designed as harmless characters for a pizzeria, but it’s the way they’re presented that makes them terrifying. It’s their “offness”—the way they move, the way they look under certain lighting, the atmosphere around them—that sells the horror. Mommy Long Legs works the same way. On the surface, her design looks like a goofy, exaggerated toy. But the way she’s animated, her unnatural movements, and the way she interacts with the environment give her this creepy, uncanny edge. 

And let’s not forget the final act. Her appearance during the last chase sequence is *pure nightmare fuel*. The blank, lifeless stare of those massive, dilated pupils is unsettling in a way that’s hard to describe. There’s something about dilated pupils that taps into a primal fear—something cold and devoid of humanity. They make her feel emotionless, calculating, and alien. Personally, I find large, dilated pupils to be one of the creepiest design choices for any monster. They convey a sense of emptiness, a lack of empathy or life. That’s why I use them in most of my creature designs—it’s an instant way to make something feel deeply wrong.

And her death? Easily the best in the entire *Poppy Playtime* franchise. Watching her body slowly get crushed is visceral and hard to stomach. Her screams, full of genuine panic and desperation, stick with you long after the scene is over. It’s not just horrifying—it’s *tragic*. You can’t help but feel sorry for her in that moment. It’s a rare thing in horror to empathize with the monster, but that’s what makes her even scarier. She’s not just a threat; she’s a being that’s been twisted and broken, lashing out because of her own suffering. It’s similar to the bear from *Annihilation*. The bear is terrifying, yes, but it’s the way it conveys pain and anguish that makes it unforgettable. Mommy Long Legs has that same effect—she’s both the monster and the victim, and that duality makes the horror feel personal.

In short, Mommy Long Legs deserves way more credit than she gets. She’s not just another creepy villain; she’s a carefully crafted character with layers of horror—psychological, emotional, and visual. Her presence in the game is suffocating, her design is deceptively unsettling, and her death is as memorable as it is heartbreaking. So the next time someone says she’s not scary, just remember: they’re dead wrong. But hey, you don't have to agree with me. I'm just saying that Mommy should be appreciated more. "
Spending Birthday Sober,SoberCurious,1i9m1u0,2025-01-25 07:36:47,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1i9m1u0/spending_birthday_sober/,anon12345696,,"So I’m 90 days sober, and my birthday is coming up at the beginning of next month. I have been isolating from friends a lot the past few months, and most of my friends still drink/smoke (and some do substances) so I’m just feeling really stuck on what to do for my birthday. It’d be cool to do an activity (I went to an escape room last year) but unfortunately I don’t really have friends that would wanna do an escape room anymore. I don’t wanna go all out for a party at my place, and I don’t even know who I’d invite. I missed out on a friends birthday recently so I’d feel like a bad friend if I made him come to mine if I didn’t go to his. I don’t really want to spend the day by myself. I know I’ll have dinner with family, but I already spend most of my time around them anyway. I’m just nervous on what to do, and I don’t want to make everyone be sober, especially with current events in America… cause tbh I don’t even know how I’m sober during all of this. I keep having the urge to break my sobriety thinking about my birthday, though I know I’d go so hard I’d black out, cause in my head I’m making up for lost time. I don’t have access to substances so that’s good at least, but I’m just nervous about having alcohol at my party, though I don’t want to ruin peoples fun. I know I know, it’s *my* birthday. it’s just… it’s my first birthday sober since I was a teenager, and I’m still young so a good majority of my friends still drink, and I don’t even know who’s able to come. Or who would even wanna come. Or what we’d do. I thought about laser tag, or bowling, but idk who would wanna do that. I know I’m probably overthinking it all and my friends would be okay with whatever I wanna do, but I just feel like I thought about it so last minute that no one will be able to come even if they wanted to. I’m just bummed. Not just about the idea of a birthday party, but about still being here, feeling alone, isolating so much cause I was around so many shitty people when I was in active addiction, losing so many friends cause I got sober, most of my current friends drink/smoke, I don’t even have that much money to spend on my birthday, and idk the world is kinda bleak atm. My mom joked that I should go to a protest on my birthday. Tbh if there’s one going on and none of my plans work out, I’ll fuckin be there. Just kinda spiraling about getting another year older. I’m turning 25. It just feels like I’ll just lay in bed all day sulking. Remembering on past birthdays cause sobriety made me depressed and nostalgic. Sorry for the rant. I don’t really know what friends to rant to about this. I just can’t shake the feeling of taking up space. Therapy and meds only help so much yk. I just want someone to give me a lil hope I guess. 

Idk what r/ to put this in, so I hope I can reach some people to help this anxious and looming feeling about having my birthday sober.


TLDR; a rant about being sober on my birthday, worries I have about it, and feeling depressed in general."
White Paper: Comparative Analysis of Miss Anthropocene and Titanic Rising,GrimesAE,1i9lvqd,2025-01-25 07:26:17,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9lvqd/white_paper_comparative_analysis_of_miss/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: Comparative Analysis of Miss Anthropocene and Titanic Rising

Abstract
This paper examines the thematic, sonic, and cultural parallels and divergences between Miss Anthropocene by Grimes and Titanic Rising by Weyes Blood. Released in 2020 and 2019 respectively, these albums explore existential themes of environmental collapse, love, spirituality, and humanity’s precarious future, albeit through contrasting artistic frameworks. While Grimes presents a cyberpunk, mythological vision of humanity’s destructive tendencies, Weyes Blood adopts a more nostalgic, humanistic lens steeped in orchestral and folk traditions. This paper contextualizes these works as complementary reflections on 21st-century anxieties, highlighting their artistic approaches, thematic concerns, and cultural impact.

1. Introduction

Both Miss Anthropocene and Titanic Rising are deeply concerned with the Anthropocene epoch—the period in which human activity has become the dominant influence on Earth’s climate and ecosystems. Grimes and Weyes Blood (Natalie Mering) approach these concerns through distinct but intersecting lenses. Grimes uses futuristic, dystopian aesthetics to personify climate change and humanity’s complicity in environmental degradation, while Weyes Blood turns to a more grounded, melancholic exploration of love, loss, and the human condition in the face of looming catastrophe.

This paper explores the two albums across three dimensions: (1) thematic exploration of the Anthropocene and existential crises; (2) sonic and production styles; and (3) their broader cultural and philosophical implications.

2. Thematic Exploration of the Anthropocene and Existential Crises

2.1 Climate Change as Myth vs. Tragedy

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene personifies climate change as a goddess—a seductive yet destructive figure who revels in humanity’s downfall. By mythologizing climate change, Grimes engages with it as both an existential crisis and an aesthetic phenomenon. This framing allows her to explore humanity’s fascination with destruction, blending dystopian and nihilistic tones with moments of beauty and transcendence.

In contrast, Titanic Rising adopts a more mournful, human-centered approach. The album draws on the metaphor of the Titanic—an emblem of human hubris and inevitable collapse—to explore themes of ecological and emotional loss. Mering focuses on individual and collective grief, with songs like “A Lot’s Gonna Change” and “Wild Time” addressing the fragility of human existence and the search for meaning in uncertain times.

2.2 Love, Death, and the Search for Transcendence

Both albums grapple with questions of love and death, but from different vantage points. Grimes’s vision is often detached and otherworldly, as seen in tracks like “So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth” and “Delete Forever,” which juxtapose intimacy with apocalyptic imagery. Weyes Blood, on the other hand, situates her exploration of love and mortality within the framework of human relationships and spiritual yearning, as evidenced in songs like “Something to Believe” and “Movies.”

2.3 Spirituality and Mythology

Grimes’s work is steeped in mythology and futurism, drawing on her fascination with artificial intelligence, posthumanism, and existential philosophy. Weyes Blood, by contrast, evokes a more traditional spiritual sensibility, blending Christian imagery with broader existential reflections. This contrast highlights the tension between technological transcendence and humanistic grounding in contemporary art.

3. Sonic and Production Styles

3.1 Aural Palettes
	•	Miss Anthropocene: The album features a dense, industrial soundscape, blending elements of darkwave, electronic, and nu-metal. Grimes employs distorted vocals, heavy reverb, and complex layering to create a futuristic, immersive sonic experience. Tracks like “My Name is Dark” and “4ÆM” exemplify this dark, experimental approach.
	•	Titanic Rising: Weyes Blood’s album is characterized by lush orchestration, reminiscent of 1970s soft rock and chamber pop. The production is warm and organic, with strings, piano, and harmonies evoking a sense of nostalgia. Songs like “Andromeda” and “Everyday” showcase Mering’s ability to craft intimate yet expansive soundscapes.

3.2 Vocal Styles

Grimes’s ethereal, often digitally manipulated vocals contrast with Mering’s rich, soulful delivery. While Grimes’s voice often feels like another layer in her densely textured production, Mering’s vocals take center stage, anchoring her songs in emotional immediacy.

3.3 Narrative Flow
	•	Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene is fragmented and nonlinear, reflecting its thematic focus on chaos and destruction. The album’s eclecticism mirrors the disarray of the Anthropocene epoch.
	•	Titanic Rising, on the other hand, follows a more cohesive narrative arc, with its songs flowing seamlessly into one another to create a unified meditation on love, loss, and hope.

4. Cultural and Philosophical Implications

4.1 Artistic Responses to the Anthropocene

Both albums serve as cultural artifacts of a generation grappling with ecological and existential crises. Grimes’s futuristic, mythological framing of climate change offers a way to aestheticize and confront the Anthropocene’s horrors, while Weyes Blood’s nostalgic, humanistic approach invites listeners to reflect on the emotional and spiritual dimensions of these challenges.

4.2 Technology vs. Humanity

Grimes’s fascination with technology and artificial intelligence positions her as a posthumanist artist, exploring the intersections of humanity and machine. In contrast, Weyes Blood emphasizes the human experience, grounding her reflections in the tangible and the personal. This dichotomy highlights the tension between technological optimism and the desire to preserve humanity’s emotional and spiritual core.

4.3 The Role of Myth and Nostalgia

Grimes’s mythologizing of climate change and Mering’s invocation of nostalgia both function as coping mechanisms for the Anthropocene. By turning to myth and memory, these artists offer alternative frameworks for understanding and responding to the crises of our time.

5. Comparative Analysis

Dimension	Miss Anthropocene (Grimes)	Titanic Rising (Weyes Blood)
Thematic Focus	Mythologized climate change, destruction, posthumanism	Nostalgia, love, loss, and ecological grief
Sonic Style	Industrial, electronic, experimental	Orchestral, soft rock, chamber pop
Vocal Approach	Ethereal, layered, digitally manipulated	Rich, soulful, emotionally direct
Cultural Implications	Posthuman aesthetics, technological transcendence	Humanistic reflection, emotional resilience
Narrative Structure	Fragmented, chaotic	Cohesive, narrative-driven

6. Conclusion

Miss Anthropocene and Titanic Rising are two sides of the same coin, offering contrasting yet complementary responses to the Anthropocene epoch. Grimes’s album invites listeners to confront the chaos and beauty of destruction through a mythological, futuristic lens, while Weyes Blood’s work provides a humanistic, emotionally resonant exploration of love and loss in the face of existential threat. Together, these albums illuminate the multifaceted nature of 21st-century anxieties, offering both catharsis and contemplation.

In their own ways, Grimes and Weyes Blood challenge us to reckon with the Anthropocene’s complexities, using their art to navigate the blurred boundaries between despair and hope, destruction and creation, past and future."

The laugh track of a sitcom played in the background, a jarring juxtaposition to the horror he had wrought. The alcohol had been a crutch, a way to silence the taunts of his past and the noise of his present. But now, it was a liability. He couldn't risk the fog of a hangover, not with the police so close.

He went to the kitchen and filled a glass with water, downing it in one gulp. The cold liquid did little to soothe his parched throat, but it was a start. As he set the glass down, he caught his reflection in the window. The man staring back at him was a ghost, a mere shadow of who he once was. His hand trembled, and he clenched it into a fist to steady himself. He had to get a grip. The whiskey bottle was still there, on the floor, a silent sentinel to his descent.

He decided to clean the kitchen, hoping the repetitive motions would help clear his head. As he wiped down the counters, he noticed a smear of blood, a grim souvenir of his nocturnal escapade. Panic surged through him, and he grabbed a clean cloth, scrubbing furiously at the stain. The smell of bleach filled the room, a harsh contrast to the lingering scent of whiskey. He had to be thorough. He had to be careful.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus, feeling the weight of his recent actions, sits in his cleaned kitchen, watching a sitcom to distract from his guilt. His trembling hand and the whiskey bottle on the floor serve as stark reminders of his struggle. A police welfare check looms, prompting him to clean up a bloodstain, symbolizing his attempt to cover his tracks and maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the horror.

Once the kitchen was spotless, Marcus went to the living room and sat on the couch, his eyes darting around the room. The TV played on, the laughter a hollow echo of the joy that had once filled this space. The walls seemed to whisper of his dark secrets, threatening to give him away. He knew he couldn't stay here, not with the bodies of Larry and Tiffany hidden in plain sight.

He needed an alibi, a foolproof way to account for his whereabouts during the time of the murders. His thoughts turned to his old drinking buddies, the ones he had pushed away when his addiction took over. Could he trust them to cover for him? Or would they be the first to suspect? He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over the contacts. The screen was a blur, his mind racing with possibilities.

He scrolled through the numbers, each name a potential lifeline. Finally, he settled on one: Dave. They hadn't spoken in months, but Marcus knew he owed him a favor. He took a deep breath and dialed, his heart pounding in his chest. The phone rang once, twice, three times before a sleepy voice answered.

""Dave, it's me, Marcus,"" he whispered, the words sticking in his throat. ""Look, I need your help. Something happened last night."" He paused, his mind racing. ""I was at your place, okay? We had a few drinks, and I crashed on your couch. You don't remember because you passed out. That's my story, alright?""

SUMMARY^1: Marcus contemplates the necessity of an alibi, fearful of the police investigation. He decides to use his old drinking buddy, Dave, as a cover. He calls him, creating a false story about being at Dave's place during the murders, hoping the lie will hold and provide the necessary distance from the suspicion that looms.

There was silence on the other end, and for a moment, Marcus feared he had made a mistake. Then, a sigh. ""Alright, man. Whatever you say. But you owe me big time.""

The words were a lifeline, a semblance of safety in a world that was quickly spiraling out of control. Marcus hung up, his hand shaking. He had bought himself some time, but it was only a matter of when, not if, the truth would come out. The silence of the house was a ticking clock, each second bringing him closer to discovery.

He had to act quickly. He needed to move the bodies, to make it look like an accident. His mind raced with the possibilities, the plans forming like shadows in the corners of his thoughts. He knew the neighborhood well, the old factory that had been abandoned for years, the river that flowed through the outskirts, a convenient disposal site for those who knew where to look.

Marcus took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the floor. The house was waking up, the day stretching out before him like a prison sentence. He had to be smart, had to be careful. But as he stood up from the couch, his legs felt like lead. The weight of his actions pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath its inescapable gravity.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus calls his old friend Dave, establishing a false alibi for the night of the murders. He knows the truth can't stay buried forever, and the pressure builds as he considers his next move. The house's silence is a ticking clock, and he plans to relocate the bodies, aiming for a convincing accident scenario. The rising sun is a stark reminder of the dawning reality of his situation, weighing heavily on his shoulders.

He took one last look around the room, memorizing every detail, every potential clue. Then, with a resigned sigh, he turned off the TV and made his way to the basement. The water in the tub was still, a crimson pool that reflected the horror of his actions. Larry's body lay in the water, lifeless, a grotesque parody of peace. Marcus knew he had to act, had to keep moving. The whispers of guilt grew louder, but he pushed them down, focusing on the task at hand.

With trembling hands, he reached into the tub and began to untie the knots that held the cushions in place. The water was warm and sticky, the cushions heavy with the weight of death. He pulled them free, the water gurgling around him as Larry's body shifted, sending ripples across the surface. He stepped back, his eyes avoiding the corpse as he grabbed the plastic bag containing Tiffany's dismembered remains.

The trip to the dumpster was a blur, his mind racing with every step. The alley was still, the shadows holding their breath as he moved through them. The dumpster was a maw of darkness, the perfect receptacle for his sins. With a grunt, he heaved the bag inside, the plastic crunching against the metal. The lid slammed shut, a finality that echoed through the alley.

He stepped back, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of his presence. The delivery man's footsteps echoed in his memory, a reminder that the world was waking up to a day that had irrevocably changed for him. The sun had fully risen now, casting the alley in a harsh, unforgiving light. He took a deep breath, the scent of garbage mingling with the coppery tang of blood.

The police would come, of that he had no doubt. But for now, he had bought himself a little more time. He turned and walked back into the house, the silence of his footsteps a stark contrast to the cacophony in his mind. The whiskey bottle called to him from the floor of his room, a seductive whisper promising to dull the pain.

But Marcus knew he couldn't give in, not now. He had to keep moving, had to stay sharp. He grabbed the phone and called in sick to work, his voice a shaky imitation of his usual gruffness. Then, he began to pack a bag, filling it with essentials: a change of clothes, his wallet, and the TV remote. He had to get out, had to put distance between himself and the bodies.

He took one last look around the room, the whiskey bottle glinting in the light, a silent specter of his past. He left it there, a symbol of his old life, and stepped into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, a mournful tune that seemed to follow him. He closed the door to his room, the sound of the lock clicking into place a mournful echo.

The house was still, the silence a cocoon around him. He moved quickly, gathering his things, the fear of discovery a constant companion. As he descended the stairs, the sunlight spilled in through the windows, painting the walls a warm gold. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that he could leave it all behind, that he could start anew.

But as he stepped outside, the cold reality of his situation hit him like a slap in the face. The world had not stopped turning, the laughter of children playing in the street a mocking contrast to the darkness in his soul. He knew he couldn't outrun the truth, not forever. The bodies would be found, and the whispers would start. He was a killer now, a man with secrets that would never truly die.

He walked to the bus stop, the bag heavy on his shoulder. The TV remote dug into his side, a constant reminder of the lives he had taken. The bus pulled up, its engine purring with the promise of escape. Marcus climbed aboard, the diesel fumes mixing with the scent of his own fear. He took a seat in the back, his eyes on the world outside the window.

The city rolled by in a blur of concrete and steel, a testament to the lives lived and lost. The sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat of the day seeping into his bones. He knew he had to keep moving, had to find a place to hide, to think. But as the bus lurched forward, carrying him away from the scene of his crimes, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He glanced around the bus, his eyes meeting the gazes of the other passengers. They were just faces in the crowd, but to him, they were judges and jurors, ready to condemn him at a moment's notice. His palms grew slick with sweat, and his breath came in shallow gasps. The whispers of his guilt grew louder, drowning out the murmur of the engine.

Marcus stepped off the bus at the next stop, his legs shaking with the effort of maintaining his composure. He wandered aimlessly, the buildings closing in around him like a maze with no exit. The heat was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and despair. He needed a new plan, a way to disappear. The TV was a beacon of hope, a ticket to a new life, if he could just figure out how to use it.

He found a quiet alley, the shadows a comforting embrace. He sat on the ground, the TV remote clutched in his hand like a talisman. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the panic to subside. The whispers grew fainter, and he could almost feel the beginnings of a plan forming in his mind.

He would sell the TV, get some cash, and leave town. He had a friend in the next state over, a man named Jerry who owed him a favor. He could lie low there, build a new life, away from the prying eyes of the police and the specter of his past. The thought brought a glimmer of hope, a spark in the abyss of his fear.

But first, he had to ditch the evidence, the bloody couch cushions and the plastic bag that held the grisly remains of his former neighbors. He found a dumpster, the stench of rotting food a welcome distraction from his own odor of death. He heaved the cushions in, the sound of them landing with a wet thud echoing in the alley. The bag with Tiffany followed, a final goodbye to the life he had destroyed.

Marcus stood for a moment, his eyes closed, listening to the fading sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance grew louder, a symphony of chaos that seemed to be closing in on him. He had to move quickly, had to vanish before the noose tightened.

With a newfound urgency, he hailed a taxi, the TV remote still clutched in his hand. He gave the driver an address, a random number on a street he had never been to before. The car pulled away from the curb, the engine a soothing lullaby as the city blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors.

In the taxi, the whispers grew faint, the guilt a distant memory. For now, he was free, a man on the run with the wind in his hair and the world at his fingertips. But he knew it wouldn't last. The shadows of his past would always follow him, a relentless pursuer that would never tire.

He had to be smarter, had to stay one step ahead. As the car sped through the streets, he began to formulate a new identity, a new life. He would become someone else, leave Marcus and his demons behind. The TV remote was his key to a fresh start, a gateway to a world of anonymity and escape.

The taxi pulled up to a pawnshop, the neon sign flickering in the early morning light. Marcus stepped out, the bag with the TV remote in his pocket. The bell jingled as he pushed open the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and dusty dreams enveloping him. He approached the counter, his heart racing, and laid the remote on the grimy glass.

The pawnbroker looked him over, his eyes shrewd and assessing. ""What's the story with this?"" he asked, his voice gravelly from years of hard living.

Marcus forced a smile, the lie coming easily to his lips. ""It's just a TV remote,"" he said, the words tasting like ash. ""It's not worth much, but I need the cash.""

The pawnbroker studied the remote, then nodded. ""Fifty bucks,"" he said, sliding the money across the counter.

Marcus took the cash, the feel of it in his hand a strange comfort amidst the chaos. He had to be smart now, had to play the part of the desperate man with nothing to hide. He pocketed the money and left the pawnshop, the bell chiming a tune of both liberation and finality. The cash burned a hole in his pocket, a siren song of escape beckoning him westward.

He bought a bus ticket at the station, choosing a route that would take him as far from the city as possible. The line to the counter was long, a serpentine of people with their own stories of despair and hope. He waited, his eyes darting from face to face, searching for any sign of recognition or suspicion. But all he saw were the weary expressions of those trapped in their own struggles, oblivious to the monster in their midst.

The bus ride was a blur of passing scenery and racing thoughts. He had to stay off the grid, find a place where no one would look for him. He had to become someone else, erase every trace of Marcus from existence. The whispers of his past grew fainter with each mile, replaced by the rumble of the engine and the hiss of tires on asphalt.

When the bus finally pulled into a small town, Marcus knew he had found his refuge. The streets were quiet, the buildings old and weathered. It was a place where the world had moved on, leaving behind a quiet dignity that whispered of forgotten secrets and second chances. He stepped off the bus, the warmth of the sun a stark contrast to the cold grip of fear that had held him for so long.

The local diner was a beacon of light, the scent of greasy food and strong coffee a balm to his frayed nerves. He took a seat at the counter, the vinyl stool sticking to his skin. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, brought him a cup of coffee without asking. Her eyes held a knowing look, as if she had seen men like him before, men running from their own shadows.

He took a sip, the liquid scalding his throat, grounding him in the present. For a moment, he allowed himself to feel the warmth of human connection, the comfort of anonymity. But as he glanced at the TV above the counter, the news flashed a story of a gruesome murder, the image of Larry and Tiffany's house plastered on the screen. The whispers grew louder, the noose tightening once more.

Marcus's hand trembled, the cup rattling against the saucer. The waitress's eyes flicked up to meet his, a question in her gaze. He forced a smile, the muscles in his cheeks aching with the effort. ""Just tired,"" he murmured, pushing the coffee away. He couldn't stay here, not now. The whispers had become a roar, a siren's call that would lead the authorities straight to him.

With a heavy heart, he stood up, the TV's chatter a cacophony of accusations. He had to keep moving, had to find a place where the whispers couldn't follow. He stepped out into the sun-drenched street, the TV's remote still in his pocket, a silent testament to the life he had left behind. The world waited for him, vast and unknowable, full of danger and potential.

He walked towards the horizon, the sun a blinding spot in the sky. His steps were unsteady, his breathing ragged. The town grew smaller in the distance, a mirage of a life he could never have. The whispers grew faint, the fear a dull throb in his chest. Marcus knew he couldn't outrun the truth forever, but for now, he had a head start.

The road ahead was long, the future uncertain. But as he disappeared into the horizon, the whispers of his past grew quieter, the promise of a new identity beckoning him onward. The TV remote was a reminder of the life he had stolen, but also a symbol of the power to rewrite his own story.

And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shadows, Marcus took the first step into his new life, the echoes of his past fading with each stride. The quiet of the evening was a balm to his soul, the silence a promise of a life untainted by the cackling laughter of his demons. He had survived the night of blood and whispers, and now, he had to survive the aftermath.

He found a small, dilapidated motel on the outskirts of the next town. The neon sign flickered, the letters spelling out ""VACANCY"" in a seductive dance of light. Marcus approached the office, his heart hammering in his chest. The clerk, an old man with a world-weary gaze, barely looked up as he handed over the key. The room was a sanctuary, the worn-out bed and peeling wallpaper a stark contrast to the gleaming TV that dominated the space.

He turned it on, the static a comforting white noise that drowned out the whispers. The news played in the background, but he couldn't bring himself to watch it. Instead, he stared at the wall, his mind racing with the what-ifs and hows. How long could he keep this up? Would he ever find peace?

The knock on the door startled him, sending his heart into a frenzy. He approached it, his hand on the knob, his breath shallow. When he peeked through the peephole, he saw a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She clutched a plastic bag, her knuckles white. ""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I need help.""

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of doubt and suspicion. He knew he should turn her away, keep moving, stay hidden. But something in her eyes, a flicker of innocence lost, called to him. He opened the door, the chill of the evening air a slap to the face. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice gruff, unused to kindness.

Her story spilled out, a tale of a world crueler than he could ever imagine. Her father had gone missing, leaving her alone with a mother who had turned to drugs and abuse. Marcus felt a twinge of pity, a spark of something he thought he had lost. He offered her a bed for the night, a sandwich, and the quiet refuge of his room.

As they sat on the bed, the TV playing a mindless sitcom, she talked of her dreams, her hopes, her fears. The whispers grew quieter, drowned out by the steady rhythm of her voice. And for a brief moment, Marcus allowed himself to feel something other than the cold grip of guilt. He saw in her a reflection of himself, a soul adrift in a sea of chaos.

When she finally fell asleep, her head on his shoulder, the TV still playing, Marcus sat in the darkness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him. He knew he couldn't save her, couldn't save anyone. But he could give her a night of peace, a small reprieve from the horrors that awaited her outside.

The whispers grew faint, the TV's glow a comforting presence in the gloom. He sat there, the remote in his hand, the power to change the channel a symbol of his dwindling control over his own fate. But as the night stretched on, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. He knew that soon, the past would catch up with him, the bodies would be found, and the hunt would begin anew.

With a heavy sigh, Marcus stood up, the girl's head rolling onto the pillow. He knew he had to go, had to leave before the whispers grew too loud to ignore. He gathered his things, the TV remote a silent witness to the brief connection he had allowed himself. He stepped out into the night, the motel's neon glow a beacon of the life he had left behind.

The stars above twinkled like a thousand accusatory eyes, but he ignored them, focusing on the road ahead. The whispers had become a constant companion, a reminder of the lives he had taken and the price he would pay. But for now, he had to keep moving, had to stay one step ahead of the inevitable.

The night was long, the miles stretching out before him like a black ribbon of uncertainty. The TV remote felt heavier with each step, a burden that weighed on his soul. But it was also a reminder of the power to choose, to rewrite his story. And so, he walked into the darkness, the whispers of his past a fading echo, the promise of a new dawn a beacon in the distance."
Upping my dose??,Anxiety,1i9l32g,2025-01-25 06:32:33,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1i9l32g/upping_my_dose/,Left_Crazy348,Medication,"i posted this exact post in r/zoloft, but i’m trying to get as many people’s opinions as possible. (plus i’m kind of freaking out rn lol)

i’ve been on and off zoloft a few times now, but the past maybe two times have been borderline traumatic with the side effects during the regulation period. I would say i’ve been on 50mg for a few months now, and as of late (the past maybe 4 days) my anxiety has slowly been creeping back up. now, it’s nothing like it was with full blown panic attacks, vomiting, sobbing, etc. this time it’s more or less occasional chest pains, air hunger, tense shoulders, looming feeling of something bad happening, heat flashes, and trouble falling/staying asleep. 

it’s probably worth noting that this also started around the time i’m assuming i pulled a muscle near my right shoulder blade. it’s already gotten better, it used to hurt to swallow and breathe 24/7 but now it’s only every once in a while. i have horrible health anxiety. 

i guess what i’m asking from an outsider perspective that has also dealt with crippling anxiety while actively taking zoloft. should i up my meds ASAP? or do you guys think it’s just a little blurb of anxiety because of the pinch in my shoulder blade. "

"I Wrote a Storybible for a 2 Season Halloween TV Series With Sam Loomis as the Main Character and I Wanted to Get Feedback on the Concept. The Series Would be Called ""Loomis"".",horror,1i9kto8,2025-01-25 06:14:15,0,0.3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1i9kto8/i_wrote_a_storybible_for_a_2_season_halloween_tv/,CharlieBoy6068,Discussion,"""Loomis"" would be a 2 season tv series following the events of Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) in real time. All from the perspective of Sam Loomis and never breaking from it. It is a sidequel to the original 2 films. Filling in the gaps in what Loomis was doing.

Consider it a psychological character study of Sam Loomis. It would start from when Michael escapes from the sanitarium and ending with the explosion in Halloween II. Taking place over a total of 31 hours. My main inspirations for the series would be The Fugitive, Moby Dick, and 24. With a massive dose of Hill House style psychological horror.

I also go out of my way to not recreate scenes or iconic kills from the first 2 movies, especially the first film, instead focusing on Loomis's perspective and never breaking from it. In season 1 for example, you only really start seeing scenes from the first film in the pilot and in the season one finale. Because I am restricted to what Loomis witnessed, but that is the part I find exciting. Getting too expand on that chase to Haddonfield that was only implied in the original. While also doing a character study on Loomis and his obsession. With Michael more or less being a catalyst for everything that happens.

Below is the episode guide I've planned out for it. Again, it would only be 2 seasons. Here they are straight from my storybible. It will be all about the pacing and suspense of this 1 man, man-hunt taking place over 31 hours (which was a happy accident). All the episode titles are quotes, song titles, or references to the films. Mainly the classics, (Halloween 1-6)
