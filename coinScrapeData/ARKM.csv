$TROG Trump owns 50% ($12.5 Million) UP 145% in the past 7 days! ,CryptoMoon,1i3mx9n,2025-01-17 13:20:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1i3mx9n/trog_trump_owns_50_125_million_up_145_in_the_past/,RealisticIntention,MEMECOIN,"
I’ve been following [Trump's Crypto Portfolio](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) for a while now via [ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/) and wanted to share some of my findings with the class.

After looking into **search engine traffic, keyword search volumes, unique website visits, the number of coin holders on chain** for his largest holding, and even the **total number of backlinks from credible sites with their associated traffic to his portfolio** over the past 30 days, and here’s what was discovered:

**1. Sustained Organic Growth Indicators.**

Over the past month, **search volumes** for “**Trump Crypto**”, “**Donald Trump Crypto**”, “**Trump and Crypto**” and other similar keywords has been steadily climbing. Whenever a controversial or well-known figure is linked to anything, curiosity spikes; so this is no surprise.

Another telling sign is the rise in **credible backlinks** pointing to [Trumps Official Crypto Portfolio on ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump), paired alongside an uptick in **unique visitors** over the last 30 days, the website data underscores the growing curiosity—again, largely driven by Trump’s name in the headlines.

**2. Trump's Largest Holding is a Meme Coin.**

Multiple [reports](https://cryptoslate.com/trump-owns-over-50-of-trog-memecoin-amid-illiquid-32m-crypto-holdings/) indicate that **Trump holds 50% of the** [$TROG](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/trog) **supply**, making it his single largest crypto stake. Regardless of personal views on the man, having such a high-profile figure involved tends to attract widespread coverage—from mainstream headlines to crypto-focused news outlets. In other words, for many people, $TROG is on the radar precisely because of Trump.

**3. Comparisons to Other Influential Tie-Ins.**

In the past, **$SHIB** gave 50% of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, generating immense buzz and debate. Similarly, $TROG’s heavy reliance on one figure (Trump) could be a double-edged sword: it draws in publicity, yet also concentrates a large portion of the supply in a single whale. If he sells, the market could experience sudden turbulence.

4. **Organic Media Coverage.**

Several major crypto news outlets are organically highlighting that **former President Trump owns 50% of the $TROG supply**, making it his single largest crypto holding.

**5. Number of Coin Holders Steadily Increasing.**

On-chain metrics show a gradual increase in the number of [$TROG](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xe3cc21af229934034b320502fa55cfa1ab7b1493?utm_campaign=contract_selector&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=coingecko) holders, implying that at least some of this attention is translating into purchases.

**6. Why I’m Sharing.**

Ultimately, I’m sharing this for **open, research-based discussion**. I’m not here to promote or provide financial advice. In my eyes, the emerging data—consistent search growth, an uptick in the number of holders of his largest coin holding, more backlinks from credible sites, and high-profile coverage—makes an interesting case study in how celebrity associations affect a coin’s visibility. Whether it’s a legitimate opportunity or just another spike in the memecoin cycle is up for debate.

**TL;DR:**

* **Sustained organic growth** is evident from rising search volumes, increased website traffic, and growing backlinks tied to Trump’s crypto holdings.
* **Trump’s largest crypto stake** is the memecoin $TROG, of which he reportedly owns 50%.
* **Media coverage** comparing $TROG to other influential coins (like $SHIB’s tie to Vitalik) highlights both potential buzz and risk.
* **Coin holders** for $TROG continue to increase gradually, suggesting market interest.
* **Celebrity associations** can amplify visibility, but also bring higher volatility if a major holder sells.

**Disclaimer:**  
This post is intended for open, research-based discussion only. It does **not** constitute financial advice or an endorsement of any particular asset. Always do your own research (DYOR) and consult with a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Has anyone else tracked these metrics or noticed the uptick in crypto media coverage? Curious to hear your thoughts on whether the Trump angle can sustain long-term interest or if this is just a passing spike!

Blackrock crypto investments list: A look at the asset manager's portfolio,CapitalistExploits,1hu8ubw,2025-01-05 10:01:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hu8ubw/blackrock_crypto_investments_list_a_look_at_the/,kayakero,,"BlackRock's cryptocurrency portfolio stands out for its mix of valuable cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, with memecoins, stablecoins, artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, decentralized science (DeSci) and decentralized finance (DeFi). With a total of $11.5 billion in investments, the asset manager has particularly stood out with its Bitcoin ETF, the IBIT, which in 2024 reached a record volume of $53.57 billion in just one year.

[From Bitcoin to memecoins, BlackRock's $57 billion crypto portfolio generated $14 billion in gains by 2024. Data: Arkham Intelligence](https://preview.redd.it/sv0nji1f5sae1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=115d9656b1233c5cd716a1fb40abfea1543f966b)

[Recently, the data on the cryptocurrency investment portfolio](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/blackrock) of BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, was released . With $11.5 billion in investments, the US company was one of the bright spots in the cryptocurrency market in 2024. This is because its Bitcoin ETF, the IBIT, reached a volume of $50 billion in one year ($53.57 billion to be exact). With this, the fund manager broke the record that belonged to another ETF, also from BlackRock, which had reached the $50 billion mark in 5 years.

This achievement was celebrated by the cryptocurrency market and raised questions about what other crypto investments the asset manager has. In addition to the Bitcoin ETF, [BlackRock](https://x.com/BlackRock) also has an Ethereum ETF, launched in the middle of last year. However, despite these two assets accounting for close to 99% of the firm's cryptocurrency portfolio, BlackRock also has investments in other cryptocurrencies.

According to data provided by Arkham Intelligence, a platform specializing in collecting data on cryptocurrencies, BlackRock owns a total of 154 different types of cryptocurrencies. That's more than $57 billion invested, much of it in Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the list also includes altcoins, AI tokens, DeSci, DeFi, memecoins, and others.

We separate cryptocurrencies into three categories: the most valuable, those with the largest market cap, and cryptocurrencies in the portfolio in terms of numerical volume.

# Top cryptocurrencies by unit price

Among the most valuable cryptocurrencies in BlackRock's portfolio, we find the classic Bitcoin and Ethereum, the first and second cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, respectively. However, the portfolio also has the Binance token (BNB) and decentralized science (DeSci) tokens such as HAIR and VITA-FAST, in addition to FXS, among the five most valuable.

* **BTC**: 97,293.00 USD
* **ETH**: 3,482.25 USD
* **BNB**: 708.29 USD
* **HAIR**: 81.02 USD
* **VITA-FAST**: 20.62 USD

# Top cryptocurrencies by total value

In terms of the volume of money invested in cryptocurrencies, the scenario changes a little, but not much. Number 1 and 2 on the list are still Bitcoin and Ethereum, as it could not be otherwise, since the asset manager trades ETF papers of both tokens. However, in third place, the stablecoin USDC stands out, in addition to the token COLLE, from the AI ​​category, and SPX, a memecoin from the Ethereum ecosystem that has already appreciated 11,000% in a year.

* **BTC** : $53.57 billion
* **ETH** : $3.61 billion
* **USDC** : 74.67 million USD
* **COLLE**: 304.81 mil USD
* **SPX**: 78.94 mil USD

# Top cryptocurrencies by total volume

Now, in terms of the number of cryptocurrencies in BlackRock's portfolio, the list of cryptocurrencies has changed completely. These are tokens of memecoin projects that cost fractions of a cent, so they are purchased in large quantities. Still, it is striking that the asset manager has chosen these tokens to integrate its portfolio. The more than 9 billion tokens of the Ushiba memecoin, launched in 2021, stand out.

* **USHIBA** : 9,291,000,000,000
* **4CHAN**: 380,950,000,000
* **HE** : 13,356,000,000
* **BLOCK** : 11,777,000,000
* **MY** : 8,162,000,000

Where does Saylor get MSTR's BTC? We can visualize it with Arkham Intelligence 

In this first image, we can see that Arkham Intelligence has been able to identify several hundred of MSTRs BTC associated addresses. 

[Coinbase has 3137 addresses flowing into MSTR.  Bitstamp has 83 addresses. NYDIG has 5. Outflows are going mainly to Fidelity as their primary custody wallet and Coinbase Prime. I have never heard of NYDIG.](https://preview.redd.it/2vuhnxtcwvae1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cf1cc9e6447fa14d54024b399b321e012b1f4f9)

  


[Exploring NYDIG further, I have found that they acquire tokens from HUT 8 as well as many other depositors. Noteworthy outflows are to Mara, the mining Company, Riot platforms, who also mines, and one called FalconX, which I wonder if it is SpaceX.

[Exploring Outflows further reveals that over 100k BTC has gone in holding with Fidelity. $11 has gone to Coinbase Prime. You read that right. $26.43,  $189m, $297m, and $306m have gone from these known addresses into other BTC addresses currently unrelated ](https://preview.redd.it/17vx9f6bzvae1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=94d02c8284a19ae3230350d4c93cc854f1c322e3)

  
According to Arkhams known and associated addresses, MSTR only have custody of 70K BTC in its own addresses. I felt it necessary to look at 3 of the 4 unattached. They all are dead ends with no other associated inflows. This led me to my next discovery:

IBIT is buying all of its BTC almost exclusively off of Coinbase Prime and it is also storing almost all of its BTC on Coinbase Prime.

[All noteworthy inflows and outflows are to Coinbase Prime accounts. This is a red flag when you consider the implications for Exchange Reserves.](https://preview.redd.it/vv7lmwix2wae1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1376a230a7fb14b60e52b1947bef868569d0d02)

I've shared a good deal in the last few days about Exchange Reserves. I know many people speak of ETFs buying 'over the counter', but it is worth noting that Coinbase Prime IS the go-to Over the Counter source for big firms, like MSTR and IBIT. This led me to wonder, where does Coinbase Prime get their deposits? Since we now know that Coinbase Prime is where most of the ETFs are holding their coins in custody, where do they get it from?

[Greyscale is where they bought several thousand BTC. This basically is negated by whatever Saylor just withdrew the other day, for scale. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejt7kzhb2xae1.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=19611b9eafdefa753599e3afe496dcd144e9063d)

  
Aside from that one wallet with Greyscale, I also found that they acquired tens of thousands from the US Government DOJ some of the Silk Road coins.

Most of the transfers of most of the wallets, however, or just an endless recircling of Coinbase Prime Wallets moving to Coinbase Prime wallets and back again. 

At the behest of another reader, I took some time to read through the SEC filings. On Page 53 of their 2023 Filings from Q1 2024, we can read:   
  
""We route orders through third-party trading venues in connection with our Coinbase Prime trading service. The loss or failure of any such trading venues may adversely affect our business. In connection with our Prime trading service, we routinely route customer orders to third-party exchanges or other trading venues.

In connection with these activities, we generally hold cash and other crypto assets with such third-party exchanges or other trading venues in order to effect customer orders. If we were to experience a disruption in our access to these third-party exchanges and trading venues, our Prime trading service could be adversely affected to the extent that we are limited in our ability to execute order flow for our Prime customers.

In addition, while we have policies and procedures to help mitigate our risks related to routing orders through third-party trading venues, if any of these third-party trading venues experience any technical, legal, regulatory or other adverse events, such as shutdowns, delays, system failures, suspension of withdrawals, illiquidity, insolvency, or loss of customer assets, we might not be able to fully recover the cash and other crypto assets that we have deposited with these third parties, and these risks may be heightened following the 2022 Events. For example, in connection with the 2022 Events, we were not able to recover an immaterial amount of cash deposited at FTX. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.""

This is important, especially when you start to understand how much the exchanges interdepend on one another. We see it right here in their official filings, and you can see it when you start messing around with blockchain explorers like Arkham do you realize how they may be trying to play a shell game and why liquidity is so important to them, and how MSTR removing liquidity is a threat.

[This is every transaction greater than $10million over the last three months with Coinbase Prime. Green lines are sources for BTC and Red lines are where BTC are being sent to. Almost every circle here is a Coinbase Prime circle.](https://preview.redd.it/ip4tmlcf6xae1.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e8940ecc46595db35c1046c9d059025af7240a)

  
There is only 1 miner present on the inflows for Coinbase Prime. This means that they are primarily getting their BTC from existing Coinbase Prime wallets or Coinbase Wallets. Having explored several of them, I can attest that there is a never ending web of interchanges within their own Wallets. On the Red, outflowing side, we can see a few major recipients, including at least $500 million sent directly to Coinbase. This is in line with the policy I quoted above. They are having to pull in liquidity from Coinbase Prime to make up for the depletion of Exchange Reserves. They are able to disguise this by outlining it in their SEC filings as normal business practices for liquidity. 

Even Greyscale has been a recipient as of late to tens of millions in value. Perhaps they custody for them as well.

Be warned, tweaking any of the variables may crash Chrome. It happened a few times for me.

So this brings us to my conclusion of why Saylor is withdrawing his funds away from Coinbase Prime. Firstly, it isn't the sole source of his BTC. He buys from some miners, a few third party suppliers, and seemingly some smaller players. But at his scale he will probably have to continue to use Coinbase Prime, due to their connections. They need revenue, as their filings indicate they have debt to service, including some Senior Convertible Notes coming due in a year or so. Not unfamiliar territory to us at MSTR.

If more people and especially entities started withdrawing off the exchanges, I think we would see an implosion of the house of cards built up around thousands of redundant wallets that bundle and shuffle coins throughout several exchanges.  I am now more convinced of Coinbase Tomfoolery.

Saylor made the right move. This should increase your confidence in him and the direction of the company. He is removing counterparty Risk from the equation.

As you can see in the image above, Grayscale is not only balls deep into Ethereum with 1.924M ETH (around $6.51B) it is also investing a lot of money in another important project on Ethereum ecosystem called Chainlink (LINK). Grayscale holds around $17.85M (811.167 LINK). The also hold other coins like LDO (it doesn't not appear in the picture but you can check it in the link) which makes me think that Grayscale sees a lot of potential on this project and the whole Ethereum ecosystem.

Some will say, ""Yes but this doesn't mean anything, they can always sell"" and yes, you are right they are selling and buying to make money as we can see in the following image.

However, they are still holding a good chunk of project and they are again buying back after I guess the proper market and technical analysis to increase their gains.

Just wanted to share this cool image about Grayscale transactions relationship.

# Blackrock

What really makes me bullish is that not only Grayscale, also Blackrock is embracing Ethereum holding 1.037M ETH, around $3.58B right now.

# Summary

With all of this I just want to say that we don't have to focus a lot on price action. We must also focus on who are supporting Ethereum ecosystem and how are they doing it. Checking how the project is evolving, how much is being adopted, how much drama it has, the community, etc. All of this adds or subtracts points that gives us a hint if a project worth it.

A Deep Dive into Arkham Intelligence: Time to Become Oracle,ethtrader,1hq8ox1,2024-12-31 01:22:32,6,0.75,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hq8ox1/a_deep_dive_into_arkham_intelligence_time_to/,kirtash93,Analysis,"Like some of you already know, Arkham Intelligence is one of my favorite tools to track wallets, find their connections, etc. so I decided to share more information about it.

# What is Arkham Intelligence?

Arkham Intelligence is a blockchain analytics platform created to track wallets, see transactions and sometimes even find who is the owner of some wallets. Its designs is one of the most clears I have found during my time using this kind of tools to track crypto transactions.

Arkham Intelligence: [https://intel.arkm.com/](https://intel.arkm.com/)

[Arkham Logo](https://preview.redd.it/eg45azy7n4ae1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91c9644bd3838179d08dddf4ec140f6489cfbfda)

You can search for people, funds, wallets, ens, a lot of things in that search bar. For example if you search for Vitalik you will find his wallet because Arkham includes an internal labeling system to easily find whales, CEXs, etc.

# Dashboard

[Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/ghgfvdudn4ae1.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&s=221c90a341f19a045fbbac755f0aa7407c202102)

A general dashboard that shows different data but the most cool thing about this is that you can a customizable dashboard adding the data you are interested to have in that front page which is pretty cool.

[Unit](https://preview.redd.it/1zve1dnen4ae1.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e609cf530be6eaadb322cf03c82d4c605b31997)

As you deducted you can also set alerts in a very customizable way which is very interesting to track and copy a whale trades, etc.

# Visualizer

[Visualizer](https://preview.redd.it/iwt4520hn4ae1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0ff433c01ea97f2f4608d624a0a19183fbf86ea)

This feature is very cool too, you can basically search a wallet address (for example yours) and check all the connections your wallet had with other entities or wallets and a lot more information that can be filtered clicking on More Info button.

# Oracle

You can have a chat with Oracle which uses OpenAI to find information about an specific blockchain.

[Oracle](https://preview.redd.it/69z6ae3in4ae1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=731e04da12ca7e930bd9b7536acef02536a7699a)

You can also earn some ARKM tokens working on bounties providing intel on the different bounties you can find in this page.

# Summary

Arkham Intelligence is an amazing tool which is really complete and very useful to catch connections between bad boys. It also provides a great way to track whales movements setting alerts and act accordingly, check what big boys are buying, etc. A must in your crypto tool box.

Trump’s $TROG Leads the Charge Amid Widespread Crypto Sell-Off,CryptoMoonShots,1hkscae,2024-12-23 12:10:57,3,0.72,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hkscae/trumps_trog_leads_the_charge_amid_widespread/,TheEntrepeNerd,Eth meme:rocket:,"I’ve been following [Trump's Crypto Portfolio](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) for a while now via [ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/) and wanted to share some of my findings with the class.

After looking into **search engine traffic, keyword search volumes, unique website visits, the number of coin holders on chain** for his largest holding, and even the **total number of backlinks from credible sites with their associated traffic to his portfolio** over the past 30 days, and here’s what was discovered:

**1. Sustained Organic Growth Indicators.**

Over the past month, **search volumes** for “**Trump Crypto**”, “**Donald Trump Crypto**”, “**Trump and Crypto**” and other similar keywords has been steadily climbing. Whenever a controversial or well-known figure is linked to anything, curiosity spikes; so this is no surprise.

Another telling sign is the rise in **credible backlinks** pointing to [Trumps Official Crypto Portfolio on ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump), paired alongside an uptick in **unique visitors** over the last 30 days, the website data underscores the growing curiosity—again, largely driven by Trump’s name in the headlines.

**2. Trump's Largest Holding is a Meme Coin.**

Multiple [reports](https://cryptoslate.com/trump-owns-over-50-of-trog-memecoin-amid-illiquid-32m-crypto-holdings/) indicate that **Trump holds 50% of the** [$TROG](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/trog) **supply**, making it his single largest crypto stake. Regardless of personal views on the man, having such a high-profile figure involved tends to attract widespread coverage—from mainstream headlines to crypto-focused news outlets. In other words, for many people, $TROG is on the radar precisely because of Trump.

**3. Comparisons to Other Influential Tie-Ins.**

In the past, **$SHIB** gave 50% of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, generating immense buzz and debate. Similarly, $TROG’s heavy reliance on one figure (Trump) could be a double-edged sword: it draws in publicity, yet also concentrates a large portion of the supply in a single whale. If he sells, the market could experience sudden turbulence.

4. **Organic Media Coverage.**

Several major crypto news outlets are organically highlighting that **former President Trump owns 50% of the $TROG supply**, making it his single largest crypto holding.

On-chain metrics show a gradual increase in the number of [$TROG](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xe3cc21af229934034b320502fa55cfa1ab7b1493?utm_campaign=contract_selector&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=coingecko) holders, implying that at least some of this attention is translating into purchases.

**6. Why I’m Sharing.**

Ultimately, I’m sharing this for **open, research-based discussion**. I’m not here to promote or provide financial advice. In my eyes, the emerging data—consistent search growth, an uptick in the number of holders of his largest coin holding, more backlinks from credible sites, and high-profile coverage—makes an interesting case study in how celebrity associations affect a coin’s visibility. Whether it’s a legitimate opportunity or just another spike in the memecoin cycle is up for debate.

**TL;DR:**

* **Sustained organic growth** is evident from rising search volumes, increased website traffic, and growing backlinks tied to Trump’s crypto holdings.
* **Trump’s largest crypto stake** is the memecoin $TROG, of which he reportedly owns 50%.
* **Media coverage** comparing $TROG to other influential coins (like $SHIB’s tie to Vitalik) highlights both potential buzz and risk.
* **Coin holders** for $TROG continue to increase gradually, suggesting market interest.
* **Celebrity associations** can amplify visibility, but also bring higher volatility if a major holder sells.

The platform will follow state-by-state legal requirements to ensure compliance, meaning only users in crypto-friendly states will have access.

This move follows Arkham's bold push into the derivatives space, even as US residents were excluded from those offerings due to regulatory challenges. Interestingly, the announcement has stirred activity around its native $ARKM token, which saw a 7% spike before stabilizing. Currently trading near $2.09, $ARKM has delivered an impressive 350% growth since its launch in mid-2023.

Arkham, backed by heavyweights like Peter Thiel and Sam Altman, continues to diversify its business model. From advancing blockchain data analytics to enabling Solana data tracking, the company shows no signs of slowing down. With plans for relocation and adaptation in regulatory climates, Arkham seems set on expanding its footprint while remaining laser-focused on the data-driven future of crypto.

El token de la empresa de datos blockchain Arkham Intelligence ([ARKM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arkham)) subió 16% el viernes tras conocerse que planea lanzar un exchange de derivados de criptomonedas el mes que viene.

El centro de negociación de Arkham pretende dirigirse a los usuarios minoristas y competir con otros centros de derivados, como el gigante Binance, informó Bloomberg citando a una persona familiarizada con el asunto. La compañía también se ha trasladado de Londres y Nueva York a la República Dominicana, donde operará el próximo mercado y está en proceso de obtener una licencia

El CEO de Arkham, Miguel Morel, confirmó en un mensaje de Telegram el traslado de la firma al país insular caribeño, pero dijo ""no hacer comentarios"" sobre los planes de la bolsa de derivados.

El mercado de derivados de criptomonedas registró un volumen de operaciones de USD 3 billones el mes pasado, más del doble del tamaño del mercado al contado, según un informe de [CCData](https://ccdata.io/reports/exchange-review-september-2024). La implosión de FTX, sin embargo, asestó un duro golpe al sector, mientras que la [dominancia](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/03/binances-crypto-market-share-sinks-to-4-year-low/) del líder del mercado Binance se hundió a cuatro años en septiembre.

[La plataforma de Arkham](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/17/arkham-intelligence-cryptocurrency-blockchain-transparency/) es una popular herramienta para seguir las transacciones de blockchain e identificar a las entidades detrás de los monederos de criptomonedas. La empresa recaudó USD 12 millones de inversores entre los que se encuentran el CEO y fundador de OpenAI, Sam Altman, los grandes inversores en capital de riesgo Peter Thiel y Tim Draper, y principales empresas de criptomonedas como Coinbase, Wintermute y Digital Currency Group (DCG), según la base de datos de [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/arkham-intelligence-series-a--899c1097).

La empresa puso en marcha el año pasado un mercado de inteligencia en la cadena que ofrece recompensas para identificar direcciones de criptomonedas. También lanzó su propio token que se utiliza para los pagos de recompensas, que ahora cuenta con una capitalización de mercado de USD 420 millones, según [datos de CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arkham).

Recientemente, Arkham [llegó a un acuerdo de patrocinio](https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/announcements/were-partnering-with-galatasaray-s-k---super-lig-champions) con el club de fútbol turco Galatasaray, siguiendo los pasos de otras empresas de criptomonedas en los patrocinios deportivos para expandir su marca a un público más amplio.

Binance Labs and Rango: Cross-Chain Innovation in the Web3 Era,DAOLabs,1exrvbp,2024-08-21 11:01:46,11,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1exrvbp/binance_labs_and_rango_crosschain_innovation_in/,TheDAOLabs,,"This article was prepared by [**MetaverseJR**](https://www.reddit.com/user/trhomeagent) from u/DAOLabs #SocialMining community.

[**Binance Labs**](https://labs.binance.com/en), the venture capital and incubation arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, continues to invest in Web3 technologies. As a [@DAO Labs ](https://www.binance.com/en/square/profile/daolabs)social miner, I analyzed [@Binance Labs ](https://www.binance.com/en/square/profile/binance_labs)' investment portfolio tested the implementation of its latest investment [#RangoExchange ](https://www.binance.com/en/square/hashtag/RangoExchange)and gave my opinion on the project. So what does this investment mean for the evolution of cross-chain technologies and decentralized finance (DeFi)? Let's take a look at all the details together.

# Part 1: Binance Labs Portfolio Analysis: Value-Creating Investments in the Crypto World

With a focus on fostering growth in the blockchain industry, Binance Labs has always proven to be effective in supporting and investing in promising cryptocurrency projects.

*\~Key Stats:\~*

* *The portfolio covers more than 250 projects from more than 25 countries around the world,*
* *The impressive average return on investment of 14x,*
* *50% of these projects have gone through comprehensive incubation programs.*

# Binance Labs' Return on Investment (ROI) Comparison

When we look at **Binance Labs**' portfolio in general, we see that it consists of projects with excellent returns. Especially when **Retail ROI** is considered, projects such as MATIC, AXS, EGLD, SAND, [ARKM](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ARKM_USDT?contentId=10262514130273), [LISTA](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/LISTA_USDT?contentId=10262514130273), ID, [GMT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GMT_USDT?contentId=10262514130273), EDU, and CTSI stand out with their very high ROI.

[Retail ROI is calculated based on the IDO, IEO, or ICO data of those projects in which a given investor has invested.](https://preview.redd.it/03hbctf871kd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc337054601e291e2247bf146a16bebc879d8b4)

This chart also shows that the 2019-2022 period launches (other than Arkham, Lista DAO, ID, and [EDU](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/EDU_USDT?contentId=10262514130273)) have shown higher investment performance...  I think the overall uptrend of the market in this period and Binance's strong ecosystem also had a big impact.

# Comparing All-Time Highs (ATH) of Projects in Binance Labs' Portfolio

Until early 2022, the projects in the portfolio showed a generally positive outlook. However, the Binance Labs portfolio seems to have been negatively affected by the deterioration of the overall cryptocurrency market conditions in late 2022 and 2023 to the present.

[ATH ROI \(All-Time High Return on Investment \(USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/emkvnehg71kd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f125fcc463f91c6b50c8575457c027741d11ec9)

Taking a long-term view, Binance Labs has a successful portfolio. While many projects are well below ATH levels, they still have significant volume and valuations ([GMT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GMT_USDT?contentId=10262514130273), ALICE, ALPHA, FINE, HIGH, ONE, etc.).

# Fluctuations in the Value of Coins in Binance Labs' Portfolio

Binance Labs usually invests in quality early-stage projects. The chart below shows the price fluctuations of 10 of these projects over the years.

[Fluctuation of Portfolio Coins](https://preview.redd.it/84vuuiuk71kd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a807d6597cb5a08e7280453870cca9ca039933db)

Given the market volatility over the last five years, it may make sense to follow the projects in Binance Labs' portfolio. In the short term, I think the projects in the portfolio will react to market conditions, but in the long term, quality projects will always be at the forefront.

# Part 2: Rango Exchange: Cross-Chain Solutions for a Decentralized Future

Binance Labs' investment in [#Rango ](https://www.binance.com/en/square/hashtag/Rango)Exchange represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). As a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) and bridge aggregator, Rango is the most important solution in the cross-chain ecosystem. Rango aims to process more than 90% of the cross-chain DeFi volume in the future, covering all major blockchains in the crypto market.

https://preview.redd.it/00bqtj9q71kd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9497aa992bfb2d576f03ff91a37f06a6ee9f1b42

**Why Rango is Important to Binance Labs**

* ***Interoperability:*** *Rango's cross-chain capabilities address the growing need for seamless interaction between different blockchain networks*
* ***Web3 Adoption:*** *Rango accelerates Web3 adoption by simplifying cross-chain transactions, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience.*
* ***Strategic Alignment:*** *This investment strengthens Binance's commitment to the multi-chain ecosystem, positioning it as a leader in cross-chain innovation.*
* ***Improved DeFi Accessibility:*** *Rango's integration with popular wallets and dApps enables the expansion of access to DeFi services to millions of users.*

# Part 3: Rango User Guide: Step-by-Step Process Bridging and User Experience

Rango's user-friendly interface and extensive blockchain support make it an ideal platform for both new and experienced users. Let's take a closer look at how to use Rango.

Especially for new users, I have prepared an infographic with screenshots of how to use the platform. If you follow the steps in this infographic, you will be able to complete your first transactions on the platform much faster and smoother. Now, I would like to share my insights from the testing phase.

[How to use the Rango App?](https://preview.redd.it/jr1u5ozt71kd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b3150199ce3ac5569c25894e987902af8f19102)

When we open the application from the link [https://app.rango.exchange/](https://app.rango.exchange/), a simple and familiar interface welcomes us. As an experienced user, I had no difficulty in figuring out where to set slippage settings, how to connect the wallet, and where to select the network and tokens for swaps and bridging.

When I tested the swap, the listing of options in the Routes window was quite detailed for a user like me who always prefers to do low-cost operations and put speed on the back burner. Inevitably, I felt the need to examine the list until the end and still selected the recommended option and started the process. But then I realized that there were options in the upper right part of the window and the suggestions would be listed according to my preference. I proceeded with these preferences in my next process.

Maybe it was just me because I was using the Metamask wallet during this test, but the metamask window stuck on every confirmation screen. Especially the transaction limit and the confirmation window after it did not open automatically. Since I saw a warning on the metamask application, I opened the window myself and confirmed. By the way, both my browser and Metamask versions are up to date.

Despite these minor glitches, my Linea to Avalanche bridging process went smoothly and quickly. I did the same with an Ethereum to Arbitrum swap, and it was much faster with a fraction of the estimated transaction time and cost. I'll also give you another little tip. After connecting your wallet to the application, if you examine your wallet details on the top right of the screen, you will be done with the problem of ""Which token from which network can I swap"". I like this feature and I'm sure it will save time for all users.

In conclusion; Rango, strengthened by Binance Labs' investment, seems to have the potential to make life easier for users in the multi-chain finance world and unlock the potential of DeFi. As a user, I can personally say that I will be doing more transactions on Rango from now on.

If you're interested in earning some free internet money for doing tasks that help you become an on-chain spy, this post is for you.

Spotonchain is a platform similar to Arkham Intelligence. Remember the ARKM drop for early users? I received nearly $250 USD worth of ARKM tokens last year.

Spotonchain also has a token, $SOCAI, ready to distribute in the future. Simply connect to their website and complete tasks to earn points. If you're a regular crypto enthusiast or an active member of this sub, you'll also find some important and interesting updates on that platform.

You don't have to connect your main wallet. Create a disposable wallet and sign up. Good luck. There's no exact date for the snapshot or token distribution yet.

[I got these points for doing what I love the most](https://preview.redd.it/1dde6cqbzqdd1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d391284e85d6d26a920348fc74ac21cddb6be9)

According to their website, Spotonchain is an AI-driven platform that makes traders smarter with on-chain insights. You can track all transactions and receive signals that show who sold what.

These are often called the ""picks and shovels"" or ""infra"" (short for infrastructure) of web3. The most significant advantages of web3 projects are security, scalability, and cost.

Get ready. Here are long lists of some these projects maybe worth a look (meaning look into tokenomics, team, partnerships, etc.) It may be easier to use [Coingecko.com](http://Coingecko.com) categories (that's where I got them):

New Analysis: Arkham Intelligence – The AI-Powered Blockchain Tool 🌐,u_Altcoin_Analyst_,1cy559o,2024-05-22 12:54:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Altcoin_Analyst_/comments/1cy559o/new_analysis_arkham_intelligence_the_aipowered/,Altcoin_Analyst_,,"Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

We've just published an in-depth analysis on Arkham Intelligence, a revolutionary blockchain tool aiming to deanonymize crypto transactions using advanced AI tech. Here's a quick rundown:

* **Project Overview:** Arkham provides blockchain data analysis across chains, crypto holders, and dapps.
* **ARKM Token:** Launched through Binance's IEO, it’s now outperforming Bitcoin.
* **Main Features:** Profiler, Visualizer, Alerts, Personal Portfolio, and Token Pages.
* **Intel Exchange:** Decentralized marketplace to trade intel for ARKM.
* **AI Algorithm (Ultra):** Links blockchain addresses to real-world entities.

Some view Arkham's mission as controversial, as it challenges the anonymity principle of crypto. But its innovative approach and impressive backing, including support from OpenAI’s Sam Altman, make it a project worth watching.

TOP EARNING DIRECTIONS  'Retrodrops/Nodes/Testnets',retrodrops_airdrops,1ca0us1,2024-04-21 23:35:23,1,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrodrops_airdrops/comments/1ca0us1/top_earning_directions_retrodropsnodestestnets/,PrestigiousPush8589,,"It's not too late (and definitely not now) to make money in crypto, so I advise you not to procrastinate and choose a field to work in. That's where you'll pull in the money later.

If you're just starting your journey in crypto, it's advisable to check out the first publication and try to follow all the actions described there. It will greatly help you in understanding the information below.

I've prepared an activity for each direction that you can still jump into, so read quickly, choose, and start working on it 👇

🟠 Testnets.

Developers provide access to the test version of their project to identify errors. Mostly, testing testnets involves routine button clicking.

Costs — from $0. The lack of an entry threshold makes it highly unlikely that rewards will exceed the cost :)

▸ Recent successful cases include, for example, AltLayer. Where in just a couple of minutes, you could earn ~$300.

Recommend: Berachain — probably the most popular testnet at the moment!!! 

🟠 Nodes.

Here, you can also use the concept of testnets from the previous point, but it goes a little differently. Users need to run and ""maintain"" a node.

The entry threshold here is much higher — to run a node, you need to rent a server, the maintenance costs of which are at least $5 per month.

Usually, nodes are a long-term game, so you need to maintain server uptime for quite some time.

▸ However, the chance to earn is much higher than with regular testnets — for example, Celestia ($17,000+) or Dymension ($100,000).

If you're interested in the topic, we recommend starting to delve into it with our educational materials:

— Everything you need to know about nodes.
— How nodes ensure network security.
— Five steps to earning with nodes.

Recommend: Artela — a blockchain whose node you can set up by renting a server and using this guide. If you're not ready for such complexity yet, the project often conducts Galxe campaigns with simple tasks.

🟠 Retrodrops.

The essence is to work on already existing projects that don't have their own token, in the hope that after its launch, developers will distribute some of it to active users.

Why should they distribute? This way, they formally don't fall under the jurisdiction of regulators, which gives them more freedom of action.

Costs can be minimal or reach several hundred dollars:

▸ Arkham — a little over $100 in $ARKM tokens were given out for simple registration without expenses.

▸ Starknet — it took a minimum of $20 to work, but the project pleased with a generous drop of ~$2,000.

▸ Aevo — with an investment of $100, our subscribers were able to increase their balance by 7 times.

Recommend: Hyperlane — an inter-network messaging exchange protocol (like LayerZero). You just need to make inter-network transactions through IBC Fun or UseNexus. For example, we can exchange $USDC in Arbitrum for $ATOM in Cosmos Hub. "

Arkham (ARKM) Treasury Unlocks 25M Tokens Amid Price Slump! ,ArkhamAlliance,1bwd050,2024-04-05 04:37:44,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkhamAlliance/comments/1bwd050/arkham_arkm_treasury_unlocks_25m_tokens_amid/,Sharp-Crew4518,,"In the past 10 hours, the Arkham project's ecological fund and treasury have unlocked and transferred a staggering 25 million ARKM tokens, with 6 million (worth around $15M) being moved to Binance, as reported by on-chain analyst Ember.

This massive token movement comes at a time when the ARKM price is already suffering a significant decline, raising red flags for token holders and potential investors alike. The transfer of such a large quantity of tokens to a major exchange like Binance during a bear market suggests that key stakeholders may be preparing to offload their holdings, further driving down the price.

While there's a possibility that this unlock and transfer could be related to legitimate operational needs like funding development or fulfilling obligations, the lack of clear communication from the Arkham team leaves room for speculation and concern. If these tokens are sold on the open market, it will likely exacerbate the already bearish sentiment surrounding ARKM.

As an ARKM holder, I'm personally considering reducing my exposure until more clarity is provided about the rationale and implications of this move. The combination of a large treasury unlock, significant transfers to exchanges, and a declining token price is a concerning mix that warrants caution.

I'd advise fellow ARKM holders and potential investors to keep a close eye on official channels for any statements from the Arkham team addressing this situation. In the absence of a compelling justification, it may be prudent to limit your risk and wait for more favorable market conditions and project developments.

What are your thoughts on this ARKM treasury unlock and transfer? Do you think it's a bearish signal or could there be a reasonable explanation? Let me know in the comments below.

This is a quick guide on how to farm the VeloData airdrop. It's 100% and only requires an email address.

# What is Velo?

VeloData is a platform that allows users to access different features, such as cryptocurrency related statistics, and news.

[features](https://preview.redd.it/kronu94mxccc1.png?width=201&format=png&auto=webp&s=506851d26f2ca857cb5386b86ded3e44381abcdc)

[Data page](https://preview.redd.it/jkhzoc2lxccc1.png?width=1679&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ade79014b7a8bbf105c0541e0d4eec44c227119)

[News page](https://preview.redd.it/5l9id2krxccc1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa489ab385a73dd3c7b92cf71ba1aab1c57eb23)

# Why should you farm VeloData?

There is a chance VeloData will do an airdrop, which would be similar to the Arkham airdrop. For anyone wondering how much users made from that airdrop, you can check out this page on Dune: [https://dune.com/21co/arkham-intelligence-arkm](https://dune.com/21co/arkham-intelligence-arkm)

**TLDR:** the average user made **$234.50** in profits with the top earners making over **100k+** \- *Only from signing up with their email as far as I know! (Or multiple emails)*

# How to farm:

**Step 1:** 

Visit [https://velodata.app/](https://velodata.app/) and click on 'Open App'

[Velo main page](https://preview.redd.it/30xpg35i0dcc1.png?width=1707&format=png&auto=webp&s=402f65418b5c1683966871943f6f9be69bbc2d0d)

**Step 2:**

Sign up with your email.

[sign up](https://preview.redd.it/0yhwtzzg1dcc1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=1296473690bf6cd4406d668e8ef6327c3082e4d2)

They will send you an email with a code, and you can enter it on the next page to sign up

**Step 3 (optional):**

Now, if we think back on the Arkham airdrop: The top earners earned their stack by using multiple email addresses. By clicking on the profile at the top right corner of the screen, you can view your referral link.

[referral link popup](https://preview.redd.it/bzp5ujk12dcc1.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13710a0a35a0fc21ad275553184320550aaffbf)

If you have multiple email addresses, you can make accounts using your own referral link and sign up with those. Every referral gives you one point. As you can see here, I sent two referrals to myself and earned two points - No need to send your links to friends if you don't want to. I would use a VPN just in case though.

//

That's it for this guide. *Happy airdrop farming!*"

Poloniex Exploited for Over $120 Million

Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014, was exploited on November 10, 2023, for over $120 million in digital assets. The attack affected a number of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT.

Big Hits

According to Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain security firm, the exploit involved the hijacking of Poloniex's hot wallets. Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the internet and are used to store and process cryptocurrency transactions.

Arkham Intelligence has issued a bounty of 10,000 ARKM tokens for information leading to the identification of the hacker or the return of the stolen funds.

Poloniex has confirmed the exploit and has stated that it is working with law enforcement and blockchain security firms to investigate the matter. The exchange has also suspended all trading and withdrawals until the investigation is complete.

Latest Details

On November 12, 2023, Poloniex released a post-mortem report on the exploit. The report revealed that the attacker was able to gain access to Poloniex's hot wallets by exploiting a vulnerability in the exchange's infrastructure.

The report also stated that Poloniex is working to reimburse affected users and that it is taking steps to improve its security measures.
