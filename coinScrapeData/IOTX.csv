Bridging native Iotex to Ethereum issues,IoTeX,1bkd7wu,2024-03-21 14:12:21,5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IoTeX/comments/1bkd7wu/bridging_native_iotex_to_ethereum_issues/,almondbutter,,"Hello, I used the bridge to successfully swap a trial run of Native Iotex to ciotx. After I saw these appear in my MM, I assumed they were then able to be bridged to Ethereum. I sent a sample amount of ciotx to my Ethereum wallet and now they have seemed to disappear. I am trying to obtain erc 20 iotx to sell on coinbase. Any ideas where these ciotx landed? They are not showing on the Eth blockchain, and on IOTX blockchain, my wallet shows transactions of: contract interaction to obtain the ciotx, an approve ciotx spending cap, and a deposit to ... (my Eth address)

That last transaction I assumed would send to the ETH blockchain. Now those ciotx have disappeared. Any advice on how to obtain erc 20 iotx?

EDIT: I now have the contract address for ciotx on the Ethereum blockchain: 
https://etherscan.io/token/0x9F90B457Dea25eF802E38D470ddA7343691D8FE1

There it is in case this becomes handy for anyone."

The voting period has begun for IIP-21 If you're ready, [go vote.](https://gov.iotex.io/#/iotex.eth/proposal/0x3243e5577acb0b8b2f4d9728071d713b02a26b1c247dbbd727e0b3a1b9343659)

**Summary of the Proposal**

Should we approve and implement IIP-21 it will bridge the IOTX coin from the IoTeX network to Ethereum and create a new token called CIOTX (Crosschain IOTX) on Ethereum. The goal is to improve its utilization and demand in DeFi protocols and exchanges. Right now, the legacy ERC-20 version of IOTX, called IOTX-E, has limited supply and low circulating availability on Ethereum. That limits its usage and potential in DeFi protocols on Ethereum and some centralized exchanges. That's why we're proposing to introduce CIOTX on Ethereum via the ioTube bridge to enable its circulation on Ethereum.

CIOTX will be a wrapped IOTX on IoTeX network, which can be burnt and minted by ioTube bridge. CIOTX can be burnt on ioTube and minted on Ethereum, allowing its circulation on Ethereum. It will also be a standard ERC-20 token that can be used in any protocol on Ethereum, including popular DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Curve, Aave, and Compound. As such, it will be more useful.

Additionally, CIOTX can be paired with IOTX-E on DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, allowing users to swap between the two at a market price. Since CIOTX and IOTX-E may have different values based on demand, pairing them on DEXs will enable the market to determine their respective prices.

By implementing this proposal, IoTeX will have a more comprehensive ecosystem of IOTX-backed tokens that can be used across different blockchains, increasing their overall utility and value. Moreover, cryptocurrency exchanges that prefer to use ERC-20 tokens will now be able to list CIOTX on Ethereum. And CIOTX is fully backed by the native IOTX coin, making the listing process easy and simple.

Recapping, bridging IOTX to Ethereum and introducing CIOTX on Ethereum will improve its utilization and demand in DeFi protocols and exchanges, thus expanding the ecosystem of IOTX-backed tokens across different blockchains.

Borrowing USDC with ZRX: A Guide,fringefinanceapp,yv1jeg,2022-11-14 09:47:40,10,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fringefinanceapp/comments/yv1jeg/borrowing_usdc_with_zrx_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $ZRX as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $ZRX holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with 0x Protocol tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $ZRX (0x Token)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

**Here’s how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $ZRX current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 51% — depositing $1000 worth of $ZRX allows a user to borrow up to 510 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $ZRX increases in value. This means that any gains from your $ZRX position are entirely yours. If your $ZRX drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $ZRX plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is the 0x Protocol?

0x is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the Ethereum blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.

In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $wETH plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is Wrapped Ethereum?

$wETH is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Ether ($ETH). $wETH has a wider range of use cases than $ETH and is incredibly popular in the DeFi ecosystem. It’s also issued by a decentralized smart contract, so it does not have a centralized issuer like other wrapped tokens.

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum — you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $PAXG holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Pax Gold tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $ZRX (0x Token)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $PAXG (Pax Gold)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)

* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

**Here’s how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $PAXG current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 52% — depositing $1000 worth of $PAXG allows a user to borrow up to 520 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $PAXG increases in value. This means that any gains from your $PAXG position are entirely yours. If your $PAXG drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $PAXG plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is Paxos?

$PAXG is a gold-backed cryptocurrency, launched by the creators of Paxos Standard ($PAX) in September 2019. It is an ERC-20 token operating on the Ethereum blockchain.

The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $FXS current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 71% — depositing $1000 worth of $FXS allows a user to borrow up to 710 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $FXS increases in value. This means that any gains from your $FXS position are entirely yours. If your $FXS drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $FXS plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is FXS?

The Frax Protocol is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain — currently implemented on Ethereum. The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.

Now $KNC holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $KNC (Kyber Network’s Token)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $MANA (Decentraland)

* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $UNI (UniSwap)
* $DODO (Dodo)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto.

SAND is one of the top altcoins that can be used as collateral to get an instant loan on Fringe Finance. You can check other accepted altcoins on our [Primary Lending Platform](https://app.fringe.fi/), alongside the $USDC lending functionality that allows you to effortlessly earn interest on your $USDC."
Borrowing USDC with LDO: A Guide,fringefinanceapp,yv059t,2022-11-14 08:57:17,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fringefinanceapp/comments/yv059t/borrowing_usdc_with_ldo_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, a brand-new, inclusive DeFi lending platform, recently saw the integration of $LDO as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $LDO holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on how to borrow $USDC collateralizing LDO tokens.

### How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)

**Here’s how it works:** 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into a personal collateral safe. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. 

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $LDO’s current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 50% —depositing $1000 worth of $LDO allows a user to borrow up to 500 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $LDO increases in value. This means that any gains from your $LDO position are entirely yours. If your $LDO drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $LDO plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

When it comes to safety, Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view), meeting the highest standards of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before sending assets to a smart contract.

### What is Lido DAO?

[Lido](https://lido.fi/) is a staking solution for ETH, SOL, Kusama, and Polygon backed by industry-leading staking providers. Lido lets users stake their tokens without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure while participating in on-chain activities, e.g., lending.

This way, the project aims to solve the problems associated with initial ETH 2.0 staking —illiquidity, immovability, and accessibility. This makes staked tokens more liquid and usable across the growing DeFi ecosystems.

$LDO is an Ethereum-based token granting governance rights across the Lido DAO. The Lido DAO features a set of liquid staking protocols, decides on key parameters (e.g., fees), and executes protocol upgrades to ensure efficiency and stability.

With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $UMA holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with UMA tokens.

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $GTC (Gitcoin)
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $UMA current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 50% — depositing $1000 worth of $UMA allows a user to borrow up to 500 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $UMA increases in value. This means that any gains from your $UMA position are entirely yours. If your $UMA drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $UMA plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is Wrapped Ethereum?

$wETH is an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Ether ($ETH). $wETH has a wider range of use cases than $ETH and is incredibly popular in the DeFi ecosystem. It’s also issued by a decentralized smart contract, so it does not have a centralized issuer like other wrapped tokens.

Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting, and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum — you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $LON holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Tokenlon Network tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $OCEAN (Ocean Protocol)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $ZRX (0x Token)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $PAXG (Pax Gold)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LON (Tokenlon Network Tokens)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $LON current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 53% — depositing $1000 worth of $LON allows a user to borrow up to 530 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $LON increases in value. This means that any gains from your $LON position are entirely yours. If your $LON drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $LON plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

Borrowing USDC with FXS: A Guide,FraxShare,xi69en,2022-09-19 04:40:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FraxShare/comments/xi69en/borrowing_usdc_with_fxs_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $FXS as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $FXS holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Frax tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $SAND (The Sandbox Token)
* $FXS (Frax Share)
* $UNI (Uniswap)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $DODO (DODO)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX Token**)**
* $KNC (Kyber Network)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $FTX (FTX Token)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $FXS current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 71% — depositing $1000 worth of $FXS allows a user to borrow up to 710 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $FXS increases in value. This means that any gains from your $FXS position are entirely yours. If your $FXS drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $FXS plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is FXS?

The Frax Protocol is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain — currently implemented on Ethereum. The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.

Borrowing USDC with MANA: A Guide,ManaTrader,wktrao,2022-08-10 06:18:01,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManaTrader/comments/wktrao/borrowing_usdc_with_mana_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $MANA as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $MANA holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens.

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with Decentraland tokens.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $MANA (Decentraland)
* $FOX (Shapeshift FOX)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)
* $SAND (Sandbox)

Here’s how it works:

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets into a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $MANA current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 45% — depositing $1000 worth of $MANA allows a user to borrow up to 450 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $MANA increases in value. This means that any gains from your $MANA position are entirely yours. If your $MANA drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $MANA plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is MANA?

[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) is a 3D virtual world browser-based platform. Users may buy virtual plots of land on the platform as NFTs via the MANA cryptocurrency, which uses the Ethereum blockchain. It was opened to the public in February 2020 and is overseen by the nonprofit Decentraland Foundation.

Shapeshift works as a DEX aggregator, selecting the DEX route that costs the least to the user. Its platform also features an interface to access and control DeFi investments, and integration with fiat on-ramps such as JunoPay, Banxa, and GEM.

Shapeshift also runs [CoinCap.io](http://coincap.io/), a cryptocurrency market data platform, and KeepKey, a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. $FOX is ShapeShift’s governance token, controlling the ShapeShift DAO and offering liquidity farming opportunities.

FOX is one of the top altcoins that can be used as collateral to get an instant loan on Fringe Finance. You can check other accepted altcoins on our [Primary Lending Platform](https://app.fringe.fi/), alongside the $USDC lending functionality that allows you to effortlessly earn interest on your $USDC."
Borrowing USDC with APE: A Guide,apecoins,w4aets,2022-07-21 03:31:33,25,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/apecoins/comments/w4aets/borrowing_usdc_with_ape_a_guide/,crypto-konstantin,,"Fringe Finance, an all-new and inclusive DeFi lending platform, saw the integration of $APE as a collateral type into its Primary Lending Platform (PLP). With Fringe’s PLP, borrowers can take out $USDC loans against their altcoins. Now $APE holders will get access to stablecoin loans and will be able to unlock part of the value of their positions without selling their tokens. 

Below, we’ve prepared a short tutorial on borrowing $USDC with ApeCoin.

## How do $USDC Loans work?

Through Fringe Finance, you can take out instant $USDC overcollateralized loans against:

* $MATIC (Polygon)
* $LINK (Chainlink)
* $TOMOE (ERC-20 $TOMO) (Tomochain)
* $REN (Ren Protocol)
* $IOTX (IoTeX)
* $BNT (Bancor)
* $OGN (Origin Protocol)
* $LDO (Lido Finance)
* $SHIB (Shiba Inu)
* $APE (Ape Coin)

Here’s how it works: 

On the Primary Lending Platform, you can deposit altcoins into your personal collateral safes. Your wallet is the only key to moving the assets on your collateral safes. You, and only you, maintain full control of your assets throughout the duration of your loans. Fringe’s PLP has been doubly audited by [HashEx](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf) and [CyberUnit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LS7Xmxpgs2ontY0RSvpsLwyRZ20ypK26/view); thus, it has the highest standard of security in crypto. Still, we encourage users to always do their own research before dropping assets to a smart contract.

Once assets have been deposited into the platform, you may take out loans against your holdings. The amount a user can borrow depends on the total value deposited in the collateral safe, the asset’s maximum borrowing capacity, and the asset’s loan-to-value ratio (LVR). $APE current LVR in Fringe’s PLP is 60% — depositing $1000 worth of $APE allows a user to borrow up to 600 $USDC.

Outstanding loans accrue interest continually. This interest, however, does not increase proportionally as your $APE increases in value. This means that any gains from your $APE position are entirely yours. If your $APE drastically depreciates, your position may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation. In other words, the platform will be allowed to sell an equivalent amount of your deposited $APE plus a liquidation fee to settle your loan.

## What is APE?

[$APE](https://apecoin.com/) is a token made to support the BAYC ecosystem, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.

ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing a globally dispersed community — and, therefore, essential to the success of the $APE ecosystem.

Why buy IoTeX (IOTX)?,u_ZebPayMarketing,u1wo94,2022-04-12 07:19:05,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ZebPayMarketing/comments/u1wo94/why_buy_iotex_iotx/,ZebPayMarketing,,"The native ERC-20 token of the IoTeX platform is called [IOTX](https://zebpay.com/in/buy-iotx/).

IOTX is used to fuel the workings of the IoTeX blockchain and is also IoTeX market. Not just that, it is used to connect internet of things devices to IoTeX network."
Questions and thoughts on IOPAY wallet and IOTEX,IoTeX,s5wm5n,2022-01-17 01:00:17,9,0.92,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IoTeX/comments/s5wm5n/questions_and_thoughts_on_iopay_wallet_and_iotex/,Virtual_Ad7915,,"I'm relatively new to crypto after dabbling first on Coinbase and on a learning curve/journey into crypto projects that have a raison d'etre that I can get behind.  So far I'm long on ATOM and ANATHA and would like to go long on IOTEX.  I think (as most of us here would) that it has pretty much unlimited upside.

But the user experience - if you're not deeply into crypto jargon, processes, concepts etc. - is a barrier to greater levels of adoption.  If this project is to flourish it has to cater for the greater part of the population that is not-crypto literate.  We are moving from innovators -> early adopters -> early majority.  The early majority will only have a basic familiarity with crypto concepts - and projects will flourish only when the user interface becomes intuitive.

I have a mobile and desktop wallet.  Nowhere can I find a mechanism to create a twelve word seed phrase.  I would really appreciate any guidance here.  Did I miss a step in the sequence?  Is it too late to get one for the wallet?  Should I create a new wallet and transfer my balances over?  One problem for me is I can't seem to set up my desktop wallet to reflect my account that is in the mobile app.  I don't have that problem with wallets that have seed phrases.

I bought IoTeX (ERC-20) on Coinbase.  I bought a UCam (still unboxed).  I read posts on how to get IoTex (ERC 20) into the IOPAY wallet - that left me confused.  I created a MetaMask wallet.  I transferred some IoTex (ERC-20) into my Metmask wallet.  Success!  Joy!

I then tried to follow the ioTube instructions with a small amount of tokens.  First issue - must be no less than 100 tokens.  Not ideal for a trial but - okay, I increased the amount.  Then there were a (to me) complicated sequence of events.  First - gas fees.  That would have been nice if that was explicit in the instructions.  30 minutes later I have $50 of Eth in the Metmask wallet.  I tried to enter the IOPAY wallet address but the message informed me that the key had to have 64 characters.  I must have been doing something wrong. After 30 minutes of trying things I managed to connect IOPAY to Iotube.  I don't know how I connected now as I did not record all my steps.

Then I attempted a transfer.  I can't remember the exact sequence but something like , put in the details, confirm the transfer and then some messages indicating it would take x amounts of validators to confirm the transactions. Then a message saying 'Convert?'.  I didn't know what to do so I confirmed.  Then messages indicating insufficient ETH.  At this point I bought more ETH and sent to Metamask.  Then messages saying transaction failed.  I sent more ETH and tried again.  ETH was spent.  More messages saying transaction failed.

At this point I have thoughts like - this is all too hard.  Should I leave this project?  I don't want to because I like what this project is doing.  But I don't like failing the process stuff and I don't like losing or throwing my crypto away.

A short while later my wallet indicates I have 100 WIOTX = $0.  What do I do with this?    

I would appreciate any guidance, especially on the Iotube process.  Step by step in the sequence that they appear in the process.  Apologies in advance for any rookie errors or my mental thickness.

Finally - I would like to have the process stuff sorted and my wallet with a seed phrase before I connect up my Ucam.  I'm guessing once that's attached to my IOTX address it won't be transferable to another account.  If you've read this fat - thanks for your patience and understanding."

IOTEX Forum Info Regarding ERC-20 and Native,IoTeX,r4v5yf,2021-11-29 07:50:50,4,0.75,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IoTeX/comments/r4v5yf/iotex_forum_info_regarding_erc20_and_native/,Itz_Dash,,"Here is some info I found from IOTEX support regarding lost tokens as well as why the ERC-20 was listed on Coinbase to begin with. Seems it was in fact an oversight by Coinbase and should not have been listed. See below from IOTEX Support:

Hello to all,

Please Be Advised: Don’t send native IOTX to Coinbase from ioPay: Coinbase only accepts ERC20 IOTX tokens (on the Ethereum network).

IoTeX runs its own blockchain, where native IOTX tokens are live. But they also exist IOTX tokens on Ethereum (ERC-20) as well as on other blockchains. Coinbase trades ERC-20 IOTX tokens, so you can only withdraw those tokens to the Ethereum blockchain, and you need a wallet connected to the Ethereum chain to see those tokens, while ioPay is connected to the ioTeX chain. This is an issue that arises due to Coinbase unexpectedly listing the IOTX Erc20 token on Ethereum. That token was almost entirely burned during mainnet release (they should have listed the native IOTX, or at least a cross-chain Erc20 token of IOTX, CIOTX), and eventually they ended up in an isolated market that absorbed all the IOTX-E in circulation, and the price raised as a consequence (though nobody can actually go there and sell). The IoTeX tokens that are owned by Crypto.com and run on the IoTeX Native Blockchain."
Where Are My Funds?,IoTeX,r0y0bb,2021-11-24 01:00:47,4,0.83,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IoTeX/comments/r0y0bb/where_are_my_funds/,7shi,,"I just sent ERC-20 IOTEX to my IOTX wallet from coinbase using web 3.0 deposit and the transaction is complete but I do not see the funds on my wallet. I did this on my iphone btw

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Thanks to the peeps in the comments, I was able to resolve this issue. Here are the steps I took:

First understand that I got stuck in this dilemma by depositing the ERC-20 IOTX token (IOTX-E) using my web3 public address on the ioPay app from coinbase.

1. I went to my Metamask on my desktop pc and switched to the IOTX network.
2. Then, I imported my ioPay account into Metamask by copying my ioPay private key into the import account option in Metamask.
3. I then switched to the Etherium network and imported the IOTX-E token.
4. Next, I went to [iotube.org](https://iotube.org) and connected my Metamask wallet.
5. I looked in the dropdown menu for the IOTX-E token.
6. I sent all the IOTX-E I had to the IOTX network. It took a good minute for that to complete. And the ETH gas fees were high.
7. After that transaction finished I went back to the ioPay mobile app and went to settings --> XRC20 Tokens and then tapped WIOTX. The WIOTX then displayed in my wallet.
8. Next, using the ioPay app I tapped discover, then more, and then opened mimo.
9. I connected my ioPay wallet to mimo and switched my WIOTX to IOTX.
10. Done."

&#x200B;

Apparently, everyone went on converting native IoTeX to Erc-20 to sell on Coinbase. that's paused for now as erc20 liquidity on Iotube went sharply down. However, owners can only swap from ERC-20 to native IoTeX (@ People who bought on coinbase and want to transfer to IoPay.)"

I'm trying to move some IOTX to my android wallet in order to stake. But the deposit fails. It seems there has to be a minimum amount of IOTX in a wallet for it to be active?? How do I go about depositing existing IOTX to my wallet? Or should I just use the web wallet? Thank you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: OK, there is some difference between ERC20 addresses and native addresses. The adress I'm trying to send from starts with 0x... and the ""native"" wallets I've created all over the place start with io.... I can't tell which one is the native token which is needed to stake and vote.. Help!

&#x200B;

OK, after a bit more reading, I've connected my Metamask account with [https://member.iotex.io/tools/iotex](https://member.iotex.io/tools/iotex) and it can read my ETH address, and gave me a new io.. address. So, from my account with the IOTX address that also starts with 0x... I guess I send that to the ETH address, and not an IOTEX address, correct? And the site [https://member.iotex.io/tools/iotex](https://member.iotex.io/tools/iotex) will convert the IOTX ERC-20 tokens into native io.. addressed tokens, correct??"

\-  **IoTeX Foundation Grants:** formal program for blockchain & IoT developers and ecosystem builders 

\-  **Native IOTX Only:** complete migration from IOTX-E (ERC20) to Native IOTX ; currently it is ahybrid system and both ERC-20 and Native IOTX function within the ecosystem.

\-  **Scalable Staking:** new transaction-based staking rather than smart contract-based

**Little-Known Asian Crypto Exchange VinDAX Got Hacked, Lost ‘Half A Million USD’ Worth Of Tokens**  
Vietnam-based little-known cryptocurrency exchange VinDAX has been hacked, losing “half a million USD” worth of cryptocurrencies, The Block has learned. An admin of VinDAX’s official Telegram channel, with the handle “[@VinDAXSupport](http://twitter.com/VinDAXSupport)” confirmed to The Block on Nov. 8 that it is “true” that the exchange got hacked and lost cryptocurrencies worth the amount. They said the breach took place “3 days ago.”

He also told a news conference in Brussels that he backed proposals from Germany’s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz to link progress on an Europe-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme to banks’ reduction of their exposure to sovereign debt.

**Blockchain White Paper (2019): China’s Application For Blockchain Patents Ranks First In The World**  
According to CCTV news, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) released the Blockchain White Paper (2019) in Beijing today, Nov 8. Citing statistics from the white paper, the number of applications for blockchain patents is currently over 18,000 across the globe, and China holds more than half of the total, ranking the first in the world. At present, 38% of blockchain enterprises are concentrated in cryptocurrency, and 23% of blockchain enterprises focus on the research and development of blockchain technology. The US, China and the UK are three countries that own most blockchain companies in the world.

**Former PBoC Govenor: China’s Central Bank-Backed Digital Currency Will Focus On Domestic Market**  
In a recent summit held in Beijing, former PBoC (People’s Bank of China) governor ZHOU Xiaochuan appeared and made comments. Here are the main points of him:  
1.In a reply to the question “Whether PBoC launched a timetable for the release of digital currencies,” ZHOU said some mints once said a potential substitution of paper money can be digital currencies five years ago, but they didn’t discuss the possibility of applying blockchain or distributed ledgers in details;  
2.Third-party payment plays an important role in China’s payment industry, which grows towards the e-payment, and develops rapidly. Blockchain and distributed ledgers are still in an early stage in China. And he also believes digital currency has not been employed widely by global countries with Libra breaking forth nothing but a concept;  
3.ZHOU revealed that PBoC once brought in some seminars to introduce blockchain and distributed ledgers. Considering blockchain and distributed ledgers are more suitable for small transactions, PBoC chose two systems — bill business and trade financing to do trials;  
4.People still have many doubts about the hosting of Libra such as how to confirm the amount of the reserve fund, whether a private Libra Association lacks public transparency, and whether this Association aims to profit form interests;  
5.PBoC’s digital currency will focus on domestic China, especially in such areas as wholesale between the banking industry and the third-party payment industry. Theoretically, it can provide services to retails but potentially at the expense of exposing China’s financial industry to great shocks. So, the organization is very cautious about this. A united mechanism may be needed if PBoC is to provide cross-border remittance or investment with such technologies.

In the past few hours, there was a steady decline in bitcoin from the $9,440 high against the US Dollar. The last swing high was near $9,374 before the price declined below the $9,300 support area.

Moreover, there was a close below the $9,300 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price spiked below the $9,120 support area and traded as low as $9,084.

It is currently correcting higher above the $9,120 level. Additionally, it surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,374 high to $9,084 low.

However, the price is facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the $9,240 and $9,300 levels. More importantly, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,240 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

In the past three sessions, there was a steady decline in bitcoin below the $9,400 pivot level against the US Dollar. BTC is facing an increase in selling interest below $9,375, but it is still holding the 100 hourly simple moving average.

The last swing high was near $9,440 before the price declined towards the $9,200 support area. The recent low was $9,257 and the price is currently consolidating losses.

An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $9,350-$9,360 area. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $9,440 high to $9,257 low.

Moreover, there is a key contracting triangle pattern forming with resistance near $9,360 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, an upside break above the $9,360 and $9,400 resistance levels could set the pace for more gains in the near term.

**BTC —** BTC rose rapidly in the early hours of this morning, reaching a maximum of $9645, now falling back to around $9400. In the past 24 hours, the net outflow of BTC funds is close to US $50 million, and the outflow of market funds is significantly increased compared with the previous cycle. BTC made a tentative pull in the early morning to test the upper resistance. In terms of the 4-hour line, the overall volume is not obvious, and the follow-up strength is insufficient, and the breakthrough is not successful. The domestic market is still dominated by shocks, and may withdraw again after the failure of short-term breakthrough to prepare for the next round of offensive. The upper resistance continued to focus around $9600, while the lower support continued to focus on $9000. In terms of operation, it is suggested to control the position and wait for the right opportunity to build the position.

**China And Kazakhstan To Cooperate In Digital Industry, And Blockchain**HAN Zheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chinese chair of the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee, and Alikhan Smailov, first Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan and the Kazakh Chair of the committee, co-chaired the ninth meeting of the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee in China on November 4.

**Huawei To Advance Commercial Application Of Blockchain, Says Director Of Huawei Blockchain Project**Recently, blockchain has been a quite hot word in China after President XI Jinping claimed the emerging technology is vital to the future of the country. ZHANG Xiaojun, the director of the Huawei blockchain project, shared his opinions on the current development of blockchain in a recent interview.When talking about the obstacles faced by the blockchain in terms of the wide application, ZHANG pointed out four points. Firstly, users hope to increase revenue through blockchain, while the technology itself is to reduce operating cost; secondly, the security of blockchain technology is still insufficient, which may lead to new security risks in the application; thirdly, the shortage of cross-chain standards brings difficulties in the large commercial application of blockchain; lastly, blockchain is becoming an isolated island, which makes POC possible but blocks it to be commercialized.What Huawei faces is the first obstacle, according to ZHANG. He said the company intends to provide customers with a clear value demonstration for blockchain, which will help sweep aside customers’ concerns and enlarge their commercial application layout.Besides, regarding opportunities brought by 5G to blockchain, he stated that the blockchain technology would not only be deployed in the core cloud but also the edge cloud. And 5G can meet demands of large bandwidth and low latency for the edge cloud blockchain in the case of large commercial use.

**China Launches A Blockchain-Based Identification System For Smart Cities**China has launched a blockchain-based identification system for smart cities, aimed at better connectivity and data sharing between these cities.The system has been developed by three institutes in the city of Shijiazhuang and will assign a unique, global digital ID to nationwide smart cities, Global Times reported on Nov. 4, citing state-run Xinhua News Agency.ZHANG Chao, director of the Zhongguancun Industry & Information Research Institute of Two-dimensional Code Technology, one of the developers of the blockchain-based ID system, said that the system was self-developed by China and will be “independently distributed and managed by China, with a unified distribution rule, a resolution of distributed storage and tamper-resistant code.”

**DAppTotal: Airdrop Of EIDOS Is A Disaster, Top Player May Profit Over Tens Of Thousands Of Dollars**  
Citing data by DAppTotal, ever since EIDOS launched the airdrop event, the number of its 24h active users has reached 1,260, that of its 24h transactions has surpassed 1.89 million, and its 24h trading volume has registered 1,770 EOS. Such popularity has never been seen in any other EOS DApps, according to DAppTotal.  
Blockchain security firm PeckShield revealed that the airdrop event of EIDOS led to the price surge of CPU, which means normal EOS transactions between users could fail and most of the users are not able to play with gaming DApps under a congested EOS network.  
As reported by CoinNess.com earlier, the current CPU price for 1 EOS is 0.0001 EOS. Two days ago, however, one could use 1 EOS to rent 3,600 EOS for 30 days. This indicates an increase of more than 16 times because of the EIDOS hype.  
DAppTotal researchers found that as of now, players have made 35.83 million transactions, containing 3.39 million EIDOS tokens, to the account ‘eidosonecoin,’ 95% of which had only 0.0001 EOS sent. If a user sold all of the EIDOS tokens at peak prices, his or her earnings could be more than tens of thousands of dollars.  
It is really harmful to the EOS ecosystem, said the researchers.

**At Least 23k Emails Leaked By BitMEX, Claims Research Director At The Block**  
Larry Cermak, Director of Research at The Block, tweeted, “I now have access to 23,000 emails that were leaked by BitMEX. Surprisingly, there is only one person that used a .gov email. There were 66 students/alumni that used .edu email. NYU dominates (7 people), followed by Berkley, and University of Michigan.”  
BitMEX has previously made a response to the leaked email address in its blog post, saying that in this instance, beyond email addresses, no other personal data or account information has been disclosed and no further emails have been sent.  
“The error which has caused this has been identified and fixed, ensuring our usual high standards of privacy are upheld,” the company claimed.

**Chinese VC Firms Returning To Blockchain, $368M Raised In H1, 2019 By Blockchain Startups**  
Chinese venture capital firms are taking another look at blockchain. After the 2018 crypto crash, up to 90 percent of blockchain-focused VCs left the market. Now, as China’s central government pushes for greater blockchain adoption, some are returning.  
During the first six months in 2019, Chinese blockchain startups raised $368 million via 71 funding deals, according to Chinese financial data tracker 01Caijing.

This past week, there was a slow and steady decline in bitcoin below the $8,400 support against the US Dollar. Moreover, BTC price also traded below the $8,200 support area. Finally, it spiked below the $8,000 support, but remained well above the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).

A swing low was formed near $8,960 and the price recently started an upward move. There was a break above the $8,100 and $8,200 resistance levels to start a decent increase.

More importantly, there was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance near $9,240 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. At the moment, the price is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $10,584 high to $8,960 low.

**Crypto Custody Firm Xapo Initiated 5 Whale Transfers On Nov 1**  
Citing data from the Bejijing-based blockchain security company Chainsguard, the Bitcoin network witnessed multiple whale transfers on Nov 1. At 21:10:38 UTC on Nov 1, Xapo, a Bitcoin custody service provider, has conducted five whale transfers with the largest amount within one transfer marking up to 20,000 BTC. The total number of moved BTC in these transfers records 65822.01. Many of these BTC originated from the transfers of 4,999 to 10,000 BTC collected by Xapo on the Bitcoin chain at 19:19:49 and 19:32:12 on the same day. One of the main BTC sources initiated by the address starting with 37whD5 was crypto exchange Bitstamp.  
Previously, the above-mentioned exchange announced that its custodian would change to BitGo. Otherwise, Bitstamp had a great transfer with more than 110,000 BTC involved on October 15. At 20:53:20 on Nov 1, the wallet address beginning with 3AdpZc initiated a transfer of 5000 BTC to the exchange Poloniex. After analysis, the source can be traced back to the coins accumulated by Poloniex in March 2016.  
Generally speaking, the whale transfer carried out by institutions comes from the needs of business or customers. Sometimes, it is only the planned wallet management.

**Utah To Facilitate Voting For Disabled Individuals Through Blockchains**  
Recent reports indicate that blockchain technology will soon be used in Utah, as part of a trial project meant to allow disabled individuals to cast their votes. To put things into perspective, the local council and government of Utah have decided to allow blockchain-based voting via smartphones in the upcoming municipal election that will take place in November. The platform that disabled voters will be using for this election represents the result of a fruitful partnership between the Utah Country Elections Division, the National Cybersecurity Centre, Tusk Philanthropies and Voatz, a local voting app development company.

**Ethereum To Increase The Blocksize By 8x**  
Ethereum is partially addressing the many complexities of sharding by simply increasing the blocksize from the equivalent of about 1MB every ten minutes to circa 8MB.  
Danny Ryan, the Ethereum 2.0 coordinator, publicly said: “We are making the blocks bigger based on recent research on safe block size and propagation times, so the data availability of the system is still > 1MB/s so you can still get similar scalability gains when doing things like ZKrollup and OVM.”  
ZK rollups are a hybrid scaling method that combines on-chain security and second layer networks through smart contracts and zero knowledge methods. OVM is the Optimistic Virtual Machine from Plasma, with both being more sort of on top of Ethereum’s public blockchain.

During the first quarter of the year, Bitcoin was trapped inside a tight trading range, where major players began buying the fear of retail crypto investors and accumulating the asset at the lowest possible prices.

Starting in the second quarter, the first-ever crypto asset rocketed up from that trading range, and went on a parabolic rally that didn’t stop until Bitcoin met former bear market resistance at $14,000 where it was rejected.

After three consecutive red monthly candles in a row, October closed green and kept a potential bull flag formation on monthly price charts intact, giving bulls hope that the crypto asset’s 2019 rally isn’t totally finished.

**BTC —** BTC has continued to maintain range volatility since yesterday and is still hovering around $9200. In the past 24 hours, the net outflow of BTC capital has exceeded US $30 million, and the outflow of market capital has decreased significantly compared with the previous period. Yesterday, BTC fluctuated a lot. In the afternoon, it pretended to fall below the $9000 level and quickly rebounded to the highest around $9467. Then it rebounded slightly after stepping back on the $9000 support twice in the morning. At present, the short-term market is still in the stage of interval fluctuation, and frequent operation here may be more difficult. It is recommended to take the medium and long-term line as the investment target. The upper resistance level is close to $9600, while the lower resistance level is close to $9000. In terms of operation, it is suggested to control the position for the time being. The risk of further write back cannot be excluded here.

**Belgian Finance Watchdog Ups List Of Suspected Crypto Scams To 131**Belgium’s financial sector regulator has issued a fresh warning over suspected cryptocurrency scam websites, bringing its running list to 131 domains. It noted that the anatomy of such frauds continues to be the same, with scammers promising riches in easy steps, regardless of prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies. But, it warned, “In the end, the result is always the same: the victims find themselves unable to recover their money!”

**Malta Financial Services Authority prompts Bitcoin Future to be at risk of fraud**The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has recognized an entity called Bitcoin Future. The entity appears to exhibit the same deceptive characteristics as another entity, Bitcoin Revolution. The MFSA had previously issued a public warning on January 25, 2019 and August 29, 2019 at Bitcoin Revolution. Bitcoin Future is not a registered company in Malta, nor is it an entity operating under the provisional provisions of Section 62 of the Virtual Financial Assets Act, nor is it authorized to provide any financial services in Malta. In addition, the information obtained by the MFSA indicates that Bitcoin Future may be an international “fast get rich” cryptocurrency scam. Therefore, the public should avoid any business or transaction with an entity operating under the above name.

**Fortex Expands Crypto Offering With NDFs**Fortex Technologies, an institutional foreign exchange (FX) trading solutions provider, on Thursday (Oct 31) announced an expansion of its crypto services with the launch of crypto non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) and an institution-focused platform. With the institutional-grade platform, the company will provide an array of services including an end-to-end solution facilitating price discovery, liquidity aggregation, OEMS, risk management, white-label, and price distribution.

Recently, there were mostly range moves above the $9,000 support area against the US Dollar. BTC corrected lower below the $9,150 level and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average.

The recent low was formed near the $9,013 and the price is currently holding the $9,000 support area. It is climbing higher and trading above the $9,100 level. Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,534 high to $9,013 low.

However, the price seems to be facing resistance near $9,200 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Additionally, this week’s followed major bearish trend line is active with resistance near $9,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

**BiShiJie Research Released Report On Decentralized Finance 2019**  
BiShiJie Research today on Oct 30 released a report on decentralized finance (DeFi) 2019 in partnership with DApp Total at the #Global Blockchain DeFi Summit# held by BiShiJie and CoinNess.  
Per the report, the value of the overall locked DeFi assets has surpassed $1 billion this year. As of the end of Q3, DeFi DApps had become the most active products on the Ethereum blockchain, with more than 132,000 users. Noticeably, 58% of Ethereum’s on-chain trading volume, around $466 million, came from DeFi DApps.

Bitcoin price is currently correcting lower and is trading below $9,500 against the US Dollar. The price is likely to decline further towards $8,700 before it could rise again. Yesterday’s highlighted key bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $9,460 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The price must surpass the $9,460 and $9,500 resistance levels to start a fresh increase. 

  
Bitcoin price is facing a few key hurdles near $9,500 against the US Dollar. Therefore, BTC could dip a few points before a fresh increase in the near term.

On Sunday (October 27), the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina introduced new rules of capital control which allow us to suggest that the government believes in Bitcoin and prefers cryptos to fiat money. Argentina’s central bank has rapidly cut down the amount of US dollars citizens can purchase. Previously, savers could purchase no more than $10,000 per month. Now, this amount is reduced to $200 only. This limitation decreases the US dollar purchasing power by 98%.

Recently, bitcoin price climbed towards the $10,000 resistance area against the US Dollar. However, BTC failed to continue higher and formed a high near the $9,935 level.

Later, there was a fresh decline below the $9,600 and $9,500 support levels. The price traded close to the $9,100 support area and remained well bid above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent low was near $9,194 and the price is currently climbing steadily.

There was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,935 high to $9,194 swing low. At the outset, bitcoin is testing the $9,500 and $9,550 resistance levels. Additionally, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,560 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

More importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,935 high to $9,194 swing low is acting as a hurdle for the bulls. Therefore, an upside break above the $9,550 and $9,600 levels is needed for a fresh increase.

This past week, there was a sharp rally in bitcoin above the $7,500 and $8,000 resistances against the US Dollar. BTC even surged above the $9,500 and $10,000 levels before correcting lower.

Later, the price corrected below the $9,500 support and the $9,000 pivot zone. However, the decline was contained below $9,000 and the price remained well above the 100 hourly simple moving average.

A low was formed near $8,896 and bitcoin started a fresh increase. It broke the $9,000 and $9,200 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward correction from the $10,578 high to $8,896 low.

However, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near $9,850 and $9,900. Besides, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward correction from the $10,578 high to $8,896 low prevented any further upsides.

Xin chào cộng đồng IoTeX! Kể từ khi phát hành mã Testnet Alpha của chúng tôi vào tháng 6, nhóm IoTeX đã làm việc suốt ngày đêm về phát triển kỹ thuật, quan hệ đối tác chiến lược và cộng đồng. Vào tháng 8, chúng tôi đã chính thức ra mắt Chương trình và trang web Đối tác IoTeX và công bố bảy đối tác chiến lược tuyệt vời cho đến nay. Chúng tôi cũng đã đưa các kỹ sư hàng đầu mới tham gia nhóm của chúng tôi và có niềm vui chia sẻ tầm nhìn của IoTeX tại các hội nghị và cuộc họp trên toàn thế giới. Quan trọng nhất, chúng tôi đã đạt được tiến bộ lớn về phát triển kỹ thuật của chúng tôi. Hôm nay, chúng tôi rất vui mừng ra mắt bản phát hành mã thứ ba của mình: **Testnet Beta - Epik!**

**Bạn có thể thấy mã nguồn mở trên Github của chúng tôi ngay bây giờ:**

[**https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/releases/tag/v0.3.0**](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

&#x200B;

Hướng dẫn chi tiết để chạy mã Epik được cung cấp trong [**tệp README**](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/blob/v0.3.0/README.md) này và video demo chi tiết cũng có thể được tìm thấy [**ở đây**](https://youtu.be/10BXKdpofWs) .

**Tại sao lại có tên Epik?**

Epik được đặt theo tên của [Rob C. Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike) , một lập trình viên và tác giả người Canada, người đã góp phần tạo ra các ngôn ngữ lập trình Go (Golang), Limbo và Sawzall. Như bạn có thể đã nhận thấy, Epik là một hoán vị của Pike, theo xu hướng đặt tên cho mỗi bản phát hành mã IoTeX theo một trong những thần tượng công nghệ của chúng tôi.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utonu9uqcl621.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=33adfcd64dc494941955d144ee21e6f3fc7a4b54

Pike nổi tiếng với sự đóng góp của ông cho các ngôn ngữ lập trình, thiết bị đầu cuối đồ họa, bằng sáng chế, nhiều trình soạn thảo văn bản, v.v. Chuỗi khối IoTeX được mã hóa bằng Golang, do Pike đồng sáng tạo, do dễ triển khai, các tính năng đồng thời, tập trung vào khả năng mở rộng và hơn thế nữa. Mã hóa bản phát hành này Epik là một sự tôn vinh cho những đổi mới của Pike, nơi cung cấp các khối xây dựng cho IoTeX và các nhà phát triển trên toàn thế giới để đổi mới ngày nay.

## 

**Tổng quan & Tính năng của Epik**

Trong bản phát hành mã thứ hai của chúng tôi, Testnet Alpha (tên mã là Strive Strive), chúng tôi đã giới thiệu một số cải tiến nội bộ thể hiện các quyết định thiết kế trả trước của IoTeX cùng nhau. Strive đã đặt kế hoạch chi tiết ban đầu cho tầm nhìn của IoTeX để tạo ra một blockchain riêng tư, có thể mở rộng và có thể tương tác, mà không làm giảm tính bảo mật hoặc hiệu suất. Cùng với việc phát hành mã, chúng tôi cũng đã chứng minh mã được chạy trên nhiều thiết bị IoT nhẹ. Để biết thêm chi tiết về phiên bản trước của chúng tôi, vui lòng xem [**bài đăng trên blog**](https://medium.com/iotex/iotex-testnet-alpha-strive-release-fbd83718f614) và [**video giới thiệu**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAw7_H71o7s) Strive của chúng tôi .

Trong hai tháng qua, chúng tôi đã tăng cường đáng kể cơ sở mã hiện có và cũng đã phát triển một số tính năng mới, thú vị cho **Epik** , tập trung vào việc mang lại *tính khả dụng* và *hữu hình* cho IoTeX Testnet. Một số tính năng chính của Epik bao gồm:

* Hỗ trợ máy ảo Ethereum (EVM) và hợp đồng thông minh
* Triển khai ví IoTeX
* Cải tiến đồng thuận và cải tiến mô phỏng
* Chữ ký BLS và triển khai DKG (Tạo khóa kép)
* Nâng cấp bảo quản công việc
* Hỗ trợ hơn 100 nút phân phối vật lý

Ngoài việc thêm các tính năng mới, chúng tôi cũng đã thực hiện nhiều đánh giá mã (ví dụ, tuần chất lượng của Wap) tập trung vào việc nâng cao hiệu suất và tính ổn định của cơ sở mã hiện có. Trong số các lợi ích khác, các đánh giá mã này đã giúp cải thiện hiệu suất cơ sở dữ liệu lên \~ 10 lần và cho phép chúng tôi hỗ trợ nhất quán hơn 100 giao dịch được hoàn thành ngay lập tức mỗi giây (IFTPS) trên Testnet của chúng tôi. Bảng dưới đây cung cấp tổng quan về các cải tiến hiệu suất và các tính năng mới của Epik:

**Epik: Một Testnet hữu hình và có thể sử dụng**

Trong ngành công nghiệp blockchain ngày nay, nhiều dự án phát hành Testnets không mang đến cơ hội cho người dùng, đặc biệt là người dùng không có kỹ thuật, tương tác trực tiếp với môi trường Testnet. Những người ủng hộ dự án thường bị giới hạn để xem các bản demo của hộp đen, và không thể tương tác với Testnet theo cách hữu hình - với việc phát hành Epik, chúng tôi đang thay đổi hiện trạng bằng cách mang lại *tính khả dụng* và *hữu hình*cho IoTeX Testnet.

IoTeX là một nền tảng cung cấp cơ sở hạ tầng và công cụ cho các công ty và nhà phát triển IoT để xây dựng các DApps mới mang tính cách mạng. Để đạt được điều này, các sáng kiến ​​nội bộ của chúng tôi tập trung vào việc mang lại tính **bảo mật** , **khả năng mở rộng** , **khả năng tương tác** và **quyền riêng tư** cho IoTeX. Tuy nhiên, để IoTeX đạt được tiềm năng đầy đủ của nó, chúng tôi cũng phải đảm bảo rằng **khả năng sử dụng**được ưu tiên, vì nó đóng vai trò là cầu nối giữa người dùng, nhà phát triển và IoTeX. Đây là lý do tại sao chúng tôi ưu tiên triển khai các hợp đồng thông minh và Ví IoTeX trong Epik. Đối với cả người dùng kỹ thuật và phi kỹ thuật, Epik mang đến cơ hội gửi giao dịch và thực hiện hợp đồng thông minh trong Testnet của chúng tôi, cho phép IoTeX bắt đầu thu thập phản hồi về các tính năng có thể sử dụng rất quan trọng đối với trải nghiệm của nhà phát triển.

## 

**Mã thông báo kiểm tra EIOTX, Ví IoTeX và Hợp đồng thông minh**

Bắt đầu từ hôm nay, chúng tôi mời và khuyến khích mọi người tạo Ví IoTeX của riêng họ, thực hiện các giao dịch thử nghiệm (chuyển mã thông báo và bỏ phiếu cho đại biểu) và triển khai các hợp đồng thông minh trên IoTeX Testnet. Trong phần này, chúng tôi giới thiệu mã thông báo thử nghiệm EIOTX và cung cấp tổng quan về các tính năng và giao diện người dùng của Ví IoTeX và chức năng hợp đồng thông minh.

## 

**Mã thông báo kiểm tra EIOTX**

Cùng với sự ra mắt Epik, chúng tôi giới thiệu mã thông báo EIOTX, đây là mã thông báo thử nghiệm có thể được gửi và nhận bởi bất kỳ ai trong IoTeX Testnet. Mặc dù các mã thông báo EIOTX này chỉ là mã thông báo thử nghiệm, tất cả các giao dịch Testnet là có thật và sẽ được thêm vào chuỗi khối và Explorer của IoTeX. Xin lưu ý rằng mã thông báo kiểm tra EIOTX KHÔNG giống như mã thông báo IOTX có thể giao dịch hiện tại hoặc mã thông báo IoTeX Mainnet tương lai - đây là mã thông báo mới **chỉ** có thể sử dụng được trong IoTeX Testnet. Ba loại mã thông báo IoTeX được tóm tắt dưới đây:

* **Mã** thông báo **EIOTX (Testnet)** : Mã thông báo thử nghiệm chỉ có thể sử dụng được trong Epik Testnet. Nó không có bất kỳ giá trị tiền tệ nào và sẽ không thể giao dịch trên bất kỳ sàn giao dịch nào.
* **Mã thông báo IOTX (Pre-Mainnet)** : Mã thông báo ERC-20 hiện đang giao dịch trên các sàn giao dịch, sẽ được chuyển đổi thành mã thông báo IoTeX bản địa sau khi IoTeX Mainnet ra mắt vào Q1 2019.
* **Mã thông báo IoTeX Mainnet (Mainnet)** : Đây sẽ là mã thông báo tiện ích gốc của mạng IoTeX, sẽ có thể giao dịch và khai thác khi ra mắt Mainnet vào quý 1 năm 2019.

## 

**Ví IoTeX**

Ví IoTeX là một tính năng tích hợp mới của Testnet Beta và bất kỳ người dùng nào cũng có thể tạo ví và thực hiện các hành động khác nhau trong Testnet. Tương tự như các ví tiền điện tử khác, khóa công khai và khóa riêng phải được ghi lại để sử dụng lại / mở khóa một ví cụ thể. Như trong hình bên dưới, bảng điều khiển ví được cung cấp, chứa khóa công khai (địa chỉ tài khoản), số lượng mã thông báo kiểm tra EIOTX được giữ và lịch sử giao dịch của một ví cụ thể.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/frux5e20dl621.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed6c5d871ac137d873b6f8f24cd0e881ceaa6853

&#x200B;

Trong tương lai, Ví IoTeX sẽ chịu trách nhiệm nắm giữ tất cả các mã thông báo Mainnet gốc. Ngoài ra, mọi mã thông báo được khởi chạy trên mạng IoTeX cũng sẽ được ví IoTeX hỗ trợ, tương tự như cách mọi mã thông báo ERC-20 có thể được lưu trữ trong ví Ethereum.

Có ba chức năng chính trong Epik mà người dùng có thể khám phá bằng cách sử dụng mã thông báo EIOTX và ví IoTeX: gửi mã thông báo, bỏ phiếu cho đại biểu và triển khai hợp đồng thông minh mà chúng tôi sẽ xem xét trong các phần phụ sau. Để có bản demo hướng dẫn đầy đủ về ba chức năng này, vui lòng xem [video demo](https://youtu.be/10BXKdpofWs) Testnet Beta của chúng tôi  .

## 

**Gửi mã thông báo EIOTX và bỏ phiếu cho ứng viên**

Khả năng trao đổi dữ liệu và giá trị theo kiểu phi tập trung là một trong những lợi ích chính của công nghệ blockchain. Để biến khái niệm này thành hữu hình, chúng tôi đã phát triển giao dịch chuyển mã thông báo và giao diện người dùng bỏ phiếu được tích hợp với ví IoTeX và chuỗi khối Testnet. Sau khi tạo ví, sẽ được điền sẵn mã thông báo EIOTX, người dùng có thể gửi mã thông báo EIOTX (với dữ liệu được thêm tùy chọn) đến các ví khác và bỏ phiếu cho đại biểu qua IoTeX Testnet. Mỗi giao dịch (chuyển mã thông báo và phiếu bầu) sẽ được ghi lại trên blockchain và ID băm giao dịch duy nhất sẽ có thể xem và tìm kiếm được trong [**IoTeX Explorer**](https://iotex.io/explorer) sau khi được xác nhận. Tổng quan về giao diện người dùng và các trường đầu vào được hiển thị bên dưới.

&#x200B;

**Hợp đồng thông minh**

[Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) , người đã đề xuất khái niệm hợp đồng thông minh vào năm 1994, mô tả chúng là *một tập hợp các lời hứa, được chỉ định ở dạng kỹ thuật số, bao gồm các giao thức mà các bên thực hiện theo những lời hứa này.* Nói cách khác, hợp đồng thông minh xác định logic kinh doanh mã) cho một thỏa thuận cụ thể và thực thi có điều kiện các điều khoản của thỏa thuận dựa trên các đầu vào được xác định. Nếu bạn chưa quen với hợp đồng thông minh, vui lòng xem [liên kết](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/) này để giới thiệu sâu hơn, cũng như hướng dẫn hợp đồng thông minh trong [**video Epik**](https://youtu.be/10BXKdpofWs) của chúng tôi .

Trong Testnet Beta, chúng tôi thêm hỗ trợ các hợp đồng thông minh dựa trên Solidity và [Máy ảo Ethereum (EVM)](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-explained/). EVM là một môi trường phi tập trung thực thi các by byodeode, được biên dịch từ các ngôn ngữ lập trình cấp cao hơn, chẳng hạn như Solidity. Trong tương lai, chúng tôi dự định hỗ trợ các máy ảo bổ sung (ví dụ: WASM) và sẽ phát triển máy ảo của riêng chúng tôi phù hợp với các kịch bản IoT. Hợp đồng thông minh có khả năng tự động hóa các quy trình công việc phức tạp, nhiều bên (ví dụ: chuỗi cung ứng) mà không cần người trung gian, trong khi ghi lại lịch sử giao dịch trên blockchain một cách minh bạch. Đây là một cơ hội lớn cho IoT - các tổ chức tự trị phi tập trung (DAO), là các hệ sinh thái blockchain hoạt động tự chủ theo một tập hợp đồng thông minh, có thể được tạo ra để phối hợp các thiết bị không đồng nhất và tạo ra các quy trình làm việc chính xác, không có con người.

Trong IoTeX Testnet, người dùng có thể khám phá hai hành động liên quan đến hợp đồng thông minh: triển khai hợp đồng thông minh, và tương tác với hợp đồng thông minh, được cung cấp trên trang tab hợp đồng thông minh.

&#x200B;

Để thực hiện hợp đồng thông minh trên IoTeX Testnet, trước tiên bạn phải đăng ký hợp đồng với EVM bằng cách triển khai hợp đồng. Như được hiển thị bên dưới, người dùng có thể nhập mã hợp đồng thông minh dựa trên Solidity và tạo giao diện Binary Application (ABI) / JSON và mã byte, sẽ được ghi lại để thực hiện hợp đồng thông minh sau này. Hợp đồng thông minh sau đó có thể được triển khai tới EVM và một địa chỉ hợp đồng sẽ được tạo, duy nhất cho một ví tiền cụ thể và cặp hợp đồng thông minh.

***Dưới đây là mẫu mã hợp đồng thông minh dựa trên Solidity để bạn kiểm tra:***

**Triển khai Hợp đồng thông minh:**

Sau khi hợp đồng thông minh được triển khai và đăng ký vào EVM, người dùng có thể tương tác với hợp đồng thông minh và gọi các chức năng được tích hợp trong hợp đồng thông minh. Các hợp đồng thông minh khác nhau khác nhau về số lượng, mục đích và độ phức tạp của các chức năng. Có hai loại chức năng:

* **Viết hàm** : kích hoạt thay đổi trạng thái trên blockchain (ví dụ: chuyển giá trị, tính toán, gọi đến các hợp đồng khác). Yêu cầu gas, vì các hoạt động được thực hiện trong EVM được thực hiện đồng thời bởi mọi nút trong mạng và một hoặc nhiều đầu vào của người dùng xác định cách thực hiện hợp đồng.
* **Đọc các chức năng** : tìm nạp một điểm dữ liệu từ blockchain, mà không kích hoạt thay đổi trạng thái. Không yêu cầu gas, vì không cần tính toán để đọc dữ liệu. Không có đầu vào người dùng được yêu cầu cho các chức năng đọc.

***Tương tác với Hợp đồng thông minh:***

**Epik thật tuyệt vời - tiếp theo là gì?**

Bản phát hành mã tiếp theo của IoTeX, Testnet Stable / Mainnet Preview, dự kiến ​​sẽ được phát hành vào quý 4 năm 2018. Giai đoạn tiếp theo của phát triển IoTeX sẽ tập trung vào cải thiện bảo mật và độ tin cậy của mã của chúng tôi. Ngoài ra, chúng tôi sẽ tập trung vào quản lý chuỗi con, giao tiếp chuỗi chéo và bộ công cụ phát triển phần mềm (SDK). Vào cuối năm nay, chúng tôi cũng có kế hoạch giới thiệu một số bản demo của blockchain IoTeX chạy trên nhiều thiết bị IoT nhẹ, như chúng tôi đã xem trước trong video demo Testnet Alpha của mình.

Bên cạnh việc làm việc trên Testnet Stable / Mainnet Preview, chúng tôi cũng rất vui được hợp tác với các đối tác chiến lược của chúng tôi để xây dựng bằng chứng về khái niệm, khởi chạy các chương trình con thử nghiệm và phát triển các khả năng mới cho hệ sinh thái IoTeX. Trước khi ra mắt công khai Mainnet vào quý 1 năm 2019, chúng tôi cũng sẽ phát hành một số tài liệu nghiên cứu về đổi mới nội bộ của chúng tôi và chia sẻ chi tiết về các yêu cầu đặt cược, quản trị và hơn thế nữa. Hãy chắc chắn theo dõi các kênh chính thức của chúng tôi để ở trong vòng lặp! Chúng tôi mong muốn được chia sẻ nhiều hơn về sự phát triển của chúng tôi và đạt được những cột mốc lớn hơn và tốt hơn rất sớm.

Релиз Бета-версии тестовой сети (Epik),IoTeX_RU,9bkib3,2018-08-30 11:17:15,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IoTeX_RU/comments/9bkib3/релиз_бетаверсии_тестовой_сети_epik/,Leonid83,,"Те, кто следит за многими блокчейн-проектами, знают, что релизы тестовой сети редко предоставляют пользователям, особенно не техническим, возможность напрямую взаимодействовать со средой тестовой сети. Без возможности выполнения реальных транзакций или смарт-контрактов, сторонники проекта ограничиваются просмотром демо и выработкой концептуального понимания, но никак не могут повзаимодействовать с тестовой сетью ощутимым образом — с этим выпуском, мы меняем статус-кво, привнося удобство и легкость использования тестовой сети IoTeX.


IoTeX - это платформа, которая предоставляет инфраструктуру и инструменты для IoT компаний и разработчиков для создания новых революционных IoT DApps. Для достижения этой цели, наши собственные инновации обеспечивают **безопасность, масштабируемость, совместимость и конфиденциальность**; однако для того, чтобы IoTeX достиг своего полного потенциала, мы должны также обеспечить юзабилити, поскольку она играет решающую роль в создании моста между пользователями, разработчиками и IoTeX. Именно поэтому мы уделили приоритетное *внимание внедрению смарт-контрактов и кошелька в Epik, что позволяет нам начать собирать отзывы о функциях юзабилити*, которые имеют решающее значение для разработчиков.


Открытый исходный код на нашем Github сейчас: https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core

Подробные инструкции по запуску кода Epik приведены в этом файле [README](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/blob/v0.3.0/README.md), а подробное обзорное видео можно найти [здесь](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10BXKdpofWs)


Тестовые токены EIOTX, кошелек IoTeX и смарт-контракты
Начиная с сегодняшнего дня, мы приглашаем и призываем всех создать свой собственный кошелек IoTeX, совершить тестовые транзакции (переводы токенов и голосование за делегатов), а также развернуть смарт-контракты в тестовой сети IoTeX. В этом разделе мы представляем тестовый токен EIOTX и обзор функций и пользовательского интерфейса кошелька и функций смарт-контракта.


**Тестовые токены EIOTX**


Наряду с запуском Epik, мы представляем токены EIOTX, которые являются тестовыми токенами, и могут быть отправлены и получены любым пользователем в тестовой сети IoTeX. Хотя эти токены EIOTX являются только тестовыми, все транзакции в тестнете реальны и будут добавлены в блокчейн и IoTeX Explorer. Обратите внимание, что EIOTX не совпадает с текущим рыночным токеном IOTX или будущем IoTeX токеном в майннете — это новый маркер, который может использоваться только в тестовом режиме. Ниже приведены три типа токенов IoTeX:

* **EIOTX токен (Тестнет)**: Тестовый токен можно использовать только в тестовой сети Epik. Он не имеет никакой денежной ценности и не будут торговаться на биржах.

* **IOTX токен(При-майннет)**: Токен ERC-20, который в настоящее время торгуется на биржах, и будет переведен в нативный IoTeX токен после выхода главной сети в первом квартале 2019 года.

* **IoTeX майннет токен (Майннет)**: Это будет нативный утилити токен для сети IoTeX, который будет торговаться и майнится после выхода главной сети в первом квартале 2019 года.


Epik назван в честь [Robert “Rob” C. Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), канадского программиста и автора, который внес свой вклад в создание языков программирования Go (Golang), Limbo и Sawzall. Как вы, возможно, уже заметили, Epik-это перестановка “Pike”, следуя нашей тенденции называть каждый выпуск кода IoTeX после одного из наших технологических идолов.


Pike наиболее известен своим вкладом в языки программирования, графические терминалы, патенты, множество текстовых редакторов и многое другое. Блокчейн IoTeX кодируется в Golang, который Pike создал из-за простоты развертывания, функций параллелизма, сосредоточения на масштабируемости и т.д. Кодовое название этого релиза “Epic” является данью инновациям Pike, которые обеспечивают строительные блоки для IoTeX, других компаний и разработчиков по всему миру для сегодняшних инноваций.



**Обзор и функций Epik**


В нашем втором выпуске кода, тестнет Альфа (кодовое имя “Strive”), мы представили несколько собственных инноваций, которые показали, как первоначальные дизайнерские решения IoTeX работают вместе. Strive заложил первоначальный план видения IoTeX для создания приватного, масштабируемого и совместимого блокчейна, не жертвуя безопасностью и производительностью. Наряду с выпуском кода, мы также продемонстрировали код, выполняемый на облегченных устройствах Интернета Вещей. Для получения более подробной информации о нашей предыдущей версии, пожалуйста, смотрите наш блог о [Strive](https://medium.com/iotex-ru/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8-iotex-%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%84%D0%B0-strive-968d63cc0cfd) и [демо-видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAw7_H71o7s).

За последние два месяца, технологическая команда IoTeX не только улучшила код Strive, но и разработала множество новых функций для Epik, ориентированных на обеспечение *удобства использования* и *ценности* тестовой сети IoTeX. Некоторые из ключевых особенностей Epik включают в себя:

🔸 Поддержку виртуальной машины **Ethereum (EVM)** и **смарт-контрактов** основанных на языке Solidity

🔸 Интеграцию IoTeX **кошелька** 

🔸 Усовершенствования **Roll-DPoS  и симуляции процесса голосования**

🔸 Реализацию шифрования **BLS** и **DKG** (генерация двойного ключа)

🔸 Обновления с сохранением работы

🔸 Поддержку более **100 физически распределенных узлов**


В дополнение к этим новым функциям, мы значительно улучшили стабильность и производительность нашего блокчейна благодаря проведению нескольких “недель качества”. Например, производительность нашей базы данных улучшилась в ~10 раз, и мы достигли 100+ завершенных транзакций в секунду (FTPS).

Для получения полного списка функций и инкрементального сравнения между тестнет Альфа “Strive” и тестнет Бета “Epik”, пожалуйста, смотрите [таблицу](https://i.redd.it/nhoaaqehu8j11.png)



**Epik замечательный — а что дальше?**

Следующий релиз кода IoTeX, тестнет Стабильный/майннет Привью, планируется выйти в конце четвертого квартала 2018. Следующий этап разработки IoTeX будет сосредоточен на повышении безопасности и надежности нашего кода. Кроме того, мы сосредоточимся на управлении субцепями, межцепочной коммуникацией, и набором для разработки программного обеспечения (SDK). К концу года, мы также планируем продемонстрировать несколько демо роликов блокчейна IoTeX, работающего на различных легковесных устройствах IoT, похожих на предварительный просмотр в демо для тестнета Альфа.


В дополнение к работе над тестнет Стабильный/майннет Привью, мы также рады сотрудничать с нашими стратегическими партнерами для создания доказательств концепции, запуска пилотных субцепей и разработки новых возможностей для экосистемы IoTeX. Перед публичным запуском нашей основной сети в первом квартале 2019 года, мы также выпустим несколько исследовательских работ по нашим собственным инновациям и поделимся подробностями о требованиях для стейкинга, управления и многом другом. Обязательно следите за нашими официальными каналами, чтобы оставаться в курсе! Мы будем продолжать делится с вами нашим прогрессом и достижениях.
