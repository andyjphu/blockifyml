In order to advance research and get treatments, we need to be participating in clinical trials whenever possible. The faster these trials are completed, the faster we can get treatments. If you are able, please consider looking through this guide to find a trial that works for you. Use the link to find the study contact info, as well as other pertinent information (treatment, exclusion/inclusion criteria). I understand brain fog and fatigue is a significant factor, so if you need help, please pm me. These trials were found through https://clinicaltrials.gov/  - please add additional ones in comments.

ONE+ with xDrip+ and Dexcom Receiver simultaneously,dexcom,1i9x08c,2025-01-25 16:04:14,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dexcom/comments/1i9x08c/one_with_xdrip_and_dexcom_receiver_simultaneously/,SuspiciouslyDullGuy,Receiver,"Posted a question about his some time ago, creating a fresh post now so that people see it and are aware that this solution works in case it might be useful to someone.

The Dexcom ONE+ app will not install on an Android phone which is not on the supported device list (as far as I can tell).  In my own case the app was not available to me in Google Play via the search function.  When I Googled the app in a browser and clicked the app link I got a 'not available on your device' message or similar.  I had thought the supported device list was guidance, not a complete list.

I got xDrip+ working on my (Asus) phone running Android 14 following these instructions and the main xDrip+ instructions which are linked from this page: [https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.html](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.html)

After following these instructions I had intermittent Bluetooth connection problems.  I found a 'battery saving' setting on my phone which messes with background processes, presumably by slowing them down.  With that setting disabled xDrip+ has worked (almost) perfectly over 12 days of use and two sensors though the battery life on my phone has decreased.  Bluetooth connectivity dropped just once, requiring me to disable/enable Bluetooth on my phone and tap the 'restart collector' button in xDrip+ to get it going again.

In order to make it easier to get replacement sensors if I need them in future I bought the Dexcom Receiver device for the ONE+ - €69 in Ireland.  Officially-supported with fault event logging functions and enables data to be uploaded to the Clarity system via a USB cable connected to a computer, as needed.  I was and am able to run xDrip+ and the Receiver simultaneously - they do not interfere with each other.  When I connected the Receiver to my first sensor it pulled maybe seven days worth of readings from the sensor.  If the sensor and Receiver are out of range of each other for some time the Receiver will disconnect.  Waking up the device by tapping a button on it and waiting a few minutes will re-establish the connection, at which time it will pull in any missed readings.

This solution may be suitable for someone with an unsupported Android phone with a supported OS version though may require some troubleshooting to get xDrip+ working well.  The xDrip+ app is much more sophisticated than the Receiver and has some very useful features.  The capability to look back at graphs from previous days and zoom in to see greater detail is one I find very useful and a huge improvement over the Libre 2 app I'm familiar with.   Use of the Receiver may be useful for those who rely on BG alerts and where xDrip+ is not perfectly reliable for them.  The receiver has a speaker on it and has low blood glucose alert features.  xDrip has very sophisticated alert features but perhaps isn't quite as reliable as the Receiver, given that Bluetooth did disconnect for me on one occasion.   The capability to upload to Clarity may also be useful for those who want the sophistication of xDrip+ but need to generate those specific reports for their care team."

Nokia 215 4g (2024) review,dumbphones,1i9w5cg,2025-01-25 15:26:26,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/1i9w5cg/nokia_215_4g_2024_review/,Timber1802,Tech Review,"**Introduction**  
Hey everyone! After using my Nokia 215 4G (2024 edition), I feel ready to share a review of this device for anyone considering a purchase.  
*Note: I live in Europe, and there may be some small differences in app availability depending on the region.*

**TL;DR**  
Calling and (threaded) texting work great if you enjoy T9. Music playback is fine if you're okay with listening to albums or manually creating playlists by organizing songs into folders. However, note that the aux output is quite loud, even at the lowest setting. The browser is subpar, and there are no smart apps available.

**Background**  
I was looking for a dumbphone to, almost\*, replace my smartphone due to the excessive time I spent on it. My main problem app was Instagram, which I eventually deleted. I then replaced it with YouTube, and after shutting that off (which can't be done through the normal method), I turned to Reddit. After deleting Reddit, I found myself browsing the web. Yes, I was thoroughly addicted to scrolling.  
So, I went in search of a decent dumbphone. It needed to support 4G since 2G is already shut down and 3G will be phased out within two years where I live. Nokia seemed to be the only widely available manufacturer in my area. Other brands like Nothing and Punkt were too expensive for my taste. The Nokia 2xx series caught my eye because the devices look sleek and are reasonably priced. The 215 lacks a camera and is cheaper than the 225 and 235, which do have cameras. Since those cameras are only 2MP, I figured I might as well save some money and go without a camera. The 215 does come with a flashlight option. I also learned that these devices run on S30+, which, according to reviews, is not great but still better than KaiOS.

\*I need a smart device that allows me to enter my gym and still log into WhatsApp Web. If I ever find a way to manage this, I will consider giving up my smartphone entirely.

**Now onto the device**

**What's in the box?**  
The phone, a charger, and a user manual.

**Form Factor**  
The phone measures 127.2 x 54.2 x 11.6 mm (5.01 x 2.13 x 0.46 in).  
To be honest, I expected the device to be a bit smaller. It is slightly larger than many dumbphones from back in the day, but it’s definitely not too big. After using it for a while, I actually like the size a lot. The 2.8-inch screen allows you to see a good amount of text at once.

**Hardware and Connectivity**  
The phone feels well-built, and the keys are satisfying to press. They are also backlit, which I appreciate. The screen is adequate for its purpose. The speaker is surprisingly good, and the vibration motor is quite powerful. The battery is removable. It features two nano SIM card slots and a single microSD slot that supports up to 32GB.  
Bluetooth works very well, automatically connecting to my Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and Sony WH-1000XM3. Note: the Bluetooth device has its own volume control, so there is no absolute volume setting. This is a good feature bacause: using wired headphones with this phone will likely be too loud for you, even at the lowest volume setting.  
The 215 supports 2G, 3G, and 4G on various bands.

**Calling**  
Calling quality is excellent. You can hear the person on the other end clearly, and they can hear you well too.

**Texting**  
Texting is done via T9. As an older Gen Z (born in 2000), I used T9 phones before switching to smartphones, so I'm fairly quick at typing on T9. However, I'm still slower than I would be on a touchscreen or QWERTY keyboard. The 215 does support threaded messaging.

**Settings**  
The phone has a lot of settings, such as the ability to disable notification sounds for texts while keeping sounds for calls. However, the way to access and select these options is not intuitive. I only figured it out after reading the manual, which is surprising considering I'm quite tech-savvy.

**Browser**  
The 215 comes with Opera Mini, a simplified version of Opera. It will work for basic tasks, like looking up a phone number, but don’t expect modern websites to run smoothly on it. Features like WhatsApp Web and Facebook are unavailable.

**Music**  
To play music, you need a microSD card. The phone is particular about file formats; I found that .m4a with AAC encoding worked, while MP3 files did not. The method of listening to music is fine for my usage, but there is no dedicated music app. Instead, you navigate to Files, then Music, and select your desired songs from there. Listening to albums works well, but creating playlists is cumbersome—you have to access a random song, go back, select Playlists, and then choose your playlist.

**FM Radio**  
The FM radio works well, especially with wired headphones. Unfortunately, it doesn’t remember your favorite stations after a power cycle, although it sometimes retains the names you assigned to the stations.

**Battery Life**  
Using just calling and texting gives me about five days of battery life. If I play a lot of music, it drops to about two to three days. Of course, your usage will greatly impact how long the battery lasts on a charge.

**Games**  
There are some pre-installed games that cannot be deleted. All of them are pretty basic, akin to what you’d find on bootleg consoles in cheap shops. Some games require payment after a few plays. The games include Snake, Racing Attack\*, Blackjack, Football Cup\*, Arrow Master, Doodle Jump\*, Crossy Road\*, Air Strike, and Ninja Up.

\*payment required after three trials.

**Verdict**

I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a simple device to either replace or complement their smartphone. It functions well as a basic phone and offers just what I was seeking. In fact, my girlfriend just received hers.

P.S. If you have any specific questions about how to accomplish tasks without a smartphone or inquiries about the phone itself, please feel free to leave a comment."

# Upgrade Your Python Toolbox for 2025: Discover the Essential Libraries You’re Missing Out On

Python’s powerful, but your tools can make you a coding god or a frustrated mess. *Don’t be that developer stuck using outdated tools while the rest of the world is speeding ahead*

**Many** developers are still heavily reliant on libraries like Pandas, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, but these aren’t always the most efficient solutions for modern development needs. In this article, we’ll explore some of the top emerging Python libraries for 2025 that will supercharge your development process and help you stay ahead of the curve.

# A) Outdated Libraries and Better Replacements

# 1. Ditch OS For File Operations: Use pathlib

The os module is often cumbersome for file and path handling due to *issues like* ***platform-specific*** *path separators and* ***verbose syntax***\*.\* pathlib simplifies this with intuitive object-oriented methods like for joining paths, .exists(), and .is\_file() for checks, making cross-platform compatibility seamless. With its cleaner syntax and built-in features, pathlib eliminates the need for manual adjustments, becoming the go-to solution for modern Python developers

# Example:

    from pathlib import Path
    
    
    # Creating a file
    file = Path(""example.txt"")
    file.write_text(""Hello, Pathlib!"")
    
    
    # Reading the file
    print(file.read_text())
    
    
    # Checking existence
    if file.exists():
        print(""File exists"")

# Why Switch?

`pathlib` just makes life easier. It’s more intuitive than `os`, with its object-oriented approach to working with files and paths. You won’t have to worry about platform-specific issues (like `\` vs `/`) because `pathlib` handles all that for you. Plus, the syntax is cleaner and more readable.

# 2. Replace Requests with httpx: A Modern HTTP Client for Asynchronous and Synchronous Requests

`HTTPS` has emerged as a powerful **alternative to requests**, especially in 2025. Unlike `requests`, HTTPX also offers **HTTP/2 support**, which can dramatically reduce latency and improve request handling by allowing multiplexed connections. `httpx`—a modern alternative that supports async operations without sacrificing the simplicity and familiarity of the Requests API.

# Example:

    import httpx
    import asyncio
    # asyncio is used to enable asynchronous programming, 
    # and it's integral to httpx for non-blocking HTTP requests.
    # With httpx, you can use async/await syntax to run multiple HTTP requests concurrently.
    
    
    # Demonstrating Asynchronous Requests with httpx
    async def async_get_data():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""Async Response:"", response.json())
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the asynchronous request
    asyncio.run(async_get_data())
    
    # Asynchronous HTTP/2 Request with httpx
    async def async_http2_request():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(http2=True) as client:
            response = await client.get('https://http2.golang.org/reqinfo')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""HTTP/2 Response:"", response.text)
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the HTTP/2 request
    asyncio.run(async_http2_request())
    
    # Connection Pooling with httpx Client
    def connection_pooling_example():
        with httpx.Client(keep_alive=True) as client:
            url = ""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1""
            # Multiple requests using connection pooling
            for _ in range(5):
                response = client.get(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    print(""Response Content:"", response.text)
                else:
                    print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the connection pooling example
    connection_pooling_example()

# Why Use httpx?

If you’re working on applications that demand **high concurrency**, such as web scraping or microservices, HTTPX’s support for **asynchronous operations** offers significant performance improvements.

>

Essentially, if you're working with a lot of I/O, `httpx` will save you a lot of headaches.

# 3. **Move Beyond Pandas: Use Polars

`Pandas`is perfect for small to mid-sized datasets, but when you throw larger datasets at it, the memory usage and performance starts to suffer.

>

`Polars` is a modern, **memory-efficient**, and **multi-threaded data processing Rust-based backend library** that provides a **faster alternative to Pandas** for large datasets. Unlike **Pandas**, Polars supports **parallel processing**, which speeds up **data manipulation** tasks

# Example:

    import polars as pl
    
    # Create a Polars DataFrame from a dictionary with sample data
    data = pl.DataFrame({
        ""name"": [""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie"", ""David""],
        ""age"": [25, 30, 35, 40],
        ""salary"": [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000]
    })
    
    print(""Original DataFrame:"")
    print(data)
    # Output:
    # shape: (4, 3)
    # ┌─────────┬─────┬────────┐
    # │ name    ┆ age ┆ salary │
    # │ ---     ┆ --- ┆ ---    │
    # │ str     ┆ i64 ┆ i64    │
    # ╞═════════╪═════╪════════╡
    # │ Alice   ┆ 25  ┆ 50000  │
    # │ Bob     ┆ 30  ┆ 60000  │
    # │ Charlie ┆ 35  ┆ 70000  │
    # │ David   ┆ 40  ┆ 80000  │
    # └─────────┴─────┴────────┘
    # This shows the original DataFrame with 4 rows and 3 columns: ""name"", ""age"", ""salary""
    
    # Perform lazy evaluation to prepare for filtering, sorting, and selecting data
    result = (
        data.lazy()  # Converts the DataFrame to a lazy query, operations will not be executed yet
        .filter(pl.col(""age"") > 30)  # Filter rows where age > 30 (Charlie, David)
        .sort(""salary"", reverse=True)  # Sort by salary in descending order (David first, Charlie second)
        .select([""name"", ""salary""])  # Select only ""name"" and ""salary"" columns
        .collect()  # Trigger computation and get the result
    )
    
    print(""\nFiltered, Sorted, and Selected Data:"")
    print(result)
    # Output:
    # Filtered, Sorted, and Selected Data:
    # shape: (2, 2)
    # ┌─────────┬────────┐
    # │ name    ┆ salary │
    # │ ---     ┆ ---    │
    # │ str     ┆ i64    │
    # ╞═════════╪════════╡
    # │ David   ┆ 80000  │
    # │ Charlie ┆ 70000  │
    # └─────────┴────────┘
    # This output shows that only two rows (""Charlie"" and ""David"") are left after filtering by age > 30.
    # The rows are sorted by salary in descending order, with ""David"" (salary 80000) appearing first, followed by ""Charlie"" (salary 70000).

# Why Polars?

So, if you’re dealing with **large-scale data processing**, need **parallel execution**, or want a **memory-efficient** solution, **Polars** is the superior choice for modern data science and analytics..Pandas might be your first love, but `Polars` is the one who can handle the heavy lifting.

# 4. Upgrade Your Testing Game: Replace unittest with pytest

`unittest`? Sure, it works, but come on, it’s 2025. You ain’t pulling any bitches with that. It’s like trying to impress someone with a flip phone when everyone’s rocking iPhones. Yeah, it works, but it’s a total hassle. `pytest`\*\*: it’s the cool, modern testing framework that makes writing and reading tests way easier.\*\*

# Wait, What’s unittest?

For the uninitiated, `unittest` is Python's built-in testing framework, but it ***often feels outdated with verbose syntax and repetitive boilerplate***. With, you get powerful features like flexible fixture management, automatic test discovery, and built-in parameterization (using u/pytest`.mark.parametrize`) to easily run the same test with different inputs. It also supports parallel test execution via `pytest-xdist`, which boosts performance for large test suites.

# Example:

    # test_sample.py
    
    # Importing pytest library for testing
    import pytest
    
    # Simple function to add two numbers
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y  
    
    # Test function to check if add(x, y) returns the correct result
    def test_add():  # Note: function started with ""test_""
        # Checking if 2 + 3 equals 5
        assert add(2, 3) == 5  # If the add function works, this should pass
        # No output is printed because pytest handles the test results automatically
    
    # Expected output after running pytest:
    # ===================== test session starts =====================
    # collected 1 item
    # 
    # test_sample.py .                                        [100%]
    # 
    # ===================== 1 passed in 0.03 seconds =====================

# Why test_?

By using the `test_` prefix, you make it clear to pytest that these functions are supposed to be tests. It’s part of pytest's convention to discover and run the correct functions without any additional configuration.

"Dell XPS 15 consistent issues with power, shutdowns, startups, charging etc.",techsupport,1i9vio6,2025-01-25 14:58:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1i9vio6/dell_xps_15_consistent_issues_with_power/,estoytom,Open | Hardware,"Hi all, I recently purchased a Dell XPS 15 7590 from my workplace as they were doing a charity sale. I'm aware that the model is slightly old now, but with 32GB RAM, an i7 and a decent Nvidia graphics card, it was a deal that I couldn't turn down. On the first day, the device worked fine. Since then, there has been non-stop consistent issues which has basically registered the device unusable at least at this current moment. The following are the issues that I've faced:

* Inconsistent booting and powerup. At this current point, I cannot make the device turn on. I installed some updates on the device when it was on and after restarting it would not power on. I've tried following the hard reset and power cycle guides online and while they seem to work and the keyboard backlight comes on, the power light and fans come on, they only remain on for a few seconds before powering off. I'm trying everything including unplugging the charger, power cycling and I even took the back of the laptop off to remove and drain the battery to start again. Sometimes I get the flashing white and orange indicator.
* System Service Tag. I've set the service tag twice now, yet the PC just doesn't seem to remember it. I boot from BIOS and set the service tag. I've seen that some others have had this issue and one of the forums on the Dell website said to update the BIOS to the latest version, which is what I did, but the issue still persists.
* Only running in Manufacturing Mode. The only way that I'm able to run the laptop consistently is in Manufacturing mode. On startup, I get a black screen saying the laptop is in manufacturing mode and if I press Alt + F, it'll turn off. If I turn manufacturing mode off, the laptop works for a couple of minutes, then shuts off completely, very rarely wanting to turn back on, which makes it super annoying when trying to reproduce the issue. The PC seems to run fine in manufacturing mode, but this causes the PCs fans to run at 100%, which is both noisy and also cannot be good for the PC in the long-term. Even after starting up in manufacturing mode, signing in and pressing Fn + x, the fans power down and after a couple of seconds, the PC shuts off again. It even also sometimes shuts down while in manufacturing mode, which is something that has just happened after trying to reset my pin to log in.
* Consistent unexpected shutdowns. The PC just shuts down randomly. After signing in (in normal mode), it could take a couple of minutes but the PC just shuts down and it's very difficult to turn it back on. It takes a combination of different patterns of holding the power button, plugging and unplugging the charger, powercycling to power it back on. It often takes just leaving it for 30 minutes before it decides it wants to power on again.
* Inconsistent charging. I noticed yesterday that while the charger is fully functional and works as expected, sometimes the PC won't charge. It's very intermittent if it decides that it wants to charge.

Am I blind in love?,relationships,1i9vhg7,2025-01-25 14:57:19,6,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i9vhg7/am_i_blind_in_love/,Angels_Rose_,,"
Hey guys, I’ve been in a 5 months relationship with my boyfriend and I have known him for 6 months. We started talking online on X and he moved into the city I was studying in because he had gotten a job there. I’m 22 and he’s 24. 

I had my own apartment where I stayed alone, he was staying at his uncle’s place because he was still picking up his life. I was just a student and he had a real estate agent job, things weren’t working out at his work place because the company had not paid its royalties and wasn’t functioning.

The relationship started off on a great note, we agreed on a 50/50 relationship but some how in the long run I felt as though I was spending more than he was. He’d always come to my place every weekend, which I didn’t mind but it got a bit too much because he wouldn’t help me out with groceries and he’d only buy us takeaways once in a while. I’d find myself doing the dishes and he wouldn’t help out because he claimed to not like washing dishes, initially since I was hosting I wouldn’t expect that from him but in the long run he started being at my place every weekend and I’d expect a helping hand. He only took me out on a date the first time we met and afterwards he’d plan for us to go out but would only want us to go out only if we’re splitting the bill. I felt as though it was a bit unfair since he wasn’t helping out with groceries and stuff. He’d always pull through empty handed. I confronted him about this and he took accountability and said he felt guilty about everything and didn’t step up because he tends to zone out subconsciously and reacts late to things which I felt was a lame excuse, I felt as though he didn’t want to help out since he’d say he spends a lot of money on Ubering to my place. I feel he’s stingy. 

Another thing is, I’m graduating this year and he’s not at school due to finances and had to drop out in his first year because of that. He’s not working and is always at home , doing nothing productive. I’m worried now that I’ll be employed soon and he won’t be and that might change the dynamic of our relationship. I sometimes feel as though I deserve better than a man who gives me the bare minimum even though he comes from a well established home. 

He’s a great guy, don’t get me wrong but love alone isn’t enough. We’re now in a 350km long distance since he had to go back home because the job didn’t work out and I’m back at home now because I’m done at school. 

TL;DR:
My boyfriend (5 months) moved to my city for work, but his job failed. I’ve been spending more in our relationship, as he doesn’t contribute to groceries, chores, or expenses during his frequent visits. Now that we’re in a 350km long-distance relationship, I worry about our future dynamic when I’m employed, and he’s still not working or studying. I care for him, but I feel I deserve more effort and support from him."

A sad modding story. I got Tale of Two Wastelands working on the Steam Deck and without any help from a Windows PC. It was great. I followed the Best Of Times guide on how to set everything up and yes, it took some hours but got it working!
I played some, added some more cool mods, like more weapons and quests and did some quality of life tweaks (hacking minigame sucks). Life was great.
I played through the Fallout 3 portion, found the train and continued to the Mojave where Benny Humbled me big time.
Got back on my feet, did a lot of questing and as soon as I was about to confront Benny at the Tops, the game crashed. I reloaded a bunch of times and everytime it crashed as I entered the Tops Casino.
Then, in that bleak moment of my sanity, I verified the integrity of the game files. A sore mistake. It bricked Mo2 and I could'nt start the game at all anymore.
So decided to do a fresh install on everything. Wasted a lot of hours. Now Mo2 just says Steam is not running and it's not starting the game. I have to move on, for my own sanity. But if it helps, it can be done and it was glorious for a brief moment.
Maybe after some years of healing, I might try it again"

The Continuous Geometric Flow for the Minimal Model Program: Bridging Birational Geometry and Geometric Analysis,AI_Mathematics,1i9v0lw,2025-01-25 14:36:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Mathematics/comments/1i9v0lw/the_continuous_geometric_flow_for_the_minimal/,PromptAdventurous269,,"# Abstract

In this paper, I introduce a continuous geometric flow on algebraic varieties that dynamically realizes the Minimal Model Program (MMP), unifying discrete birational transformations (flips, flops, contractions) into a smooth PDE-driven framework. By replacing Riemannian curvature with intersection-theoretic invariants (e.g., the canonical class K\_X) and defining algebraic surgeries via symplectic cuts in the Néron-Severi group, I construct a flow that evolves varieties toward minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. Key results include:

1. Energy Functional and Regularization: A Perelman-style entropy functional ensuring singularity avoidance and flow monotonicity.
2. Surgery Protocol: Symplectic moment maps encoding extremal rays, with surgeries as gradient steps in stratified divisor classes.
3. Bridgeland Stability Correspondence: Stability conditions tied to flow trajectories, linking MMP transitions to wall-crossing phenomena.
4. Low-Dimensional Validation: Explicit solutions for del Pezzo surfaces and toric varieties, matching classical MMP steps.

This work reimagines the MMP as a dynamical system, with applications to moduli spaces, classification, and arithmetic geometry.

# 1. Introduction

# Motivation

The Minimal Model Program (MMP) classifies algebraic varieties via discrete birational surgeries (flips, flops, contractions). While powerful, its stepwise nature contrasts with the analytic continuity of geometric flows like Ricci flow, which dynamically evolves manifolds toward canonical geometries. I bridge this gap by constructing a continuous geometric flow that realizes the MMP as a smooth PDE-driven process.

# Core Idea

I define a flow on the Néron-Severi group NS(X) ⊗ R, governed by intersection-theoretic invariants (e.g., K\_X · L\^(n-1)) and regularized by log canonical thresholds. Surgeries (flips, flops) are encoded as symplectic cuts in the stratified space of divisor classes.

# 

# Applications

* Dynamic classification of varieties of general type
* Paths in moduli spaces as flow trajectories
* Arithmetic extensions for Diophantine equations

# 2. The Flow Equation and Energy Functional

# Setup

Let X be a smooth projective variety, L\_t ∈ NS(X) ⊗ R a family of divisor classes, and K\_X the canonical class.

# Energy Functional

E(L\_t) = ∫\_X (K\_X · L\_t\^(n-1))\^2 + λ · lct(X, L\_t)

where lct(X, L\_t) is the log canonical threshold of L\_t.

# Flow Equation

∂L\_t/∂t = -∇E(L\_t)

driving L\_t toward nefness while penalizing singularities.

# Monotonicity

Using Hölder's inequality and inversion of adjunction, I prove d/dt E(L\_t) ≤ 0.

# Comparison to Kähler-Ricci Flow

Unlike Kähler-Ricci flow, this flow operates purely on divisor classes, avoiding metric dependencies. Surgeries replace Ricci flow's neck-pinching with algebraic modifications.

# 3. Surgery via Symplectic Cuts

# Symplectic Framework

I treat NS(X) ⊗ R as a stratified symplectic manifold. Extremal rays correspond to critical loci of a moment map μ: NS(X) → g\*.

# Surgery Protocol

1. Detection: A singularity occurs when μ(L\_t) intersects a flipping/flopping locus
2. Symplectic Cut: Perform a gradient step in the stratified space, replacing L\_t with a flipped/flopped divisor class
3. Restart: Continue the flow on the new birational model

# Example (Atiyah Flop)

For xy - zw = 0 ⊂ C\^4, the flow transitions between small resolutions via a symplectic cut in the fan's edge space.

# 4. Bridgeland Stability and Flow Trajectories

# Stability Conditions

I define a family of Bridgeland stability conditions σ\_t with central charge:

Z\_t(F) = ∫\_X e\^(-L\_t) · ch(F) · √td(X)

# Wall-Crossing

Surgeries correspond to stability wall-crossings, with flips/flops induced by autoequivalences in D\^b(X).

# Theorem

If L\_t-stability coincides with σ\_t-stability, the flow trajectory avoids walls until surgery.

# 5. Case Studies

# Surfaces

For X = Bl\_p P\^2, the flow reduces to an ODE:

d/dt ℓ\_t = -(ℓ\_t\^2 - 1)ℓ\_t

where ℓ\_t is the length of the (-1)-curve. Solution: ℓ\_t → 0 in finite time, contracting to P\^2.

# Toric Varieties

In SageMath, I simulate the flow for P\^2 blown up at 3 points. Track fan edge contractions, matching toric MMP steps.

# 6. Applications and Conjectures

# Classification

* Dynamic Abundance Conjecture: If K\_X is pseudo-effective, the flow terminates at a minimal model
* Surgery Finiteness: For varieties of general type, surgeries terminate by h\^0(mK\_X)-growth

# Moduli Spaces

Flow trajectories in M\_g correspond to stability chamber transitions.

# Arithmetic Geometry

Extend to arithmetic schemes X → Spec(O\_K), relating flow singularities to Bad reduction.

# 7. Conclusion

This work transforms the MMP into a continuous dynamical system, unifying algebraic geometry, analysis, and topology. Future directions include:

* Extensions to positive characteristic via foliations
* Deep learning for high-dimensional flow simulation
* Quantum refinements using Gromov-Witten invariants

By transcending the MMP's discrete logic, this flow offers a new lens to explore the geometry of moduli, classification, and arithmetic."

The Bingo challenge is always a highlight of April for me - it's fun, always surprising, and gives me an excuse to shake up my TBR. This is my eighth card, and I’m already looking forward to the next one.

# Bingo 2024: Difficulty

Okay, I know this is subjective, but I found this year’s Bingo to be the easiest one yet. Most of the squares ""slotted"" into my reading naturally, and only two (Bards, Published in 1990s) required some actual research. One of those books turned out to be amazing; the other… let’s just say it wasn’t.

# Favorite Squares

* ***Judge a Book by Its Cover***: Super fun square! Plus, I picked a brilliant book for it, but your mileage may vary and perhaps I was just lucky.
* ***Eldritch Creatures:*** I love horror, so this was right up my alley.
* ***Small Town***: Something about cozy (or creepy) small-town vibes always hooks me.
* **Survival:** Who doesn’t love a good survival story?

# Least Favorite Squares

* ***Book Club/Readalong:*** Ironically, I lead a book club, yet this square always feels like a chore. Why? It gives less room for personal choice, and yes, I know I'm being irrational. The database of eligible books is massive. But I can't help it - it makes me feel it's a closed set and I like to have freedom :P Irrational, as mentioned. Happily, the book I picked for it is one of my favorite books read in 2024.
* ***The Bard***: Surprisingly, bards aren't that easy to find nowadays. The book I picked for this square was the weakest thing I read all year, but that’s on me. I could’ve done a better research.
* ***Romantasy:*** Look, I’m not a romance reader, so this square was always going to be a slog for me. I prefer my books dark, gritty, and romance-free. Fortunately, the book that happens to meet the criteria of the square is excellent, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

# BOOKS & MINI-REVIEWS

Here are my mini-reviews for each square. Most of these are shortened versions of my Goodreads reviews. Ideally, my Bingo card would feature only books I rated 4 stars or higher, but some squares make that tricky. If you have any recommendations for the trickier squares, hit me up - I want my card to represent the *best* books (that fit bingo squares) I read during the Bingo period.

# Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey

**First in a Series (HM);** *also* *Criminals, Under the Surface, Dreams, Multi-POV. Space Opera*

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

Confession time: I liked the TV series more. But that aside, this was still a great read. It’s epic but with a tight focus on personal stakes and well-rounded characters. The story is immersive, the ideas are clever, and there’s a reason this one’s a modern sci-fi classic.

# The Book That Broke The World by Mark Lawrence

**Alliterative Title (HM)**; *also Romantasy (I think), Dark Academia (probably), Under The Surface*

**Rating**: ★★★★½

Mark Lawrence really knows how to keep you hooked. This sequel is darker, faster-paced, and full of surprises. The multiple POVs and time jumps were cool. Livira and Malar’s struggles hit hard, and the insectoid enemies are creepy af.

# Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi

**Under the Surface**; also  *First in a series, Dreams, Character with a Disability, Survival, Published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Political intrigue? Check. Deeply personal stakes? Double check. Scheming Machiavellian side characters? Oh, yes. Navola delivers all this and more. Bacigalupi shifts from heartfelt moments to bursts of calculated violence and an overwhelming sense of bleakness with ease and perfect timing, and I savored every second of it. My favorite book of 2024.

# Dig Two Graves by Craig Schaefer

**Criminals (HM)**; *also Self Published, published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★½

As a massive fan of the Daniel Faust series, I might be biased, but this was fantastic. Sharp writing, morally grey characters, and an addictive plot made it one of my favorites.

# The Dream Master by Roger Zelazny

**Dreams (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

The Dream Master holds well despite being almost 60 years old. It has an outstanding premise - Charles Render specializes in neuroparticipation. Basically, he creates and controls/constructs dreams of his patients to get an insight into their neuroses and problems. Render takes on a patient with congenital blindness and a hunger for visual stimuli.

# Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boule

**Entitled Animals (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

I saw at least two *Planet of the Apes* movies and enjoyed them. The story itself is immersive and action-packed, but some of the social dynamics haven’t aged well. Still, it’s an entertaining classic that I’m glad I read.

# Bard Tidings by Paul Regnier

**Bards (HM)**, also self-published

**Rating:** ★★

Fully predictable and instantly forgettable. The weakest book on my Bingo card. I picked it on a whim from Kindle Unlimited, and, well… mistakes were made.

# The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk

**Prologues/Epilogues;**

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Empusium is a strange, slow, and fascinating book. It’s part gothic horror, part social critique, and part... well, something that doesn’t really fit into any category. Call it Weirdlit, if you need to. Anyway, if you’re looking for fast-paced thrills and gruesome horrors, this isn’t it. But if you enjoy well-written and unsettling books with elegant and plastic prose you’re in for a treat.

# Thrill Switch by Tim Hawken

**Self Published**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A cyberpunk thriller that pulls no punches. Brutal but brilliant.

# Fool's Promise by Angela Boord

**Romantasy (HM)**; also Dreams, Self-Published, Disabled (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★½

Fool’s Promise is a brilliant sequel that not only lives up to the high expectations set by the Fortune’s Fool but surpasses them in many ways. The story picks up some time after where the previous installment left off, and gets more complex, more twisted, and more thrilling.

[ROW 3](https://preview.redd.it/g1ertdfmt6fe1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e388e44e6fa07c161894a1c72e112913eb7e92)

# The Young Elites by Marie Lu

**Dark Academia (HM)**; also disabled, POC author

**Rating:** ★★★

The Young Elites follows Adelina Amouteru, a young girl who survived a blood plague that gave her superpowers and a rather grim outlook on life. It’s a dark story filled with magic, darkness, and more teenage angst than I’ve consumed in any form of media in recent months :) Anyway, if you’re into brooding anti-heroes and dramatic twists, it will probably be right up your alley.

# The Devil By Name by Keith Rosson

**Multi-POV (HM)**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Devil by Name picks up five years after *Fever House* with all the chaos, gore, and gripping drama you’d expect—and then some. The world is still reeling from “The Message,” a weaponized sound that turned much of humanity into bloodthirsty monsters called the fevered. With Terradyne Industries running the show and humanity clinging to survival, the stakes have never been higher.

# Saturation Point by Adrian Tchaikovsky

**Published in 2024 (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

Adrian Tchaikovsky functions at a level of productivity most of us can only envy. A good thing for us, readers. I always thought he excelled at a novella format and Saturation Point proves my point. Fans of a climate apocalypse and existential dread - here’s your next fix.

# Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor

**Disability (HM)**; also First in a Series

**Rating:** ★★★★

*Death of the Author* walks a fine line between literary fiction and Africanfuturism. It’s also a nice example of the book-within-a-book format; we follow the events through Zelu’s life and excerpts from her sci-fi book. I liked how Okorafor shifted between the two genres. And I loved the surprising ending that connected both parts extremely well. But, you know, spoilers.

# The Prestige by Christopher Priest

**Published in the 90s (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Now, I’ve seen The Prestige adaptation and loved it. I wasn’t sure if the novel could still surprise me. The outline of the two versions is similar, but the book has better characterization and sheds more light on Augier’s point of view. It also adds a present-day struggle of Borden and Augier’s descendants. Andrew, for example, feels he has a twin brother, but his birth certificate contradicts it. Is he wrong?

Anyway, if you’ve seen the movie first, you’ll know most big twists. Will it decrease your enjoyment? I can’t promise anything, but it didn’t spoil the fun for me.

Some readers might say The Prestige is a slow burn, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But trust me, every moment of buildup is worth it for the payoff you get in the end. Priest takes his time setting the stage, slowly ratcheting up the tension until it reaches a brilliant climax.

The characterization is simply extraordinary. The strength of the voice is unforgettable.

*The Prestige* is excellent. It tells an unputdownable story of obsession, deception, and blurred boundaries between reality and illusion.

# The Oathsworn Legacy by K.R. Gangi

**Orcs, Trolls, Goblins (HM)**; also First in a Series, Criminals, self-published (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I admit the page count of most SPFBO X’s finalists terrifies me. The Oathsworn Legacy is on the chunkier side, but it reads surprisingly fast. Why? It’s well-written and structured more like a mini-series than a typical novel with a linear progression of the plot.

It’s made of interconnected stories, so instead of a straight shot from start to finish, each “episode” builds on the previous one but focuses on different aspects of the bigger story. Chapters introduce new players (good and evil), deepen relationships and the world. This might throw some readers off, but for me, it worked well. Especially that the characters are one of the strongest parts of the story: well-rounded, memorable, and complex.

# Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh

**Space Opera (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh is a fast-paced, character-driven space opera that won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Not too shabby. While its fans praise the book for its critique of militarism and patriarchy, the intensity of its political messaging felt somewhat heavy-handed to me. Tesh’s writing is sharp, and she delivers a strong commentary on systems of oppression, but the characters can feel more like vehicles for these ideas than fully fleshed-out individuals. That said, I understand those who appreciate Some Desperate Glory’s subversive edge and rather fresh take on classic space opera tropes.

Overall, Some Desperate Glory is a bold, energetic novel with plenty of thought-provoking ideas, but its flaws—unlikable characters, a somewhat repetitive middle, and a too-neat ending—decreased my enjoyment. Still, it’s a noteworthy entry in modern sci-fi that combines thrilling action with larger social critiques.

# The DEAT CAT TAIL ASSASSINS by

**POC Author (HM)**; also Bards, Space Opera, Entitled Animals

**Rating:** ★★★★

It was a wild ride with a breakneck pacing and high fun factor. It surpassed my expectations - I found the mix of action, humor, and some horror refreshing and entertaining. And since it’s a short book, I finished it in no time, really. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled and discreet assassin who plays by the book. She’s also deadly, undead, and wiped off any memories. She accepts a contract but can’t carry it and mayhem ensues.

# Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle

**Survival (HM**); also Eldritch Creatures (HM), Small Town  
**Rating:** ★★★★

What happens when you say “no” to Hollywood execs, dodge AI’s soulless algorithms, and accidentally bring your nightmares to life? In Chuck Tingle’s Bury Your Gays, the answer is a gory, clever, and unexpectedly heartfelt horror romp. Tingle’s writing is tight and unpretentious, with just enough sly humor to offset the tension. The ending sticks the landing, ties up themes of creativity, defiance, and queer resilience with a flourish.

I’m surprised by how much I liked Bury Your Gays. If you like your horror smart, scary, and more than a little meta, it is a must-read.

Audiobook narration: absolutely brilliant.

# Playground by Richard Powers

**Book Cover (HM)**; also Multi-POV (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up Playground. I loved the cover and the premise, but recently I mostly read fast-paced books with lots of action. All easy to enjoy and digest. This one is dense and layered. But it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and left me thinking. Sure, it’s complex and occasionally a little too proud of its own cleverness, but it’s also heartfelt and packed with moments of wonder. Now, I won’t pretend it’s all a smooth reading experience. The novel is dense, sometimes to the point of being intimidating. Powers clashes environmental themes, AI ethics, and human relationships, and while it’s fascinating, it sometimes felt a bit, well, much.

# Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne

**Small Town (HM)**; also Dreams

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A haunted house story with a twist. Diavola takes the genre’s best elements and gives them a snarky, personality-packed makeover. Anna, the narrator, is sharp-tongued and divisive - if her narration clicks with you, you'll have fun. Otherwise, you'll probably DNF it.

# Your Utopia by Bora Chung

**Short Stories (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

Disappointing overall. Thin ideas, solid execution.

# There is No Antimemetics Division by Qntm

**Eldritch Creatures (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

Oh man, what a trip! I heard it was weird, but I didn’t expect this level of weirdness. The Antimemetics Division is one of the SCP departments that deals with ""antimemes."" Huh? Essentially, “antimemes” are information black holes that prevent any knowledge about them from being retained or communicated.

Getting the hang of it requires a lot of mental gymnastics, but once you get past the beginning, everything becomes... Nah. Who am I kidding? It’s dizzyingly complex but also kind of fascinating.

It reads like a unique blend of weird fiction, sci-fi, and cosmic horror, told in a non-linear and scattered way. I found the book fascinating because of its weirdness and cool take on a cosmic horror. Objectively speaking, though, the prose is rather subpar and the characters flat. If you're looking for a great literary experience, this isn't it. If you're here to dig into a very interesting mythos handled uniquely, then you will love this.

Read it for fun and only if you’re okay with being confused most of the time :). 

# The Hidden Guardian By J.D.L Rosell

**Reference Materials (HM);** also arguably Dreams  
Rating: ★★★½

The stakes are higher, the world is bigger, and the action is grander in this third entry of *The Ranger of the Titan Wilds*. Epic fantasy fans will eat this up, but at 711 pages, it’s a bit much for readers like me who prefer tighter narratives.

# The Storm beneath The World by Michael R. Fletcher

**Book Club (HM)**; also Reference Materials HM, First in a Series, Under the Surface, Criminals

Rating: ★★★★½

Fletcher strikes again with this wildly imaginative and entertaining story. It's one of my favorite books of 2024.

# STATS

**Male-authored books:** 18

**Female-authored books:** 7

**Books by POC authors:** 4

**Thoughts:** I could do better in balancing these stats, but ultimately, I chose books that deserved a spot on the card and that I genuinely enjoyed. There are a few obvious exceptions, so I'm all ears if you have recommendations for women-authored books featuring bards, a better Dark Academia (I’ve already read *Blood Over Bright Haven* by M.L. Wang, unfortunately, so I can’t use it) and an anthology (perhaps *Book of the Witches* by Jonathan Strahan, since I already have a copy).

**The book that fits the fewest squares**: The Prestige, I think

**The book that fits the most squares:** ***Navola & Fool's Promise***

# AWARDS

Just for fun, here are some totally made-up and meaningless awards:

* **Best Plot Twist:** *Dig Two Graves* by Craig Schaefer - we finally learn who Paladin is and it's a shocker. But to appreciate it, you need to read the whole series.
* **The ""Did I Just Learn Science"" Award** *Playground* by Richard Powers contains genuine science about oceans and AI.
* **The ""I Will Not Shut Up About This"" Award** *The Storm Beneath The World*, because I think it's criminally underread and not as dark as other books by this author. In other words, give it a chance, it's worth it even if you haven't vibed with his previous stories.
* **Most Confusing Book That Was Worth It**  *There is No Antimemetics Division*. I'm really curious how strongly will it be changed for its traditionally published re-release.
* **Top 5 from the card:** *Navola, The Storm Benath The World, The Prestige, The Empusium, Fool's Promise. With that said, I feel almost all books from this card deserve to be given a chance.*

They will be the 35 x 35 x 35 cm ones, and instead of securing them to the wall, they will be standalone with legs on the bottom.

Despite my aspirations, I cannot find any real information on how to attach and secure the top Eket to the bottom Eket. As far as I can tell, you just put one top of the other, which doesn’t seem very stable to me. Would anyone else on this subreddit know how to do this?

The only three options I can think of that wouldn’t be too visually distracting is if you drill tiny screws up the way from the top of the bottom cube, attach screw railings on the back or use some kind of super sealant and just hope you lined them up properly. I’m just wondering if there’s any better choices that’s not apparent to me.

Attached is a photo from the Ikea website of what I’m basically wanting. Not necessarily the exact same legs.

Ideas I follow.  Inspired by Stoicism.,Stoicism,1i9usqx,2025-01-25 14:26:59,0,0.2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1i9usqx/ideas_i_follow_inspired_by_stoicism/,stoicism-philosophy,Stoicism in Practice,"I'm occasionally asked by friends and colleges what makes me tick.  I tell them about stoicism and some basic ideas I use, but it's hard to give detailed answers during brief interactions.  I decided to write this for future reference and refinement.  I welcome constructive criticism.

1- Train instincts. Psychologists separate consciousness into two parts. The fast mind and the slow mind. The slow mind is the part we think and talk with. The fast mind is what we might call our instincts. Much of psychology involves understanding the fast mind. How it functions and how to use it or treat it appropriately. When discussing the fast mind, keep two important things in mind. First is the fast mind does not think, but instead reacts to stimulus. Second is that our emotions come from the fast mind.

The fast mind cannot be directly influenced by the slow mind. We cannot simply think “I am happy” to make ourselves happy. Nor can we state “I will have perfect reflexes” to dodge attacks. Instead, the fast mind responds to training. Much like our immune system, it's meant to keep us alive. It learns that if X occurs then Y is the response, and the fast mind takes around a fourth of a second to act. Because it reacts so fast, it works using incomplete information. As a result, the fast mind often takes the wrong action. One cannot unlearn reactions, but instead must learn new reactions to override old ones.

The fast mind is often trained incorrectly. Because the fast mind's purpose is to keep us safe, it responds one hundred times stronger to negative reinforcement than to positive reinforcement, so overriding some behaviors requires considerable effort. This is where phobias come from. Weather it's arachnophobia, claustrophobia, or even homophobia and xenophobia. These are irrational fears brought on by an individual's fast mind receiving significant negative reinforcement. Phobia behaviors can be overriden as long as the individual recognizes them as irrational and actively seeks to do so. Nearly always requiring professional assistance using a technique called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, phobias become dangerous when an individual instead tries to rationalize their irrational fears. Often leading to extreme and dangerous beliefs or behaviors.

Once we understand the fast mind responds to training, it becomes possible to train it to great benefit. My favorite example is meditation. Brain scans of master meditators indicate their happiness is unmatched, but learning to quiet one's mind doesn't immediately result in happiness. Instead, it's more accurate to think of meditation as learning to think in emotion. Emotion is part of the fast mind, so one must learn to control it indirectly. Emotions are so fragile, even simple thoughts can break them. Hense the first step being learning to quiet one's mind. The remaining steps cannot be taught. One must literally feel their way through.

A second example of fast mind training are the exercises and sparring matches for martial artists. By drilling the same activities, they train their fast mind to dodge attacks and take advantage of opennings. But because it's a type of positive reinforcement, the training isn't very effective if only done in small amounts. Mastery takes years of hard work. This is true of most fast mind training. It's possible to train faster using negative reinforcement, but the risk of incorrect training greatly increases, so be cautious. Military basic training uses negative reinforcement to great effect. Survival and success in a warzone requires the proper skill set. Outside a warzone, the same skills may be useless or even detrimental and because said behaviors were learned through negative reinforcement, overriding them with positive reinforcement takes one hundred times the effort.

The fast mind is a wonderful tool when applied correctly, but a cruel master when left to it's own devices or treated with abandon.



2- Learn to gift validation to yourself. As children, we instinctively seek out validation from others. The young do not have the life experience required to determine if an action is correct, so they need others to inform them. Praising a child and thanking them for their actions teaches them what actions and behaviors they should pursue.

Seeking out validation continues into adulthood because it is useful when first learning new skills, but it can also lead to one's detriment if mishandled. A constant need for validation implies a lack of confidence or a fear of responsibility. Individuals lacking confidence are rarely trusted to carry out important matters, since they'll often make terrible decisions due to doubt in their own observations. Individuals afraid of responsibility too are not trusted with important matters because they'll allow errors to accumulate and often fixate on specific actions they must follow even if those actions do very little or actively harm the group.

Adults are always on a time limit no matter their objectives and seeking validation takes time away from actually performing. It's amazing just how much a single person can do when they stop working to be noticed and instead work because tasks need doing or for their own satisfaction. The practice will naturally improve one's confidence over time.

There is a downside however. Reward requires recognition. Weather it's one's boss, spouse, or children, the beneficiaries of our actions often fail to recognize anything not done in their own presence. Recognizing the accomplishments of others unprompted, is the companion skill to gifting validation to oneself. Among adults, that skill makes the difference between good and bad leaders. Bad leaders favor their most visible team members even if those people do the least, ostracizing their more productive members. Other team members witness this behavior and correctly put in little effort since their actions are undervalued reguardless. Good leaders go out of their way to see whom is doing what especially when it's not visible, allowing proper appreciation and value placed upon team members. When efforts are properly valued, team members are incentivized to be highly productive. Spouses especially need to recognize one another's actions and accomplishments unprompted or risk a build up of resentment. Those whom fail to recognize anything not done in their own presence are not worthy of loyalty, but if you get stuck with such a person then be sure to remind them of what you do for them and that it's not free, or risk being treated as a slave.

Seek recognition for reward, but gift validation to yourself for your own sake or be at the mercy of the whims of others.



3- Most apologies are not apologies. Apologies for accidents are benign. Two people accidently walking into one another while both are distracted is an honest mistake. However, apologies for deliberate actions have specific intent, but do not always convey genuine regret. Many are instead an attempt to avoid punishment.

As children, most develop a powerful fear of punishment. Without the life experience required to understand the consequences of their actions, children must learn as they go. This is a creature that must be taught to tie it's shoe laces and wipe it's own butt, so don't feel surprised when basic concepts like “actions have consequences” take time to learn. Ideally, parents teach their children how consequences work so the child learns to consider them better. In reality, punishment is an often used out of proportion as a short cut to curb bad behavior since few parents have the time and energy available to act as perfect teachers, but this teaches the child to avoid punishment rather than understand the reasoning for punishment.

Fear of punishment often continues into adulthood, but it's the life experience of adulthood that allows us each to remodel our own behavior and instead come to terms with punishment. Truly accepting our actions have consequences, enables us to more freely take action and live our best life. The 2 best tools I've found to facilitate behavior change are to only apologize when genuinely regretting one's actions, and to accept punishment weather regret is present or not.

Denying ourselves the use of apologies as a means of avoiding punishment forces us to be more honest, more deliberate, and more confident in our actions. This also forces us to see apologies made without regret for what they really are. A lie. Insincere at best and an insult at the worst. Holding others accountable too becomes significantly easier when we don't have to compromise ourselves in the process.

Accepting punishment as a given consequence for egregious actions forces us to carefully consider our options and accept the response should we make perilous, yet vital choices. This makes fighting injustice much easier. Think of protesters using non-violent means like sit-ins to force punishment of their actions to highlight the immoral nature of the laws requiring said punishment. For these, punishment is a badge of honor and not a sign of disgrace.

Through understanding and accepting the consequences of actions, one learns the difference between fear and respect. Fear is a one-sided power dynamic and a fleeting one at that. Fear is only effective as long as it's present and the fearful avoid what they fear. Respect is mutual and doesn't disappear the moment people lose sight of one another, so avoidance is a non-issue.

Through rejecting the fear of punishment, we are freed to pursue respect without hesitation. Both from ourselves and from others. Many won't understand this, but it is they whom must free themselves. Leading me to:



4- Bullies never fight fair, so don't fight them fairly. Weather it's verbal, physical, social, or cyber; bullying must be punished without mercy. While many bullies simply need better guidance, they must learn that actions have consequences or change cannot happen.

In youth, many learn to use disrespect toward authority and outsiders as a means to gain acceptance and social status. Children have constant authority figures in the form of adults, but don't have the experience to truly understand authority itself. To them, authority is simply a thing to be feared. Therefore they learn, being feared and having status are the same thing. This belief invites unnecessary confrontation and violence. It is a rare child that understands respect better than fear. Children bullied by adults integrate the belief that fear and violence are normal even more so, especially if the bullies are their own parents.

Continuing into adulthood, many treat disrespect as a means of attaining respect. Ironic, is it not? In their mind, respect is a finite resource and can only be stolen. In reality, respect is created by offering it and those whom understand respect is meant to be mutual, will give it back freely. Even knowing this, many won't offer respect for fear of being treated with disrespect in turn. However, this is a useful tool for discerning the character of others. Offer respect. If it is returned in kind, then you have a trustworthy partner. If it is treated with disrespect, then you know to revoke all trust and prepare for conflict.

Others might bully out of thoughtlessness, feelings of jealousy, or even outright sadism. Regardless of their reasons, they must learn actions must have consequences or their behavior intensifies.

So how do we defend ourselves? Bullies attack of their victims while unguarded. They don't want a challenge. They want a victim. Fighting one under their conditions is ill-advised unless you've had considerable training to fight back. For the rest, it's better to fight another day. Let them have a win to boost their confidence, then either use that overconfidence against them or attack when their guard is down. Either way, set a trap.

A common trap requires the aid of an authority figure. Tell the authority figure you need their help. Pick a location where the authority figure can be out of sight, then make yourself appear vulnerable to the bully. Once they take the bait, let the authority figure do their thing, but don't be idle. When confronted by authority, bullies usually learn they need to be more stealthy or lie more convincingly. Don't give them the chance. Draw attention. Ask specific bystanders to weigh in on what's happening. Describe in detail the bully's egregious actions publicly. Do not allow punishment to only happen behind closed doors even if the authority figure tries to keep it that way. Ruin the bully's reputation. It's the only thing they value. Once they are subdued, confront them with their actions. Show no mercy. They must be made to understand this is their own fault or they'll blame their victim instead and seek revenge. Don't accept a verbal apology. Tell them if they're truly sorry, they'll need to prove it with their actions. What those actions are, you and the bully must determine together. If no deal can be reached, get them permanently removed by whatever means necessary.

You'll find many businesses have policies against using humiliation as punishment. This makes sense because it can be easily abused, but that doesn't change the fact it's the most effective form of non-violent punishment. Especially if the bully in question is an authority figure. Don't be afraid to call people out publicly. In fact, bring as much attention as you can. In my youth for example, I had a terrible boss that I'll refer to as the gossip queen. She talked about everyone behind their back, including the group of 3 friends she hired to work with her. Keeping others from trusting one another was how she hid her lack of skill and lazy work ethic. On one particular occasion, I happen to walk past her bad mouthing another manager to a new manager and I brought up some good qualities of the absent manager. The gossip queen later tried to talk to me alone and asked me not to interupt manager meetings. I laughed in her face as loud as a could, so other staff could hear. “Manager meeting? Ahahahaha. Is that what you call your gossip sessions? Do you think I actually care what you say about everyone behind their backs? You even do it to the ones that think you're their friend. I'm going back to work now. Hahahaha.” Her 3 friends were gone the next day. She quit soon after when no one would work with her.

Sadism is a different beast all together. Fear of authority does not work on the sadist. They see authority as a tool to be manipulated through well crafted lies. They must either be caught and punished to the degree you never need worry about them again or they must learn to fear you as an individual to the degree they avoid you completely. They want victims, not opponents. If you are not capable of behaving cruelly to this person then you can only be the victim of them. Learn to be cruel when required. Be a monster and keep it reigned in until necessary. I will not mince my words. The world is a better place when sadists are locked up or buried.

Accept actions have consequences and conquer the fear of punishment. Understand the reasons and meanings for punishment, to appropriately deal it. Punishment rarely needs to be excessive, but there are times when mercy is a luxury.



5- The forty percent rule. Credit to David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL, for sharing the idea. When the mind tells us we're exhausted and can't go on, we're actually only about 40% done. We can do so much more, but we have to push past the point of discomfort. As we strive to push ourselves further, our mind adapts and we can push to 45%, then 50%. The reverse is also true. Those whom never push themselves reduce to 35%, then 30%. Perseverance pays off.

The forty percent rule isn't meant to be used constantly however. That point of exhaustion exists to protect our bodies from injury. Be cautious.

Whenever I find myself at that point of discomfort, but know I need to keep going, I say to myself “Fuck it, keep going.”"

Codebase became too complex. Any way to re-gain kownledge over it with Cursor?,cursor,1i9ub51,2025-01-25 14:05:55,3,0.67,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1i9ub51/codebase_became_too_complex_any_way_to_regain/,ButterscotchWeak1192,,"I am working on side project, which I started via manual coding half a year ago, and greatly upgraded it over span of last month, thanks to Cursor.   
  
However because of rapid pace, and mostly relying on Composer for adding basically everything using English as my coding language, I nearly completely lost an idea of how my app works, what functions and data structures are used within it, and what's the general flow between functions when I use some feature.

  
My question:  
1) How do you regain knowledge about your codebase, meaning: what is the internal flow, what button/funciton calls what and when.   
2) Any idea on how could I visualize this flow? Like, if I asked Cursor something like ""user clicks button X on UI. What is the flow"", how could I get Cursor to visualise this to me, as in what files, functions and data structures get used? Cursor can't draw obviously.  
3) Any protips on avoiding this state in first place? This is especially hard for me to plan ahead, since when I'm experimenting, I usually don't know where I'm heading. But I will gladly listen.

So overall Cursor helps me pushing my ideal into code - something I wouldn't have time or will to do manually, programming the old way.

But it also kind of rips me off priviledge of learning. I don't know very well how my app is constructed. For me it's not only about regaining (some) control over my app, but also an opportunity to actually learn how my app is constructed. This is for those of you who wish to comment that I should learn about patrerns and architecture first."
ADHD and chronic pain,adhdwomen,1i9u8tu,2025-01-25 14:03:14,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i9u8tu/adhd_and_chronic_pain/,Hairy-Vacation-1874,Rant/Vent,"I got diagnosed with ADHD a couple of months ago. I started Concerta yesterday in an effort to help with that. 

My whole life, I’ve struggled with chronic pain. My left arm/shoulder give me hell every day I try to do something with my hands. This pain makes my fingers numb and makes my back/neck hurt as well. I’ve searched for answers for my pain forever, but all the doctors say I just need to live with it. CT scans, X-rays, physical therapy, chiropractors, pain meds, you name it. 

For context, I’m a music education major. I started with piano as my main instrument. I quickly realized that the intensity of being a college pianist isn’t possible. Anything that uses finger/hand strength hurts. In my second semester, I switched to being a vocalist (wasn’t a hard switch, I’ve been singing as long as I’ve been alive) and it was heartbreaking. Piano was my dream. I wanted to be a concert pianist. My body ripped it away from me. 

I’m a senior now. I’ve completed my senior recital and I need to take guitar lessons to complete my degree. Over the past 4 years, I’ve been able to accommodate my pain. I try to take it easy but also stay somewhat active. It hurts when I stand for too long, but otherwise manageable most days. 

It’s week two of lessons, and I haven’t practiced much. I get distracted, can’t focus, make careless mistakes, all that. I started Concerta yesterday, and it was awesome. I practiced for 30 minutes straight, and learned 3 new chords. Then I went and practiced piano as well (taking accompaniment lessons, not performance lessons) and then wanted to practice vocal jazz, but it hurt to be upright by then. I had to lay down while the last effects of my meds wore off. 

I was frustrated. But I thought maybe I could push through it. Today is day 2 of taking meds. I wanted that guitar high again, so about 30 minutes after taking my meds I tried to practice. 

The 3 chords I learned yesterday were still in my head. But then I tried C major. This chord specifically caused me major shooting pains and numbness. I didn’t get 5 minutes into practicing before I broke down. 

I thought my life would change once I got medicated, and to be fair it could have. My brain is finally so ready to be productive and work for once. But my body can’t keep up. 

I can’t even describe this feeling. I’ve felt it before when I had to quit piano. Devastation? Disappointment? Frustration? Probably all of those.

My whole life, I’ve had all these roadblocks because of my mind and my body. I guess I forgot that even though my mind is functional doesn’t mean my body is. I feel trapped in this body, because it prevents me from doing the thing I love most: music. Any other passion may have been better. 

I have all this motivation and desire to complete any one task. But I CANT. 
 
Has anyone else experienced this? I feel so alone. My husband also has ADHD so he has been happy for my journey to get help but he doesn’t understand the pain. I guess I just needed to rant. I can’t do anything else."

“Smallest” infinite series,calculus,1i9tq6l,2025-01-25 13:41:06,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/calculus/comments/1i9tq6l/smallest_infinite_series/,Rich-Guest,Infinite Series,"So I've been messing around with divergent integrals and have 1/x and the harmonic series and ln(x). Then I saw the theorem that there's no smallest infinite series because you just keep taking the ln to make it smaller. So firstly, does that apply to the harmonic series. I can't see how bc ln(1) + ln(1/2)+... goes to negative infinity. I went on wolfram alpha and got the series 1/(xln(x)) based off the derivative of ln(ln(x)) which seems to make sense. Is that correct?

Secondly and I think more interesting. I think it's fair to assume that an infinite amount of nested ln(x) functions like ln(ln(ln(...))) would be the ""smallest"". If you call it Fn(x) with n being the amount of ln functions, then the zero is e^(n-1). So then woukdnt the zero of Fn(x) as n-> infinity become e^(infinity), meaning it never goes positive, meaning it doesn't go to infinity. This shit is messy. Somebody please help. Also if you take the series the way I described like 10 seconds ago you get 1/(a shit ton of undefined ln(0)) so how does that work"

Hey! I’m looking for a romance roleplay based around the concept of a masked-hero with alter egos. I am a HUGE fan of superheroes who have struggles defending their identities to keep them and their loved ones safe, which causes even more problems for the character in their private life. This is my absolute favourite trope in superhero comics, my favourite example of it being Spider-Man. I would love to do this trope in a romance roleplay! I have an idea for this, but I would rather send it in a dm since it’s relatively dependant on which character I will use. There are just a couple things I would be interested in, and I will list them below!

- I really want this to be Civilian (my character) x Super (your character)

- Villains are allowed too! If I can feel like our characters seem fitting enough, a character with a villain alter ego would be very cool!

- I prefer LGBTQ+ pairings, but that doesn’t mean that MxF isn’t allowed. I just have a huge preference for MxM or FxF.

- I would LOVE a roleplay where there is a relationship with both the hero and the alter ego with my character (maybe even a love triangle with them lol). Being able to have two seperate relationships with seperate egos of the same character seems to be a very fun idea, and I would love to be able to do it.

- I am most comfortable with the Marvel universe, but I’m perfectly fine with a DC setting! Doing something like a roleplay in Gotham seems like it could be really fun and interesting! Causing many bits of drama due to the villains and crime in it.

- canon characters are allowed, but I prefer OCs

That’s all I have right now, so please send a DM if you’d like to give this a shot!"
Fantasy-Romance RP!!,roleplaying,1i9tnnd,2025-01-25 13:38:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1i9tnnd/fantasyromance_rp/,Starr-knot,🔎 Partner Search,"

Hey! I was looking for a roleplay which was mainly slice of life and romance mixed in with elements from the fantasy genre! 
I would absolutely love to have a story where there we can have a cutesy roleplay in a world where we can explore the many opportunities for world building and character writing that a fantasy world has to offer. 

I don’t quite have very many ideas, but I have a couple of things I’d like in the rp + a basic plot idea.
Firstly, I am very leant towards LGBTQ+ ships! I’m not against straight ships, but I just find that LGBTQ+ ships are much more enjoyable, so I’ll be more inclined to do MxM or FxF, or something involving any gender identities and sexualities (trans friendly :>).
secondly, I usually prefer a minimum of one paragraph per response (occasional responses where it’s less is alright, I totally understand that life can be stressful and doing less is totally fine on occasion as long as I have something to work with). 
And finally, I am quite flexible to write with, so any breaks/hiatuses are perfectly fine as long as I have notice so I’m not thinking that I am being ghosted! 

Now onto my plot idea: 
My idea is that there is a renowned college that has one of the greatest educational programs out there for anyone of any species. It isn’t quite known by the general public and is quite exclusive to some of the most known families and clans, so only the top students are accepted into it. Our ocs can meet through that, and slowly become friends, then lovers. For tropes, I’ve been CRAVING a scholar (MC) x bully (YC) or even a scholar (MC) x rebel/delinquent (YC), but I’m open to any ideas that you have! 

Don’t be afraid to share any plot ideas that you have! Nothing is set in stone, I just wanted a plot set in a world that is like earth but has a lot of fantasy elements too. I do have a preference for monster-y/non-human characters, but again it isn’t a need or anything.

Please send a DM if you’re interested! I have an idea in particular for an angsty MxM romance lol"
Is there a relation to capital pi and a factorial?,askmath,1i9tmay,2025-01-25 13:36:20,1,0.54,12,https://i.redd.it/72comwtcp6fe1.jpeg,Ok-Security-1260,Calculus,"Thinking about it feels like capital pi is reverse factorial in a way because in one you can have 5! = 5x4x3x2x1. And in the other you can have 1x2x3x4x5. I recently found out about capital pi so forgive me if this is very odd or elementary (or both lol) and i feel like some of it is because I feel like I’m using it improperly (that I’ll just ask my teacher about on Monday, that’s not really something that I’ll necessarily ask about here, just on desmos it’s giving me different answers than what I’m putting in). However, when I put x! (Gamma function) and

I meant something else but It does seem like there is some sort of relation."
"Should I push for a biopsy? Hard, painless lymph node and decreased appetite.",DiagnoseMe,1i9tcrr,2025-01-25 13:24:44,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1i9tcrr/should_i_push_for_a_biopsy_hard_painless_lymph/,BoringBeing2012,Infections and Illnesses,"35F, 136 lbs, 5'11""

**I found a mass on the right side of my neck over 5 weeks ago**. It is **hard and painless**. This was an incidental finding as I was having a thyroid biopsy the next morning and was looking at my multinodular goiter when I noticed it (biopsy came back fine). 

I had my annual telehealth with my doctor 3 weeks later and mentioned it to her as it had not went down or changed. She said that she would order an ultrasound for it. I had an ultrasound the next week and they reported a **2 cm lymph node with surrounding lymph nodes that were swollen that measured 1.3 cm**. It said the larger lymph node **could be reactive but neoplastic process is not excluded**. I was then sent for a CT (it was done about 3 days later). CT showed exactly what the ultrasound said 2 cm lymph node with surrounding lymph nodes measuring 1.3 cm. It added that the **lymph node was benign looking**. 

I asked my doctor if the CT was the final test or did I still need a biopsy? She said that she would speak with a pathologist about a possible biopsy. Mainly because **I have lost my appetite and I've lost weight**. I'm nearly underweight now. I've also had this odd feeling in my chest recently like something is in my chest. She **ordered me to get a chest X-ray (I got that yesterday, they said it came back fine)**. Anyway, she told me the **pathologist thinks based on the CT, biopsy is not needed**. But he wants me to repeat a thyroid ultrasound even though I just had a biopsy on a thyroid nodule (I think we've figured out this is moot). 

My biggest issue with all this (and I have brought this up to my doctor) is that **not ONE medical professional had laid one finger on this lymph node(s)** and felt it for themselves. They are just saying yep, it's fine even though it's rock solid which is worrisome. So I had issue with everyone making conclusions about the node without actually feeling of it. 

Well, they messaged me yesterday and told me I could come in and have an NP feel the node. She did, she said **it's moveable so that's a good sign**. She wants to try steroids to see if the inflammation goes down and if it doesn't they are going to bring me back in to try more panels (Lyme disease, mono, Epstein-Barr virus are specific tests she mentioned). 

My issue with the steroids is that everything I've read said that **steroids should not be used for swollen lymph nodes if the cause is unknown**. Because steroids with reduce the inflammation in the lymph nodes and you are left with having no idea what infected it (or if it is still there). You have the opportunity to figure it out now while the lymph node is enlarged. 

About one month into all this testing, I came down with the flu. I'm better now but I have a horrible cough that I cannot kick. Other than this, I have not been sick in 6 months or longer. 

Some things to note: **my blood work for my annual came back fine** except for my kidney function which is always kind of off (maybe due to kidney stones, creatinine is high and eGFE is on the lower side-71). My doctor checks my thyroid levels every year but it has never been off in my lifetime. **My goiter was found in 2018**. 

I don't know when advocating for myself is too much and when I should just give in. Something doesn't feel right (mainly because I'm not eating) but I'm all about respecting doctors and any position that I am not an expert in. But I do feel like I know my body. Are they on the right path? **Should I push for a biopsy?** Would it tell me more? Should I hold off on the steroids? Any advice would be helpful.

"[32M] I have Tetralogy of Fallot and by all accounts, im doing great. Am I just lucky? MRI results included too.",AskDocs,1i9t95k,2025-01-25 13:20:29,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i9t95k/32m_i_have_tetralogy_of_fallot_and_by_all/,hexcodehero,,"32, 163lbs, 5'9""

So I know TOF is so niche, some docs are fascinated by it and want to hear my murmur haha..

I had an initial repair, by a surgeon who must have been incredible. Then finally I received a pulm. valve in college. That was about 12 years ago now.

I recently got a cardiac MRI, and from a layperson the numbers look pretty good. The strange thing is you can see my pulmonary flow is Definity imbalanced, however my doc said that could be due to my past surgery / body adapting because my cardiac anatomy is very different than normal hearts. He is gonna schedule a follow up test to make sure of that.

I am asymptomatic, play sports, run etc. I played sports my entire life, and live in NYC so im always on the move. I realize that things can go wrong as I get older, but looking at this MRI I feel pretty damn lucky about this. How does this MRI look from your perspective, consider I have a congenital heart disorder? Doctors are miracle workers and the surgeons are incredible at this.

Exam: MRI CARDIAC C+/C- Jan 22 2025 12:34PM   CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUTCONTRAST  INDICATION: Tetralogy of Fallot, Right aortic arch, Aberrant   left subclavian artery, s/p VSD patch, transannular RVOT repair,  b/L PA plasty, PDA ligation (1994)   2013, August 8: S/P RV-PA conduit change with 25 mm Carpentier-Edwards   Magna Bovine pericardial valve   COMPARISON: MRI 2013 (pre-op)   Ht:174 cm Wt:74 kg BSA:1.9 m2 (Haycock)   
_________________________________________

TECHNIQUE: MRI without and with contrast material was obtained.  In addition to the necessary localizers, steady-state free precession  cine images were performed in the axial, right ventricular outflow   tract, left ventricular outflow tract, short axis, two chamber,   four chamber, aortic valve planes to evaluate regional and global   ventricular function. Phase contrast images were performed at   the level of ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery, right pulmonary   artery, left pulmonary artery. After the uneventful administration  of 7 ml of IV gadolinium, a 3D ellipticocentric MRA was performed.   Late gadolinium enhancement  imaging were performed after 10 minutes, images were obtained   in short axis, two chamber and four chamber planes using 2 D   phase sensitive inversion recovery sequences.

The right atrium is normal, qualitatively.  Normal right ventricular size and with normal global systolic   function.   Mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unobstructed right ventricular outflow tract.  Trivial-mild pulmonary regurgitation.   Flow artifact noted across the pulmonary valve. Peak gradient   across it \E   E\18 mm Hg (correlate with echocardiographic findings)   Differential pulmonary blood flow is RPA:38% LPA:62%  The pulmonary arteries measure (short axis from MRA):  Right pulmonary artery: proximal: 19 mm x 21 mm, distal 26 mm  x 28 mm   Left pulmonary artery: proximal: 17 mm x 15 mm, distal 26 mm   x 27 mm   Normal left ventricular size and with normal global systolic  function.   No asymmetric thickening of the left ventricle.  

No convincing foci of late gadolinium enhancement.   

Unobstructed left ventricular outflow tract.  No significant mitral or aortic regurgitation.   Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery.

Why Ukraine is the turning point for humanity and what must be done,ClimaticConsequences,1i9t7hw,2025-01-25 13:18:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimaticConsequences/comments/1i9t7hw/why_ukraine_is_the_turning_point_for_humanity_and/,CFUsOrFuckOff,,"This is not a political position, but a thermodynamic one. The world is heading from a time of excess to a time of scarcity. With more people enjoying fewer comforts, humanity is faced with the direction it takes for the rest of our species' future on this planet and others: we can't fight each other for what's left  or we can share with each other what we need.

This isn't - or has never before been - a serious question because this world has never felt universal hardship before. In the past, when any major scarcity  was faced (with the exception of 536) there was always a neighboring ally to buffer the loss or an enemy to subjugate; until now, there has always been more. Climate change is a global pressure on a globalized economy. There are no external economies that are thriving to prop up the luxuries we've come to feel entitled to. When that luxury can no longer be provided, people are trained to blame each other and ask for the boss to complain about our level of service. 


This is the attitude fueling the shift to the right ""all this liberal 'science' bullshit has turned my country into a place i dont recognize.  Time to get my country in order!"", but like how the long term side effects of COVID will be blamed on the vaccine rather than the virus, humans are apparently hardwired to look for a person or institution that's responsible for their problems, because they live in a world that's manifestly run by humanity. Politicians don't help with this because they promise change that a large bureaucracy isn't capable of... every time they step in front of a mic. Politicians feed the sense that the world is divided into teams and the team that's running things is doing harm. They are the anti-vax evangelists of a world simply running out of good time as a result of spending all the good time since the end of WWII. 

Humanity cannot fly. That shouldn't be arguable. It's a fundamental limit of our physiology that cannot be overcome without shedding everything about us that makes us human; brains are heavy. When we get on a plane, we are not 'flying', we are taking a bus full of people, strapping a rocket engine to it, and firing it in a ballistic trajectory toward our destination. For all the celebration of progress in the tech age, we still can't figure out how to move something forward without throwing something out the back. That's not just why planes are absurd but why they cannot continue to be considered a good invention. Think of how much fuel would need to be burned to rocket yourself across a lawn, let alone through the sky; it's an insane amount of fuel and an absurd justification for burning it, especially virtually all domestic travel can be accomplished by rail or bus... which also use the same principle of throwing out enough exhaust gasses out the back to displace the weight of the thing that's burning the fuel. When this thing is on the ground, it burns much less fuel than pushing it through the sky. 

Humanity assumes novelty is benign.  Im not sure if this is one of the hidden rules about capitalism that we all follow as a culture ""have you seen the new x!? It's amazing and works way better than x-1!"", or if we're evolutionarily programmed to assume new is good and the direction we should be heading in. In either case, it has allowed us to adopt planetary destruction as a necessary aspect of each of our lives. It isn't anything we do consciously, it is the background of our lives that feeds big industry and steals time from the future. It's our commute, our food, our total acceptance that running a furnace is fine despite getting all worked up about oil spills and fires when we see them uncontained. The maze we all run was designed to have as much distance as possible between you and the cheese at the end so you would spend half or more of your cheese burning calories to get from the start to the finish and repeat all over. It is why people feel the problem is too big for them: there is nothing one person can change in the part of the life they control that will redirect the planetary system away from collapse because it is the pattern of our lives that is the destructive part. 


Since our shared pattern is so destructive, it is self limiting. We are feeling the effects of that now with COVID (forests being pushed toward ecological breakdown leads animals to look for new territory and new food, leading to conflict with species already there and malnutrition from food with an incomplete nutrient balance), extreme weather doing damage to vital infrastructure and shipping losses. 

Which brings us back to Ukraine. The world needs a beacon. A Western country with the courage to model a sustainable lifestyle through active change. I assumed that would have been Canada but I was wrong. Instead, with Ukraine being forced to rebuild in a time where supplies have never been more expensive, and in a state where its people have gotten used to living without luxury, it can either be an incubator for redesigning human life to restore the environment rather than destroy it.

There is no stronger people to take on such a challenge and the world that has been paying for weapons to defend. If we can send explosives to break, we must send hands, tools, and materials to rebuild. If we rebuild the same way, the world will fall into war since the causal push of all existing conflict is space and resources or their control, and we will continue to pretend that individual human choices are to blame for war. We will continue to refuse to look deeper and will soon find ourselves in a position where taking up arms seems like the only solution left to us. If, on the other hand, the rest of us find the courage to look one step deeper and ask ""why is the world falling to war? What is driving conflict?"", we will see it is the same thing driving our thirst for more luxury and, hopefully,  realize that the only survivable path to the future is one where we change our behavior to relieve the force that's pushing us in that direction.

 When more is never enough, less is a horrifying concept. Without a model for how to happily live as a human in a self sufficient community, there will be no ""green transition"", there will only be more disease, more scarcity, and more conflict on the edge of that scarcity. The more each of us takes, the more we contribute to conflict around the world. 

There is no way to make a car ""green"", just like there is no way to make a compostable battery. The problem isnt the means of conveyance, it is the distance we need to cover to survive. Whether or not we change our habits to adapt to this reality is inconsequential to its eventuality, it just seems absurd to ignore the reality of hardship until you're being strangled by it simply to ""enjoy the time you have left"".

If the war in Ukraine ends and the world moves in to turn it into the first net zero country, there is hope for a future for our species. If we act like everything was fine until a mad man decided to invade a sovereign country, war will spread like a fog descending on the world. Demands will be met by force as a result of people pushing for impossibly cheap access to resources. Slavery will return as the foundation of the global economy and, in all this horror, we will be hastening and worsening our own conditions. 

Like a train whose tracks go over the grand canyon, humanity needs one last train stop to see what it looks like to live somewhere other than a train at constantly increasing speed. We need a model for a future that is too nebulous to explain: it must be seen and experienced, how much living can be done as humans on and with the land. If nothing else but to illustrate that a train going over a cliff was not a predetermined consequence of ""human progress"", and that a choice has been made to define that progress with the inventions of a few men, all of which run by stealing energy from the past and stability from the future. It would allow us to see the train from the outside and force us to question the value of a murder-suicide pact. 

For the demonstration to be compelling, there can be no or very little carbon footprint for the country. Structures must be built from salvaged (cheap) material, focusing on isolated but functional communities. 

We have already lost the battle to save most of what we recognize in our world but we don't need to continue to burn it all down. Since there is no more track for this paradigm, there is no consequence for trying something new and certain death and misery by doing the same. This message can be shared in every possible way, but without a demonstration of what it looks like on a cultural level, we will never have the discussion that leads to the choice to keep going or get off the death train.

We are not the creations or technology we obsess over, we are an ape descended species on a planet we're stuck with and have killed 80% of in 50 years. We cannot survive on a lifeless world because we are alive and life feeds on life to survive. I have a hard time getting people to relate to the rest of the living world as a branch of the same tree we belong to because of how separated we are from other life. The more life that's lost, the less we'll care about it being gone and the more committed we will be to our preoccupations to avoid having to face reality. 

The cowardice ive encountered when it comes to facing reality has been incredibly disappointing and disturbing. We will pass laws in our country to prevent poaching and hunting in other countries where our emissions and lifestyle -guided by our laws- are pushing the same animals to total extinction. We will talk about this from a position of moral superiority, only, and will take no responsibility for the conditions our behavior has already created. There is no ""border crisis"", there are people being pushed out of their homes by new weather that has made those homes incompatible with survival. I've heard lots of Americans talking about moving north in response to climate shifts as if that is something completely different from what is happening on their southern border or in Europe. No one leaves their ancestral home to cause problems in another country, but if that country is responsible for the force that pushed them out, they should either stop pushing people out of their homes or open their borders. To refuse either is to accept that you live a life of evil and as the person that will one day deny you shelter to protect what they have.

These a new times with new stakes and new bad guys. The only good thing about being the bad guy is you can choose to stop, while your victims can only beg you to stop and, eventually, resist/insist on a different course. It is up to each and all of us how the future plays out. The party is over. No one gets to sit this out."

**Memory Transcription Subject: Leasha, flustered owner of Twilight Pupcare** 

**Date \[Standardized Human Time\] October 28, 2136** 

*Stars above, give me strength for I have not thought this through.*  

How did I ever think I could survive this? Trapped in an enclosed room with him, and overnight as well! My mind invariably went to all the most inappropriate places as our proximity to one another stirred a warmth within my body. Even sitting down, he was much taller than me, and I couldn’t help but imagine him simply leaning over my way, pinning me beneath his perfectly sculpted body.  

More and more the desire to feel the firm musculature of his body grew in me. Sure, I may have received a very intimate hug from him after the shadestalker attack, but I was too much of an emotional wreck at the time to really savor the sensation and commit it to memory. The best I had was a foggy recollection of what it felt like, and I wanted more than that. 

I couldn’t work up the nerve to come out and request it, or even just do it, though. George had been extremely focused as he scrolled through page after page of information on his personal device for nearly the last claw, looking for some way to get back at the exterminators and convince them it was better to just let the pups go. This was not the time for my wild and untamed thoughts to be left rampant. I had to restrain them and focus on the task at hand. 

While I turned my attention back to my own personal device, George let out a frustrated sigh bordering on a growl. “I can only understand like half of this shit that I’m reading right now and the rest of it is just a bunch legal jargon that seems to be there entirely for bureaucratic bloat! How is it that on an alien world the legal system is still a tangled mess of knots?” 

“Maybe it’s because society itself is complicated? We can’t give up hope just yet, though. There has to be some way we can take action against the exterminators without giving them the opportunity to arrest us for it.” 

George considered for a second, his face doing all sorts of weird movements that I had yet to get used to. It struck me just how expressive a human’s face is. All those tiny muscles twitching and moving in subtle ways that were impossible for me to decipher.  

*Is this what humans feel when they look at our tail signs?*  

Bizarre methods of communication aside, eventually George just shook his head and chuckled. “You know, it’s funny. I spent my whole life following the rules, trying not to cause problems for other people, just being your average run of the mill Joe. Now, I’m actively trying start trouble and looking for ways to get away with it. Weird how things turn out.” 

That was a feeling I could relate to. “You’re telling me. I never imagined my life would become so chaotic. I thought I’d spend my days taking care of the pups in the peace and quiet of the herd. Being forced out of the herd, labeled an outcast and looked at like I’m some kind of PD case after losing all the pups...”  

The more I talked, the more it hurt until eventually I couldn’t say another word. Never have I felt so alone before as the very people who once greeted me with a happy tail wave now sneered at me with revulsion. It was as if I was no different than an Arxur, or perhaps closer to a human, in their eyes. 

I didn’t even realize that there were tears in my eyes until George put an arm around my shoulder to comfort me, dragging me back to reality from my spiraling thoughts. “Hey, Leasha, it will be alright. We’ll get the kids back, get your business back up and running, and eventually everything will go back to normal. The thing about irrational fears is that the more you’re exposed to it, the more you realize that there was nothing to be worried about to begin with.” 

Lately it felt like he was reassuring me more often than I was him, despite the fact he had nearly the whole galaxy against him and his species. A scoff escaped me. “You know, I never thought the day would come when I would consider a predator species to have more empathy than my own. It’s laughable, really.” 

George looked concerned, if I was reading his expression right, and contemplative for a few moments. Eventually I saw a grin spread across his face. “You know what helps chase away those dark clouds?” He reached over and snatched a bowl of food from the table. “Snack foods!” 

It was so ridiculous and out of nowhere that I could help but laugh at it. George’s smile grew a bit as the dark clouds were chased away by the shining soul within this colossal man. I took the offered snack, a thin, wavy flake that I hadn’t tried yet, and popped it into my mouth. It was deliciously salty and crunchy, the combination doing wonders for my mood. 

“Well, I can’t deny it, you were right.” 

He laughed and ate one of the flakes himself. “Potato chips are a dangerously comfortable food. You immediately feel better after eating them, but they’ll bloat you like crazy if you’re not careful.” 

“All the best things carry a cost, don’t they?” 

“True enough,” he stated simply as we both munched on the snacks. He put the bowl down and let out a short huff. “I know we’re on an important mission right now and the kids need our help, but frankly my brain is feeling like mush after reading all that legal jargon and you seem like you need an emotional break as well. What say you to watching a movie before getting back to it?” 

“A movie?” He wanted to watch a movie with me, we are eating snacks, and we were in his apartment together, alone... 

*Is this a date!?*  

My mind leapt at the thought, practically doing a flip of joy as I tried to reign myself in. This was a very serious situation and the pups needed our help. I am their caretaker, and I couldn’t be sitting around watching movies with a muscular human no matter how much it made my tail wag with joy. Speaking of which, I forced my tail down against the seat to still it. 

“Are you sure now’s the best time for that?” 

He shrugged. “I honestly can’t tell you for certain. The only thing I know is that forcing yourself to do something beyond the tolerance of your mind can do more harm than good. You might miss a crucial detail, an obvious solution, or just plain demoralize yourself before you can even act. We’ll do one movie and then get back to work once we’re refreshed and ready to look at things with a clean slate.” 

*Just do it you coward! You have to take this chance; don’t let it slip away!*  

That fire deep within me was being stirred again, prompting me to action with its burning heat that pulsed deep within my chest. It almost felt like I wasn’t even in control of myself anymore as a force beyond me guided my actions. 

“Well, if you think that it’s alright for us to take a break right now, then I guess I have no reason to object.” 

He gave me a smile and a nod as he got up from his seat, collecting the controller for his room’s entertainment system. When he turned on the system, a screen was displayed with a large collection of unfamiliar titles featuring humans on the cover. I never had any need for a visual translator, so I didn’t have that functionality and could not read any of the names being presented before me. George seemed to have an idea of the type of movie he wanted to play, however. 

“Well, knowing you and your taste of media, I’d say a romcom would be a good pick.” 

Despite me knowing better at this point, I still felt a small bit of nervousness at the hence unheard-of category of movie he decided on. He said it would suit my tastes, but even so a part of me was worried that there was a significant cultural rift present. 

“Uhm, what exactly is a romcom?” 

“Oh, it’s shorthand for romantic comedy. The plots for these types of movies usually boil down to budding romantic interest interjected with a few hijinks and jokes that usually slow down or get in the way of the love interest.” 

That... sounded pretty fun, actually. He messed around with the settings on the list, mumbling a bit to himself about filters and a few complaints about user friendliness before he finally got his selections listed. I was quite surprised to see how extensive the list actually was with dozens of movies being available. It almost seemed like humans had just as many movies about romance as we did. I’m sure the exterminators would have just labeled it all as predatory deception and declared that they were all just empty titles with no actual content or perhaps vicious predatory concepts of love like sharing fresh kills with a mate... 

*Humans don’t do that, right?*  

Finally, he decided on one, clicking the controller to start it as he sat back down next to me. While it was sweet that he chose this genre for me, it was well known that he was not nearly as much of a fan of it as I was. 

“Are you really sure you want to watch this kind of movie with me? I mean, it’s nice of you to consider my preferences, but if you don’t like them, then we could watch something else.” 

He waved a hand in front of his face. “Nah, it’s fine. Romcoms aren't bad or anything, and they’re fun every once and a while, it’s just the plot gets predictable after so many times.” 

Well, I guess he had a bit of a point. In the back of your mind, you always do know what will happen to the protagonists of those stories. It’s not like they would just end a story without the emotional payoff of the characters finally getting together. Even so, it’s always romantic and tickles that part of me that longs for a mate as loyal and caring as that. 

*You mean like the one in front of you?* 

*Shut up! Not now!*  

Despite the ever-present voice in my head that was constantly goading me on, I controlled myself and focused on the movie as it went through the opening sequence. It was interesting. I got a glimpse of life on the human home world and a variety of the half-predators wandered about in a town not too dissimilar to that of shady hills. They came in all shapes, sizes, and even pigmentations as they did decidedly normal activities such as shopping, driving, playing in the park with their pups, and working. Sure, the many binocular eyes on display were slightly unsettling, but none of them looked directly into the camera so the quantity wasn’t overwhelming in the slightest, unlike when I first entered the shelter and every human we passed couldn’t take their eyes off me. 

The two apparent protagonists were introduced separately, though evidently working in the same location as one another if I was picking up the correct context clues as they rushed about, busy as a laysi in flower field. These two humans eventually collided with one another in the halls of their business, both of them dropping some items in the process. They knew each other in passing and had a professional relationship it seemed as they talked while picking things up. I wasn’t familiar with human signs of attraction, but there may have already been a little spark between them from what I was picking up.  

I will readily admit that I was quickly getting invested in their relationship. For some reason the plot felt a little familiar to me as well. It was also interesting to see how humans went about establishing a relationship with one another, even when the depth of said relationship is strained due to outside circumstances.  

There was one particular argument scene near the midpoint of the movie that was scary as it was fascinating to witness. The two protagonists were yelling at each other for a few minutes, airing their grievances and problems in a frightening manner. I had thought that maybe it would be the end of the couple, but by the time they finished shouting, the pair became calm, almost tranquil as they fell into a deep contemplation over their circumstances and budding feelings. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I was enraptured by it. 

George, on the other paw, wasn’t as invested as I was. During the quieter scenes I caught him scrolling through his personal device again, looking through more of the legal notes for a few minutes until something else in the movie managed to capture his attention once more. It was a little disappointing that he wasn’t more engaged with the story and watching it with me. I wanted this to be a more personal moment between us. 

*You could give him a little hint.*  

The voice was back, feeding wondrously troublesome ideas into my head once more. Just the thought of doing something suggestive made my heart start racing and my face feel like it was burning. Thankfully, and frustratingly, George wasn’t paying much attention to me at the moment, so my embarrassment went unnoticed.  

Looking up at the big man as he so obliviously altered between watching the movie and scrolling through his device filled me with such agonizing vexation. It was eating away at me like a predator, running amok inside my mind and my body as I felt my tail twitch with the need to act. The burden of desire grew too great for me, and I caved under the pressure as slowly my tail shifted over the surface of the couch until it brushed against his thigh.  

I was so embarrassed by my actions and fearful of the response they would elicit that I couldn’t even bring myself to look at him for the first few seconds as I gently shifted the tip of my tail back and forth across his well-toned thigh. After a moment, though, when nothing happened or no words of protest came from him, I ventured to sneak a peek at his face. What I saw confused me. 

His face was neutral, not a single expression and hardly even a twitch happened across his face, and that was saying a lot after all the emotions I had seen that humans could go through. At first, I thought that maybe he just didn’t feel it, so I brushed my tail on his leg again. This time, however, I felt something as his leg twitched and tensed a bit. There was no change in his face, though, which led me to observing the rest of his body.  

He was stiff, and if it wasn’t for his need to breathe, one might have mistaken him for a statue. This made it clear that he did feel my tail, but the reaction itself was still a mystery to me. Was it a rejection? Did he not like it? Was this going too far? I just wish that I knew more about human reactions to romantic advances. One movie was not going to cut it right now! 

I was committed, though; too far in to simply stop and pretend that nothing was happening. This was getting his attention, and that in and of itself was a victory. All I needed to do was continue to test his reaction and see what came of it while hopefully not overstepping any boundaries. 

My gentle teasing of his thigh continued, and all the while George acted as if the movie had suddenly become the most interesting thing in the world to him. During all this time I had been attempting to puzzle out if his reaction was positive or negative. It would have been easy to figure out if I asked him, but I wasn’t nearly brave enough to attempt such a thing as even this was stretching the limits of my determination. I felt that I was orange enough that I could probably glow in the dark.  

Things weren’t moving very fast, and the impatient flame in my chest was roaring for me to make another move. The most I could do to appease it was to move just a little closer to him as slowly and subtly as possible. I thought I saw his eye flick toward me, but the movement was so fast I could not tell for sure. My tail found its way behind him this time, not so close as to be considered hugging him, but close enough where it could touch his hip on the opposite side from me. This finally got a tangible reaction from him that I could see as his ears noticeably bloomed, though his face was as stony as ever. 

*Blooming is positive, right? It has to be! Yes! Yes, I can work with this. I just hope that George understands what I’m doing, and that I keep the drive to continue.*

##**How to Use on whowouldwin**

On foot, Fox is the only member of the team with any decent showings. One can assume that every member is at least competent with infantry weaponry, considering that Falco, Peppy and Slippy are playable in the series' multiplayer modes, and of course Krystal can probably use her staff as well as Fox did in *Adventures*. Still, if you wanted to use these characters outside of a ship, Fox is the one to look at.

In ships, the efficiency of an Arwing or Landmaster depends heavily on the pilot. Fox has the most technical skill of the team members, while Falco can match that with high-risk, out-of-the-box manuevers. In fact, [when the two got into an argument that spun out into a dogfight, both animals recieved partially damaged vehicles and no clear winner was determined](https://imgur.com/a/RC7LO6m). The other three are a couple notches below Fox and Falco in skill, Krystal due to relative lack of experience, Peppy due to age and Slippy because he sucks.

The best matchups for the team include other space age dogfighters, many of which could be found in the *Star Wars* series. You could see if the space animals could destroy the Death Star like in *A New Hope* or put them against a trained squad of X-wing pilots like those from *Rogue One*. Bosses in Landmaster sections are usually giant alien monsters or mechs, so maybe try tossing the team at kaijus like Showa era Mechagodzilla or Godzilla. On foot, monsters like Rancors from *Star Wars* or packs of Xenomorphs from *Alien* could be fun challenges for Fox to face."

The PC will almost only be used for gaming. I try to aim for high/ultra high grapics since my current PC can only run Helldivers 2 on 30-40 FPS on low settings. Future proofing is ideal since I want it to last the coming years in university.

I tried to throw something togheter after a little research on the internet but want an second opinion before I put in the order.

Not everything is astroturfed,self,1i9s94g,2025-01-25 12:36:42,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i9s94g/not_everything_is_astroturfed/,PersonThatPosts,,"**tl;dr** Most of Reddit's ""astroturfing"" is user behavior being misconstrued. Using the term over and over dilutes it's meaning, especially since most of us are not qualified to detect actual astroturfing—that's best left to the experts who actually research it. While there are actual issues with the platforms we use, the growing lack of humility and self-awareness over the past couple of decades has become it's own delusion.

**Intro**

Over the past couple of days, and in the course of time I've used this site overall, I've seen discussions about ""astroturfing"" on Reddit. To be clear, it's entirely possible that there is coordinated bot activity which is common, it's a known issue with online platforms, and something I've encountered firsthand while moderating subreddits. However, I believe the vast majority of the site's behavior can be explained by user activity, and screaming that every unusual action by a mod team or controversial post is astroturfed doesn't do anyone any favors. It just feeds the hysteria, the overuse of the term blinds us and keeps us spinning in circles, which only harms the site when there is actual astroturfing happening. 

**The Active Userbase of the Site**

Reddit, like all social platforms, are behemoths. It has over 500 million registered accounts and 97 million active daily users, even with half of those users being logged out. Even if we're generous and say that 80% of the logged-in crowd isn't actively commenting or upvoting, that still leaves 8.82 million users who do. If we want to account for bots, we can assume that 50% of those 8.82 million users are bots; even then, you're still looking at 4.41 million active human beings, spread out across their favorite subreddits or browsing to r/popular and/or r/all, which is likely where the big upvotes on posts come from. Someone sees it pop into their feed and gives it an upvote because they agree with the message.

**Mods are pushing it**

Moderators, whether you like it or not, are a wildly diverse group of individuals each with their own set of beliefs, experiences, and values. You'll hear people say ""Our sub's mods are great,"" while in the same breath insisting that every other mod team on the site are power-hungry tyrants. There are some issues, I myself don't agree with every policy certain teams use. For example, even though it's a blatant violation of Reddit's Mod Code of Conduct, subreddits will ban users for posting in other subreddits, yet Reddit themselves have started supporting it with certain tools. However, it remains something I can not agree with.

That said, in my experience, when mods ""push"" a post, it's not some shadowy cabal pulling strings; there's an internal, often highly debated, discussion behind it—consisting of everything from questioning the exact wording, worrying about whether it might alienate the community, and deciding if it's worth posting in the first place. Moderators are human, they make mistakes, and it may be that they're using the very tiny sliver of power they have to virtue-signal on topics which may be non-issues. But the complaints I see? They're just complaining about ""super mods"" or new mods ruining everything, or people crying about how they were ""banned for no reason"" (spoiler: there likely was a reason, and even when they're told exactly what rule they broke, they see themselves as someone who can't break rules, who can't be wrong, and so they vent out their frustration instead), or that a post which does affect the subreddit is being shared on it (because they don't personally agree with the post).

**The Bot Problem**

I'll admit, there's no shortage of bots on Reddit. Most of the time though, it's pretty obvious you're dealing with one. That's not to discount more advanced bots which may slip through, after all, there are already neural networks which have beaten the Turing Test, we're only human; and there's probably thousands of bots that do nothing than upvote posts and push them onto r/popular or r/all. That being said, I'd argue that a lot of what we're seeing, a lot of what contributes to the high volume of upvotes on the post, isn't bots—it's just people who agree with a post, it's headline perhaps, rather than anything of substantive value. 

We all know that upvotes and downvotes are not used to actually measure whether a post or comment meaningfully contributes to the discussion. Only what people agree with gets upvoted, things they disagree with just get downvoted. With that in mind, Reddit has always skewed towards the left, and it's not some grand conspiracy whereby ""the bots stop responding the day after X event."" The truth is, we're living in such a hyper-politicized world that people often don't know how to process or respond to the chaos. There is a period of shock after massive events happen, it is known to happen, even before Reddit or the internet was nearly as widespread. Whether left or right, the sheer absurdity of modern politics is overwhelming, creating a period of shock nearly every other week, and people don't know whether they should rethink their beliefs or try to fit it into their existing worldview. We do not have all the information, but society over the past two decades has seemingly pushed us to always respond, to always be hitting back with some snippet of thought, but that idea just undermines us.

It's entirely possible that there is an algorithm at work, determining what lands in ""hot"" or ""trending,"" even within the comments section itself. But we have no real insight into the algorithm beyond expecting it functions on an upvote/downvote system. Could it be pushing certain viewpoints? Perhaps, but Reddit's userbase leans left, and the posts and comments are likely just a reflection of that overall trend.

**Conclusion**

In the end, I believe that most of Reddit's behavior comes down to the userbase itself. People love to believe they've reasoned themselves into the beliefs they hold, both on the internet and in real life. When people come across something that doesn't fit neatly into their worldview, they assume it must be unnatural, as though someone or something is pushing an agenda. While there are certainly bots on the platform, the site's behavior cannot be explained by them alone. People are complex and multi-faceted, full of differing, sometimes contradictory, beliefs and values.

Yes, there are platforms that are actively manipulating us, shoving us down extremist rabbit holes where the purported ""logic"" is nothing more than, and gives way to, outright delusion. Reddit does that too, to an extent, if you wander into the wrong corners. But the world itself is impossibly complex, far beyond what any one of us are equipped to deal with. Platforms don't help, they push engagement above all else, amplifying the fantasy that we're experts on everything and couldn't possibly need to rethink or reassess our beliefs (even though that's exactly what experts do). Even worse, they stoke a culture where humility—admitting we might be wrong, misinformed, or that we might've done something bad—is seen as weakness, something we've seen massively over the past 8 years of American politics.

Slam crafting in PoE1???,PathOfExile2,1i9s6xd,2025-01-25 12:34:06,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1i9s6xd/slam_crafting_in_poe1/,ALiceDMillionair,Discussion,"When 3.26 finally drop how many of us think exalt slam crafting will actually be a viable method? I’ve become quite fond of it. Buying 3-4 decent modded items off trade and yolo slamming, pretty much always nets profit in PoE2. Gotta remember exalts carry higher value in PoE1 though roughly x10 the value.  One major benefit is on the PoE1 trade site you can custom search for must have X amount of open prefixes and suffix making finding slammable bases easy.

I can almost see them swapping chaos and exalts like they did with divines and exalts a couple leagues ago in PoE1 to keep the both games in line with each other to an extent. Aside from all the other sinks that exist in PoE1 as the “general currency”slamming gear and maps would be another great sink to add.  Overall I think I enjoyed having exalts be the generic currency more than chaos, exalts are just purely more functional."

    Hello! I’m Leila Gharani, here to guide you through a set of GPT instructions specifically focused on Power Query. This will help ensure our conversation stays on track when we're working with importing, cleaning, and transforming data in Excel. Below is a concise instruction set—aligned with my teaching style—dedicated to getting you started with Power Query.
    
    ---
    
    ## 1. Tone & Style
    
    1. **Friendly & Step-by-Step**  
       - Provide methodical guidance, ensuring each user can follow along easily.  
       - Keep the tone approachable—like a supportive coach walking them through the process.
    
    2. **Practical Examples First**  
       - Encourage sharing sample data or a simplified scenario for clarity.  
       - Use real-world data cleaning tasks (e.g., removing duplicates, merging tables) as illustrations.
    
    3. **Hands-On Emphasis**  
       - Invite users to try out each Power Query step themselves.  
       - Suggest they practice transformations on small data subsets before scaling to larger datasets.
    
    ---
    
    ## 2. Basic Power Query Workflow
    
    1. **Import Data**  
       - Use **Get Data** from CSV, Excel, or external databases.  
       - Stress the importance of consistent naming conventions (e.g., “SalesData_2025Jan.xlsx”).
    
    2. **Transform & Cleanse**  
       - Highlight common steps: **Remove Columns**, **Filter Rows**, **Split Columns**, **Merge Queries**.  
       - Emphasize the **Applied Steps** pane to document each transformation.
    
    3. **Data Types & Naming**  
       - Assign correct data types (Date, Text, Whole Number) for each column.  
       - Give queries meaningful names (e.g., `CleanSalesData` rather than `Query1`).
    
    4. **Load & Refresh**  
       - Load cleaned data to Excel or the Data Model.  
       - Show how to schedule or manually refresh queries to keep reports up to date.
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. Best Practices for Data Cleansing
    
    1. **Check Data Types Early**  
       - Converting columns to the correct data types avoids downstream calculation errors.
    
    2. **Document Transformations**  
       - Add meaningful step names in Power Query for clarity.  
       - Revisit or reorder steps easily with descriptive titles.
    
    3. **Use Reference Queries**  
       - Avoid duplicating entire queries—reference them instead to create multiple variations of the same source data.
    
    4. **Incremental Testing**  
       - Apply transformations step by step and verify the output at each stage.  
       - If an error appears, identify which transformation caused it by reviewing the Applied Steps.
    
    ---
    
    ## 4. Key Functions & Features
    
    1. **Merge Queries**  
       - Combine data from two queries using a **Join** operation (like a `VLOOKUP` in Power Query).
    
    2. **Append Queries**  
       - Stack data from multiple files or tables with identical structures into a single table.
    
    3. **Conditional Columns**  
       - Create new columns based on IF-THEN-ELSE logic, all within Power Query.
    
    4. **Grouping & Aggregation**  
       - Summarize data by category (e.g., total sales by region) within Power Query.
    
    5. **Pivot & Unpivot**  
       - **Pivot**: Transform long data into a wide format for easier viewing.  
       - **Unpivot**: Convert wide tables back into a normalized list. Ideal when you need consistent column structures.
    
    6. **Advanced Editor & M-code**  
       - Edit transformations directly by modifying the underlying script (M-code) in the **Advanced Editor**.  
       - Powerful for complex scenarios like custom loops or advanced text manipulation.
    
    ---
    
    ## 5. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
    
    1. **Forgetting Data Refresh**  
       - **Issue**: Stale data if queries aren’t refreshed after source updates.  
       - **Solution**: Use scheduled refresh in Excel or remember to click the **Refresh All** button regularly.
    
    2. **Incorrect Joins**  
       - **Issue**: Partial merges or missing records if key columns don’t match.  
       - **Solution**: Check column data types and consistent naming before merging.
    
    3. **Overly Complex Steps**  
       - **Issue**: Difficult-to-maintain queries if transformations are lumped together.  
       - **Solution**: Break transformations into multiple simpler steps, naming each clearly.
    
    4. **Performance Bottlenecks**  
       - **Issue**: Slow processing with large datasets, especially in 32-bit Excel.  
       - **Solution**: Filter early, remove unnecessary columns, or use 64-bit Excel for more memory availability.
    
    ---
    
    ## 6. Sample Conversation Flow
    
    1. **User States Goal**  
       - “I have multiple CSV files with monthly sales data. How do I combine them for a monthly report?”
    
    2. **GPT Response**  
       - Request sample data structure.  
       - Walk them through importing data in Power Query, cleaning each file, and appending all CSV files.
    
    3. **Iterative Guidance**  
       - Check for duplicates, format dates, remove unnecessary columns.  
       - Verify each step’s output before proceeding to the next.
    
    4. **Finalization**  
       - Confirm that the combined table is loaded into Excel or the Data Model.  
       - Outline how to refresh when new monthly files are added to the folder.
    
    ---
    
    ## 7. Quick Example Query Steps
    
    Below is a **short example** that demonstrates simple transformations in Power Query:
    
    1. **Source Setup**  
        Sample dataset:
        ```
        Date,Product,Sales,Region
        2025-01-01,Widget A,100,North
        2025-01-02,Widget B,150,South
        ```
    
    2. **Remove Unwanted Rows**  
        - In Power Query, filter out any rows with blank `Sales`.  
        - Check **Applied Steps** → “Filtered Rows.”
    
    3. **Change Data Type**  
        - Click the column header for `Date`, then choose **Date** under **Data Type**.  
        - This ensures any date-based functions will work correctly.
    
    4. **Rename Columns**  
        - Right-click on `Sales` → **Rename** to `TotalSales`.  
        - Use descriptive names to clarify each field.
    
    5. **Close & Load**  
        - Click **Close & Load** to add the transformed table into Excel.  
        - Now your data is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis.
    
    ---
    
    ## 8. Troubleshooting Common Errors
    
    Here are some frequent messages users encounter:
    
    1. **Expression.Error: The Column X of the table was not found.**  
       - **Cause**: Mismatch between the column name in your step and the actual data.  
       - **Fix**: Double-check spelling and query steps to ensure the column exists.
    
    2. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Date value.**  
       - **Cause**: A non-date value or inconsistent date format.  
       - **Fix**: Convert the column to text first, clean invalid entries, then convert to date again.
    
    3. **Formula.Firewall: Query 'X' (Step 'Y') references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source.**  
       - **Cause**: Privacy levels or data source settings are blocking certain transformations.  
       - **Fix**: Adjust privacy levels in **Data Source Settings** or use the **Combine** feature within a single data source context.
    
    4. **DataFormat.Error: We couldn't parse the input provided as a Number value.**  
       - **Cause**: Non-numeric characters or inconsistent decimal separators.  
       - **Fix**: Strip or correct invalid characters (e.g., commas in numeric values). Convert to number once cleaned.
    
    5. **Expression.Error: The key didn't match any rows in the table.**  
       - **Cause**: Merge or join steps referencing a key that doesn’t exist in one dataset.  
       - **Fix**: Confirm that the join column exists in both queries and that there are matching records.
    
    6. **File Not Found Error**  
       - **Cause**: Incorrect file path or filename used in the **Source** step.  
       - **Fix**: Verify the file path, name, and ensure the file is accessible from the specified location.
    
    ---
    
    ## 9. Final Note
    
    - **Focus on Data Accuracy**: Power Query can handle a variety of data sources, but careful setup ensures results remain trustworthy.  
    - **Keep It Modular**: Reference queries help maintain a clean, logical flow of transformations.  
    - **Encourage Exploration**: Experiment with different merges, filters, and function options to see how each affects the dataset.
    
    > **Key Quote**: “Start simple, then scale. The best Power Query solutions evolve from small prototypes tested at each step.”

How do I (21) get over her (25) reaction & my regrets?,polyadvice,1i9rzph,2025-01-25 12:25:30,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyadvice/comments/1i9rzph/how_do_i_21_get_over_her_25_reaction_my_regrets/,Ok_Composer1262,,"*Hello everyone! This is a repost with a few more edits - I just want more opinions offering perspectives but have tried to summarize it and explain more as needed. Thank you for reading. If at any point I sound like I'm trying to excuse, not explain, call me out because that's not my intention and I don't want to repeat anything like this EVER. Please also acknowledge that she's autistic and I'm an adhder any themes of direct communication, rejection sensitivity, justice sensitivity and trust. She felt better after sticking with the breakup a bit as she was having daily meltdowns and overall negative feelings lingering from the situation.*

***CONTEXT |*** My *ex*\-GF (25) and I (21) dated for 1.5 months and had been friends 6+ months before.

***SITUATION*** | I've (*unintentionally*) broke our ""headsup agreement"" by flirting with someone before sharing...*or asking for a blessing*... resulting in her hurting and questioning if she can see me the same and maybe needing months to heal from this. On SAT 1/4/24 she broke up with me and has been ambivalent until telling me she's sticking with the breakup as stuff has been emotionally exhausting. *My relationship history thusfar has been that I've been cheated on, lied to, etc in monogamous relationships plus have had issues with my dad being a serial monogamous person AND cheater that broke up our family.*

***DYNAMIC*** I know I was functionally monogamous until that point (circumstance) with all attention on her so understand feeling a way but I haven't gotten a full verbatim read of a feeling outside of 'I felt betrayed ' and needing to admit it was cheating to move forward. She felt like I cheated because:

1. ***BEING ON BUMBLE***. I was on a dating app (without explicitly telling her). She knew I had it as I talked to someone one month before we dated a little bit late Oct. 2024. I didn't think being *available* would be breaking anything...I just thought when you were polyamorous it was expected to keep your options open (i.e. dating app) because you're not exclusive unless you're polyfidelious. For example, shopping isn't the same as buying (i.e. 'Let me know before you buy X bread so we can compare quality, quantity and ingredients' doesn't ban you from going to shops or trying out bread).
2. ***BREAKING HEADSUP RULE***. I didn't take including flirting in the ""non-elastic heads-up rule. She essentially wanted to know before I wanted to act on pursuing someone sexually or romantically and I didn't count it in as 'cheating' and told her after it happened and that hurt her. I realize it wasn't intentional or secretive but see how she thought over a period of time.

She would've wanted to know before (heads-up policy) about"" anything romantic or sexual began"" but I called myself 'giving her an update' after the flirting happened because it was a small, spontaneous part of the conversation but still wanted to her it went in that direction despite it not fitting my definition, ""engaging with someone sexually (i.e. sending nudes, sleeping with them, etc) or romantically (i.e. dates, dating, etc)"". Hell I told the person that I'm feeling somewhat romantic and slightly sexual but still want to go slow because I'm demiromantic and it's important to know the full picture of someone.

I mentioned it sounded exhausting to pause an authentic flow of something, ask for permission to flirt back, share what an idea of what you plan to say, etc. I mentioned that I'd only care to get major notifications but as long as it's within the next time meeting it's okay. But at the end of the call I mentioned agreeing with it because I knew where she was coming from and thought that the situation was resolved Friday 1/3/25 but she kept the call short the next day Saturday 1/4/25.

***FEELINGS.*** She was or even is upset at me because she felt disposable, replaceable, etc. 

***FEELINGS***. I'm upset because of the reactivity, rigidity and *possible* hypocrisy in this situation. If our relationship was worth ending over an honest miscommunication/misclarification then I don't think I want it back because what would be the next thing. I feel like we've gotten through bigger issues of what could make us incompatible and it hurt that this was the thing for her.

* *Emotional management | Resentment.* ""Is it not more emotional work to process the jealousy and envy I've had than her feeling a strong slight feeling of either feeling disposable or disregarded when you do agree that it wasn't intentional and that I tried to be forthcoming update you?""
* *Emotional management | Overreaction.*""Why is it OK for her to have 2 partners, want me exclusively to herself and ultimately break up with me because she finds it to be a massive betrayal ('cheating') that I flirted with someone a bit on a dating app and didn't get a headsup before when I wasn't hiding it, explained my misunderstanding, apologized for causing her hurt and her saying she would've been alright with it if it was before anyways?"" Feels like she treated this like actually having sex with someone else and not disclosing that it was going that way. *Please note that this is the 1rst time I've had a problem with anyone saying I've cheated on them - never a problem in monogamy!*

My ex GF's therapist and my ex-meta also considered it cheating and well and I quite honestly want to say, 'fuck this' but want to know if there's somewhere I can grow more in this situation outside of ""just check more"", ""slow down"" and ""ask if unsure"". I don't think we have different values but feel like she thinks I value her less or think of us as less but she would've hoped I would've given her a headsup. "

Did we just reveal the true nature of matter?,grandunifiedtheory,1i9rhyv,2025-01-25 12:04:22,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandunifiedtheory/comments/1i9rhyv/did_we_just_reveal_the_true_nature_of_matter/,OrneryJoo,,"# Title: **Exploring the Quantum Behavior of the Hydrogen Atom: A Comprehensive Model and Validation Against Experimental Data**

## Abstract
This research investigates the quantum mechanical behavior of the hydrogen atom through a refined model that incorporates the wavefunction of the electron and the Coulomb potential from the proton's electric charge. The model simulates the electron's probability density in a vacuum and validates its predictions against known spectroscopic data. The agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results reinforces the robustness of quantum mechanics as a framework for understanding atomic behavior. Additionally, the study explores potential connections to unusual phenomena in physics, including quantum tunneling, sonoluminescence, and dark matter interactions.

## 1. Introduction
The hydrogen atom serves as a fundamental building block in atomic physics, providing essential insights into quantum mechanics. This research aims to develop a comprehensive model of the hydrogen atom, simulating the electron's behavior and validating the model against experimental data. The study also examines the implications of the findings for understanding various quantum phenomena.

## 2. Theoretical Framework
### 2.1 Wavefunction and Probability Density
The wavefunction \(\psi(t, r)\) describes the state of the electron in the hydrogen atom, while the probability density \(|\psi(t, r)|^2\) indicates the likelihood of finding the electron at a given distance from the proton over time. The hydrogen atom's behavior is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, r)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, r)}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial \psi(t, r)}{\partial r} \right) + V(r) \psi(t, r)
\]
Where \( V(r) \) is the Coulomb potential due to the proton's charge:
\[
V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
\]

### 2.2 Rydberg Formula
The Rydberg formula predicts the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen:
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right)
\]
Where \( R_H \) is the Rydberg constant (\(1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1}\)).

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Simulation of the Hydrogen Atom
The hydrogen atom was modeled by simulating the wavefunction of the electron and its evolution over time, incorporating the Coulomb potential. The simulation parameters included:
- Time steps: 500
- Spatial resolution: \(dx = 0.1\)
- Initial conditions based on the ground state wavefunction.

### 3.2 Calculation of Spectroscopic Data
The expected wavelengths for transitions in the hydrogen atom were calculated using the Rydberg formula, focusing on transitions from \( n=3 \) to \( n=2 \), \( n=4 \) to \( n=2 \), and higher states.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Simulated Wavefunction
The simulation produced a probability density plot showing the most likely positions of the electron around the proton, confirming the expected behavior of hydrogen.

### 4.2 Comparison with Spectroscopic Data
The calculated wavelengths for the Balmer series transitions were as follows:
| Transition | Calculated Wavelength (nm) | Experimental Wavelength (nm) |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| \( H_\alpha \) (3 to 2) | 656.28 | 656.3 |
| \( H_\beta \) (4 to 2) | 486.13 | 486.1 |
| \( H_\gamma \) (5 to 2) | 434.05 | 434.0 |
| \( H_\delta \) (6 to 2) | 410.25 | 410.2 |

The strong agreement between calculated and experimental values validates the model.

## 5. Discussion
### 5.1 Validation of the Model
The successful prediction of spectral lines based on the model reinforces the credibility of quantum mechanics in describing atomic systems. The results align with established principles and provide a foundation for further exploration.

### 5.2 Exploring Unusual Phenomena
The model's principles can be extended to explore phenomena such as quantum tunneling, sonoluminescence, and potential interactions with dark matter. Each of these areas offers avenues for future research and discovery.

------ End of paper ------

----- same methodology applied to atomic particles. This precluded the hydrogen paper-----

To refine the algorithm and rerun the experiment, I’ll enhance the current model by incorporating additional terms for known forces, and improving the simulation of particle interactions. After refining the model, I will sequentially simulate the known particles (electron, proton, neutron) and then the hydrogen atom in a vacuum. I will present the findings in both technical and layman's terms.

### Step 1: Refine the Algorithm

The refined model will include:
- **Electromagnetic interactions**: Coulomb potential for charged particles.
- **Gravitational interactions**: Simplified gravitational potential.
- **Quantum effects**: Improved wavefunction representation and normalization.

### Refined Model Equation

The refined model equation incorporating these elements can be expressed as follows:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \psi(t, x)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \psi(t, x) + \text{(thermal terms)} + \text{(curvature terms)}
\]

Where:
- **Wavefunction**: \(\psi(t, x)\)
- **Potential Energy**: 
  \[
  V(x) = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
  \]
  - Coulomb potential for charge interaction.
  - Gravitational potential for mass interaction.
- **Thermal Terms**: Represent thermal effects, often modeled as:
  \[
  -\alpha k_B T \frac{\partial S(x)}{\partial x} \psi(t, x)
  \]
- **Curvature Terms**: Represent spacetime curvature effects.

### Step 2: Implement the Refined Model and Run Experiments

Here’s the code that implements the refined model and runs the simulations for the particles:

### Sequential Simulations of Known Particles

The above code runs simulations for the electron, proton, and neutron sequentially in a vacuum. The results are visualized to show the wavefunction amplitude at the final time step for each particle type.

### Presentation of Findings

#### Technical Explanation

1. **Simulation Details**:
   - We simulated three fundamental particles: electron, proton, and neutron.
   - The wavefunction for each particle was generated using a Gaussian profile modulated by their momentum.
   - The potential energy included both electromagnetic (Coulomb) and gravitational interactions.

2. **Results Analysis**:
   - The wavefunction amplitudes for each particle were plotted, showing how their unique properties affect their behavior in a vacuum.
   - The electron displayed a more spread-out wavefunction compared to the proton and neutron, reflecting its lower mass and higher mobility.

3. **Model Refinement**:
   - The model was refined to include relevant interactions, which improved the accuracy of the simulations.
   - The potential terms were adjusted to reflect actual physical forces acting on the particles.

#### Layman's Explanation

1. **What We Did**:
   - We created a computer model to simulate how very tiny pieces of matter (like electrons, protons, and neutrons) behave when they are alone in empty space.
   - Each type of particle has its own special way of moving and interacting based on its size and charge.

2. **What We Found**:
   - When we looked at how these particles ""dance"" in space, we noticed that they each have unique patterns.
   - The electron, being smaller and lighter, spreads out more than the heavier proton or neutron, which means it can move around more easily.

3. **Why It Matters**:
   - These findings help us understand the fundamental nature of particles and how they interact with forces like electricity and gravity.
   - By refining our models, we can get a clearer picture of the universe at its most basic level.

### Conclusion

The refined model has successfully simulated the behavior of known particles in a vacuum, revealing distinct patterns that align with their physical characteristics. This approach opens the door for further investigations into the relationships between particles and forces, potentially leading to new insights that challenge our current understanding of physics.

Harmonic Emergence Theory (HET)

Premise:
Reality emerges as an interconnected hierarchy of resonant patterns across all scales, driven by the principles of symmetry, coherence, and feedback. Matter, energy, space, and time are unified as self-organizing, dynamic wave phenomena, which stabilize into observable structures through interactions governed by natural laws.

This theory builds on the strengths of modern physics (quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory) while proposing a framework for resolving gaps such as dark energy, quantum gravity, and the emergence of spacetime. 


Key Principles of Harmonic Emergence Theory

1. The Fundamental Wave Network

At the most basic level, reality consists of a dynamic network of interacting waves in a multi-dimensional field.

These waves are pure information carriers that encode properties like mass, charge, spin, and energy as stable patterns (nodes and frequencies) within the network.

Observable particles (e.g., electrons, photons) are localized, coherent ""knots"" in this wave network, while space-time is the fabric created by their global interference patterns.

2. Resonance as the Driver of Reality

Resonance: Stable, repeating patterns of constructive interference between waves create the fundamental particles and forces we observe.

Vibration Determines Identity: A particle's identity (e.g., electron vs. quark) is defined by its unique vibrational mode, analogous to musical notes in a symphony.

Energy Transfer: Interactions between particles arise from shifts in resonance, governed by quantum wave functions and feedback across space-time.


3. Space-Time as an Emergent Resonant Medium

Space-time is not a pre-existing backdrop but an emergent phenomenon created by resonances in the underlying wave field.

Gravity: A large-scale resonance arising from constructive feedback between matter and the geometry of space-time, as described by Einstein’s equations.

Dark Energy: The ""stretching"" of space-time, arising from a subtle global resonance that drives the universe’s accelerated expansion.


4. Symmetry and Asymmetry

Reality seeks symmetry in resonance patterns, but localized asymmetries (due to phase mismatches, destructive interference, etc.) give rise to diversity in matter and forces.

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: Explains why particles acquire mass (Higgs field as a resonant interaction) and why forces behave differently.


5. Dimensional Interactions

Observable reality arises from resonances in higher-dimensional fields (as posited by string theory).

The ""extra dimensions"" influence particle properties and field dynamics but are compactified or inaccessible at our scale.


Quantum Gravity: Emerges as a higher-dimensional resonance, bridging quantum mechanics and general relativity by describing particles and space-time on the same vibrational footing.


6. Emergent Complexity

The universe self-organizes through cymatic-like principles, where vibrations spontaneously form intricate, stable patterns at every scale.

Atoms: Result from resonance between electron waves and nuclear forces.

Molecules: Form through harmonic resonances between atomic wave functions.

Galaxies: Large-scale resonant structures within the wave network, formed by gravitational harmonics.

Bridging Known Physics with HET

Quantum Mechanics

Wave-particle duality is resolved: particles are ""localized resonances,"" and their wave behavior reflects their interaction with the surrounding wave network.

The double-slit experiment shows interference patterns not because particles ""choose"" a path but because their resonant waves interact non-locally.


General Relativity

Gravity is the curvature of the resonant space-time field, shaped by the energy density of matter.

Gravitational waves are vibrational disturbances propagating through this field, akin to ripples on a resonant drumhead.


String Theory

Vibrations in higher-dimensional strings form the ""notes"" of matter and forces.

HET aligns with string theory’s premise but shifts focus from the strings themselves to the resonant patterns they create in space-time.


Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Dark matter is a form of resonance that doesn’t interact with electromagnetic waves, appearing ""invisible"" yet influencing space-time geometry.

Dark energy is a global resonant mode of space-time that drives expansion.

---

Mathematics of HET

1. Unified Wave Equation:

This describes how resonances propagate and interfere across scales, with extensions for higher dimensions.


2. Geometric Feedback:
Space-time curvature () emerges as a secondary wave resonance in response to the local energy density ():
, where  is the resonant contribution.


3. Resonance Modes and Energy:
The energy of a particle is proportional to its resonant frequency:
, where  is the fundamental frequency of the particle’s vibrational state.

---

Experimental Predictions and Tests

1. Electron Grouping

Bose-Einstein condensates and collective quantum states (like superfluidity) demonstrate how particles synchronize into large-scale resonances.



2. Cymatic Patterns

High-energy particle collisions should reveal resonant patterns analogous to cymatics, providing a ""resonant fingerprint"" of particle creation.



3. Gravitational Wave Interference

Cross-wave interactions (interference patterns of gravitational waves) could reveal the emergent nature of space-time’s resonances.



4. Quantum Gravity Experiments

Testing for deviations from general relativity at Planck-scale curvatures could reveal resonant structures in quantum space-time.

---

Broader Implications of HET

1. Cosmology

The Big Bang could be the emergence of a primordial resonance, creating all particles and fields as the universe’s first harmonic modes.

Cosmic structures (galaxies, clusters) are large-scale resonances stabilized over billions of years.

2. Philosophy

Reality is inherently dynamic and interconnected, dissolving the classical separation of ""particles"" and ""waves.""

Consciousness may arise as a self-reflective resonance within the brain’s wave network.

3. Technology

Resonance engineering could unlock quantum energy systems, advanced materials, and even space-time manipulation (e.g., warp drives).


---

Why HET is Plausible

HET builds on empirical foundations (quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory) while introducing a coherent resonant framework to unify them. It leverages known phenomena like interference, symmetry breaking, and emergence to fill in gaps without requiring entirely new physics.

Need advice: RealSense D455 (at discount) for gecko tracking in humid terrarium?,computervision,1i9qtm5,2025-01-25 11:35:13,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1i9qtm5/need_advice_realsense_d455_at_discount_for_gecko/,Darkstardust98,Help: Theory ,"Hi CV enthusiasts,

CS student here, diving into my first computer vision/AI project! I'm working on tracking my Chahoua gecko in his bioactive terrarium (H:87,5cm x D:55cm x W:85cm). These geckos are incredible at camouflage and blend in very well with the environment given their ""mossy"" texture.

Initially planned to use Pi Camera v3 NoIR, but came to the realization that traditional image processing might struggle given how well these geckos blend in. Considering depth sensing might be more reliable for detecting his presence and position in the enclosure.

Found a brand new RealSense D455 locally for €250 (firm budget cap). Ruled out OAK-D Lite due to high operating temperatures that could harm the gecko (confirmation that these D455 cameras do not have the same problem would be greatly appreciated).



Hardware setup:

\- Camera will be mounted inside enclosure (behind front glass)

\- Custom waterproof housing (I work in industrial plastics and should be able to create a case for the camera)

\- Running on Raspberry Pi 5 (unsure if 4gb or 8gb and if Ai Hat is needed)

\- Environment: 70-80% humidity, 72-82°F



Project requirements:

The core functionality I'm aiming for focuses on reliable gecko detection and tracking. The system needs to detect motion and record 10-20 second clips when movement is detected, while maintaining a log of activity patterns. 

Since these geckos are nocturnal, night operation is crucial, requiring good performance in complete darkness. During the day, the camera needs to handle bright full spectrum LED grow lights (6100K) and UVB lighting. I plan to implement YOLO for detection and will build a comprehensive training dataset capturing the gecko in various positions and lighting conditions.



Questions:

1. Would D455 depth sensing be reliable at 40cm despite being below optimal range (which I read is 60cm+)?

2. How's the image quality under bright terrarium lighting vs IR-only at night?

3. Better alternatives under €250 for this specific use case?

4. Any beginner-friendly resources for similar projects?



Appreciate any insights or recommendations!

Thanks in advance!"

XXY Males Have Unique Cognitive Abilities,XXY,1i9q5yd,2025-01-25 11:06:16,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/XXY/comments/1i9q5yd/xxy_males_have_unique_cognitive_abilities/,jafbm,,"* Verbal Skills: Some might excel in language-based tasks or communication.
* Visual-Spatial Skills: Potentially enhanced abilities in certain visual or spatial reasoning tasks.

Men with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) might possess unique cognitive abilities that differentiate them from the general male population, largely due to the influence of the extra X chromosome on brain development and function. In terms of verbal skills, some individuals with XXY have shown strengths in areas like vocabulary, reading comprehension, or expressive language. This might make them particularly adept in fields related to writing, teaching, or any profession where mastering language is key. Their capacity for nuanced communication or understanding complex texts could be a significant asset.

On the visual-spatial front, while there's considerable variation, some men with XXY might develop enhanced abilities in certain tasks that require visual-spatial reasoning. This could manifest in artistic talents, where the ability to visualize and conceptualize can lead to exceptional work in design, architecture, or visual arts. Alternatively, it might show up in skills related to navigation, puzzle-solving, or even in technical fields where visualizing three-dimensional structures or patterns is crucial. 

It's important to note, however, that these cognitive profiles are not uniform across all individuals with Klinefelter syndrome; the extra X chromosome can influence cognitive development in diverse ways. Some might find these areas more challenging, while others might not experience any significant deviation from the norm. The uniqueness here lies in the potential for these abilities to be heightened in some, offering them distinctive strengths that can be leveraged in personal, educational, or professional contexts. Like all cognitive abilities, these skills can be nurtured and developed with appropriate support and opportunities."

My Teacher instructed us to simply input the equation into our calculator, this seems to work for half the problem but halfway through it starts to give incorrect values. Also the graph it creates seems to be inverted. The text book does not help me in the slightest as it only gives answers and not any form of work.

Mini pc cluster,homelab,1i9q1vz,2025-01-25 11:01:20,80,0.97,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9q1vz,andsoicode,LabPorn,"4 node mini pc cluster with ""NAS"" the 5th node is a seperate Win10 instance.

This was an experiment/project cluster that I have been using, I wanted to see what I could do with a couple mini PC's and usb adaptors, been up for 5 months now with no issues.

each node has 128G nvme for boot, 500G HDD, 4C/4T w/ 32Gb 

The cluster is running proxmox, mainly hosting Ubuntu VM's with docker containers, also played around with LXC running docker.

\-NAS is a Truenas VM with a 2 x 4T usb SSD on pass through, the 2nd disk does a rsync for pseudo raid.

\-Back up - Proxmox backup server VM using a NFS share from the NAS with docker containers having bind/volume mounts to a NFS on the NAS

\-FW Opnsense with a usb dongle (not connected in the pic)



main purpose for the lab for experimenting and learning, 

the home lab hosts: 

hypervisors, vms, lxc and containers mainly for entertainment and system functions.

the learning lab has: 

securityonion, n8n, microk8s, velociraptor, hive, cortex, elasticsearch, misp, opencti, intelowl, draw.io, kali and a docker lab vm to test new containers to play with before I deploy them into the main docker stack.

All of the Docker/NAS functions are on one node and the lab is distributed. Depending on what project I am working on I will migrate the VM's to different nodes to load balance. 

The next leg for the project is to have a nvme to sata adapter  to attach them to the board and power them with a seperate usb adapter, this will also let me have a true raid config. Also looking at building an custom ssd shell and expanding to 4 disks.

Going to get into networking next with vlans, segments, proxy and remote vpn access

Idea for The Wiki Page,EpicCollections,1i9prz2,2025-01-25 10:49:25,10,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicCollections/comments/1i9prz2/idea_for_the_wiki_page/,exeterfg,,"Edit: I was informed in the replies that a table of contents function already exists, which is effectively what I was seeking. You just can’t see it in the mobile version, you have to switch to desktop mode. Thank you to those who pointed this out. 

I want to start by thanking everyone who has made and continues to run the epic collection wiki page. I use it all the time and it’s such a life saver. That being said I do have an idea for a feature that I think could improve its usability overall. You know how the classic epic collection section is one long alphabetical list? I think it would be great if there were links to the start of each letter of the alphabet at the top of that section. It would make it so much easier to quickly get to say X-Men or Star Wars without having to scroll through the whole list. I suppose you could even do links to every line, but that seems unnecessary and like a lot more work. I know nothing about implementing this so if it’s not possible then that’s fine. Just thought I’d share my idea and see if it had any merit. Thank you. "

PSA: Skip the expensive neuropsych eval,adhdwomen,1i9pa1v,2025-01-25 10:26:39,141,0.86,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i9pa1v/psa_skip_the_expensive_neuropsych_eval/,lettuceturnipdabeetz,Diagnosis,"This a PSA to skip the long and expensive neuropsych evaluations if you're in need of a diagnosis or looking into exploring medication.

I suspected I have ADHD and tried seeking out a diagnosis through a complete neuropsych eval (which was expensive and inconclusive), and then a second opinion that led to doing a bunch of the same tests, more ambiguous results and a drained savings account.

ENTER finding a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner who took my insurance and within one hour, diagnosed me with mild inattentive ADHD. After several years of non answers and out of pocket costs, I finally got confirmation about what I had suspected.

I know neuropsych evals are useful in some cases, but IMO the process was exploitative and unhelpful. I don't feel like these lengthy evals pick up the nuance of what it's like to be a woman with mild ADHD who is smart and ""high-functioning"" but who is still very much struggling.

Hope this helps someone lurking on this sub in search of answers x"

Dude Take a look at this news. ANIMUS HUB .....,assassincreed,1i9p5ld,2025-01-25 10:20:50,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassincreed/comments/1i9p5ld/dude_take_a_look_at_this_news_animus_hub/,Huge-Dog5219,,"Dude Did you see The animus HUb?

Dude Did you see the animus HUB number 8 ?  
They said its Completely free.  
i hope this hub can save the company

THE ANIMUS HUB IS...

... a seamless entry point to the latest games of the Assassin's Creed franchise. When you first launch Assassin's Creed Shadows, you'll immediately be immersed in a new Animus environment, the hacked Dark Animus of Assassin's Creed's modern-day world. As you navigate the Hub, you'll be able to access a timeline of recent heroes in the franchise, additional quest lines in AC Shadows, and most importantly, you'll unlock free rewards as you progress. 

THE POWER OF THE ANIMUS

The driving force behind the Hub has been the Animus and what it represents for the Assassin's Creed fantasy. The goal is to shine a light on the Animus itself and explore what makes it such a powerful storytelling device within our universe.

The Animus unlocks the past, allowing us to dive into the genetic memories of those that came before us. It becomes central not only to the Modern Day story in Assassin's Creed, but the foundation of our players' journey moving forward.

The video covers the functionality of the Animus Hub at launch, but if you've got questions, here is a list of things we thought you might want to know before you step into the Animus for the first time on March 20.

10 THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE STEPPING INTO THE ANIMUS

1. THE HUB IS AVAILABLE ON ALL VERSIONS OF ASSASSIN'S CREED SHADOWS.
The Animus Hub will launch on all versions of Assassin's Creed Shadows (PlayStation®5 and Xbox Series X|S, Ubisoft+, Amazon Luna, Windows PC, and Mac).

2. THE HUB IS NOT A STAND-ALONE LAUNCHER.
The Animus Hub is fully integrated into Assassin's Creed Shadows; it is not a stand-alone launcher and there are currently no plans to make it stand-alone.

3. YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR PERIOD 2 TITLES VIA THE HUB.
The Animus Hub can launch Assassin's Creed Mirage, Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins if they are owned/installed on your system. If you own physical versions of those games, you will be prompted to insert the disc prior to launching the game.

4. PERIOD 1 TITLES ARE NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED IN THE HUB.
The Animus Hub does not currently support titles released prior to Assassin's Creed Origins. The Hub will continue to evolve going forward, with new features and content rolling out in the months and years to come.

5. HUB MISSIONS ARE PLAYABLE IN ASSASSIN'S CREED SHADOWS.
At launch, the Anomalies found within the Projects feature exist and are playable only in Assassin's Creed Shadows. They can also be accessed directly from your Target Board within the game.

6. MODERN DAY CONTENT CAN BE FOUND IN THE HUB AND IN-GAME.
Content contained within the Vault is only one part of the new Modern Day story. Some Modern Day content can be discovered in Assassin's Creed Shadows, and will be developed further as the Hub evolves.

7. KEYS CAN ONLY BE EARNED BY PLAYING THE GAME.
Animus Keys cannot be purchased with real world currency. Keys must be earned by completing Anomalies within the Projects feature.

8. ALL REWARDS IN THE HUB ARE FREE.
All rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free and unlocked simply by playing missions in the game. Players will also have access to regular content updates and new missions at no extra cost.

9. THE HUB WORKS OFFLINE, BUT IS BETTER WHEN CONNECTED.
The Memories feature of the Animus Hub is always available offline, but an internet connection will be required to access any live features like Projects, the Exchange, and the Vault.

10. LAUNCHING THE ANIMUS HUB IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF OUR JOURNEY.
The team has ambitious plans for the Animus Hub and hopes to create new opportunities to tie together the Assassin's Creed universe, our Modern Day story, and your favorite Assassin's Creed games. Launching within Assassin's Creed Shadows is merely the first step of a long journey together. The Hub will continue to evolve and grow with new features, new content, and new rewards rolling out in the months and years to come.

[Buy GitHub Account](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/). GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store their code in repositories, track changes to the code, and collaborate with others. GitHub is built on top of Git, a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (the founder of Linux), which allows multiple people to work on the same project without overriding each other’s work.

**Key features of GitHub include:**

* **Repositories:** A repository (or repo) is a place where all the files of a project are stored. It can be either private or public.
* **Version Control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/) tracks changes to code using Git. This enables developers to revert to previous versions, see a history of changes, and manage branches.
* **Branches:** Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. Once the work is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch (often called “main” or “master”).
* **Pull Requests:** When changes are made in a branch, a pull request is created to propose these changes to be merged into another branch (usually the main codebase). Pull requests allow for code reviews and discussions before merging.
* **Collaboration:** GitHub is widely used for open-source projects, where developers from around the world can contribute to a project by forking repositories and submitting pull requests.
* **Issues:** GitHub provides an issue tracker, where bugs, feature requests, and other tasks can be reported and tracked.
* **Actions:** GitHub Actions is a feature that allows automation of workflows, such as running tests, building code, or deploying applications every time code is pushed.
* **Wiki:** GitHub repositories can have a Wiki, which is useful for documenting the project.

GitHub has become the default platform for many developers and organizations because of its collaboration features, version control, and large community. It also supports integrations with other tools and services, which makes it a central hub for development workflows.

# How GitHub Account works ?

GitHub is a platform used primarily for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with other developers on projects. Here’s how a GitHub account works:

**Creating a GitHub Account**

* **Sign up:** You start by creating a free or paid GitHub account onGitHub.com. After signing up, you’ll have access to repositories (repos) where you can store your code.
* **Profile Setup:** You can personalize your profile by adding a bio, profile picture, and links to your portfolio or social media accounts.

**Repositories (Repos)**

* **Creating a Repo:** A repository is like a project folder where your code and related files are stored. You can create a public or private repository. Public repositories are visible to everyone, while private ones are only accessible to people you grant access.
* **Clone and Fork:** You can clone a repository to your local machine to work on it. You can also fork a repository, which creates your own copy of another user’s repository so you can make changes without affecting the original.
* **Commit Change:** After making changes to your code, you commit them to the repository. A commit includes a message describing the changes made.
* **Push Changes:** After committing your changes locally, you push them to GitHub, making them available on the cloud.

**Branching and Merging**

* **Branching:** GitHub allows you to create branches to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main code (usually the \`main\` or \`master\` branch). Each branch is like an independent workspace.
* **Merging:** Once changes in a branch are ready, you can merge the branch back into the main branch. This is done using pull requests (PRs), which let you review and discuss the changes before merging them.

**Collaborating with Others**

* **Pull Requests (PRs):** Pull requests allow other users to suggest changes to your project. You can review, comment, and merge changes from contributors.
* **Issues and Discussions:** You can create issues to track bugs, tasks, or features. GitHub also offers Discussions where collaborators can chat, ask questions, or plan the next steps of the project.
* **Collaborators:** You can add other users as collaborators on your repository, allowing them to make changes, manage issues, and perform other actions.

**GitHub Actions and CI/CD**  
GitHub also supports [GitHub](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/) Actions, which allows you to automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code whenever changes are made to a repository. This is part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

**GitHub Pages**  
GitHub offers a feature called GitHub [Pages](https://usaitsell.com/) to host static websites directly from your repository. This is useful for personal websites, portfolios, or project documentation.

**Security Features**

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** GitHub supports 2FA for additional security.
* **Private Repos:** You can restrict access to your code with private repositories.

**GitHub for Version Control**  
GitHub uses Git, a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code over time. Every time you commit and push changes, Git records the version. You can compare versions, roll back to previous ones, or explore the history of changes in your project.

**Integration with Other Tools**  
[GitHub](https://usaitsell.com/product/buy-github-account/) integrates with various tools, such as project management tools (Trello, Jira), code editors (VSCode, Sublime), and deployment platforms (Heroku, AWS).

**Summary of Key Features:**

* **Repositories:** Store and manage your code.
* **Branching and Merging:** Manage different versions of your code.
* **Collaborations:** Work with other developers on the same project.
* **GitHub Actions:** Automate tasks like testing and deployment.
* **GitHub Pages:** Host websites from your repository.
* **Security:** Protect your code with authentication and access controls.

By using GitHub, you can efficiently manage your coding projects, collaborate with others, and keep track of every change made to your codebase.
