EigenLayer stETH - I'm confused by the contract,CryptoTax,1i7eqsf,2025-01-22 11:14:05,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTax/comments/1i7eqsf/eigenlayer_steth_im_confused_by_the_contract/,Ok-Employ-1029,,"I've been accustomed to getting some variety of wrapped tokens whenever I stake or lend etc., but I'm looking at the Eigen contract for when I deposited stETH and it seems I didn't get some kind of Eigen stETH token in exchange. All I'm seeing is that I 'transferred' my stETH to the Eigen contract.

I can't see anything resembling an Eigen stETH token on coingecko.

So would it be right to assume that I transferred ownership of my assets to EigenLayer? 

Since it apparently wasn't a swap I'm not clear on whether that's a taxable event. I suppose transferring ownership constitutes a taxable event?"

* This graph showcases the share price of Coinbase, one of the biggest crypto related businesses and a benchmark for analyzing “big money” in crypto + related to today’s news!

**Ethereum and Layer 2 Highlights**

**Ethereum Mainnet**

* **Coinbase vs SEC Lawsuit Paused**: A U.S. judge agreed to let Coinbase appeal an important decision in its case with the SEC, putting the case on hold for now. The appeal will focus on whether the crypto assets involved count as ""investment contracts"" under securities laws. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, accusing it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency - likely, this will be an important case for the future of centralized exchanges.
* **AAVE Celebrates 5 Years**: Aave, the leading lending protocol, turned five today. Well, most likely yesterday depending on when you’re reading. Launched on January 8, 2020, it helped start DeFi Summer and grew into the biggest DeFi platform, with over $34 billion in total value locked, 13 markets, and 2.3 million users across 11 networks. Aave is now preparing to launch Aave V4 later this year.

**Arbitrum**

* **Lotte Group Partnership**: South Korea's Lotte Group has chosen Arbitrum's blockchain to develop its Lotte Caliverse, aiming to enhance Web3 entertainment experiences. Let’s see how this will pan out for the growing web3 gaming market.

**Optimism**

* **OP Price Update**: Optimism's token, OP, is trading around $2.12, with recent price fluctuations between $2.06 and $2.18. It looks like it won’t break out of here anytime soon.

**Polygon**

* **Kraken's Layer 2 Solution**: In October 2024, Kraken announced 'Ink,' a new Ethereum Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain, with its testnet expected to go live soon.
* **DIA's Lumina Testnet**: In November 2024, DIA launched the testnet for Lumina, a modular oracle designed to enhance transparency and integration, utilizing an OP stack-based Optimism solution.

Both of these products are expected to go out soon, so let’s keep an eye on them!

**Project of the Day**

**Project of the Day: Auditchain's** [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai)

**Overview:** Auditchain has rolled out [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai), a cutting-edge decentralized platform that merges blockchain and AI to elevate financial, sustainability, and crypto asset disclosures. It’s built to provide real-time validation of financial statements and control sets, introducing a fresh era of continuous auditing. This project is geared toward tackling the pain points of traditional financial reporting by integrating transparency and trust into the system.

**Significance:**

* **Regulatory Compliance:** [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) is designed to help organizations navigate the complexities of regulatory reporting with precision. This, obviously, boosts reliability in financial disclosures.
* **Support for Traditional Formats:** The platform supports machine-readable formats like XBRL and JSON, meaning it’ll be useable by most traditional accountants.
* **Incentivized Ecosystem:** With a built-in payment and rewards system using USDC, [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) incentivizes users to contribute to high-quality control sets, making the ecosystem collaborative and self-sustaining.

**Recent Update:** As of 2024, Auditchain deployed [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) on the mainnet, marking a milestone as the first blockchain-based **Regulatory Finance (RegFi)** protocol. This move bridges the gap between traditional financial frameworks and decentralized technologies, bringing millions of annual disclosures on-chain and setting a new standard for automated compliance.

\[TLDR because I made it quite blocky and long - it’s a super good product for finance professionals who want to get into blockchain.\]

**Key Takeaways**

**Ethereum Ecosystem**

* **Regulatory Landscape:** The approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a significant political issue. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin anticipates that several Ether ETF applications will receive approval, though he expects a lengthy wait before they become public. This development underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets - while multiple ETH ETFs have been launched yet, there’s still quite a few to go.
* **Research and Development:** In a notable development, Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer following a controversy. This event highlights the let’s say dynamic nature of the Ethereum development community and the challenges it faces in governance and collaboration\*\*.\*\* 

**Layer 2 Narrative**

* **Berachain's Unique Consensus:** Berachain is introducing Proof of Liquidity to enhance Ethereum’s scalability while maintaining decentralization and reducing energy consumption. This modern, fairly innovative approach targets both Ethereum’s transaction throughput and environmental concerns.

Staking Explained in Simple Terms: What It Is and How Beginners Can Earn,u_Ok_Note8852,1hvp53e,2025-01-07 06:11:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Note8852/comments/1hvp53e/staking_explained_in_simple_terms_what_it_is_and/,Ok_Note8852,,"In traditional finance, a popular way to earn passive income is by keeping money in bank deposits or low-risk investments in bonds. This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking — a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

https://preview.redd.it/1xu7ktmi1kbe1.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b6f20bc05e4cdde2acbd5082eee55f8b245028

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

The key metric when choosing a network and platform for staking is APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which reflects the annual return considering reward reinvestment. It’s important to balance rewards, network reliability, and asset volatility.

Here is a list of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies for staking as of this article’s writing, according to Staking Rewards.

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** The largest PoS blockchain with $132.4 billion locked in staking. The network offers an APY of 3.48%.
2. **Solana (SOL):** Known for high transaction speeds and low fees. $91.2 billion locked, with an APY of 6.65%.
3. **Sui (SUI):** A next-gen blockchain quickly gaining popularity. $33 billion locked, with an APY of 2.81%.
4. **Cardano (ADA):** One of the earliest and most stable PoS networks. $26 billion locked, with an APY of 2.67%.
5. **Binance Coin (BNB):** Native token of Binance Smart Chain. $21.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.22%.
6. **Tron (TRX):** One of the oldest blockchains with staking. $13 billion locked, with an APY of 4.65%.
7. **Aptos (APT):** A rapidly developing network competing with Sui. $12.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.00%.
8. **Avalanche (AVAX):** A popular ecosystem with high transaction speeds. $12.41 billion locked, with an APY of 7.79%.
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** A blockchain with unique architecture supporting parachains. $8.65 billion locked, with an APY of 11.96%.
10. **Celestia (TIA):** A modular blockchain launched in 2023. $6.12 billion locked, with an APY of 10.69%.

These projects offer unique opportunities for users wishing to earn through staking due to varying reward parameters and use cases.

These platforms offer a wide range of staking solutions, catering to both institutional and retail users. The supported networks allow every investor to find their balance between returns and risk.

# Conclusion

Staking is a way to earn passive income and actively participate in supporting blockchain operations. Its popularity is explained by energy efficiency compared to mining, ease of participation, and the potential for stable rewards.

However, participating in the network’s infrastructure requires understanding technical processes and associated risks. For beginners, staking can offer an easy and accessible way to earn, provided they use providers that lower the entry barrier and technical complexities. It's crucial to carefully choose platforms and projects to minimize potential threats.

With innovations like liquid staking and restaking, users have even more tools to manage their assets flexibly. These solutions make the process more convenient and appealing for both experienced investors and newcomers eager to integrate into the crypto ecosystem."
Analyzing where the majority of ETH is deployed/used.,ethtrader,1huyxb4,2025-01-06 08:25:38,14,0.89,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1huyxb4/analyzing_where_the_majority_of_eth_is/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Analysis,"The more I do research on Ethereum the more I understand its ecosystem is very vast. There are billions of dollars worth of ETH deployed across many different protocols. These protocols point up the diversity of Ethereum's use cases, like staking, lending, bridging, collateralized debt positions. I will break down the top 10 protocols where ETH is most used right now.

I previously wrote a post about the first 5, focusing on the TVL only, so go take a look if you're interested. Let's get into it.

Number 1. Lido (Liquid Staking). $35.227B

As expected Lido dominates the ecosystem, it's the biggest liquid staking protocol and a big contributor to ETH's liquidity.

Number 2. EigenLayer (Restaking). $16.08B

Restaking is getting a lot of traction, and EigenLayer is leading that category. EigenLayer lets people reuse their staked ETH to secure the network.

Number 3. AAVE V3 (Lending). $12.586B

AAVE is one of the biggest players in DeFi, its V3 has a lot of ETH usage. Users supply ETH as collateral to earn yield or borrow assets. AAVE brings attention to Ethereum's strength in decentralized markets.

Number 4. ether.fi Stake (Liquid Restaking). $8.083B

What makes ether.fi different is that it combines liquid staking and restaking.

Number 5. Binance Staked ETH (Liquid Staking). $7.013B

Binance's liquid staking solution attracts both institutional investors and retail, so it's great for adoption. CEXs still play a big role in ETH adoption.

Number 6. MakerDAO (Collateralized Debt Position). $4.915B

If you didn't know this MakerDAO is the pioneer of decentralized stablecoins. MakerDAO helps maintain the stability of DAI while offering a use case for ETH as a store of value. So in my opinion this is one of the most important protocols.

Number 7. Arbitrum Bridge (Chain). $4.326B

L2s thrive on scalability and the Arbitrum Bridge allows ETH to be transferred between the main net and Arbitrum.

Number 8. Base Bridge (Chain). $4.287B

Base Bridge is similar to Arbitrum in terms of ETH usage. Base is gaining a lot of traction at a fast pace.

Number 9. Spark (Lending). $3.642B

Before this research, I confess I didn't know about Spark. Like AAVE, Spark offers lending services with a focus on ETH and related assets.

Number 10. Rocket Pool (Liquid Staking). $2.714B

Even though Rocket Pool has a more decentralized approach to liquid staking, it's nowhere near Lido's dominance.

Summing up, more than half of the ETH in this list is used in staking protocols, which means investors want to earn yield from their ETH while securing the network. Ethereum is becoming more versatile and more innovative, because its protocols are giving people different ways to maximize their ETH holdings.

Analyzing Top 5 Ethereum protocols by TVL.,ethtrader,1hrsdjk,2025-01-02 07:14:31,14,0.85,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hrsdjk/analyzing_top_5_ethereum_protocols_by_tvl/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Analysis,"At the time I'm writing this the total value locked in DeFi, on the entire Ethereum ecosystem, is over $123.6 billion. At the very top, Lido leads with $33.3B TVL. This means investors really like liquid staking and its flexibility. Lido has a big role in Ethereum, especially as Ethereum is a staking-driven ecosystem.

After Lido, we have Aave, a lending protocol. It's got $21.3B TVL . Aave is the number one choice for borrowing and lending in DeFi. It's consistently driving more adoption and liquidity also.

Number 3 is one of the most interesting protocols to me: EigenLayer. It's already at $15B TVL despite being kind of new. Apparently restaking has a lot of attention now. An interesting thing to note is that EigenLayer only has 5 active developers every month. Also from my research EIGEN will unlock 10.9% of its supply in 3 months. I'm still wondering if this protocol will be sustainable in the long run.

After EigenLayer, we have ether.fi, that holds $8.3B TVL. Last one in this top 5 is Binance staked ETH with $6.2B TVL. Clearly CEXs have a lot of influence in the staking market.

The one that caught my attention was definitely EigenLayer, it's showing how innovation continues to bring a lot of adoption. I wonder which protocol will be the most relevant in DeFi this year.

What is $XAR?

$XAR is the native token of the Arcana Network, built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. It powers Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol, ensuring the security and growth of its ecosystem. With $XAR, holders can actively participate in the network by staking their tokens directly on the Arcana platform. Stakers earn rewards as a way to encourage engagement and support Arcana’s decentralized infrastructure.

In the Chain Abstraction Protocol, $XAR goes beyond simple transactions. It plays a key role in securing the network. Holders can stake $XAR with validator pools on the Arcana Appchain, strengthening the network’s crypto-economic security. Stakers also earn rewards based on their contributions. To encourage early adoption, Arcana offers front-loaded rewards from its existing token supply, transitioning to fee-funded rewards in the long term.

Arcana also plans to enhance trust in its protocol with cryptographic solutions by integrating platforms like EigenLayer or verification hubs such as Avail Nexus. These innovations will further strengthen Arcana’s network security. 

How $XAR is Used
Transaction Fees: $XAR is used to pay for network transaction fees, compensating validators for securing the network.

Staking Rewards: Users can stake $XAR to help secure the network and earn rewards.

Treasury Pool: Part of transaction fees is directed to a treasury pool for rewards, ecosystem growth, and inflation management.

Validator Slashing: Validators who harm the network are penalized, protecting users and maintaining security.

Governance: $XAR holders can vote on protocol updates and other key decisions.

Value Growth for $XAR
Buyback/Burn Mechanism: Arcana may burn $XAR to reduce supply, increasing its scarcity and value.
Subscription Tiers: $XAR unlocks premium services within Arcana’s ecosystem.

Priority Access: High-level stakers get faster transactions and exclusive features.

Discounted Fees: Payments made in $XAR enjoy lower fees, encouraging usage.

Driving Security and Innovation in Arcana’s Chain Abstraction,ICOCryptoInfo,1ho6rdp,2024-12-28 09:29:52,4,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICOCryptoInfo/comments/1ho6rdp/driving_security_and_innovation_in_arcanas_chain/,Cupidmove,,"The launch of the Arcana Wallet Beta, powered by Arcana’s Modular L1 blockchain, has redefined multichain asset management, making it simpler and more user-friendly. At the heart of this innovation lies $XAR, Arcana’s native token, which fuels the Chain Abstraction Protocol, driving its core functionality, governance, and ecosystem growth. With the Testnet release of Arcana's Chain Abstraction, the true potential and utility of $XAR are now coming to light.

What is $XAR?
$XAR is the native token of the Arcana Network. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, it plays a critical role in securing and scaling the ecosystem. One of its primary functions is staking, where $XAR holders can stake their tokens on the Arcana platform to earn additional rewards. This incentivizes active community participation and enhances the decentralized infrastructure.

In Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol, $XAR is pivotal for boosting network security. By staking $XAR with validator pools on the Arcana Appchain, holders not only enhance the network's crypto-economic security but also earn rewards proportional to their stake. Initially, these rewards are funded through Arcana’s token supply, with long-term rewards transitioning to protocol fees.

To further strengthen trust, Arcana plans to integrate cryptographic solutions like EigenLayer for restaking and verification hubs such as Avail Nexus. Together, these measures will ensure the protocol’s security, sustainability, and value.

$XAR Utilities in the Ecosystem

Transaction Fees: $XAR is used for transaction fees, rewarding validators who secure and maintain the network.
Staking and Rewards: Holders can stake $XAR to secure the network and earn staking rewards.

Treasury and Inflation Management: A portion of transaction fees funds the treasury pool, supporting rewards and ecosystem development while managing inflation.

Validator Accountability: Slashing mechanisms penalize validators for malicious behavior, protecting network integrity.

Governance: $XAR holders participate in decision-making, shaping protocol updates and improvements.

In essence, $XAR is the backbone of Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol, ensuring security, scalability, and community-driven growth. With its expanding utility and integrations, $XAR is set to unlock new opportunities across Arcana’s ecosystem.

gm! This will be the last newsletter of 2024 since I'm going to be enjoying some time off to celebrate the holidays 🎄

If 2024 was any sign of what the future holds for Solana, 2025 is going to be even better. I'm glad I'm on this ride with you and I can't wait to kick off the new year and to keep bringing you everything you need to know to build on Solana!

Now, let's take a look at what 🎅 has in his bag for all you good developers…

# 🔌 Electric Capital Developer Report

For the first time Solana has overtaken Ethereum as the #1 blockchain for new developers, according to [Electric Capital's 2024 Developer Report](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=developer-report&ref=blog.colosseum.org). 

Out of 39,000 developers exploring crypto this year, over 7,600 chose to build on Solana. This marks an 83% year-over-year increase in new developer activity for the Solana ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/gsnnj3jh8v7e1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=151334b88f805838ce865707aa1a9804e40012e6

Solana has built momentum over the past year, even through price volatility and market cycles, and the work is starting to show. 

The report highlights a few overlooked wins for Solana:

* Solana handled 81% of all DEX transactions across all blockchains this year.
* It surpassed Ethereum in total DEX settlement volume, hitting $574 billion for the year.
* Adoption is scaling quickly where 1.7 million unique wallets transacted on Solana in 2024, 7x more than any other chain.

While Ethereum remains the largest ecosystem overall and continues to dominate in total active developers, Solana’s growth signals where the next generation of builders is headed. 

The report also points to a larger global trend of developer activity spreading out across continents, with Asia leading the way. 

India, in particular, onboarded the most new crypto developers this year, and Solana is now the top ecosystem for developers in the region.

For Solana developers, this is validation. The ecosystem is thriving and attracting more builders and real-world adoption than ever.

# 📅 Solana Events in 2025

The Solana Foundation is prioritizing Community-led events that bring together developers, founders, validators, product managers, and strategists to build, iterate, and connect in ways that drive actual results.

The schedule for 2025 includes several key opportunities for developers.

In May, two flagship events in New York City will anchor the American crypto scene, starting with a highly selective, application-only conference for those deeply engaged in building on Solana.

This event will be followed by a larger conference welcoming the U.S. crypto industry as a whole and introducing a new audience to what's happening in the Solana ecosystem.

Around the world, APEX events will take place in major cities like Mexico City, Cape Town, Budapest, Singapore, and Mumbai, each designed to highlight high-quality applications tailored to local communities.

Startup Villages, inspired by the success of gatherings like mtnDAO, will provide extended periods for developers and entrepreneurs to work together, refine products, participate in workshops, and form lasting connections.

Community-led hacker houses and independent conferences will continue to offer spaces for builders to meet, experiment, and share knowledge.

Finally, Breakpoint 2025 in Abu Dhabi remains the ultimate moment for the ecosystem, bringing the global Solana community together to celebrate achievements and set the course for the future.

# 🎩 MagicBlock Ephemeral Validator

MagicBlock has open-sourced the [MagicBlock Ephemeral Validator](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/ephemeral-validator?ref=blog.colosseum.org), a lightweight, non-voting SVM runtime designed to replace traditional Web2 servers.

Ephemeral Validators work by cloning accounts just-in-time within ultra-fast SVM instances, executing tasks, and updating the mainnet state upon completion.

The validator enables real-time, elastic computing directly on Solana, eliminating the need for centralized servers by implementing application logic entirely on-chain.

The core innovation lies in Ephemeral Rollups, which extend Solana by offering serverless, elastic compute.

This allows for fully on-chain real-time applications, such as gaming, decentralized social networks, and high-frequency finance, while maintaining all smart contract logic and state on Solana.

This open-source release marks the beginning of a multi-month effort to fully develop and open-source MagicBlock.

This is huge for oracles, immediate trust, no native token economics needed, and resilience against economic attacks.

But this raises some interesting questions:

1. **Validator Risks**: Could AVSs incentivize behavior that conflicts with Ethereum's core consensus (e.g., slashing cascades or resource exhaustion)?
2. **Slashing Mechanisms**: How can AVSs ensure that penalties don't unfairly propagate across restaked services?
3. **Centralization Concerns**: If AVSs heavily depend on Ethereum validators, does this increase centralization pressure in the long run?

I'd love to hear thoughts from the community! Are there real-world examples where this model shines (e.g., oracles, DA layers)? And do you see any long-term risks that could impact Ethereum's overall security?

Comparing and Contrasting Rollups and EigenLayer as Ethereum Scalability Solutions (x-post from /r/Cryptocurrency),CryptoCurrencyClassic,1hfb8gc,2024-12-15 23:33:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hfb4mz/comparing_and_contrasting_rollups_and_eigenlayer/,ASICmachine,,
Comparing and Contrasting Rollups and EigenLayer as Ethereum Scalability Solutions,CryptoCurrency,1hfb4mz,2024-12-15 23:27:17,0,0.29,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hfb4mz/comparing_and_contrasting_rollups_and_eigenlayer/,aminok,SCALABILITY,"Actively Validated Services (AVS) secured via EigenLayer, and rollups verified by Ethereum Mainnet, both expand Ethereum's capabilities, but they do so in distinct ways. EigenLayer introduces restaking, enabling Ethereum validators to leverage their staked ETH to secure additional protocols (AVS) beyond Ethereum itself. This creates a shared security model, making it more capital-efficient for new protocols by removing the need to establish their own validator networks, while aligning the success of new protocols with ETH's success as money, which in turn reinforces the security of the entire set of ETH-secured protocols. \[1\]

In contrast, rollups improve Ethereum's scalability by executing transactions off-chain while publishing data and executing proofs on Ethereum Mainnet for verification. Optimistic rollups operate on the assumption of validity unless proven otherwise \[2\], whereas zkRollups use zero-knowledge cryptography to actively prove validity. \[3\]

These two approaches to scalability involve different trade-offs, with rollups driving Ethereum-native scalability and EigenLayer extending ETH's cryptoeconomic security across the broader blockchain ecosystem.

A fully onchain rollup is Ethereum-native scaling, where more transactions can be processed within Ethereum's blockspace, and within Ethereum's consensus, thus maintaining the full security and interoperability of onchain Ethereum transactions.

But when the demands of an application exceed what fully onchain rollups can accommodate due to Ethereum's capacity constraints, e.g. the current blobspace capacity, EigenLayer-based solutions, like the offchain data availability protocol, EigenDA \[4\], provide an alternative. EigenDA doesn't store data on Ethereum but as an AVS, it is secured by restaked ETH, aligning more closely with Ethereum's ecosystem than entirely separate offchain data availability protocols. This complementary relationship between rollups and EigenLayer-powered AVS enables Ethereum to support a broader range of applications: rollups for tightly integrated, high-security scaling and EigenLayer for extending Ethereum’s security to applications demanding scalability beyond the limits of pure rollups. Together, they maximize Ethereum’s utility and reinforce its position as the foundation of decentralized applications.

I've been pondering for the past 2-ish years if I should use this service or not and recently decided to jump.

I used their service through Ledger (which has a pretty shitty integration in my opinion, but that's another story)

https://preview.redd.it/lr4sdlfrze6e1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=536224132791989900890d13c532fec4b1b45274

My dashboard suggests a constant 2.35% reward rate even though when creating a node and everywhere else on the network the reward is around ±3.4% (3.51% at the moment

https://preview.redd.it/hukdaqujze6e1.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9cbe4bb158c6f1deefafefc92d58cf2447512c2

I understand what trailing average means but the shown reward rates have been constant for the past 2 weeks since I made my dedicated node.

So where is this coming from, even with the 8% that Kiln is taking 3.51% \* 0.92 = 3.2%

So again, just to clarify, I'm getting a constant 2.35% per day every day, it's not like I'm getting 3.5 and 15 days with 3.5% + 15 days with 0% average out to 2.35% because the age of my node is 15 days.

Are there some graphs or some information I'm missing here, can anyone help me with guiding me on learning what I'm missing here?

Thanks."

Well, I asked chatgpt why Hedera is performing this well without being on their leaderboard. This was the result. Guys were just getting started. Yesterday was mainly institutional money pouring in. Just wait until she flips into the top 10 and breaks into the trending leaderboard. We're number 50 right now!! Very little social engagement. Let's share this post and wake the people up!

The Flippening 2024


""Hedera (HBAR) has recently experienced a significant price increase, yet it may not appear among the top 50 trending cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. This discrepancy can be attributed to CoinMarketCap's trending algorithm, which considers factors such as user engagement, search frequency, and page views over specific time frames. Therefore, even with substantial price movements, a cryptocurrency might not rank highly in trending lists if it hasn't garnered sufficient user interest or activity on the platform during the evaluated period.

Additionally, CoinMarketCap's trending section often highlights newer or lesser-known cryptocurrencies that attract sudden interest, while more established assets like HBAR may not experience the same spikes in user engagement. Consequently, despite HBAR's notable price performance, it might not feature prominently in the trending rankings due to these algorithmic considerations.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to consult multiple sources and consider various metrics beyond trending lists, such as market capitalization, trading volume, and recent news developments.""

Trying to understand the risk of staking,Bitstamp,1h587sf,2024-12-02 17:47:01,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitstamp/comments/1h587sf/trying_to_understand_the_risk_of_staking/,arch_raul,,"I know it's difficult to answer but what is the risk of staking on Bitstamp, say, compared to competitors? If you read through the Bitstamp staking FAQ it warns you about all kinds of things, including this scary sentence: ""Staking may result in losses amounting from 1 to 32 staked ETH"". Do they need to state that for some legal reasons or is it actually a realistic possibility? Like if I stake 10 ETH today then tomorrow BAM it's all gone! Makes me worried. On the other hand, they also mention how they use ""well-known and established node validators"" which calms me down a bit.

If you look at Coinbase FAQ on staking (https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/coinbase-staking/staking/staking-risks) it looks much more reassuring. They mention that there are risks but that it's overall very safe and importantly, ""to date, no customer has lost any staked crypto"". Is Coinbase better at this or is it mostly a matter of wording?

I've also looked into Kraken but they don't spell out the staking risks so clearly. I did find this though: ""Kraken subsidiary Staked is the validator for ETH restaked using Kraken. Staked is a leading EigenLayer operator whose services are usually only available to their institutional clients"". Sound pretty reassuring.

I see Bitstamp has been getting a lot of heat for slow customer support and some transactions being stalled (I have a ticket open myself) but putting all that aside, are there any real differences between these platforms when it comes to the security of the fundamental services they provide?"

$XAR: The Power Behind Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Revolution,TokenFinders,1gxvlcb,2024-11-23 04:08:55,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokenFinders/comments/1gxvlcb/xar_the_power_behind_arcanas_chain_abstraction/,Strange-Tea-7781,,"At the heart of the Arcana Network's Chain Abstraction Protocol lies our native token, $XAR, designed to fuel the protocol's functionality and drive ecosystem growth. With the launch of our Testnet, $XAR is set to unlock its full utility potential, serving as the cornerstone of Arcana's infrastructure. Here's a closer look at the mechanics and benefits of $XAR.

What is $XAR?

$XAR is the foundational token of the Arcana Network, built as an ERC20 token on Ethereum. It powers the Chain Abstraction Protocol by supporting core functionalities such as transactions, staking, security, and governance.

Beyond basic transactions, $XAR enables holders to actively participate in Arcana's ecosystem. Users can stake $XAR on the Arcana platform to earn competitive yields while contributing to the security of the protocol by delegating their tokens to validator pools on Arcana’s Appchain. In the early stages, staking rewards are distributed from Arcana’s token supply, but in the long term, these rewards will be sustained through the protocol's collected fees.

Staking also reinforces crypto-economic security within the Chain Abstraction Protocol. Arcana aims to amplify this security further through integrations with advanced platforms like EigenLayer and Avail Nexus, enhancing cryptographic trust.

Key Utilities of $XAR
1. Transaction Fees
$XAR will serve as the medium for paying transaction fees across the Chain Abstraction Protocol. Validators securing the network are compensated through these fees, ensuring a seamless and efficient system.

2. Staking & Rewards
Users can stake $XAR to earn rewards, making it a dual-purpose utility token. Validators and delegators are incentivized to support the network’s security while benefiting from long-term staking yields.

3. Treasury Pool & Inflation Management
A percentage of the transaction fees is allocated to a treasury pool. This pool is essential for managing rewards, supporting early ecosystem development, and controlling inflation as the network scales. This mechanism ensures sustainability while balancing incentives for stakeholders.

4. Slashing Mechanism for Security
To maintain the integrity of the Chain Abstraction Protocol, Arcana employs a slashing mechanism. Validators who violate network rules face penalties, safeguarding user funds and preserving the network's trustworthiness.

5. Governance Participation
$XAR holders play an integral role in Arcana’s evolution. Through governance participation, holders can vote on key decisions, updates, and protocol improvements, ensuring a community-driven and decentralized development process.

The Future of $XAR
$XAR is more than just a token; it is the backbone of Arcana’s mission to streamline chain abstraction and enable scalable, interoperable blockchain experiences. As Arcana continues to grow, $XAR will remain central to driving innovation, security, and collaboration within the decentralized ecosystem.

Join the revolution with #ArcanaNetwork and explore the full potential of $XAR as we redefine blockchain interoperability and usability.

发链平台大盘点，Move发链新星冉冉升起？,StarcoinSTC,1guvjyv,2024-11-19 07:02:45,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarcoinSTC/comments/1guvjyv/发链平台大盘点move发链新星冉冉升起/,Zestyclose-Ad2074,,"要点：

1. 一键发链技术趋于成熟，各类L1和L2链开始涌现；
2. 原生合约已无法满足生态应用需求，大型应用纷纷开始部署自己的应用链；
3. 发链市场逐步分为独立L1和L2两大阵营，L1更强调区块链的定制化和独立性，而L2更依赖于以太坊生态的发展；
4. 模块化已经成为独立区块链构建的方向，快速、定制化、灵活性成为市场构建区块链的主要需求；
5. 更低成本、高效以及可定制化的区块链发链平台逐步替代Polkadot等发链平台。

# 引言

人们常说区块链行业的发展仍处于早期，基础设施、上层应用、模式创新仍有很大的空间，但经过近几年的发展，行业的基础设施快速完善，从最开始的一键发币，但现在的一键发链模式都已经相当成熟。特别是在一键发链方面，经过几代发链技术的迭代，目前搭建一条主网已经变得触手可及，并且在主网性能、安全性、去中心化、数据存储、共识机制以及应用构建等方面非常完善，可供选择的空间也很大。

无论是想自己搭建一条Layer1，还是在以太坊生态上做一条Layer2，甚至Layer3都可以轻松实现。对部分需要特定化场景的应用来说，应用链的出现也足以满足其需求。例如去中心化衍生平台dYdX就基于Cosmos SDK开发了应用链dYdX Chain。

本报告将综合分析各大发链平台的技术演进、优劣势对比、发展现状，以及目前市场对于发链平台的需求。市场是否真是有一键发链需求？对应用而言选择智能合约搭建Dapp更好，还是做一条自己的应用链更佳？一键发链的未来趋势在哪里，还有哪些不足需要完善？

# 1. 市场对发链的需求

市场对发链需求根本上是来自于应用层，Web3的叙事是 \[Next Billion User\]，而要承载这么多用户，单凭一条链根本支撑不起这样一个现象级的应用。从Axie Infinity开发团队Sky Mavis搭建Ronin就可以明显看出，Ronin被创建的原因是为了解决Axie Infinity游戏中的一些问题，如以太坊网络的拥堵和高昂的Gas费。作为以太坊的侧链，Ronin独立运行，并旨在为游戏提供可靠、快速和经济实惠的保障，同时避免主链的扩容问题。

而市场中能像Sky Mavis这样有专业技术背景和开发能力的团队并不多，大部分团队没有办法独立开发并运行一条公链，并且还能确保其性能和安全性。这就衍生出一键发链的市场需求。综合来看，市场对发链的需求包括以下几点：

# 1.1 应用市场需求

我们可以看到很多大体量的应用都存在这样的需求，例如Uniswap Labs在10月11日推出Unichain，作为基于OP Stack技术搭建的Layer2，Unichain交易速度更快，成本更低，并且通过OP的Superchain生态增强其流动性。

对于很多成熟的应用来说，自己搭建一条应用链可以摆脱原生主网的诸多限制，获得更大的自主权，并且还能独享整个网络的计算和存储资源，有助于应用突破增长瓶颈，实现更大的突破。

# 1.2 独立公链开发需求

现在关于发链讨论最多的无疑是Layer2，其中以Optimism的OP Stack和Arbitrum Orbit为代表，借助Raas（Rollups-as-a-Service）服务，开发一条Layer2链变得非常简单。但仍有很多开发团队有定制共识机制、开发语言、网络访问权限、VM（虚拟机）以及链上治理等方面的需求。例如，共识上采用PoW，开发语言上采用更安全的Move，网络权限方面需要授权才能访问等。 

# 1.3 企业区块链化转型

随着Web3基础设施的不断完善，传统互联网企业也面临着区块链化的转型需求，企业希望通过区块链进行供应链管理、数据共享、资产追踪等，此时一键发链技术的成熟，就可以满足企业部署自己私有链或联盟链的需求，而不需要重复发明轮子。

# 1.4 政府和监管机构的需求

 一些国家的政府和监管机构希望采用区块链技术进行数字身份管理、智能合同执行、电子政务管理等。通过一键发链，这些机构能够快速创建区块链网络，并根据需要进行定制，推动技术在公共服务中的应用。

# 2. 发链技术的演进：飞入寻常百姓家

在我们谈论Web3应用春天的时候，发链的需求就早已经出现，从最开始的各类分叉项目，如BOS、Meetone、Telos这些fork了EOS代码的链；再到直接Copy以太坊的代码的一些山寨公链，如币安链。这些虽然谈不上真正意义的一键发链，但可以看出市场对发行一条自己公链的迫切需求。

而真正的一键发链，应该从Cosmos和Polkadot说起。其中在Cosmos上发链，可以用Cosmos SDK进行构建，然后通过IBC协议进行链与链之间的通信，而Polkadot则是通过Polkadot SDK工具包进行构建平行链，然后通过零层协议中继链实现互操作性和共享安全性。Cosmos和Polkadot的架构和设计目的，试图建立区块链之间的桥梁，最终建立一个区块链互联网。

但要真正实现简单快捷的一键发链，它们仍存在许多不足之处。例如，要在Polkadot上开发平行链，首先需要通过质押其原生代币DOT，然后竞拍获得中继链的卡槽，卡槽数量有限，而发链的市场需求很大，所以竞拍的成本非常的高。据数据显示，在Polkadot的首轮卡槽竞拍中，前5名锁定的DOT就超过了9900万，接近供应总量的10%，其中第一名Moonbeam锁定了35,759,931 DOT，按当时价格计算约为1.35亿美元。由于只有5个资格，第5名Clover锁定了9,752,487 DOT，按当时价格计算约为37,059,452美元。简单说来，当时要在Polkadot上发一条平行链最低需要锁定3705万美元的资产，所以成本是非常之高。

[ https:\/\/parachains.info\/auctions\/polkadot-1-5](https://preview.redd.it/garp9i5kjt1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c9cea2c18fafe95366181169b47b4f6742984da)

但随着以Optimism和Arbitrum为代表的模块化L2出现，简单快捷的一键发链逐步成为现实。开发者可以用其提供的工具包直接进行开发，配置链的众多组件，如吞吐量、隐私、gas 令牌、治理、预编译、数据可用性层等，共享主网安全性和通信层。开发者无需独自构建强大的节点网络和数据存储系统，网络的安全、计算和数据存储均可以通过其他分支网络提供。并且和生态中的其他链通信，互享流动性，增强了互操作性，打破了孤立的流动性壁垒。

除开EVM生态，基于Move开发的语言的一键发链平台Starcoin，也迅速成为新一代发链平台的代表。StarStack是其开发框架，它能够提供更灵活、定制化、独立的区块链设计方案。如共识机制上可以选择PoW或PoS，虚拟机支持Move构建，链上治理模块和参数可以自定义，并且区块链的访问权限也可以根据开发者需求定制。

特别值得注意的是Starcoin提出了AI+Web3智能发链的概念，它正在开发一套接入AI的对话式发链系统，即开发者可以通过对话的形式提出需求和修改意见，由AI完成合约部署以及相关参数设置，这极大的降低了一键发链的门槛，让非技术人员也可以操作系统，发布自己的L1区块链。

# 3. 发链平台分析：轻量级链更受到市场青睐

一键发链从概念走向落地是从2018年开始， Polkadot 推出的 Substrate 支持 15 分钟创建一条区块链，解决了创建公链的技术难题。与此同时，Cosmos SDK 也在不断完善之中，低调地参与竞争。

再后来 Polygon、Avalanche、Starcoin、Rollup技术方案等纷纷加入了发链市场的竞争，为开发者提供了快速开发区块链的工具，针对不同的需求优化参数，从而让创建一条区块链变得简单且高效。

# 3.1 Polkadot

Polkadot 是最先崛起的发链平台，它的方案是中继链+平行链。中继链是一种零层协议，负责网络的安全、共识和交易处理；平行链通过Polkadot Substrate进行构建，专注于高度灵活和定制化的协议搭建，每条平行链都可以有自己的参数，如出块时间、交易手续费、治理机制和挖矿奖励。

https://preview.redd.it/e079suzelu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=45ad202eb4c0e158b3ed9659d41363a44cdf2666

Substrate是一个可扩展、模块化、开源的区块链框架，它实现了区块链开发中遇到大部分常用功能，比如p2p网络、共识算法、常用加密算法、数据存储、交易管理等。同时，Substrate将区块链相关的业务逻辑进行了抽象，开发人员可以只需要关心业务逻辑相关的实现，这让组合和定制区块链功能变得轻松。

Substrate由区块链科技公司Parity Technologies创建，该公司由Gavin Wood创建，他是以太坊的联合创始人之一，也是波卡的创始人。

Substrate在进行区块链开发中有许多优势：

* 模块化：Substrate 通过提供开放的 SDK，以及可以组合、复用和发布的实用组件，让开发者可以非常轻松地创建、组合和发布组件以形成业务逻辑。
* 多层架构：Substrate 的三层结构分别是 Substrate Core、Substrate SRML 和 Substrate Node。
* Substrate Core 是用于构建区块链最小框架的模块，可以提供像存储、共识、交易队列和区块生产机制和低级 JavaScript 的实用程序等模块；SRML 层则更简单，开发者要做的就是从模块中选择自己需要的组别建进行参数设置即可；Substrate Node，只需提供 JSON 配置文件即可获得完整的智能合约区块链。
* 无分叉升级：Substrate 支持无分叉的 Runtime 升级。基于 Substrate 的链中存储着 WebAssembly Blob 或 WASM Blob，包含链构建新区块所需的所有逻辑，链本身的 Runtime 包含在此 WASM Blob 中，如果需要修改区块链的相关信息，只需要结合链上治理公投，倘若票数通过，即可完成相应的升级，从而减少了硬分叉带来的影响。

Polkadot 有社区精神领袖，还有完善的开发工具以及丰富的生态扶持，所以在 2020 年牛市里吸引了大量开发者进来，但是 Polkadot 的发展势头在迅速崛起之后很快就此打住。

直接原因是 Polkadot 生态的投资机构更注重短期回报，因此长期持币者基本都损失惨重，同时由于以上提到的成本问题，让很多开发者望而止步。但根本原因是生态内的项目进展整体不及预期，而且那些应用也没有到非它不可的程度。

其实还有一个隐性的限制，那就是最多只支持 100 个平行链，劝退了潜在的新开发者进来。而且在 Gavin Wood 辞去 Polkadot 生态开发组织 Parity Technologies 的 CEO 之后，Polkadot 未来重新起飞的难度相当大。

# 3.2 Cosmos

与Polkadot相比，Cosmos生态发展相当全面。据Coingekco统计，收录的Cosmos生态项目就达到162个，市值前100的项目中，Cosmos 生态占12个，如前段时间热门的Celestia、Injective、Sei 都来自Cosmos，还有之前超百亿市值的Luna。

https://preview.redd.it/lc9l5o5jlu1e1.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=f220b80c73327abc892dd40e5160523e01539c2d

Cosmos SDK是一个用于构建多资产公共权益证明（PoS）的开源工具包区块链，使用 Cosmos SDK 构建的区块链通常被称为特定于应用程序的区块链，即我们所说的应用链（dApp Chain）。

现在主流的应用都是基于以太坊等虚拟机构建的，开发者通过智能合约构建去中心化应用，但由于底层平台存在瓶颈，应用在灵活性、主权和性能方面可能受到限制，所以不适合构建复杂的应用。

Cosmos的应用链就是专为运行单个应用程序而定制的区块链，开发者在构建时有更多的选择，还可以提供更好的主权、安全性和性能。但不足的是流动性分散，安全性被孤立，不能像Polkadot那样共享安全性，同时开发者生态系统也需要独立构建。

# 3.3 Avalanche

Avalanche 给自己的定义是：一个适合部署 Dapp 和企业级区块链的开放平台，开发者可以部署自己的L1（之前称为Subnets，子网）。

Avalanche L1是一个可定制的验证器网络，可为生态系统中的一个或多个区块链达成共识。L1独立于Avalanche主网运行，有自己的执行系统，确保不会争夺资源。L1的验证者必须先加入主网，至少质押2000 AVAX才能参与。

https://preview.redd.it/gkfj2kwmlu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5bc94b47c0261e258463a670ab390c70283c20

Avalanche L1通过减少主网络的流量来提高区块链的可扩展性，从而加快交易速度并降低气体费用。它们提供广泛的定制选项，包括对验证器要求、代币结构和权限设置的控制等。

值得一提的是，Avalanche的L1架构走的是合规路线，它要求验证者满足相关合规条件，例如验证者必须位于给定的国家/地区，必须通过 KYC/AML 检查，必须持有特定许可证等。

同时，它还支持创建私有区块链，只有某些预定义的验证者可以加入，其中区块链的内容只有这些验证者可见，这满足了部分希望保持信息私密项目的需求。

# 3.4 Starcoin

Starcoin是一个基于Move语言，专注于高性能、可定制化Layer1区块链的一键智能部署方案，开发者可以用StarStack进行区块链的开发。StarStack是一个以模块化为核心的开源代码库，用于构建定制化的Layer1，开发者可以使用此代码库启动Move虚拟机，运行自己的区块链，未来也可以用其AI智能系统以对话形式进行区块链的部署。

与其他发链平台不同，StarStack在安全性、网络性能、共识机制以及灵活性等方面都有独特的优势，这样让它成为唯一一个开发者可以完全定制化开发的区块链发行平台。

StarStack技术框架的优势在于：

1） 基于Move语言和虚拟机构建。StarStack的底层框架和智能合约通过Move语言编写，虚拟机也是采用的Move，面向对象和基于资产的编程，使得资源在模块中具有极高的透明度，而对模块的外部调用则完全不透明。Move语言也被称为最安全的和灵活的智能合约语言，这也为其一键发链方案在定制化Layer1时，提供了更多的空间。

2） 基于DAG结构。StarStack中引入了DAG结构，并结合自身创新推出FlexiDAG，对 PoW 共识机制进行了升级，动态调整出块时间、难度和出块奖励。通过FlexiDAG将加快出块速度，缩短交易确认时间，大幅提升了 网络性能和系统效率。此外，关键参数可以通过链上治理机制进行动态调整，使系统更具适应性和灵活性。

3） 并行化高性能网络。在StarStack中，引入了基于高性能多线程的内存计算引擎 TurboSTM，彻底改变了智能合约的执行方式。TurboSTM 利用多版本并发控制（MVCC）和乐观锁，实现同步数据读取和及时更新，大幅减少了执行瓶颈，提高了交易吞吐量。这也使得网络性能有了质的飞跃，根据官方测试环境数据，最高TPS可以达到130,000，这个数据已经是行业公链天花板了。

4） 兼容Move生态主流应用。近期观察到，Starcoin通过Move V7版本的升级，实现了Move生态应用的全面兼容，使开发者无需重写代码即可轻松迁移和部署他们的 dApp。简单来说，就是通过Starcoin发行的Layer1，可以兼容Move生态的内的大部分应用，例如在Aptos上开发的应用可以轻松的迁移至新的Layer1上，而无需修改原始代码。当然，这也同样适用于使用StarStack开发的区块链，所以这对想要布局Move生态的开发者来说提供了极大的便利。

# 3.5 L2发链平台

L2发链平台以Optimism、Polygon、Arbitrum为代表，同时也包含zkSync、Starknet，它们主要是面向有以太坊生态开发需求的用户，发行L2链，真正意义上来说不算是一条完全独立的区块链。因为它的共识机制、VM、处理性能以及gas费都严重依赖以太坊的架构，并且在可扩展性方面也存在许多不足。

# 4. 技术差异对比：灵活性和定制化成为趋势！

通过上面对各个发链平台的分析可以看出，每个平台都有自己的特点，在模块化、定制化、安全性、网络性能等方面均有不同的取舍。例如，以应用为重心的项目可以选择Cosmos构建自己的应用链；如果看重以太坊生态的发展和安全性，那么可以选择OP、Arbitrum或者Polygon构建自己的Layer2链；如果看好Move生态的发展，那么可以选择基于Starcoin构建一条独立的Move公链。

但从发链的目的出发，我们需要思考符合开发者搭建一条公链的需要是什么？是为数百万用户提供高TPS、超低gas、流畅的商用级服务，还是为一个企业提供高定制化、参数灵活、具备权限管理的内部系统。

下面我们将从共识机制、互操作性、网络性能和交易成本、VM等角度对各个发链平台进行综合比较，看下各个发链平台的优劣所在。

# 4.1 共识机制

在共识上，大部分发链平台都采用的是PoS，通过质押原生代币确保网络的安全性和去中心化，当然也有一些小的不同，如Polkadot采用的是NPOS（提名权益证明），Cosmos采用的是PoS+BFT（拜占庭容错）结合得共识机制。当然也有一些项目兼容PoW和PoS，如Starcoin。

PoS不需要实体矿机，不会消耗大量的复杂计算能力和电力，相对来说更环保、节能，因为不需要复杂计算，通常来说交易速度会更快。但在确保去中心化和安全方面，PoS也需要更多的节点参与网络维护，类似以太坊就拥有一个庞大的节点网络。

而PoW作为第一代共识机制，通过计算哈希函数的复杂度来增加攻击难度，攻击者需要消耗巨大的算力和电力来控制网络，因而网络更难以被恶意控制。同时，PoW在去中心化方面表现突出，小规模的项目可以用一台电脑、一台手机，甚至是一个网络宽带就可以参与挖矿，大规模的可以采用专业的矿机。目前，PoW 是最早被广泛采用的共识机制，已在多个区块链上成功运行了多年，在安全性和去中心化方面表现优异。

# 4.2 网络性能

理论上网络性能与交易成本成反比关系，性能越高交易成本越低，而这里所说的性能主要是TPS和BPS。据统计Polkadot每条平行链的TPS仅为1000，虽然比一些老牌的公链更有优势，但作为能承载更多Web3应用的公链来说显然是不够的。

而作为以太坊扩容方案的L2也不尽人意，Optimism和Arbitrum理论最大TPS分别为714 tx/s和40,000 tx/s，而记录的最大TPS表现为67.41 tx/s和944 tx/s。

https://preview.redd.it/8yx4qvculu1e1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e3c531992d0c1e9ac6b99ce2a924d9686c1e10

[https://chainspect.app/compare/arbitrum-vs-optimism](https://chainspect.app/compare/arbitrum-vs-optimism)

同时在Gas费方面，虽然相对以太坊有了极大降低，但Optimism发送ETH的gas为0.09美元，交易的gas为0.18美元；Arbitrum发送ETH的gas为0.09美元，交易的gas为0.27美元。这个价格相对于Solana、BSC等一众L1来说已经相当高了。

https://preview.redd.it/psx4gvrvlu1e1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ddc2f89e35f5c952772d32359038a30528bafb

[https://l2fees.info/](https://l2fees.info/)

Polygon理论的最大TPS为649 tx/s，Avlanche理论最大TPS为357 tx/s，均没有超过1000。但基于Move语言开发的Starcoin近期观察到它升级了主网2.0，TPS最大理论值达到130,000 tx/s，这相当的惊人，与目前统计的发链平台相比，已经是断层式领先，当然由于2.0主网仍在试运行阶段，所以在正式环境下是否真能达到恐怖的13万还有待验证，但打个对折，能超过50,000 TPS也已经是性能公链的龙头了。

同时，在BPS（每秒出块数）上也有不同的差异。我们知道区块生成速度直接的影响交易速度，出块速度越快，意味着同样区块大小的情况下可打包的交易越多，同时交易确认速度也越快。其中，Polygon 2.13s/block，Avalanche 2.05s/block，Polkadot 6s/block，Starcoin 1s/block，可以看出Starcoin在这方面还是明显优于其他公链的，而Polkadot这方面落后较大。

# 4.3 VM虚拟机

我们知道VM是在区块链中是执行智能合约，计算gas消耗的作用，所有的dApp都需要虚拟机才能正常运行。

Polygon、Optimism、Arbitrum、Avalanche采用的是以太坊的虚拟机EVM，采用Solidity开发语言编写，它可以支持字节码兼容的智能合约的能力使其能够跨各种区块链，同时EVM 擅长执行复杂且定制的智能合约，这对于包括 dApp、 DeFi平台、游戏和NFT在内的各种应用程序至关重要。同时，EVM也是目前最大的区块链生态系统，背后有一个巨大的开发者社区提供支持，技术更加成熟，生态应用丰富。

但EVM也存在一些不足。例如，可扩展性较差，EVM 每秒只能处理有限数量的事务；较高的Gas费，由于EVM可扩展性不足gas费在网络拥堵的情况下会快速增加；智能合约的不可逆性，一旦部署，区块链上的智能合约就无法更改。

Starcoin采用的Move虚拟机。它在合约运行前会进行校验，这个验证器可以检查出各种类型错误。在合约调用过程中合约的状态的安全性主要要通过编程语言内部的安全性进行隔离，确保智能合约更安全的运行。

同时与EVM相比，Move语言的可组合性体现在模块上，模块本身被存储在全局存储中，所以在智能合约优化升级方面只需针对其组合的模块进行即可，加速合约的升级优化速度。

# 4.4 基础组件的可组合性

可组合性主要体现在模块化区块链上，即将整个系统分成若干专门的组件，每个组件都有自己明确的功能和职责。这样的设计允许各个组件针对特定任务进行优化，从而确保高效的执行。就像乐高积木一样，每个积木都有其特定的形状和功能，但可以组合在一起建立各种各样的模型。

https://preview.redd.it/rw2vscrzlu1e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bb06001abdf3a7189799fff3bb98bcdd93192ac

目前发链平台都具备模块化区块链的能力，将区块链分成了执行层、数据可用性层、结算层以及共识层，极大的提升了网络的可组合性。

在Rollups方案中，L2链通常只负责执行层，将共识、数据可用性和结算交给以太坊主网。相对来说有如下优势：

1. 提高链的性能，对以太坊来说即是实现以太坊的扩容；
2. 促进生态繁荣，各模块承担不同功能，又保证整体安全性；
3. 提高用户体验，如指降低费用、减少碎片化、降低使用难度等；
4. 降低构建 Rollup L2 链的成本，除了从 L1 共享安全性外，还可共享节点运营商、定序器等多种服务。

目前Optimism和Arbitrum均是采用的Rollup方案，它们通过提供软件开发框架，使得通过其平台发行的L2链可以共享安全性、通信层和开源技术。如OP Stack，Arbirtrum Nitro、Polygon CDK，Rollup 框架是模块化区块链发展的最重要的组件，它让以模块化方式来搭建 L2 的门槛大大降低。

但值得注意的是，L2链在模块化构建中，由于Rollup框架、数据可用性服务、定序器、跨链桥等都是由Raas服务商设计好的，所以在定制区块链的时候灵活性和可扩展性较差。

就如dYdX抛弃StarEx上创建的L2（dYdX v3），选择迁移到Cosmos生态并发布dYdX Chain（dYdX v4）。借助Cosmos SDK发布的这条链是一条独立的L1，它摆脱了L2的限制，以业务逻辑为核心，从底层基础设施重新构建高度定制，实现了「完全去中心化的链下订单簿和匹配引擎」，这让 dYdX 作为一个 DeFi 应用能够为用户提供更快、成本更低的衍生品交易服务。

在 Cosmos 的模块化设计中，它将共识、状态机、虚拟机分开，让链的开发者可以更方便地进行积木式组合。比如，作为开发者，你可以定制自己的共识机制、为状态机增加特定的逻辑与模块、选用不同的虚拟机。这也是dYdX选择Cosmos SDK进行构建的原因之一。

而以高度可定制化和可组合性为主要叙事的Starcoin，在模块化区块链构建方面同样表现突出，其开发框架StarStack提供了高度模块化、易组合、易二次开发的技术组件。借助StarStack，开发者可以搭建一条独立的L1，应用根据业务逻辑，从底层框架进行全新构建，并在共识机制、链组件、通信协议、虚拟机等方面可以灵活配置。

根据介绍，其开发框架StarStack具备：

1. 可扩展性：模块化架构将共识、执行和存储等核心功能分解，允许开发者根据需求独立扩展每个模块
2. 灵活性：StarStack 的模块化设计使其能够更灵活地适应技术的更新和变化。每个模块可以单独进行优化或升级，而不会影响整个网络的稳定性。
3. 提升安全性：通过分离不同的功能，降低了单点故障的风险。每个模块相对独立，意味着即使一个模块受到攻击，其他模块仍然能够正常运行，从而提高整个网络的安全性。
4. 兼容与互操作性：模块化设计使得StarStack开发的链 更容易与其他区块链网络进行互操作。例如，通过分离执行层和共识层，可以支持与其他区块链之间的跨链交互和资产转移，进一步提升其生态系统的互通性。
5. 优化交易速度和费用：模块化设计允许不同的执行层处理复杂度不同的交易，优化了交易的执行效率，进而减少了用户在网络上支付的交易费用。

# 4.5 链上治理

治理模块对一个去中心化项目来说至关重要，目前很多项目都是采用的第三方平台进行项目管理，如Snapshot。当然如Polkadot、Cosmos、Starcoin等也开发了自己的链上治理模块，可供开发者调用。

Polkadot SDK提供了一套基于代币的治理模型。新构建的平行链可以通过原生代币参与项目的决策过程。其中，治理机制被协议化为相互关联的功能组件，如国库、议会、公投等，这些组件可以随着协议的升级进行迭代。参与治理的各个主体通过各自的区块链账号与系统交互，进行质押、委托、提案、投票等治理操作。

其治理框架提供的流程为：

1. 提案：提案是对网络的改进、协议升级、参数调整或其他重要事项的正式提议，任何人都可以进行提案；
2. 投票：平行链原生代币持有者可以通过公投投票表达对提案的支持或反对，投票机制可以采用不同的形式，如简单多数、加权投票或代币质押投票等，这些可以定制；
3. 决策：决策过程会根据一定的规则来确定最终的决策结果。这些规则可以包括投票通过的比例、投票持续时间、最低投票数量等；
4. 执行延迟：所有公投都有执行延迟期，这个模块也可以修改相关参数；
5. 自动执行：一旦达到执行延迟期，相应的操作将在链上执行，包括参数的调整、协议的升级、资金的转移等。

为实现链上治理，Polkadot SDK将智能合约、投票合约、投票权重、治理模块和治理参数结合，实现了一套功能完备且可定制化的链上治理机制。这种机制赋予了代币持有者参与决策的权利，并通过智能合约的自动执行确保了治理的透明度和公正性。

Cosmos SDK在链上治理方面体现出了一些创新，在提案之前应用链会预先打包了一个治理系统，提案可以是基于代码或文本，并且创建提案的权限可以自定义，然后由验证者和委托人进行投票，并提交到区块链上，在那里内容可以被验证者执行。

关于链上治理，Cosmos SDK提供了4个限制性门槛，可有应用链开发者选择和修改相关参数：

1. 质押应用链代币：为了防止垃圾信息，创建提案时需在设置的时间内质押一定数量的原生代币，可以由提案人质押，也可以像社区寻求支持。若规定的时间内未质押足够数量的代币，那么质押的代币将可以选择是否被销毁；
2. 法定人数：进入投票阶段后，有赞成、反对、否决、弃权四个选项，其中否决意思为强烈反对，Cosmos SDK组件中可以定义至少需要满足多少比例的质押代币进行投票才算满足；
3. 否决：在投票期结束前，可以规定不能超过定义比例的否决票；
4. 通过门槛：可以定义赞成的票比例要达到多少才能通过。

可以看出，由Cosmos SDK提供的链上治理相对更政治化，虽然可以由开发者定制相关参数，但门槛较多，并不适用于大多数普通用户。

而Starcoin的StarStack在链上治理方面推陈出新，通过DAO形式的治理机制，促进由StarStack构建的区块链实现去中心化治理，建立更包容、透明和高效的治理模式。相对Polkadot和Cosmos，StarStack的提案流程更精简友好，决策和交易公开透明，所有社区成员都可以参与网络治理。

1. 提案流程：DAO形式的治理流程精简且用户友好。首先由发起人提出变更或新政策。随后，由网络用户参与投票，用他们的代币表达对每项提案的偏好，这里可以由开发者定义提案时间、投票权重、通过形式以及提案的执行方式等，给开发者更多的定制化空间；
2. 与众不同的实现方式：StarStack DAO采用了一种独特的方法，即由不同的合约模块控制不同类型的提案。这种模块化系统是 Move 静态函数调用分布的结果，要求所有代码调用在编译时预先确定；
3. 去中心化投票：StarStack DAO采用基于代币的投票系统，投票数量与持有的代币数量成正比，同时开发者还可以调整投票代币的权重，如1000个代币以下是1 : 1，1000\~5000代币是1 : 0.8，以此来削弱持币大户的影响力，促进项目的去中心化治理；
4. 提案生命周期： StarStack DAO提供了一个全面的提案生命周期，包括待决、激活、失败、同意、排队、可执行和已执行等阶段，这些环节的参数均可以由开发者进行修改或停用。

通过StarStack DAO治理模块可以做到：

* 安全透明：DAO的链上治理确保透明度和安全性，所有决策和交易记录透明且防篡改；
* 高效：直接治理模式简化决策过程，无需中间人，减少官僚延误；
* 社区赋权：每个代币持有者投票，增强社区凝聚力，让每个成员对网络未来发展方向发表意见；
* 去中心化：通过调整代币投票的权重，可以调动更多的普通用户参与项目治理，削减持币大户的影响力，实现项目的去中心化治理；
* 高度可定制化：从提案流程、实现形式、去中心化投票以及提案生命周期等模块进行全面高度的可定制化设计，满足开发者对项目治理各种想法，给开发者提供更多灵活操作的空间。

# 4.6 数据可用性层

数据可用性层（DA层）主要负责确保网络中的数据可被访问和验证，它通常包括数据的存储、传输和验证等功能，以保证区块链网络的透明度和信任。

目前最具有代表性的 DA 项目有 Celestia、Avail、EigenDA 等。Opitimism、Arbitrum等rollup发链平台是没有DA层的，而Polkadot、Cosmos、Starcoin、Avalanche等单体公链本身是作为DA层。

Celestia 采用模块化架构，将区块链分解为数据、共识和执行三个部分。执行层独立存在于各自的区块链上，允许针对特定用例进行优化和专业化。此外，在 Celestia 的模块化区块链中，可以实现数据可用性采样，使节点能够用很小的样本验证一个区块，并且低硬件配置的设备也能充当节点。具体实现：

* 分离共识和执行层：允许开发者只需专注于他们的应用逻辑和智能合约，而无需处理底层的共识机制
* 专用数据可用性层：提供一个专门的数据可用性层，确保所有数据在链上是可用和可验证的
* 轻量级客户端支持：允许轻节点通过数据可用性取样来验证数据的可用性，而无需下载和存储整个区块链的数据
* 共享安全性：新启动的区块链可以共享 Celestia 的安全性，利用其强大的共识和数据可用性服

EigenDA是一种建立在以太坊上的去中心化数据可用性服务，利用 EigenLayer 的再质押（Restaking）功能构建，并成为 EigenLayer 上首个主动验证服务（AVS）。主要为Layer2提供数据可用性服务，具体实现如下：

* 利用再质押功能：允许以太坊质押者将其质押的 ETH 委托给 EigenDA，从而为数据可用性服务提供担保。
* 数据发布和存储：Rollup 可以将其交易数据发布到 EigenDA，EigenDA 通过分布式存储和验证机制，确保这些数据是可用和可验证的。
* 节点验证：在 EigenDA 系统中，节点运营商负责执行数据验证任务，确保数据的完整性和可用性
* 增强安全性和吞吐量：随着 EigenDA 上的质押量增加以及参与的节点和协议的发展，系统的整体安全性和交易吞吐量都会进一步提升

Eigen DA 的节点是 EigenLayer 网络中再质押节点的子集，由200名运营商和数百万再质押的ETH作为保护，继承了部分以太坊的安全性。但也正是因为依赖以太坊主网上的 Eigen DA 合约，所以在费用消耗上要高于其他DA层，它目前的写入速度是15 MB/s。

Avail 通过其 “Avail DA、Avail Nexus 和 Avail Fusion” 的三位一体方法简化了 Rollup 体验。每个组件在这个方法中扮演着独特的角色，共同提升了 Rollup 的性能、易用性和互操作性。

* Avail DA：提供了一个专门的数据可用性层，确保所有发布的数据在链上是可用且可验证的，Rollup 依赖这一层来确保状态转移和证明生成所需的数据是可用的。
* Avail Nexus：旨在将数据可用性和执行层分离。通过这种分离，利用 Avail DA 作为信任根，开发者可以独立于数据层来构建 Rollup，专注于应用逻辑和状态转移，而无需担心底层的数据可用性问题。
* Avail Fusion： 提供跨链兼容性，支持与多个区块链平台的互操作。这种跨链能力使得开发者可以在不同区块链之间轻松迁移和部署他们的 Rollup，提升了 Rollup 的可移植性和应用范围。

作为发链平台的Polkadot、Cosmos、Avalanche等本身就承载DA的需求，没有单独分离出DA层，数据的存储、传输、验证都是在其主网上进行，这样就造成了一些问题：

* 性能低下，区块链的性能等效于单个节点的水平；
* 大量的网络活动会引起极高的 Gas Fee；
* 天量的数据会引起状态爆炸，导致节点硬件要求增高，尤其是磁盘空间需要永久记录，这又与去中心化这个大前提相悖；
* 公链的升级改进在这种框架下极为困难。

提别要提到是Starcoin，它将数据可用性层单独分离出来，拥有自己的数据可用性层Starcoin DA，负责其主网和新开发的L1区块链数据的存储、校验和确认。Starcoin DA数据的高效、低成本和安全性验证，主要通过如下方式实现：

* 增强的可扩展性：通过并行化技术和FlexiDAG结构，提供了更高的可扩展性，开发者可以构建高吞吐量的区块链，这些链在Starcoin DA上发布数据，享受其高效的数据可用性和共识服务，从而实现更高的交易吞吐量和更低的交易成本。
* 资源动态调用：StarStack开发框架中提供了支持资源动态调用的功能，这意味着网络的计算资源可以根据网络需求动态调整。随着网络负载的增加，节点的计算资源将可以不断在各个区块链之间切换，有效做到了供给与需求的合理调配，确保了网络的高效运行和资源的合理利用。
* 灵活的开发工具：StarStack提供了一系列开发工具、SDK 和详细的文档，帮助开发者快速上手并创建自己的独立区块链，这些工具和资源简化了开发过程，使启动和部署新链变得更加直观和便捷。

同时，所有数据保存在链上，确保数据的可用性和完整性：

* 节点验证：所有节点都可以访问并验证数据；
* 高安全性：由于所有数据都在区块链上，任何节点都可以验证数据的完整性和有效性
* 透明度高：所有数据公开可见，易于审计；
* 去中心化：所有节点都能访问完整的数据，确保系统的去中心化和安全性。

总结下来，目前使用最广泛的仍然是将以太坊作为DA层，而Celestia 、Eigen DA、Avail DA主要是面向rollup以太坊生态，Starcoin DA则可以支持更多独立公链的数据可用性。

如果开发的区块链是L2，或者是以太坊的侧链，在不考虑成本的情况下，选择以太坊无疑是最好的，因为它为数据结算和共识提供了足够的安全性，在考虑成本的情况下，那么Celestia、EigenDA会是不错的选择，它们都支持Arbitrum Orbit、OP Stack等开发框架。

但如果开发需求是一条独立的公链，并且对数据读写速度、网络费用以及安全性有要求，那么可以选择Starcoin作为数据可用性层。因为它的费用足够低，并且数据读写速度可以突破100 MB/s，这非常适用于如社交平台、媒体平台、DeFi、游戏等需要高频交互的项目。在部署上也是非常简单，只需要调用StarStack内数据可用性相关组件，就可以轻松配置到自己的区块链上，与Starcoin主网共享数据安全性。同时，StarStack还配置了共识层，基于StarStack DA层还可以共享Starcoin的网络安全性和去中心化。

# 5. 一键发链技术价值及意义

# 5.1 帮助项目快速上线

一键发链可以帮助区块链项目快速部署自己的区块链网络，节省时间和开发成本。对于想要迅速上线的初创公司或者需要测试其项目的开发团队，一键发链提供了便捷的解决方案，避免了传统复杂的链上配置和开发工作。

# 5.2 为应用突破瓶颈提供支持

目前大多数Web3应用都是用智能合约编写，受限于原生平台，如共识机制、网络性能、交易成本等，一键发链技术成熟后，很多已经成型的应用将可以搭建自己的应用链，实现技术升级和业务的拓展。

# 5.3 帮助企业Web3转型

很多传统互联网企业想要实现Web3转型，但受限于技术不足，开发一条区块链复杂度、工程量都太大。实现一键发链后，很多互联网企业都可以接入Web，如社交、电商、游戏、娱乐等行业。

# 6. 瓶颈和挑战

这里提到的瓶颈和挑战主要是面向未来Web3大规模应用展开的，因为就目前Web3应用和用户来看，现有的性能已经完全能够满足圈内用户的交互。但试想面对 \[Next Billion User\] 级别的应用，目前的公链仍不能从容应用。

# 6.1 安全性问题

在Web3大规模爆发的时候，一键发链的需求也会呈指数级增长，越来越多的应用链会上线，随之而来的就是安全性问题。处理好安全性问题是技术应用的前提，这里的安全包括共识层面的安全、智能合约安全、用户账户安全等，因为每一步都有可能导致项目直接黄掉，安全是一个重大的课题，需要开发者和用户共同的参与。

# 6.2 性能问题

从前面我们可以看出，除了Starcoin理论值达到10万级以外，其他发链平台的TPS都非常低，这对于如金融交易平台、社交、游戏等板块来说，显然是不够的。并且我们还看到Optimism和Arbitrum的交易费都超过0.1美元，设想如果我给群里人发一个10元的红包，结果发现手续费都要1元，那么这个功能肯定不会上线。

# 6.3 权限问题

未来的一键发链肯定是面向企业级用户的，企业会有各种类型的需求，特别是在权限管理方面。目前大部分的公链都是开源的，链上数据公开透明，任何人都可以查看。而如果是以社交应用链，那么对于用户的隐私保护、VIP会员、用户等级权限等方面的考虑将会更多，现有的区块链在这方面显然是不满足的。

# 6.4 政策合规问题

正如Avalanche提到的，发链方需要位于有政策支持的国家或地区，开发者需要通过KYC/AML，并且还需要持有相关经营许可证书。合规问题一直是行业发展绕不开的话题，包括之前的瑞波被举报像投资者提供未经注册的证券类产品（XRP），从而导致瑞波官司缠身，项目的发展也停滞不前。

如果新发布的这些协议未在相应国家或地区的金融监管机构注册或者未被认可，可能被视为非法提供金融服务。

# 7. 总结：一键发链的未来

通过对几大主流发链平台的综合比较，我们可以看到，一键发链正逐步走向便捷化、模块化、定制化，并且分流成两条主线路，其一是依赖以太坊生态的L2，另一个则是高度定制化和灵活性的独立L1方向。L2已经趋于饱和，横向发展空间有限，而开发独立L1区块链的需求日益旺盛，未来的增长空间较大。对于未来一键发链的方向，大致有如下几个推论：

* 应用市场对区块链的需求增长变大。目前大部分的去中心化应用，都是基于公链开发的智能合约，但由于受限于公链的可扩展性，应用的规模和市场增长遭遇瓶颈，从dYdX和Uniswap发布独立区块链可以就可以看出。所以，未来会有更多的应用迁移至独立的应用链上。
* 独立L1区块链增长空间较大。Rollup虽然作为以太坊的扩容方案，但共识和结算都受限于以太坊，再去开发更多的L2只会像之前的智能合约一样推高成本，造成网络拥堵，所以开发独立的L1才能真正解决网络拥堵问题。
* 更多传统产业将像Web3转型。随着一键发链技术的成熟，发链的资金和技术成本降低，更多的互联网产业将迁移至Web3这条新赛道，借助区块链技术、代币经济学，实现产业升级。如跨境电商，可以搭建自己的区块链进行订单的查询、物流追踪、商家信用评分等。
* 与AI结合实现一键发链的智能化。AI+Web3将拓展出一条全新的赛道，一键发链门槛将进一步降低，实现类似ChatGPT对话形式的发链设置。例如，可以通过对话，提出定制化需求，让AI帮你实现发链合约的部署和链上参数的设置，这样哪怕是非技术人员也可以轻松部署自己的区块链。"

Are we finally getting credit scores and 0 collateral loans?,defi,1gmmcb1,2024-11-08 11:19:46,15,0.86,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1gmmcb1/are_we_finally_getting_credit_scores_and_0/,betasw1tch,:percent: Lend & Borrow,"I wanted to share a new defi protocol I came across recently.

Zeru is building an omnichain credit infrastructure on top of protocols like EigenLayer and LayerZero. An EigenLayer AVS will power zScore, an onchain credit score for borrowers, and zScore will also be an OApp so that the data is transferable across chains.

What I feel really interesting about this is they’re doing their own defi strategies, along with tapping into existing ones. If someone gets a good enough zScore, they can start taking out zero collateral loans. With those zero collateral loans you could increase the amount of liquidity you deposit into Uniswap, Beefy, or whatever. If the yield is high enough, you could loop that and get into triple digit yields on a low IL risk pool.

They’re really active at events the past few months. They’ve had people at ETHMilan, Dubai Blockchain Week, and they have team members in Bangkok now for DevCon.

Right now they have a testnet running on Berachain bArtio and that taps into protocols like Kodiak, BEX, and some others. On twitter they said a Base testnet deployment is coming soon.

### Revisiting Ethics in Blockchain ⁣Development: Recent Developments ⁢at the Ethereum Foundation

In recent months, the blockchain community witnessed significant developments involving key figures from the ​Ethereum Foundation. This ⁣renowned organization plays a pivotal role in overseeing ⁣and facilitating the growth of Ethereum, which ranks as the predominant platform for smart contracts and holds its position as⁢ the ​second-largest cryptocurrency⁣ environment ‌next to Bitcoin.

Strategic Shifts at EigenLayer: A Discussion of Security ⁢BorrowingEigenLayer has rapidly gained attention as an innovative force within cryptocurrency circles. This budding project introduces a distinctive “restaking” concept that allows other crypto applications to leverage Ethereum’s robust security mechanisms. ‌As such⁤ platforms‌ look towards enhancing their foundational security without rebuilding from scratch, EigenLayer positions itself as a vital player in streamlining these processes.

Unfolding Controversies and⁤ Ethical‌ QuestionsA shift occurred when⁣ researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake stepped back from their advising roles at EigenLayer earlier this year. Initially appointed with significant remuneration through EIGEN tokens, both aimed to direct EigenLayer’s strategic trajectory closely. ‌However, concerns about potential conflicts of interest surfaced shortly after their roles began, challenging ⁣prevalent norms around transparency and accountability⁤ within ⁤the ecosystem.

The disquiet culminated with both ‌Feist’s and Drake’s resignations from their advisory⁤ capacities ⁢following increasing scrutiny from‍ various stakeholders within ⁢the Ethereum community—a controversy underpinning deeper ideological rifts regarding ethical standards ‍in tech governance.

Drake candidly⁣ expressed regret over his decision to accept an advisory role that potentially undermined his impartiality toward fundamental research benefiting all ​network users—acknowledging‌ missteps despite no ​vested tokens having ‌transitioned during his tenure.

Feist echoed similar sentiments on social media about perceived conflicts ⁤affecting community trust levels even though engagements had been conducted transparently under good‍ faith terms ⁤intended for optimal alignment between both entities involved.

Moreover, responding proactively to this ordeal meant reevaluating future decisions concerning direct participation or investments among existing initiatives designed by‍ or affiliated closely with core development teams supporting critical frameworks ‌akin to what drives Ethereum forward today.

Committing to Neutrality Moving AheadThe saga concluded with individuals like Drake firmly opting⁣ out of any future ⁢advisory posts across‌ technology landscapes—not just limited but expanding customary policies ⁣into personally withholding involvement⁤ unless fundamentally essential⁣ for⁤ collaborative escalations necessitated officially by protocol teams or related stakeholder concentrations ⁢themselves.
   
 This voluntary‌ step exemplifies‌ not merely compliance‌ but strives ​toward embodying principled‌ practices ensuring nonbiased commitments across ‌evolving digital asset ecosystems globally‍ recognized today by ever-increasing participatory interests eyeing sustainable innovations continuing ⁢well into foreseeable futures—presiding over speculative realms involved necessarily regulatory insights anticipated ahead accordingly.
   
 It is undeniable—the unfolding events have triggered ⁤pivotal dialogues emphasizing persistent needs standardizing ethical conduct demonstrating adaptability while setting‍ precedents imperative navigating complex intersections where ​technology meets normative implications perennially contested among charting pathways forward alike modern enterprises emerging contemporarily worldwide.

I was wondering if someone could ELI5 what restaking on the EigenLayer is? I currently run my own validator and the few ETH I have left over I have stuck into Lido for stETH. 

Ledger now promotes restaking with Kiln on the EigenLayer layer when loading Ledger Live. Ive read through the documentation and I guess I still dont quite understand. 

I do understand the concept of locking it up for other chains as security. But what I dont quite understand is does my stETH that I restake still gain while staked and then plus I get restaked points that is possibly an IOU for an airdrop down the road?

Thank you all!"

EigenLayer enhances the Ethereum network by introducing a ""restaking"" mechanism, allowing users to harness their staked ETH to provide additional security for other decentralized applications (DApps) and services within the EigenLayer ecosystem.

The restaking concept magnifies and extends Ethereum's native security to other applications without the need to establish new validator sets. This opens up a range of possibilities for application developers seeking robust security without significant overhead.

EIGEN, the ecosystem's native token, is pivotal in this extended security model, enabling participation in restaking and ensuring the efficient operation of various services on EigenLayer.

We’re excited to introduce[ Ethereum Restaking on Kraken](http://kraken.com/features/eth-restaking), powered by EigenLayer. Restaking is a revolutionary way to increase your staking rewards while helping to secure decentralized applications (dApps) with your staked ETH.

**What is Restaking?** Restaking is just like normal staking—your ETH helps secure and validate a network of dApps. However, the EigenLayer protocol takes your staked ETH and uses it to secure multiple additional protocols and dApps. This lets you earn higher rewards in the process through EigenLayer’s Actively Validated Services (AVSs).

**How to Get Started:**

* Have ETH staked or in your Kraken spot balance.
* Log in to your verified Kraken Pro account.
* Start restaking your ETH with just a few clicks.

**Why Restake?**

* Earn extra rewards on top of your standard ETH staking.
* Help secure dApps built on Ethereum.
* Easy to set up via Kraken’s platform.

**Who is Eligible?**

* Verified Kraken Pro account holders (Intermediate level or above).
* Holders of ETH in either a spot or staked balance.
* Residents of unrestricted geos 

Kraken has a long-standing relationship with Ethereum, being the first exchange to list ETH back in 2015. Now, we’re proud to bring you this innovative restaking opportunity, continuing our legacy of supporting the future of decentralized finance.

#Jupiter Aidrop

It's not my thing to talk about airdrops but i'll give it a try with Jupiter. If you staked Jupiter and joined in on the governance votes, good news - you’ll be scoring some rewards. They announced that the airdrop will kick off on Monday, so keep an eye out to grab your tokens. And that's not all. Along with your Jupiter tokens, you'll also snag Sanctum, Cloud tokens and Bridge tokens, which means even more rewards. The whole point of these airdrops is to give back to those who are active in the community (like ours XD), showing that in a lot of crypto projects, the more you engage, the more you earn. 

#Mr.Beast (yikes)

Mr. Beast got accused of messing with the crypto market, and guess what? It’s that classic pump-and-dump scheme. Here’s how he did it: he bought up some low-cap tokens (no donuts was not one of them) and then hyped them up to his massive following. We’re talking 320 million subscribers. So, when the price shot up from all that hype, he sold everything and made millions, while the token prices tanked. For the Super Token alone, he raked in about $9 million, and it didn’t stop there; he also made around $1.7 million with Pemon, $765,000 with ShopX, and hundreds of thousands more with other tokens. The result? Prices of these tokens dropped between 70% and 90%. This should be a big wake-up call for anyone following influencers and hoping to cash in on their recommendations. They are not your friends or care aobut you.

#Trump - World Liberty Rugpull?

Speaking of big names in the crypto scene, this Tuesday, October 15th, the World Liberty Finance project (WLF), backed by the Trump family, had a pretty big token launch. They raised an insane $220 million in just a few minuteslol. This DeFi project is running on the Ethereum network and is teamed up with the AAVE. WLF aims to offer services like loans and staking digital assets. They also plan to raise a total of $300 million by selling 20% of the tokens to qualified investors. The goal is to attract both big financial institutions and smaller investors. The launch happened super close to the U.S. election campaign, which has raised some eyebrows about the Trump family's connection to the crypto market. 

#Italy - We want your GAINZ

In a surprising move, the Italian government announced a significant increase in the capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies, raising it from 26% to an eye-popping 42%. This adjustment is included in their 2025 budget, aiming to use the additional funds to support programs for young families and businesses. Additionally, if your crypto profits exceed €2,000, you will be required to report those earnings on a designated form. This tax increase is part of a broader trend observed in several European nations, where governments are attempting to regulate the crypto industry while also increasing their revenue. F*** them.

#Hail Kraken

Kraken has introduced a new feature that could simplify things for its users. They’ve launched a restaking service in collaboration with the EigenLayer protocol. Essentially, if you’ve already staked ETH on Kraken, you can now restake those assets, allowing you to earn additional rewards without needing to withdraw your ETH. The benefit is that this process enhances the security and resilience of multiple networks, as your assets will help safeguard other protocols. This is a significant improvement for those looking to maximize their assets in ETH network. The downside is that this new feature is currently only accessible to users outside Burgerland due to existing regulations.

#Another day, another Hack

The Radiant Capital protocol, which focuses on decentralized lending, just got hit by a hack and the attackers made off with about $58 million from their networks on BNB and Arbitrum. Because of this, Radiant Capital had to pause all operations on both the Base network and Mainnet while they looked into the attack with the help of security firms. It seems the breach happened due to compromised private keys and poor contract management which shows just how crucial it is to ensure security in DeFi protocols. They've now told all users to revoke any permissions they granted to contracts to prevent further losses.
