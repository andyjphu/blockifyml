Dear Diary 

I’m feeling quite lonely today, as Kody is in Huntsville, L-abama. I told him he should go and see Madison to try to patch things up, so that I can film with more of my grandkids to rehabilitate my image. Sadly though, he ended up in Madison County instead because he forgets he’s got daughters with Janelle. It’s all very embarrassing to me to say the least, and if he’s there overnight he knows he’s got to buy me a new precious moments figurine to make up for it. I hear my personal cellular phone ringing and see it’s Kody so I pick up straightaway. 

“Hey Raaaabyn, how’s it going?"" I am about to reply when Kody cuts me off, saying ""Raahbs, listen up a minute, yeah, just keep your loyal mouth shut and don't nag me. I've decided I’m going to do you a favour today and just let you deal with all the children, mmkay. And I don’t owe you this favour, right - I don't owe any wives any favours - but it’s my gift to you because you are shy and pretty and loyal. So don’t let yourself or them do anything that would make me resent them or make me not want to love all of you. Laters.”

Before I can reply, he’s hung up. I put my personal cellular phone down and frown a bit. I'm not really sure why it's called that, I mean it doesn't have any cellulite, just like me, but even if I had, Kody would totally love me because he loved my sister wives even though they had stretch marks and had to walk sideways like a crab through any turnstiles. I sigh deeply. Well shucks, Robyn, looks like it’s just you and the kiddos today, maybe we should go out for a fun family lunch and perhaps a bit of shopping now that the coast is clear. 

I head downstairs and make my way over to Aurora and Breanna who are giggling, sitting down by the fireplace. I overhear Breanna joking about making a break for freedom by wriggling up the chimney. I put on my best frowny face and clear my throat and remind them about loyalty to their celestial spirtual father, Kody, and also about the Rumour Mill. Their smiles are gone and their faces turned white. I ask them what they’re doing. They say they’re playing monopoly and would I like to join. 

Well sure I would! This game involves buying property, which is one of my only skills. I roll the dice, and Aurora tells me I have to pick up a card . Oh no, I think, it says “go straight to jail”! I frown about it - I'm too shy and pretty for jail - so I bow my head and join together my hands and I pray out loud to Heavenly Father. I ask him to protect me from jail and also to find me a 7 bedroom rental, so that we don’t have to steal Janelle’s 401K to buy yet another mansion. I hear the angels singing. They tell me that I’m free, and that I can move to Boardwalk and get it for free. I smile. This is the America I learned about in school! 

15 minutes later I own every property on the board so I suggest that we should go and celebrate that by having a spot of lunch somewhere. I try to remember which restaurants we are still welcome at in Flagstaff. I frown. We certainly can’t go back to Salsa Brava - we were unfairly banned from there just because Kody ordered a 8 lemon waters and sugar and made us lots of free lemonade, also because we made spiritual congress in the disabled toilets. I also can’t risk Josephine’s because Savannah may be waitressing today and she’s not allowed to talk to my tender children because her mother is not a good sister wife. Looks like it’s going to be Fat Olives. 

I load my children in the back of the car, drive off, and get a few traffic tickets from playing on my phone while driving to Fat Olives. I park up and desperately try to recall what it is I can actually feed on, other than money. I guess I will just stick to a salad of some sort, at least that’s also green… 

I sure hope tomorrow is better! "

Kiwi Ears Nailed It At Their First Try! The Kiwi Ears Division,headphones,1i9wah4,2025-01-25 15:32:54,0,0.4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1i9wah4/kiwi_ears_nailed_it_at_their_first_try_the_kiwi/,GreenUserper,Review,"# Review Of The Kiwi Ears Division



https://preview.redd.it/e64zf4dq87fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=871cb28e1bed6fa79adc4fadaf409fa097c5b470



**Introduction**



https://preview.redd.it/784f276397fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb4fa57db3191a0995916ed2bb2187341612124

I’ve been eagerly waiting for the arrival of headphones from various companies, but I never imagined Kiwi Ears would enter this market so swiftly. Kiwi Ears is a well-known Chinese electroacoustic company that has been producing audiophile-favorite in-ear monitors, affordable DAC/AMPs, and now headphones. The company has been engaged in extensive research and development of their products, particularly their IEMs, and has released them without any breaks. Surprisingly, they have garnered a massive following among audiophiles, and I’m one of them. Regardless of their previous offerings, Kiwi Ears’ entry into the headphone market is on a whole new level. Many companies have attempted and failed in their initial attempts to create headphones, and I fear the same for Kiwi Ears with their Division release. Fortunately, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one to determine whether it’s a hit or a miss. However, before delving further, I’d like to clarify a few points. 



**Disclaimer**



\*Since this unit tour was organised by the kindly people at Kiwi Ears, I am grateful to them. As I've said in all of my evaluations, the same is true for this one: all of the concepts I've expressed below are entirely my own, original ideas that haven't been influenced by anyone else. If interested, go to this [link](https://kiwiears.com/products/kiwi-ears-division). 

\*I am not associated with the connection, and I receive no financial assistance from anyone.

\*For the remainder of the review, I will refer to these headphones as “Division.”

\*I am using different ear-tips for convenience and better versatility.

\*Finally, I will only evaluate the Division based on its performance, even though I will explain how it feels and seems physically and aesthetically.

\*Please understand that all opinions expressed in this review are my personal perspective and are not intended to offend anyone’s beliefs or experiences. Therefore, I kindly request a respectful and thoughtful approach to this review, even if it differs from your viewpoint.

\*Apologies for the delayed review of these headphones. I eagerly awaited another excellent contender in this price range, the Takstar Pro 82, to arrive. Unfortunately, due to some complexities and workarounds, they never cleared customs in my country. 



**Specifications**



https://preview.redd.it/pfe0cxv497fe1.png?width=3910&format=png&auto=webp&s=6db199abe905bad5067f842734fc7eefb2944fa1

The Division headphones feature a closed-back design with a 40mm composite dynamic driver in each earcup. The plastic headband swivels to one side and folds inwards, making them convenient for storage. The earpads are generic and come with the headphones, similar to those found on budget-friendly headphones. The headband ends are marked with “L” and “R,” and the body of the earcups on the outside bear the Kiwi Ears logo on both sides. Accessories include a 1/4 inch adapter with two cables. Each cable has a single-ended 3.5mm jack, one for the headphones and the other for the source. One cable is long and extendable, while the other has a built-in microphone with a single button. Technically, the headphones have an impedance of 32 ohms and a sensitivity of 98dB. Their frequency response range spans from 20Hz to 20kHz. 



**Design & Build**



https://preview.redd.it/xv1bs9u597fe1.png?width=3783&format=png&auto=webp&s=90f924cc35965d9ed27368c5ce91defbdc4d92a5

Now, let’s talk about the design. It’s quite similar to the Audio Technica M50x, but it’s not as sturdy. I believe the Divisions have a good build and can last long, but I’m not sure what to expect from a $50 headphone. The plastic quality is generic, and durability isn’t its strong suit, but it proved me wrong, I believe.



As for the earpads, they’re also generic, but they’re cheap and can cover average-sized ears easily.



During my commutes and some rough handling while taking and keeping them in my backpack, I’m not confident, but I do think that these headphones are built well for the price. However, this is just my personal experience, and I still feel like they could break if I’m not careful.



The cables are similar to those that come with Bluetooth speakers, but they’re better made and molded specifically for headphones. The mic on the shorter cable is similar to the Koss KPH30i and works great too.



Overall, I find the design to be very casual and easy to use. The lightweight body makes them convenient and easy to handle, even though they look a bit flimsy. In my testing, they turned out to be sturdy. 



**Usage**



https://preview.redd.it/t69mxnz697fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2621eabfe05032e5a789a744d32653a18c6c470a

Now, since I mentioned earlier that I used this headphone while commuting, I’d like to share that I also used them at home for critical listening. Honestly, I didn’t expect comfort from the earpads, and they weren’t very comfortable. On the other hand, the pressure on my head from the cups was perfect, and I was able to tolerate the pads for longer hours.



I must admit that I was a bit careless when using this outside. I would take them out of my backpack, put them inside, or rest them on my shoulder while the cable got tangled and stretched out. But I was amazed by how durable this headphone was.



Regarding using this with different sources, I genuinely never felt underpowered with any source, whether it was my LG G8X or my FiiO M15S. However, when I plugged them into my Aune X7S, a desktop Class-A amplifier, the drivers distorted while listening to music. The bass sounded bloated and too boomy, which I believe is a result of either overamplification or an incompatible source.



I should mention that these headphones have powerful bass that I personally didn’t find bleed into the mids. However, I spoke to people who own Division and complained that the bass is too boomy and overpowering. So, I tried different earpads, especially deep ones, and found that the bass was significantly improved and less prominent. This helped the midrange to sound a bit tamed and balanced the treble.



The passive noise cancellation was truly great. It effectively isolated me from the crowd and allowed me to focus on the music. However, it’s important to note that Division aren’t like noise-canceling headphones. The effectiveness of the noise cancellation depends on how well they seal around the head, and I believe they are effective for average-sized ears.



Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed using these headphones and encountered no issues. The only drawbacks were the discomfort of the earpads and the amplifier issue. I understand that readers may be concerned about sweat and warmth buildup inside the earcups, but since it’s winter, I can’t provide much information. I’m not sure how they’ll perform in the summer. However, I believe these earpads are ideal for keeping the ears warm. 



**Sound**



https://preview.redd.it/exxw677897fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a816126a0243ec4543524e83188805db6d9a391

After thoroughly evaluating this headphones from various perspectives and criteria, I must say that I believe they are indeed DJ headphones and, to an extent, a great basshead audiophile headphone. They offer an enjoyable and exciting listening experience, especially considering their affordable price point of $50. However, I am slightly skeptical about their suitability for mixing.



I have primarily observed mixing professionals using specifically open-back headphones. Nevertheless, I believe this headphones could work well for mixing, considering their tuning. Although I am not a technical expert, I feel confident in my assessment.



Now, let’s talk about the sound. They do sound like an In-Ear Monitor (IEM) that covers the ear, but more specifically, a basshead IEM, which is why I mentioned Division as a basshead headphone. The tuning is quite easy to understand. The bass region features a bass shelf that gradually descends and flattens out before 300Hz, resulting in less bloated and boomy bass. However, they provide excellent body to the overall presentation and give the mids a warm quality. The upper midrange and lower treble are well-forwarded to compensate for the impactful bass, which it achieves effortlessly and cleanly.



Another reason why I consider this headphones good is that Kiwi Ears designed them without any unique or proprietary technology. They simply took the body of a headphone, two drivers, and a bit of dampening. Of course, I haven’t opened this headphones to inspect the internals, but honestly, it doesn’t matter for such an affordable pair.



Now, let’s delve deeper into the critical evaluation of this headphones before reaching a verdict. 



**Bass** 



On the graph, this headphone showed a really well-emphasized frequency range from 30Hz to 250Hz, which is great on paper. However, while listening, the bass tends to sound thumping and booming, which can sometimes become a bit bloated. This was the result of pairing this headphones with a Class A amplifier.



When I listened to this headphones with low gain or any other device with a headphone jack, the response sounded well-controlled, bodied, and dynamic. Of course, I have other headphones that are much better in terms of bass delivery, offering better impact, resolution, and dynamics. However, I found this headphones to be really well-done for the price.



The drums, kicks, toms, and bass slams sound full-bodied and hit hard without overemphasizing or sounding booming over the overall presentation. Listening to tracks from Skrillex, such as “Taka,” “Rumble,” and “Xena,” the drops were deep, impactful, and hard-hitting, well-controlled and composed.



While listening to metal tracks like “Skin & Bones” by Silverstein and “Thy Art Is Murder” by Keres, the drums, toms, and bass slams sounded meaty and weighty. However, busy sections of this tracks made it difficult to hear the upper frequencies. 



**Mid Range**



Now, I’m particularly impressed with these headphones because, on their first attempt, Kiwi Ears managed to achieve a closed-back design that delivers great sound quality, particularly in the midrange. The response has a good emphasis in the midrange that allows forwardness and liveliness to blend well, making the vocals the center stage while the instruments complement them. The notes didn’t have any sharpness or peakiness, resulting in a soft sound. 



The female vocals have a nice body and lack weight, which gives them a pleasant tonality and cleanliness. In contrast, the male vocals have good girth. The instruments, whether percussion, strings, or others, sound wholesome and well-presented in the mix, but the contrast between them was lacking. Overall, the response is forward, energetic, and lively.



For example, listening to tracks like “Labyrinth” by Hockrockb, the vocals sounded forward and clean, with a good body and spread-out sound. However, there were a few “ss” sounds that became noticeable. Regarding the instruments, they sounded rich and well-presented, blending seamlessly with the vocals.



Another track, “The Feels” by Labrinth, sounded well-flourished. The vocals, whether female or male, were well-presented. The male vocals had the right weight and tone, while the female vocals were too dense to sound airy and expressive.



**Treble** 



Another fantastic aspect of these headphones is their treble region. It’s exceptionally well-extended, sounding complete and full without any sibilance or harshness in the upper or lower frequencies. This is achieved thanks to the emphasis in the 100-200Hz range, which creates a warm and balanced sound.



The overall presentation of the notes is warm and rich, rather than lean and crisp. The treble is well-extended and has a good sense of space and air for a closed-back headphone. The energy is well-controlled, which helps to maintain a tonally favorable sound. The lower treble also resonates well with the upper midrange, as the vocals and instruments have a forwardness and cleanliness that is both lively and lean.



Tracks like “Overfly” by Luna Haruna sounded exceptionally extended, with the vocals sounding fuller and more open, and the instruments like cymbals and percussion having clear and well-defined notes. 



**Technical Specifications**



Well, to be honest, I don’t find much out of the ordinary when it comes to speaking about technical aspects of the Division. Most closed-back headphones don’t sound great for technical prowess, whether it’s the staging, resolution, or separation. The same can be said for other closed-back headphones I’ve compared them to.



When it comes to staging, imaging, and separation, I don’t have much to say except that the imaging is clean but not precise. The staging is wide enough to sound spacious for a closed-back headphone, but the separation between the notes is not very distinctive.



Now, the resolution is quite good. The macro details are well-surfaced, while the micro details suffer. The attack and decay of the notes are quick-paced, which is enough to prevent the sound from sounding muddy or messy.  



**Impressions & Comparisons** 



**Sources**

**Sony WM1A -** While listening to Division with WM1A, the response sounded more balanced and mature, with better control across the entire frequency spectrum. The bass was a bit loose but warm, less punchy yet thick, especially compared to other pairings. The midrange was airy and open, particularly the female vocals, and even the instruments sounded vibrant and lively with excellent distinction. In terms of the treble, the response was refined in my opinion. It was as extended as before but smoother and better in revealing the notes.



https://preview.redd.it/palwsubc97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9fc41e289fe7dfc23cf5dd32406ee5bab6ac1e1

**FiiO M15S -** While listening to Division with M15S, the response was energetic across the entire frequency spectrum, allowing for a wider range of expressions and greater impact. The bass was punchier and more controlled, while the midrange had a forwarded but slightly clustered response. The treble region was well-emphasized, resulting in a clearer and shimmering sound. 



**Comparisons**



**AKG K361 and Division**



https://preview.redd.it/grg1wvgd97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92dd07ab85eab5f46c6231bc4861ba8bea70e67

To be honest, conducting an A&B test revealed that the K361 sounded more artificial than the Division. The reason behind this is that the Division offered a more immersive and prominent bass presence during listening. Additionally, the vocals and instruments in the Division were better expressed and tonally rich. However, when it comes to the overall presentation, the K361 excels. It surpasses the Division in terms of its comprehensive presentation, revealing more details and achieving a better balance and note revelation. Despite its higher price point, I had expected the K361 to deliver overall better sound. 



**Division and Sony MDR7506** 



https://preview.redd.it/ns8wzt9e97fe1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=f939cc91722df2cb37729083972bac9b84463b62

Well, in my opinion, the revealing set and perhaps a bit too much is the 7506. It offers better contrast and clarity. However, it’s worth noting that the lean factor across the presentation makes the Division a favorable choice. As the notes have a better body and weight, they sound warm, rich, and more balanced in terms of dynamics and forwardness. Now that I know K361 is as expensive as the 7506, I believe the 7506 has a more airy and revealing sound compared to the K361, while the Division has a richer and more dynamic sound than the 7506.

Division is undoubtedly one of the best choices within the $50 price segment, which is why I believe Kiwi Ears offered this at the most affordable price possible. Considering the convenience and sound quality, it makes perfect sense for someone with a budget of $50-60 to spend on a fun and engaging headphone. While I understand that bassheads will likely appreciate this, I can’t comment on their suitability for mixing professionals since I haven’t had the opportunity to try other professional-grade headphones in this price range. I was particularly excited to compare this to the Takstar Pro 82. However, I must reiterate that I love these headphones just as much as I love my AKG K361 and Sony MDR 7506. These casual wear headphones are suitable for basic consumers because they tend to sound very favorable towards the general population, similar to any Harman-tuned product. Therefore, I can confidently recommend these headphones based on their price, performance, and convenience. However, I wish they had a bit more comfortable earpads. "

Composer vs Chat Discussion,cursor,1i9ve6x,2025-01-25 14:53:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1i9ve6x/composer_vs_chat_discussion/,justmud,,"As this tool is evolving super quickly, I thought I'd add some context here after spending a couple of weeks of heavy usage. By heavy usage, I mean attempting to build out an n-tiered application on AWS that involves a VPC, multi-az, API Gateway, multiple lambda functions, step functions, SQS queues and SNS topics, elasticsearch, Route53, all the logging and monitoring you'd expect, IAM users, roles, policies, etc....all tied together. All created via Terraform. Lambdas in python. Addtionally, a super simplistic UI in nextjs connected to a C# API. 

Zero lines of code written by me so far, on purpose. So, really beating up the agent. The most I've done is point it to Stackoverflow posts when it gets stuck and starts looping through the same attempted solutions (which it will do without guidance, so beware).

Basically, I treat it like an incredibly talented, adaptable junior dev with a faultless memory who never needs a pizza or a Redbull and never complains.

I did 100% of this work by talking to the Composer. Well... 99.999999%. I recently discovered that CMD+K is nice for quick inline fixes for one or two lines of code in one file. And today, needing to get serious about security considerations before I racked up a truckload of tech debt, decide to start transitioning to a VPC. Hence the higher level conversation that did not need to immediately result in code changes.   
  
Anyway...here's the conversation I just had with the Chat agent because I was similarly confused. 

So here's the conversation. I found it illuminating...and shamelessly self-congratulatory in the last sentence. Not that I disagree. ;P

  
  
**When i talk to you via the Chat feature you do not automatically start creating files or modifying existing ones. That's good for general discussions. How do I make the transition from architectural discussion in Cursor Chat to implementation in the Cursor Composer?** 

  
The transition from Chat (architectural discussions) to Composer (implementation) is typically done by:For example, if you wanted to start implementing the VPC infrastructure we just discussed, you could:The key difference is that Composer works in the context of specific files, while Chat is better for broader discussions and planning.Would you like to start implementing any specific part of the architecture we discussed?

**Ok cool. And when we discuss complicated topics here that generate a lot of output, is there a consistent way to tag parts of the discussion to make it easy for the composer to reference?**

Yes! There are several effective ways to tag or reference parts of our Chat discussions for Composer:

    [ARCH-1] VPC Architecture
    [ARCH-2] Security Groups
    [ARCH-3] Data Flow

* Use specific reference tags for code examples:

&#8203;

    #CODE_REF: vpc_setup
    resource ""aws_vpc"" ""main"" {
      // ...
    }

* Use descriptive labels for decision points:

&#8203;

    #DECISION: vpc_endpoints
    - Decided to use VPC Endpoints for AWS services
    - Rationale: Keep traffic private, improve security

Then in Composer, you can reference these markers:""Please implement the VPC configuration we discussed in \[ARCH-1\] and the security groups from #CODE\_REF: vpc\_setup""Would you like to try this tagging approach with our previous architectural discussion?

**sure**

Let me reorganize our previous discussion with clear tags:\[ARCH-1\] High-Level Architecture

\[ARCH-1\] High-Level Architecture

    External -> API Gateway -> VPC -> Private Services
    Primary Use Case: Webhook Document Ingestion

\[ARCH-2\] Network Layout

    VPC Structure:
    ├── Public Subnets
    │   └── NAT Gateway
    └── Private Subnets
        ├── Lambda Functions
        ├── Aurora
        ├── OpenSearch
        └── VPC Endpoints
    

\[SEC-1\] Security Components

    - API Gateway: Entry point security
    - VPC Endpoints: Private AWS service access
    - Security Groups: Service-to-service access control
    - Private Subnets: Isolated compute resources

\[FLOW-1\] Data Flow Pattern

    Webhook -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> {DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Aurora, S3}

\[CODE-1\] Example Security Group Pattern

    resource ""aws_security_group"" ""lambda"" {
      name        = ""lambda-sg""
      vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
    
      ingress {
        from_port       = 443
        to_port         = 443
        protocol        = ""tcp""
        prefix_list_ids = [aws_vpc_endpoint.execute_api.prefix_list_id]
      }
    }

Now you can open a Terraform file in Composer and reference these sections specifically, like ""Help me implement the network layout from \[ARCH-2\]"" or ""Let's implement the security group pattern from \[CODE-1\]"".Would you like to start implementing any of these components?

**No need, as I already started implementing. I just wasn't sure if Chat and Composer shared session context.** 

Ah, I understand your question now. No, Chat and Composer don't directly share session context - they operate as separate systems. However, you can explicitly reference our Chat discussions in Composer by:This separation can actually be beneficial because:Would you like me to explain any other aspects of how Chat and Composer interact (or don't interact)?

**Well, you say that context is not directly shared, but it sounds like via tag reference Composer can access the output from Chat that is available here client-side. So the context is not shared in sessions in the cloud behind the GPT, but can be shared client-side to smooth the use of the toolchain**

Exactly right! You've made an important distinction:This is similar to how developers might:The tagging system essentially creates a local ""documentation bridge"" between the architectural discussions in Chat and the implementation work in Composer. Pretty clever design by the Cursor team!"

Welcome to the third part of our devblog series about the Children of Tarra Update. This time, we’re diving into Palium, the fifth planet in Gatekeeper.

https://preview.redd.it/codbj91ey6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=166e5c995c09d420e5e9c6ee6787c68a01b23091

Palium is a harsh, rocky world where basalt fields stretch endlessly to the horizon. On its frozen side, the massive Elden Tree towers high enough to be visible from space.

Once, Palium was home to the Carrons, explorers who sought to uncover the planet’s secrets. However, their research ended in catastrophe with the awakening of the ancient Siren—Tarra.

Tarra decimated nearly all life on the planet before creating her own beings to inhabit these desolate lands. Now, Palium is more than just a realm of ruins—it’s a deadly arena where survival hinges on the whims of a destructive force.

# Who You’ll Face

Palium is home to a variety of creatures, each presenting unique challenges. Here’s a brief look at some of them:

 • **Emberling**

https://preview.redd.it/xnzrg0poy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=610229629413883844e357dad2a132f5e3b77bba

Friendly in nature, these creatures redirect lava flows beneath the planet’s surface. They tend to avoid Gatekeepers but leave explosive traps in their path.

 • **Cave Creeper**

https://preview.redd.it/hh8ouw3qy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=301233e1d922018360cfd4bbbe50e762edadbf7c

Ancient inhabitants of Palium, these creatures burrow underground and attack with toxic saliva from a distance or their claws in melee combat.

 • **Mourn**

https://preview.redd.it/jrxv4qwqy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbb1583a9edb4478f8bb78dafc73f5a7adb63b85

Ghosts of Carrons tormented by Tarra, they hide within the veins of the Elden Tree and often attack from afar with fiery projectiles.

 • **Caldeon**

https://preview.redd.it/p8dvybxry6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7893c0a0588c9dab5e274fd66ff02b33e6ee773c

One of Palium’s primary guardians. It fights in close quarters, scattering magma clusters and leaving burning pools in its wake.

 • **Ashling**

https://preview.redd.it/q6gh8vysy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae77adc2b737c23921064683eb2c674ada8515ac

A mysterious entity that teleports to its target, dealing area damage. It also burrows into the ground, scorching everything around it with a devastating beam.

 • **Hulk**

https://preview.redd.it/7ex8ejdvy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=54e870428cdfdbb544adf49d2800f718267ab749

A massive stone juggernaut that destroys everything in its path. It attacks with enormous pincers, devastating large areas.

• **Gnash**

https://preview.redd.it/kehd19kwy6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdae56036c1534b96bd1196fdd6a5738383a9d9f

The result of Carron experiments with Palium’s resources. It spits acid and strikes with its short but incredibly powerful limbs.

 • **Inferna**

https://preview.redd.it/g2m35n50z6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbce68b507d1df5c157339930856a584262b29d

A Rampant from the Ethel dynasty, exiled from Aurora for her differences. Inferna is a highly dangerous opponent with a wide array of skills.

 • **Child of Palium**

https://preview.redd.it/dx2eskb1z6fe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=31a3f373af585dec170b1073c6db04e366de824f

Familiar from the Arena, this cocoon contains a potential child of Tarra. It defends itself—and its mother—with electrical discharges.

 • **Tarra**

https://preview.redd.it/ofe6bo32z6fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e42cda01de07d44c130eb718b7f3a9ef72fd26

The Siren of Palium. We’ve reworked her abilities, adding new elements. What’s changed? You’ll have to find out in the battle!

Palium introduces new interactive objects to diversify your runs and keep you on your toes. We hope you enjoy every detail of this new planet! 

That’s all for now. In the fourth and final part of our devblog series, we’ll cover smaller additions and share our plans for the future. See you on Palium!

PC randomly restarting,pchelp,1i9v5al,2025-01-25 14:42:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1i9v5al/pc_randomly_restarting/,Normal-Dark-574,OPEN,"Since 1/12/25 my PC (Alienware Aurora R10 purchased in 2021 or 2022) has randomly restarted many times (5 times today alone). Mostly in times of next to no load. (IE surfing web or just sitting idle). The symptom is an instant restart bringing me back to the login screen within a few seconds. 

Frequency has increased from once per day for the first several days to every 10-20 minutes it seems now.

I've performed FurMark2 for 30+ min and no issues came up. GPU  (NVIDIA RTX 3080) got to 80C with a hotspot of 90C. (this was performed at the beginning of the issues popping up)

I've performed Memtest86 and it went through 4 tests with no issues. (this was performed at the beginning of the issues popping up). Mind you PC was on over night and did not crash.

Thinking it may be PSU, I removed everything and did a deep clean on it. Went to store to pick up a new PSU to find out that since I have an Alienware PC, you can't just pick up a random PSU, and it's a Dell Proprietary PSU. Reinstalled the PSU and the PC worked for about 2 consecutive hours.

Woke up this AM and it worked for another hour or two while gaming then randomly shut off again after I quit my game and started working on FreeCAD again.

Thinking it had something to do with a Windows 10 update, I updated to Windows 11.

Issues still persist.

Downloaded MalwareBytes and it's reporting no viruses. 

I do not remember downloading anything new at that time.  My PC has never been overclocked. 

I mostly use the PC to game or create 3D models for 3D printing. First time issue occurred I was using FreeCAD. 

My event viewer is blowing up relative to an identical PC bought at same time. Attached Event Viewer codes if anyone can help decipher them.  I did a quick scan of when shut downs occurred vs what the logs said and I did not find any quick correlation. 

I am currently running FurMark in the background to see if it will shutdown while under full load or not. 

Any help is greatly appreciated! TIA!"

Dealership GM threatened me on the phone,Seattle,1i9u737,2025-01-25 14:01:15,0,0.45,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1i9u737/dealership_gm_threatened_me_on_the_phone/,waste_of_sperm_69,Rant:deadstare:,"First time car buyer, a friend and I recently moved to Seattle. I booked a test drive for a $70k car and wanted to check out a few other cars, v excited and both of us had been test driving a lot of cars in the last few weeks. When I visited, the sales rep showed me the car but the GM standing next to me wouldn't let me rev the engine at all to listen to the exhaust note. Still understandable because it was cold outside and inside the engine bay. Next he requested my Licence and the insurance policy number, I gave him my licence but didn't have auto-insurance since I don't own a car. I tried requesting them and told him about WA law where the dealership is required to ensure their own vehicles which is also supposed to cover test drives and it is also liable for medical expenses of the driver in any accidental cases. The guy would not work with me at all, and he did not offer me any alternate options, he stopped even talking to me. I had to walk out of the store and felt mistreated to add to the story. I had brought a friend along who was also interested in a $60K car and he also had to walk out with me because he was in the same boat. 

At the end of the day, it’s a private business and they can refuse service to anyone, so I did not take it personally, I just put up a one star review on Google maps and just wrote a one liner that I was denied a test drive, wasn’t offered any alternate options. Feels like I wasted my valuable time. I would not bring my business here, which is my personal opinion, which I’m allowed to share.  The GM call me in 30 minutes and is very mad on the phone as to why I am threatening his business all because of a corporate policy, we had some back-and-forth and explain how the sales rep didn’t even offer me the option to sit as a passenger and he could drive me. The GM then tried to explain me that you can in fact buy Insurance without buying a car and that there are other options, but I again told him why the sales rep could not offer those options and left me hanging, wouldn’t care about the customer and just ghost me last night? There was some more back-and-forth, but no conclusion and he hung up the phone on me by saying he will not waste any more time on me.

Sometime later, my friend who was accompanying me might have also put out a one star review saying that this is a funny experience where you need to buy insurance first without even Test driving a car. after this review went up on Google Maps, the GM called me and went ballistic on the phone. He told me I was trying to launch a cyber attack on me and started threatening me and attacking me as a person he told me to go get a life to go get a job and one day, I’ll realise what I’m doing. I never lost my cool. I’m sure they have all the call records. He then proceeds to threaten me to give him my friends phone number since they didn’t have his contact. I told him it’s a public platform. I’ll review how I feel on Google Maps. then he tried to frame me as if I was lying by saying that I told them I had an insurance but actually did not. I reminded them that they have all the CCTV footage. In fact, the only reason all this happened was because I was honest about me not having auto Insurance. I’m sure people lie all the time, but I have never done that. He then proceeded to condescend me for the next 2-3minutes while I was silently listening. all I could ask him was this is this how you treat potential customers is this how you talk to a human you treat them like sub-humans?

This happened yesterday and and if you've read till now you deserve to know that this was Elliot Bay Autobroker on Aurora Ave. I would never give them any business, horrible experience."

Is it normal that a touchpad turns off when waking up from sleep? Only on Wayland,wayland,1i9tvzr,2025-01-25 13:48:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wayland/comments/1i9tvzr/is_it_normal_that_a_touchpad_turns_off_when/,claudiocorona93,,"My device is a HP EliteBook 840 G2. The touchpad uses the synaptics driver on Windows and usually gestures would stop working if the touchpad app is closed, usually while installing programs that require closing others. On Linux, I've tried with Bazzite, Fedora, Aurora, Bluefin, Kubuntu, BlendOS and VanillaOS. I noticed this never happened with Linux Mint so I changed to X11, and it stopped happening. It's a bummer because I really wanted to use Waydroid.


I've searched this problem and it looks like it's been happening for a good while."
Funny names or sayings for league things in other languages?,leagueoflegends,1i9tume,2025-01-25 13:46:29,3,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i9tume/funny_names_or_sayings_for_league_things_in_other/,ImmaEnder,,"Interested if there are any funny names for champions or things in other languages. For instance, in the Chinese scene many champions do have names that resemble what they're called in english, but many champions have literal names. Renekton is called ""alligator"", malphite is called ""rock person"", aurora is called ""rabbit"". Even smolder is called ""small fire dragon"". Baron nasher is called ""big dragon"", and the elemental dragons are called ""small dragon"". Can't really find info about this for other languages other than korean. "

Hi everyone! Continuing to clean out stuff that I've been holding onto for too long and won't get to build/make content given my new circumstances. 

Prices below include CONUS shipping. I'm willing to ship internationally if it comes to that, but we'll have to figure out extra shipping costs.

Feel free to send me reasonable offers, as I have been out of the market for a while. I can send more specific timestamps as requested, for those interested. Thanks for looking!

(Some items have timestamps at the end of the 14 day window, but I can provide newer ones as requested)

Will throw in one of the cheaper PBT keycap sets for very low price with the purchase of a keyboard! Can do bundle discounts just in general as well.

I also have literal dozens of other GMK sets and also switch sets, so if you are interested in buying a full kit or even a fully built board, let me know and I can probably find you a good combo from my collection.

New Player Questions,FleshandBloodTCG,1i9tp20,2025-01-25 13:39:43,3,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/FleshandBloodTCG/comments/1i9tp20/new_player_questions/,ficsitapologist,Question,"I’ve been playing card games online for about 10 years now, and I’m looking to get into a physical game. I used to be into Hearthstone and I’ve been seeing a lot of people say Flesh and Blood is similar but in a physical format. I’ve never played physical card games (outside of those with a standard 52 card deck), so forgive me if some of this is typically already understood. I’m wondering what tips/recommendations you would make to a new player looking to get started (and hopefully be able to play at a competitive level at some point), and also a few more specific questions.  I read the 16 page quick start guide, and I plan to watch the 15 minute video they have on the site as well as read the longer game manual over the next week. 

Before I get too deep into the reading and go to a shop for packs next weekend, I was wondering about a few things:

- Are the Aurora and Terra decks where new players should start, or is it okay to just go right into opening packs?

-Which format(s) should you focus on when starting out? I’d like to learn the strategy of the “normal” game so I can potentially participate in tournaments at some point, so preferably formats that line up with that.

-Should I buy certain sets/packs to start filling out my collection to make strong decks? Or should I go for specific packs depending on the class/playstyle I prefer?

-How much does the average person need to spend (without just outright buying the singles) in order to make 2-3 competitively viable decks? Not asking for anyone’s personal info/figures, just a ballpark estimate if there is one.

-Is the game in a healthy place? Just on an overall level, has the game been bringing in new people and ideas to keep things fresh without jeopardizing balance, out-pricing most players, or something to that effect.

-Lastly, is this what I’ve made it out to be? I want something that can scratch the itch that Hearthstone can give me, and of the online options I’ve found in the past couple years none really satisfied me. I’ve thought about getting into a physical card game for a while, but only really knew of the likes of Pokemon, MTG, and Yu-Gi-Oh. In Pokemon’s case, I always got the impression that most people got into it to collect the cards rather than play with them. But with all of them I always got the sense that I was so far behind everyone else given how long they’ve been out that it turned me off from ever trying them. Having found out about Flesh and Blood today and seeing it’s only a few years old and that it’s similar to Hearthstone has really been the majority of what piqued my interest. If there’s any other card game (digital or physical) that might be more in-line with what I’ve been describing, I’d be happy to learn about it.

Sorry if this was a bit of a ramble, I’d just really appreciate some guidance from the community before I really jump in to absorbing myself in a new game. Thanks for reading and for any help!"

AURORAs secret language,auroramusic,1i9tddl,2025-01-25 13:25:28,94,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9tddl,KayaCOOL_,,Hey everybody i found a translation on her secret lsnguage on Pinterest by marianagmrs (also more credits in the picture) and i have a different kind of human on vinyl where i noticed on the back it spelled “the mother is coming for you” i Think and also this poster i decoded that spelled “emotional. I just wanted to share svine i haven’t seen anybody decoding the vinyl☺️
So the aurora strip lights on the new 5000T are different from the regular auroras?,Corsair,1i9t4dc,2025-01-25 13:14:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Corsair/comments/1i9t4dc/so_the_aurora_strip_lights_on_the_new_5000t_are/,Accurate_Test_9993,Discussion,"It says ""integrated aurora lights"" whatever that means, but if you go the part list. These are not the parts or serials for the regular aurora lights.

So basically you can't just buy the base 5000T case and add the regular aurora lights?

Are these 5000T RGB version lights different from the regular auroras? How are they ""integrated""

If they fail, I suppose these are the replacement parts which are different from the regular aurora.

It seems they did this on purpose to force the customer to buy the more expensive RGB case rather than the barebones, so if you buy the barebone case, you can't use or integrate the new aurora lights that comes with the RGB case at $340

My name is Aurora so here’s a bit about me (you don’t have to read this but if you need a conversation starter it’s pretty good :) )

General - I am Croatian but living in Slovenia, I speak English, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian and Norwegian. I am 18 and in college (Psychology). I also work as a ‘secretary’ (it’s a bit more complicated) during the weekends and when I can during the week. Less interesting but still important, I am single and have schizotypal personality disorder (yes diagnosed, no I don’t hallucinate that’s not the same as schizophrenia, google is free)

Hobbies - I like playing guitar, drawing, cycling, hiking, reading, writing and less frequently due to time constraints I like ATV riding and hunting small game.

Interests - My favorite shows are, in no order, Helluva Boss (not hazbin hotel though), Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Ozark and House M.D.

My favorite movies are 2001:A Space Odyssey, Annihilation (my favorite) and Begotten.

My favorite books (and book series) are Watership Down (my favorite), Wings Of Fire, Warrior Cats and Hare House (this one isn’t actually about rabbits).

My favorite song is probably Second Hand by Dear Nora and my favorite musicians are Dear Nora, The Scary Jokes and Gezebelle Geburgably.

That’s about it so, I hope you message me! :)"

Do we think Raina’s interview confirms that Aurora actually exists? Is this a conspiracy that can be laid to rest now? Perhaps the bump changes were due to Aurora’s potential failure to thrive in the womb and/or being so small. Gypsy wanted to “look the part” and made her bump larger at times to fit with a normal pregnancy. Although it’s her specialty, she just isn’t very good at lying. She couldn’t keep up with the consistency of her fake bump size. What do you think?"

Yes, then I won’t block and win.” Sometimes I know if it will be a win or not even by round 3.

Is this where the game is at right now? Even after getting Red in the Ledgered 3 times in a row, I still can put my opponent into a corner and come out on top if I block you sculpt so I can threaten more damage than they could uninterrupted for 3 turns.

I mostly play Aurora, Zen, or Dash I/0. I know I can switch heros but not if I’m gonna get blasted the same way. 

Are there just not enough tools right now to deal with wide, high damage hero’s? Even Jarl kind of flopped at my local meta because his damage output is kind of lame."

Is it common for a Sim to have a very low friendship bar/full romance bar with another Sim and for that Sim to propose?,thesims,1i9pfgh,2025-01-25 10:33:49,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1i9pfgh/is_it_common_for_a_sim_to_have_a_very_low/,ElevenSpaceGoddess,Discussion,"Here’s the wild story of what just happened in my game:

My Sim, Aurora (non-committal, romantic, dance machine, spellcaster), has the aspiration to find ""The One."" She’s been playing the field, keeping a line of gentlemen callers. While she was in the middle of woohooing at another Sim's house, Caleb Vatore (her low-friendship/high-romance situationship) BURSTS into the house.

While they're still in the act, Caleb interrupts with a text box saying he's so smitten that he’s proposing marriage. The options were “Yes, of course!” or “No way!” Since Aurora’s aspiration is to find The One, I said yes.

Here’s the kicker: Aurora finishes woohooing, accepts Caleb’s proposal, and Caleb shakes hands with the other Sim! No jealousy, no fights, no red bars. Then he just chills and starts watching TV with the guy! Aurora dips and heads home, but Caleb shows up at her place again and just casually sits on the couch like nothing happened!

So, has anyone else had a Sim propose under such chaotic conditions?"

Found 1350W PSUs for sale on eBay and they look like a great deal, but don't want to screw up my system trying to upgrade the PSU since I honestly don't know what the heck I'm doing...i.e. no idea which plugs go to which components in the system. Read a couple posts by u/Awkward_Shape9511 that gets into pretty good detail about these, but not sure if the connections are the same in R16 as R13-R15s. Also, in the same posts, says something about native 12VHPWR instead of using the adapter for the 8-pin connectors...don't know why an adapter would be an issue or any less effective, maybe more risk of overheating/melting?

  
Any insight from anyone that's done this in R16 would be greatly appreciated!

  
And before anyone says you don't need to upgrade to a 1350W PSU, I'm planning on getting my hands on a 5090 FE whenever there's actually stock available and I know the 1000W is debatable on being able to deliver the amount of power needed for these new GPUs.

The thing is, she has a really unique story compared to all the other Disney princesses. Some of the girls end up with the first person that helps them out like Rapunzel and Eugene or happen stance or they’re kissed awake by their one true love like Aurora. 

Merida has options. She has three options all of which seemed to have a different personality and all of which could have something deeply in common with her. I’d love to see a princess decide and her thought process on what she wants. Merida, at the end of the movie, said she just wanted a choice and didn’t want the archery contest to be that final say. So a sequel could be her getting to know all three of them (maybe with a camping trip) and choosing who she wants.

We know through the deleted scenes, through the art book, through the supplemental material that she does choose someone on her own (and we know who). I just love to see the thought process and everything that goes into it.

I’m prepared for the downvotes. "

- Aurora grew up in the forest, right there makes them have something in common right away. Aurora grew up in it and Merida spends a lot of time in it. We don’t know exactly how Aurora grew up so it could be safe to assume she knows how to do something like fishing just to help provide food to herself and the family so she likes some outdoor activities. She spends a lot of time hiking and spending time with creatures in the woods that we do see. 

I have no other evidence to support this, but I think they’d have a really cute friendship.

The first stage is Repora, from ”repo” a term for fox in Finnish and aurora. It’s pure fire type.
The evolution is called Revonard, from ”revontulet” the word for the Northern lights but the direct meaning is fox’s fires, and renard which is the french word for fox. It is ice and fire type.

They are the two depictions of the Finnish fire fox. A pitch black fox with a tail that lights ablaze at night. And a white fox, perhaps an arctic fox, with a fiery tail with the colors of aurora."

Welcome to **Disinherited**, a story-driven Minecraft roleplay that blends political intrigue, personal ambition, and high-stakes drama in the thriving city of **Astralis**. 

# 🌟 The Premise

Astralis is a city of diversity and grandeur, ruled by the noble **Astrum family**, descendants of the Serene Goddess herself. The city thrives under their leadership, but peace is fragile. Decades ago, the illustrious **D'Arcey family** fell into obscurity after their last heir vanished, leaving the Astrums to take the throne. Now, a man named **Viktor Freidmont** has emerged, claiming to be the great-grandson of the lost heir.

Is Viktor truly a long-lost scion, or is he an ambitious pawn in a larger game? His rise is tied to the **Black Crown**, a shadowy cabal pulling strings from the city’s underbelly. As tensions rise, Queen **Aurora Astrum** must defend her throne from growing threats: the whispers of a ""Mad Prince"" in her family, noble pressure to secure her lineage, and the political chaos unleashed by Viktor's claim.

This is a world of **choices**, where **alliances will be forged**, **secrets unraveled**, and **power challenged**. Will you shape Astralis’ destiny—or see it fall?

# 🎭 Casting Call

We are currently looking for players to take on the following key roles, though if you wish to play a commoner, that is still open as well:

1. **A Corrupt Religious Leader**:
   * The leader of Astralis’ faith, whose actions and motives are steeped in corruption.
   * How or why they are corrupt can be worked out collaboratively—bring your creativity and intrigue!
2. **Nobles of Astralis**:
   * Join one of the established noble houses. 
   * Help flesh out the intricate web of alliances, rivalries, and ambitions that shape Astralis’ political landscape.

# 🌍 Features of Disinherited

* **Deep Lore and Worldbuilding**: Immerse yourself in Astralis, a city of humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, and lesser fey. Its history, politics, and underground markets create endless opportunities for storytelling.
* **Complex Characters**: Play a noble vying for influence, a commoner caught in the chaos, or even an enigmatic outsider. Every character has a role to play in the unfolding drama.
* **Political Intrigue and Roleplay**: Navigate alliances, rivalries, and betrayals. Will you support Viktor, the Astrums, or carve your own path?
* **Dedicated Writing Team:** Whether you join us before the server opens or months after, a dedicated team of writers will help you craft your character and storylines so you can dive right in and immediately be apart of the action. 
* **A Thriving Map and Modpack**: Explore a custom-built world with mods tailored to enhance the experience, from rich cityscapes to mysterious hidden markets.

A full **Google Doc with additional lore** is available below help you dive deeper into the world and craft your character.

Interested? Comment below or DM me for more details! We’ll provide everything you need to get started, including a character application, a short nobility quiz (for those interested in playing nobles), and access to our lore doc.

It is however my birthday, so here's a one-off present to people who aren't The Kodster's and Crybrows' biggest fans... 

\---------

Dear Diary 

I’m feeling quite lonely today, as Kody is in Huntsville, L-abama. I told him he should go and see Madison to try to patch things up, so that I can film with more of my grandkids to rehabilitate my image. Sadly though, he ended up in Madison County instead because he forgets he’s got daughters with Janelle. It’s all very embarrassing to me to say the least, and if he’s there overnight he knows he’s got to buy me a new precious moments figurine to make up for it. I hear my personal cellular phone ringing and see it’s Kody so I pick up straightaway. 

“Hey Raaaabyn, how’s it going?"" I am about to reply when Kody cuts me off, saying ""Raahbs, listen up a minute, yeah, just keep your loyal mouth shut and don't nag me. I've decided I’m going to do you a favour today and just let you deal with all the children, mmkay. And I don’t owe you this favour, right - I don't owe any wives any favours - but it’s my gift to you because you are shy and pretty and loyal. So don’t let yourself or them do anything that would make me resent them or make me not want to love all of you. Laters.”

Before I can reply, he’s hung up. I put my personal cellular phone down and frown a bit. I'm not really sure why it's called that, I mean it doesn't have any cellulite, just like me, but even if I had, Kody would totally love me because he loved my sister wives even though they had stretch marks and had to walk sideways like a crab through any turnstiles. I sigh deeply. Well shucks, Robyn, looks like it’s just you and the kiddos today, maybe we should go out for a fun family lunch and perhaps a bit of shopping now that the coast is clear. 

I head downstairs and make my way over to Aurora and Breanna who are giggling, sitting down by the fireplace. I overhear Breanna joking about making a break for freedom by wriggling up the chimney. I put on my best frowny face and clear my throat and remind them about loyalty to their celestial spirtual father, Kody, and also about the Rumour Mill. Their smiles are gone and their faces turned white. I ask them what they’re doing. They say they’re playing monopoly and would I like to join. 

Well sure I would! This game involves buying property, which is one of my only skills. I roll the dice, and Aurora tells me I have to pick up a card . Oh no, I think, it says “go straight to jail”! I frown about it - I'm too shy and pretty for jail - so I bow my head and join together my hands and I pray out loud to Heavenly Father. I ask him to protect me from jail and also to find me a 7 bedroom rental, so that we don’t have to steal Janelle’s 401K to buy yet another mansion. I hear the angels singing. They tell me that I’m free, and that I can move to Boardwalk and get it for free. I smile. This is the America I learned about in school! 

15 minutes later I own every property on the board so I suggest that we should go and celebrate that by having a spot of lunch somewhere. I try to remember which restaurants we are still welcome at in Flagstaff. I frown. We certainly can’t go back to Salsa Brava - we were unfairly banned from there just because Kody ordered a 8 lemon waters and sugar and made us lots of free lemonade, also because we made spiritual congress in the disabled toilets. I also can’t risk Josephine’s because Savannah may be waitressing today and she’s not allowed to talk to my tender children because her mother is not a good sister wife. Looks like it’s going to be Fat Olives. 

I load my children in the back of the car, drive off, and get a few traffic tickets from playing on my phone while driving to Fat Olives. I park up and desperately try to recall what it is I can actually feed on, other than money. I guess I will just stick to a salad of some sort, at least that’s also green… 

I sure hope tomorrow is better! "

# [Not Another Vampire Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18923798-not-another-vampire-book) by Cassandra Gannon

> What’s worse than editing the stupidest romance novel ever written? Getting stuck inside of it. Karalynn Donnelly has somehow been transported into Eternal Passion at Sunset, a vampire love story filled with enough clichés, anachronisms, and run-on sentences to drive any hardworking book editor insane.
>
> To make matters worse, Kara accidentally prevents the story’s hero and heroine from meeting. Now Slade, the idiot Vampire King, thinks Kara’s his destined mate. If she’s going to find her way home, Kara needs to get this story back on track. But, teaming up with Damien, the novel’s handsome, super-powered bad guy might not be the best place to start…

# [Rules for Ghosting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202468408.Rules_for_Ghosting) by Shelly Jay Shore

> Rule #1: They can't speak.
> Rule #2: They can't move.
> Rule #3: They can't hurt you.
>
> Ezra Friedman sees ghosts, which made growing up in a funeral home a bit complicated. It might have been easier if his grandfather’s ghost didn’t give him such scathing looks of disapproval as he went through a second, HRT-induced puberty, or if he didn't have the pressure of all those relatives—living and dead—judging every choice he makes. It’s no wonder that Ezra runs as far away from the family business as humanly possible.
>
> But when the floor of his dream job drops out from under him and his mother uses the family Passover seder to tell everyone that she’s running away with the rabbi’s wife, Ezra finds himself back in the thick of it. With his parents’ marriage imploding and the Friedman Family Memorial Chapel on the brink of financial ruin, Ezra agrees to step into his mother's shoes and help out . . . which means long days surrounded by ghosts that no one else can see.
>
> And then there's his unfortunate crush on Jonathan, the handsome funeral home volunteer who just happens to live downstairs from Ezra's new apartment . . . and the appearance of the ghost of Jonathan's gone-too-soon husband, Ben, who is breaking every spectral rule Ezra knows.
>
> Because Ben can speak. He can move. And as Ezra tries to keep his family together and his heart from getting broken, he quickly realizes that there's more than one way to be haunted—and more than one way to become a ghost.

>
> In a land ruled by ruthless Fae, twenty-one-year-old Lore Alemeyu’s village is trapped in a forested prison.

2. They survived a planet, by themselves, for literal years, that could be colonized considering they LITERALLY COLONIZED IT SOMEWHAT BY THEMSELVES.
3. It sucks to have the generic ""bad ending"" after everything that has led up to going home. The sea emperor, the volcanos, the dead zone, raiding the aurora, everything. And the ""funny"" epilogue shits on it.

I don't care if it was supposed to be funny or something, it fucking sucks.

We were quite literally better off on the damn ocean planet filled with horrors than corporate earth."

I just started playing Star Citizen and sometimes things happen I can’t explain.

Now I have the problem that the ship doesn’t lift off when I hit the spacebar.

 

Then, when I press the ‘B’ button, it does work.

When I am out in space, and press ‘B’ again, it should toggle the shields but no shields come up.

Also, again, no power to accelerate or fly. As if the engines are shut off.

 

Pressing ‘B’ again lets me fly.

In the hangar there is no repair needed according to the menu.

 

What could cause this?"
