My character died today,oblivion,1i2phpl,2025-01-16 08:58:49,843,0.98,92,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i2phpl,sketch_for_summer,Character,"Marlin's journey started on December 18th 2024. This is my first earnest attempt at doing the Permadeath challenge with no exploits or save-scumming. After 70 hours of play time, he has finally perished. A swinging mace trap caught me off guard in Fort Homestead.

Marlin's passion was talking to people. He made friends everywhere he went. He had just bought a wonderful house near Leyawiin with a herd of sheep and a pond of swans and ducks.

His last quest was Misdirection ‚Äî having stolen Hromir's Ice staff, he decided to try his hand at combating some marauders in an old fort on the other coast of the lake. There, he found his final resting place. His enchanted rapier was taken by the raiders and his magic box he used as a home led to a war between marauding parties.

Ask me anything that pertains to my personal self-imposed rules, details of this run, strategy I used with this character, anything you wish to know. Check out my other post where I shared an anecdote about Marlin's attempt of stealing the tax records from the Imperial Guards. üòâ"
At what point does one stand their ground in a community and not try to run away? ,Marxism,1hzgkh4,2025-01-12 01:21:54,0,0.39,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/1hzgkh4/at_what_point_does_one_stand_their_ground_in_a/,Current_Barnacle5964,,"
Hello everyone. I am a new poster here. I don't know what I would classify myself as at least as far as being a leftist goes. All I know is I am anti-capitalist and *extremely* anti-  authoritarian. I am doing more research into anarchy and council communism but so far I'm just trying to take my time.

Anyways for the main point I recently got very very lucky and was able to secure a worker's visa in France. I must say I do like things here a lot better than the United States. The food and the culture and the history and a culture of protests. I won't incriminate myself but I was a bit of a rascal back in Uncle Sam's backwards country. I won't go any farther than that. In France I feel as though I can fully push myself to the edge of my persona and beyond as I don't have to save face with Americans back home who could not stomach any kind of protests. As if corporations truly had feelings. At least in so far as I have spoken with.

One thing I do miss was being able to have a gun. Not because I desire for guns, for truthfully I'd rather live in a world where such a thing would no longer be seen as necessary as they would be the last taps on the links of chains that thunder away in the distance, a memory of a bygone era. A violent era. Rather I miss them because of what they represented to me. The will to stand up and the will to fight back. Even though I hate the murders and violence and abuse that these pieces have bought about I cannot deny my admiration for them. The great equalizer. 

As an individual with a visa I cannot necessarily just go into a store and buy an ar-15 in France like it was a fire sale on croissans and baguettes. I hope this comes as no surprise. I left my guns behind in a safe place. I remember them even now. Cold hard steel with some having wood and others plastic. A Ruger Mark IV. An m1911. A Ruger gp100. A Mossberg 590 retrograde shotgun. A marlin 45-70 lever action rifle. But I instead tried to immigrate, and here I am with none of them.

Immigration is as natural to us human beings as breathing. Ever since we left our cradle in Africa we have been to every continent on planet earth. We also immigrated for different reasons too. But something that always got to me was the individual such as myself. Someone who could run away or stay and fight. I figured to myself that there is only so much running away one can do before eventually one backs themselves into a corner. 

Maybe the United States will collapse. Shit maybe it collapses as I sit here across the pond. But I get angry seeing all of the injustice back there. The homelessness. The poverty. Those who aged out of orphanages. The healthcare system. The prison system. The cops. And so much more. I get so angry seeing all of it, and I just don't understand how anyone can look and see such desolations and stomach them.

Abominations and mutations and deviations. That's all we're gonna find if we look inside of these beautiful whitewashed tombs filled with dead men's bones. Yet this is home for me. For many of us of American origin. Maybe I am crazy considering moving back. I hate the country. Its greed. It's thirst for malice and for cruelty and its attempts to dominate and control all life. But that hatred won't go away just leaving the country. After all if the United States sneezes the rest of the world catches a damn cold practically. And of course who's to say that other countries won't follow suit? Knock one down and another one like a cockroach springs up from under the floorboards.

Anyways I'm sure I haven't made sense with my weird rant-filled musings. In a way i would not mind dying back in the new world. I have Mexican ancestry in me, being the child of Mexican parents who thought bringing me to the colonizers up north would be better (it wasn't) and by extension indigenous ancestry in me. I feel it would be such a waste to at least not resist and fight back against the nation and frankly history itself that has genocided and raped and taken the land and culture and languages and way of life of all of those in the new world. They still do too.

At the end of the tourney, CJ takes the last tourney fish (like the mahi mahi and the umbrella octopus), so while they'll show up in your catalogue, they don't stay in you inventory and can't be bought or sold through market boxes. However seasonal fish and event fish (like the lumpfish) stay in your inventory and can be bought and sold. so if you aren't a day 1 player you can't totally complete your fish catalogue, but I made a chart with all the fish that are available thru market boxes and you can use it as a checklist. anything not on this list is a tourney fish and no longer available to buy

The top 30 most dangerous creatures in my setting,worldbuilding,1gj43ob,2024-11-03 21:30:21,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1gj43ob/the_top_30_most_dangerous_creatures_in_my_setting/,PigMunch2024,Prompt,"On this wonderful day, we will go over is a list of some critters you don't want to meet if you're on in my world, or  if you decide to come here for, which in itself is a terrible idea 

30, Adipocaudateus, sometimes shortened to ""Addies""

This creature, Name meanimg ""fat tail"" due to its ability to store fat in their tails like leopard geckos, is a species of giant predatory amphibian in the Megamanderidae family, for those who aren't science geeks, that just means it's a giant salamander 

There are many species, though to avoid making this post so long that it can't be posted, we'll just focus on the common, Adipocaudateus brevis 
Their color ranges from greenish Brown to jet black, as their name suggests their tails are fat and  stubby like that of a leopard gecko, they have smooth slimy skin, and sometimes spots or stripes depending on species 

Their head is more elongated than most salamanders the more comparable to a Komodo dragon's head than anything, usually has 10 to 12 hours, 56 on each side of their head, and sometimes a pair of the top, and yes they are very good vision, 

At the tip of their elongated heads where their nostril should be there are two tentacles which are used for a sense of smell, which is 3,000 times better than that of a bloodhound

They have good sized mouths with dozens of sharp serrated teeth 
Their legs are muscular and very thick complete with large and sharp claws

It is about, 10 ft long, 3 ft tall, and weighing 300 to 600 lbs, so they are on par with a good sized alligator, just a lot taller, also they can stand on their hind legs





, as you can see, they are carnivorous, but I unlike RL salamanders, they are not limited to what they can fit into their mouth, they're serrated teeth and sharp claws allows for tearing in the large prey and swallowing them in chunks 

In short bursts, they can reach speeds of 25 mph, and if one of them ends up catching you, you'll be gifted with a bite  force of 10,000 PSI or five tons of pressure 

Some species are also poisonous, so not something you would want t accidentally touch either

Salt is an effective deterrent though 

Inhabits rainforests, jungles and swamps so if you don't want to meet an Addie, you know we're not to go

29, Astrotheieum, meaning ""star beast""

It is a giant two-headed tortoise, named for the star like markings on its shell

The shell of the turtle is usually dark blue to Brown  in color, it's belly is soft and has no plastron,  and it has two heads, attached to two very long necks, like a sauropod dinosaur

It is about 60, 40 ft tall, and weighs 40 to 50 tons 

It is herbivorous,  feasting on trees and giant mushrooms and as an adult has no natural predators, yeah, I'm not really sure I even need to explain why a turtle the size of a semi truck is dangerous, so I'll just leave that to the imagination 

It inhabits forrsts, Meadows and grasslands, 



27, Jadefish 

The Jadefish is a species of quadrops shark and is utopia's largest shark, it's species name ""quadrops shark"" comes from the fact that all sharks in the species have four eyes 

Q sharks comi n two varieties, gulpers and rippers, Jadefish are gulpers

The shark is black  with white spots all over its body except belly, which allows it to blend in with the night, , because these sharks are mostly nocturnal, and it has two dorsal fins 


Their skin is smooth to the touch but very elastic like latex, touching the shark  kinda feels like touching a  condom,  except... the size of an ice cream truck and with more muscle and a cartilaginous skeleton

It has whiskers around its mouth like that of a catfish, which in addition to its ability to detect electrical fields and it's superb sense of smell, to add insult the fact that it has for Goddamn eyes means you will be having a VERY bad day should you end up coming across one in the warm tropical waters they live in 

The range extends from the Abogailian ocean all the way to the East Coast of Albatos, , the water's there or as warm as bathwater, which allows them to thrive

They have hundreds of teeth in their mouth, dozens of maxillary and mandibular teeth , as well as a rather large crown of teeth in the roof of their mouth

 unlike a great white shark, the teeth are not serrated because they are meant to grip prey,, not cut through flesh, the teeth are simply pointed and face backwards,, like the teeth of a python

The sharks Jaws and stomachs are very expandable,, in order for them  to swallow their  main prey, Beeping Billies

These are fish that are about 42 ft long and can weigh up to 11 tons, a little more than twice the size of the Jadefish , in some regions please fish can make up half their diet


Females are typically 25 to 30 ft long with an average weight of 4 to 5 tons, relation get bigger,, according to the locals (the Bubbleheads) the largest Jadefish apricot was at least 40 ft long and it weighed 7.5 tons, well don't expect this, it's pretty rare for them to get this big


They are much more terrifying than your typical great white or bull shark, not only because there are more aggressive, but because they swallow their prey alive, anything small enough to fit into their mouth is on the menu

If a Jaws movie featured a jadefish instead of a great white, there wouldn't be any gore,, only vore


26, Billers, name so because of their rectangular dollar bill shaped brains 

 I want to get into fancy scientific terms, they are giant pill bugs/rollies / woodlice-2 the Abogailia rainforest, as well as Meadows grasslands of a few other continents 


They have 20 legs, shiny black shells, and two very large compound eyes which allow them to see nearly all the way around them, so sneaking up behind one isn't an option 

The front legs are enlarged and end in machete like blades, similar to a mantis
On the underside of their bodies they have two microphone shape tubes called bollery glands, akin to mammary glands, which squirt out a rainbow colored jelly known as pre-growth fluid, what's their babies eat once they hatch when we exoskeletons harden

They also have a bass organ on the underside of their bodies which allow them to commit very low frequency sounds which can be 140 decibels or more


These bugs are about 20 ft long and they weigh up to six tons


They are herbivores but still very dangerous if they feel threatened, 

The shells are armored, so they have no natural predators, p I'm in short bursts they can reach speeds of more than 60 mph, so if they chase you and you try to run you have a good 3 seconds before they catch you, and using those front legs they will rip you open like a Christmas present 

They are very protective of their eggs and those that have recently molted and have soft shells, etc so that's one thing that will piss them off if you try to mess with ,m well they will probably try to get you if you piss them off

26, all spiders, that's because all spiders are giant and they'll eat you for breakfast lunch and dinner 

35, Beeping Billies , named for the beeping sound that they make to communicate with one another, so they can communicate using other sounds as well

They are the fish that we discussed that the Jade fish eat, they are very large fish that look a bit like a cross between a perch and a dolphin 

They are silver like your typical fish, , a few key differences being that they have long snouts like a dolphin, 

They grow to about 42 ft long and they weigh up to 11 tons, keep that in mind when you consider what we'll discuss next 

They are carnivorous, but you don't have to worry about them eating you, there's been snouts mean a mackerel sized fish is about the biggest thing they can eat 

 
They aren't usually very aggressive, the danger comes from the fact that like dolphins they are able to , I didn't launch their entire body out of the water like dolphins or Marlin, a Beepng Billy  will absolutely wreck your boat, and if you get hit by one that decides to jump, best believe it'll break every bone in your body 

We can also destroy trucks transporting the fish to market if they're unloaded on too early and people have been injured trying to get the nets undone when transporting a bus-sized fish like this


Swimming with them is pretty safe, it's just that hand feeding is not recommended, their snouts are still filled with very sharp teeth,, and if they miss the mackerelict that you happen to be feeding them and end up catching your hand inst, they can easily take your hand off


You want a they taste great on a steak and when fried,


25, the giant Thorned cricke


A giant insect native to the rainforest of Abogailia,, disclaimer, don't vacation here if you don't like bugs 



The giant Thorn cricket is jet black, with large spikes on a thorax, the males have wings what you doing all of them to fly thank God, thank crustacea I mean,, but they are just for chirping, the females have no wings at all

They have very long antenna , large heads with very large mandibles and sharp spikes all over their legs


They are about the size of a dog for males, the females are about 13 to 14 ft long not including antenna,  8 to 9 ft tall with a weight of 150 to 200 lb, so if you saw one in your house and they'd be up to your ceiling,


They are omnivorous so anything is on their diet including meat 

If they decided they want meat today and that happens to be you, 
They'll jump and boy can they jump

They're able to jump horizontally up to 200 ft,  and up to 50 ft high, and if they want to run they can reach speeds of 70 to 80 mph 

You might not notice until the air is knocked out of you from this cricket jumping on you, and the next thing you feel is sharp mandibles  ripping through your flesh,, they're not the quickest at, so you might be alive for more than 15 minutes while they eat you alive 

24, pine cone puffers, named for their armored plates which look like the scales of a pine cone 


These plates are made of Davidium, an organic compound only found on Utopia would you take the place of keratin in certain reptiles and fish here

The difference being that this is much stronger than keratin, also if you were to touch a creature that had scales or pipes made of Davidium it would be very smooth to the touch, like porcelain or clay pottery that has had over glazed decoration added to it,

Each one of these plates on a pine cone puffer is about the size of an iPad, will some of these points can be as big as closed laptops 

Pine cone poppers are jets except their bellies, and they have four eyes, one on each side of their head as per most, as well as an extra two on the top 

Uninflated, they are about 46 ft long and can weigh up 15 tons, nails are much smaller at 20 ft and 4 tons but no less deadly


Inside of their mouths, they have all of their teeth fused together to form what is essentially a beak, a deadly blade of enamel purposed for death and destruction 

The jaw muscles that this beak is attached to can clamp down with 100,000 pounds of force, sometimes 200,000, which is 50 to 100 tons, perfect for crunching through pickup truck sized lobsters,, car sized crabs, giant clams and oysters and sea urchins and ripping through the flesh of stingrays more than five times their size, they can use only make short work of you, that's exactly what they would do if they found you swimming about in the ocean, you would be a welcome snack 


23, the giant River crab, Megacrustacea Moses 

Do you know what a blue crab looks like? Well imagine instead of blue claws this has jet black claws, and three eye stalks instead of two 


And its name, it is native to rivers, as well as lakes and ponds all throughout Lrmonada and Abogailia 


These crabs are about 15 ft across and weighing up to 4,000 lb or 2 tons, 

They're another commonly eaten food here by the locals, boiled in a swimming pool with all kinds of seasoning and you might want to try it too it tastes great plus you don't have meat for days 


The only problem is catching these crabs think of them transported and cooked


We are omnivores and scavengers, but that doesn't mean it will get there occasional hunt in when needed, we can leap upwards to grab fish or anything swimming above their heads and depending on how deep the body of water is in, they can leave upwards and snatch things from the land that come to drink 

If you get snatched by a giant River crab, you can kiss your ass goodbye, they can pinch with up to 100 tons of force,, though I'm betting they won't use this much force just to eat their prey, just enough Force to hold you in place while they eat you alive 

You better hope you drown quick because they like to take their sweet ass time, savor the flavor of their meals 

Now if you manage to get them on land and they happen to feel threatened they probably will pinch you with full force which will slice you in half 

22, the Abogailian giant Leech


Due to its massive size, this leech doesn't drink blood, it is carnivorous 

They've got three stomachs, an emergency,, a secondary storage, and a digestion chamber

The emergency chamber is designated for when food becomes scarce, swallowed prey is stored here I'm coated with antiseptic mucus to prevent rotting so they can last as long as possible, for this reason they can last decades to centuries without food 


These leeches are 50 to 60 feet long and they can weigh 15 to 20 tons,, if they manage to catch you they would slurp you down like spaghetti, 


21, Guacomolias, name so because they resembled giant avocado monsters , they are reptiles but they have the amphibian like  ability to absorb water through their skin, specifically their underbelly

They have eight short and stubby legs, not spider legs, more like crocodilian legs,, they have green skin which is scaly and slimy
I also have seven eyes, two on each side of the head and three large eye stalks at the top 

They have EXTREMELY large mouths which would not needing to unhing the job can be up to 8 ft wide inside that mouth is three rows of teeth on each jaw 

One wrote of teeth curves backwards to prevent prey from
The other row is straight and conical for crunching shells and bones
,
And the third row is serrated, for pairing flash, as well as a crown of teeth on the roof of their mouth 

All of these are massive about the size of a TV remote 

They have a 20-in long tongue, inside the top there is a long black tentacle that is rolled up when not in use, when it spots prey,, it will stick out its tongue and then peel the tongue back like a banana,, and then that tentacle will quickly uncoil and grab the prey and pull it into its mouth, which can deliver a bite force of over 60,000 pounds, but sometimes more than 120,000 pounds, the tentacle can be up to 90 ft long when fully extended


The females are the apex predators in the respective habitats, and utopia's largest land predator, ,, at 36 ft long and weighing 22.6 tons which would make them about three times the size of a T-Rex, they could easily gobble one up BTW,

 with males being 15 ft long and 1 to 2 tons 

They're based off of a giant version of a Pac-Man frog which means they are ambush predators. So if you see an area where multiple trees are knocked down or cleared out of the way and a very large green rock in the center, that's a massive predator and it will snack on you if you get close, they eat absolutely anything that's big enough to fit in their mouth
And if you're too big to be swallowed, they'll scrape you against their top teeth until you're in small enough pieces to be swallowed


They have an average lifespan of 40,000 years, with males only being 12 to 20 years

20, <megalotls giant oceanic axolotls,

They eat anything that fits in their mouth, and there Utopia the largest vertebrate,m they have both Baileen and teeth, and the throats are large enough that they can eat both Plankton and large prey, they so if they run out of large prey, they can switch to plankton

They're about 300 ft long and they weigh 500 to 1,000 tons, so about the size of Godzilla,, just missing that last 89,000 tons, the males are tiny in comparison, that only 15 ft off and one ton

I'm not sure I need to explain why this is dangerous so we'll just skip ahead

19, giganta rays

, The stingrays are gray to dark blue, sometimes having spots and they have a cream white underbelly, they also have four eyes, two on the underside and two eye stalks 

The females are about 50 to 60 ft wide, 65 to 70 ft long, and they weigh 50 to 60 tons. The males are 30 ft long, 20 ft wide and 5 to 10 tons

It's common for locals in my world to go and watch their  breeding migrations at night when Beacon is full,  this is when the females gathering groups and swim around aimlessly with their cloacas dilated wide open up to 15 ft wide, with a constant stream of eggs billowing out behind them like a giant crop duster but with eggs

The low and bassy but musical sounds they make to communicate with each other and to alert the males to fertilize the eggs during these migrations, as well as watching them actually migrate is pretty interesting and very beautiful to, just don't get in the water with them under any circumstances, you have double danger to deal with

They are opportunistic carnivores, so any Little critter they see is a midnight  snack, and if they feel threatened they might sting you
That Barb at the end of their tail is 6 ft long and the venom gland can weigh up to 500 lb s when completely full, in one stimg, bacon inject upwards of 50 gallons of venom


19, Deinoscorpius, meaning ""terrible scorpion 


This looks like an emperor, except along with its front CL. Each one of its ten legs has a pair of small claws, instead of a stinger at the end of its tail, there are crap like claws comfort in microscopic mesh which oozes venom through when the calls are squeezed shut, like when pinching

The scorpion is about 12 to 13 ft long and it weighs 1500 lb, it has six very large eyes and unlike earthly scorpions you can see very well 


They can be both active predators and ambush predators, and you'll be subject to a horrible fate if you get caught, 



They can run at 65 mph in short bursts and if they catch you, you'll be subject to getting pinched and injected with venom powerful enough to kill a hippopotamus,, if they forget to do that step, you'll be subject to its chelecerae, ripping through clothes skin and flesh, and spitting in digestive enzymes and then slurping up your partially liquid flesh well you're still alive 

The best thing to do to avoid these massive scorpions is to avoid large holes in the ground

 18, the Biller killer 


This is a giant tarantula similar to a Goliath birdeater and utopia's largest spider 


The spider's body is black and it has a pattern of black and white stripes on its legs it also comes equipped with very large fangs about 12 to 15 in Long,

They can grow up to 20 ft long ,, I like span of 30 ft I can wait up to a ton or 2,000 lba,

Their diet consist Billers, which is why they have those massive facts, they also have very potent venom, they live in large burrows surrounded by non-sticky silk, which helps the spiders find prey considering their eyesight isn't very good

So although this web is not sticky, once you walk on this, you've entered yourself into a deadly  game of Marco Polo


17, GI-ants

These aren't as big as many of the other creatures we discussed, but they are still quite big, at 3 in Long and weighing more than 10 g, these are ants the size of mice 

They look like giant carpenter ants 

They live in huge colonies that can contain over a billion individuals but it's usually a few hundred thousand, and what's, each one of these aunts have a bite force of 500 to 600 lb, you don't want to fall into a nest of one of these,, death by a thousand bites and stings 

Even know the strip a car gets down to the bones in a  matter of 5 minutes

16, Ablopods,,
These are essentially gigantic eels that have evolved to live on land, the species of focus right now is Bacon Ablopid, it ain't so because of it's bacon-shaped tongue which it sticks out as a display of dominance, so do not eat bacon coming to Utopia 



They have 12 eyes, six on each side of their head but underdeveloped so they can't see very well but they make up for that with their sense of smell, which is 10 times better than that of a grizzly bear, they have very large mouths with sharp serrated teeth, and their pectoral fins when they were actually ills have been replaced with short and stubby legs 

They are about 10 ft long and weigh 500 l, but sometimes 8, so about the size of a tiger, but they are much more dangerous than a tiger, since they will gladly gift you with a bite force of 8,000 PSI, and they're also not picky about what they eat


15,  Slobsters, name so because of the gross misses they leave after finishing a meal 

Bear giant terrestrial octopuses, well actually they are called decapuses because they have 10 tentacles rather than eight


There are mutually a reddish brown color, but they can change their car to blend in with their surroundings, and more terrifyingly they can change their smell in order to blend in even further or lure the prey

They are native to the jungles and rainforests of Abogailia, but some species live on other continents but we'll get to those another time

They are about 30 ft across and they weigh one to two tons


They are car,novores, their diet consisting mostly  of Billers but they're not very picky about what they eat

Their beaks can deliver 60,000 lb of pressure, and they can inject venom powerful enough to kill a blue whale, they have two venom glands in their mouth, one gland prod Alphatoxin, they can mix the two venoms together at will and control which venom they use, as well as control whether or not they use it at all 

More terrif, being an octopus at, on top of having venom and more neurons, means that they are highly intelligent, more so than primates or even JP's raptors

Ever seen Jurassic Park for the raptors know how to open doors?, Slobsters know how to put a key into a lock, turn the key and open the door, they even know how to knock, that way they ca  THW bubbleheads out. Though depending on the door they can just rip the door off its hinges and squeeze itself in to the house, cephalopods can squeeze into tiny spaces as long as they can get their beaks in 

And the final terrifying fact, hey not only kill for fun,, but also enjoy the suffering of their prey, for example they will sometimes eat an Adipocaudateus m tail first while still alive, without enhancing venom just to listen to it screaming in agony, for forcefully copilate with a an Ablopid while they eat it alive, and if they have beef with each other, eat their eggs, we would basically be edible toys for them 

14, the giant 20-eyed catfish, 50 ft long, weighs 40 tons, has a giant mouth, you put the rest of the pieces together 


13,  the Bubbleheads, the humanoid  race in my setting 


They're about 7 to 8 ft tall and they weigh 70 to 100 lb s, then dark blue to burgundy skin, and two large eye stalks on their round bulbous heads 


The Abogailians are usually peaceful, but pissed him off real bad, and you'll catch these claws, , 5 minutes away also, you better hope they don't have an electric  with them

The arrows on these bows have downward facing spikes, making it extra hard to get them out

12, ambush prawns 

Google picture of a giant River prawn, now imagine that, just 20 ft long not including its claws and weighing one ton

They dig out elaborate square shaped burrows with a network of tunnels 


The reservoir is square-shaped, and is set up essentially like a pond, the entrance to the burrow is underwater and has a vast network of tunnels call off with one of these tunnels connected to a river to ensure that the reservoir and burrow is filled with water at all 

So if you're walking through the swamp can you see a perfectly square pond, for the Love of crustacea DO NOT GO NEAR IT

11, megagastropods

They are giant aquatic slugs, not nudibranchs, these are fresh water and they look like a giant garden slug 

They have three eye stalks, two smaller chemicals under the eye stock used for, and two giant ones which are used for defense against predators, so don't think you can just go around pissing them off just because they're big and slow, they won't be slow and they use those big tentacles to smack the hell out of you


They're also 40 ft long and weigh 78 times 


Another defense they have is covering small predators with  nacre, the same substance that is used by oysters to make pearls, should they feel threat and do this to you, you end up getting pearled alive 


10, pulmonate giant hornets 

Rather than black and yellow, these hornets are black and orange, and have spiky legs and big stingers

They are about two feet long with a wingspan of 6 ft, and they can wait up to 15 lb, so you're dealing with a hornet the size of a turkey 

Fighting them off it's pretty easy if you can do it, though doing it right is not easy

Will sting you, getting hit with a stinger the size and thickness of an erect penis is no fun, and they're venom is twice as powerful as the venom of an Inman Taipan 

If they don't, they'll bite you,, and they can fight with up to 1,000 PSI but $600 to 800 is more common 

And if you happen to be a mobile, they'll chop you into pieces and take you back to the nest that's food for the larvae and queen, the Queens can we have to, 2,000 lb and are too big to move, only serving one purpose and that's laying eggs

If you see these hornets,, you better run and take cover,, don't run if you don't have cover to take though

It's a bird, it's a plane,, it's a big ass wasp 


 

9, Adolphia 
This is a giant lizard with amphibian traits, some species are able to croak like frogs, and all species can absorb water through their bellies, so the species we are focusing, A, Oreo can't croak but it can roar, hopefully you've seen my post where I've actually managed to recreate the roar 


The species is jet black except belly, with white spots,, in between those white spots is a series of yellow spots, 


Adolphia has very scary skin, the scales are made of Davidium, who this is one shiny lizard indeed, 


It has a long tal,, but Iunike most li, it does not drag its tail on the ground, went on all fours it's tail is held well above the ground like a dinosaur, it's lazy to drag your tail on the ground 

Its head is elongated a bit like a komodo dragon or megalania, and it has six eyes, two on each side of the head and two on the top 

It has two very large bulbs that look like nipples  on each side of each jaw, these are NOT nipples, they are specialized and highly sensitive sensory organs Billings's organs,, 

They have two features 

The first feature is The identical purpose of the Jacobson's organs found in snakes, the other thing it allows them to do is detect electrical fields of their prey a bit like sharks
, 
They also have two of these inside of his mouth, when the Adolphia looks out it's forked tongue and flex it back in, impresses that tongue to the opening of these organs, similar snakes, the ones inside of the mouth can't detect the electrical fields

Talking about inside of the mouth, here's the part where I can say that the inside of his mouth is blue and flares out a bit when they roar due to the light expandability of the jaw, this isn't to the degree of snakes, put these lizards can swallow something the size of a large, whole anything bigger will use their teeth and claws to rip 

They have very large teeth in their mouth,, two rows of them, and they're all sharp and serrated


They have very sick and muscular legs with extremely large and sharp claws, optimized for digging and dirt and digging into flesh



, the females are 30 ft long, 10 ft tall when standing on all fours and they can wait up to 3 tons, the males are about the size of your typical saltwater crocodile 

There are opportunistic predators and,, feasting on freshly billers, juveniles babies and eggs of  Astrotheieum, other reptiles in am,, invertebrates, , snails and slugs, they will even fish for Jadefish,, pulling out of the water and eat them, they're even known to be canned upon a stick especially after meeting

Electrically have giant backward facing on the dingalongs, after they mate,, the angry females will probably be keen on eating the males, especially after the pain she had to go through 

This is more extreme than cats, sometimes the meeting ends with these spikes having chunks of flesh from inside the cloaca still stuck to them, so when courtship it can be quite rough


After their danger to you, An Adolphia would gladly make a meal out of you, your teeth and claws would make little to no work of your tender flesh, and they can run it 30 miles an hour 


The best thing to do is climb a tree and then climb on to the adjacent large mushroom, but make sure the tree, or take cover in a building 

If you use a tree, make sure that the tree is over 40 feet, they can jump at least 30 ft in the air to snatch her out of trees less than t


8, Boulderfiah
You know what a stonefish is now imagine that but the size of a pickup truck,

You don't have to worry about stepping on them and getting injected with, what you have to worry about is getting sucked into their giant vacuum cleaner mouth 

Giant cone snails, same principle 

Titan clams 

These clams are up to 50 ft wide, 60 ft long and can we have to 25 tons, it's pretty common for divers to either get pearled alive Brenda trapped inside the clams,, running out of oxygen and drowning or get crushed depending on where they get caught in the clam,, this is because of the local purposely getting inside the clams for a picture 


5, not a creature but blue capped mushrooms,, highly poisonous to humans, so the bubbleheads one of them, it gets them high, also this is perfectly legal if they're not in designated areas marked off by upper agency,, otherwise they serve them at restaurants and even cook them at home 


4, ticks


The ticks here are the size of tarantulas went empty,, though they can drink about 2 l of blood in one sitting, we have about 5 l of blood 


3, Giant parasitic tardigrades, paragrades


They are about 1.5 to 2 inches long f and can weigh up to 3 g, though they can drink up to 30 g of in one sitting,,




These tardigrades have 12 legs each with very sharp claws, their bodies are translucent which means you can watch them turn red with your, or if they were drinking blood from utopian vertebrates you get to wash them turn purple 

They have a circular formation of sharp teeth, kind of like a ring or a belt but with teeth 

They're not picky about their hosts, once they find a host they will look for the softest spot they can find, 


If your skin is already soft which it most likely is compared to what they feast on normally, it will begin to borrow into your skin like a warm tunneling and an apple, usually half of their bod is buried under your skin

Once they get to this point, do we use that ring of teeth to puncture and anchor itself in your flesh, you can't pull them out otherwise the risk giving up an Oreo cookie-sized chunk of your flesh 

Once they are firmly angered in your flesh, insert a proboscis and throw it around deep inside you until they find a good spot, Cleveland inject anticoagulant and begin to drink blood, and unlike mosquitoes and ticks they don't have the common courtesy to use numbing agents, so you're feeling all this
Don't try to squish the parasitic tardigrades, otherwise they will regurgitate whatever the hell  was in their digestive tract, back into your bloodstream, and you don't want that do you

 also they carry a multitude of diseases so that's sweet

They're most dangerous when they congregate in pits like snake pissing movies, fall into one of these pits and.. imagine the rest it's not pretty



2, fleas,, cricket sized fleas


1, mosquitoes still rain supreme, Except these mosquitoes are about the size of large praying mantises, 

One of the most likely disease they can give you is strawberry fever if you are human, and if you're one of the locals, Violet fever, since the vertices including the bubbleheads have purple blood 

This disease greatly increases your blood pressure, ruptures blood vessels at times, and prevents clotting

 will cause you to sweat blood, cry blood, have massive nosebleeds, have blood in your stool, piss blood, and overall just bleed from every every available hole in your body


It also increases your pain tolerance more than tenfold, but sometimes diminishes your feeling of pain entirely, which sounds good, but with the symptoms you have now,, it just means you are more vulnerable to injury

With the symptoms you already have. The slightest accident accidental cut will be spewing blood all over the place and you will probably bleed to death faster than you would if you didn't get treatment

Redfish on the UL,UltraLightFishing,1fx4tat,2024-10-05 20:50:30,22,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fx4tat,RIP-Lefty,,"Spent the morning fishing at my regular pond. Got a couple spotted trout but the highlight was this baby redfish. The UL made this feel like a marlin. Yellow 1/32 oz jig head with white swimbait. 5‚Äô6‚Äù Okuma celilo UL rod with Okuma Aria 1000 reel. I don‚Äôt remember what the braid test is but the leader is 6#. Once I started bringing in fish this fella wanted me to share some of my earnings. Otherwise, I‚Äôm looking for a replacement for the aria reel as it came as a combo with the rod, but the reel isn‚Äôt the best. It‚Äôs a $17 reel. Thinking about Pfleuger, Diawa, and shimano, but not sure what exact model is the best. I fish a mix of salt and freshwater as you can see. Not sure I‚Äôll ever fish anything other than UL it‚Äôs too fun"

",u_papagayofishingchart,1efrxzo,2024-07-30 08:21:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_papagayofishingchart/comments/1efrxzo/papagayo_fishing_adventure_is_something_that_you/,papagayofishingchart,,"Fishes are amazing living creatures that live in water. They can be found in oceans, rivers, lakes and ponds too. They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. Some are tiny like the little guppy and others are huge like the great white shark. They breathe through their gills which let them take in oxygen from the water. They have fins to help them swim and move around. Most fishes have scales on their bodies that protect them. These scales are shiny and can look very pretty. Papagayo is a beautiful place in Costa Rica and it is known for its great fishing spots. Papagayo fishing charters offer a fun and exciting way to enjoy the ocean.

Fishing charters are the boats that take people out to fish in the ocean. Papagayo fishing charters are run by experienced captains and crews who know the best spots to catch fish. You can catch many different types of fish such as marlin, sailfish, tuna and mahi-mahi too. These fishes are big and can fight strong which makes the experience thrilling. When you go on this journey everything you need is provided with the best charter. The boats have fishing gears like rods, reels and bait. The crew will offer you everything that you need, from setting up your gear to reeling in your catch. They will also teach you fishing techniques and give you tips to catch more fishes.

We NEED a Finding Nemo Realm (FAN CONCEPT),DreamlightValley,1dxwyrv,2024-07-07 21:46:27,16,0.75,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1dxwyrv/we_need_a_finding_nemo_realm_fan_concept/,NightmareFurbies,Fan Concept - NOT OFFICIAL,"I've thought about this over and over and over... and I would LOVE for there to be a Finding Nemo realm!

There'd be 3 characters in this realm (For Free) -- Dory, Marlin, and Nemo.

You'd start with Marlin being in a pond, without Nemo or Dory. 

Marlins beginning questline to get him to your valley would be you searching his realm for Nemo and Dory, doing a few tasks and then promising Marlin that Nemo and Dory might be out in the valley.

Marlin would go into the valley and swim in bodies of water, like how Ariel and Ursula used to. 

Marlin's whole questline would be finding nemo, however, at the end of his Level 10 event, you'd find Dory instead of Nemo and you'd unlock Marlin's ""Plastic Bag"" style where he can roll around on land in a plastic bag so that he's not confined to the ocean.

Dory's whole character questline would be trying to get her memory back from before the forgetting so she can remember where Nemo last was and find him. At the end of her questline, you'd find out that Ursula captured Nemo for god-knows-what, and you rescue him from her. You'd then unlock Dory's ""Plastic Bag"" style, where like Merlin, she can now roll on land.

Nemo's whole character questline would be him reconnecting with Marlin, Dory, and maybe even some of the other villagers before his final quest also unlocks his plastic bag style.

It'd be cute to see these characters in the game and to see them roll around on the island! I'd love it so much as Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movie franchises ever."
I didn't realize the Goldfish was so rare,AnimalCrossing,1dwxzy3,2024-07-06 15:51:24,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1dwxzy3/i_didnt_realize_the_goldfish_was_so_rare/,TheLazyARMY,New Horizons,"I caught:


8 Goliath Beetles

5 Dorados

3 Napoleonfish

3 Coelacanths

2 Cylommatus Stags

2 Blue Marlins

1 Giant Isopod

1 Gigas Clam

And an unbelievable amount of sharks, like oh my gosh so many sharks.

All before I caught a tiny little Goldfish. I made so many ponds looking for that Goldfish üò≠. I haven't put this much energy into finding a critter since looking foe the Goliath Beetle ü§£. I'm not actually sure if the Goldfish is rare but I do know that I've had this current island since May and haven't found one since today sooooo.


That honestly got me thinking. What's a critter that technically isn't rare, but you had a hard time finding?"

Wild antlabs BLTouch standard deviation. Can't create meshes. Here's everything I've tried over a year.

* Herome mount is tight with no wobble
* Bed trammed using a .2 feeler guage.



**Issues**  
I can't create a mesh because of variation in z because the measurements are wildly out. Visualised bed looks like someone threw a rock in a pond.

My bed isn't totally flat and has enough deviation to make inital layers fail.

I always need to adjust Z during the first layer with babysteps (for example M290 Z-0.25).

This lists all drivers with 100 or more starts, their total number of laps completed, and the number of laps that were in the races they ran. From '49-58, there were a number of races where we don't have any information on laps completed: The 20 drivers whose numbers would be affected by these races are denoted with an asterisk. For them, I only counted the laps in the races we have info on.

As stated in the first part, character count limitations forced me to split it into two separate posts.[ For the link to part 1, please click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1cjq2s7/the_currently_98_offenders_executed_by_the_state/)

The currently executed 98 offenders, cases 50 to 98:

**50. Samuel Smith (1979-2001, lethal injection):** In 1979, Smith bound and strangled a physician, 28 year old Zachary Moraitis, to death while robbing his apartment. He was charged and convicted for second degree murder, and given a 12 year sentence for it. 8 years later, a group of inmates, which included 24 year old Marlin May, attacked another inmate. Smith intervened, got into a knife fight with May, and stabbed him to death.

**51. Jerome Mallett (\~1985-2001, lethal injection):** Mallett shot and killed James Froemsdorf, a 35 year old state trooper that pulled him over for speeding, with his own handgun when he tried to arrest him. He fled the scene with a handcuff stuck on his left wrist, which was still on him when Mallett was captured two days later. As a child, Mallett suffered an injury that deformed his right hand, which enabled to slip it out of the cuffs during the botched arrest. At the time of Froemsdorf's murder, Mallett was wanted for robbery and parole violations.

**52. Michael Roberts (1994-2001, lethal injection):** Roberts tricked his neighbor, 56 year old Mary Taylor, into letting him hang out at her house with the intentions of pulling a robbery. They watched television together for several hours until Taylor decided to hush out of the door. He then pounced on her with a hammer he snuck inside, and inflicted 19 blows to her head. Roberts also poured boiling water on Taylor's face, choked her with a telephone cord, and stabbed her with her own butcher knife. A total of $200 and other undisclosed valuables were stolen and most of it was spent on cocaine.

**53. Stephen Johns (1982-2001, lethal injection):** During a gas station robbery, Johns and his accomplices shot and killed the clerk, 17 year old Donald Voepel, and took $248 from the register.

**54. James Johnson (1991-2002, lethal injection):** Johnson got into an argument with his wife and daughter in their home and tried to evict them both at gunpoint. The police were called, and Johnson shot and killed the responding officer, 27 year old Leslie Roark. He drove to the home of another police officer, and fired on his family while they were having a Christmas party. The officer's wife, 38 year old Pam Jones, died in the shooting. Johnson then attacked other policemen in their homes, and fatally shot 54 year old Sheriff Charles Smith in one assault, wounded an officer in another, and gunned down a deputy sheriff, 42 year old Sandra Wilson, when she tried to respond to his rampage. He took a female hostage in a standoff with police, but Johnson released her and surrendered after a day of negotiations.

**55. Michael Owsley (1993-2002, lethal injection):** Owsley and his accomplice double crossed their dealers, 18 year old Elvin Iverson and Ellen Cole (age unknown), during a drug deal and tied them up at gunpoint. The pair beat and strangled their captives in the hope of extorting money from them. Iverson was shot point blank in the head while Cole managed to escape their captors.

**56. Jeffrey Tokar (\~1983-2002, lethal injection):** Tokar and his girlfriend drove into a remote countryside in search of empty houses and farms to rob. The couple picked a farm house owned by 35 year old Johnny Douglass as their target. While they were burglarizing the property, Douglass returned home from an errand with his 8 year old son and 4 year old daughter. The family ran into the couple when they went inside, and Tokar held them at gunpoint. Despite Douglass' daughter pleading for her father's life and Douglass' own pleas, Tokar shot him dead. He had a long history of burglaries, and was released from prison after serving 3 years for burglary just months before the murder. His other previous convictions include DUI and assault.

**57. Paul Kreutzer (1992-2002, lethal injection):** Kreutzer bound and raped 36 year old Louise Hemphill in her own home. Hemphill was stabbed in the neck, beaten with a baseball bat, and strangled to death with a belt. Her purse, along with other incriminating items such as duct tape, bloodied gloves, and a bb gun, was discovered in Kreutzer's possession.

**58. Daniel Basile (1992-2002, lethal injection):** Basile was hired to kill 28 year old Elizabeth DeCaro by her husband, who wanted to collect a life insurance policy. He carried out the murder by shooting Elizabeth dead in her kitchen.

**59. William Jones Jr. (1986-2002, lethal injection):** Jones was dating a much older man, 49 year old Stanley Albert. He shot and killed Albert ""execution style"" in his apartment, wrapped him in a blanket, and dumped his body in a forest. Although Jones claimed that he acted to protect himself from a sexual assault, prosecutors postulated that the murder was motived by his desire to steal Albert's car (which he was captured speeding in).

**60. Kenneth Kenley (\~1984-2003, lethal injection):** In the last of a day long string of robberies, Kenley stormed a tavern and shot a customer, 27 year old Ronnie Felts, dead. He kidnapped the tavern's owner, but she managed to escape from him in the parking lot. Kenley also abducted a woman during a convenience store robbery earlier that day, and sexually assaulted and shot her. She managed to jump out of his car window and survived her injuries. He was released from a 4 year prison sentence for theft just months before his rampage.

**61. John Smith (1997-2003, lethal injection):** Smith stabbed his ex girlfriend, 22 year old Brandie Kearnes, and her stepfather, 51 year old Wayne Hoewing, to death in their home. Kearnes wrote Smith's name in her own blood as she was dying from her injuries.

**62. Stanley Hall (1987-2005, lethal injection):** Hall carjacked 44 year old Barbara Wood to use her car in a planned drive by shooting and tossed her into the Mississippi river from a bridge in front of responding police officers. Years before, Hall shot and wounded a 4 year old girl while trying to kill a man he had been chasing, and had been on parole for that crime at the time of Wood's abduction and murder.

**63. Donald Jones (1993-2005, lethal injection):** Jones walked inside the home of his grandmother, 68 year old Dorothy Knuckles, to beg for money. They got into an argument over his cocaine addiction and alcoholism, and he stabbed her to death with a butcher knife from the kitchen. He then stole an undisclosed amount of money, a VCR set, and her car. Jones used both the money he gained from renting the car and selling the VCR set and the money he stole from Knuckles for cocaine.

**64. Vernon Brown (\~1973-2005, lethal injection):** Brown raped, strangled, and fatally stabbed 19 year old Synetta Ford in her apartment. A year later, he enticed 9 year old Janet Perkins into his home. He then sexually abused and strangled her to death with rope. Brown forced his 11 year old, 9 year old, and 7 year old stepsons to help him dispose of Perkins' body. A lifelong sexual predator, he had a prior conviction of assaulting a 12 year old girl and molested his stepsons. Authorities also suspected that he was involved with the murders of 9 year old Kimberly Campbell and a still unidentified Jane Doe, but he was never charged for them.

**65. Timothy Johnston (1989-2005, lethal injection):** Johnston beat his wife, 27 year old Nancy, with a chair and kicked her to death in front of her 11 year old stepson (from a previous relationship) over his suspicions of her infidelity. According to the stepson, Johnston physically abused her several times in their marriage. He was part of a biker gang and also had charges of burglary and assault pending at the time of the killing. As a side note, Nancy's stepson was living with the couple, as his biological mother went missing and his biological father committed suicide in the boy's presence a year before the murder.

**66. Marlin Gray (1991-2005, lethal injection):** Gray and 3 accomplices kidnapped two sisters, 20 year old Julie and 19 year old Robin Kerry, in front of their 19 year old cousin. The sisters were gang raped together and thrown off a bridge. Their cousin was also tossed off the bridge, but he survived his injuries.

**67. Dennis Skillicorn (1979-2009, lethal injection):** In 1979, Skillicorn and some accomplices shot and killed 81 year old Wendell Howell in his home and stole his television set. He was given a relatively lenient sentence of 35 years for agreeing to testify against the other shooters and was paroled in 1992. A few years after his release, Skillicorn recruited another felon, Allen Nicklasson, and a teenage boy they befriended, and went on another robbery spree. In the process, they fatally shot 31 year old Paul Hines, 47 year old Richard Drummond, 47 year old Joseph Babcock, Joesph's 38 year old wife Charlene, and possibly an unidentified woman in Mexico. The gang found themselves stranded on roads and highways several times due to poor driving, and Drummond and the Babcocks were both abducted and murdered when they tried to help them out.

**68. Martin Link (\~1982-2011, lethal injection):** A chronic sexual predator, Link abducted 11 year old Elissa Self-Braun while she was walking home from school. Self-Braun was raped and strangled to death with a cord. He had several previous convictions of sexual assaults against young girls and grown women between the ages of 13-71, and was caught in a prostitution sting operation. Many of Link's victims testified in the murder trial and partially secured his death sentence.

**69. Joseph Franklin (\~1977-2013, lethal injection):** In a rampage that spanned across several states, Franklin shot 15 to 20 victims between the ages of 13-45 in mostly sniper attacks, and firebombed a synagogue. Most of his victims were killed, but a few such as pornographer Larry Flynt (36 years old at the time of the shooting) and and Civil Rights attorney Vernon Jordan (45 years old at the time of the shooting) survived their injuries. Franklin was a white supremacist, and mostly targeted Blacks, Jews, civil rights activists, and interracial couples.

**70. Allen Nicklasson (\~1980s-2013, lethal injection):** Nicklasson assisted the above mentioned Dennis Skillicorn in the robbery murders of Paul Hines, Richard Drummond, Joseph and Charlene Babcock. He had a history of petty crimes starting as a child, but my sources were scant on the details.

**71. Herbert Smulls (\~1994-2014, lethal injection):** While robbing a jewelry store with an accomplice, Smulls shot and killed the owner, 57 year old Stephen Honickman, and stole some jewelry. He had 11 previous convictions of robbery and theft, and was tied to another robbery committed in similar circumstances.

**72. Michael Taylor (1989-2014, lethal injection):** Taylor and Roderick Nunley kidnapped 15 year old Ann Harrison while she was waiting for a school bus. They dragged her inside their car and drove Harrison to the home owned by Nunley's mother. She was gang-raped by the pair in the house's garage and stabbed to death.

**73. Jeffrey Ferguson (1988-2014, lethal injection):** Ferguson and an accomplice snatched 17 year old Kelli Hall from a service station she worked at. She was taken to a barn, where she was raped and strangled to death. Hall's body was dumped on the property. Ferguson had an assault conviction that pertained to an incident of him shooting and injuring a friend in a dispute over a woman. That same woman also claimed that Ferguson sexually assaulted and physically abused her numerous times while they lived together.

**74. William Rousan (1993-2014, lethal injection):** Rousan, his teenage son, and his brother attacked a farm owned by a married couple, 67 year old Charles and 62 year old Grace Lewis. Under his orders, Rousan's son shot and killed both of the Lewis'. The Rousans stole the couple's truck, a VCR set, two cows, jewelry, and a saddle in the robbery.

**75. John Winfield (1996-2014, lethal injection):** Winfield was enraged that his ex girlfriend started dating another man and confronted her about it at her apartment. Two friends of her, 23 year old Shawnee Murphy and 20 year old Arthea Sanders, were also present with them. In a fit of anger, Winfield shot all three of the women multiple times each. Murphy and Sanders died at the scene, while the ex girlfriend survived with severe facial disfigurements and was permanently blinded.

**76. John Middleton (\~1990s-2014, lethal injection):** Middleton was a meth dealer whose operations had been increasingly compromised by police raids. In an attempt to root out the potential informants, he armed himself with an SKS rifle, and shot and killed three of his associates, 39 year old Randy Hamilton, 29 year old Alfred Pinegar, and 21 year old Stacey Hodge. He disposed of the bodies with the help of his girlfriend. A rival meth dealer had also accused Middleton of raping and beating his girlfriend to death with a baseball bat, but he wasn't prosecuted for that crime.

**77. Michael Worthington (1995-2014, lethal injection):** Worthington cut through the window screen of a neighboring condo, and sexually assaulted the tenant, 24 year old Melinda Griffin. He strangled her to death with a cord and his bare hands when she tried to fight back. Griffin's car, jewelry, and credit cards were stolen by Worthington, and he used the card to buy drugs.

**78. Earl Ringo Jr. (1998-2014, lethal injection):** Ringo and his accomplice ambushed a delivery driver, 45 year old Dennis Poyser, and a manager trainee, 22 year old JoAnna Baysinger, as they were walking into a Ruby Tuesday restaurant. He shot and killed Poyser upon entry, and forced Baysinger to pull out $1,400 from the restaurant's safe. Despite her compliance, Ringo shot Baysinger in the head.

**79. Leon Taylor (\~1975-2014, lethal injection):** In 1975, Taylor and some accomplices fatally stabbed 62 year old Jesse Howartzer while burglarizing his apartment. He was given a second degree murder conviction and was released sometime before the 1990s. In 1994, Taylor and his half siblings forced a gas station attendant, 53 year old Robert Newton, to pull out $400 from the register and shot him dead. Newton's 8 year old stepdaughter was also present to keep him company, and Taylor moved to kill her as well. The girl's life was only spared when his gun jammed. After the robbery, he expressed his regrets of not ""choking the little bitch"" to his siblings.

**80. Paul Goodwin (1998-2014, lethal injection):** Goodwin was removed from a boarding home, and he blamed his neighbor, 63 year old Joan Crotts, for it. His habit of harassment towards her intensified, and he repeatedly shouted vulgarities and threats on her front porch, tossed beer bottles and eggs at her lawn and house, and fed her dog chicken bones. It escalated to the breaking point when Crotts invited Goodwin inside her home in an attempt to have the issue peacefully resolved. Goodwin instead forced Crotts to perform oral sex on him and bludgeoned her to death with a hammer. His execution was controversial, as Goodwin allegedly had a cognitive disability.

**81. Walter Storey (1990-2015, lethal injection):** Storey climbed up the balcony of his apartment complex, and entered a neighboring flat. He stabbed the tenant, 36 year old Jill Frey, 12 times with his kitchen knife and broke 6 of her ribs in a beating. Frey's pocketbook, keys, and car were stolen in the robbery.

**82. Cecil Clayton (1996-2015, lethal injection)**: Clayton got into an altercation with his estranged girlfriend at a store, and shoved her a number of times. The employees notified the police, and a few officers were sent to the scene. They spoke with Clayton and he agreed to return to his home while the police escorted the shaken girlfriend back to hers. In the following night, Clayton tried to break into her house, and she called the police. One of the dispatched officers, 29 year old Christopher Castetter, was shot dead in the ensuring confrontation.

**83. Andre Cole (1998-2015, lethal injection):** Cole broke a window and entered the home of his ex wife to confront her about debts relating to child support payments for their two children. His ex wife's boyfriend, 38 year old Anthony Curtis, tried to usher him out the door, but was stabbed to death for his troubles. Cole also attacked his ex wife, but she survived her injuries.

**84. Richard Strong (\~1999-2015, lethal injection):** Strong fatally stabbed his girlfriend, 23 year old Eva Washington and her 2 year old daughter, Zandrea Thomas, in their apartment. Both of the bodies were mutilated almost beyond recognition. He had assaulted Washington numerous times in their relationship. Many of the episodes were taken to the courts. One choking incident required him to be in anger management classes and Washington pushed a restraining order that she later withdrew in another.

**85. David Zink (\~1980s-2015):** Zink kidnapped 19 year old Amanda Morton after ramming her car with his own on the freeway. He bound Morton to a cemetery tree and raped her. She was beaten to death, and her body was found with over 100 blunt trauma related injuries. Zink had just been released after serving 20 out of a 33 year sentence for sexual assault at the time of the abduction and murder.

**86. Roderick Nunley (1989-2015, lethal injection):** As mentioned under Michael Taylor's section, Nunley partook in the abduction, rape, and murder of Ann Harrison.

**87. Earl Forrest II (2002-2015, lethal injection):** Forrest was in the home of 51 year old Harriet Smith trying to negotiate a deal involving her buying him a lawn mower and a trailer in exchange for a source of meth. An argument broke out, and Forrest fatally shot Smith and her housemate, 41 year old Michael Wells. He stole $25,000 worth of meth and fled to his home. A squad of responding police officers confronted him there and Forrest opened fire on them. Sharon Barnes, a 48 year old deputy, was killed, and Sheriff Bob Wofford and Forrest's girlfriend Angela Gamblin were wounded by him in the exchange.

**88. Mark Christeson (1998-2017, lethal injection)**: Christeson and his cousin abducted 37 year old Susan Brouk, and her two children, 12 year old Adrian and 9 year old Kyle, from their home at gunpoint. The pair raped Susan, slashed her throat, and drowned her and her children together in a pond. Several items such as the family's shotguns, television set, VCR, car stereo, video game controller, and checkbooks were stolen from the home, and sold for money to sustain themselves as fugitives.

**89. Russell Bucklew (1996-2019, lethal injection):** Bucklew was infuriated that his ex girlfriend, Stephanie Ray, broke off their relationship and started dating 27 year old Michael Sanders. He began by beating Ray in her trailer, cut her jaw with a knife, and threatened to kill her if she stepped foot in Sanders' trailer. The attack had the opposite effect of its' objective, and instead terrified Ray to the point of moving in with Sanders for protection. Weeks later, Bucklew ""borrowed"" his brothers' handcuffs and guns, and stormed Sanders' trailer. He shot and killed Sanders, shot at his 6 year old son, and kidnapped Ray. Bucklew bound her with the handcuffs, dragged her into his car, and raped her. She was rescued by police officers, who wounded and subduded Bucklew in a shootout. However, Bucklew briefly escaped, and attacked Ray's mother and her boyfriend with a hammer before he was recaptured. His execution was contested, as Bucklew allegedly had a medical condition that would've made the lethal injection ""inhumane.""

**90. Walter Barton (1991-2020, lethal injection):** Barton was condemned for the fatal attack on his landlady, 81 year old Gladys Kuehler in her trailer. She was raped and stabbed over 50 times. A page from Kuehler's checkbook was taken, which was used to transfer $50 to Barton's account. Blood found on his clothes were also linked to Kuehler by a DNA test. Kuehler and Barton were reportedly close and many accounts report that he assisted her in walking and did chores around her home. However, she had him evicted due to falling far behind on rent days before the murder. Barton, his attorneys, and supporters in Missouri‚Äôs Innocence Project pushed that the blood on his clothes was from posthumous contact with Kuehler‚Äôs body while allegedly discovering it. From such concerns, his execution was a source of controversy.

**91. Ernest Johnson (\~1990s-2020, lethal injection):** Johnson held a retail store at gunpoint. In retaliation for the employees destroying the safe key, Johnson shot 3 employees, 58 year old Fred Jones, 57 year old Mable Scruggs, and 46 year old Mary Bratcher. When the victims survived the initial shootings, he beat and stabbed them to death with a hammer and a screwdriver. He had previous convictions of robbery and burglary, and was released from prison a year before the murders. His execution was contested, as Johnson had brain surgery to remove a tumor in 2014. According to his attorneys, the operation rendered him cognitively disabled, and therefore was ineligible for execution.

**92. Carman Deck (1996-2022, lethal injection):** Deck, his sister, and their mother's boyfriend invaded the home of a couple, 69 year old James and 67 year old Zelma Long. They shot and killed the Longs, and stole jewelry, checks, and a total of $200 from the house.

**93. Kevin Johnson Jr. (\~2000s-2022, lethal injection)**: Johnson was heavily involved with robberies and other crimes as a teenager, and spent much of his time in and out of prison. In 2005, local law enforcement suspected Johnson of violating the terms of his probation, and raided his family home. His 12 year old brother died of a seizure during the search, and Johnson and the family blamed the officers involved. He hunted down one of the officers, 43 year old William McEntee, and shot and killed him while he was on patrol.

**94. Scott/Amber McLaughlin (\~1992-2023, lethal injection):** McLaughlin abducted their girlfriend, 45 year old Beverly Guenther, from her office as she was getting off from a shift. They raped and stabbed Guenther to death, and dumped her body in a neighborhood. Guenther‚Äôs family recounted that McLaughlin was extremely abusive during their relationship, and harassed Guenther when she left them. The harassment included several incidents of burglarizing Guenther‚Äôs home. McLaughlin was also a registered sex offender with a conviction of molesting a 14 year old girl. They received national attention for being the first known transsexual to be executed in the United States. Biologically male during their offenses and transitioned to female on death row.

**95. Leonard Taylor (2004-2023, lethal injection):** Taylor shot and killed his girlfriend, 28 year old Angela Rowe, and her 3 children, 10 year old Alexus, 6 year old AcQreya, and 5 year old Tyrese, in their home. He had several unrelated sexual offenses against a former stepdaughter and other unidentified women, and was involved with drug trafficking. Despite his history and the other damning evidence against him (including testimony of his brother mentioning that he confided about committing the murder and traces of Angela's blood being found on his glasses), Taylor was popular among Missouri Innocence Project organizations for his daughter's alleged claims of him calling her 2,000 miles away from the crime scene.

**96. Michael Tisius (2000-2023, lethal injection):** In an attempt to break a friend out of a rural jail, Tisus shot and killed two guards, 33 year old Leon Egley and 36 year old Jason Acton. However, he was driven away by police reinforcements, and forced to flee the jail emptyhanded with his accomplice, the friend's girlfriend. They were captured in Kansas when their car broke down. Tisus was previously held in the targeted jail for an unspecified misdemeanor, and became acquainted with his friend while they were cellmates.

**97.Johnny Johnson (2004-2023, lethal injection):** Johnson was sleeping over at a friend's house where 6 year old Cassandra Williamson was also staying with her father. In the middle of the night, Johnson lured Williamson into an abandoned factory, and raped her. When she tried to fight back, he crushed her skull with a brick. At the time of the murder, Johnson was a transient with a criminal history, but I couldn't find any specifics regarding his past convictions. Johnson's execution was a source of controversy, as he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.

**98.Brian Dorsey (\~2006-2024, lethal injection):** Dorsey was on the run from a drug related debt to his dealers and retreated to his cousin, 25 year old Sarah Bonnie, and her husband, 28 year old Benjamin, for sanctuary. In their home, he shot the couple dead in front of their 4 year old daughter and performed acts of necrophila on Sarah's body."

Sexy Steampunk Babes: Chapter Twenty Four,HFY,1cdwq4y,2024-04-26 17:11:05,1813,0.98,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1cdwq4y/sexy_steampunk_babes_chapter_twenty_four/,BlueFishcake,OC," 

William struggled not to wince as the door to his alchemical storage room slowly cracked partially open.

‚ÄúGoddesses‚Äô mercy,‚Äù Marline hissed from behind him. ‚ÄúHow is it worse the second time?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause we added a few things the last time we were here?‚Äù William said as he unhooked the tripwire attached to the door before pulling it fully open.

‚ÄúThe potatoes are what‚Äôs making that smell!?‚Äù Marline hissed as she stepped inside.

‚ÄúYep. Never underestimate the power of potatoes and a few warm summer days. Plus there‚Äôs a few other things in here,‚Äù William tried not to breathe through his nose as he closed the door behind him after stepping inside himself. ‚ÄúLight. One charge. Instant activation. Right hand.‚Äù

At his words, the room lit up as his right hand started to glow with an ethereal light. One that revealed‚Ä¶ three barrels and a crate.

Glancing over, he noticed Marline staring at his hand.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked.

The dark elf shrugged. ‚ÄúJust seems a bit wasteful is all. Day‚Äôs not over yet and now you‚Äôre down a spell charge.‚Äù

William shrugged. ‚ÄúBetter that than bringing a candle in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

William‚Äôs gaze flicked over to a nearby ‚Äì sealed ‚Äì barrel. ‚ÄúJust take my word for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not ominous at all,‚Äù the girl muttered as she walked over to the nearby crate.

William smirked as he followed after her. She didn‚Äôt know the half of it.

Which was probably for the best. Given how she‚Äôd responded to the whole ‚ÄòAl‚Äôhundra situation‚Äô he doubted she‚Äôd take well to learning that the entire room could *theoretically* go up if an errant spark happened to get inside one of the nearby barrels.

Admittedly, a single candle was unlikely to achieve that, given the barrels had lids on them, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Given just how dangerous just opening the door to this room could be given the booby trap on the door, he felt it was perfectly reasonable to err on the side of caution by not adding any more danger to what was already a fairly volatile environment.

*On the bright side, if I ever do fuck opening the door up, I probably won‚Äôt have more than half a second to regret it,* he thought.

So no, he didn‚Äôt feel even a smidgen of regret in making use of a precious spell slot to light the way while they were in here.

Fishing a second key out of his shirt, he ignored his companion‚Äôs gags as he unlocked the chest to reveal the collection of mouldy looking vegetables within. Squishing his discomfort, he reached through it to unhook the crate‚Äôs false bottom.

Admittedly, said false bottom wasn‚Äôt particularly good given that it was trying to mask a space large enough to fit two orbs the size of bowling balls ‚Äì that glowed ‚Äì but that was fine. It was simply the last line of defence. One that would only come into play in the event some ne‚Äôer-do-well chose to break into an alchemical storage room, get past his booby trap, fail to ignite the contents of the barrels by looking into them, before finally digging through a crate full of rotten potatoes.

Mostly it was there to keep the glow of the orbs from being spotted while they sat at the bottom of the pile.

‚ÄúLike I told you, safe and sound.‚Äù William said as he pulled out one of the mithril cores before tossing it to Marline.

‚ÄúUgh!‚Äù The girl yelped as she caught the thing. ‚ÄúI wish you wouldn‚Äôt do that!‚Äù

He smirked, resisting the urge to point out that the orb she was holding had spent about a decade at the bottom of the ocean being used as a scratching post by a ship-sized squid before they recovered it. A little rough handling wasn‚Äôt about to damage it.

No, that would require specialized tools of the kind that could only be found in a shard-workshop.

‚ÄúAre your folks ready to collect yet?‚Äù he asked, gesturing to the second orb.

Marline‚Äôs scowl turned into a pensive expression as she shook her head. ‚ÄúNot yet. When we spoke, she implied she‚Äôd be sending my aunts to collect it in person, but I‚Äôve not heard anything since.‚Äù

William nodded. That wasn‚Äôt too unexpected. What was, was that Marline had apparently chosen to communicate her ‚Äòacquisition of a mithril core‚Äô over orb.‚Äù

 Unless‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou spoke in code, right?‚Äù

Given the silver color of her iris, it wasn‚Äôt hard to miss the way his teammate rolled her eyes at his question. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

The ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not an idiot‚Äô went unspoken. Because while no one was foolish enough to state aloud that the Crown monitored Orb communications, it was common knowledge that they did.

And while the law around ‚Äòscavenged cores‚Äô was explicit enough that William nor Marline had any reason to fear censure for how they‚Äôd acquired their cores, the Crown would definitely have questions.

Questions William ‚Äì and by extension, Marline ‚Äì had no interest in answering for a little longer yet.

‚ÄúOut of curiosity, what‚Äôs the cover story for your aunts coming to visit?‚Äù he asked.

Marline chuckled lowly. ‚ÄúApparently I‚Äôm madly in love with a boy on my team.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù he asked, trying not to laugh.

Once more, the dark elf rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYep. And given just how out of character thoughts of romance of any kind would be for me, you could say it caught my mother‚Äôs attention. Enough that it wasn‚Äôt hard to clue her in on everything else while still speaking in code.‚Äù

Yeah, William could see the dark elf‚Äôs mother being surprised by her daughter‚Äôs sudden infatuation with a boy. Never mind the fact that he was very publicly betrothed to a very powerful family, he was also pretty certain Marline was gay.

Oh, she‚Äôd hidden it well enough, but over the last few months he‚Äôd managed to catch her gaze lingering just a little longer than strictly necessary here or there. Not on him. Never on him.

But on the other members of the team to be sure.

Honestly, in retrospect he actually felt a little foolish for not figuring it out sooner.

It neatly explained her discomfort at being forced to share his bed for the geass, as well as her general antipathy towards him when they‚Äôd met. Even her refusal to shower with the team could be explained away as some kind of‚Ä¶ outmoded idea of chivalry on her part.

And as much as he hated to give any legitimacy to the idea of the ‚Äòman hating lesbian trope‚Äô, the fact was, there did exist people who preferred the same sex who also tended to have little patience for the opposite sex.

It was an over inflated stereotype, but it did exist.

With that in mind, he was actually happy that Marline had so quickly managed to overcome her internal misandrist mindset after meeting him.

*Actually, with that in mind, perhaps it was more a result of lack of exposure to men than anything else?*

In his experience, that tended to be the root cause of most kinds of bigotry. A lack of experience and understanding combined with some other factor.

So yes, if Marline‚Äôs mother knew of her daughter‚Äôs ‚Äì likely hidden - orientation, she‚Äôd definitely start to pay attention if said daughter developed an interest in a man.

Again, an engaged man.

To a family powerful enough to crush the diminished Greygrass Household without so much as breaking stride.

‚ÄúDoes she‚Ä¶ believe you? That you have a core?‚Äù he asked.

It certainly didn‚Äôt sound believable. Hell, he‚Äôd needed to swear a geass with Marline before she‚Äôd come around to believing he could acquire one. And even then he was certain she‚Äôd held doubts.

‚ÄúWho knows?‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúWe certainly couldn‚Äôt talk freely. Still, she knows I‚Äôm not the kind for idle flights of fancy, even if our conversation implied as much to any third parties that might be listening.‚Äù 

Her hands slid over across the smooth glowing surface of the core she was holding. ‚ÄúTo that end, in addition to sending my aunts to meet the man I was apparently so interested in, she also said she‚Äôd be ‚Äògetting the house ready‚Äô, in the event you wanted to visit our estate.‚Äù

In other words, they‚Äôd be getting the ship ready to accept a core.

The dark elf‚Äôs expression turned ruthful. ‚ÄúThough make no mistake. She will want to thank you at some point. Needs to, even, given the service you‚Äôve done for us.‚Äù

William was about to say something, but his teammate cut him off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. What you‚Äôve done for us‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs beyond words. And I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôve not been as vocal in my thanks as I could have been. Especially for a boon of this size.‚Äù

William shrugged. ‚ÄúWe had a deal.‚Äù

She laughed. ‚ÄúI think we both know that you didn‚Äôt actually need me that night. You could easily have accomplished it all yourself.‚Äù

Perhaps, but it would have been riskier than it might have been otherwise. The boat might have drifted or his decompression spell might have failed, leaving him to surface fully suffering from the bends.

Admittedly, the latter was something he might have been able to work around by controlling his ascent speed, but given just how fast a curious kraken might have been encroaching on the deceased Al‚ÄôHundra‚Äôs territory, time had been of the essence.

No, Marline‚Äôs presence had ultimately been superfluous, but that‚Äôs true for most redundancies.

They were useless right up until they weren‚Äôt.

‚Ä¶Still, he knew just looking at Marline that she wasn‚Äôt about to accept that.

As far as she was concerned he‚Äôd done her and her family an incredible favour while asking for little to nothing in return.

‚ÄúTo that end, while I may not be our House Matriarch, I know in my heart that I speak for her now, so listen to me when I say that whatever you need, the House of Greygrass is in your debt. From now until the time our children‚Äôs children take their last breath in this world, our swords are yours,‚Äù she said solemnly.

Part of him wanted to dismiss her words out of hand. To say she owed him nothing beyond her friendship. But that was the old him. The one who‚Äôd been born in a different world under different stars.

The him of here and now was different.

‚ÄúI accept,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd though it pains my heart to do so, I will tell you now that I‚Äôll likely have to hold you to that oath before long.‚Äù

The dark elf grinned, white teeth glinting in the gloom of the old storage room ‚Äì as peculiar a place for such a solemn declaration as any William could think of.

‚ÄúI never would have guessed,‚Äù she snarked as her eyes flitted toward the barrels behind him and the nearby crate.

William rolled his eyes as he conceded the point. Marline, more than most, had seen enough of his secrets to guess that his future plans weren‚Äôt likely to stop at just breaking off an unwanted betrothal.

*Even if doing so* **without sparking off a civil war** *is probably the single most complicated part of my immediate ambitions,* he thought.

Because it *was* a difficult problem.

Were this all just about breaking off his upcoming engagement, it would be too easy. All he‚Äôd have to do was provide the Crown with something valuable enough for them to consider war with the Blackstones worth the cost of securing it.

*A few mithril cores would probably do it,* he thought. *I wouldn‚Äôt even have to part with any of my tech.*

And they‚Äôd go for it. They couldn't afford not to, given that the alternative would mean those cores would end up in the hands of their political enemies.

The problem was that the current administration would probably lose that fight ‚Äì even without the duchy of Summerfield switching sides.

*Though I suppose they could just kill me and take said cores on the sly,* he thought.

That would actually be a pretty neat solution to the problem if the Crown could get away with it.

The problem was that then he‚Äôd be dead ‚Äì and he had far too much he still needed to get done before he allowed himself to die now.

So instead he had to take a different route and tackle a much more difficult problem.

‚Ä¶The problem of making an entire duchy back down from their chance at ascendancy, without so much as a single shot being fired or a drop of blood being spilled.

*At least outside of a practice arena,* he thought grimly.

All while his family tried to stab him in the back‚Ä¶ oh, and without him giving away too much of the technology locked away inside his brain.

Because that‚Äôd start off a civil war just as surely as the crown interfering in his upcoming nuptials. The possibility of either side gaining too large an advantage would start off a conflict just as surely as him walking up to Tala and shooting her in the face ‚Äì as the the side that didn‚Äôt receive said technology would move to attack before said tech could become widespread enough that the the tides turned against them.

It was an awful tangled mess.

With all that in mind, was it any wonder that his plans to do just that felt more like walking a tightrope over a pond of hungry piranha than anything even remotely approaching sanity?

‚ÄúYou ok?‚Äù Marline asked gently.

‚ÄúJust thinking about how much of a pain in the ass the next few‚Ä¶ decades are likely to be,‚Äù William muttered, mostly to himself.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù the dark elf chuckled. ‚ÄúReally making me feel great about the fact that my family is now tied to you for the foreseeable future.‚Äù

It was actually rather touching that despite saying the words, he didn‚Äôt hear even a hint of regret in her tone.

She‚Äôd meant what she said. Truly. Deeply. And he didn‚Äôt doubt her family would be the same.

‚ÄúIs your skyship flight capable?‚Äù he asked, changing the subject.

To his relief, the dark elf accepted it without issue. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll need a little work, but nothing more than a metaphorical spring clean. Something our people will have done before my aunts arrive.‚Äù

That made sense. Even if it didn‚Äôt have a mithril core, the hull of a skyship was still a massive investment of money, time and resources. If it was seen to be rusting or falling into disrepair, the Greygrass‚Äôs ran the risk of either the Crown or a ducal family claiming the ship ‚Äòfor the good of the realm‚Äô.

Oh, said parties would pay Marline‚Äôs family for it, but William doubted it would be a particularly good deal.

Though it did make him wonder just how many skyship hulls were sitting dormant in warehouses across the kingdom? He couldn‚Äôt imagine too many given the sheer cost of maintaining turning them into little more than a money-sink, but he had to imagine there were at least a few more families like Marline‚Äôs who were desperately paying said costs in hopes of reclaiming their former noble status.

Other than that, he imagined the Crown might have one or two hulls in storage, ready to be put back into service in the event of a new mithril core discovery.

‚ÄúDo you think they‚Äôll have any trouble getting here and extracting the core unseen?‚Äù he asked.

Otherwise they ran the risk of being intercepted by ‚Äòbandits‚Äô if it was known they were carrying an unprotected core.

Because anything less than being surrounded by a few thousand tons of ship-grade warship armour was considered ‚Äòunprotected‚Äô in this world.

‚ÄúAs things are now, definitely.‚Äù Marline said, before gesturing to the orb in his hands. ‚ÄúAfter you unveil this thing to all and sundry? Less so.‚Äù

She eyed him. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt take a genius to connect you unveiling a previously unknown mithril core and Al‚ÄôHundra washing up a few weeks ago. The ‚Äòhow‚Äô will definitely have them scratching their heads, but the connection will remain.‚Äù

Oh, William didn‚Äôt doubt it. Just as he knew he‚Äôd be fending off some awkward questions in the next few days.

Fortunately, the fact that he‚Äôd be in the public spotlight would keep any parties from just dragging him off into a backroom to pry said answers out of him with a set of pliers.

Neither the Blackstones or the Crown could make that kind of move without being blocked by the other.

After the duel though‚Ä¶ well, he‚Äôd deal with that problem when he got to it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance you could delay this for a few more days?‚Äù Marline asked plaintively. ‚ÄúAt least until my aunts arrived.‚Äù

He winced. ‚ÄúWould that I could. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt run the risk. Griffith got back to me a few hours ago about my spell-bolt being tentatively approved for use on the Floats.‚Äù

The rubber bullets he‚Äôd shown off had tipped things in his favour for now.

Unfortunately, the moment he‚Äôd handed said weapon over for testing, a countdown on how long it would be until the Blackstones were made aware of it began.

If he wanted his little trick to remain a surprise for the upcoming bout ‚Äì a bout he needed every advantage he could get in ‚Äì he needed to kick off the duel as soon as possible.

He explained as much before continuing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also worried about my mother throwing more wrenches into the works.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúIf this is going to happen, it needs to happen now.‚Äù

Marline frowned, before nodding understandably. ‚ÄúIf you say so. We‚Äôll just have to hope that my aunts arrive soon and they leave before too many people draw a connection between you and Al‚ÄôHunda, and them arriving and going.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúWith any luck, your little ‚Äòromantic liaison‚Äô smokescreen will throw things off.‚Äù

She nodded, though it wasn‚Äôt particularly enthusiastic. Still, Marline‚Äôs aunts were veterans, and if they were anything like the girl herself, they‚Äôd be *very* capable.

‚Ä¶Even if technically they‚Äôd been part of the generation that had lost the previous mithril core.

He shook his head. He had little doubt they‚Äôd spent the last twenty years preparing to make up for that failure.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúWhat will be will be.‚Äù

She *delicately* passed the mithril core back to him, though he was amused to see her almost physical reluctance to do so.

She sighed. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go see your fianc√©e and get ready to lose this thing on an incredibly stupid bet.‚Äù

He smiled, patting her on the shoulder as he walked past.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit!‚Äù

\---------------------------------

The dining hall was never quiet around dinner time.

Unlike breakfast and lunch, which was eaten as quickly as the average cadet could shovel it into their mouths, the evening meal was a much more relaxed affair. One that allowed cadets to unwind a little after a long day.

It even came with dessert options.

Certainly, there was still an evening inspection yet to come, along with a myriad other chores that the average cadet needed to get done, but ultimately dinner represented the end of the service day.

So it was that William wasn‚Äôt too surprised by the veritable wall of noise that slammed into him as he stepped into the massive room, long tables filled with cadets of all sorts chattering loudly away to each other.

Naturally, it was strictly divided by colour, with each house sticking to their own. From there it was divided by year group.

The only exceptions being a small back table occupied by a small smattering of instructors whose role it was to ensure that some small smattering of discipline was maintained, if only by dint of them being present.

William was pretty sure said duty took place on a rotation, as he knew for a fact that the rest of the staff ate elsewhere, though he‚Äôd naturally never had reason to enter the staff cafeteria.

Still, all that noise fell away remarkably quickly as he stepped into the room. In clumps at first, but it spread like a wildfire as people noticed their neighbours falling silent and turned to see what had caused it. In turn, others looked up as the ambient noise of the room fell away.

In moments, the final voice was silent as the last few cadets finished what they were saying and looked up to see William standing there, his team around him.

But they weren‚Äôt looking at him.

They were looking at what he was holding.

A Mithril Core.

And as generally unflappable as William liked to consider himself, he could resist the small animal part of his brain that tried to squawk in panic as he beheld the myriad emotions flashing across the faces that were all now staring in his direction.

Disbelief. Shock. Greed. Lust. Amusement. Curiosity. Anger.

Even the Instructors were no exception, as they seemed stunned in place by what he‚Äôd just walked into the room with.

He could all-but feel his team shuffling uncomfortably behind him.

But just as all eyes were on him, he had eyes for only one person present. Ignoring all of them, he strode through the aisles of tables towards the end of the room where the third years sat.

His target hadn‚Äôt been hard to find, despite the myriad similarly dressed people around her.

Because the crowd was positioned around her. She was not within the crowd.

It was a subtle difference to see, but it existed.

Tala Blackstone of House Blackstone sat at the head of the Blackstone table in pride of place. A position even more vaunted in some ways than that of an Instructor.

Certainly Willaim didn‚Äôt doubt that in many ways the Instructors of House Blackstone did actually answer to the heir. Especially now, in her third year. But one from graduation.

‚ÄúTala,‚Äù he said as he came to stop in front of her table, his voice all but echoing in the silence.

Credit where credit was due, the expression of surprise on his fianc√©es face had faded before he even reached the table. Now it looked studiously blank as she gazed into his eyes.

‚ÄúWilliam,‚Äù her voice was as hard as iron. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What do you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

He actually smiled at that, not least of all because he had genuinely no idea how to answer her question.

At least, not in a manner that would satisfy the girl.

Because it was a question that could have so many meanings.

Still, he had but one answer.

‚ÄúChallenging you, my dear fianc√©e. To a duel.‚Äù His grin only grew as her eyebrow quirked inquisitively. ‚ÄúTomorrow. On the Floats. With the rising of the sun. I, William Ashfield challenge you, Tala Blackstone to a team duel. For my right to break off our betrothal once and for all.‚Äù

He saw the flicker of realization in her eyes as she heard his words and her gaze flickered down to the core in his hands. But there was nothing she could do as he continued.

‚ÄúYou needed to go this far?‚Äù she asked quietly, though it carried quite far across the cafeteria.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI did. I am well aware of how often my lamentations about our upcoming nuptials seem as nothing to your ears.‚Äù He raised the orb up in one hand. ‚ÄúSo this time I have brought something that might make them more receptive to my words.‚Äù

He glanced around. ‚ÄúAnd I also made sure to pick a suitably‚Ä¶ impactful venue for my throwing of the gauntlet.‚Äù

He could tell she wanted to know where he‚Äôd gotten the core. How he‚Äôd gotten it. Because the notion that he had one strained belief.

But he did have one and anyone with even a hint of magical ability could sense it as he channelled just a hint of his aether into the device ‚Äì which in turn started to churn out masses of blue green smoke.

More than any mage could produce, for if the average mage‚Äôs raw aether output was akin to a kitchen tap, then a mithril core‚Äôs was a roaring river.

Not the kind of thing that could be faked as a veritable stream of lighter than air smoke flew up into the air to waft around the rafters before filtering through the open windows outside.

That, more than anything else, was proof that what he was holding was real.

‚ÄúWell, you have my attention,‚Äù she said through gritted teeth.

‚ÄúGood, because I wager this core entirely and without reservation, my peers as witness.‚Äù

He luxuriated in the horrified gasps that spread through the room at his words as he soldier on.

‚ÄúA mithril core for a mere chance to escape the stigma of being tied to a family of slavers. Because I‚Äôll have no part of it. Not now. Not ever. So, one match. Your team against mine. On the Floats. With our ancestors and the gods themselves as witness.‚Äù

As well as half the kingdom, because the viewing orbs would definitely be booked to capacity for a scandal of this size. Even at such short notice, the news would spread and no one would want to miss this match.

It was like something out of a story book, after all.

All that was missing was finding out that he‚Äôd been supplied the core by his ‚Äòreal true love‚Äô.

Still, storybook setup or not, he could see others around him smirking or wincing at his words.

Because to them it didn‚Äôt sound like a match. It sounded like an execution.

A team of first years going up against a third year team wasn‚Äôt a match. It was a slaughter.

Which was why Tala was stuck.

She didn‚Äôt want to accept. He could see it. Sure, she wanted the mithril core ‚Äì who wouldn‚Äôt? - but not so much as to jeopardize her family‚Äôs alliance with his.

Because a single core was not worth risking losing access to the combined might of the Summerfield dukedom.

‚Ä¶The problem was that no one but her knew that.

All they saw was a moronic young male from a tiny countship practically serving up a core on a silver platter to her. All she had to do was risk losing a fairly unappealing betrothal. Hell, even if she won, no one would bat an eye if she broke off the betrothal anyway after a stunt like this, taking the core and moving onto a more compliant and appealing match.

No, there was no way for her to refuse this duel. Not without being labelled a coward of the highest order.

A death sentence at her level of politics.

He saw the rage in her eyes as she reached that realization.

‚ÄúI accept, William Ashfield. And know that for all that I will enjoy acquiring another core for the House of Blackstone, that enjoyment will pale in comparison to the joy I will receive from heaping upon you a much needed dose of reality.‚Äù

William just grinned, even as the Instructors finally managed to shake off the shock that had overcome them and started marching as one towards him and his team.

‚ÄúI look forward to it, Tala. From the bottom of my heart.‚Äù

If only because this entire farce would finally be over with‚Ä¶

He had much more important things to do than indulge in childish schoolyard squabbles after all.

*No matter how difficult they may well turn out to be,* he thought grimly.

Because the dice had now been rolled and he was far from certain as to whether they‚Äôd land in his favor.

**SOME FUN FACTS:**

If this format was used across other major motorsports, Juan Pablo Montoya would have a championship in NASCAR Cup, Indycar, and F1.

If Greg Biffle won in 2005, he would have a championship across all three top divisions in NASCAR, making him the first driver in history to do so.

Neil Castles, Cecil Gordon, Richard Childress, and Joe Millikan would be winless champions.

Chase Elliott would be the new youngest champion at about 21 years old."

Cinema MVPs: The Best Film for every Baseball Team,baseball,1947mmg,2024-01-11 12:46:19,27,0.81,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1947mmg/cinema_mvps_the_best_film_for_every_baseball_team/,sillydilly4lyfe,Opinion,"Like every diehard fan has their one and only team that encompasses everything they love and hate about professional sports, I believe every team should have their one and only film that encompasses everything they love and hate about the sport.

Alas, not counting documentaries, most fans are lucky to have just a single film that centers on their hometown team. In fact, across all 124 major american sports teams across the big 4 leagues, only 58 can even say they would be listed as more than a glorified extra in the credits.

With that being said, I have taken the time to pull out 22 Cinema MVPs from baseball teams that have reached the silver screen and celebrate the films that try (and emphasis on try) to capture the beautiful games we can‚Äôt help but love.

But first, some ground rules:

1. Only Feature Films - If I included documentaries, the list would be endless puff pieces by the teams themselves and not really capture the essence of sporting cinema at its finest. Plus it would stop me from covering a lot of garbage, which is half the fun.

2. One Film Per Team - Some teams are blessed with multiple appearances on the big screen (*cough* Yankees *cough*), whereas others have none. To make things a little fair, we are sticking to just one. If I think another film was deserved, I will cite it in honorable mentions.

3. A Film Can Only Be Used Once - Some films have multiple teams with prominent roles. To get more films highlighted, I decided to limit each film to a single appearance.

With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get started!

**Arizona Diamondbacks**

N/A

**Atlanta Braves**

*Trouble with the Curve* ‚Äì Sadly, we start off our official list with a stinker. This hallmark quality baseball soap opera shows oldman clint eastwood losing his edge in the Atlanta Braves scouting department so he needs the help of his daughter Amy Adams. Sadly, they couldn‚Äôt scout a better script. 

**Baltimore Orioles**

N/A

**Boston Red Sox**

*Fever Pitch* ‚Äì Just like Boston stole everything cool they have from Europe anyways, Fever Pitch was a much better film across the pond before sticking Jimmy Fallon all over the front. But hey, its the best ya got.

**Chicago Cubs**

*Rookie of the Year* ‚Äì A lovable piece of shit. Just like every cubs team between the years 1908 and 2016. Depending on how much they suck, you will see more Rowengarner jerseys in wrigley than any other player.

**Chicago White Sox**

*Eight Men Out* ‚Äì I considered Field of Dreams, but realized that a team that named their stadium after a piece of shit who emphatically opposed player agency should be remembered as the team with the most notorious scandal in all of American sports history. Not a bad film though, if a little dusty.

**Cincinnati Reds**

*Hustle* ‚Äì The only film I could find about the Reds, but ESPN produced it and Tom Sizemore plays Pete Rose so I‚Äôm going to count it.

**Cleveland Indians**

*Major League* ‚Äì Finally! A truly great sports film. Written and directed by the screenwriter of The Sting, Major League is a labor of love from a lifelong Cleveland fan. Every baseball lover should see it at least once.

**Colorado Rockies**

N/A

**Detroit Tigers**

*For the Love of the Game* ‚Äì Many ballplayers favorite baseball flick, For the Love of the Game distills the reasons we love to compete into a quick nine innings. Its not about winning or losing. Its about playing. Plus how can you beat Kevin Costner in a sports flick.

**Houston Astros**

*Night Game* ‚Äì How perfect that the team that tried to murder the integrity of the sport is the only team with a horror film on this whole list?

**Kansas City Royals**

*The Royal* ‚Äì Honestly, this sounds like one of the roughest watches on this list, and that includes a Freddie Prinze Jr. rom-com. This film follows Willie Aikens as he tries to recover his life after a 14-year stint in prison due to crack cocaine possession, and I am not callous enough to make a joke about this one. Well at least KC gets a movie.

**Los Angeles Angels**

*Angels in the Outfield* ‚Äì Absolutely star studded and yet a complete mess, no film is more apt than The The Angels Angels of Anaheim.

**Los Angeles Dodgers**

*42* ‚Äì No they weren‚Äôt in LA yet, but no film more encompasses the boys in blue than the film that celebrates one of the great heroes of baseball. Boundary-breaking, classic and winning.

**Miami Marlins**

N/A

**Milwaukee Brewers**

*Mr. 3000* ‚Äì Fun but unremarkable, Mr. 3000 captures the overall mediocrity of the brewers franchise that has an overall losing record with some quick bursts of success.

**Minnesota Twins**

*Little Big League* ‚Äì With an average of 91 losses over the past 8 seasons, it does seem like a child is running this organization.

**New York Mets**

*Game 6* - I know I could‚Äôve picked this one for Boston, but I wanted to spread the wealth (and didn‚Äôt think Men in Black 3 was deserving here). Cold, messy and depressing, like the lives of many a mets fan.

**New York Yankees**

*Pride of the Yankees* ‚Äì There are tons of great films in the Yankees back catalog, but nothing touches Gary Cooper letting us know that, ‚ÄúToday, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.‚Äù

**Oakland Athletics**

*Moneyball* ‚Äì Of course the movie that turns baseball into a business follows the team that is run like a business. One that pushes fans aside in favor of profits. But the difference is that Moneyball fucking slaps.

**Philadelphia Phillies**

*Summer Catch* ‚Äì Oh early 2000s rom-coms. When Freddie Prinze Jr. looked like he was going to be the next big thing before collapsing. Just like the phillies!

**Pittsburgh Pirates**

*Million Dollar Arm* ‚Äì The Pittsburgh Pirates only make an appearance in this lame duck film in the epilogue. Always a bridesmaid Pittsburgh.

**San Diego Padres**

N/A

**San Francisco Giants**

*The Fan* ‚Äì A strange film about fan obsession that never quite hits it out of the park. But alas, The Fan is the only film flying Giants colors so it's the one they're stuck with.

**Seattle Mariners**

*Brampton‚Äôs Own* ‚Äì Very little is known of the Seattle Mariners‚Äô lone foray into Hollywood. Seems to be a depressing story of missed opportunities and sad endings. A fitting pick for the Mariners.

**St. Louis Cardinals**

*The Pride of St. Louis* ‚Äì No not Charles Lindbergh. This film covers the career of hall of fame pitcher Dizzy Dean. His rise, his fall, and his eventual return through broadcasting. This film was actually nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story (when screenplay was too confusing a word for the Oscars) and was the final film written by Herman J. Mankawiecz, the screenwriter for Citizen Kane.

**Tampa Bay Rays**

*The Rookie* ‚Äì Finishing off with another movie you may have seen! This is an all-timer from Dennis Quaid that proves sports is not just for the young in age, but young in spirit. An ode to the perseverance needed to succeed despite insurmountable odds. Like the Rays neverending attempts to draw crowds in the face of sunny Florida.

**Texas Rangers**

N/A

**Toronto Blue Jays**

N/A

**Washington Nationals**

N/A

And that‚Äôs all folks! With its long seasons and storied past, baseball easily has the greatest impact on American cinema, which is probably why only 8 teams have never had a truly noteworthy appearance on the big screen. Obviously, not every picture on here is an all time classic or even a hidden gem, but they represent a little piece of history in each team‚Äôs legacy. That has got to count for something. (And please let me know if I missed a film, or you think the movie chosen is incorrect. There's a lot of cinema out there and I am but one lowly cubs fan)"

*Hustle* ‚Äì The only film I could find about the Reds, but ESPN produced it and Tom Sizemore plays Pete Rose so I‚Äôm going to count it.

**Cleveland Indians**

*Major League* ‚Äì Finally! A truly great sports film. Written and directed by the screenwriter of The Sting, Major League is a labor of love from a lifelong Cleveland fan. Every baseball lover should see it at least once.

**Colorado Rockies**

N/A

**Detroit Tigers**

*For the Love of the Game* ‚Äì Many ballplayers favorite baseball flick, For the Love of the Game distills the reasons we love to compete into a quick nine innings. Its not about winning or losing. Its about playing. Plus how can you beat Kevin Costner in a sports flick.

**Houston Astros**

*Night Game* ‚Äì How perfect that the team that tried to murder the integrity of the sport is the only team with a horror film on this whole list?

**Kansas City Royals**

*The Royal* ‚Äì Honestly, this sounds like one of the roughest watches on this list, and that includes a Freddie Prinze Jr. rom-com. This film follows Willie Aikens as he tries to recover his life after a 14-year stint in prison due to crack cocaine possession, and I am not callous enough to make a joke about this one. Well at least KC gets a movie.

**Los Angeles Angels**

*Angels in the Outfield* ‚Äì Absolutely star studded and yet a complete mess, no film is more apt than The The Angels Angels of Anaheim.

**Los Angeles Dodgers**

*42* ‚Äì No they weren‚Äôt in LA yet, but no film more encompasses the boys in blue than the film that celebrates one of the great heroes of baseball. Boundary-breaking, classic and winning.

**Miami Marlins**

N/A

**Milwaukee Brewers**

*Mr. 3000* ‚Äì Fun but unremarkable, Mr. 3000 captures the overall mediocrity of the brewers franchise that has an overall losing record with some quick bursts of success.

**Minnesota Twins**

*Little Big League* ‚Äì With an average of 91 losses over the past 8 seasons, it does seem like a child is running this organization.

**New York Mets**

*Game 6* - I know I could‚Äôve picked this one for Boston, but I wanted to spread the wealth (and didn‚Äôt think Men in Black 3 was deserving here). Cold, messy and depressing, like the lives of many a mets fan.

**New York Yankees**

*Pride of the Yankees* ‚Äì There are tons of great films in the Yankees back catalog, but nothing touches Gary Cooper letting us know that, ‚ÄúToday, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.‚Äù

**Oakland Athletics**

*Moneyball* ‚Äì Of course the movie that turns baseball into a business follows the team that is run like a business. One that pushes fans aside in favor of profits. But the difference is that Moneyball fucking slaps.

**Philadelphia Phillies**

*Summer Catch* ‚Äì Oh early 2000s rom-coms. When Freddie Prinze Jr. looked like he was going to be the next big thing before collapsing. Just like the phillies!

**Pittsburgh Pirates**

*Million Dollar Arm* ‚Äì The Pittsburgh Pirates only make an appearance in this lame duck film in the epilogue. Always a bridesmaid Pittsburgh.

**San Diego Padres**

N/A

**San Francisco Giants**

*The Fan* ‚Äì A strange film about fan obsession that never quite hits it out of the park. But alas, The Fan is the only film flying Giants colors so it's the one they're stuck with.

**Seattle Mariners**

*Brampton‚Äôs Own* ‚Äì Very little is known of the Seattle Mariners‚Äô lone foray into Hollywood. Seems to be a depressing story of missed opportunities and sad endings. A fitting pick for the Mariners.

**St. Louis Cardinals**

*The Pride of St. Louis* ‚Äì No not Charles Lindbergh. This film covers the career of hall of fame pitcher Dizzy Dean. His rise, his fall, and his eventual return through broadcasting. This film was actually nominated for the Academy Award for Best Story (when screenplay was too confusing a word for the Oscars) and was the final film written by Herman J. Mankawiecz, the screenwriter for Citizen Kane.

**Tampa Bay Rays**

*The Rookie* ‚Äì Finishing off with another movie you may have seen! This is an all-timer from Dennis Quaid that proves sports is not just for the young in age, but young in spirit. An ode to the perseverance needed to succeed despite insurmountable odds. Like the Rays neverending attempts to draw crowds in the face of sunny Florida.

**Texas Rangers**

N/A

**Toronto Blue Jays**

N/A

**Washington Nationals**

N/A

And that‚Äôs all folks! With its long seasons and storied past, baseball easily has the greatest impact on American cinema, which is probably why only 8 teams have never had a truly noteworthy appearance on the big screen. Obviously, not every picture on here is an all time classic or even a hidden gem, but they represent a little piece of history in each team‚Äôs legacy. That has got to count for something. (And please let me know if I missed a film, or you think the movie chosen is incorrect. There's a lot of cinema out there and I am but one lowly cubs fan)

So join me next time as I go through the National Football League and determine the A-listers from the garbage bin."

The Frontend UI goes to FUCKING zero. 

Not the case if projects use an open source platform called Oyster which was developed by Marlin over the course of this bear market. It allows projects to go serverless and removes every project's single point of failure (centralized cloud servers) without having to build on ICP or do anything too gei. Even web2 companies can use it. Games can use it. It's pretty useful. 

Frontends with Oyster:

* Less vulnerable to exploits
* Server farms blowing up have no effect
* The UI everyone uses can't be taken down with a strongly worded letter to AWS

Oyster has other uses such as zk proof hardware acceleration and allows for decentralized backends as well. Oyster is how DeFi can actually become DeFi. Is this a 1000x play? Probably not, but Marlin ticker POND is a good midcap play.

\#||Team|Œî|Comment|Record
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[](/ATL)|**Braves**|**0**| We clinched the division and a bye in the first round this week...so that's good. Being swept by the Marlins wasn't great, but 2 of the 3 games we were without Ronald. The really proves how valuable he is at the top of our order. We look to get as healthy as possible in these last few weeks. |**96-53**
**2**|[](/LAD)|**Dodgers**|**+1**| The Dodgers officially clinched their 10th division title in the last 11 years which I would say is at least moderately impressive. Despite all the doubters and people who root for the perennial underdog Dodgers they have come through once again through pure grit and salary. Even our hungover B team beat the Mariners (sorry Mariners bros and sis's). I cannot wait for the playoffs.  |**91-57**
**3**|[](/BAL)|**Orioles**|**-1**| Best case scenario from this weekend would have been a sweep and the O's be 6 games up, worst case scenario would have been to be swept and the O's be 2 games back. What happened was a split in a very very good series. The O's have a 2-game lead in the East and have clinched a playoff spot for the first time in 7 years. Now it is off to Houston for 3 and Cleveland for 4. Two places where teams still have something to play for. Time to go get it. |**93-56**
**4**|[](/TB)|**Rays**|**0**| One out away from amazing success for the week, the Rays will have to settle for clinching a 5th straight playoff berth. And for a new stadium. Wait what? A deal was struck?? WE'RE NOT LEARNING FRENCH?!?! Breath held until it actually opens, but it's the most positive thing that's been announced after years of wacky rumors. Maybe they can still win the division too? |**92-59**
**5**|[](/HOU)|**Astros**|**0**| Overall, I'd call this week a struggle bus week. Our playoff hopes are really coming down to the wire and it's unclear whether we can manage to have both our pitching and hitting on the same page at the same time. At least the Orioles will be hungover today, so we might win this one. |**84-66**
**6**|[](/MIL)|**Brewers**|**+2**| When Milwaukee traded for Mark Canha at the deadline I thought he was just going to be a rental.  Now? I think that there's going to be some very serious discussion about if Milwaukee picks up his 11MM option for next season.  With Milwaukee he's hitting .319 and getting on base at a rather silly .404 rate.   |**84-65**
**7**|[](/TOR)|**Blue Jays**|**-1**| What started as the worst week of the season quickly turned into proof that while the Baseball Gods may be cruel, they sometimes bathe you in the glory of their love. A four-game sweep at the hands of the Walker Texas Rangers (outscored 35-9) was followed by sweeping the Red Sox and the Rangers, Mariners, and Astros all forgetting how to win, propelling us right back into the WC2 with a 78.2% chance to make the playoffs, per FanGraphs. The offensive woes are still concerning (apart from Vladdy, who's been hotter than ever the last two weeks), as we needed all sorts of fuckery to pull off that Boston sweep, but thankfully our pitching staff is absolute nails. It's tough to realize how far below our expectations we are, watching TB and Baltimore battle for the division as they clinch playoff spots, but all we care about now is making a postseason run. Two home-and-away series remain against the Rays and the Yankees, with a constant eye on the AL West teams fighting each other. |**83-67**
**8**|[](/TEX)|**Rangers**|**+3**| I don't even know anymore. |**82-67**
**9**|[](/PHI)|**Phillies**|**0**| The Phillies continue to lose winnable games and hover around .500 overall. Thankfully, the rest of the Wild Card race isn't doing anything to cause stress. Braves, Mets, Pirates, Mets to end off the year isn't too bad. |**81-68**
**10**|[](/SEA)|**Mariners**|**-3**| The September vibes are, to put it mildly, not great. Far too many games where defeat has been clutched from the jaws of victory, and the M's find themselves on the outside looking in. That said, it's AL West opponents from here on out, and like I said last week, those final 10 games are going to be the decider. I still think this team will end up sneaking in, but it's going to be close and all depends on if the offense can show up over the next two weeks or if they burnt it all out in August.  Up next: 3 @ SELL THE TEAM, 3 @ Texas gauntlet part one |**81-68**
**11**|[](/MIN)|**Twins**|**+1**| The magic number is at 6, the team is playing well, and the last two weeks are set up exactly how you'd hope to get players rest while warming up for the postseason. Let's go! |**79-71**
**12**|[](/ARI)|**D-Backs**|**+1**| The Diamondbacks are the most hated team (outside of the Bears) in Chicago at the moment, having taken 6 of 7 against the Cubs in the last two weeks. The bullpen has been nails and the offense is playing like their lives depend on it‚Äîcan the starting pitching get the memo, too? The next two weeks will be exciting, as Snakes fans hope to see their team in the postseason for the first time since 2017 |**79-72**
**13**|[](/CHC1)|**Cubs**|**-3**| The Cubs had a disastrous road trip that they simply could not afford, going 1-5 against the Rockies and D-Backs. As a result, what was once a decent lead in the NL Wild Card race has completely eroded; the Cubs are out of a Wild Card spot as it currently stands. The biggest culprit has been an inability to get clutch hits, as over the past week they have a WRC+ of 83 in non low leverage situations. Additionally, the once stout bullpen has been hampered by injuries to Adbert Alzolay and Michael Fulmer. The Cubs need a dramatic turnaround against the Pirates and Rockies to avoid a repeat of the painful 2019 collapse. |**78-72**
**14**|[](/MIA)|**Marlins**|**0**| Sweepy has returned! God damn was it good to see the fish sweep the barves.This offense looks scary right now, jazz is getting hot and burger/bell keeps rollin. The return of Soler has apparently been what this offense needed, too. Shoutout to Arraez for his multiple lead off dingers. Idk how the bullpen is gonna keep strong but Tanner Scott still has massive balls. One last shoutout to Jacob Stallings, who closed out yesterdays game with a scoreless 9th inning. We got the mets and brew crew visiting miami this week. |**78-72**
**15**|[](/CIN)|**Reds**|**+2**| I DON‚ÄôT HANDLE ANXIETY VERY WELL. The Reds are fighting for a playoff spot and I can‚Äôt take the anxious mood. I don‚Äôt handle it well, I‚Äôm trying to find purpose, yesterday I drove my motorcycle into the pond outside my house. I tried to buy a Maya Fuji painting for $6,000 dollars. I didn‚Äôt even like the painting. Who the fuck is Maya Fuji? I have to go to court tomorrow for the divorce proceedings, I got into a bidding war on Ebay over a lot of 700 Blu Ray movies just for the excitement. I WON. What the hell am I going to do with 700 Blu Ray movies? I checked the lot, there‚Äôs 7 copies of Mr. Popper‚Äôs Penguins. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH 7 COPIES OF MR. POPPER‚ÄôS PENGUINS? Imagine you‚Äôre me, you now have half a dozen copies of Mr. Popper‚Äôs Penguins on Blu Ray. Congratulations champ, what now? This is me. I want purpose, I‚Äôve been searching for it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the bottom of a box with 700 blu ray movies in it. I‚Äôve always liked history, maybe I could be a history teacher. I would have to go to college for that, but hey what‚Äôs $60,000 of debt to stand in the way of dreams? I can take it. My credit score might not take it but I physically can. You know what, i‚Äôve convinced myself, I‚Äôm gonna search for some colleges that offer teaching programs. I‚Äôm gonna do it. Right after I check the price for a Blu Ray player. |**78-73**
**16**|[](/SFG)|**Giants**|**0**| I don't know. We are in the ""find out"" phase of the baseball season. It's too late to do anything other than watch it happen.Assuming magic doesn't happen, this is looking like an absolute wasted year. |**76-74**
**17**|[](/NYY)|**Yankees**|**+1**|  |**76-74**
**18**|[](/SD)|**Padres**|**+1**| Soto's had his first San Diego slam, and first of his career, which was a surprise to me. Also...did the Padres just win 4 in a row? I didn't think that was alowed?  |**72-78**
**19**|[](/BOS)|**Red Sox**|**-4**| Well, I guess that's it for the Chaim era in Boston. He was asked to do multiple things that directly conflicted with each other, did his best to please everyone, fell a little short on all fronts, and got fired right before things got good again. Ownership claimed to want to build an organization that could compete consistently, and then pulled out early just like they did with Cherington. They better hope the next guy gets a ring with this core. Regardless of how you felt about Chaim, we can all agree on this: fuck John Henry and fuck Fenway Sports Group. |**74-76**
**20**|[](/CLE)|**Guardians**|**0**| The Guardians have 12 games left and need to go 9-3 to break 500. I don't see that happening. Oh well, you can't have a good year every year. We did have a good series against the Rangers this weekend, which was nice after that awful trip to California. |**72-78**
**21**|[](/NYM)|**Mets**|**+1**| At least the Knicks come back soon. |**69-80**
**22**|[](/DET)|**Tigers**|**+2**| Playing the Angels is a lot easier when their whole roster is injured eh? Miggy's go ahead knock in the 10th on Saturday was a fun experience as we geet to the halfway mark of the future HoFer's final month in the Bigs. This week: 3 at LAD, 4 at OAK to wrap up the final road trip of the season. |**70-79**
**23**|[](/PIT)|**Pirates**|**0**| A good week that could have been better if Ji-hwan Bae knew how to throw to first (or hit, or play the field, or be a good person). The Bucs bounced back from dropping the opener against the Nats to steal 3 of 4 from Washington, then dropped 2 of 3 to the Yankees because of a blown double play in the 9th of Friday's game. This week, the Pirates have a chance to do serious damage to the playoff odds of two hated rivals. I hope they can pull it off. |**70-80**
**24**|[](/LAA )|**Angels**|**-3**| I don't even really remember what it is like to enjoy baseball anymore. There have been plenty of flashes here or there the past decade, mostly just because of Mike Trout or Shohei, but that childlike love I used to have for the sport is just dead and I really don't think it is ever coming back.  |**68-82**
**25**|[](/STL)|**Cardinals**|**0**|**No Blurb Submitted**  |**66-83**
**26**|[](/WSH)|**Nationals**|**0**| Same as last week. Lerners, please sell. |**66-84**
**27**|[](/CHW)|**White Sox**|**0**| This weekend, I went to Milwaukee with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. We visited the Sprecher brewery for a tour, checked out Lakefront Brewery for the beautiful views and drinks, explored the Mitchell Park domes and came home with some beautiful orchids. We had a couple great dinners and a very memorable brunch at Brunch it Up. The only time baseball came up was when a couple next to us at brunch talked about how they were in town for the Brewers game, which just sounded like a nice thing to do. |**57-93**
**28**|[](/COL)|**Rockies**|**0**| If the Rockies can go 7-6 until the end of the season, they can avoid 100 losses.  Unfortunately all but three of those games are against teams either heading to the playoffs or in close playoff races, so they'll be tough.  Those three games against a non-contending team are against the Padres, so even that might be difficult. |**56-93**
**29**|[](/KCR)|**Royals**|**0**| Keepin it  üíØ year in year out, that's the grind life baby.  We put a lot of effort into sucking ass. |**48-102**
**30**|[](/OAK)|**Athletics**|**0**|  |**46-103**"

**The Whole Article from the MLB app:**

The second half of the 2023 season is just about to begin, but it‚Äôs not too early to start thinking about next year.

MLB officially unveiled its full 2024 regular-season schedule on Thursday, one day after announcing its [slate of international games](https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-world-tour-2024), as part of the MLB World Tour. After the Rays and Red Sox meet in the Dominican Republic Series during Spring Training (March 9-10), the Seoul Series (March 20-21) will kick off the 2024 season with the Dodgers and Padres playing MLB‚Äôs first games in Korea. The Mexico City Series (Astros vs. Rockies, April 27-28) and [London Series](https://www.mlb.com/news/london-series-2024-will-be-mets-vs-phillies) (Mets vs. Phillies, June 8-9) also will return from 2023.

There is of course plenty to look forward to in the U.S. and Canada as well. All 30 clubs are slated to play on Opening Day (Thursday, March 28), and the regular season wraps up on Sunday, Sept. 29, with the 94th All-Star Game presented by Mastercard set for July 16 at Globe Life Field in Arlington.

Along the way, highlights will include two planned doubleheaders (Rangers at A‚Äôs on May 8, Rockies at Giants on July 27) and [a special game in Birmingham, Ala.](https://www.mlb.com/news/cardinals-giants-to-play-at-rickwood-field-in-2024), between the Cardinals and Giants at Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and the former home of the Negro Leagues‚Äô Birmingham Black Barons. All 30 teams also will play on Jackie Robinson Day (April 15), Lou Gehrig Day (June 2), the Fourth of July and Roberto Clemente Day (Sept. 15).

Here is a look at some highlights from each team‚Äôs 2024 schedule:

### AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST

**Blue Jays**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Rays*

Toronto will start the season with what figures to be a challenging 10-game road trip at Tampa Bay, Houston and the Yankees before holding its home opener on April 8 against the Mariners. Three visiting teams will make their first trips to Rogers Centre in at least eight years: the Rockies (April 12-14, first trip since 2013), Dodgers (April 26-28, first since 2016) and Marlins (Sept. 27-29, first since 2015), who will finish the season in Toronto.

**Orioles**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Angels*

The Orioles won‚Äôt see much of the AL East early on, playing only three of their first 27 games against division foes through April 28. One series to circle on the calendar: From July 26-28, Manny Machado is slated to play only his second series as a visitor at Camden Yards -- and first since 2019 -- when the Padres come to town. The D-backs also come through in May, making their first visit since 2016, in a showdown of two of this season‚Äôs most exciting young teams.

**Rays**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Blue Jays*

Will 2024 bring another hot start for the Rays? When they won 13 straight games to begin 2023, 10 of those victories came at home. Tampa Bay will be back at The Trop for 14 of its first 20 games next year, including visits from the Rangers, Giants and Angels. On the other hand, 16 of the Rays‚Äô final 22 contests will come on the road, concluding with a series at Fenway Park from Sept. 27-29.

**Red Sox**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Mariners*

After a season-opening 10-game road trip, baseball will return to Fenway Park on April 9, when the Red Sox host the Orioles. Later that month, the Cubs will arrive in Boston for only their fourth regular-season series at Fenway and first since 2017. It‚Äôs been even longer since the Red Sox have hosted the Padres (2013), who will bring Xander Bogaerts back to Boston for what is sure to be an emotional return from June 28-30.

**Yankees**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Astros*

Yes, the Yankees will begin 2024 on the road against their frequent postseason tormentor, the Astros, while the home opener is set for April 5 against the Blue Jays. The 2024 schedule also brings a rare visit from the Yankees‚Äô long-ago New York counterpart, the Dodgers (June 7-9). While the Yankees have hosted the Dodgers for a whopping 32 World Series games over the years (21 before the franchise left Brooklyn), L.A. has only played five regular-season games at Yankee Stadium -- two in 2013 and three in '16.

### AL CENTRAL

**Guardians**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at A‚Äôs*

Cleveland will host the White Sox and Yankees for its first homestand of the season between April 8-14, but a more hotly anticipated visit from a New York team will come the next month. The Mets will be at Progressive Field from May 20-22, which will be Francisco Lindor‚Äôs first time suiting up there as a visitor after getting traded prior to the 2021 season. Lindor did already face the Guardians at Citi Field this May, hitting a walk-off single in the 10th inning of the first matchup.

**Royals**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Twins*

Three NL West teams who haven‚Äôt spent much time at Kauffman Stadium over the years will come to town in 2024: the Padres, D-backs and Giants, who have played two games in Kansas City (in 2017) since celebrating a World Series title there after winning Game 7 in 2014. The Royals also will host the Marlins for the first time since 2013.

**Tigers**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at White Sox*

The Tigers‚Äô home opener will be April 5 against the A‚Äôs, while the Twins, Rangers, Royals and Cardinals will also come through that month. One Interleague series of note is slated for July 12-14, when the Dodgers make their visit to Comerica Park since 2017. Freddie Freeman has not played a game in Detroit since 2013, while Clayton Kershaw -- if he returns for another season in L.A. -- could have a chance to take the mound at Comerica Park for the first time since June 15, 2008, when he was 20 years old and making his fifth career start.

**Twins**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Royals*

The Guardians will serve as the visiting team for Target Field‚Äôs home opener on April 4. In the second half, the Phillies (July 22-24) and Marlins (Sept. 24-26) both will come to Minnesota for the first time since 2016. Target Field is the only active MLB ballpark where two-time NL MVP Bryce Harper has yet to play a regular-season game. The Miami series will offer the return of former Twin Luis Arraez, who has spent 2023 chasing a .400 average after an offseason trade.

**White Sox**  
Opening Day: March 28 vs. Tigers

The White Sox will both start and finish the regular season against the Tigers, closing things out at Detroit from Sept. 27-29. The Sox also get an early visit from the Braves (April 1-3), making their first appearance at Guaranteed Rate Field since 2016, which was two years before the electrifying Ronald Acu√±a Jr. debuted.

### AL WEST

**Angels**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Orioles*

The Angel Stadium home opener is set for April 5 against the Red Sox, and in an odd quirk, the Angels don‚Äôt welcome an AL West opponent until June 7, when the Astros come to Anaheim. One notable visitor during that stretch is the Phillies (April 29-May 1). Bryce Harper‚Äôs only career game at Angel Stadium came in 2017, and he has yet to appear there in a Phillies uniform.

**Astros**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Yankees*

Houston will host some big early-season series in 2024, as the Yankees, Blue Jays, Rangers and Braves all pass through Minute Maid Park over the first three weeks. Atlanta‚Äôs series from April 15-17 will be its first there since clinching the 2021 World Series. Ronald Acu√±a Jr. could also make his Minute Maid Park debut, since he missed that World Series due to injury. The Astros will also face the Rockies in the Mexico City Series on April 27-28.

**Athletics**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Guardians*

This will be the seventh time in franchise history that the A‚Äôs have opened their season against the Guardians, with the most recent instance coming in 2014. The A‚Äôs also face some big early series in April, hosting the Red Sox and Cardinals while traveling to take on the Rangers, Yankees, Guardians and Orioles. On May 8, the club will host the Rangers for the first of two scheduled doubleheaders across the Majors in 2024.

**Mariners**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Red Sox*

For just the second time in franchise history, the Mariners will begin a season against the Red Sox, who also came to Seattle for Opening Day in 2000 -- several months before Julio Rodr√≠guez was born. From April 26-28, the Mariners will welcome the D-backs and 2023 NL Rookie of the Year Award favorite Corbin Carroll, a Seattle native who just received a warm welcome during the All-Star festivities at T-Mobile Park.

**Rangers**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Cubs*

This is the fifth time since 2014 -- and the fourth since 2019 -- that the Rangers have hosted an NL team on Opening Day. (The Cubs were also the opponent in ‚Äò19 and bashed their way to a 12-4 win). The Rangers also have All-Star Game hosting duties in 2024, with the 94th edition of the Midsummer Classic set for July 16 at Globe Life Field. It‚Äôs the second time the ASG has come to town, with the 1995 edition taking place at The Ballpark in Arlington.

### NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST

**Braves**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Phillies*

The first homestand of the season at Truist Park (April 5-11) will feature the D-backs and then the NL East rival Mets. From April 26-28, the Guardians will come to Truist Park for the first time since it opened in 2017, with Cleveland star Jos√© Ram√≠rez playing only his second series in Atlanta after appearing at Turner Field in 2016. The Braves‚Äô slate of home Interleague matchups also includes the Rangers, Red Sox, Rays and Blue Jays, among others.

**Marlins**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Pirates*

The Pirates and Angels will be in town for the season-opening homestand before the Marlins embark on a road trip to face the Cardinals and Yankees. From July 5-7, the White Sox will come to Miami for a series for only the third time in franchise history (2004 and ‚Äò16), bringing star center fielder and Cuba native Luis Robert Jr. for his debut there. The Rangers, Guardians and Mariners are among the other Interleague opponents who will visit Miami in 2024.

**Mets**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Brewers*

Citi Field won‚Äôt play host to an NL East foe until a homestand against the Braves and Phillies from May 10-14. Among the early home opponents for the Mets are the Royals, who will visit for the first time since 2016 -- the year after Kansas City clinched the World Series there. From June 8-9, the Mets will then journey across the pond to take on the Phillies in the 2024 London Series. The Twins come to Queens from July 29-31, scheduled to be Carlos Correa‚Äôs second career game against the Mets, first at Citi Field and first since his free-agent deal with the team fell apart last offseason.

**Nationals**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Reds*

After starting out in Cincinnati, the Nationals will return to Washington to play their home opener against the Pirates on April 1, beginning a homestand that will also include a visit from the Phillies. Other highlights include the Twins‚Äô first visit to Nationals Park since 2016 (May 20-22), a Fourth of July tilt against the Mets and a series against the Angels (Aug. 9-11) that could feature former Nats star Anthony Rendon‚Äôs first games back in D.C. as an opponent since leaving as a free agent following the club‚Äôs 2019 championship run.

**Phillies**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Braves*

The Phillies will get 16 of their first 22 games at home before embarking upon a 10-game road trip to Cincinnati, San Diego and Anaheim. They will have an even more ambitious trip from June 8-9, taking part in the 2024 London Series against the Mets. Philly will also face New York in seven of its final 16 regular-season games. The Guardians (first trip to Citizens Bank Park since 2016) and Astros (first since 2017) highlight the home Interleague slate.

### NL CENTRAL

**Brewers**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Mets*

The Mets will bookend the Brewers‚Äô 2024 schedule, as they also come to Milwaukee from Sept. 27-29. The first homestand of the season at American Family Field (April 2-7) will feature a pair of Interleague series against the Twins and Mariners. A few AL East clubs also come to town along the way: the Yankees (April 26-28), Rays (April 29-May 1) and Blue Jays (June 10-12).

**Cardinals**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Dodgers*

The Cardinals will play their home opener on April 4 against the Marlins. St. Louis also will have one very special home game that won‚Äôt take place at Busch Stadium. That‚Äôs scheduled for June 20 in Birmingham, Ala., where the Cardinals will be the designated home club for a matchup with the Giants at historic Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the United States and the former home of the Negro Leagues' Birmingham Black Barons. St. Louis‚Äô Interleague matchups will also bring some young stars to Busch Stadium for the first time, including Rafael Devers (Red Sox, May 17-19), Adley Rutschman (Orioles, May 20-22), Wander Franco (Rays, Aug. 6-8) and Julio Rodr√≠guez (Mariners, Sept. 6-8).

**Cubs**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Rangers*

Another season at Wrigley Field will get underway with an April 1-7 homestand against the Rockies and Dodgers. Plenty of intriguing Interleague opponents will make the pilgrimage to Wrigley throughout 2024, including the Astros (April 23-25), who have not played there since 2013, the first season after Houston departed the NL Central for the AL West. An Aug. 16-18 series against the Blue Jays will bring Vladimir Guerrero Jr.‚Äôs Wrigley debut, while a Sept. 6-8 series against the Yankees will bring back Anthony Rizzo for the first time since his 2021 trade.

**Reds**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Nationals*

Cincinnati will host its traditional Opening Day game once again in 2024, taking on the Nationals. The club will face a challenging stretch run, however, playing 14 of its final 20 games on the road, with trips to face the Mets, Cardinals, Twins, Guardians and Cubs. In between, the American League squads to come through Cincinnati will include the Angels, Astros, A‚Äôs, Orioles and Red Sox. This will be the first visit for the A‚Äôs since 2016.

**Pirates**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Marlins*

The Pirates will travel to Miami and Washington to begin the year before PNC Park hosts the Orioles and Tigers for its first homestand (April 5-9). The Orioles, Angels (May 6-8) and Rays (June 21-23) will all come to town for the first time since at least 2017, with Baltimore‚Äôs Adley Rutschman and Tampa Bay‚Äôs Wander Franco among those set for their Pittsburgh debuts. Mike Trout, meanwhile, has only played three career games at PNC Park. For the annual Roberto Clemente Day on Sept. 15 -- when all 30 teams will be in action -- the Pirates will host the Royals.

### NL WEST

**D-backs**  
*Opening Day: March 28 vs. Rockies*

After the D-backs host the Rockies for a four-game set beginning on Opening Day, a much less familiar foe will come to town. The Yankees (April 1-3) have only played 11 games at Chase Field in their history -- in the regular season, that is -- and Aaron Judge has yet to appear in a game there. The White Sox (June 14-16) and Blue Jays (July 12-14) also play at Arizona for the first time since at least 2017, which means potential Chase Field debuts for the likes of Luis Robert Jr. and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The D-backs also end their season at home with series against division rivals -- the Giants (Sept. 23-25) and Padres (Sept. 27-29).

**Dodgers**  
*Opening Day: March 20 at Padres (in Seoul, South Korea)*

The Dodgers have the honor of taking part in the Seoul Series, the first MLB regular-season games played in Korea. The franchise, which has featured four South Korean players including Chan Ho Park and Hyun Jin Ryu, will take on the Padres there in the first two games of the season (March 20-21). L.A. will be the designated road team for the first game and the home team for the second. Highlights of the 2024 schedule at Dodger Stadium include a matchup with the Nationals on Jackie Robinson Day (April 15), Corey Seager‚Äôs regular-season return as a member of the Rangers (June 11-13) and the first visit for the Red Sox (July 19-21) since the 2018 World Series.

**Giants**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at Padres*

The Giants begin the season with 10 straight NL West contests, including both their season opener and home opener (April 5) against the Padres. The Rickwood Field matchup against the Cardinals in Birmingham, Ala., on June 20 will have the Giants play on a field a teenager named Willie Mays once roamed in the Negro Leagues. San Francisco also hosts the second of two planned doubleheaders across the Majors (July 27 vs. the Rockies). And be on the lookout for visits from a couple of Giants targets from last offseason: Aaron Judge (May 31-June 2 with the Yankees), who has never played at Oracle Park, and Carlos Correa (July 12-14 with the Twins).

**Padres**  
*Opening Day: March 20 vs. Dodgers (in Seoul, South Korea)*

San Diego plays its first two games in Asia, facing the Dodgers in the Seoul Series as infielder Ha-Seong Kim returns to his native Korea, where he starred in the KBO before coming to the Majors in 2021. The home opener at Petco Park is set for March 28 against the Giants, who will be in town for four games, followed by the Cardinals for three. The Blue Jays (April 19-21) are set to visit for the first time since 2013, while the 2024 schedule also promises Aaron Judge‚Äôs first regular-season visit to Petco Park with the Yankees (May 24-26), although he homered twice there in the 2020 ALDS against the Rays.

**Rockies**  
*Opening Day: March 28 at D-backs*

The Rockies do a lot of traveling early, heading to Arizona, Chicago, Toronto and Philadelphia over the first few weeks of the season. They also will fly south to face the Astros in the Mexico City Series from April 27-28. The Rockies‚Äô April 5 home opener will be their first time hosting the Rays since 2016, while the Red Sox (July 22-24) and Orioles (Aug. 30-Sept. 1) also are scheduled for rare visits to Coors Field."

Has anyone found a good time of day to give Gordy/Cody a gift?,storyofseasons,115s472,2023-02-18 16:24:40,9,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/storyofseasons/comments/115s472/has_anyone_found_a_good_time_of_day_to_give/,stardustandsunshine,SoS,"I was just curious whether anyone had discovered a particular time of day when Gordy is consistently available to accept a gift, or if it's totally random/luck. I know Matthew/Marlin often has his hands in his pockets, but if you wait for a few in-game minutes with the gift already in your hand, you can usually catch him with his hands free for a few seconds while he walks around. Same with Molly/Muffy while she's at work. You can often catch Gustafa and Molly going for a walk in the late morning before they get busy playing guitar or working. Gordy, on the other hand, always seems to be walking around with his arms crossed whenever I visit him, no matter the time of day, even if he's away from his house at the beach or turtle pond.

I'm in summer and have 3+ hearts with all the other marriage candidates, but I'm still at 1 heart with Gordy because I've only been able to give him 2 or 3 gifts so far when I just happened to find him going for a walk beside the river, and it seems pretty random whether he's available or not."

Animal Crossing Pocket Camp v5.3.0c Update,ACPocketCamp,zylt0e,2022-12-29 19:36:56,178,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACPocketCamp/comments/zylt0e/animal_crossing_pocket_camp_v530c_update/,windkirby,Datamine,"https://preview.redd.it/iyluf1z0ix8a1.png?width=128&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebd69ffec4b3ec17916b72d1ab388c3f4e630d3

Happy New Year, Santa‚Äôs cleanup crew! Pocket Camp‚Äôs celebration for 2023 is highly similar to its celebrations every year with a look backwards into the traditions of Animal Crossing‚Äôs Japanese origins. But if you have a soft spot for old villages in Japan or if winter‚Äôs icy chills have you in need of a hot bath (or a hot bowl of noodles!), at least this month‚Äôs got you covered. And of course it‚Äôs the new year but I still owe the same thanks this time to Miranda for help with the banners and tip screens, PanchamBro and Bassieeee for help with the text datamine, hammilime for help with the seasonal rewards, and everyone else who helped unpack this update!

&#x200B;

[Twitter preview for January 2023 in Pocket Camp](https://preview.redd.it/op8el5y1ix8a1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=b258010ac23d07899d97272fe015fcaebf893fd6)

* **Version Codes**
   * v5.3.0b was d8da4, v5.3.0c is **f592d**.
   * This is a client-side update that should not require downloading a new version of the app.
   * It took them 3 years, but this update internally fixed the anniversary dialogue where snooty villagers always say the campsite was built 2 years ago. Of course this fix is irrelevant now, but this bodes well that we‚Äôll make it to Pocket Camp‚Äôs 6th birthday!

&#x200B;

* **New Bugs and Fish Creature Season for Winter**
   * Be still my heart‚Äîa year and a half and I‚Äôd given up on new king fish, but here we have a lengthy, extremely majestic new catch in the form of the king stringfish! But again, like with the Nomura‚Äôs jellyfish, not to worry for those still traumatized by the king goliath frog; this catch appears to be the typical 1 in 1000 or so fish. If you hang out at Lost Lure Creek enough, you have a good shot at stringing up this total whopper before the winter‚Äôs end‚Ä¶ Best of luck! ~~I totally haven‚Äôt been trying to find it when I should be working on the thread, I promise~~. Another newcomer makes his debut in the form of the black rockfish, a decently worthwhile ocean catch you might occasionally encounter when expecting an octopus or red snapper. Not to be seen, though, is the candy cane snail shell datamined last month. It looked so pretty, too, and probably even tasted better than real canes‚Äîbut it appears at least for now it may be unused content. Perhaps we‚Äôll see it pop up next December. Other than that, this winter‚Äôs creature set is similar to last year‚Äôs albeit this time with significantly fewer rare-tier critters to appease your campers with. I guess last season‚Äôs offerings of two rare bugs was a bit unusually generous. Last but not least, though, is the regular dab‚Äôs debut as a requested common. He‚Äôs not worthless (or at least not *only* worth 10 bells) anymore! Please pat him on the back when you see him. If you can figure out which part of the dab is the back, anyway.

Below is a table of the new creatures, their prices, their shadow sizes (for fish, on a scale of 1-6 with 1 being the smallest and 6 being the largest), their habitat (for bugs), and their rewards when given to campers (when they ask you for ‚Äúany fish‚Äù or ‚Äúany bug‚Äù). Please note that creatures available during the autumn that did not retire, such as the crucian carp, freshwater goby, red snapper, tiger butterfly, etc., have stayed in the game and will continue functioning as they did before. These creatures are not included in the tables below. Brand-new creatures will be listed in bold, and eligibility for specific animal requests will be listed separately in bold. As usual I‚Äôll whip up an ""Any"" Requests Infographic for this season as soon as I can, ideally in about a week.

* **New January Terrain ‚Äì Hot-Spring District**
   * This month‚Äôs new terrain parts will allow you to transform your campsite into solemn, stone-paved Japanese village warmly lit with traditional red lanterns. It‚Äôs the perfect setting to reflect on ancient ceremonies or spirits not-so-departed as we cross the threshold to the new year‚Ä¶ What wisdoms lie within these time-worn dwellings, and what new discoveries lie behind hand-fashioned panels? Whether for a celebratory gathering with familiar campers or a lonely walk in a distant town exploring the melancholy atmosphere, sojourn to a spiritual Japanese town when this terrain becomes available December 29th GMT.

[Tip screen for the hot-spring district terrain; auto-designer images featuring the hot-spring district terrain and items from January's main three events; preview image for Blathers's Piping Hot Food](https://preview.redd.it/wn5go173kx8a1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3104d7676659935798d603e252415f1701ed94a)

&#x200B;

* **Together! Minigame ‚Äì Together! ka-BOOM!**
   * Pocket Camp‚Äôs latest minigame will have us enjoying a fireworks show with our campers as we tap the screen (likely with specific timing, but that‚Äôs speculation) to earn tallied points. But remember, even though there‚Äôs an accumulative goal with this thing, the points are made up and don‚Äôt matter, and you get 3 Leaf Tickets no matter what for playing, so just have a good time! (Unless I get the best score, and then it matters in my tiny world.) For the first time though, Together! ka-BOOM Ticket Packs will be available if you are absolutely jonesing for more pyrotechnic minigame action. *~~(Not that you can just exit the app before it saves after playing the game to play infinitely‚Ä¶ But if that were possible, hypothetically, I‚Äôd be thanking sss333 for the tip right now.)~~* This minigame will be available for play December 30th GMT‚Äîif it‚Äôs available for more than one day, we‚Äôll have to find out then, but never a bad idea to play ASAP just in case.

* **January Seasonal Event ‚Äì New Year‚Äôs Festival**
   * It‚Äôs a new year, and that means new discoveries for the Farway Museum, including the newly discovered king stringfish found in the deepest and coldest winter streams‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to be a great year for scientific study! (Let‚Äôs just hope for Blathers‚Äôs sake we don‚Äôt discover king bugs‚Ä¶) To celebrate, the museum has put Blathers in charge of a cultural exhibition for the occasion complete with mementos, toys, and games honoring Japanese history! For January‚Äôs monthlong campaign, we‚Äôll be completing its gardening event (Blathers‚Äôs Piping Hot Food), fishing tourney (Foxy Caf√©), and scavenger hunt (Snowy Inn) to earn 30 New Year‚Äôs game paddles for a total of 90 game paddles regularly obtainable this month. Amass enough paddles to earn seasonal rewards like the decorated toy balls, the New Year‚Äôs spinning top, and the lion-dance mask. What‚Äôs that? You think it‚Äôs cheap the main prize is just a mask from Animal Crossing: New Leaf? Well, yes, but‚Äîyou see‚Ä¶ The museum‚Äôs funding is a little tight right now, what with January still being in the 2022 fiscal year and‚Ä¶ Anyway, even if that doesn‚Äôt suit your fancy, it‚Äôs still worth working towards all the other seasonal rewards, like Leaf Tickets and especially those coveted sparkle stones! Be sure to complete all three events in full so you don‚Äôt miss out on any of the 90 New Year‚Äôs game paddles. This scholarly cultural extravaganza begins with the Blathers‚Äôs Piping Hot Food gardening event December 30th GMT.

* **January Gardening Event ‚Äì Blathers‚Äôs Piping Hot Food**
   * Back when Blathers was earning his dual bachelor‚Äôs in archeology and art history, his late nights were fueled by hot bowls of instant ramen. And now that he‚Äôs curator of a local museum, on the coldest winter nights, he likes to warm up with the finest prepared soba, oden, and ramen in town‚Äîand share with any late-night visitors! For January‚Äôs gardening event, we‚Äôll be planting pink and white naruto seeds (yes, really) to attract delectable oden bees. Slurp up enough of these critters in your net to earn fixings for late-night food stalls where the most succulent noodles are served, from the spicy stock of the piping-hot ramen to the skewered cakes of the fresh steaming oden. All the local animals with a savory tooth will be staying up late to get a bite. Completing this event in full will yield 30 New Year‚Äôs game paddles as part of January‚Äôs monthlong New Year‚Äôs Festival campaign‚Äîbe sure to replant often and exchange oden bees with your friends to finish before the broth gets cold. Get to noodling around when the soba-sowing begins December 30th GMT, with Part 2 beginning January 3rd GMT.

&#x200B;

* **New Year Omikuji Gifts (2023)**
   * As with the New Year‚Äôs Omikuji Gifts of 2021, these gifts can be exchanged with your friends to reveal if your new year‚Äôs looking auspicious or even portentous with 20 fortune furniture pieces. (To anyone who‚Äôs going to try to collect them all again, you have my sympathies.) It appears these gifts will be distributed via log-in event beginning December 29th GMT.

* **Vibrant Kimono Collection**
   * O-no, no‚Äô-mo‚Äô kimonos‚Ä¶ This latest addition to Pocket Camp‚Äôs ever-growing mountain of kimonos will have you even more decked out for a traditional celebration than you already have been, but this time we have designs fashioned by and for some of our favorite villagers (and some we‚Äôre kind of indifferent to‚Ä¶) who wanted to try their paws, hooves, and wings at festive fashion. This collection includes Punchy‚Äôs stormy kimono, Goldie‚Äôs citrus kimono, Bunnie‚Äôs sunset kimono, Sasha‚Äôs aquamarine kimono, Flurry‚Äôs sky-blue kimono, Marshall‚Äôs lavender kimono, Judy‚Äôs cotton-candy kimono, Wolfgang‚Äôs midnight forest kimono, Roscoe‚Äôs lava rock kimono, and Phoebe‚Äôs fiery kimono. And while the in-game text doesn‚Äôt explicitly mention these animals, the filenames do reference them, so you‚Äôre sure to look extra-nice (and thematically appropriate) when you pair these patterns with the characters they‚Äôre based on. This collection also comes with bob wigs and clasp purses if you want to match further, as well as tortoise-shell and black retro glasses if you need to see better before you can clock the differences between these and previous kimono collections. Dedicate the next year of your life to an unsuspecting animal camper when this collection releases December 31st GMT.

* **Dobie‚Äôs Hot Spring Cookie**
   * Since cutting off his family and the rest of society, Dobie has lived as a somber lone wolf in the northern woods, but the solitary life in the cold, unfeeling wilderness takes its toll on an old mutt‚Äôs bones. When he comes upon a majestic bathhouse imbued with the power of great koi spirits, he fears he would have to breach his oath of isolation to experience the healing waters‚Ä¶ Are there attendants? Who keeps watch over this hot spring sanctuary? ‚ÄúIt does no good to tarnish the mind with the selfish ways of man and animal,‚Äù he says to himself. ‚ÄúIt is true that we enter this cruel world alone and we leave it in the same state, *ohmmm*... And yet, my spirit cries out to the world! It says, ‚ÄòI want a bath‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù Ready to forsake his celibacy for the pleasures of the body, he approaches ancient doors‚Ä¶ Yet he finds no workers, no keepers. Only a dish to deposit a few saved coins as he warms himself by the mini outdoor hot spring, admires the lifeless leaves of the graceful wintersweet tree, and finally soaks his world-weary bones in the 5-star outdoor hot-spring bath. ‚ÄúIt is truly a rare gift for such exquisite solace to be available to the lonely wanderer, *ohmmm*... I hope I don‚Äôt get arrested.‚Äù After many hours of soaking and drying off his fur, Dobie passes the village souvenir and manju shops, where all sorts of traditional trinkets and treats face him with a final temptation‚Ä¶ The payment dishes seem beckon the last of his Bells, which were savings for his hour of direst need. And yet‚Ä¶ there is no one here to judge him‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI must not allow myself to be swayed by the charms of material goods,‚Äù Dobie utters. ‚ÄúI am consigned to the simple life of a hermit, and yet‚Ä¶‚Äù His nape starts to sweat as his paws scramble for his coin pouch. ‚Äú**I WANT IT! I WANT IT ALL!!!!!**‚Äù Cross paths with the sacred springs and enticing wares of a stoic, unearthly bathhouse when this ascetic cookie appears at the new year on January 1st GMT.

* **Blathers‚Äôs Zen Bus Stop**
   * When an expedition beckons, Blathers often finds himself in distant lands waiting for public transport on his travels as he heads towards a groundbreaking dig site. But being nocturnal, he‚Äôs unfortunately prone to snoozing through his ride all day‚Ä¶ Thankfully, this harmonious coop makes for a cozy rest stop if he ends up stranded for an undetermined while. This special visitor furniture item will let Blathers pass the time at your campsite or cabin while he waits with some knowledgeable fact-filled chats to hoot, I mean boot, and will be available for purchase with Leaf Tickets starting January 2nd GMT.

&#x200B;

* **New Camper Design ‚Äì Groovy Zen Print**
   * A new camper paint job will be available at OK Motors January 3rd with a chipper peony color scheme and harmonious origami-and-blossom motifs, perfect for an airy tour into the new year‚Ä¶ for a modicum of Leaf Tickets, of course.

https://preview.redd.it/4093d5cnkx8a1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e6e777575ef073de341d0bc5792c64d2a48e250

&#x200B;

* **New Animals**
   * Ride into 2023 in style with a small batch of fashionable villagers (plus Pippy, for the year of the rabbit) to be served up by none other than Gulliver this month, including Pippy the peppy rabbit, Gigi the snooty frog, Ed the smug (previously jock) horse, and Baabara the snooty sheep. As always, their themes are not yet known, and their special request items are not confirmed but educated guesses by resident villager furniture scholar Soleil. Look for Ed and Pals‚Äô Island (or a similarly named island) when it‚Äôs added to the roster on Gulliver‚Äôs ship January 11th GMT.

[‚ÄúHi Li'l Hare, Camper, In totally unrelated news, I ran into Gulliver the other day at the Seashore. What's up with him? He was asleep on the beach and talking crazy about a giant squid. Weirdness, Pippy‚Äù -Pippy‚Äôs e-Reader scan letter; ‚ÄúGirlfriend! Camper, Get your self down here! Nook is having a sale and there is a parasol there that would look fabulous with your Crewel Shirt. I'm not lying! - Kiss kiss, Ed‚Äù -Ed‚Äôs e-Reader scan letter; ‚ÄúMy daahling, Camper, Do you know what I like about you? You're not afraid to be you. I wish I could run around dressed like that, but I have a reputation to maintain. I adore you!

&#x200B;

* **Still to Come for January / Miscellaneous**
   * Other upcoming items and events for this month include:
      * The zodiac rabbit, a New Year‚Äôs gift for all that will be distributed via the same log-in as the Omikuji Gifts.
      * **Zen Fox Outfit Collection** which will include pieces like fox ears and tails for you to embrace your inner kitsune, releasing January 10.
      * **Scallop Scoop-Up Goals** which it appears will see the return of the (until now) long-gone and sought after red, purple, and yellow scallop shells, collecting which will yield a Dobie‚Äôs hot spring cookie starting January 11.
      * **Foxy Caf√© Fishing Tourney** which will offer rewards for a cute peach-colored bistro where vulpine spirits are welcome, starting January 12.
      * **Zen Caf√© Wall & Floor Collection** which will likely have harmonious designs to go with the fishing trouney and Greta‚Äôs cookie, releasing January 13.
      * **Greta‚Äôs Bistro Cookie** which will offer pieces for a high-end Japanese restaurant, available January 18.
      * **Grouper Scooper Goals**, a ~~rerun~~ reprisal of January 2021‚Äôs goals of the same name with the longtooth grouper available with a Greta‚Äôs bistro cookie as a likely reward, starting January 19.
      * **Snowy Inn Scavenger Hunt** which will offer prizes for a cozy, snowed-inn Japanese lodge, starting January 20.
      * **Sliding Partition Collection** which will offer various Japanese dividers to apportion a harmonious home, releasing January 21.

That wraps up this New Year‚Äôs bash campers‚Äîstay tuned for the stickied comment for a couple extras. Well, how do you feel this bodes for 2023 in Pocket Camp? Are you tantalized by the festive foods and fare, or do you find yourself moaning at more harmoniousness? I‚Äôm hoping February or March shakes things up, but maybe one day I‚Äôll learn to adopt Dobie‚Äôs wisdom on the futility of being. Thanks as always for your patience as I‚Äôve been feeling (as usual) no so piping hot as Blather‚Äôs steamy soba. The next update will drop around the end of his flower-fueled feast, and until then, remember, if you quickly turn an olive flounder 180 degrees when handing it over, your campers will never notice the difference from the dab they asked for!

Divest Reviews: Read Dead Redemption 2,NonCredibleHistory,zl2uip,2022-12-13 13:24:36,30,0.85,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleHistory/comments/zl2uip/divest_reviews_read_dead_redemption_2/,AllBritsArePedos,,"RDR2 is garbage on basically every single level, very flashy garbage that clearly had a lot of effort put into it but garbage nonetheless. I‚Äôll try to avoid talking about the narrative or gameplay and instead focus on the history of the setting and what I think of that because that is a little bit more of a mixed bag but know that this game is horrible. I couldn‚Äôt immerse myself in the game world for a second because of how bad the gameplay was and how bad the story was.

I also enjoyed RDR1 a lot and RDR2 effectively squats on it and unloads its asshole over the entire thing, I am not as invested with any fantasy universe as your typical nerd so i‚Äôm not going to cry about how bad it is compared to RDR1 and I can just effective ignore everything in RDR2 and still enjoy RDR1 but that is still something that is going to feed into my negative opinion of this game.

Starting with the guns which is something I immediately noticed, when I played the first RDR I didn‚Äôt have an interest in guns and I was only 13 years old so I didn‚Äôt think much of it since it was set in 2011 but looking back on it most of the guns were way too old for the setting with a few of the modern ‚Äúdeath of the west‚Äù type guns actually fitting the setting.

RDR2 thanks to its schizophrenic design where they reused gun designs from RDR1, tries to make the guns more realistic and ends up making the game design worse and the guns generally less realistic, for a gameplay example using a .22 varmint rifle is too much firepower for shooting a squirrel and will destroy the carcass so you can‚Äôt skin it, Instead you have to shoot it with an untipped arrow. Untipped arrows and the varmint rifle will instantly kill any human you shoot with it if you hit them in the head, but it won‚Äôt kill a coyote if you shoot it in the head even though they have much weaker skulls.

As for the history of the guns most of them are bad, the game takes place in 1899 so all of the repeaters are very much outdated with the newest one being from 1866, these are guns that were also in RDR1 and didn‚Äôt fit, lever actions were still perfectly common weapons that were being updated at this time, the most advanced revolver in the game is from 1889 while the other two are from the 1870s, those are a bit more plausible due to the fact the older designs were still in production thanks to being cheaper to produce than double action designs which made them popular for people who wanted to carry a gun for self defense, but the vast majority of guns users in RDR2 are violent criminals or lawmen who would probably be better equipped than that since they rely on their guns in life or death situations on a daily basis.

The Scholfield revolver egregiously reloads slower and has more firepower than the Colt SAA in direct contradiction to its real life performance, in RDR1 it was just a straight upgrade over the SAA which was dumb but more forgivable than trying to find a niche for different weapons in the same class like in RDR2. All of those pistols would be outdated compared to the Colt 1899 that isn‚Äôt in the game but would have made a perfect late game revolver as it combined the double action revolver with the full .45 long colt bullet.

There are also a class of sidearms called pistols which are anything that isn‚Äôt a revolver including the volcanic pistol that has higher damage than most rifles despite shooting spit wads and being a super rare collector‚Äôs item. Unlike RDR1 where pistols were superior to revolvers but required more expensive ammunition the pistols in RDR2 are faster firing but do less damage despite the Borchart pistol firing a round that is deeper penetrating and delivers the same kinetic energy as .45 Long Colt while the Mauser C96 fires a significantly more powerful cartridge than the Borchart.

They also reused the Browning Automatic Shotgun from RDR1 but it‚Äôs too early for 1899, only entering production in 1902, Having both a Lever Action Winchester Shotgun and a Pump Action is also silly since the pump action had effectively replaced the lever action shotgun due to being simpler and cheaper to manufacture, another small gripe about the gameplay the stat page for the guns is so hard to read I had to google how they‚Äôre different, the pump action shotgun has slightly better accuracy but a slightly lower rate of fire, I don‚Äôt know how to quantify it though because the stats are measured in linear bars from 0-100.

Finally the rifles are all sorts of fucked up, there are rifles and sniper rifles like in RDR1 and they share ammo unlike RDR1, first off both of the regular rifles do not fit the setting, the Springfield Rifle and the Bolt Action Rifle are both American service weapons that would be currently in use in 1899 by the military (but the US Army in the game uses the 1860s era repeaters by the way.) and wouldn‚Äôt be available for private purchase, also when you go to a gunsmith he pretends like he is making the guns you buy when you very clearly buy them out of a catalog from any number of fictional firearms manufacturers.

The Sniper Rifles are totally redundant with the regular rifles, you can get a higher magnification scope from a sniper rifle then the regular rifles and they have better stats, in exchange you can‚Äôt aim down their iron sights to get aim assist lock on powers, the Carcano would also not be available as it would only be used by the Italian military at this point, for some stupid reason they decided to put the Lee Harvey Oswald‚Äôs rifle in RDR1 as a repeating sniper rifle and decided to keep it in RDR2.

Anyways a simple solution would be to just make the gameplay better and allow sniper rifles to ADS like all the other guns get rid of every rifle except the rolling block since that was the only one available for private purchase and put in a low capacity high powered lever action like the 1895 Winchester, Savage Model 99 or Marlin 1895 in the game to replace the Carcano and Springfield 1892. The 1895 Winchester and Rolling Block were both in use by the US Army in 1899 so they would fit for arming second rate troops garrisoned on the frontier much better than the Civil War era rifles.

The volcanic doesn‚Äôt really have a real world counterpart the closest I could think of would be a sawed off lever action called a mare‚Äôs leg but they wouldn‚Äôt have the 8 round capacity (because in reality you couldn‚Äôt make a tube fed magazine small enough for a pistol with all the firepower the volcanic has in game)

The pistols and revolvers are otherwise alrightish from a historical perspective though I wish they used later models of revolvers that were more fitting with the times, the only of the 3 repeaters I would keep is the Winchester 1866 since in reality it had a higher capacity than more modern lever actions since it used a smaller cartridge, 15 rounds versus the 9 of a 1894 Winchester.

I should remind you the gameplay sucks and part of that is that none of these weapon stats matter because all of the combat is trivially easy with Arthur being able to tank hundreds of bullets while every enemy dies in 1-2 shots regardless of weapon and placement.

The only weapon that does fit well is the Maxim gun, where in RDR1 they used Browning M1917 machine guns in 1911 and Civil War era gatling guns that should be in the museum with the volcanic, Maxim guns fit the setting perfectly along with the Borchart, C96, rolling block and pump action shotgun.

The Last weapon related thing I can think of is that in one of the detours they take you through has the Van Der Linde Gang sinking a Cuban Monitor that looks like it would be better set in the American Civil War since it doesn‚Äôt even have turrets.

Next I think we should talk about how fucked the geography is. The State of New Hannover has more jarring biome changes than a game of minecraft, you can suddenly go from Arkansas to North Dakota just on your way to find a barber. The equivalent to Louisiana is located farther north than their equivalent to the Southern Rocky Mountains. The Gulf of Mexico is a freshwater body called the Lannahechee River with an invisible land mass on the other side, but also you‚Äôre able to sail a ship to Cuba from Saint Denis. Dutch thinks that if they went East of Louisiana they would end up in the Atlantic Ocean.

Sockeye Salmon only live in the pacific ocean and rivers in the pacific northwest, you can actually find them in ponds in RDR2

So now the first historical inaccuracy I should mention is that Cuba didn‚Äôt exist as an independent state with a military or Navy until 1902, when this game takes place in 1899. Arthur and the gang end up marooned on an Island of Cuba that serves as a major sugar plantation that is in a state of civil war. I think the implication is supposed to be that the Kingdom of Spain and the Cuban colony was a socialist paradise and the US overthrew it and replaced it with a capitalist state.

They also pretend like the Civil War Happened a month before the game took place, there‚Äôs a Civil War Battleground next to New Orleans even though they surrendered without a fight and there‚Äôs an entire gang of Civil War veterans who would all be in their 60s by this point if they had fought, not to mention the fact the Confederates never had standard Gray Uniforms because they were totally incapable.

I think the most authentic part of Red Dead Redemption 2 and the part everyone can agree makes it the most realistic and best made Old West piece of media ever is the fact that they have a clan of inbred cannibals numbering in the hundreds that live in the caves, mutilating, raping and eating people who pass through their territory, actually I just remembered there are two groups like this with the others living in the swamps of louisiana.

At first I thought that the game was pretty cool because they were talking about the death of the old west and they showed things like having an Italian Crime lord who lived in affluence rather than bandit cowboys running small time scams and emphasis was placed on the burgeoning oil industry but these just served to create some two dimensional villains for Arthur and the Gang to kill off.

Anyways a big part of RDR1 was to give you an ambiguous story about a conflict between the government and outlaws with the player character being a former outlaw who was betrayed by a Joseph Stalin lookalike who gives long winded speeches about why intellectuals are evil, kills hostages and robs banks through a gang of Indian Beta males he riled up.

In RDR2 now the parallels aren‚Äôt about the cold war but the war on Terror, the Elk People are now Wahabi Jihadists who are actually defending their land from Americans stealing their oil, their leader (the sioux didn‚Äôt have a king or leader they were a confederation) is a wise peace loving chief who constantly refuses to be provoked by the evil white man and is encroached

He‚Äôs based on a real life Lakota Chief named Red Cloud who raped and pillaged Crow settlements that were under the protection of the US Army at the time and then ambushed a company of cavalry scouts who patrolled the area, then the US called for a ceasefire and took Red Cloud to Washington DC where he realized that the Lakota were so outmatched they would just get wiped out in a war and became a man of peace afterwards.

The narrative goes that by placating Red Cloud by conceding land to the Lakota the US was actually betraying the Crow, clearly the US should have just murdered all of the Lakota so that the Crow could retain the land rather than introduce agriculture to the plains so that the Indians wouldn‚Äôt have to fight over hunting grounds.

Anyways beyond that the Elk People have had all their women and children kidnapped and sent to boarding schools by the Army, but also in a later mission we see that there is a plague spreading through the reservation killing the women and children and Arthur has to steal a vaccine that was denied to them even though vaccines don‚Äôt work on people who are already infected with a disease.

The Indians have a cure for tuberculosis made of wild herbs so why would they even need the white man‚Äôs vaccine when they clearly have the most advanced medicine on the planet since it would take another 50 years for anyone to discover antibiotics for curing TB.

One of the main characters has a black father and a plain indian mother. I think the fact they couldn‚Äôt find a black indian to voice him like the red indians who voice the Elk People, instead they got an Asian-American who is half Parsi and half Japanese should tell you that these black indians aren‚Äôt common. The only case I could find of a half black plains indian was a Seminole slave (one of the 5 civilized tribes) who was sold to the Kiowa at a young age.

The Elk People in RDR2 also moved to Canada which is a refuge for Indians in this universe (because the game was made by Canadians) In reality Sitting Bull fled to Canada where they were given legal refuge from the crimes they committed against the Crow because Great Britain was the predecessor to the Soviet Union and China, constantly trying to sabotage the US by bedding down with any criminal element they could get to work for them. But of course the Canadians didn‚Äôt actually care about helping the Lakota ([unless they could drive them out into the wilderness and freeze them to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_freezing_deaths)) so they were starving because they didn‚Äôt get the food aid from the US and the buffalo herds of Canada couldn‚Äôt support them so Sitting Bull turned around after a few years and headed back to the US rather than permanently residing in Canada like this game implies.

The gang gaslights the only gang member who fought in the Indian wars when he attempts to discuss the atrocities he witnessed the Indians commit. Similar to how lefties love to talk over and talk down to people who actually understand the conflict in Iraq or witnessed it firsthand. Also just to remind you about how soldiers are all inferior to the Leftists in this universe the only sympathetic soldier is driven out of the army because his commanding officer is jealous of him graduating from west point, also the gang veteran is a homosexual and we‚Äôre constantly reminded of how stupid he is compared to everyone else (who acts like a moron because of the poor writing in this game) He‚Äôs also racist and no one respects him because no one could just criticize the behavior of the Indians who went to war with the US.

Also this character is Bill Williamson, who ran the largest gang in New Austin in RDR1 because he‚Äôs so stupid and incompetent.

While this game likes to waste so much time talking about a fictional version of the conflict between America and the Sioux they also managed to make a mockery of the history of the American Jew while they were at it, the only two Jewish characters in the game are a useless and pathetic man who is less masculine than his wife and died before the game started to some pathetic lowlifes raiding his ranch before they took turns raping his wife. His aryan wife was only tricked into loving him because he was sweet to her too which obviously turned her into a hysterical madwoman after his death.

On the other hand you have the unscrupulous Jew who was born into dirt poverty in the old country and came to the new world as a land of opportunity. The only problem is that he is perverting the country because he became a greedy loan shark who exploits the desperation of destitute goyim because he doesn‚Äôt see them as human beings. He‚Äôs also physically incapable and only good for doing math, relying on the physically superior Rural Aryan boys he‚Äôs working with to collect interest on his usurious loans and eventually he wears out his welcome with them too thanks to his complete lack of empathy.

Their treatment of other races is okay, I think almost all the Mexicans except for a nun were criminals but they also had a diverse range of asian and latin people in Saint Denis some non-Jewish G\*rmans populate the state of New Hannover and aren‚Äôt treated as subhumans. They treat all the Cubans like vicious mercenaries though because they‚Äôre not Soviet puppets yet. They also make a particular emphasis on the background of the main characters (other than when they‚Äôre pussyfooting around Jews to avoid ostracizing the antisemites) Arthur is Welsh, John is from a Scottish background, there‚Äôs a couple of Irish and Scottish members.

The name Dutch is stupid though it literally means G\*rman despite them repeatedly emphasizing he is a Netherlander with a Netherlandish name and his preference for the color orange. They even have an ethnic group in his home state of Pennsylvania called Pennsylvania Dutch who are an enclave of Anabaptists who speak a G\*rman dialect. No Netherlander would name their child Dutch unless they wanted him to be confused with those anabaptists, also it's very unlikely that he would have dark black hair if he was a Netherlander as their population mostly consists of light haired northern Europeans like Scandinavians and Germanics.

Finally the pigs in RDR2 are all tiny compared to their real life counterparts who on average would weigh around 220kg for females and more for the males, these look to be juveniles. Also they differentiate between castrated male cattle and intact male cattle by naming them ‚Äúbull‚Äù and ‚ÄúOxen‚Äù instead of bulls and steers, despite all 3 breeds being beef cattle unsuited for draught work and the fact that Oxen are gender neutral.

I gave up on this game when I first played it long before I completed the story because it was so bad and I couldn't even finish watching a playthrough of the game because it was just so long and boring. So I am probably missing out on a ton of stuff. I just couldn't take it when the super forgettable Pinkerton bad guy awkwardly tells you who betrayed you for no reason."

Impressive Fishing Accomplishments,sportsbet,xtxbmb,2022-10-02 15:22:57,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbet/comments/xtxbmb/impressive_fishing_accomplishments/,CrucialLogic,,"Hi All,

The world of fishing is rich and varied, while many trawlers battle the high seas to bring food to tables in many countries, it is also considered a fantastic sport by many people. It can be very therapeutic sitting beside a lake and waiting for a tug on the line, or you might got slight more high adventurous on a personal leisure boat. Whether you're doing it for sustenance and others like the catch & release, it is a skill honed over much practice. Now is a chance to look at some of the astounding records pulled off over the ages.

**The largest fish ever caught on rod and line**

All the way back in 1959, off the coast of Ceduna, South Australia an angler by the name of Alfred Dean managed to reel in a great white shark weighing a total of 2,664 lb (1,208kg). The weight was confirmed after he hooked the shark at twelve miles out and spent seventy minutes wrestling it in. He even claimed to have hooked one estimated at a weight of 4,000 lb a few years earlier but it got away.

**Most fish caught within 24 hours**

This one is a hard one to pin down as there are a few different competing claims, however a Jeff Kolodzinki spent a whole day fishing in a Minnesota pond and managed to catch 2,649 fish with a 10-foot pole rigged with a simple float. He has actually set many other fishing related records and regularly tries to improve on this record.

**Quickest reel of a monster size Yellowfin Tuna**

The very thought of fighting with a tuna is enough to make any fisherman ache, due to the tremendous battle they put up. However an experienced angler named Curt Wiesenhutter was able to bring one weighing 388.5 pounds in only 120 seconds.

**Longest fish fight ever recorded**

In 1999 Tommy Resha of Birmingham, Alabama was able to hook a powerful Marlin while fishing off Key Largo in Florida. Weighing at estimate 1,200 to 1,800 pounds it started a battle that tested the 100-pound line, 400-pound test leader to the limit. The whole fight went on for 32 hours 40 minutes. Even after all that time and getting the fish close to the boat, eventually the line gave way and they ended up chasing the fish for another 25 miles."

We are back and delighted to engage with our fellow Redditors.

It‚Äôs that time again for our monthly recap and discussion post.

The big talk of the month was The Merge of ETH and the shift from a Proof- of- work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof- of- stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

PoW and PoS advocates within the crypto community often debate each method‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses around network security, scalability, and decentralization. You can read our full report [here](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/58b6xidjxk44xedc), and let us know all your thoughts for our monthly discussion.
