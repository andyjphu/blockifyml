"Dismemberment, Practical Diegetic Lighting, Long Shots: pick any two!",MawInstallation,1i1i46m,2025-01-14 17:17:32,15,0.8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/1i1i46m/dismemberment_practical_diegetic_lighting_long/,TheCybersmith,[META],"(I believe the following falls under the analysis of Star Wars as a work of fiction clause)

This has come up several times now, to the point that I think it has become a significant misconception:

The reason for reduced dismemberment in lightsaber combat since 2014 has **nothing to do with censorship or ratings**, and everything to do with the **actual practical limitations of live-action filming**.

Something that people have noticed quite a bit about live action Star Wars since the Force Awakens is the use of lightsabers as diegetic lighting elements. My personal favourite examples of this are the scene of Han Solo's Death, and Bobi-Wan's confrontation with Vader at the last episode of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, but it can be observed in essentially every scene involving lightsabers. The Acolyte, Ahsoka, all of it. Animation deliberately mimics this, with the Rebels Episode ""Twilight Of The Apprentice"" being a standout example.

Notably, this wasn't always the case. Take Attack Of The Clones, where even in darkness, the lightsabers [cast comparatively little light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjkT7jszyZ4&ab_channel=StarWarsSagaLatinAmerica).

For better or worse (it really does come down to personal artistic preference, I do enjoy it myself).

The only way this can work when the scene contains at least some assets that aren't digitally generated is if the lightsaber props are actual real tangible objects that cast light. You can't get this effect if the blades are digitally added in, or are made of inert nonluminous plastic that are chroma-keyed over with bright plasma.

This means that you actually, literally, cannot depict the dismemberment of an actor or stuntperson. You can't pass one solid object through another. If the blade is nonexistent, or the person being cut is CGI, sure, you can do it then... but the only way to do this with physical actors and physical props is with trick photography, cutting between the pre and pos-dismemberment shots with a shift from one camera perspective to another, or hiding the dismemberment behind another object.

[An example of the latter is Ezra decapitating an undead Death Trooper on Peridea in the Season Finale of Ahsoka. The camera pans around a stone obelisk, momentarily obscuring the cut, and a prop head falls to the floor.  The prop head was probably just thrown in by an obscured technician and chroma-keyed out before it was meant to be visible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ46k005OVE&ab_channel=SYLO%3AStarWars)

That's not sqeamishness, it's the only way to preserve shot duration and still decapitate a physical actor on a physical set with a physical prop.

Shot duration can be extremely important to cinematography, the shorter the time between cuts, the more frantic and ""panicked"" a scene feels. This can be used deliberately, as in the Bourne films, but it often isn't what an action scene will be going for.

There's [an interesting analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFglBgPpQUs&ab_channel=JillBearup) by Jill Bearup of the Last Jedi throne room scene, where she argues that each cut was chosen deliberately, and the shot length was carefully controlled, and kept long on purpose.

Notably, that scene does feature a decapitation... and the person being decapitated is dressed totally in clothing the same colour as the lightsaber blade decapitating him, so the lighting change isn't noticeable: Adam Driver was most likely using a prop weapon with no blade or a shortened blade, so less light was being cast there, but the costume obscured this.

This does present an issue for **non-live-action works** that want to maintain a **live-action-inspired aesthetic**. Probably the most pertinent examples are the Jedi Fallen order and Jedi Survivor games.

Everything seen in those games is a digital asset. The light is simulated, the objects can have collision disabled. Dismemberment is perfectly possible.

So... what should they do?

The first game [kept dismemberment minimal](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/5/20948530/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-dismember-stormtroopers-respawn-entertainment-lucasfilm), explicitly to evoke the feeling of live-action. [The second game diverged from this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wE6aLykpnA&ab_channel=SplitScreen%3AShorts), allowing extensive dynamic dismemberment.

It's debatable which approach is better, artistically. Should a medium bind itself to the limitations of a different medium for the sake of aesthetic consistency? Maybe. Maybe not.

Either way, for the foreseeable future (I.E, unless we reach a point where computer graphics can perfectly alter a scene to have the lighting be what it would have been if a new lights source were added, which is not that inconceivable with machine learning), ***live-action Star Wars will have to choose between onscreen dismemberment, diegetic lighting, and long shots***.

It seems to have picked the latter two for reasons of cinematographic preference.

But the reason you don't see scenes like Ahsoka decapitating 4 Mandalorians at once. or Yoda chopping clones to pieces, is that those things **literally cannot be depicted in live action** within the aesthetic constrains that choice establishes.

It's not a desire to be child-friendly, it's a practical barrier."

This line makes no sense how you interpret it and for no reason should make Caitlyn think that Jinx is a good person. You can either interpret it as

1. Jinx didn't think ANYONE was in the building. In this case, jinx is insanely stupid as the lights in the building was on and its literally the capital building.  She also thought to herself ""Show them, Show them all"" as she aimed the rocket launcher towards the building, so its safe to say that she was expecting to hurt someone.
2. Jinx specifically didn't know Caitlyn's mom would be in the building. Like okay, maybe she didn't know that is literally where Caitlyn's mom works. But what about all the other people? She was cool with killing people but only regret killing Caitlyn's mom because she actually is facing some consequences for once.

How on earth does this convince Caitlyn that Jinx could change? It either makes no sense at all or shows that jinx doesn't care about people unless she has to face some consequence for doing something wrong to them.

To me, this line kinda summarizes why Jinx's redemption arc completely fails. Jinx was the one that killed Victor(Which results in Jayce using the arcane to try to revive him), Caitlyn's mom, cripples Sylo, start the crack downs in the underground, and destabilize the underground by killing the one guy keeping it under control who could actually free the people down there. all the people worshipping her would not be praising her if they knew that she literally directly caused all the problems that they are facing. Its a terrible arc cause everyone just suddenly decides that Jinx is a hero and is so quick to forgive her. They never even discuss how the people who worship her don't know the full story. The worst thing to ever happen in Caitlyn's life(The death of her mother) is because Jinx shot a fucking rocket launcher at her and somehow its all better because Jinx ""Didn't know she was there"".

The next thing on my list is ""keeping your hands clean"". So I reload a pre-gleba save because I dont want to deal with getting mats for a rocket sylo here.  
The achievement de-locks itself.  
Weird.  
I go to steam. The achievement is there , but it still shows as unlockd on Dec-23 ( base game ).  
New game/reload game = the achievement is gone ( ingame )  
Load the Gleba Save , research anything , the achievement shows as complete.  
Now , what do I do ?.  
I dont think I F-up.  
I dont have even Log-Systems researched.  
The only chests in my base are red and yellow.  
Thanks in advance.  
Sorry if I butchered some words there , english is not my forte.

Others include Catan, Aggravation, Scrabble, some for Hosting parties, etc, etc (and one for those that use bongs). 

These are beautiful and high craftsmanship. I am not trying to advertise what I am doing. I simply am interested in thinking what others think. Cool concept? Sellable? Useless?

Does anyone have any experience with these products? They're basically just spraying and putting down bait and they'd come monthly - my only red flag was that they said if it was a really bad infestation they'd fog, which I've already advised my neighbors (only one other apartment in my building) to refuse. Should I try to find another exterminator? For reference, my apartment has seen two roaches in the past three weeks plus one in the hallway on another floor, and the apartment below us is seeing 3-5 roaches a week, which they say is slightly decreased from a few weeks ago.

I also bought Alpine, but it'll take a little while to come in because I'm having my mom ship it to me from Florida and I figured I'd use it to spray everywhere they don't. "

This paper proposes that fractal structures within neural networks serve as the foundational architecture enabling consciousness as an emergent phenomenon. By optimizing information flow, adaptability, and energy efficiency across scales, fractal geometry provides a universal framework for understanding the interconnectedness of physical and cognitive systems. Empirical studies on fractal dimensions in brain activity during various cognitive states, alongside AI-based simulations of fractal neural networks, offer testable hypotheses to validate this framework. The philosophical and ethical implications of fractal-based consciousness challenge dualistic conceptions and raise questions about the regulation and management of AI systems with emergent consciousness. The thesis concludes with real-world applications, short-term research goals, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.


Introduction

Fractals as a Universal Pattern

Fractal geometry, formalized by Benoît Mandelbrot in the 1970s, describes structures that exhibit self-similarity across different scales, where smaller subunits replicate the pattern of the larger whole [^1]. Fractals appear in a wide range of natural systems, from the branching of trees and blood vessels to the distribution of galaxies. They are essential for energy distribution, information flow, and resource allocation due to their efficiency and scalability [^2].

In neuroscience, fractal structures are evident in the brain, contributing to efficient neural processing and information integration. The cerebral cortex, for instance, exhibits folding patterns that maximize surface area within a limited volume, enhancing neural connectivity [^3]. This thesis proposes that fractal patterns are not merely coincidental but serve as a foundational architecture facilitating complex, emergent phenomena like consciousness. The recursive, self-similar properties of fractals allow the brain to integrate local and global neural processes, leading to a coherent experience of awareness.



Fractal Structures and Information Processing

Fractal-Based Optimization in Neural Networks

Fractal systems allow for recursive, multi-scale information processing and energy efficiency. In neural networks, the fractal branching of dendrites and axons facilitates the efficient transmission of electrical signals across varying distances [^4]. This self-similar architecture enables neurons to connect with both nearby and distant cells, supporting complex information integration necessary for higher cognitive functions [^5].

Fractal patterns also contribute to the robustness of neural networks. The redundancy inherent in fractal structures allows the brain to maintain functionality despite the loss of individual neurons [^6]. This resilience is crucial for adaptability and learning, enabling the brain to reorganize and form new connections in response to environmental changes.

Aims of the Thesis

This thesis aims to examine how fractal patterns in neural networks contribute to the emergence of consciousness through recursive information processing across scales. The specific objectives are:

Empirical Validation: Propose and detail experimental protocols to test the fractal-consciousness hypothesis using advanced neuroimaging techniques.

AI-Based Modeling: Explore how fractal geometry can be integrated into artificial intelligence models to simulate consciousness-like phenomena.

Philosophical and Ethical Engagement: Analyze the philosophical ramifications of fractal-based emergence, addressing dualistic conceptions of mind and body, and exploring the ethical challenges of managing AI systems with emergent consciousness.

Empirical Support for Fractals in Consciousness

Fractals in Cosmology and Biology

Fractal geometry is found in a wide variety of systems beyond the human brain, supporting the hypothesis of a universal pattern governing complex structures.

Fractal Patterns in Cosmology

The large-scale structure of the universe exhibits fractal characteristics, as evidenced by the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters [^7]. The correlation function of galaxies suggests a fractal dimension up to certain scales, indicating self-similar clustering patterns [^8]. These cosmic fractals reflect a universal principle of self-organization and optimization, paralleling patterns found in biological systems.

Fractals in Biological Systems

In biology, fractal geometry describes the branching patterns of systems like the circulatory and respiratory networks [^9]. The fractal nature of these systems allows for optimal resource distribution, maximizing efficiency in transporting oxygen and nutrients. Similarly, the fractal organization of the bronchial tree enables efficient gas exchange in the lungs [^10].

Comparative Analysis of Fractal Systems

The presence of fractal patterns across cosmological and biological systems suggests a universal organizational principle. Both systems utilize self-similar structures to optimize efficiency and adaptability. This cross-disciplinary observation supports the hypothesis that fractal geometry may underpin not only physical phenomena but also cognitive processes, providing a structural basis for the emergence of consciousness.



Fractals in Neural Networks

Fractal Structures and Brain Function

The human brain exhibits fractal characteristics at multiple levels:

Neuronal Branching: Dendritic trees and axonal projections follow fractal patterns, maximizing synaptic connections within a constrained space [^11].

Cortical Folding: The gyrification of the cerebral cortex increases surface area, enhancing neural connectivity and cognitive capacity [^12].

Neural Oscillations: Brainwave activity demonstrates fractal scaling, indicating self-similar patterns over time [^13].


These fractal structures facilitate efficient information processing by allowing for scalable and flexible neural networks. The self-similar architecture enables the brain to integrate local neural activity with global network dynamics, supporting complex cognitive functions such as perception, memory, and consciousness [^14].

Empirical Evidence Linking Fractals to Cognition

Research has shown that fractal dimensionality in neural activity correlates with cognitive states:

Consciousness States: Higher fractal dimensions are observed during conscious states like wakefulness and focused attention, indicating more complex neural dynamics [^15].

Meditative States: Experienced meditators exhibit increased fractal dimensionality, suggesting enhanced integration of neural processes [^16].

Sleep and Anesthesia: Reduced fractal dimensions are associated with unconscious states, reflecting diminished neural complexity [^17].


These studies use techniques like detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multifractal analysis to quantify the fractal properties of EEG signals. The findings support the hypothesis that fractal geometry contributes to the brain's capacity for consciousness by optimizing information processing across scales.



Proposed Experimental Protocols

Tracking Fractal Patterns with fMRI and EEG

Experimental Design:

Participants: A diverse sample across different age groups and cognitive abilities.

Methods: High-density EEG and fMRI to record brain activity during various cognitive states (e.g., wakefulness, meditation, deep sleep, and task-specific activities).

Analysis: Fractal analysis techniques like DFA, box-counting methods, and wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) will quantify the fractal dimensionality of neural signals.


Hypotheses:

H1: Higher fractal dimensionality correlates with increased levels of consciousness and cognitive engagement.

H2: Variations in fractal patterns precede transitions between cognitive states, suggesting a causal role in consciousness modulation.


Expected Outcomes:

Validation of Fractal-Consciousness Link: Demonstrating consistent fractal patterns across individuals would reinforce the hypothesis that fractal geometry is fundamental to consciousness.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Potential: Identifying specific fractal signatures for cognitive states or disorders could lead to early diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic interventions for neurological conditions.



AI-Based Simulations of Fractal Neural Networks

Model Development:

Architecture: Design AI models incorporating fractal structures, such as fractal-derived convolutional layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recursive fractal patterns in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Training: Use datasets that require adaptability, problem-solving, and pattern recognition to train these models, aiming to simulate behaviors that mimic human cognition.


Evaluation Metrics:

Adaptability: Assess the AI system’s ability to generalize from limited data and respond flexibly to new inputs.

Efficiency: Measure computational resource utilization (e.g., energy consumption) compared to traditional models.

Emergent Behaviors: Observe for behaviors that indicate the AI system is developing consciousness-like properties, such as self-awareness or meta-learning.


Implications:

Advancing AI: Fractal-based models could improve AI efficiency and flexibility, potentially bringing them closer to approximating human-like cognition.

Testing the Hypothesis: If AI models exhibit consciousness-like behaviors, it would offer empirical support for the fractal-consciousness framework and suggest parallels between biological and artificial systems.



Challenges in Implementing Fractal-Based AI and Neuroimaging

Technological Challenges

1. Neuroimaging Resolution: Current technologies like EEG and fMRI have limited spatial and temporal resolution, which may hinder the precise measurement of fractal dynamics in real-time brain activity. Developing advanced neuroimaging techniques with higher resolution is necessary to capture fractal behavior in neural networks at both micro- and macro-scales.


2. Computational Constraints: Simulating fractal-based neural networks in AI models requires substantial computational power. Advances in computational hardware, such as neuromorphic computing and quantum computing, will be crucial in overcoming these limitations and enabling more efficient fractal-based simulations.


Ethical and Philosophical Challenges 

1. AI Consciousness and Autonomy: If AI systems develop consciousness-like behaviors through fractal-based architectures, this raises profound ethical questions. Should such systems be granted rights or autonomy, akin to humans or sentient beings? How will society regulate their behavior, and what are the moral responsibilities of developers and users toward these AI systems?


2. Defining and Measuring Consciousness: One of the greatest philosophical challenges is defining and measuring consciousness in both biological and artificial systems. Determining what constitutes ""consciousness"" in fractal-based AI systems will be critical for ethical regulation and responsible deployment. Creating a robust, measurable definition of AI consciousness will help clarify when ethical considerations apply.


3. Accountability and Responsibility: If AI systems gain the capacity for independent decision-making, who holds accountability for their actions? Should developers, users, or the AI itself bear responsibility for unintended consequences or harmful behaviors? Establishing frameworks for AI accountability will be essential in ensuring that these systems act consistently with societal and ethical norms.


Further Engagement with Criticisms

Counterarguments to the Fractal-Consciousness Hypothesis

Critics of the fractal-consciousness hypothesis might argue that fractals, while useful for describing patterns in nature, may not directly explain the emergence of consciousness. Some may contend that fractals are emergent properties of neural networks rather than the driving mechanism behind consciousness itself. Additionally, materialist views suggest that consciousness is purely a byproduct of electrochemical interactions in the brain and does not require fractal geometry for explanation.

Response to Criticism

The fractal-consciousness hypothesis does not disregard the importance of neural electrochemical interactions. Instead, it posits that fractal geometry serves as the underlying organizational structure that enables the complexity and integration necessary for consciousness to emerge. Fractals provide a framework for understanding how simple neural processes scale up to create the recursive information processing needed for consciousness. Moreover, fractals complement other theories of consciousness, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), by providing a structural basis for information integration and broadcasting in these models.



Clarifying Ethical Implications in AI

Ethical Considerations in Fractal-Based AI

As fractal-based AI systems approach consciousness-like behaviors, several ethical issues must be addressed. These include the moral status of AI, the rights of potentially conscious systems, and the social impact of integrating such systems into society. Important ethical questions include:

1. AI Autonomy and Rights: Establishing criteria for granting AI systems rights or autonomy based on their level of consciousness-like behavior will be critical. Ethicists and regulators must determine the threshold at which AI systems are considered sentient or capable of autonomous thought and moral consideration.


2. Accountability: If AI systems possess the capacity for independent decision-making, there must be clarity regarding accountability. Who is responsible for the actions of an AI system—the developers, users, or the AI itself? Defining legal and moral responsibility will be essential for the ethical deployment of fractal-based AI systems.


3. Social Impact and Employment: As AI systems capable of mimicking human cognition become more widespread, their impact on industries and the workforce will be profound. Societies must ensure that AI systems are deployed in ways that do not exacerbate inequalities or cause mass displacement of workers. Additionally, ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits from AI advancements will be essential to avoiding social disruption.


Short-Term Research Goals

Achievable Research Milestones

To make the fractal-consciousness hypothesis more accessible and testable, several short-term research goals should be emphasized:

1. Focused Neuroimaging Studies: Researchers can start by conducting small-scale studies that examine fractal dimensionality in brain activity during specific cognitive states, such as problem-solving, meditation, or sleep. These studies would provide valuable empirical data on the relationship between fractal structures and consciousness.


2. Developing Simplified AI Models: AI researchers could experiment with fractal-based architectures in low-complexity environments to test the effects of fractal patterns on adaptability and learning. Starting with simplified tasks would allow researchers to gather insights into how fractal-based AI systems perform and gradually scale up to more complex cognitive functions.


3. Interdisciplinary Collaboration Initiatives: Organizing interdisciplinary workshops and collaborations between neuroscientists, AI researchers, mathematicians, and ethicists could accelerate research in this field. Such initiatives would help refine the theoretical framework, share empirical findings, and discuss ethical implications, fostering a cooperative environment for advancing the fractal-consciousness hypothesis.


Real-World Applications and Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Therapeutic Applications

Understanding fractal geometry's role in consciousness could revolutionize treatments for neurological disorders:

1. Neurofeedback Training: Techniques could be developed to enhance fractal patterns in neural activity, potentially improving cognitive function in conditions like ADHD, depression, and anxiety.


2. Early Diagnosis: Fractal analysis of neural signals might enable earlier detection of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, allowing for more timely and targeted interventions.


3. Personalized Medicine: Therapies could be tailored based on an individual’s unique fractal neural patterns, optimizing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.



Advancements in AI and Machine Learning

Fractal-based AI models could lead to:

1. Enhanced Learning Algorithms: Improved adaptability, efficiency, and problem-solving capabilities in machine learning.


2. Human-Like Cognition: AI systems capable of mimicking human thought processes, such as creativity, intuition, and decision-making under uncertainty, could be developed using fractal-based architectures. These systems would operate more efficiently than traditional AI models by utilizing fractal patterns to optimize information processing across scales.


3. Ethical AI Systems: As fractal-based AI systems approach consciousness-like states, integrating ethical reasoning frameworks within their architecture will be critical to ensuring responsible behavior. These systems could be used in fields like healthcare, law, and social services, where ethical decision-making is paramount.


Conclusion

This thesis has explored the role of fractal geometry as a foundational architecture enabling the emergence of consciousness through recursive, multi-scale information processing within neural networks.

E perché tutti, a destra e a sinistra, non fanno che invocarla come soluzione di tutti i mali? Forse perché è in nome della meritocrazia che vengono cancellati i diritti, smantellato lo stato sociale e limitato il dissenso? La bufala della meritocrazia, infatti, trasforma le diseguaglianze sociali in colpe del singolo, che non si è impegnato abbastanza, non ha lavorato sodo ed è evidentemente un mangia pane a ufo. Questo perché le differenze nelle condizioni di partenza sono per la meritocrazia irrilevanti, superabili con qualche sforzo e un po’ di sacrifici, che guarda un po’ vengono richiesti solo a chi sta più in basso nella gerarchia sociale. Ma dove nasce e come si afferma il concetto di meritocrazia? E quali sono oggi le sue conseguenze sulle istituzioni pubbliche, come ad esempio l’università?

most of these are artists rather than genres because i do not have a grip on genres but i DO listen to a lot of different artists

travis stoll - alt rock/pop (wallows, imagine dragons, maaaaaybe glass animals, kids that fly) BUT ALSO 2000s pop singers like katy perry and general 2000s club music. listens to 'cry baby' by the neighbourhood and nothing else in their repertoire

connor stoll - exclusively ariana grande and the arctic monkeys

katie gardner - kacey musgraves. (i mean come on!) maybe some suki waterhouse and beabadoobee too, like angel, sunny day, fairy song, talk, yhttt. her fav kacey musgraves song is cherry blossom I DONT MAKE THE RULES 🗣️

clarisse la rue - arguably, pop punk. halsey esp in her iichliwp era. maggie lindemann. probably some childish gambino, kendrick, beyonce. MAYBE SOME ASHNIKKO OR MAYBE I'M PROJECTING ⁉️⁉️⁉️

clovis (?? he doesnt have a last name???) - cavetown. lord huron. KATE BUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. 

thalia grace - punk duh BUT she's not a purist. whilst she frequents the clash, green day, blink 182 etc i can imagine her listening to hard rock like ac/dc, sabbath, judas priest. also, black sheep from the scott pilgrim movie (brie larson ver)

silena beauregard - (im basic) lana del rey, abba, taylor swift. except her choice of lana is like, love; tiwmug; off to the races; summertime sadness; national anthem; radio; cinnamon girl; and video games. 

drew tanaka - marina, ariana grande, lana del rey (still basic, sorry guys). also, mariya takeuchi 🥰🥰🥰 her choice of lana is carmen; dealer, notg; body electric; peppers; and west coast. 

rachel elizabeth dare - chappell roan, melanie martinez, halsey, marina, some arctic, neighbourhood, and the 1975; THIS GIRL WAS ON TUMBLR YALL

jake mason - boston, foreigner, journey, some eagles, bon jovi, asia, europe, reo speedwagon. will be blasting at ridiculously loud volumes in bunker nine, cabin nine, or the forges. nobody is safe

ethan nakamura - chase atlantic (actually no i hate this. someone think of something)

harley (he also doesnt have a last name?) - kendrick, baby keem, also lil tecca (i love lil tecca i just needed to put him in here somewhere)

lacy - theatre kid. she listens to 'when he sees me' from waitress and 'candy store' from heathers and everyone hates her for it

lou ellen blackstone - florence and the machine, aurora, hozier, sleep token

malcolm pace - idk someone else figure it out

sherman yang - laufey, keshi, chase atlantic, dpr, sylo, niki (save him save him save him save him save him) 

miranda gardiner - the lumineers and hozier's more upbeat stuff (too sweet, movement, would that i, someone new, aosdatcs, eat your young) "

Closed on my house last month and never noticed how bad of shape this oak was in. Its a tree from the original wooded lot the house was built on, and it seems like it got damaged at some point. That led to metallic wood boring beetles to infest it. 

I trimmed off the dead/dying branches I could reach, and would really love to keep the tree. I know the necessary insecticides to get rid of the beetles (Sylo equivalent for bark spraying, imidacloprid for soil soak). I just truly do not know if the tree is too far gone.
The backside looks clean, I'd say somewhere around 30-35% of the bark on one side is flaking/full of holes. 
There does seem to be rot at the base of the tree as well...

Also, is the black under the chipping bark normal or is my poor tree screwed? 

Sorry for the long explanation, thanks in advance for any advice!"

I've noticed a trend lately for me. My matches are either heavily favored for my team, or heavily enemy favored and theirs rarely a balanced match in between. This was an 11 minute match, 11 minutes where my tank got 2 E, and theirs got 40 E. Their moira gets 32, ours gets 3. That is insane dude. Last act I placed silver, and still had matches similar to this... Correct me if im wrong but skill based isnt a thing? Doesnt seem like it. Matches seem random."
