# Rarity Farming FAQs

**What is Rarity Farming?**

Rarity Farming is a play-to-earn mechanic that offers players the chance to earn rewards by boosting rarity levels of their Aavegotchi NFTs. By equipping Aavegotchis with the rarest Wearable NFTs, petting them twice (not once) daily, and participating in XP-packed events, players are lining them up for some serious $GHST rewards.

Each element plays a crucial role in boosting your Aavegotchi's standing in the realm of Rarity Farming. So, gear up, show some love, and hit those events hard ‚Äì your Aavegotchi and your wallet will thank you for it!

**Show Me the Money!**

This season, 1.5 million GHST (roughly $1.4 million USD at the time of writing) is up for grabs during the eight-week Rarity Farming period.

**How to Participate?**

To participate in Rarity Farming Season 10, you need to own an Aavegotchi, or you can borrow one from a player who is offering a split on $GHST earned during the borrowing period with Gotchi Lending.

# Payout Allocations

There have been no major changes to Rarity, Kinship, or XP systems since the preceding season.

As such, this season, the 1.5M GHST payout categories are as follows:

* Rarity (50%)
* Kinship (20%)
* XP (10%)
* Gotchi Battler (20%)

As always, all participating Aavegotchis, on Polygon or Geist, have the chance to win non-transferable Baadges and trophies designed by¬†**Xibot**, the summoner and lead artist of Aavegotchi. These rare Baadges are deposited directly into your Aavegotchi to forever prove its unique history of success. Check out the aavesome NFT Baadges your Gotchi could win.

# Four Ways to Win

**Rarity**

Rarity is the main rewards pool, with 50% of player rewards allocated to this leaderboard. An Aavegotchi‚Äôs rarity score is determined based on a number of factors, including:

* Randomly generated traits when the Aavegotchi is summoned
* Points earned from equipping Wearables and Wearable sets
* Changes to trait scores earned by leveling up
* Changes to trait scores made possible by the aging mechanic

To climb this leaderboard, either purchase or summon the rarest Aavegotchi you can, then continue to boost their rarity using the right combination of Wearables and Wearable sets.

Special note: Orium Guild recently launched their new Wearable Rentals Market, which allows players to rent out wearables for a fee. These wearables can be equipped to increase your Aavegotchi's BRS.¬†[Try it here](https://orium.network/collection/polygon-mainnet/0x58de9aabcaeec0f69883c94318810ad79cc6a44f/?ref=blog.aavegotchi.com)¬†to get a leg up on the competition!

**Kinship**

Climbing the Kinship ladder is less capital-intensive than Rarity. To increase your Aavegotchi‚Äôs kinship, simply pet it twice a day (once every 12 hours) or feed it kinship potions. Each time you pet your Aavegotchi, their kinship score will increase by one. It‚Äôs also important to note that for each 24-hour period that passes without petting your Aavegotchi, its kinship score will decrease by one. To climb this leaderboard, make sure you interact with your Gotchi Gang every 12 hours!

**XP**

XP (Experience Points) is the final leaderboard, which allows anyone with an internet connection the ability to earn XP on their Aavegotchi‚Äôs behalf. Players can earn XP by voting in the AavegotchiDAO, attending community events, participating in minigame leaderboard competitions, and drinking XP potions.

To climb this leaderboard, stay active in the Aavegotchi community and keep an eye on our social media platforms so you know how and when you can earn XP!

**Gotchi Battler**

Craft your ultimate Aavegotchi squad, fine-tune their formation, and deploy unique special moves and leadership skills to secure victory in thrilling battles to the death!

**All tournaments begin shortly after the main Rarity Farming event concludes. Stay tuned for specific tournament-related details!**

To participate, you simply need to register your team during the registration period at the start of the tournament; then, your team will automatically progress through each round. Powered by Chainlink‚Äôs VRF random number generator, you can view all the battles on the Gotchi Battler website each day.

The prize pool for this tournament is 300K GHST, so significant prizes await those who manage their Aavegotchi squads most aptly!

It's important to exercise caution and do thorough research before investing in any tokens or projects, especially those that are considered small-cap. These types of investments can be highly speculative and volatile, and there is always a risk of losing your investment.

How Aavegotchi Used Aragon to Build a Metaverse Gaming Protocol,aragonproject,112ae8e,2023-02-14 12:04:09,9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/comments/112ae8e/how_aavegotchi_used_aragon_to_build_a_metaverse/,PanickyProvocation,,"Are you a fan of Aavegotchi? Who isn't, am I right? 

Did you know that Aavegotchi originally used Aragon Contracts for their famous bonding curve?

Check out this article Aragon just posted, its pretty interesting :)  


Aavegotchi was originally founded to build an interactive crypto pet, and has now evolved into an open-source, community-owned gaming protocol that game studios and developers can build on top of.

‚ÄúWe want to build crypto experiences together as a DAO,‚Äù said Jesse, cofounder of Aavegotchi. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like coloring in a coloring book. We just put the pages down.‚Äù  


Aavegotchi is one of the most active DAOs in the ecosystem today. From game developers ¬†to Gotchi enthusiasts to guilds building their own experiences within the Gotchiverse, everyone votes on the direction of the game and helps shape it themselves.

To get their start, they used the Aragon fundraising template to fund their treasury and distribute GHST tokens in a way that softens volatility.

**Today, we‚Äôre going to explore how Aavegotchi got started, how they use Aragon to power their DAO, and what their future plans for the gaming protocol are.**

**Intro, skippable if seen previous posts:** The Information Ratio is a way to look at risk adjusted return. It's returns divided by volatility, but with extra steps for comparing with a benchmark. An asset might have a lot more gain and but only a bit more risk, or the other way around. With the portfolio calculator, just copy to your google drive and enter the symbols and percentages.

Common uses:

* Gaining more insight into a coin/token;
* Comparing coins/tokens of a similar risk level;
* More common with portfolios than single asset.

Higher number is better, negative number is worse than benchmark. High IR can still be too risky/not risky enough for your preference.

# Thoughts

Half year data is *probably* more useful for short term investments.

Low risk cryptocurrencies had a narrower range of 30 day returns.

Idk why VERI has a volatility of 10948620551561000000000000000000000000. But the math checks out.

Exchange tokens are often near the top of the low risk group, with CRO barely entering med risk.

&#x200B;

# Methodology

The formula for IR is: (AssetReturn - BenchmarkReturn)/TrackingError

Tracking Error is StandardDeviation (DailyReturn - DailyBenchmarkReturn).

Calculations were batch done with a script I wrote.

Data for coins come from Coin Gecko API.

Coins with missing days were removed.

[More about IR](https://www.styleadvisor.com/resources/statfacts/information-ratio)

**Disclaimers**

Not financial advice.

High IR doesn't necessarily mean they will perform well in the future.

Idk what most of these coins/tokens are.

I'm personally not using this data as sole deciding factor in anything."

Why do Alchemica-GHST liquidity providers not receive any fees from Quickswap?,Aavegotchi,xwhakv,2022-10-05 13:48:24,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aavegotchi/comments/xwhakv/why_do_alchemicaghst_liquidity_providers_not/,Lifipp,,"I recently decided to unstake my Alchemica LP tokens from GLTR staking and instead try to just provide liquidity to Alchemica pairs on Quickswap and receive fees for providing liquidity (you know - the same way as on any other pool on any other DEX). Alchemica pairs are supposed to generate 0.3% fees for every swap made on Quickswap - they have it written on the pool page:

https://preview.redd.it/ez4jkkihx0s91.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=6684e3e75571080bcbc8531fbb39da124a50ff73

[this pool should be generating 0.3&#37; of fees - where do these fees go if they are not being distributed to the liquidity providers?](https://preview.redd.it/1eck9xl5x0s91.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6051f9fb2c3d826a756d9375112d53dd5da53f)

But after leaving my FUD-GHST, FOMO-GHST, ALPHA-GHST and KEK-GHST LP tokens laying around in my wallet for a week, I decided to check on it if they managed to generate any fees.  


Both Zapper and Debank did not show any ""claimable"" rewards for LPing - only that I provide liquidity on Quickswap: 

[Zapper not showing any rewards](https://preview.redd.it/uynh1dyqv0s91.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a666bae4a12ac5759cb81a0ea59a8a32a5bfd45)

[Debank not showing any rewards](https://preview.redd.it/86x9ewpxv0s91.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=0397af312dc4001284efed4908d5a15de5708c37)

When I clicked on manage pools on Quickswap it could not load the volume graph on any of the Alchemica-GHST pair (although there is a transaction history underneath where u can clearly see people have been swapping 

[Quickswap shows 0$ trading volume even though you can clearly see recent transaction history](https://preview.redd.it/8dxyvxl3w0s91.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=6202757cc30f48ddfe67e8e241e130ed07a68a4b)

So my question is - what is going on with the fees that are being generated on Alchemica liquidity pairs? Why do liquidity providers not receive their rewards?

When staking LP tokens to generate GLTR it was clear to me, that the rewards for liquidity providing go to the smart contract that manages GLTR staking (i.e. to the pocket of Aavegotchi devs), but when I decide not to stake for GLTR the LP rewards (in form of GHST or Alchemica) should go to my wallet, shouldn't it?

If anyone has an idea about what is going on I would be very grateful for an explanation, because I wanted to build a long term farming strategy based on Alchemica LPing and would be really disappointed if I found out, that you cannot receive any rewards for providing liquidity for Alchemcia-GHST pairs :("

üí°What is GHSTÔºü

Aavegotchi (GHST) is a series of rare crypto-collectibles living on Ethereum. Aavegotchis predate most contemporary play-to-earn games as they were among the first ERC-721-based NFT games. They introduced innovative concepts now standard to many blockchain games like dynamic rarity, rarity farming, DeFi mechanics like staking, DAO-governed game mechanics, and an open metaverse with interoperable smart contracts. Aavegotchis are named after the famous Tamagotchi digital pets and are, in a tongue-in-cheek description, rumored to be ""the ghosts of liquidated yield farmers determined to return and bring honor to their familia.""
