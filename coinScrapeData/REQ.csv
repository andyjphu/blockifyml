Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here, and I wouldn't be asking if it weren't my absolute last option. I'm a full-time university student, and my bills have been piling up as l've been struggling to find a new job. I'm currently unemployed but actively applying and hoping to secure something soon.
I have rent and several other bills due within the next week, and l've run out of other resources. My credit card is maxed out, and I'm already in overdraft, so I'm truly in a tough spot. I'm requesting $CAD500, and I can pay it back by the 21st of March as I hope to have a job by then
Any help would mean the world to me, and I'd be more than happy to provide proof of my situation if needed. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this."

Hello, fell a little short on rent due to PayPal holding a transaction for over $300. I know I have one loan out at current time of posting, but that will be repaid before this Friday. 

I can possibly pay this request back sooner if PayPal releases my funds, if not I get paid on the 21st.

Just trying to make it until I get my bonus at the end of the month and then I shouldn’t have to borrow again. Hopefully.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help."
Express session not storing cookies on mobile devices,node,1i9pr00,2025-01-25 10:48:13,1,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1i9pr00/express_session_not_storing_cookies_on_mobile/,Adventurous_Try799,,"I have an odd problem where Express session is storing cookies on desktop browsers, but on mobile devices, cookies are not being stored, causing the login process to fail.  
My session config:

    app.use(session({
        secret: process.env.SECRET,
        store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.DB_URI }),
        cookie: {

        },
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: false,
    }));

Also, I had to use `app.enable('trust proxy')` in order for it to work (I'm not sure why, but after adding this, I could log in on desktop).  
CORS config:

    app.use(cors({
        origin: process.env.REQ_ORIGIN,
        credentials: true
    }));

I've checked the logs in my backend and there are no errors. The only useful information I found was that `req.session.userId` is undefined when the request is from a mobile device.

Also, both the front-end and back-end use HTTPS.

Edit:   
I think it has something to do with the reverse proxy"

Why r people so pushy with nesting???,CoSRants,1i9jdhz,2025-01-25 04:26:55,12,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoSRants/comments/1i9jdhz/why_r_people_so_pushy_with_nesting/,newreditig,Player-Based Rant,"this is a long post i have a lot to get off my chest here lol. 

I grided for Prial like a few days after it dropped. my partner is usually the one that hosts our packs so ill play females and throw down a nest so i can keep tabs on whos in game vs menu or what ppl are playing. I also like to sit on nests when going afk for a bit and ill let whoever wants to nest nest (fcfs). 

But any time im nesting as a new or sought after creature some ppl can be so. fucking. demanding or rude about it. 

from nagging the hell out of me when im just trying to play the game and fly around asking me over and over in public chat to go sit on my nest so they can hatch or SPAMMING nest requests when ive already got someone who asked to have the next egg. Even if i tell them to wait and they can have the next one they will just spam tf out of the request button. 

Some of them dont even stop at one egg. they either hatch, and then try to immediately go KOS, get themself killed, and expect to hatch again. Or they want to use you to mutation hunt or something and just request EVERY time you get an egg even tho they are still the baby you JUST hatched them as. 

Yesterday i was playing in oasis with my partner as prial and someone ill just call Red was like ""faygo- faygo be my mommy"" ""faygo be my mommy"" 

1) weird. i hate the fucking rp elements ppl try to force on ppl hatching im NOT your fucking ""mommy"" keep that shit to urself. 

2) i am trying to play the game and my nest is all the way in tundra. 

they would NOT stop TELLING me to nest. im like - uuhh fine w/e ill give this dude one egg and get them off my back abt it. i was gonna go out of tab anyways to draw or watch something or do some other shit online ider. So i stop what im doing and fly my ass all the way to tundra and park it on my nest for the next few min. i come back from what i was doing out of tab and they are SCREAMING at me in chat for not being the most attentive nester in the world and hatching them the millisecond i had an egg ready. 

i hatch them, im not even talking back to them atp, and they log and i never see them again (thank god). but i dont know why ppl think its appropriate to be so fucking demanding of other people. im not a fucking machine for slots dude. get the creature urself if you want to play it so bad. or at least ASK instead of TELLING ME to hatch you. Are kids seriously not even taught to use please and thanks anymore? why are they so god damn entitled about it. 

idk- from here on out im not nesting ANYONE unless theyre at least being polite about it. I dont usually mind nesting ppl so they can get free slots/trials of stuff esp new stuff. but like- dont be rude. And leave the werid ass ""mommy"" shit out of it. 

This is FAR from the only time my or my partner have had people just being rude af to us while were nesting either. From requesting to hatch and then calling one of our skins ugly then turning around and asking if they can hatch as the ""pretty one"" (what the fuck) to COUNTLESS times someone requests to hatch just to turn around and bite you? whats the function??? People hatching and then just- TAKING the carcasses we keep around to provide sat for babies. Who do you think you are? youre about to be the next carcass thats fs. 

And on the subject of entitlement, people that get SO MAD that you wont nest them that they HUNT YOU DOWN and try to kill you or egg steal. Like bro im sorry you crash out over being told No its giving spoiled brat. The only time i decline nest req anyways is when im mute/trait hunting in SMALL SERVERS. I dont mut hunt in larger servers bc i hunt for hours on end with alt acounts and thats just not smart to do in any sever with more than like 10 people. So when this happens 100% of the time its in a server with like 3 people that arent me and my partner and our alt accounts. Absolutely 0 reason to crash out to that degree because i didnt let you have a free aereis. And with that behavior im glad i didnt bc too many ppl use nest req to locate a nest so they can pester the nester and attack them/steal eggs. like take it to a full server or w/e ffs. "

Submittal Logs,ConstructionManagers,1i9cbpj,2025-01-24 20:58:25,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructionManagers/comments/1i9cbpj/submittal_logs/,Grundle_Fromunda,Discussion,"Is the correct approach to generate a submittal log, submit to design team for review/comment, update based on returned review, then distribute to subs for proper submittals submission? How often is this route taken? I feel like submittal review goes on well into construction. 

Anyway, the actual reason for my post is our company utilizes CMiC, there is a catchphrase in our company that PMs utilize for the software “death by a thousand clicks”. Anyway, working with a high end architect who is extremely particular and had been demanding access into the software while still in precon and constantly requesting the submittal log. I had to ensure them generating the log will take time, I was assisting precon in building MEPFP bid packages and bidding them out, leveling, scope reviews with owner/design team, buying out and sending award reqs so I didn’t have the bandwidth to be generating the log. 

Owner rep was hounding me for the full log and I advised again this would take time - and finally, my point. Owner rep informed me that procore (I have not used since being on CM side of construction, only limited access when working for an MEP sub) has the ability to upload spec book PDF and **autopopulate** a damn submittal log! I was floored, I immediately googled and YUP, accurate. 

Now I’m assuming this isn’t perfect and whatever it churns out needs to be refined, albeit even if that’s the case and it’s between 60-80% accurate I’d like to believe this is still 100% more efficient than the current process through CMiC. 

Just kind of ranting here, curious of others experiences/opinions on anything mentioned above - open discussion was in mind while ranting this out. "

Hi all! First post here as I discovered this sub this morning and glad I did! A little bit of background on my financial situation: I was laid off of work February 1st but was lucky enough to be eligible for unemployment, although on the other hand the state has severely messed up my claim and I’ve yet to receive any money. After fighting with them over the last 4 months I’ve finally gotten it all straightened out and am just awaiting BPC to verify the documents I sent and green light my backpay (which is roughly $5,000 at this point) and weekly claims moving forward. I’ve really struggled with my bills whilst waiting on the state and they’ve gotten to the point where my water and electricity are going to be shut-off by the end of the week. So to get to the point, I was hoping to find a kind enough soul to help me over this last hump before I’m financially stable again. 

Also to any potential lenders, I can and will send proof of unemployment documents if requested."

Attempting to move over to CM,ConstructionManagers,1i8hl4j,2025-01-23 18:40:30,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructionManagers/comments/1i8hl4j/attempting_to_move_over_to_cm/,NotMJHeeHeeShimona,Career Advice,"Howdy,

Wee bit of background, Business Major currently working in Industrial Engineering in aerospace. I really want to get into PM one day and about a year away from a PMP. I feel very insecure in my background as I do not have an engineering degree or any sort of technical background, so not sure outside of my company where I could apply. Living in the PNW I see so many CM jobs in my area and have been spending the last few months debating trying to find a PE job or going back to school for a CM bachelors. If I could get a government CM job or something related to Green Energy I would be incredibly happy. 

Looking at open jobs, I found a Construction Project Administrator position open and I meet the qualifications for it as its not a high up position and really only requires a year of PM experience, nothing really construction related. My company would pay for me to go and get a bachelors in CM without a golden handcuff and zero debt. For a masters I could get 25k a year if I wanted to go that route eventually. I see the occasional associate construction management PM posting and regret not going for that when it was open but the req specified a CM or CE bachelors was highly preferred. Not quite certain if this job is equivalent to a PE or just really dead end and admin focused, some of the responsibilities are:

Making Concepts of designs

Monitors and coordinates parties and supports functions to support schedule and project reviews

Assembling work packages by coordinating estimates, drawings, permits, schedules

evaluating facility requests

Acquiring designs and resources for projects etc.

I feel like I have hit a dead end with my job and want to move on, haven't seen the promotion promised to me almost a year ago and generally burnt out. This does look a bit more admin after really typing out a few of the bullet points but also want everyone's take on it. Why CM? Probably wont get outsourced or impacted by AI, lots of openings around me, a specialized skillset and I enjoy working with the blue collar people. I think this would be a decent way to get experience on my resume and get a CM bachelors at the same time."

* The college refuses to allow ***any new accommodation*** beyond a default *""extended testing time""* and *""quiet room"" ,* regardless of the disability
* ^((I don't have this but I read it in the handbook)) They also don't believe schizophrenia counts as a disability
* Claims ""some universities are exempt from having to follow disability laws""
* Goes through a repeating cycle of saying that Dyscalculia *""isn't real/doesn't know what that is""* & *""Doesn't believe I have Dyscalculia""* & then keeps saying *""I'm not here to diagnose you.""*
* They keep claiming graphing calculators ""give you the answer to everything"" so they refuse to accommodate it... even though I already bought the HP Prime Graphing Calculator  ^((they told me after the fact))
* They keep asking the professor if he thinks i'm disabled and if he wants to allow the accommodations
* The professor is ***highly*** ableist and abusive, use of slurs regularly and expressed extreme distrust & prejudice of my diagnosis and the concept of Dyscalculia when I attempted to have a conversation about it with him.
* Disability head screens my calls ^((and i think every call?)) and I can only get him to get on the phone if I call somebody else to go get him to pick up the phone
* Services have repeatedly lied to me by saying they will do actions that they never do, ranging from ""calling me back"" to ""meeting with the professor to handle this"" to ""emailing me"" basically anything they say they're going to do, they just don't do...
* I've had discussions with other disability services from both private and public universities and both say this is unheard of behavior.
* The college refuses to meet with me, instead they insist they meet with the math professor to discuss MY Dyscalculia and whether or not my accommodation request is reasonable.
* They've refused multiple times to meet with me to pen my accommodations letter
* and just today, after emailing the head once again in a grueling goose chase to get the guy to actually answer.... The professor dropped me from the class entirely...

  
What do I do here????

Like I'm starting to believe there's no other option other than to contact some sort of lawyer or... just drop out...?

Even crazier, Intermediate Algebra is a *Pre-requisite.... It doesn't even count as a credit...*  
A class I'm forced to take that's gatekeeping me out of graduation because I took a test in 2019 when i was ***UNDIAGNOSED***



I have no idea what to do, what do I do from here? who do I even contact? Is there anyone I can even contact??? If the college refuses to follow any laws or regulations what do i do?????

  
\[Update\]

  
I also just found out that I've taken two subsequent math pre-req courses that should've counted for graduation under Florida statue but they're refusing to count them towards my graduation requirements... So i should have already met graduation requirements 8 months ago..."
I'm confused,OffMyChestIndia,1i87x6e,2025-01-23 11:54:36,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1i87x6e/im_confused/,forgottenBastard,Confusing Thoughts,"Hey this is my first time posting here so idk about anything related to algorithm and shit,

So i (M20 ) met this girl ( F19 ) back in my 12th when I joined a coaching center during my boards, we never interacted much during the coaching, but few days later she sent me friend request on Instagram even though It's completely anonymous to everyone, I don't even follow my classmates in the coaching but somehow she found it and and sent me the req i left it pending for a few weeks then seeing as I didn't accept she sent me a DM saying why am I not accepting her request, i then in the Awkward situation there had to accept the request 

Then as the days passed she started throwing weird signs, liking my Stories everyday and reacting to my photos ( not mine but the scenery photos i click using my dslr ) during my boards she asked me where my exam center was stationed and i told her about it and then she goes “ I wish we had the same, you would've been so helpful to me ” as her exam center was different from mine, the onwards she started texted me pretty much everyday and stated asking questions like how were my exams going and how do I study and revise etc etc, 

Well most of the times i gave her dry responses and left her on seen as I wasn't interested in her but she has gotten way too clingy in the last one year, reminder I am in my 2nd year of computer science and she is doing ba, she has started asking me about my career planning and even what my pov are on marriage and my types of women, but today she asked me if i had a gf or not, she's throwing mixed signals and it's leaving me confused af..💀

I think she's interested in me but I am a person who overthinks all the time and I have a gut feeling she's trying to manipulate me or something like that, remind you she's an extremely beautiful and kind girl..well that was all i had to say I know this post will feel like a made up story but only I know my situation and what a messy situation I am in rn "
