How do I ship to USA from Rails of Sheffield?,modeltrains,1i9u58w,2025-01-25 13:59:14,6,0.88,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/modeltrains/comments/1i9u58w/how_do_i_ship_to_usa_from_rails_of_sheffield/,DaSnite,Question,"I am an American that loves British models and was about to purchase some Hornby track from Rails of Sheffield, yet every time I try checking out, my card gets declined for usage restrictions. I did a bit of research and found that Rails does not convert USD to GBP and I need to do that manually. Does anybody know how to do this on google pay or another British model retailer with similar prices to Rails that accepts USD?

Edit: I use a debit card. It is a mastercard issued by Fintwist which I believe is associated with Legion Bank. I cannot find anything online for payment restrictions and Fintwist has horrible customer service. If anybody is familiar with the company please let me know!"

This weeks lesson from a swing traders perspective,Forex,1i9pd1z,2025-01-25 10:30:37,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1i9pd1z/this_weeks_lesson_from_a_swing_traders_perspective/,JGWhiteTrade,Fundamental Analysis,"This has been quite the week for trading as we all know. With Trump being the driving force behind the volatility and sentiment / expectations being the driving force behind some of the market moves this week - at least from what I can see. 

I ended up being burned on my GBP/USD short position which I have been holding since January 15th. I had full conviction in my trade and journaled my every thought process and justification (I have previously posted a journal entry if you are interested in how I approach trading) but yet the fact that Trump has eased on his approach (at least publicly) on tariffs especially towards China, the USD has weakened against the GBP. We have consistently seen weaker economic data releases come out from the UK and though the US has shown some weakness in their data - their weakness still holds more strength when compared the UK economy. I still suspect that the BOE will cut more and quicker than the FED due to economic conditions and the fact that the FED has little wiggle-room to pivot - regardless of what Trump says (though he seems to know more than FED as he says‚Ä¶). 

I knew and understood that noise would enter the market and trade once Trump took the Whitehouse and gave the position breathing room to account for it but in the end I ended up losing approximately 3% of the portfolio (though still in profit YTD). 

The lesson for me this week and though is probably known to most here, is the following: 

* Just because I can‚Äôt see strength in one economy / currency, doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt justification for weakness in the other.¬†

There‚Äôs two sides of a trade when entering a forex position and sometimes I find myself focusing too much on the surface level comparison such as the UK economy continuing to show weakness when compared to the US, without focusing on the fact that the market doesn‚Äôt need strength in the GBP for the pound to raise against the dollar, should the dollar have reason to weaken.

Belize replaces British monarch on bank notes with ‚Äònational heroes‚Äô,monarchism,1i9exdx,2025-01-24 23:21:18,76,0.93,33,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/royal-family/article/belize-replaces-british-monarch-on-bank-notes-with-national-heroes-s6fjf900b,BlessedEarth,News,"Belize has removed the British monarch from its bank notes in favour of ‚Äúnational heroes‚Äù who campaigned for the country‚Äôs independence.

The late Queen‚Äôs image will be replaced by that of the late George Price, the country‚Äôs first prime minister who orchestrated Belize‚Äôs independence from Britain in 1981, and the late Philip Goldson, a former newspaper editor, activist and politician who campaigned against colonialism.

Explaining the decision, Dr John Brice√±o, the prime minister of Belize, said: ‚ÄúI know some people will say, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have the Queen‚Äô. Well, the Queen is dead and that has nothing to do with the Belize dollar; it is based on our economy and the amount of US reserves, that is not the pound, that is the US dollar.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúIt is a beautiful note. We have been using our two national heroes, George Price and Philip Goldson, and we have them in different denominations ‚Ä¶ it is something that Belizeans will accept, and it is our people on our note.‚Äù

Unveiling the notes on Thursday, Brice√±o said it was a way to ‚Äúhonour Belize‚Äôs cultural heritage and the transformative impact our national heroes have had on our country‚Äù.

Belize gained independence from Britain in 1981 but remains one of the 14 Commonwealth realms outside the UK that recognises King Charles as its head of state.

In 2023, however, Brice√±o said that Belize was ‚Äúquite likely‚Äù to be the next state to become a republic, removing the King as their head of state.

The Belize currency is pegged to that of the US, with two US dollars worth one Belize dollar.

Kareem Michael, the governer of the Belize Central Bank, said: ‚ÄúBelize will be joining a growing list of Commonwealth countries that once featured Queen Elizabeth II on their money but no longer do today.‚Äù

In 2023, Australia‚Äôs central bank said that it was removing the British monarch from its bank notes, placing an indigenous design on its $5 note rather than an image of King Charles.

Jamaica, another Commonwealth realm, removed the British sovereign from its notes in 1969 but has not yet held a referendum to become a republic.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Timothy Antoine, governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, said there were people in the region who felt that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to move in a different direction and rather than continuing with the British sovereign, that we should be looking at using our own landmarks and our own heroes‚Äù.

The most recent royal visit to Belize was in 2022 when the Prince and Princess of Wales, then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, had to drop one of their engagements in the country in response to a protest.

When they travelled on to Jamaica, the royal couple was told by Andrew Holness, the prime minister, that his country was ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù from the British monarchy.

Canada and New Zealand have announced that they intend to use an image of the King when new bank notes come into circulation."

Main Plot:
In the early 1810s, Jack ""Sunny"" McGuffin, a carefree, sun-loving American sailor, spends his days lazily coasting along the Eastern Seaboard, fishing, napping, and occasionally engaging in questionable trade deals. One fateful afternoon, while enjoying a cold cider on the deck of his modest sloop, The Lazy Lobster, a British frigate looms on the horizon.

The British Navy, desperate for manpower, boards Jack's vessel and informs him that, due to his vaguely Irish accent and the fact that he once ""accidentally"" wore a red coat at a costume party, he's clearly a British subject. Jack protests, declaring his allegiance to ""the good ol' U.S. of A."", but the Brits aren't having it. They haul him aboard their ship, The HMS Stiff Upper Lip, where he's informed that he's now a proud member of His Majesty's Royal Navy.

What follows is a comedy of errors as Jack tries to adjust to life as an unwilling British sailor. He‚Äôs assigned menial tasks like scrubbing the deck with a toothbrush and fetching tea for the ship‚Äôs eccentric captain, Commodore Nigel Crumpetsworth, a man obsessed with perfecting the art of the ""stern but fair"" glare. Jack‚Äôs attempts to escape are thwarted by a hilariously overenthusiastic midshipman, Percival Puddingbottom, who sees Jack as his new best friend and insists on teaching him British manners.

As the ship sails further into British waters, Jack begins to hatch increasingly absurd escape plans, including training the ship's pet parrot to deliver a message for help and pretending to be a French spy in the hopes of getting kicked off the ship. Meanwhile, his charm and good humor win over the crew, who start to question whether impressment is really the best policy.

Subplot:
Back in Boston, Jack‚Äôs loyal dog, Biscuit, is living his best life, running free through the cobblestone streets. Biscuit becomes a local legend, evading dogcatchers and stealing sausages from street vendors with the agility of a canine Robin Hood. However, Biscuit‚Äôs luck runs out when he‚Äôs finally caught by the overly zealous Officer Horatio Sniffle.

Biscuit is taken to the pound, where he rallies the other dogs to stage a daring escape. Using a combination of paw signals, strategic barking, and sheer determination, Biscuit leads a ragtag group of stray dogs in a jailbreak that would make any human heist crew proud. Biscuit‚Äôs ultimate goal? Find a way to reunite with Jack, even if it means swimming across the Atlantic (though he‚Äôd prefer not to).

Climactic Resolution:
Jack‚Äôs luck turns when he stumbles upon a secret British plot to blockade American ports. Realizing he can‚Äôt let this happen, he uses his newfound camaraderie with the British crew to stage a mutiny aboard the HMS Stiff Upper Lip. With the help of Percival (who turns out to be shockingly good at sword fighting), Jack seizes control of the ship and sets sail for Boston to warn his countrymen.

At the same time, Biscuit and his canine crew arrive at the Boston docks, just as Jack sails into the harbor aboard the commandeered British frigate. In a heartwarming and utterly ridiculous reunion, Jack and Biscuit are reunited, with Biscuit leaping into Jack‚Äôs arms in slow motion as patriotic music swells in the background.

Epilogue:
Jack becomes a local hero, Biscuit is celebrated as ""Boston's Bravest Dog,"" and Percival decides to stay in America to open a tea shop. Meanwhile, Commodore Crumpetsworth, impressed (no pun intended) by Jack‚Äôs leadership, retires to write a memoir titled Pressed for Glory: My Life as a British Naval Officer.

As the credits roll, Jack and Biscuit lounge on The Lazy Lobster, enjoying the sun and the freedom they fought so hard to protect."
WORDS WITH WEIGHT,etymology,1i9e0oh,2025-01-24 22:29:38,13,0.76,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/1i9e0oh/words_with_weight/,Correct_Win_9176,Cool etymology,"Have you ever wondered how words like ""append,"" ""depend,"" or even ""suspense"" are connected to the same root? English is full of words that, at first glance, seem unrelated but share deep linguistic roots that tie them together in fascinating ways. One of these roots is *pend*, which means ""to hang"" or ""to weigh.""

This root has made its way into business, like the word *pound* (used as British currency), science, like *pendulum*‚Äîa device we often learn about in physics‚Äîand also various words in our daily life.

**Pending**

In English, ""pending"" retains the sense of something that is ""hanging"" or ""awaiting."" It describes a situation where an outcome or decision is not yet finalized and is¬†**""hanging"" in a state of uncertainty until it is resolved or acted upon**. In this word, we get a sense of waiting and uncertainty about whether it will be done or not. For example, when your job proposal is pending, you are not sure if you will get the job or not.

# Pound

The word ""pound"" comes from the Latin¬†*pondus*, which means ""weight."" This Latin term is derived from the verb¬†*pendere*, meaning ""to weigh"" or ""to hang."" But how is the idea of hanging connected with weight?

In ancient times, weights were often measured using scales that worked on the principle of¬†**hanging weights on one side of the scale to balance against another side**. You would put an object of unknown weight on one side and keep adding known weights on the other side until the scale or bar balanced. When balanced, the total weight of the known objects equaled the unknown weight. This method involved hanging weights to measure and determine the mass of objects. That is how the word ""pound"" for weight became associated with hanging.

Cat suddenly started peeing all over the house,AskVet,1i8tc5p,2025-01-24 06:30:30,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1i8tc5p/cat_suddenly_started_peeing_all_over_the_house/,scoiciii,,"Hello,

I am seeking some opinions in regards to what is currently happening to my cat. Around 3 days ago, my family noticed that whenever my cat sat down, he left behind a droplet of urine. They took him to the vet, which diagnosed him with Cystitis and prescribed him antibiotics. After the first dose of antibiotics, his conditioned seemed to improve slightly. However, a few hours after the 2nd dose, while left unattended, my cat started peeing everywhere, and I mean everywhere in the house.

When he urinates, he still takes the specific stance that cats usually take, sitting down with his tail raised and slightly shaking, which I guess indicates that he is aware of what he's doing and the urine is not just leaking out of his body.

My family is taking him back to the vet today, but I just wanted to receive more opinions. We considered side-effects of the antibiotics or maybe a change in behavior that is meant to indicate discomfort. We also thought about some neurological issue, but with the onset being so sudden it seemed weird. 

Any advice is appreciated and I look forward to hearing your opinions. Meanwhile, you can find some more information below.

**Species: Cat**

* **Age:** 14, almost 15
* **Sex/Neuter status:** M, not neutered (at the advice of the doctor)
* **Breed:** British Shorthair Blue
* **Body weight:** 5.3 Kg (or 11.6 pounds)
* **History:** In summer, he had a near-death experience when his bladder got clogged with kidney stones. He had some sort of device inserted in his urethra that helped him urinate, while also taking shots and medicine to dissolve the stones. He was declared healthy a few weeks later.

While I don't have access to his test results, I remember the doctor saying that all values were within their normal ranges. He even remarked that my cat was incredibly healthy for his age.

He's had other minor urinary tract issues and has been taking medicine, in the form of a gel, for it since  he was around 8 years old. Since summer, they upped his dose a bit, to one pea size portion of gel per day. Here is a [picture of what the gel looks like](https://mobilepet.ro/images/detailed/22/Diafarm-Urolsyn-dog---100g.jpg).

* **Clinical signs:** Cat pees all over the house. He doesn't mark his territory as he leaves behind quite a bit of urine. He still uses his litterbox to pee just as frequently as he did before.
* **Duration:** less than 24h from the moment of posting this
*  **Your general location:** Eastern Europe

The two principal **Rothschild representatives** in New York, J.P. Morgan Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were the firms which set up the Jekyll Island Conference at which the Federal Reserve Act was drafted, who directed the subsequent successful campaign to have the plan enacted into law by Congress, and who purchased the controlling amounts of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914. These firms had their principal officers appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council in 1914.

**Lucky Larry Silverstein, owner of WTC, says he ordered them to ""pull"" building 7, controlled demolition. He and his two kids worked at the WTC every morning. Larry Silverstein ate breakfast every morning on top of WTC. None of them showed up on 9/11. Did Israel messenger service Odigo warn them? Silverstein collected billions on the terrorism insurance on WTC he got months before 9/11. The guy who Bush put in charge of the criminal 9/11 investigation, Michael Chertoff, is a dual Israel-US citizen whose mom was Mossad and worked for Mossad airline El Al. His dad was a Talmud scholar. Chertoff let the Dancing Israelis go, let Lucky Larry Silverstein go, then authored the Patriot Act to crush our freedoms.**

#Corbett Report on Dancing Israelis: https://archive.is/KI8ee

From the Corbett Report:

>Their purpose was to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù? But how could they possibly have known what ‚Äúevent‚Äù they were documenting at that point, before the second plane strike when those few who even knew about the situation had assumed it to be an accident or pilot error?

>And when did they arrive at the parking lot to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù anyway?

>The FBI reports show how the men gave confused and often conflicting accounts of when and how they learned about what was happening and when they arrived at the parking lot. Oded Ellner even said they had arrived their shortly after 8:00 AM, which would have been 45 minutes before the attacks even began. This is in line with one of the eyewitnesses that had placed their Urban Moving Systems van at the parking lot at 8:00 AM [see page 33 here]. How could they have been in place and ready to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù unless they knew what was about to happen?

>Anyway you cut it, this story is unbelievable. Men with documented connections to Israeli intelligence and working in the United States without appropriate permits were detained after having been caught celebrating the attack on the World Trade Center at a time when no one knew that the WTC strike was an attack. So surely these men are locked behind bars to this day, right? Surely they were transferred to Guantanamo and held without trial for 15 years as part of the ‚ÄúWar on Terror,‚Äù weren‚Äôt they?

>No. They were immediately transferred to federal custody, held for 71 days, and then deported back to Israel. The owner of the ‚ÄúUrban Moving Systems‚Äù company that had employed them, Dominik Suter, was investigated by the FBI, too. They¬†concluded¬†that ‚ÄúUrban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation‚Äù and even seized records and computer systems from the company‚Äôs offices. When they went back to question him again on September 14th, he had fled back to Israel.

>And what about the dancing Israeli‚Äôs pictures themselves? The Justice Department¬†destroyed their copies¬†on January 27, 2014.

>And these intelligence agents on an intelligence mission who were there to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù of 9/11 before anyone knew 9/11 was taking place? Don‚Äôt worry, they were just spying on Arab terrorists.

#Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ""hijacker"" terrorist operation

By Wayne Madsen


British intelligence reported in February 2002 that the Israeli Mossad ran the Arab hijacker cells that were later blamed by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission for carrying out the aerial attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. WMR has received details of the British intelligence report which was suppressed by the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. A Mossad unit consisting of six Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jews infiltrated ""Al Qaeda"" cells in Hamburg (the Atta-Mamoun Darkanzali cell), south Florida, and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates in the months before 9/11. The Mossad not only infiltrated cells but began to run them and give them specific orders that would eventually culminate in their being on board four regularly-scheduled flights originating in Boston, Washington Dulles, and Newark, New Jersey on 9/11.

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the ""Al Qaeda"" cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad's Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the ""Al Qaeda"" cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli ""art students,"" already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab ""hijacker"" cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg ""Al Qaeda"" members to Boston. Logan International Airport's security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù International Consultants on Targeted Security √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú ICTS. ICTS's owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks.

The two Mossad teams sent regular coded reports on the progress of the 9/11 operation to Tel Aviv via the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. WMR has learned from a Pentagon source that leading Americans tied to the media effort to pin 9/11 on Arab hijackers, Osama Bin Laden, and the Taliban were present in the Israeli embassy on September 10, 2001, to coordinate their media blitz for the subsequent days and weeks following the attacks. It is more than likely that FBI counter-intelligence agents who conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy have proof on the presence of the Americans present at the embassy on September 10. Some of the Americans are well-known to U.S. cable news television audiences. In mid-August, the Mossad team running the Hamburg cell in Boston reported to Tel Aviv that the final plans for 9/11 were set. The Florida-based Mossad cell reported that the documented ""presence"" of the Arab cell members at Florida flight schools had been established.

The two Mossad ""Al Qaeda"" infiltration and control teams had also helped set up safe houses for the quick exfiltration of Mossad agents from the United States. Last March, WMR reported: ""WMR has learned from two El Al sources who worked for the Israeli airline at New York√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s John F. Kennedy airport that on 9/11, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all civilian domestic and international incoming and outgoing flights to and from the United States, a full El Al Boeing 747 took off from JFK bound for Tel Aviv√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Ben Gurion International Airport. The two El Al employee sources are not Israeli nationals but legal immigrants from Ecuador who were working in the United States for the airline. The flight departed JFK at 4:11 pm and its departure was, according to the El Al sources, authorized by the direct intervention of the U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. military officials were on the scene at JFK and were personally involved with the airport and air traffic control authorities to clear the flight for take-off. According to the 9/11 Commission report, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all civilian flights to be grounded at 9:45 am on September 11."" WMR has learned from British intelligence sources that the six-man Mossad team was listed on the El Al flight manifest as El Al employees.

For Mossad, the successful 9/11 terrorist ""false flag"" operation was a success beyond expectations. The Bush administration, backed by the Blair government, attacked and occupied Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein, and turned up pressure on Israel's other adversaries, including Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Hamas, and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Israelis also saw the U.S., Britain, and the UN begin to crack down on the Lebanese Shi'a diamond business in Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa, and with it, the logistics support provided by Bout's aviation companies, which resulted in a free hand for Tel Aviv to move in on Lebanese diamond deals in central and west Africa.

Then-Israeli Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu commented on the 9/11 attacks on U.S. television shortly after they occurred. Netanyahu said: ""It is very good!"" It now appears that Netanyahu, in his zeal, blew Mossad's cover as the masterminds of 9/11.

#EVERYTHING You Never Knew About Mohammed Atta ‚Äì The CIA Trained Asset | The Daily Drudge Report

Finally, if one looks at the affiliations of the attack leader and financiers, one will see multiple linkages to US covert operations and U.S. intelligence allies.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta, reportedly responsible for coordinating the attacks, trained his men and himself at the Huffman Aviation Flight Training school. That school was funded by Wally Hilliard, with Oryx Corporation. Oryx was founded by Adnan Khashoggi and Sheik Kamal Adham, director of Saudi intelligence (1963-79). Khashoggi was the individual that brokered the meeting between¬† terrorists and the Yeltsin Family. Khashoggi was also extensively involved in the following Bush operations: the October Surprise, Iran-Contra, Azerbaijan, Barrick Gold and the Marcos Gold.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta during his time in the U.S. remained a close friend of Wolfgang Bohringer, an apparent CIA agent.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard, nominal owner of the training facility which acted as cover for the terrorists,¬† is a significant investor in a small California defense/electronics company (Spatialight, Inc.) with Farhad Azima, another member of the Iran-Contra/Azerbaijan group. Azima‚Äôs role had been to coordinate air transportation for covert US intelligence operations for Iran-Contra and Azerbaijan.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard is reported as a close friend of CIA agent Mark Schubin, whose father was a KGB colonel.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard is also strongly linked to the Jeb Bush political machine in Florida, and has had his commercial transport operations endorsed by that group.
‚Ä¢ Mohammad Atta, as can best be determined, received funding from three foreign intelligence agencies aligned with the US: Pakistan, Syria and Germany. His father contended he actually worked for a fourth ‚Äì the Mossad!
‚Ä¢ Director of the ISI (Pakistani) Intelligence director-general Lt-Gen Mahmud Ahmad. The week of September 11, General Ahmad was meeting with Bob Graham, Porter Goss and Richard Armitage. Gen Mahmud Ahmad was responsible for having $100,000 transferred to Mohammed Atta.
‚Ä¢ While in Germany, Atta worked as¬† an employee of Tatex Trading which was owned primarily by Mohamad Majed Said, a former head of Syria‚Äôs General Intelligence Directorate.
‚Ä¢ In coming to Germany, Atta was funded with a scholarship and employed as a tutor by an organization known as Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft. Subsequent Internet reports linked the Carl Duisberg Society to administration by the U.S. Information Agency, but this had not been verified by any government documentation. There are Internet reports that the scholarship was jointly funded by USAID.¬† The more interesting aspect of Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft is that it‚Äôs Managing Director is Bernd Schleich, the same individual who is Managing Director of InWEnt (Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung). If one investigates the activities and research of InWEnt, it appears to be a commercial intelligence operation that does studies on such matters as money-laundering, weapons trades, drug smuggling, and anthrax control in such places as South America, Central Asia and Africa. Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft has a fellowship funded by Alpha Group, the Russian Bank represented in the U.S. by former George H.W. Bush administrators Ed Rogers and Lanny Griffith.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta‚Äôs father claimed his son was working for the Mossad. Supporting this view, Atta was reported as having left phone records of calls to a company named ‚ÄúVirtual Prototypes.‚Äù Virtual Prototypes Inc. would later change its name to eNGENUITY Technologies.¬† It seems as though the type of work done at eNGENUITY was of more interest to the Israeli government, than it might be of use to a group such as Al Qaeda, as the Israelis made significant purchases from eNGENUITY three years later.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta would be discovered to be a legal business partner to Hassan Erroudani, who through the Moroccan American Chamber of Commerce would be associated with the Allied Media Group, a major recruiter for US Defense organizations and private security firms. Their customers would include:
‚Ä¢ USAF
‚Ä¢ US Army
‚Ä¢ FBI
‚Ä¢ US Treasury
‚Ä¢ Department of Justice
‚Ä¢ Department of State
‚Ä¢ CACI
‚Ä¢ Young & Rubicam
‚Ä¢ Burson Marsteller
Atta and his sponsor‚Äôs were not jihadists. As a ‚Äúterrorist pilot‚Äù he spent his last year in the U.S. in the companionship of two CIA pilots (Schubin and¬† Bhoringer). He trained his team at a facility financed by a known financier for CIA operations (Khashoggi). He was a business partner with a CIA recruiter (Erroudani) and he was funded by four pro-CIA intelligence agencies. In essence, Mohamed Atta was a US intelligence community asset working for the United States government.
For at least four years while liv¬≠ing in Ham¬≠burg dur¬≠ing the 1990‚Äôs ter¬≠ror¬≠ist ring¬≠leader Mohamed Atta was part of a ‚Äòjoint ven¬≠ture‚Äô between the U.S. and Ger¬≠man Gov¬≠ern¬≠ments, the Mad¬≠Cow¬≠Morn¬≠ing News has learned, an elite inter¬≠na¬≠tional ‚Äòexchange‚Äô pro¬≠gram run by a little-known pri¬≠vate orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion with close ties to pow¬≠er¬≠ful Amer¬≠i¬≠can polit¬≠i¬≠cal fig¬≠ures like David Rock¬≠e¬≠feller and for¬≠mer Sec¬≠re¬≠tary of State Henry Kissinger. The jointly-funded gov¬≠ern¬≠ment effort picked up the tab for Atta on sojourns in Cairo, Istan¬≠bul, and Aleppo in Syria dur¬≠ing the years 1994 and 1995 and employed him as a ‚Äòtutor‚Äô and ‚Äòsem¬≠i¬≠nar par¬≠tic¬≠i¬≠pant‚Äô dur¬≠ing 1996 and 1997.
Note that Atta‚Äôs Ger¬≠man spon¬≠sor¬≠ship may have dated to 1992 (when the elder George Bush was in office, the Project for a New Amer¬≠i¬≠can Century‚Äôs blue¬≠print for US con¬≠trol of the Mid¬≠dle East was for¬≠mu¬≠lated by Paul Wol¬≠fowitz in 1992, when he was work¬≠ing for the elder Bush. The pos¬≠si¬≠bil¬≠ity that the 1992 spon¬≠sor¬≠ship of Atta by his mys¬≠te¬≠ri¬≠ous Ger¬≠man bene¬≠fac¬≠tors and Wolfowitz‚Äôs 1992 pro¬≠jec¬≠tions are con¬≠nected is not one to be too read¬≠ily dismissed.
More¬≠over Atta‚Äôs finan¬≠cial rela¬≠tion¬≠ship with the U.S.-German gov¬≠ern¬≠ment effort may even have extended back to his ini¬≠tial move from Egypt to Ger¬≠many in 1992, after being ‚Äòrecruited‚Äô in Cairo by a mys¬≠te¬≠ri¬≠ous Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple dubbed the ‚Äòhijacker‚Äôs spon¬≠sors‚Äô in a recent news account in the Chicago Tri¬≠bune. In the years before he became a ‚Äòter¬≠ror¬≠ist ring¬≠leader,‚Äô Atta was enjoy¬≠ing the patron¬≠age of a gov¬≠ern¬≠ment ini¬≠tia¬≠tive over¬≠seen by the U.S. State Depart¬≠ment and the Ger¬≠man Min¬≠istry of Eco¬≠nomic Coop¬≠er¬≠a¬≠tion and Devel¬≠op¬≠ment, the Ger¬≠man equiv¬≠a¬≠lent of the U.S. Agency cur¬≠rently super¬≠vis¬≠ing the secre¬≠tive bid¬≠ding race for tens of bil¬≠lions of dol¬≠lars of post-war recon¬≠struc¬≠tion con¬≠tracts in Iraq, the Agency for Inter¬≠na¬≠tional Development.‚Äù
The orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion that appar¬≠ently spon¬≠sored Atta‚Äôs trav¬≠els was the Carl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft (its Amer¬≠i¬≠can com¬≠po¬≠nent is the Carl Duis¬≠berg Society)‚Äînamed for one of the prin¬≠ci¬≠pal fig¬≠ures in the found¬≠ing of I.G. Farben.
News that Mohamed Atta had been on the pay¬≠roll of an elite inter¬≠na¬≠tional pro¬≠gram known as the ‚ÄòCongress-Bundestag Pro¬≠gram first sur¬≠faced a month after the 9/11 attack in a brief seven-line report by Ger¬≠man news¬≠pa¬≠per Frank¬≠furter Alge¬≠meine Zeitung on 10/18/2001 under the head¬≠line ‚ÄòAtta was Tutor for Schol¬≠ar¬≠ship Hold¬≠ers.‚Äô The story quoted a spokesman for ‚ÄòCarl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft,‚Äô described as a ‚ÄòGer¬≠man inter¬≠na¬≠tional fur¬≠ther edu¬≠ca¬≠tion orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion,‚Äô as hav¬≠ing admit¬≠ted pay¬≠ing Ham¬≠burg cadre prin¬≠ci¬≠pal Atta as a ‚Äòschol¬≠ar¬≠ship holder‚Äô and ‚Äòtutor,‚Äô as the spokesman put it, between 1995 and 1997.‚Äù
But the shock¬≠ing rev¬≠e¬≠la¬≠tion that Atta had there¬≠fore been on the pay¬≠roll of a joint U.S.-German gov¬≠ern¬≠ment pro¬≠gram was con¬≠cealed by the news¬≠pa¬≠per through the sim¬≠ple expe¬≠di¬≠ent of neglect¬≠ing to men¬≠tion that the ‚ÄòCarl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft‚Äô was merely a pri¬≠vate entity set up to admin¬≠is¬≠ter an offi¬≠cial U.S. and Ger¬≠man gov¬≠ern¬≠ment ini¬≠tia¬≠tive. The U.S. end of the pro¬≠gram is run out of an address at United Nations Plaza in New York by CDS Inter¬≠na¬≠tional. The let¬≠ters stand for Carl Duis¬≠berg Soci¬≠ety, which is also the name of its Ger¬≠man coun¬≠ter¬≠part in Cologne, the Carl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft.

>One would normally expect the Dallas strip-club owner Jack Ruby to be the most investigated character by Kennedy truthers. But that is not the case.

>Of course, it is perfectly normal that Chief Justice Earl Warren, when Ruby told him on June 7, 1964, ""I have been used for a purpose,"" failed to ask him who had used him and for what purpose.1¬†But what about independent investigators? Are only readers of the¬†Forward¬†(""News That Matters To American Jews"") worthy of being informed that¬†""Lee Harvey Oswald's Killer 'Jack Ruby' Came From Strong Jewish Background,""¬†and that¬†he told his rabbi Hillel Silverman that he ""did it for the Jewish people""?¬†Here is the relevant passage of Steve North's 2013 article, relating Silverman's reaction after hearing on the radio that a ""Jack Rubenstein"" had killed the assassin:

>""I was shocked,"" said Silverman. ""I visited him the next day in jail, and I said, 'Why, Jack, why?' He said, 'I did it for the American people.'"" I interrupted Silverman, pointing out that other reports had Ruby saying he did it ""to show that Jews had guts."" The rabbi sighed.¬†""Yes, he mentioned that,""¬†Silverman said. ""But I don't like to mention it. I think he said, 'I did it for the Jewish people.' But I've tried to wipe that statement from my mind.""2

>Ruby's defense lawyer William Kunstler also claims in his memoir that Ruby told him: ""I did it for the Jews,""¬†repeating on several occasions: ""I did this that they wouldn't implicate Jews.""¬†During Kunstler's last visit Ruby handed him a note in which he reiterated that his motive was to ""protect American Jews from a pogrom that could occur because of anger over the assassination.""3¬†There is only one possible interpretation of Ruby's words:¬†he must have known, and those who tasked him with killing Oswald must have known, that if Oswald was tried, the Jewish hand in JFK's assassination would likely be made apparent.

üö®JFK ASSASSINATION - ZIONIST CONNECTION

The JFK assassination was the tragic killing of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. The event shook the nation and is remembered as one of the darkest moments in American history.

Many of you know the conspiracies surrounding the assassination, but here we are going to focus on Mossad and Zionist connections.

- JFK & Israeli Nukes -

One of the larger controversies about JFK and his assassination were the events leading up to his death.

 Just prior to his assassination Kennedy would go back and forth with Israel on their nuclear capabilities, with the then prime minister of Israel, stating that without nuclear weapons, Israel would cease to exist.

After continuous requests for neutral scientists to evaluate the reactors on site, Israel would create fake control rooms that were intended to look like an energy reactor controls, rather than a weapons grade plutonium isotope manufacturing plant.

Finally the CIA would approve the request with a stipulation that the reactor itself wasn't to be inspected but rather the false control rooms only.

Kennedy shortly after this event was quoted as saying:

""Those sons of bitches lie to me constantly about their nuclear capability"" - John F. Kennedy

Kennedy's reluctance to provide nuclear arms to Israel may just have cost him his life.

- Zionist Member Involvement -

The Jewish community and sponsor ""The Dallas Citizens Council"", directed by Julius Schepps, who was a member of the ADL's (Anti-Defamation League) ""B'nai B'rith"" community, then invites JFK to Dallas, TX.

Many of you have likely seen the JFK footage already, filmed by ADL ""B'nai B'rith"" member, Abraham Zapruder, famous for the Zapruder film. One point of controversy is the placement of Zapruder, being stationed in the perfect location to get the closest filming shot possible of the assassination, without even a flinch or movement as gun shots rang out.

Zapruder was a textile manufacturer headquartered in the Dallas Textile building which was the building where the first two gun shots were supposedly fired from that missed their mark according to ballistics determined by independent investigations after that fateful day.

The building the shots were fired from was owned by a man named David Weisblat, who also happened to be one of the largest financiers at the time of the ADL, and Douglas Jaffe, who was a very significant donor to Lyndon B Johnson, who would be the man to take over the presidency after JFK was killed.

The Chairman of the Dallas Citizen's Council, Sam Bloom would coordinate the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald to the Dallas county jail. During this transfer Oswald would be shot by a man who goes by the name ""Jack Ruby."" Interestingly enough however, Jack Ruby's real name was Jacob Leon Rubenstein.

Almost immediately after the assassination, the Israeli nuclear reactor would go critical, creating the conditions for the weapons grade plutonium isotope, with Israel obtaining nuclear weapons nearly one year later with the approval of the replacement president Lyndon B. Johnson.

It is thought that the uranium for the enrichment process came from a plant in Pennsylvania where almost 200 pounds of weapons-grade uranium went ""missing.""

- Other Notable Points -

Another odd occurrence during this day would be the ""Umbrella Man"" who most either consider to have been a Mossad or CIA agent. This man, during a warm clear day in Dallas, TX was wearing a full black suit and hat with an umbrella over his head protecting his identity at a distance. When the shots rang out, this man would seemingly remain unaffected.

The Warren Commission, the commission set up to investigate the killing was created by none other than Lyndon B. Johnson himself, and had been given limited information as the CIA was considered complicit in a cover-up by withholding important information during the investigation.

- My Opinion -

I fully believe that the CIA, LBJ, and Mossad, in a combined effort, ordered and executed the assassination of a sitting president. With the notable individuals involved on that day, and all of the money involved, the data would indicate the involvement of Mossad as a main perpetrator that day. From the building the initial shots were likely fired from, the controversial film, and the council who invited him, they all have one key point in common.

If you have any additional information to share, please comment below and as always, don't take my word for any of this, feel free to fact check and research each point involved in this write-up and come to your own conclusion.

The great disaster is worse than Harry has estimated,SaintMeghanMarkle,1i8fi8l,2025-01-23 17:08:06,560,0.99,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1i8fi8l/the_great_disaster_is_worse_than_harry_has/,Human-Economics6894,Lawsuits,"I said here that Harry couldn't negotiate. Not that strictly speaking it could not, it is always possible before the judge summons the parties to hear the sentence, that is the fatal point for a negotiation in civil cases. 

But the fact is that Harry shouldn't negotiate. Because yes, he was able to earn ""a certain amount"" of money. But what is everyone saying? That Harry sold out. But this time it sold big. As there are some headlines on YouTube: NGN paid him to keep quiet.

Harry and Sherbone tried and will continue to try to sell this as a victory. It is not. In fact in several discussions in the British media, except for one person or another, the majority saw what we all saw: NGN apologized but did NOT admit guilt. And what did Harry want? The admission of guilt. He didn't get it. And that is a disaster that surprise! It's not over.

Because yes, the horrible story of the News of the World and the disgusting behavior of the British press for almost two decades ended yesterday. And it ended because we had, as I said yesterday, the worst plaintiffs to persecute the press. To Harry, who we already know sells his family, and to Lord Watson. Jain Moir resurfaced horror stories about Mr. (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14318155/inside-courtroom-Prince-Harry-case-JAN-MOIR.html), Lady C is leaving him for the ground in his latest video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ4wJJNguBM&t=382s)

But gentlemen, what about the case of the Daily Mail of 2026? That continues. And that case is a disaster that Harry is not seeing right now how serious it is.

Let's start with the horror scenario: the case of Harry, Elton, Elizabeth Hurley, etc. against the Daily Mail already accumulates costs of 40 million pounds.

Now let's move on to the link between the Daily Mail case and The Sun case.

Harry and the six other plaintiffs against Associated Newspapers do so over allegations of voicemail interception (commonly known as phone hacking) and other serious privacy violations dating back 30 years.

Well, Harry and the other plaintiffs have named about 70 current and former Associated Newspapers journalists. Among those named are Victoria Newton, editor of the Sun, who was entertainment editor of the Daily Mail in the early 2000s, and Tony Gallagher, who was editor of the Daily Telegraph, deputy assistant editor of the Daily Mail and editor of the Sun before to be appointed editor of the Times in 2022. Sunday Times editor Ben Taylor and Mail on Sunday editor David Dillon are also named in the documents.

Well, are you following me? Yesterday someone commented that when he reads me I look like Lady C... ouch!! 

Ok, do you watch The Sun? Yes, Newton was also named in the case that Harry settled yesterday.

Let's be clear: The Sun does NOT accept having deleted emails, The Sun does NOT accept having continued the practice (as Harry pointed out in his lawsuit), nor anything that Sherbone is saying. The Sun did NOT commit perjury, nor does it admit having committed it. 

Yesterday, Harry formally accepted the apology, BUT he also accepted that those who carried out the illegal activities were private investigators working for The Sun. In simple words: Harry accepted that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the journalists and executives working for the newspaper. They just made mistakes. That is the expression ""*the misuse of private information by journalists*""

If Harry sues the same journalists in one case, reaches an agreement in which he accepts that those journalists did not commit illegalities, but then sues them again in another case, do you understand what that means? 

In simple words: Harry has no evidence against the journalists and editors in the Daily Mail case. He doesn't have it, Sherbone doesn't have it because several journalists and editors named in the case against the Daily Mail also worked for The Sun, and yesterday Harry, Watson and Sherbone decided to accept the agreement, releasing journalists and editors from liability and blame, starting with Victoria Newton, and yes, also Rebekah Brooks and others, including Piers Morgan.

Yesterday it emerged that Sherborne was asking the Metropolitan Police to investigate illegal activity admitted by NGN regarding Prince Harry and Lord Watson. In a statement, the force said it currently has no ‚Äúactive‚Äù investigations into phone hacking. Attention: no telephone hacking from any media. 

""*It remains true that there are no active police investigations into allegations of wiretapping or related matters.*"" 

What is the case with the Daily Mail?  Phone hacking. Harry and others are not just accusing about things from 30 years ago, but it is an activity that the Mail continues to do now. On Tuesday, Sherbone was desperately seeking a settlement, because police already made clear that there were no ongoing investigations into any such activity. Harry and Sherbone have to stir the pot of the past again... except that the Mail was NOT linked to the News case (not that the Daily Mail is a saint innocent), but Sherbone is done with his ""lifting the reserve"" story of the Levinson case.

Although Sherbone yesterday boasted that ‚Äú*Prince Harry and Tom Watson join others in calling on the police and parliament to investigate not only the illegal activity finally admitted, but also the perjury and cover-ups that have occurred in the process*,‚Äù and that ‚Äú*Today lies have been exposed, cover-ups have been exposed and it has been shown that no one is above the law. The time has come for accountability*,‚Äù that is no longer going to happen. Harry accepted the non-admission of guilt. Harry accepted the apology agreement and nothing more. And Harry (and Watson) accepted that they can no longer go after the journalists and editors they named in their lawsuit. If Harry persists in suing, that would violate the agreement, and he would not only have to return what he paid but accept a penalty for it.

Sherbone was boasting yesterday, but the News statement is very clear: Harry's war against the media is over, and it ended with Harry lying in the mud to look for his check.  [https://www.news.co.uk/latest-news/statement-from-ngn-publisher-of-the-sun-and-former-publisher-of-the-news-of-the-world-has-today-issued-the-following-statement-to-media/](https://www.news.co.uk/latest-news/statement-from-ngn-publisher-of-the-sun-and-former-publisher-of-the-news-of-the-world-has-today-issued-the-following-statement-to-media/)

And this puts the Daily Mail case in an unbeatable situation. Harry accepted a settlement in which he accepted that the journalists and editors named in his lawsuit were NOT guilty. That is, by 2026, those names should be deleted from Harry's lawsuit. The police do not have any investigation into wiretapping. That puts Harry and the other plaintiffs in the dilemma of how to prove their case. And besides, it's already clear that Harry is the worst lawsuit colleague in any case. Sherbone on Tuesday had a stomach ache all morning because Harry did NOT wake up at his home in California to follow the hearing.

Harry didn't realize yesterday what he was agreeing to. He believes that he can continue with his ""fight."" But no, he just ruined his case against the Mail. And dragged the other plaintiffs down with him.

The little respect that Harry still had in the media died yesterday. And at the worst moment for Harry, because he needed the press to be favorable to him and his wife. But the press yesterday discovered how little Harry's threats really are worth. And Harry didn't have that scenario in mind."
How much exactly is Bubbles Charging?,gutsandblackpowders,1i89hio,2025-01-23 12:58:55,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gutsandblackpowders/comments/1i89hio/how_much_exactly_is_bubbles_charging/,LeontiyLeontyevich,Discussion,"I just wanted to discuss this because the thought popped into my head again.

  
If we were to use the Silver/Gold Standard in the contemporary currency -

French 5 Franc Coin - 25 Grams

American 1 Dollar Coin - 26.96 Grams (Source: Numista)

1 Franc is therefore equal to 5 grams. 26.96/5 is \~5.4

5.4 Francs = 1 Dollar

The water bucket (iirc) is the cheapest item in the shop, at 50 francs or \~9.3 Dollars

According to *History of North America; comprising a geographical and statistical view of the United States, and of the British Canadian possessions; including a great variety of important information on the subject of emigrating to that country. Embellished with plates and maps*, the cost of an acre of Massachusetts land in 1814 was 13.75 Dollars

According to *American state papers : Documents, legislative and executive, of the Congress of the United States*, the monthly pay of a Clerk in the Navy in 1815 was 50 Dollars

According to *Comparative wages, prices, and cost of living : (from the Sixteenth annual report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, for 1885)*, in Massachusetts, the cost of a pound of chicken in 1815 would have been 10 cents, a dozen of Lemons in 1815 would have been 50 Cents, a pound of Flour would have been 58 Cents, the daily wage of a Cooper in 1815 would have been 1.13 Cents, etc. etc. Additionally, if one were to look at the document, most of the wages of laborers, carpenters, goldsmiths, and most other jobs range from less than 1-somewhere around 2 dollars.

So, by selling a ***bucket of water***, if he were to be in Massachusetts, he could afford \~2/3rds of an Acre of Land, 93 Pounds of Chicken, 223 Lemons, 16 Pounds of Flour, and a general week's worth of wages.

In other words, Bubbles is Crassus.

#Rothschild Israel did 9/11 with Rothschild CIA/Mossad

**Lucky Larry Silverstein, owner of WTC, says he ordered them to ""pull"" building 7, controlled demolition. He and his two kids worked at the WTC every morning. Larry Silverstein ate breakfast every morning on top of WTC. None of them showed up on 9/11. Did Israel messenger service Odigo warn them? Silverstein collected billions on the terrorism insurance on WTC he got months before 9/11. The guy who Bush put in charge of the criminal 9/11 investigation, Michael Chertoff, is a dual Israel-US citizen whose mom was Mossad and worked for Mossad airline El Al. His dad was a Talmud scholar. Chertoff let the Dancing Israelis go, let Lucky Larry Silverstein go, then authored the Patriot Act to crush our freedoms.**

#Corbett Report on Dancing Israelis: https://archive.is/KI8ee

From the Corbett Report:

>Their purpose was to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù? But how could they possibly have known what ‚Äúevent‚Äù they were documenting at that point, before the second plane strike when those few who even knew about the situation had assumed it to be an accident or pilot error?

>And when did they arrive at the parking lot to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù anyway?

>The FBI reports show how the men gave confused and often conflicting accounts of when and how they learned about what was happening and when they arrived at the parking lot. Oded Ellner even said they had arrived their shortly after 8:00 AM, which would have been 45 minutes before the attacks even began. This is in line with one of the eyewitnesses that had placed their Urban Moving Systems van at the parking lot at 8:00 AM [see page 33 here]. How could they have been in place and ready to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù unless they knew what was about to happen?

>Anyway you cut it, this story is unbelievable. Men with documented connections to Israeli intelligence and working in the United States without appropriate permits were detained after having been caught celebrating the attack on the World Trade Center at a time when no one knew that the WTC strike was an attack. So surely these men are locked behind bars to this day, right? Surely they were transferred to Guantanamo and held without trial for 15 years as part of the ‚ÄúWar on Terror,‚Äù weren‚Äôt they?

>No. They were immediately transferred to federal custody, held for 71 days, and then deported back to Israel. The owner of the ‚ÄúUrban Moving Systems‚Äù company that had employed them, Dominik Suter, was investigated by the FBI, too. They¬†concluded¬†that ‚ÄúUrban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation‚Äù and even seized records and computer systems from the company‚Äôs offices. When they went back to question him again on September 14th, he had fled back to Israel.

>And what about the dancing Israeli‚Äôs pictures themselves? The Justice Department¬†destroyed their copies¬†on January 27, 2014.

>And these intelligence agents on an intelligence mission who were there to ‚Äúdocument the event‚Äù of 9/11 before anyone knew 9/11 was taking place? Don‚Äôt worry, they were just spying on Arab terrorists.

When Ahmed was exposed by the Wall Street Journal as having sent the money to the hijackers, he was forced to ""retire"" by President Pervez Musharraf.

#Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ""hijacker"" terrorist operation

By Wayne Madsen


British intelligence reported in February 2002 that the Israeli Mossad ran the Arab hijacker cells that were later blamed by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission for carrying out the aerial attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. WMR has received details of the British intelligence report which was suppressed by the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. A Mossad unit consisting of six Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jews infiltrated ""Al Qaeda"" cells in Hamburg (the Atta-Mamoun Darkanzali cell), south Florida, and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates in the months before 9/11. The Mossad not only infiltrated cells but began to run them and give them specific orders that would eventually culminate in their being on board four regularly-scheduled flights originating in Boston, Washington Dulles, and Newark, New Jersey on 9/11.

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the ""Al Qaeda"" cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad's Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the ""Al Qaeda"" cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli ""art students,"" already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab ""hijacker"" cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg ""Al Qaeda"" members to Boston. Logan International Airport's security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù International Consultants on Targeted Security √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú ICTS. ICTS's owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks.

The two Mossad teams sent regular coded reports on the progress of the 9/11 operation to Tel Aviv via the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. WMR has learned from a Pentagon source that leading Americans tied to the media effort to pin 9/11 on Arab hijackers, Osama Bin Laden, and the Taliban were present in the Israeli embassy on September 10, 2001, to coordinate their media blitz for the subsequent days and weeks following the attacks. It is more than likely that FBI counter-intelligence agents who conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy have proof on the presence of the Americans present at the embassy on September 10. Some of the Americans are well-known to U.S. cable news television audiences. In mid-August, the Mossad team running the Hamburg cell in Boston reported to Tel Aviv that the final plans for 9/11 were set. The Florida-based Mossad cell reported that the documented ""presence"" of the Arab cell members at Florida flight schools had been established.

The two Mossad ""Al Qaeda"" infiltration and control teams had also helped set up safe houses for the quick exfiltration of Mossad agents from the United States. Last March, WMR reported: ""WMR has learned from two El Al sources who worked for the Israeli airline at New York√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s John F. Kennedy airport that on 9/11, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all civilian domestic and international incoming and outgoing flights to and from the United States, a full El Al Boeing 747 took off from JFK bound for Tel Aviv√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Ben Gurion International Airport. The two El Al employee sources are not Israeli nationals but legal immigrants from Ecuador who were working in the United States for the airline. The flight departed JFK at 4:11 pm and its departure was, according to the El Al sources, authorized by the direct intervention of the U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. military officials were on the scene at JFK and were personally involved with the airport and air traffic control authorities to clear the flight for take-off. According to the 9/11 Commission report, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all civilian flights to be grounded at 9:45 am on September 11."" WMR has learned from British intelligence sources that the six-man Mossad team was listed on the El Al flight manifest as El Al employees.

For Mossad, the successful 9/11 terrorist ""false flag"" operation was a success beyond expectations. The Bush administration, backed by the Blair government, attacked and occupied Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein, and turned up pressure on Israel's other adversaries, including Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Hamas, and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Israelis also saw the U.S., Britain, and the UN begin to crack down on the Lebanese Shi'a diamond business in Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa, and with it, the logistics support provided by Bout's aviation companies, which resulted in a free hand for Tel Aviv to move in on Lebanese diamond deals in central and west Africa.

Then-Israeli Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu commented on the 9/11 attacks on U.S. television shortly after they occurred. Netanyahu said: ""It is very good!"" It now appears that Netanyahu, in his zeal, blew Mossad's cover as the masterminds of 9/11.

#EVERYTHING You Never Knew About Mohammed Atta ‚Äì The CIA Trained Asset | The Daily Drudge Report

Finally, if one looks at the affiliations of the attack leader and financiers, one will see multiple linkages to US covert operations and U.S. intelligence allies.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta, reportedly responsible for coordinating the attacks, trained his men and himself at the Huffman Aviation Flight Training school. That school was funded by Wally Hilliard, with Oryx Corporation. Oryx was founded by Adnan Khashoggi and Sheik Kamal Adham, director of Saudi intelligence (1963-79). Khashoggi was the individual that brokered the meeting between¬† terrorists and the Yeltsin Family. Khashoggi was also extensively involved in the following Bush operations: the October Surprise, Iran-Contra, Azerbaijan, Barrick Gold and the Marcos Gold.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta during his time in the U.S. remained a close friend of Wolfgang Bohringer, an apparent CIA agent.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard, nominal owner of the training facility which acted as cover for the terrorists,¬† is a significant investor in a small California defense/electronics company (Spatialight, Inc.) with Farhad Azima, another member of the Iran-Contra/Azerbaijan group. Azima‚Äôs role had been to coordinate air transportation for covert US intelligence operations for Iran-Contra and Azerbaijan.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard is reported as a close friend of CIA agent Mark Schubin, whose father was a KGB colonel.
‚Ä¢ Hilliard is also strongly linked to the Jeb Bush political machine in Florida, and has had his commercial transport operations endorsed by that group.
‚Ä¢ Mohammad Atta, as can best be determined, received funding from three foreign intelligence agencies aligned with the US: Pakistan, Syria and Germany. His father contended he actually worked for a fourth ‚Äì the Mossad!
‚Ä¢ Director of the ISI (Pakistani) Intelligence director-general Lt-Gen Mahmud Ahmad. The week of September 11, General Ahmad was meeting with Bob Graham, Porter Goss and Richard Armitage. Gen Mahmud Ahmad was responsible for having $100,000 transferred to Mohammed Atta.
‚Ä¢ While in Germany, Atta worked as¬† an employee of Tatex Trading which was owned primarily by Mohamad Majed Said, a former head of Syria‚Äôs General Intelligence Directorate.
‚Ä¢ In coming to Germany, Atta was funded with a scholarship and employed as a tutor by an organization known as Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft. Subsequent Internet reports linked the Carl Duisberg Society to administration by the U.S. Information Agency, but this had not been verified by any government documentation. There are Internet reports that the scholarship was jointly funded by USAID.¬† The more interesting aspect of Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft is that it‚Äôs Managing Director is Bernd Schleich, the same individual who is Managing Director of InWEnt (Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung). If one investigates the activities and research of InWEnt, it appears to be a commercial intelligence operation that does studies on such matters as money-laundering, weapons trades, drug smuggling, and anthrax control in such places as South America, Central Asia and Africa. Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft has a fellowship funded by Alpha Group, the Russian Bank represented in the U.S. by former George H.W. Bush administrators Ed Rogers and Lanny Griffith.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta‚Äôs father claimed his son was working for the Mossad. Supporting this view, Atta was reported as having left phone records of calls to a company named ‚ÄúVirtual Prototypes.‚Äù Virtual Prototypes Inc. would later change its name to eNGENUITY Technologies.¬† It seems as though the type of work done at eNGENUITY was of more interest to the Israeli government, than it might be of use to a group such as Al Qaeda, as the Israelis made significant purchases from eNGENUITY three years later.
‚Ä¢ Mohammed Atta would be discovered to be a legal business partner to Hassan Erroudani, who through the Moroccan American Chamber of Commerce would be associated with the Allied Media Group, a major recruiter for US Defense organizations and private security firms. Their customers would include:
‚Ä¢ USAF
‚Ä¢ US Army
‚Ä¢ FBI
‚Ä¢ US Treasury
‚Ä¢ Department of Justice
‚Ä¢ Department of State
‚Ä¢ CACI
‚Ä¢ Young & Rubicam
‚Ä¢ Burson Marsteller
Atta and his sponsor‚Äôs were not jihadists. As a ‚Äúterrorist pilot‚Äù he spent his last year in the U.S. in the companionship of two CIA pilots (Schubin and¬† Bhoringer). He trained his team at a facility financed by a known financier for CIA operations (Khashoggi). He was a business partner with a CIA recruiter (Erroudani) and he was funded by four pro-CIA intelligence agencies. In essence, Mohamed Atta was a US intelligence community asset working for the United States government.
For at least four years while liv¬≠ing in Ham¬≠burg dur¬≠ing the 1990‚Äôs ter¬≠ror¬≠ist ring¬≠leader Mohamed Atta was part of a ‚Äòjoint ven¬≠ture‚Äô between the U.S. and Ger¬≠man Gov¬≠ern¬≠ments, the Mad¬≠Cow¬≠Morn¬≠ing News has learned, an elite inter¬≠na¬≠tional ‚Äòexchange‚Äô pro¬≠gram run by a little-known pri¬≠vate orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion with close ties to pow¬≠er¬≠ful Amer¬≠i¬≠can polit¬≠i¬≠cal fig¬≠ures like David Rock¬≠e¬≠feller and for¬≠mer Sec¬≠re¬≠tary of State Henry Kissinger. The jointly-funded gov¬≠ern¬≠ment effort picked up the tab for Atta on sojourns in Cairo, Istan¬≠bul, and Aleppo in Syria dur¬≠ing the years 1994 and 1995 and employed him as a ‚Äòtutor‚Äô and ‚Äòsem¬≠i¬≠nar par¬≠tic¬≠i¬≠pant‚Äô dur¬≠ing 1996 and 1997.
Note that Atta‚Äôs Ger¬≠man spon¬≠sor¬≠ship may have dated to 1992 (when the elder George Bush was in office, the Project for a New Amer¬≠i¬≠can Century‚Äôs blue¬≠print for US con¬≠trol of the Mid¬≠dle East was for¬≠mu¬≠lated by Paul Wol¬≠fowitz in 1992, when he was work¬≠ing for the elder Bush. The pos¬≠si¬≠bil¬≠ity that the 1992 spon¬≠sor¬≠ship of Atta by his mys¬≠te¬≠ri¬≠ous Ger¬≠man bene¬≠fac¬≠tors and Wolfowitz‚Äôs 1992 pro¬≠jec¬≠tions are con¬≠nected is not one to be too read¬≠ily dismissed.
More¬≠over Atta‚Äôs finan¬≠cial rela¬≠tion¬≠ship with the U.S.-German gov¬≠ern¬≠ment effort may even have extended back to his ini¬≠tial move from Egypt to Ger¬≠many in 1992, after being ‚Äòrecruited‚Äô in Cairo by a mys¬≠te¬≠ri¬≠ous Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple dubbed the ‚Äòhijacker‚Äôs spon¬≠sors‚Äô in a recent news account in the Chicago Tri¬≠bune. In the years before he became a ‚Äòter¬≠ror¬≠ist ring¬≠leader,‚Äô Atta was enjoy¬≠ing the patron¬≠age of a gov¬≠ern¬≠ment ini¬≠tia¬≠tive over¬≠seen by the U.S. State Depart¬≠ment and the Ger¬≠man Min¬≠istry of Eco¬≠nomic Coop¬≠er¬≠a¬≠tion and Devel¬≠op¬≠ment, the Ger¬≠man equiv¬≠a¬≠lent of the U.S. Agency cur¬≠rently super¬≠vis¬≠ing the secre¬≠tive bid¬≠ding race for tens of bil¬≠lions of dol¬≠lars of post-war recon¬≠struc¬≠tion con¬≠tracts in Iraq, the Agency for Inter¬≠na¬≠tional Development.‚Äù
The orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion that appar¬≠ently spon¬≠sored Atta‚Äôs trav¬≠els was the Carl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft (its Amer¬≠i¬≠can com¬≠po¬≠nent is the Carl Duis¬≠berg Society)‚Äînamed for one of the prin¬≠ci¬≠pal fig¬≠ures in the found¬≠ing of I.G. Farben.
News that Mohamed Atta had been on the pay¬≠roll of an elite inter¬≠na¬≠tional pro¬≠gram known as the ‚ÄòCongress-Bundestag Pro¬≠gram first sur¬≠faced a month after the 9/11 attack in a brief seven-line report by Ger¬≠man news¬≠pa¬≠per Frank¬≠furter Alge¬≠meine Zeitung on 10/18/2001 under the head¬≠line ‚ÄòAtta was Tutor for Schol¬≠ar¬≠ship Hold¬≠ers.‚Äô The story quoted a spokesman for ‚ÄòCarl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft,‚Äô described as a ‚ÄòGer¬≠man inter¬≠na¬≠tional fur¬≠ther edu¬≠ca¬≠tion orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion,‚Äô as hav¬≠ing admit¬≠ted pay¬≠ing Ham¬≠burg cadre prin¬≠ci¬≠pal Atta as a ‚Äòschol¬≠ar¬≠ship holder‚Äô and ‚Äòtutor,‚Äô as the spokesman put it, between 1995 and 1997.‚Äù
But the shock¬≠ing rev¬≠e¬≠la¬≠tion that Atta had there¬≠fore been on the pay¬≠roll of a joint U.S.-German gov¬≠ern¬≠ment pro¬≠gram was con¬≠cealed by the news¬≠pa¬≠per through the sim¬≠ple expe¬≠di¬≠ent of neglect¬≠ing to men¬≠tion that the ‚ÄòCarl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft‚Äô was merely a pri¬≠vate entity set up to admin¬≠is¬≠ter an offi¬≠cial U.S. and Ger¬≠man gov¬≠ern¬≠ment ini¬≠tia¬≠tive. The U.S. end of the pro¬≠gram is run out of an address at United Nations Plaza in New York by CDS Inter¬≠na¬≠tional. The let¬≠ters stand for Carl Duis¬≠berg Soci¬≠ety, which is also the name of its Ger¬≠man coun¬≠ter¬≠part in Cologne, the Carl Duis¬≠berg Gesellschaft. Both are named for Carl Duis¬≠berg, a Ger¬≠man chemist and indus¬≠tri¬≠al¬≠ist who headed the Bayer Cor¬≠po¬≠ra¬≠tion dur¬≠ing the 1920‚Äôs.
CDS Inter¬≠na¬≠tional, states the organization‚Äôs lit¬≠er¬≠a¬≠ture, pro¬≠vides oppor¬≠tu¬≠ni¬≠ties for young Ger¬≠man pro¬≠fes¬≠sion¬≠als. ‚ÄòThese young Ger¬≠man engi¬≠neers earn real world expe¬≠ri¬≠ence and are given assign¬≠ments to con¬≠tribute from the start,‚Äô a pro¬≠gram spokesman enthused in a news¬≠pa¬≠per interview . . .‚Äù
Hav¬≠ing pow¬≠er¬≠ful friends in such high places may also explain the curi¬≠ous omis¬≠sions in a sec¬≠ond story about Mohamed Atta‚Äôs time in Ger¬≠many which appeared in The Chicago Tri¬≠bune, head¬≠lined ‚Äò9/11 Haunts Hijacker‚Äôs Spon¬≠sors; Ger¬≠man Cou¬≠ple Talks , of Liv¬≠ing with Pilot Atta.‚Äô The March 7, 2003 article describes the 1992 meet¬≠ing in Cairo which led Mohamed Atta to move to Ham¬≠burg, between Atta and a Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple, which the paper does not name, who ran an inter¬≠na¬≠tional stu¬≠dent exchange pro¬≠gram, which the paper also leaves anonymous.
Dur¬≠ing a visit to the Egypt¬≠ian cap¬≠i¬≠tal in fall 1991, said the Tri¬≠bune, the Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple had stayed with friends who knew Atta‚Äôs father, a Cairo lawyer, and his father‚Äôs friends had then intro¬≠duced the Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple to Atta. ‚ÄòAtta who had recently grad¬≠u¬≠ated with a degree in archi¬≠tec¬≠tural engi¬≠neer¬≠ing from the Uni¬≠ver¬≠sity of Cairo, told the cou¬≠ple he wanted to study archi¬≠tec¬≠ture in Ger¬≠many, but he had no par¬≠tic¬≠u¬≠lar idea where he should go,‚Äô the paper reported . . .‚Äù
In this first con¬≠ver¬≠sa¬≠tion, we sug¬≠gested he con¬≠tinue his stud¬≠ies in Ham¬≠burg and offered him a place to live at our house,‚Äô the paper quotes the Ger¬≠man wife telling inves¬≠ti¬≠ga¬≠tors from the BKA, the Ger¬≠man equiv¬≠a¬≠lent of the FBI. Atta, she states, accepted their offer right away. Why did an (unnamed) Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple, run¬≠ning an (unnamed) inter¬≠na¬≠tional exchange pro¬≠gram leap at the chance to engage a young man who was not even con¬≠sid¬≠ered promis¬≠ing enough to gain entrance to a local Cairo grad¬≠u¬≠ate school? The Tri¬≠bune doesn‚Äôt say.‚Äù
After study¬≠ing Ger¬≠man in Cairo, Atta arrived in the coun¬≠try on July 24, 1992, accord¬≠ing to inves¬≠ti¬≠ga¬≠tors‚Äô records, and then lived rent-free for at least the next six months in the couple‚Äôs home in a quiet, middle-class neigh¬≠bor¬≠hood. It is more than curi¬≠ous that although Tri¬≠bune cor¬≠re¬≠spon¬≠dent Steven¬≠son Swan¬≠son cites the Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple for ‚Äòhav¬≠ing played such an impor¬≠tant role in Atta‚Äôs move to Ger¬≠many,‚Äô he never gives their names, nor that of the orga¬≠ni¬≠za¬≠tion they worked for. But since just two years later, Atta was on the pay¬≠roll of the ‚ÄòCongress-Bundestag Pro¬≠gram,‚Äô it is rea¬≠son¬≠able to con¬≠clude that this same government-funded pro¬≠gram was respon¬≠si¬≠ble for bring¬≠ing him to Ger¬≠many in the first place, under the aegis of an unnamed Ger¬≠man cou¬≠ple. His elite spon¬≠sors are appar¬≠ently pow¬≠er¬≠ful enough to keep the organization‚Äôs name out of the news¬≠pa¬≠pers, or at any rate, out of the Chicago Tribune.‚Äù

I interrupted Silverman, pointing out that other reports had Ruby saying he did it ""to show that Jews had guts."" The rabbi sighed.¬†""Yes, he mentioned that,""¬†Silverman said. ""But I don't like to mention it. I think he said, 'I did it for the Jewish people.' But I've tried to wipe that statement from my mind.""2

>Ruby's defense lawyer William Kunstler also claims in his memoir that Ruby told him: ""I did it for the Jews,""¬†repeating on several occasions: ""I did this that they wouldn't implicate Jews.""¬†During Kunstler's last visit Ruby handed him a note in which he reiterated that his motive was to ""protect American Jews from a pogrom that could occur because of anger over the assassination.""3¬†There is only one possible interpretation of Ruby's words:¬†he must have known, and those who tasked him with killing Oswald must have known, that if Oswald was tried, the Jewish hand in JFK's assassination would likely be made apparent.

üö®JFK ASSASSINATION - ZIONIST CONNECTION

The JFK assassination was the tragic killing of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. The event shook the nation and is remembered as one of the darkest moments in American history.

Many of you know the conspiracies surrounding the assassination, but here we are going to focus on Mossad and Zionist connections.

- JFK & Israeli Nukes -

One of the larger controversies about JFK and his assassination were the events leading up to his death.

 Just prior to his assassination Kennedy would go back and forth with Israel on their nuclear capabilities, with the then prime minister of Israel, stating that without nuclear weapons, Israel would cease to exist.

After continuous requests for neutral scientists to evaluate the reactors on site, Israel would create fake control rooms that were intended to look like an energy reactor controls, rather than a weapons grade plutonium isotope manufacturing plant.

Finally the CIA would approve the request with a stipulation that the reactor itself wasn't to be inspected but rather the false control rooms only.

Kennedy shortly after this event was quoted as saying:

""Those sons of bitches lie to me constantly about their nuclear capability"" - John F. Kennedy

Kennedy's reluctance to provide nuclear arms to Israel may just have cost him his life.

- Zionist Member Involvement -

The Jewish community and sponsor ""The Dallas Citizens Council"", directed by Julius Schepps, who was a member of the ADL's (Anti-Defamation League) ""B'nai B'rith"" community, then invites JFK to Dallas, TX.

Many of you have likely seen the JFK footage already, filmed by ADL ""B'nai B'rith"" member, Abraham Zapruder, famous for the Zapruder film. One point of controversy is the placement of Zapruder, being stationed in the perfect location to get the closest filming shot possible of the assassination, without even a flinch or movement as gun shots rang out.

Zapruder was a textile manufacturer headquartered in the Dallas Textile building which was the building where the first two gun shots were supposedly fired from that missed their mark according to ballistics determined by independent investigations after that fateful day.

The building the shots were fired from was owned by a man named David Weisblat, who also happened to be one of the largest financiers at the time of the ADL, and Douglas Jaffe, who was a very significant donor to Lyndon B Johnson, who would be the man to take over the presidency after JFK was killed.

The Chairman of the Dallas Citizen's Council, Sam Bloom would coordinate the transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald to the Dallas county jail. During this transfer Oswald would be shot by a man who goes by the name ""Jack Ruby."" Interestingly enough however, Jack Ruby's real name was Jacob Leon Rubinstein.

Almost immediately after the assassination, the Israeli nuclear reactor would go critical, creating the conditions for the weapons grade plutonium isotope, with Israel obtaining nuclear weapons nearly one year later with the approval of the replacement president Lyndon B. Johnson.

It is thought that the uranium for the enrichment process came from a plant in Pennsylvania where almost 200 pounds of weapons-grade uranium went ""missing.""

- Other Notable Points -

Another odd occurrence during this day would be the ""Umbrella Man"" who most either consider to have been a Mossad or CIA agent. This man, during a warm clear day in Dallas, TX was wearing a full black suit and hat with an umbrella over his head protecting his identity at a distance. When the shots rang out, this man would seemingly remain unaffected.

The Warren Commission, the commission set up to investigate the killing was created by none other than Lyndon B. Johnson himself, and had been given limited information as the CIA was considered complicit in a cover-up by withholding important information during the investigation.

- My Opinion -

I fully believe that the CIA, LBJ, and Mossad, in a combined effort, ordered and executed the assassination of a sitting president. With the notable individuals involved on that day, and all of the money involved, the data would indicate the involvement of Mossad as a main perpetrator that day. From the building the initial shots were likely fired from, the controversial film, and the council who invited him, they all have one key point in common.

If you have any additional information to share, please comment below and as always, don't take my word for any of this, feel free to fact check and research each point involved in this write-up and come to your own conclusion.

"Living in the UK, want to put my Euros in a savings account. Which one?",UKPersonalFinance,1i883pz,2025-01-23 12:01:58,5,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1i883pz/living_in_the_uk_want_to_put_my_euros_in_a/,Rhymezone,,"I have always lived in the UK, am a dual citizen Italian/British. I was gifted a lump sum, around ‚Ç¨10,000 recently and needed advice on how to store it. I want to keep it as Euros as I feel the exchange rate could get better in the future AND I have a dream to move to the EU in the next 5 years. 

At the moment the euros are just in a Starling Euro account, accruing no interest and I guess losing value due to inflation. I have no immediate use for it as I pay for everything in GBP. 

I was recently introduced to CHIP and have managed to save around ¬£15000 over this year, earning interest from it.

Which leads me to my question:

Is there a way I can put my euros in a similar ISA-type account but for euros, where I can earn interest over the next couple years?
Or is there something else I should be doing with it?"

I am hoping to go car free, or at least very very minimal.

I've been interviewing for jobs and whenever I mention transportation, it's always assumed I will be getting a car eventually, because the 'trains are so expensive'. I've played along in interviews because it's not important to the subject at hand, but it has made me curious.

Is it actually viable? My last interview said the trains can cost hundreds of pounds per month, but doesn't car ownership also cost hundreds of pounds a month? Are these folks just carbrained, or are my expectations unreasonable?

I know england is more car centric than other parts of Europe, but from the hellscape that is car-centric north america, it looks very nice."

My current lineup is:

I am horrible in Heli, so skipping that for now. 

Alphajet is for Ground Pounding trying to avoid loosing CAP points. 

G91 is for CAP when the sky is full of planes. (do have a doubt on this one and consider replacing it with the Mig19S (or should I keep the G91 for its 4 air to air missiles)

My question/advise concern is the KPz-70 and thinking of replacing this with either the Leopard 1A5 or the T-72M1. Reason is I have a real hard time getting the KPz-70 to work and I even do better with the M48 so could be a playstyle thing. Any suggestion is most welcome and appreciated. "

(1996-1999)

A Show Of Hands

A series of short films created and directed by¬†Tim Lagasse, whose work on these shorts led to him being cast as the title character in the similar series¬†[*Oobi*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Oobi). Lagasse was also the lead puppet performer. The films each span about one minute and feature professional puppeteers' hands acting like people. (1992-1999)

The series was created by¬†Mo Willems, who would later create the Cartoon Network television series¬†*Sheep in the Big City*. One of the similarities between the two shows was the distinct art style, which was mainly a lot of flat, dry colors and characters that moved with clothing patterns that don't. The animation was also similar to that of early UPA, Curious Pictures and Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but mostly, the series itself (especially in story and concept) hearkened back to the classic¬†*Peanuts*¬†TV specials, especially since the majority of the voice cast are children actors. Each episode is scored with a jazz soundtrack, similar to the music in¬†*The Pink Panther*¬†cartoon shorts. The soundtrack sometimes features big-band music, but mostly features a simple combination of a piano, drums and a double bass. Each segment ran for two to four minutes.

The show was the first to end in KaBlam due to Mo Willems moving to Cartoon Network Studios to work on¬†*Sheep in the Big City*. (1995-1998)

The shorts spotlighted the titular Safety Queen (voiced by¬†[Katrina Johnson](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Katrina_Johnson)¬†of¬†[*All That*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/All_That)), a redheaded girl who wears safety gear and travels by pogo stick. Each of the shorts followed this formula: Safety Queen would see that a kid her age is in a dilemma of some sort and would arrive on the scene to examine the problem. Safety Queen would tell them¬†*not*¬†to go through with what they're about to do, giving some ludicrous explanation as to why and claiming the outcome will be ""very unsafe."" The kid would end up doing the action in question, after realizing how unreasonable their problem was. All three of the¬†*Safety Queen*¬†shorts were included on the¬†*Rugrats: Phil and Lil - Double Trouble*¬†VHS in 1996 (as well as on Blockbuster Video's¬†*Rugrats: Volume 3*¬†Kidmongous VHS, which contained the contents of the former tape).

An animation short created by Michael Pearlstein of Funbag Animation Studios that ran during the first three seasons of¬†[*KaBlam!*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/KaBlam!)¬†The short originally began with a pilot that aired in¬†[1992](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/1992)¬†titled ""Psyched for Snuppa"", about two ferrets who often get on each other's nerves. (1996-1999)

A Show Of Hands

A series of short films created and directed by¬†[Tim Lagasse](), whose work on these shorts led to him being cast as the title character in the similar series¬†[*Oobi*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Oobi). Lagasse was also the lead puppet performer. The films each span about one minute and feature professional puppeteers' hands acting like people. (1992-1999)

The shorts premiered on¬†[Nickelodeon](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon)¬†in 1993 and continued to be shown between programs as late as 1997. They received a variety of awards, including a Citation for Excellence from¬†[UNIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIMA)¬†and a silver award from Broadcast Design International.[^(\[1\])](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/A_Show_of_Hands#cite_note-1)[^(\[2\])](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/A_Show_of_Hands#cite_note-2)¬†The series is notable for its many similarities to¬†*Oobi*, mainly the use of bare-hand puppets as characters.

As Our School Bus Turns

An interstitial series on¬†[Nickelodeon](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon), parodying the soap opera¬†[*As the World Turns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_World_Turns). The shorts later served as the inspiration for a pilot of a half-hour series called¬†*Bus No. 9*, which was only shown once and never picked up for series. 1995-1998

The Off-Beats

They nervous, they nebbish, they small,And the Populars don't like 'em at all.But that's ok, life is sweet.They cool. They the Off-Beats. (originally called¬†***The Misfits***) A series of animated shorts appearing on the¬†[Nickelodeon](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon)¬†television series¬†[*KaBlam!*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/KaBlam!)¬†(originally in between-shows as standalone segments), featuring the lives of a clique of nerdy individuals, each having their own quirks. The series was created by¬†[Mo Willems](), who would later create the Cartoon Network television series¬†*Sheep in the Big City*. One of the similarities between the two shows was the distinct art style, which was mainly a lot of flat, dry colors and characters that moved with clothing patterns that don't. The animation was also similar to that of early UPA, Curious Pictures and Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but mostly, the series itself (especially in story and concept) hearkened back to the classic¬†*Peanuts*¬†TV specials, especially since the majority of the voice cast are children actors. Each episode is scored with a jazz soundtrack, similar to the music in¬†*The Pink Panther*¬†cartoon shorts. The soundtrack sometimes features big-band music, but mostly features a simple combination of a piano, drums and a double bass. Each segment ran for two to four minutes.

The show was the first to end in KaBlam due to Mo Willems moving to Cartoon Network Studios to work on¬†*Sheep in the Big City*. (1995-1998)

The Non-Adventures Of Safety Queen

¬†When kids are in trouble it can only mean...: ""This is a job for...SAFETY QUEEN!"" A series of mini-shorts aired between shows on¬†[Nickelodeon](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon)¬†from¬†[1995](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/1995)¬†to¬†[1996](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/1996).

The shorts spotlighted the titular Safety Queen (voiced by¬†[Katrina Johnson](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/Katrina_Johnson)¬†of¬†[*All That*](https://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/All_That)), a redheaded girl who wears safety gear and travels by pogo stick. Each of the shorts followed this formula: Safety Queen would see that a kid her age is in a dilemma of some sort and would arrive on the scene to examine the problem. Safety Queen would tell them¬†*not*¬†to go through with what they're about to do, giving some ludicrous explanation as to why and claiming the outcome will be ""very unsafe."" The kid would end up doing the action in question, after realizing how unreasonable their problem was. All three of the¬†*Safety Queen*¬†shorts were included on the¬†*Rugrats: Phil and Lil - Double Trouble*¬†VHS in 1996 (as well as on Blockbuster Video's¬†*Rugrats: Volume 3*¬†Kidmongous VHS, which contained the contents of the former tape).

Later years, The Splat's YouTube channel had added with some shorts.

Nicktoons Network Shorts:

A long time ago, when wrestlers wore speedos and had back hair, the four corners of the thumb wrestling ring were a place of heroic deeds, of fair competition, of honour. The brackets were made, the bells polished and rung, and the scores kept, all by the wise thumbs of the Thumb Wrestling Federation. The TWF was presided over by Newt Knuckle, one of the sports pioneers and its elder statesman. All was A okay, thumbs up! the old timers would say with a glint in their nails. Thumbs up that is, until a young upstart named Page Boy Skull decided to give the whole thing the finger. Page Boy Skull was a young man in a hurry. He didnt read the record books, and he didnt respect the old timers, the greats that built the sport, thumbs like Newt Knuckle, Colonel Cossack, and Phineas D. Finger. Page Boy Skull didnt want to work his way through the brackets by wrestling exhibition bouts in places like Thumboldt, Texas and Thumbleweed, Montana. Page Boy Skull didnt have the time. He wanted it all control of the TWF and he wanted it now. When Newt Knuckle thumbed his nose at Page Boy Skulls demand to be included on the Thumb Wrestling Federations governing council, Skull led a revolt In a tragedy that rivaled the Great Thumb Fire of 1881 and split the TW in two. Those with respect and with honor joined the Mighty Dexteras. Those with less than a thimble full of decency joined the evil Sinistras. In the ensuing turmoil, Newt Knuckle and Phineas D. Finger disappeared while other old timers like Colonel Cossack threw in the towel. Renaming himself to reflect his newly acquired status, Page Boy Skull became Senator Skull, leader of the Sinistras. As wrestlers battle to fill the power vacuum left by the disappearance of the TWF Legends, Senator Skull and the Sinistras will stop at nothing to defeat the Mighty Dexteras, take over the Thumb Wrestling Federation and perhaps the world! Its just a regular Monday night at the TWF! DEXTERAS, SINISTRAS, LETS THUMBLE!

Staying near Heathrow for 16 day London trip?,uktravel,1i7ndbc,2025-01-22 17:04:49,0,0.5,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1i7ndbc/staying_near_heathrow_for_16_day_london_trip/,booklover68,Travel Question,"I am planning a trip to London with a friend in early May for 16 days. We are both highly particular about hotels, and our dollar (Canadian dollar) is currently very weak compared to the British pound (about $1.80 CAD to ¬£1 GPB).   
  
Many hotels in central London don't seem to have two beds, or the rooms with two beds are much more expensive. To save money and ensure the room is a decent size with two beds, we're considering staying at the Renaissance Hotel at Heathrow. This would be about a 45 minute-1 hour commute into the city each day. The room would be ¬£123 per night, including breakfast for two, so ¬£1,972.00 GBP, or $3,485.96 CAD, total for the trip.   
  
Google Maps shows that there's a bus line a two minute walk from the hotel that will take us to the Elizabeth line and from there into Central London. This would cost between ¬£5-¬£6 each way for each of us (bus fare + tube fare).

Does this make sense to do? Our itinerary is all over the city; we have one day planned at the Tower of London, one day for St. Paul's/Shakespeare's Globe, two days in Covent Garden, three days in Westminster, one day in Camden Town, one day in Notting Hill/Kensington, and one day in Canary Wharf. We are also planning to do one day at Windsor Castle, one day at Hampton Court, one day at Hever Castle, and one day at the Harry Potter Studio Tour. And we are planning to see probably 5-6 West End shows.

We figured that given that our itinerary is all over the city, we'd end up on transit a lot anyway, and the amount of travel time we'd save staying more centrally would not be proportionate to the increased cost (likely close to double the cost, given how particular we are about hotels and that we want the extra space). We are also Marriott Titanium members and therefore usually receive very good service and sometimes upgrades from Marriotts (including Renaissance properties), especially internationally; the Renaissance also has a club lounge we'd have access to with food, snacks, and drinks.   
  
We'd prefer to stay at a Marriott brand hotel, but the Marriotts located more centrally are either double the price or extremely small (we were looking at the Moxy in Stratford, but it's ¬£40 more and doesn't even have a wardrobe for us to hang clothes, which for a 16 day trip would not be ideal).

Does it make sense to stay at the Renaissance Heathrow given these circumstances? Our only concern is that we might be quite tired after a long day and getting back on the tube to the hotel, especially if we're seeing shows that don't finish until 10:30 or so. We wouldn't get back to the hotel until 11:30 or later in that case, and we don't want to be tired throughout our trip. "

The water was black water so he got the carpet outside and he was using a hosepipe with cold water. No detergent and he only spoke English when it suited him. He had buildings but no contents insurance as he'd just bought the property but he insisted on keeping it all saying it would be fine. She was a nurse and whatever he said, she followed.  The head of the Fire Service came down and told him he'd condemn the house if they moved back in and he suddenly couldn't speak English again.  The head of the fire service wasn't having this, condemned the house as she was about to pop and it was filthy, there was no where to sit, cook etc and she was lovely, amenable and embarrassed by him but culturally she had to do as she was told. 

I started up a collection for her and the baby and I collared everyone for a few quid as they didn't have nappies, baby grows etc. We got a good few hundred pounds and went out and got the basics, but he was tamping, not that he saw it as charity but it was given to her and not him as the 'man of the house'.  That night her waters broke and he had a 4x4 but was too busy to take her to the hoapital and we still couldn't get in and out of our road with a normal car so I rang the fire brigade and the head man himself came out.  The dad wanted a home birth (not happening, no running hot water or anything else needed) so they took her to hospital where it was agreed she'd stay in for a few days.  We worked out what else she needed so we got towels, a basinette, a first aid kit, bed linen for it. A friend with running water (we had no running water for a week and electricity was sporadic) washed it all and the council got a place for her to go till their   He kicked off, how dare they be separated (he could have gone with her), she couldn't cook or wash for him (yup seriously), every day was stressful as we had a 2 year old but we sorted out a flat to rent, had to get furniture as ours has all been in black water, so we'd drop our son as t nursery and started the clean up as the water finally came back on and I found out where she was living and went around with everything, a card as I got everyone to sign it and as she was all alone and he was deliberately being an ass - he hadn't even been round to see them.

Eventually they moved back in and a lot of charities got together to get new carpet, second hand furniture he sneered at.  The man was vile. 

As the years went by she started to change and wanted everything for nothing but he was looking after her daughter one day and she fell in the brook, the same one that did the damage to all our houses.  I called Social Services and I did it as I was racist. He nearly burnt all the back of the house as despite being by a brook, we'd had no rain for weeks, the brook was all but empty and the grass was dry as a bone and he started a bonfire and had it have take hold, the lot would have gone up. My busband called him a stupid idiot and he called the police again for us being racist and what we'd been accused of was vile.  Luckily the wonders of CCTV proved him wrong and they'd had a lot of complaints about him over the years as when he didn't get his own way, you were racist.  They finally arrested him, only for wasting police time but they'd agreed to pay for our joint fence as their son broke it, when it came time for payment they couldn't pay as they were ""Christians"".  We went to court and remember that CCTV, well unbeknownst to us, when they agreed to pay they said quite a bit in their own language that they'd never pay us and a lot of white British slurs.  They tried to say it was a misunderstanding and then the Judge read out what they'd said in English, that we were all these vile names.  The Judge already had the Police there and he was charged with (paraphrasing here as it was quite a few charges) lying, fraud, being racist and something else I can't remember.  They never did come back to our street, they'd bought another house (so much for being skint), they were having monthly visits by Social Services by the way he'd treated his kids as he genuinely didn't see that he'd done anything wrong.  Embarrassing for her as she was a paediatric nurse and had to move to a different department.  All this because you try and do a good thing and the person thinks they're omnipotent.

Would I ever do anything nice again? Yes, I have and will continue to do so as why should one family ruin it for others?  There are all sorts in this world and unfortunately this one wasn't a good experience but watching us help an 18 year old move into a 1 bedroomed flat (for now) and we could help with furniture, saucepans, bedkinen etc, the cake she made to say thank you was the best I'd ever had üòä"

# Morning KILL Zone (London Session)

The day starts with the London session, known for its high volatility. The best assets to trade during this time are:

* **EUR/USD**: The Euro is actively traded at the start of the day.
* **GBP/USD**: The British Pound also initiates significant market movements.
* **EUR/GBP**: A cross rate between two strong economies.
* **GER 40**: The German index, which is particularly active during the European session.

These pairs and instruments usually experience dynamic movements due to the release of important economic data and the activity of European traders.

# Daytime KILL Zone (New York Session)

When America wakes up, the market gets a new boost. The best assets for this zone include:

* **USD/JPY**: The US Dollar against the Japanese Yen is especially active due to the overlap of sessions.
* **USD/CAD**: The Canadian Dollar reacts to oil prices and news from the US.
* **S&P 500**: If you trade indices, the daytime zone is perfect for analysis.
* **NASDAQ**: The US technology index shows strong movements during the daytime session.

The daytime session is particularly attractive to traders because US news events can significantly influence the market.

# Evening KILL Zone (Pacific Session)

During this time, the market becomes less volatile, but that doesn‚Äôt mean trading is pointless. In the evening, you can focus on:

* **AUD/USD**: The Australian Dollar is active due to the opening of Asian markets.
* **NZD/USD**: The New Zealand Dollar demonstrates good movements.
* **USD/JPY**: This pair continues to be popular even during the Pacific session.

Despite the quieter dynamics, the evening zone can be suitable for more relaxed trading and finding setups with lower risk.

# Conclusion

This is my personal opinion and approach to trading. It‚Äôs how I find it more convenient and enjoyable to work with the market. However, I strongly recommend that you conduct your own backtests and determine which assets and time zones work best for you.

Every trader is unique, and only through experience can you find your ideal strategy. Good luck with your trading, and remember: discipline and analysis always come first!

UK Labour to close Women's Prisons,TheTinMen,1i77p9l,2025-01-22 04:54:11,69,0.99,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTinMen/comments/1i77p9l/uk_labour_to_close_womens_prisons/,TheTinMenBlog,,"Call me ***‚ÄúFAR RIGHT THUG‚Äù,*** but if this isn't ‚Äòtwo tier justice', then surely *nothing* is.

[Labour are to rethink prisons.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/21/prisons-minister-aims-to-close-one-womens-jail-in-england-and-wales)

Vowing to end the revolving door of retraumatisation, and to instead rehabilitate inmates, closing prisons altogether... but only... for *women.*

I‚Äôll tell you something ‚Äì

These are the stories that fill me most with despair.

It‚Äôs not the testimony of men's pain that sucks the soul from you, but the stories of success, kindness, and progress, from which they are so unjustly excluded.

Yes, James Timpson, exited the private sector as CEO of Timpson in 2024; to join our political leaders in the familiar mud of self-serving headline grabs, and opportunistic, sabre rattling photo shoots.

It's another heartbreaking lesson.

The lesson, taught this time, I'm ashamed to say, by one of my personal heroes; reminds us that our society *is* in fact capable of change, just seemingly not for men.

Lord Timpson ‚Äì our new Minister of Prisons ‚Äì is to reinvent the way we treat, humanise, and rehabilitate prisoners; but has decided only to extend this policy to the 4% of the prison population, who are women.

Somehow, to exclude 96% of those desperately in need of change, from the very policy that promises to give it to them ‚Äì is 'progressive' politics.

And so, tens of thousands of British men being failed, lost, and traumatised; raped, and abused within prison, are left to languish within a half life of homelessness, addiction, unemployment, and despair.

There is *no doubt* they need help.

But sadly, reform for *male* inmates, just doesn't look good in The Guardian, or on your CV, nor within the fine halls of Westminster.

And so there will be no such help for men in prison.

Why?

Well, you see, to James, women are just *‚Äòdifferent‚Äô* (meaning better), and therefore to keep them caged like animals, rather than free to fly, as the divine creatures they are, is barbaric and must be ended.

Not for men of course.

The men remain locked up.

Ideally thrown into an Eastern European prison if Jess Phillips had her way, but men shackled like animals, within an antiquated system of industrialised abuse, will have to do for now.

Meanwhile ‚Äì women will now be helped out of prison.

Starting with Labour's newly announced 'Women‚Äôs Justice Board'; women behind bars will be given vocational training, therapy, and support, and helped to *'break free from domestic abuse, sexual exploitation, addictions and homelessness.‚Äô*

This sounds wonderful, I'm on board.

But why not for incarcerated men too?

Well I have answers...

James points to research showing a large number of incarcerated women have traumatic brain injuries.

This is true.

But research shows this is also true for an *even greater percentage* of incarcerated men,

James tells us that a lot of women shouldn‚Äôt be in prison, because they are ‚Äòvery ill.‚Äô

This is true.

And yes, it‚Äôs true for men in prison ‚Äì

98% of incarcerated men have at least one Adverse Childhood Experience, and more than half (56%) experienced physical trauma as a child.

James tells us that women in prison often come from violent childhoods, and he's right, they often are.

But again ‚Äì no less true for men in prison either.

James tells us, *'two-thirds of women are imprisoned for non-violent offences‚Äô.*

Again, it's true, 68% of women in prison are indeed there for non-violent crimes.

That number for men is 61%.

James tells us that women in prison are released in to homelessness.

This is true for 19% of such women... and 16% of men.

James tells us that women leaving prison are less likely to reoffend, true again, but the difference is also small, at around 5%.

James tells us a lot of women in prison are mothers, and children need their mums.

And yes they do.

But children also need their dads.

James tells us that,*‚Äòprison doesn't work for women‚Äô.*

...as if prison is doing a stellar job for the guys?

My point here is simple ‚Äì

I don‚Äôt care what performative drivel tumbles from James' mouth, or whatever spectacular somersault of mental gymnastics he performs; the simple fact is, the above disparities are not large enough to justify his wholesale exclusion of men, who make up 19 of every 20 prisoners, from this important, life saving policy.

Whatever tragic truths you can tell me about women's prisons, whatever compelling justification you have for closing them down, save your time, I agree, but I can present the same back to you for men.

So help men too.

There are *thousands* whose lives can be saved by this policy, and they have a right to be helped just as much as any woman.

You are the Minister for Prisons.

You are *not* the Minister for Women.

So do your job.

Your job: which is reducing suffering in prison, for all people, not just those most expedient to your political ambitions.

James, who has built a career, and a hundred-million pound business off the hard work and loyalty of male ex-offenders; employing *thousands* in his stores, knows their character, dedication, and longingness for a second chance, better than anyone.

And yet he seems to betray them all in record time since joining Westminster.

I'll be honest, this is not how I expected his appointment would go, and I feel embarrassed.

I had hoped James would bring change, new life, and new ideas; but so far, it's just more of the same, but this time, in silly glasses."
"Forex Market Update: January 22, 2025",CryptoForexSyndicate,1i76tku,2025-01-22 03:46:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1i76tku/forex_market_update_january_22_2025/,Axiik,,"Global Currency Movements Amid U.S. Trade Policy Developments

The forex market experienced notable fluctuations today, influenced by recent U.S. trade policy announcements and economic indicators from major economies.

**U.S. Dollar (USD) Performance**

The U.S. dollar exhibited a mixed performance against major currencies.

The Dollar Index (DXY) retreated marginally, closing around the 107.60 zone, as investors remained cautious about potential U.S. trade tariffs under President Donald Trump's administration.

**Euro (EUR) and European Central Bank (ECB) Outlook**

The euro strengthened, revisiting levels beyond the 1.0400 mark against the dollar.

This movement aligns with market expectations of the European Central Bank (ECB) potentially cutting interest rates in its upcoming meeting.

The easing of fears regarding U.S. trade tariffs, with President Trump focusing threats on Mexico, Canada, and China, has reinforced expectations of ECB rate cuts to support eurozone growth.

**British Pound (GBP) Dynamics**

The British pound faced downward pressure, falling 0.6% against the rebounding U.S. dollar to $1.2255.

This decline follows a significant rise of 1.3% on Monday.

The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies, particularly potential tariffs on key trading partners, has impacted currencies exposed to trade dynamics.

Additionally, signs of softness in the U.K.'s labor market, with a decline of 47,000 employees in December, have supported expectations of a Bank of England rate cut in February.

**Australian Dollar (AUD) Trends**

The Australian dollar stabilized amid looming U.S. tariff threats.

The currency's performance reflects the market's cautious approach as investors assess the potential impact of U.S. trade policies on global trade dynamics.

**Japanese Yen (JPY) Movements**

The Japanese yen traded in a volatile fashion around the 155.50 zone against the U.S. dollar.

Investors remained cautious in light of the upcoming Bank of Japan meeting and the broader implications of U.S. trade policies on the global economy.

**Canadian Dollar (CAD) Adjustments**

The Canadian dollar rebounded after initially declining against the U.S. dollar.

This movement came as investors evaluated the likelihood of President Trump imposing a significant import tax on Canada.

Despite initial concerns, skepticism about the implementation of these tariffs led to a recovery in the loonie, which traded 0.2% lower at 1.4340 per U.S. dollar after hitting its lowest level since March 2020.

**Insights from TradingView**

Forex traders actively monitored the day's market action using advanced tools on [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/), a popular platform for charting and technical analysis.

Key observed trends included a breakout in the EUR/USD pair above a key resistance level at 1.0400, flagged by several analysts as a bullish signal.

In the GBP/USD market, bearish divergences on the RSI were highlighted, suggesting potential further downside for the pair.

The [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) community remains a hub for collaborative insights, with many users focusing on the implications of central bank decisions and trade policy shifts.

**Market Outlook**

As the global forex market continues to react to policy announcements and economic data, traders are advised to monitor developments closely.

The potential for new trade tariffs and central bank policy decisions will likely influence currency movements in the coming days."
21st January: Robot- Assist Laparoscopic Hysterectomy in London ( private insurance),hysterectomy,1i742if,2025-01-22 00:31:31,8,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1i742if/21st_january_robot_assist_laparoscopic/,2562525625,,"First - thank you all who contributed to this sub. I (45F) read all most popular posts, and almost everything else over the last 3 months. I feel like I've been given a secret weapon of knowledge that made this experience much less traumatic and stressful. 

I've had 7cm of fuckroid + uterus, tubes, and cervix out at 8pm last night. Up around 10 ( apparently I was giggling at the doctors straight after the op, but I have zero recollection of it). My husband was allowed to my (well posh) single room at 10:30 to watch me eat, wee in the bag, and fall asleep. 

Soft plushy kitty cushion was/is amazing on my belly keeping it warm and Fentimans ginger beer took away any nausea if there was any. 

It's 5am now. I had 4 servings of morphine jelly (roughly every 2 hours) overnight and caught some sleep with Terry Pratchett's audio book quietly murmur in my headphones. I'm an insomniac, so that's pretty normal. 

I kept asking for painkillers every time the pain woke me up (roughly every 2 hours - I think that's probably how long morphine sweeties last) and am feeling very reasonable (British for in some moderate pain of 1-2 that I can sleep with) 

I was very very anxious about anaesthesia, but anaestisiologist told me he'll have me out in no time, so he got me a ""cocktail"" intravenously, I did 3 breaths of funny smelling oxygen and then woke up in the aftercare room. 

If the surgeon is happy with my new gender neutral üòú (geddid!?)  state post-op, my husband will get to get me home to our two gender neutral cats in 6-8 hours. We're going to invest into a London black cab ride home, as they have nice high seats, excellent suspension, and drivers who can pick a route with fewest bumps. 

Insurance provided by Aviva paid for my employer and covered 4 consultations with a top surgeon, MRI, blood and other tests before the op without any issue. I submitted all referrals online and paid GBP 150 excess, as this was my first claim for the year. (Plus black cab ride tomorrow, ginger beer, most unsexy comfy underwear and a bralette, joggers, and pink jumper). 

For the surgery I wore (read this in a sexy MasterChef voice) a 3M knee-length purple paper gown with easy access and ventilation on the back by not having one, dark blue DVT prevention stockings going up to the knee, with sexy holes for your toes, electric blue non-slip socks, and an abomination onto taste and function that were disposable knickers ( that I woke up without, but with a catheter that I actually can't feel)... 

Damn... Long post - this morphine sweeties must be good. Hope this will be helpful to someone like me. Peace, love, and hysterectomy for all üíö‚ù§Ô∏èüíö"
The opening scene of The Gentlemen (2019) is the perfect example of how you sell a movie in 90 seconds or less.,movies,1i732gn,2025-01-21 23:32:56,206,0.82,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i732gn/the_opening_scene_of_the_gentlemen_2019_is_the/,BackToTheFutureDoc,Discussion,"I can't get over how good this film is. Some will agree and others will disagree, that's movie opinions 101 but I have to talk about it to anyone that will want to listen or read about what I have to say.

Especially that opening scene. It sets the film up superbly and it lasts 90 seconds long before setting off into the intro credits, Guy Ritchie couldn't have chosen a more appropriate song if he tried. It fits just right when you notice that the lyrics and the metaphors are mirrored and shown off in this movie.

We have to remember that this is mostly being told as a ""true"" story by Fletcher (Hugh Grant) through his eyes and what he knows and the rest he has put together as he is looking to sell it as a script to a film studio but simultaneously looking to blackmail and sell what he knows to the right hand man Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam), the right hand man of Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey).

Film begins with Mickey Pearson ordering a pint and a pickled egg, goes to the machine and selects the 'Cumberland Gap' as his song choice, sits down, calls his wife to confirm date night whilst she's at work, the time and place to meet only to overhear someone, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) in the background refusing to leave and fears his wife (Michelle Dockery) is being threatened and in danger, only for a mysterious hidden man appear behind Mickey Pearson at the same time and then we hear a gunshot but don't see the shooting, the blood splatters on to the pint and pickled egg and roll intro credits.

Again all of this happen within the 90 second intro but man oh man that's how you sell it, that's how you draw your audience in. 

An American in a London pub that orders a pint and pickled egg, portrayed by a mainstream leading man, right song choice selected on the machine, mystery man with a gun stood behind the protagonist and he shoots and we see nothing except the blood splatter. And the last thing we do hear before the gun was fired? His wife in danger on the other end of the phone and he couldn't be there. 

So is it a set up, a double cross, how did this main character get killed, who was the guy who killed him and why? You have to watch to find out and how can you not watch after the 'Cumberland Gap' by David Rawlings starts playing? You're in. Roll intro credits. We're in for a good one.

A strong leading cast. No one takes away from anyone, everyone looks strong and the film flows really well.

Hugh Grant was phenomenal in this film, a very different side of him I've never seen before, anyone familiar with the British TV Soap EastEnders will know of the character ""Dirty"" Den Watts portrayed by the late Leslie Grantham, he reminded me of him so many times with his mannerisms, verbiage and characteristics. I need more leading roles for this man, he clearly has the range, experience, just hope a director will let him or ask him to be the meticulous bargaining selfish comedic but smart villain again. It's exactly what we got here and he almost got away with it after already getting away with it after the Russians were going to attack Raymond and him before Coach made the save.

Matthew McConaughey again deserving leading man in this film as he executed his role perfectly, his love for his wife transcended everything despite throughout the film a theme being the money and business being his first priority. When he exclaims and shouts ""MY WIFE!"" it's the first and only time we see emotion from him, it's all he ever cared about really.

Charlie Hunnam didn't look out of place, a great right hand man, the wardrobe department deserves a backdated raise because he looked outstanding. Looks posh, well dressed, well spoken, clearly educated but easily got his hands dirty when needed in this business and for his boss. The ideal right hand man. 

The way he was one step ahead of Fletcher the whole time, opening the bottle of alcohol, cooking him a wagyu steak and telling him to take his shoes off when he goes to use the toilet, he didn't get this far with Mickey without reason. Genuinely one of my favourite right hand man portrayals. The way he tries to reason with the teenagers for their phones, the drugs in the apartment before having to use just enough show of power, strength and put fear into them that he is someone not to be messed with or taken lightly.

Throw in Colin Farrell as Coach with the toddlers and his I'm indebted to you role. The 3 strikes was a smart way of letting the audience as well as Raymond know that I'm fulfilling my role and you're running out of favours from me and by the film came to an end, Raymond now owes him a strike, a debt and a favour.

Jeremy Strong was the right person to play Matthew Berger. A backstabbing conniving sleazeball with no care for anyone but himself. It was a joy to see the way his plan fails, falls apart and unravels in front of him when Mickey tells him he owes him 270m for the losses incurred and all transgressions occured, after that he will not sell his business to him as previously agreed and finally on top of that Matthew owes Mickey a literal pound of flesh, from any part of his body but if he is a penny short for the the 270m transaction or a gram shy for the pound of flesh, he will not make it out of that freezer alive.

Jeremy Strong sold it just right when he realises he is screwed, so well that you don't feel sorry for him but you buy his fear and ""I'm going to die aren't I?"" realisation on his face without him needing to say a word.

The plot twist at the end with the Russians looking to exact revenge on Mickey Pearson for something he didn't even cause or intended when Aslan was accidentally killed in the task to get Laura Pressfield, daughter of one of the lords back, only for the toddlers to accidentally save Mickey Pearson when they were trying to kill him to get rid of Coach's problem and strikes of being indebted to Mickey and Raymond after they infiltrated one of his bases. 

I could go on and on about the characters, the actors portrayal, specific scenes but you get the long winded gist of this praise. I think it will develop a bigger following if it hasn't already. 

Sets up the potential of a movie sequel (yes I'm aware of the TV show) and what better way to introduce Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones to the story? Can be a parent of one of the toddlers, the boss of Coach or someone else who wants to buy Mickey's empire. Somehow some way I believe Guy Ritchie could pull it off and do it. 

I understand this film was released just before COVID hit in early 2020 so it may have gone under the radar for a while especially given the circumstances at the time but I truly believe this was/is a gem by Guy Ritchie that would've won major awards for certain actors.

Or maybe I'm just behind on the movie as it was released just over 5 years ago. And that's ok, I just wanted to share how great it was watching this film and my experience."

Early signs indicate that the U.S. government's comprehensive sanctions on Russian oil trade are taking effect, with Russia‚Äôs seaborne crude exports recording their largest decline since November last week. According to compiled ship-tracking data, export levels fell, keeping the less volatile four-week average below 3 million barrels per day for the fourth consecutive week, nearing a 16-month low. Ship-tracking data and port agent reports show that as of the week ending January 19, 26 tankers carried 19.26 million barrels of Russian crude, down from 27 tankers and 21.06 million barrels the previous week. Over the seven days ending January 19, daily crude flows fell by approximately 260,000 barrels to 2.75 million barrels, a 9% decline.

**U.S. Senate Finance Committee Approves Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary**  
On January 21, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee voted 16-11 to approve the nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary under the Trump administration, advancing the nomination to the Senate for final confirmation. If approved, Bessent will become a key spokesperson for the new administration's economic policies, wielding significant influence over fiscal policy, financial regulation, international sanctions, and foreign investments.

**Comprehensive Tariffs Could Deal a 3% Blow to Canada‚Äôs Economy**  
A report by CIBC estimates that comprehensive U.S. tariffs could cost Canada‚Äôs economy up to 3.25%, even with exemptions for the oil and gas sector. The report explores four scenarios for tariffs on Canadian imports, with rates ranging from 10% to 20%, and potential exemptions for key industries.

Trump stated Monday night that he is considering imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico starting February 1. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a response, noting that ""everything is on the table."" According to CIBC, a 20% tariff excluding commodities, which account for nearly half of Canada‚Äôs exports to the U.S., would still lead to a 3.25% GDP contraction. In a more conservative scenario with a 10% tariff excluding commodities and the auto sector, the economic impact would be around 1.35%. The report suggests the Trump administration may avoid targeting industries closely integrated with Canadian counterparts due to potential job losses in the U.S., conflicts with Trump‚Äôs cheap energy policies, and significant inflationary effects.

**Tariff Concerns Overshadow Inflation, Giving Bank of Canada Reason to Cut Rates Next Week**  
Doug Porter, Chief Economist at BMO Capital Markets, said that President Trump‚Äôs threat to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports starting February 1 outweighs any concerns Canadian policymakers might have about underlying price increases. He noted that last month‚Äôs temporary sales tax holiday ‚Äúclearly slowed overall inflation.‚Äù While the Bank of Canada‚Äôs preferred core metrics have an annualized three-month rate exceeding 3%, or the upper range of the central bank‚Äôs target, Porter argued that the heavy shadow of trade uncertainty eclipses all other factors, making a rate cut part of risk management.

**Canada‚Äôs Inflation Slows to 1.8% Due to Trudeau‚Äôs Temporary Sales Tax Waiver**  
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday that the CPI slowed for the second consecutive month in December, rising 1.8% year-over-year, down from 1.9% previously. The main driver was Trudeau‚Äôs temporary federal sales tax exemption on certain goods starting December 14, which lowered prices for restaurant food and alcoholic beverages during the tax holiday lasting through February 15. Excluding items covered by the tax waiver, which make up about 10% of the CPI basket, overall CPI growth might accelerate to 2.3%, still within the central bank‚Äôs 1%-3% target range.

Separately, New Zealand Statistics reported Wednesday that Q4 CPI rose 2.2% year-over-year, unchanged from Q3.

**Trump‚Äôs Policies Trigger Market Volatility as Dollar and Futures Rebound Sharply**  
On Tuesday, the U.S. dollar rebounded 0.64% to 108.69, though it failed to recover from Monday‚Äôs record 1.2% drop. Following Trump‚Äôs return to the presidency and his proposal to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the Mexican peso fell 1.3%, and the Canadian dollar hit a five-year low. The euro declined 0.62%, while the British pound fell 0.67%. U.S. futures markets rose, with Nasdaq futures up 0.56% and S&P 500 futures up 0.49%. European markets saw modest gains, with the STOXX 600 rising 0.16%, although Germany‚Äôs DAX fell 0.1%. U.S. Treasury yields fell 4 basis points to 4.57%. Trump claimed the tariffs and energy exports would reduce the U.S.-EU trade deficit."

Your finding requests a five billion surcharge for combat operations.*

*Under the present circumstance, I support your administration's decision to deploy the bulk of the 4th Infantry Division to secure their side of the Bridge. However, we are growing concerned about an escalating military build-up against this unknown enemy.*

*You already know that the War Powers Resolution provides you with sixty days before you are required to withdraw without congressional approval. I am willing to push through an AUMF (authorization for use of military force) within the next week; however, we have conditions. This House will not provide another blind AUMF to the White House for risk of unintended abuse.*

*I proposed the proposed AUMF with Vice President John C. Shaw. The United States will be authorized to utilize as many military personnel as necessary to defend the Temple of Indolass. Shaw Convinced me of your position that Salva is important for our short‚Äîand long-term goals on the alien moon. The defense of Salva and the surrounding areas, including the bulk of the surrounding region, will be included in the authorization. However, operations outside the host region must be negotiated later.*

*I know you will disagree with this ""red tape""; however, this country has had too many use-of-force authorizations for one situation before unintentionally expanding into other theaters. Examples are the War on Terror and the Cartel War in Central America.*

*I have talked with Senate Majority Sarah Reed, and they have agreed to take the lead regarding AUMF oversight in addition to their foreign relations with these alien civilizations. She understands that the current situation is in flux, with the military being forced to react to unknown situations without following traditional structure. However, that grace will not last as she and I expect a report on how The Pentagon's command structure will be needed so we can properly evaluate, add comments, and allocate proper resources.*

*We expect consent updates on this developing situation if you wish further funding and material support."" - Speaker of the House Nathaniel Trenton*

Watching the two teams secure the enemy weapons and process the prisoners, Captain Mathew Ryder was still shocked that they were correct about finding their people here. It was such a gamble, and yet, they were accurate. Thrilled that they could reach this base in time to save their people, it was only a pyrrhic victory if they missed half of them.

""I still have to say,"" King said. ""I can't believe the little Brat was right.""

""That's a good thing,"" Ryder said. ""But we could have gotten here in time to save everyone if I had not been asleep.""

Rommel King touched the Captain's shoulder and said, ""Sir, shut up and take the win. If we didn't show up when we did, no one would have been saved.""

Natilite approached and said, ""And let's remember that you won the first engagement against the Unity. A feat that most cannot claim.""

""True."" Ryder turned to the Valkyrie and said, ""How is Assiaya? Is she okay?""

""She's still in the vehicle,"" Natilite said. I think she's bored and wants to come outside.""

""Nope,"" Ryder said. ""The place might not be secured, and we will leave soon.""

""I will see what I can do to speed things up,"" King said. ""There is a good chance that the airship could contact their superiors about what happened.""

The Warrant Officer walked away to assist with the prisoner processing. However, Ryder noticed the Templar smirking at him with her right hand on her hip. ""Excuse me?""

""Oh, nothing,"" Natilite said. ""Just remembering our conversation when we first met.""

Ryder stared at her with confusion. He struggled to recall what they spoke of, feeling like a lifetime ago. The Captain recalled something about life and helping with handling the Salva militia. Still, it came to mind that it related to their current situation. ""And I'm missing something?""

Natilite crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, sighing with disappointment. ""Men. They hate being nagged, and yet... I am just happy that you are happy.""

Wondering what he did to piss her off, the Captain was thrilled when he heard his name being called, as he wanted to get away as quickly as possible. It was Sergeant Ford who was seeking his time. ""Excuse me.""

""Fine,"" Natilite said before heading toward Fraeya.

Confused by the reaction, Ryder walked toward his Sergeant. ""Everything okay?""

""I could say the same thing to you,"" Ford said. ""It seems like we are both in trouble.""

Ryder crossed his arms, already knowing the direction of this conversation.

""Fraeya,"" Ford said. ""She hates me.""

""Of course she does,"" Ryder said. ""I want you to understand this, though: you did the right thing. I ordered her not to do what she did; however, I understand why. It is not easy to lose a loved one.""

""Greg told me what happened about your wife,"" Ford said. ""I am sorry for your loss.""

Ryder looked at the Sergeant, staring into his eyes. ""Thank God every day that you do not understand the feeling."" He then turned and saw Fraeya sitting on a barrel with Natilite beside her, comforting the elf girl. ""Regarding Fraeya, she will hate you for now, but do not stress it. Let the emotions run their course, and in time, she will agree that you were right to stop her.""

""And if she doesn't?""

""Have faith. I know it is not easy, but remember, you did the right thing, and at the end of the day, that is all we can hope to do.""

Ford glanced down and took a deep breath. ""Thank you, sir.""

""Good,"" Ryder said. ""Now, follow me. I must speak with a Colonel.""

The Captain patted the Sergeant on the back and headed to the assembly area. A combination of American and British soldiers guarded the hundred and thirteen freed prisoners as they were being processed. They needed to know who they were bringing back to Salva and how to work out the logistics of getting back to Salva.

Most prisoners seemed to be natives, resistance members, political opponents, people who opposed the Katra, etc. Only twenty-eight were from Earth. Besides the one Frenchman, the rest were USAM members. Most were American: three were Brits, four were Japanese, and all the non-Americans were civilians, scientists, and engineers.

The Space Force Colonel stood on the side, speaking with Captain Webster. The Brit informed the officer about how they stormed this base and the situation at Salva. The two men noticed Ryder approaching and acknowledged him.

""It sounds like you guys been through hell. I am Colonel Robert, head of security.""

""Roger that, Colonel. Captain Ryder, CFT-1 of the Minutemen.""

""Thank you, Captain,"" Robert said. ""I recall hearing about your team before everything went to hell. I see that you have the elf girl from First Contact.""

""That is correct,"" Ryder said. ""We learned early on that the enemy was after her and her father. We were able to prevent the Verliance Aristocracy from getting her but failed to save the father. The plan was to save him and the rest of the prisoners.""

""I figured that out,"" Robert said. They loaded them up this morning and were preparing to load us when you attacked. They split us into two groups: priority and non-priority. I think you can figure out who was the priority.""

""That is not good,"" Ryder said. ""It means the enemy will gain a good insight into us while we know nothing about them.""

""Don't think about that right now,"" Robert said. ""We must think about the task at hand. How are we going to get out of here, Captain?""

Ryder stared at the Colonel with confusion. ""Sir? You are not taking command?""

""Not today, Captain,"" Robert said. ""I do not know the tactical and operational situation to lead. You are in command, Captain. I will deal with the prisoners; you two will get us home.""

""Roger that, sir.""

The two captains saluted the Colonel before he left.

Ryder then turned to the British Captain and asked, ""Do you have any ideas how we will move all these people? Not everyone is going to fit on the three Deuce.""

""I had a feeling,"" Webster said. ""One of my men noticed a couple of metal wagons made by the office building.""

""A metal wagon?""

""That is what I said. I saw a few. We could strap them to our vehicles and pull them. Being metal, they might be sturdy enough.""

""Not the worst idea since we came here. It is better than walking, but it will restrict our mobility if we encounter the enemy. They must know what we have done by now.""

As the two agreed on the plan, Webster turned toward a pier and said, ""When you were captured, did everything seem backward?""

""What do you mean?"" Ryder asked.

""I mean,"" Webster said. ""They have lifts powered by gravity, electromagnetically technology, and freaking ships that fly. And yet, they use wagons, and their computers would embarrass my great-grandfather and ride animals. Everything is made from stone, and their vehicles ‚Äì while not to be underestimated still seemed to lack the utility of ours.""

Ryder remembered the British Officer's points when he was a prisoner at Forlace. He noted how much of the layout seemed to need to catch up to their technology. ""You are correct. They had gas pipes within the walls but wouldn't pass inspection on Earth. The doors were not like you would expect at a military facility. Even the Adventures who were chasing me were baffling. Their equipment was a mixture of what we had five hundred years ago and what we might have a hundred years from now. I had to run around with one of their circiletum when I was being hunted. One hell of a punch, but I had to bolt-act it after every shot.""

""Maybe because of the complexity?"" Webster said.

""There definitely seems to be an imbalance,"" Ryder said.

Before Ryder could continue, he noticed the Redcoat captain listening to his radio. His reaction was concerning, as it seemed the report was not good. *""What is the problem?""*

Webster turned to the Comanche captain.¬†*""There is a situation outside. The enemy has arrived.""*

""This quickly?"" Ryder said, shocked by the news. ""Gather your team and head to the entrance.""

The two teams rushed through the facility after informing Colonel Robert to evacuate the prisoners. They headed down the path they came on.

Once outside, Ryder saw four Redcoats in the defensive position, using the vehicles as protection. To his surprise, the enemy had yet to attack their position. The two teams exited the mountain and fanned out to prepare for an attack.

Ryder looked out and saw a company of enemy forces at the tree line. What concerned him was the airship above the Unity infantry.

Unlike the large galley they saw inside the mountain, this was much smaller, closer to a Chinook-heavy helicopter in size. The sides had the same glowing thrusters as the galley but on a smaller scale, meaning maneuverability was typical. The top was organic and smothered, while the base was ridged. The underside of the aircraft glowered due to the cargo gravity lift inside the port, and two individuals floated down. From this distance, it looked like a male and female approaching their position. The overall design resembled a seagoing vessel with a printed front and a flat rear.

""What is that?"" Ryder asked.

""It is an Orgat-type airship,"" Natilite said. ""The Unity uses them to move troops and supplies quickly throughout the battlefield.""

""A heavy utility aircraft,"" Barrett said.

""What is the plan, sir?"" King asked.

Before Ryder could respond, he saw an additional airship between them and the enemy. This one was thinner, looking closer to a dart than a bulky aircraft. Weapons were visible underneath it, like an Apache attack helicopter. Natilite informed them that it was an Akilla-type airship, a terror to all those who fight on the ground.

""It looks like they want to talk,"" Barrett said.

Ryder turned to his team and said, ""Stay here and prepare to break for the tree line. I will see if I can give you more time.""

""Sir?"" King said.

Webster approached and said, ""You are not in the condition to go do something crazy.""

""That is exactly why,"" Ryder said. ""There is no point in putting a healthy office in danger for a wounded one. If things go south, which they probably will, you must get everyone out of here. Besides, Ghost is still out there, so if I have any luck, maybe I can buy time. I seem to have a knack for getting on people's nerves on this Moon.""

""Understood,"" Webster said.

""Let me come with you,"" Natilite said. As a Templar, I would be a show of force.""

""That is why you shouldn't come,"" Ryder said. ""I want them to think they are stronger than us. It might make them feel less aggressive as they have all the cards. Time is the key.""

""I see what you are planning,"" Barrett said. ""Do you think it would work?""

Ryder turned to his Sergeant First Class and shrugged his shoulders, not knowing what would work. However, the enemy had yet to give him many options. They could either open fire or accept the offer to talk.

As everyone prepared, Ryder walked past the vehicles. He saw Assiaya in one of them and told her to stay inside, to which she complied.

The Captain had to travel quite a distance before reaching the two Unity representatives, which left him uncomfortable being this far from his team. He could feel his heart pounding from fear, not knowing what might happen.

The two Unity representatives were an Orc and a Dark Elf. The Orc was in cyan color metal armor with a vest holding pouches and ammunition. Crystal and amulets attached to his armor. The Dark Elf was a female wearing a red and black dress, looking more like a religious figure than someone in the military. The clothing seemed highly designed with the finest silk, clearly stating her position.

The other striking thing was the type of elf, taking dark to a new meaning. noble elves fine-white, while the wood elves he had seen were tan. This being the first elf of this kind, her skin was dark, a hybrid of purple and black. The eyes were black with a yellow ring around the iris. The dark brown hair was long, reaching to the woman's chest.

The Orc pressed a red amulet on his armor, and Ryder felt the same fuzziness. This was the translation amulet that Fraeya had been using.

""To the Altaerrie. I am High Priestess Egharod. You are in the presence of Priestess Itaba of the Temple of Enlightenment. You are trespassing within the Domain and have declared war against the Unity.""

The Captain noticed that the military officer introduced the Priestess with great importance, showing the type of hierarchy within the Unity. These religious folk had tremendous influence within their system, which made sense without how zealot their reputation had been. The closest similarity he could compare to on Earth was the Marxist political officers that the old communist bloc used to have.

""This is just a misunderstanding,"" Ryder said, pointing toward the mountain with his thumb over the shoulder. ""I was sent by the IRS. You are late on your property taxes, and you know the government. Twenty years to fix a pothole but will show armed at your front door if you forgot to pay that ha'penny.""

Itaba laughed as she placed her hand on her chin. ""You are a funny one. It seems you do not understand the gravity of your situation.""

""Oh, I do,"" Ryder said. ""I am married, so I understand when I am in trouble.""

Ryder noticed the Dark Elf glared at him while the Orc chuckled.

""While I like a good sense of humor,"" Egharod said. ""You have attacked our vassal and our mountain base, which is a declaration of war.""

""If I recall, your vassal invaded my country first,"" Ryder said. ""Doesn't that mean technically your people declared war on us?""

The Orc changed his composure into a bolder stance. ""The Katra says that all are within its Domain, including your kind. You barbarians should understand your place if you wish to survive the coming wave.""

""That is a mouthful,"" Ryder replied. ""It's a bold claim to pre-annex your opponent before stepping foot on their territory. I do have to warn you: We have more guns than people, and Texas has been dreaming of that day for two hundred years.""

""It means not,"" Itaba said. ""Do you believe that you are the first to challenge the Katra? Look around you; the Domain is forever growing. All those who opposed it had faltered in its wake. A hundred nations had fallen, with only two remaining on Alagore, and at least there will be peace.""

""Peace after a wave of genocide?"" Ryder said, somewhat dumbfounded. ""I met people like you. Do you think killing ends after you achieve utopia? Nations dedicated their entire civilizations to achieving that goal. Do you know who was waiting at the finish line? The devil himself, smiling with all the corpses you laid below his feet.""

""Your false future is not an excuse for your people's failures,"" Itaba said, lowering her silk hood to her shoulders. ""Only the chosen are allowed to achieve greatness. The rest will be forgotten as they are a stan.""

""Greatness by who? Do you decide? And everyone who disagrees with your path must be cast aside? Let me ask you: What faith would justify that?""

Itaba only chuckled, never losing focus on the Comanche Captain. ""And that is why you are weak. Faith is for those who are directionless. Reality is the true path. What you can see and interact with is correct, and all who prefer fantasy are lost in the shadows of falsehoods.""

Ryder wanted to respond but withheld himself to reflect on what was said as it baffled him. While the Dark Elf Priestess was talking about religion and using that to justify a genocidal crusade, it was not the manner he expected. The Captain assumed the Katra was a faith-based system like on Earth and Teklai; however, she believed it was more practical. While the concept of a God was within their idealogy, it was not a Cosmic force as Natilite described it but something else. He wondered if it was the government as many on Earth would describe it; however, he did not want to assume too much as it could be something alien to his people.

The issue the Captain was hitting was that he needed to be wiser in debating either subject outside the footnotes. The one thing he figured out, though, was that the Dark Elf was measuring him. He was most likely measuring him to gain insight into their new enemies; otherwise, they would have attacked by now.

""The rodent is stuck,"" Egharod said.

""I have been called a pig before but never a rodent,"" Ryder replied. ""I am just baffled by how much work you are going to do just to justify murdering the world. It does not sound like you are confident in your beliefs, but you are scared that the truth might one day break apart your society. You feel a deep desire to silence the reality before the bill comes. Trust me, the bill always comes. Ones who need to control other thoughts are not truthful themselves, so they might silence all who oppose.""

""Those are wise words,"" Itaba said.

""Thanks,"" Ryder replied. ""Got it from a fortune cookie, my boss.""

""Sadly, it means not,"" Itaba said. ""The fool who cannot see should not provide directions to those who wish to follow the path or risk being lost forever. For those who follow the directionless, it is up to us to let go of the shackles of false truths and guide all to Enlightenment.""

""Enlightenment by closing your mind to all spectrums?"" Ryder asked. ""Where I come from, that is closed-minded. It is an echo of what you wish to hear. Closing yourself to all possible paths is directionless. If you're on the wrong lane, you are going the wrong way permanently.""

""Unless you know it is the correct path, then the other paths are the incorrect ones,"" Itaba said. You see Ryder of the Altaerrie. There was a time when the five nations of Cordinlane were considered a backwater, a forgotten land overlooked compared to the ones on Aldrida. However, a day came when we discovered Enlightenment‚Äîscience, taumaturgy, philosophy, and, most importantly, unity. With Katra's guidance, we accomplished nothing others had‚Äîtogether, as one people.

""You see,"" Itaba continued. ""We do not need faith to know the correct path to walk upon. It would be selfish not to spread these glories to the rest of Alagore, ripping off the false Mother who had abandoned us long ago. The Katra will end hunger, wars, discrimination, and all ills of the false paths.""

""I will admit,"" Ryder said. ""That is very well said. Do you practice that speech nightly?""

Egharod stepped forward, placed his hand on his sword, and said, "" Enough with your insults. You will show respect to your Priestess.""

""You admit that you are waging a crusade, and you are offended by a minor insult?"" Ryder said. ""Let me explain this to you. My people have faced your kind before. Each time we defeated them, I know where your path lies. In the ashes of history where Utopianism belongs.""

""My people, the United States has our values, Liberty being one. Everyone has the right to find their paths and pursue them according to their wishes. No one has the right to force their religion, spiritual or political, upon someone and force them at gunpoint to do what they wish.""

""Liberty?"" Itaba laughed almost uncontrollably. ""Freedom is a tool for fools to act like mindless children. But all must grow up to be responsible.""

""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings, Itaba,"" Ryder said. ""We will not allow you to take that right away from the people of Alagore. We are Americans; we are warriors, pioneers, innovators. We will not allow a Utopianist to enslave another world.""

Itaba only smiled, staring at the Comanche Captain as if looking at a child. She then said, ""You believe you are safe behind the Bridge. The Domain has grown this far, and it will come to you. And you will cast your freedoms and liberties aside in seeking forgiveness, but it will be too late.""

She then waved to the Orc. Egharod pulled out his sword and prepared to strike Ryder down.

While watching the Orc raise his sword, Ryder understood that one swing would kill him, and he was not wearing a battlesuit.

That was when Ryder noticed a red dot on the Orc shoulder. Before the blade came down, the Orc was shot with the bullet, penetrating the armor, and the resulting impact knocked him onto his rear. The Dark Elf's confidence look quickly was replaced with fear, and she stepped backward.

Noticing the gravity well from the transport airship above him, the Captain saw two individuals with large shields descending. Seeing his one opportunity to escape, he turned around and ran as fast as possible.

Shrouds and energy bolts impacted around him as a firefight between his people and the Unity. The Akilla that hovered further back opened and fired toward the Captain. A greenish-yellow glow launched from a pod and flew like a missile. It zig-zagged through the air, which confused him, seeing that it was guided. However, it was not efficient for some reason.

Seeing that the missile was coming, Ryder jumped for cover as the missile impacted the ground. He flew through the air a short distance, then impacted the ground, rolling multiple times until he rammed into a pair of small boulders.

Feeling pain throughout his body, Ryder slowly stood up. He saw the two shieldmen assisting their Orc leader and the Priestess. The four hovered up the gravity lift into the Orgat before flying away.

The infantry on the ground started rushing forward, hoping to capture him while the Captain was separated from his people. Not wanting to be retaken prisoner, he pulled out his sidearm and fired a few shots before getting back up and heading back to his people. However, he was stopped by enemy weapons fire and forced to take cover by the boulder.

Five enemy hostiles charged toward him, carrying staff weapons.

The front two were suddenly killed, forcing the others to stop and seek cover.

Surprised by what happened, Ryder looked back and saw some of Comanche coming for him. Ford was up front, holding a scutum as protection. Behind him were the Twins, using the scutum as cover while they engaged the enemy hostiles. Among them was Barrett, who provided direction.

When they arrived, Ford took the covering position, facing the enemy. A shroud and two enemy bolts impacted the scutum, glowing slightly from the enchanted crystal at the center of the large shield. The Twins were on each side of the shield, firing into the enemy.

Sergeant First Class Gregory Barrett helped the Captain back onto his feet. ""Let's hope this doesn't become a thing, Boss.""

""Enjoy the job security,"" Ryder said. ""Let's get out of here.""

The Captain and Sergeant First Class got behind Ford scutum, and the five slowly headed backward. Ryder saw another one of those glowing missiles from the Akilla impact one of the empty AMTVs, causing it to explode.

As the Akilla hovered forward for an attack run, Ryder noticed a missile fired from a nearby ridgeline, impacting the attack airship from behind. The enemy aircraft exploded in bright flames as it fell to the ground, breaking the enemy formation to avoid the debris.

This gave the Comanche soldiers the break they needed, and they all ran back toward their lines. As they drew closer, two AMTVs busted from the forest, their heavy machine guns and grenade launchers firing against the Unity.

""It's Ghost,"" Barrett said.

""About time,"" Ford added.

The two Ghost armored vehicles took position by the forest edge, maintaining their fire against the shocked Unity infantry, which left them in disarray from the sudden ambush and loss of air support. A few enemy worriers could return fire, but it was fruitful because they were trapped in the open.¬†

This did not stop The Unity from attempting to stop Ryder and his rescuers from escaping. As they fell back to the mountain's base, they opened fire on their position. Being in the opening forced them to huddle close behind Ford's scutum as it absorbed energy blasts and shrouds.¬†

With the enemy distracted from Ghost from the left and Comanche and Redcoat from the base of the mountain, Barrett held Ryder up with his arm over his as they made their return. The Captain noticed Ford's scutum shake from a loud noise as an energy blast impacted the shield.¬†

""I don't think it will take much more,"" Ford said.¬†

""Long enough,"" Ryder said.

When they returned to the two teams, Ryder saw that Rommel King had already loaded the remaining POVs into the metal wagons and UGV transports, which they started heading toward Ghost's position. To the Captain's surprise, he saw Natilite holding an M77 designated marksman rifle, firing against the enemy to provide cover.¬†

King noticed his comrades returning and approached. ""Welcome back to the living, sir. Everyone evacuating. We are ready to go.""

""Then don't let me hold us up,"" Ryder said. ""Comanche. Load up and roll out!""

Harry Is Cracking under Pressure: How the Sussex‚Äôs Failures Are Making It Necessary to Settle,SaintMeghanMarkle,1i6vxc4,2025-01-21 17:55:29,445,1.0,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1i6vxc4/harry_is_cracking_under_pressure_how_the_sussexs/,Cultural_Ad4935,Shitpost/Markle Snarkle,"A slayer of dragons he is not. Meghan is calling the shots as always. She wants the Murdoch settlement money to fund the lifestyle she is accustomed to ever since she tricked Harry into marrying her. They are also down a huge financial hole due to their long string of business failures.

Harry‚Äôs plan was to go nuclear with the British press and was not going to back down. He was not interested in a deal even though he had no shred of evidence to support his flimsy claims. But that didn‚Äôt stop the deluded fool. In his head, he wanted to go down in history as the righteous one who took on big media and won. It could be the subject of another book!

But that was until the first three weeks of January happened. Some might call it the winter of their discontent. Meghan and Harry missed the mark in 2025. She got back on instagram with cringey videos and launched her awful Netflix trailer. They went into a fire ravaged community to capitalize on people‚Äôs grief. And then she got exposed, again, as the toxic bully that she is by Vanity Fair.

But instead of going into his trial confident and principled, he is running scared. Because he doesn‚Äôt have a case and will be on the hook for court costs and lawyers fees. Meghan is likely livid that he continues with these childish cases that will go nowhere. It‚Äôs just like his polo hobby. She despises his interests because they are boring and money draining.

Nope, we are settling, she says. Stop the case. We got bills to pay. Tomorrow will bring a new chapter to their lives. When they are going to stop suing the media. This has been the worst year for them, and they simply could not afford to lose a million pounds. Even with the settlement, their rate of spending is so high that it likely won‚Äôt last long. Especially as they probably have to pay crisis PR experts to shovel them out of the rubble."
Midnight at the mountains of Mourne,deepnightsociety,1i6vuh0,2025-01-21 17:51:55,8,0.91,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i6vuh0/midnight_at_the_mountains_of_mourne/,Swagemandbagem,,"I remember the first time I saw the Mountains of Mourne in the mist. It was a Friday, just after the rain had passed, and the clouds were still clinging to the peaks like a shroud over a corpse. I was young then, just fifteen, but already too familiar with the violent world of Northern Ireland ‚Äî a world that made your skin crawl and your heart beat like a drum at night. The Troubles were in full swing, and the air was thick with fear, suspicion, and the crackle of gunfire.

It was my uncle Dan who first took me to the mountains. He was a quiet man, the kind whose silence made you nervous, as if he were hiding something just out of reach. He was a big man, broad-shouldered with hands that looked like they could break a neck in a second. I'd always known that Dan was involved in things ‚Äî things my mother warned me to stay away from, even if she didn't say it outright.

""We‚Äôre going to the Mournes tomorrow at dusk,"" he'd said, his voice low and grave, like a whisper from the grave itself. ""Some business that needs attending to.""

I didn‚Äôt ask questions. No one did, not with the way things were at the time. My cousins had been involved with the IRA for years, but Dan, though he wasn't as vocal about it, was tied to the underground in ways most people couldn't imagine. I just knew that if he said ""business,"" you did it ‚Äî no matter what. His calls were cryptic, but they were never ignored.

We drove out of Belfast in the early evening, the sky darkening like the bruises on a child‚Äôs skin. As we got closer to the mountains, the landscape began to twist and change. The rolling hills gave way to jagged rocks and cliffs that seemed to claw at the sky. It was like a place out of time, untouched by anything human.

We parked the car by a small stone wall, the engine‚Äôs dying hum mixing with the faint sounds of birds calling from the trees. Dan didn‚Äôt say a word as we climbed over the wall and made our way up the rough path that led into the hills.

The air was colder now, and I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rise. We passed the ruins of old stone cottages, their windows shattered, their roofs caved in. Remnants of a time long gone, but not a time before the British had come, I knew. Every step seemed to echo in the emptiness, like the mountains themselves were watching us.

Eventually after a long, wordless hike, we went off the course up to the peak, instead veering into the woods in a slightly flatter area. A few minutes later we reached a small clearing, a patch of land where the grass grew tall and wild. There were trees in every direction, but where we stood we could see clearly up to the night sky. In the centre of the clearing there were a bunch of large rocks of about the same size, some toppled over in a vague circle. But the way the ground devoted in some spots and shaped around the rocks told me that at some point in time, they must‚Äôve been placed more uniformly. Dan stopped, his eyes scanning the murky woods. He pulled something from his jacket ‚Äî a package wrapped in brown paper ‚Äî and laid it carefully on the ground.

""Wait here,"" he muttered.

I didn‚Äôt argue. I knew better than to ask questions. But something about the place set my nerves on edge. It was as if the land itself was alive, and it didn't want us there. The wind whispered through the trees, and I could hear the faint crackling of static in the air, as if the mountains themselves were speaking in a language I couldn‚Äôt understand.

I turned my back for just a moment, trying to steady my breath, and that‚Äôs when I heard it. A voice. Low and guttural, like a growl or a murmur, coming from somewhere deep in the woods.

""Dan‚Ä¶"" I breathed, but my voice was swallowed by the wind. My eyes scanned the trees, but I saw nothing.

My heart raced. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd heard it at all or if the stress of the situation had finally gotten to me. But I knew something was wrong. The air felt thick, oppressive, like it was pressing down on my chest. I could hear the wind pick up, swirling around us in a frenzy.

And then, I saw it.

It was a figure, that much I could make out. It was standing out in the trees, half hidden in the shadows.

I froze. My breath caught in my throat.

""Dan."" I said again, but the words came out strangled, as if something had lodged in my chest. My uncle was still standing by the package, his back turned to me, unaware.

The figure in the trees moved closer. It moved in an unnatural way. You know how in older video games, characters don‚Äôt exactly walk, they sort of just slide glide forward while displaying a walking animation? It was like that. I wanted to run, but my legs felt like they were made of stone, unable to move, as if the mountains themselves had taken root in my bones.

And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure was gone. No footsteps, no rustling of leaves. Like it had melted back into the earth.

""Come on, lad,"" Dan called, his voice flat. ""Job‚Äôs done.""

I blinked, my heart still pounding, and when I looked up again, the clearing was empty. The figure was gone, as if it had never been there. My mind was spinning, but I forced myself to walk over to my uncle. He gave me a sharp look, but I said nothing. There were a lot of things you just didn‚Äôt talk about in Northern Ireland back then.

Later, when we were driving back down the mountain road, I asked him, almost against my will, ""Who was that man? Was he one of ours?""

Dan didn‚Äôt answer at first. He just kept his eyes on the road, the headlights cutting through the mist like two white knives. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he spoke.

""Not everything that roams these lands are our of society, of our factions, lad. Some things never left. And some things... they come back. Forget about tonight. What happened tonight stays here, up in the Mournes.""

I didn‚Äôt ask any more questions after that.

But I‚Äôve never forgotten the look in his eyes that night. The terror behind them. Not then, not now, and not five years later, when I returned to that place.

I joined the IRA in 1973, as soon as I turned eighteen. The Troubles were in full bloom, each day a new round of bloodshed and madness. In the streets of Belfast, you couldn‚Äôt go a day without hearing the crack of gunfire or the screech of tires as another bomb went off. You could feel it in the air, a tension so thick it seemed to press down on your chest, making it hard to breathe. People looked at each other like they were waiting for a reason to pull a trigger. It was the kind of place that could make even the toughest man turn soft, or worse, make him tough in ways you didn‚Äôt want to know. And for a long time, I knew I wanted to fight for our cause.

Back then, I would have died for a united Ireland. Without hesitation. But that changed, when I returned to the Mountains of Mourne.

It was the winter of ‚Äô76, the year everything started to spiral out of control. The British had made it clear that they weren‚Äôt backing down, and neither were we. The war had become a game of attrition‚Äîtit-for-tat ambushes, bombings, checkpoints, and killings. The usual. I was a lieutenant in the Belfast unit at the time, just a kid by the standards of the older men, but I had a reputation. You didn‚Äôt make it as far as I did without learning how to kill with precision, how to move in silence, how to erase every trace of your presence in the world. But that wasn‚Äôt what mattered to the ones who called the shots. What mattered was my loyalty. And when they said jump, I jumped.

""Tommy,"" said Callaghan, one of the senior men in the barracks, his eyes burning with some fever I couldn‚Äôt place. He was a hard bastard, the kind who didn't flinch at much. His face was a craggy map of scars, the kind of man you wanted on your side if things went south. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going up to the Mournes tomorrow night. There‚Äôs a job for you, a special one. Just you.‚Äù

I remember the weight of his words, the way he said it‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt a question, but a command. There wasn‚Äôt a shred of doubt in his voice. I nodded, not wanting to ask too many questions.

I remember thinking it was odd, being sent alone. I‚Äôd always been part of a team‚Äîguys you could rely on when the shots rang out. But not this time. Callaghan didn‚Äôt give me much more than that‚Äîjust a nod, a brief handshake, and a look that told me not to ask questions. I didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how things worked. You didn‚Äôt ask, you just did. And yes, of course I‚Äôd always harboured a weird feeling towards the mountains of Mourne. Even though I had stowed away the memories of my visit to the place with my uncle five years ago in some corner of my brain, the idea of returning to the place filled me with dread.

I didn‚Äôt like it, but that didn‚Äôt matter. I had orders.

About a month passed, and the date of the mission rolled around. I packed light‚Äîa pistol, a spare mag, a grenade, and a map of the area. Sure, I knew what the objective was: Go to the location on the mountain chosen by the information broker and collect the document; but in truth I had no idea what I was really walking into. None of us ever really did. But Callaghan was always able to remind us that it wasn‚Äôt just one mission, one robbery, one shootout ‚Äì it was a war, no matter what label the Brits put on it. And when a man like that tells you to do something, you just do it.

I grabbed my pack and made the long drive down the narrow roads toward the mountains, the sky bruised purple with the coming night. As I came to the outskirts of Belfast the night grew wet and cold. The rain beat down on the windshield like it was angry, like the weather itself was trying to stop me. But I didn‚Äôt care. I was used to it.

¬†As the city faded behind me, the air grew heavier. That was around the time the weight of things settled in my chest. Back to that place, back to the mountains of fucking Morne. I drove through Newry, but it wasn‚Äôt long before the familiar roads fell away, and the land opened up in front of me‚Äîa cold, dark expanse of rocky terrain, blanketed in mist. The Mournes, rising high and impossible, looming over me, an old nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake from.

When I arrived at the foot of Slieve Donard, the highest peak, I left the car parked by the side of the road and started on foot. The night had already swallowed the daylight, and the mountains seemed to hold their breath as I walked. The air grew colder with each step, and the silence pressed against me like a physical thing. There was no wind, no sound of animals, no rustling of the trees. It was as though the mountain itself was waiting. Watching.

As I climbed the trail, the mist grew thicker, curling around me like a living thing, a slow-moving fog that swallowed everything in its path. The crunch of my boots against the stones was the only sound for miles. The mountains stretched ahead of me, vast and cold, their peaks shrouded in the darkness of night. Every step felt heavier, like the land itself was pulling me down.

I didn‚Äôt know why I was here. Why this was the location chosen by an information broker. I‚Äôd asked Callaghan once, a few weeks back, when the orders first came through. But he just gave me that look‚Äîthe one that told me to keep my mouth shut.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand when you get there,‚Äù he said, and that was all.

I knew the terrain well enough. I‚Äôd done plenty of jobs in the various hills around Belfast, plenty of walking through fog and shadow. And I‚Äôd never forgotten that night with Dan years ago. It scared me, I feel no shame in admitting it. But orders were orders. This felt different to any mission before, though. There was something about the air, something about the way the landscape seemed to close in on me, that made me feel like prey.

I reached the spot the map marked for my destination by the time the moon was full overhead, casting long, thin shadows across the ground. An open area, close to the very peak of the mountain. I paused for a moment, my senses on edge, but I forced myself to walk towards the centre. My orders were clear: meet the contact, get the information, and return. That was it. No questions. Quiet, no fuss.

The fog was so dense up here that I genuinely couldn‚Äôt know for certain if the person I was sent to meet was there or not. But as I hesitantly made my way forward, something changed. The air thickened, the temperature dropping even further, until I could see my breath hanging in the air like smoke. I didn‚Äôt understand it. The cold wasn‚Äôt normal. It wasn‚Äôt just winter cold. It was a deep, unnatural cold that seemed to come from the very ground beneath my feet and encompassed me up to the tip of my scalp.

And then I heard it.

A voice. Low, guttural, and ancient.

‚ÄúTommy McGrath‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt a human voice. It was‚Ä¶ older. It came from the earth itself, from the stones. It was as though the mountain was speaking directly to me. My heart raced, my hand instinctively reaching for the pistol at my side.

‚ÄúTommy‚Ä¶‚Äù The voice repeated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chosen.‚Äù

The words echoed in my head, vibrating through my bones.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I whispered, not meaning to speak aloud, but unable to stop myself.

The mist swirled around me, thickening, until I could barely see the hand in front of my face. A figure emerged from the fog‚Äîa man, tall and thin, dressed in black. His face was hidden in shadow, but I knew it was him. Callaghan. It had to be.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come,‚Äù Callaghan‚Äôs voice came from the figure, but it wasn‚Äôt quite his voice. It was deeper, older. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time.‚Äù

‚ÄúTime for what?‚Äù I demanded, stepping back, my grip tightening on the gun. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äôs going on here, Callaghan?‚Äù

He stepped closer, his eyes gleaming like coal in the dim light. And then he smiled. But it wasn‚Äôt the kind of smile I‚Äôd ever seen on him before. It was the smile of someone who knew something you didn‚Äôt‚Äîsomething you could never know. A smile that was as old as the hills themselves.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chosen, Tommy,‚Äù he said again, this time with a slow, deliberate drawl. ‚ÄúFor the final stage of the war. The war you don‚Äôt understand yet.‚Äù

I stared at him, not sure if he was speaking in riddles or if I was just losing my mind in the mountains.

‚ÄúListen, I don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about, but this isn‚Äôt funny. Where‚Äôs the contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no contact,‚Äù Callaghan said, his voice suddenly cold. ‚ÄúThere never was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat in God‚Äôs name are you playing at?‚Äù

But Callaghan didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, the fog around us thickened again, and the ground beneath my feet trembled. The stones of the circle began to glow faintly, a sickly green light pulsing from within them. I took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but the fear in my chest held me in place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been part of this all along, Tommy,‚Äù Callaghan continued, his eyes burning with an intensity that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. ‚ÄúYou were chosen before you even knew what was happening. The mountains have chosen you. The war was never just about politics, or even blood. It‚Äôs about something much older.‚Äù

I shook my head, trying to process his words, but they didn‚Äôt make sense. The Troubles wasn‚Äôt a war for gods or for land. This was a war for the Irish people, a war for survival.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeding it,‚Äù Callaghan said, as though reading my thoughts. ‚ÄúThe blood. The violence. The hatred. The Mournes have fed on it for centuries. You, and all the others like you, are just the latest offering.‚Äù ¬†The stone circle began to tremble, and the figures in the fog moved closer.

Callaghan stepped forward, and I realized with a sickening certainty that he wasn‚Äôt one of us. He was one of them. A servant of whatever dark force had been awakened in the Mournes. A force that fed on blood, on war, on the sacrifices we made without even knowing it.

He grinned again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeding it, Tommy. And now it‚Äôs time for you to give it what it wants.‚Äù

With that, the fog closed in further. I reached for my gun, ready to blow a whole through Callaghan, but he‚Äôd already sank back into the fog. And I never saw him again, not after all these years.

I stumbled after him, but lost my way, running blindly, and eventually I realised that I was lying to myself if I believed I was chasing him. I was really running away in fear. I used to think the scariest thing in the world was the guy in the streets of Belfast who would shoot you without a thought. But I was wrong. I hadn‚Äôt felt fear like this before in my life.

I kept running, running, running downhill and found my way into a wooded area. It wasn‚Äôt long before I came upon a clearing‚Äîa wide space where there were no trees. And then to my absolute horror, I realised where I really was. There, in the middle, was the old stone circle. Where Dan took me all those years ago. I stood there for a moment, staring at the stones in total helplessness. In the dim light of the moon, I realised that the stones were different to how I remembered them. I could see faint markings on them‚Äîsymbols I couldn‚Äôt understand and words in old Gaelic I couldn‚Äôt translate; under British occupation we were never taught our country‚Äôs own language. They were the kind of things you might expect to find on a tombstone or a forgotten altar. It was as if someone had carved them into the rocks long ago, as if the earth itself had grown old with them, even though I knew they‚Äôd been placed sometime in the last five years

Then I heard it.

A voice. Low, rumbling, like a growl from deep beneath the earth.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come.‚Äù

I froze. The voice didn‚Äôt sound like a man, or even a human at all. It was as if the mountain itself had spoken, the words carried on the wind, vibrating in my chest. My breath caught, and I gripped the gun at my side.

But then, through the fog, I saw movement. Figures, tall and gaunt, slipping in and out of the mist. They weren‚Äôt quite people‚Äîmore like shadows, their bodies flickering like candle flames caught in a gust of wind. They moved without sound, without footsteps, their faces obscured by the fog.

My heart hammered in my chest.

‚ÄúLeave now, or you‚Äôll never leave.‚Äù

I spun around. There, just outside the stone circle, staring straight at me from just a metre or two away was a man‚Äîor at least, what looked like one. His clothes were tattered, like he‚Äôd been out here for years, and his face was impossibly pale, almost milk white, as though he hadn‚Äôt seen the sun in decades. His eyes were dark, not the kind of dark you‚Äôd expect, but great black orbs in his sockets with no visible iris, pupils or white parts. Even hunched over, he towered over me, his arms hanging down to almost his shins.

And his voice. His voice was the same as the growl. It came from somewhere deep inside him, like it was being pulled out by something far older than him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve trespassed on sacred ground, soldier,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here. You were never meant to find us.‚Äù

And then I understood.

The man wasn‚Äôt human. No, not exactly. He was something far older, something tied to the land, to the mountains themselves. He wasn‚Äôt here by choice. He was a part of the Mournes. A part of the ancient earth that had seen too much bloodshed, too many sacrifices, too much history soaked into the soil.

And I‚Äî*I*‚Äîhad just walked into the middle of it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see?‚Äù he said, low and rasping as he drew closer to me. ‚ÄúThis land has known war long before the likes of your armies ever set foot on it. It‚Äôs soaked in the blood of those who died here, in battles you‚Äôll never understand. And now you‚Äôre part of it.‚Äù

I stumbled back, the weight of his words sinking in. The mountains, the stones, the fog‚Äîeverything around me seemed alive now, as though the earth itself was watching me, judging me. The men I had killed, the bombs I had planted, the lives I had taken‚Äîsuddenly it all felt like a grain of sand in an ocean of blood, meaningless against the weight of something far darker.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never leave, Tommy,‚Äù the being whispered again, and for the first time, I felt it‚Äî*the pull*. It wasn‚Äôt just in my head; it was physical, like the earth itself was reaching for me, drawing me into the stones, into the silence of the mountains.

For a moment, I stood there, my mind spinning, my body frozen. And then the truth hit me like a slap to the face. This wasn‚Äôt about a simple message. It wasn‚Äôt about the IRA, or the war, or Callaghan or some mission. It was about something far older, far darker than anything I‚Äôd ever known.

The Mournes weren‚Äôt just mountains. They were a place of power, a place of blood, a place where the past never died.

And I had trespassed. I had disturbed the land.

The fog began to swirl, faster now, the whispers louder, more insistent. I could feel the cold grip of the mountain on my chest, and I knew‚ÄîI knew‚ÄîI would never leave this place. Not really.

More and more figures flickered in and out of my peripheral in the fog as the impossible being I was facing took a final step forward and looked at me, his almost mummified, haunting face twisted into an expression of what seemed to be pity.

‚ÄúYou were never meant to leave,‚Äù he rasped, quieter now despite him being right in front of me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be lost for as long as you live, tied to this place. You and I and those who here already and those to come.‚Äù I blinked, and suddenly the fog was completely gone, the wraith-like things swirling in it disappeared with it. But not whoever I was speaking to. Before my eyes he remained.

‚ÄúPlease leave now, soldier, you may be lucky enough to not lose yourself.‚Äù

And with that, he turned around, and slowly walked away unnaturally, back into the trees

As I turned and ran, my feet stumbling over the uneven ground, I felt the darkness closing in around my mind. The mountain‚Äôs voice echoed in my ears, a low, suffocating hum.

*You were never meant to leave.*

And when I finally looked back, all I saw was the fog, and the cold, empty stones of the Mourne Mountains.

And I knew, then, that I was lost. Forever. I‚Äôve lived a long life, left the IRA, started a family and made the best of the world despite the things I‚Äôd done as a soldier. But through all of it, the call of the mountains has never left me, never given my mind true peace. The mountains of Mourne want me to come back, and I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll be able to resist their pull. My wife‚Äôs been dead just over a year now. My son never came back from America for longer than a week at a time once he finished college and moved there to pursue some dream or the other.

I‚Äôm just an old man with declining health living alone in the same old Belfast street, and the Mournes haunt me more than ever before. I fear the day I‚Äôll give in and give myself to the mountains, let them take me fully, but I often wonder if maybe they already have.

The war was never meant to end ‚Äì it was meant to feed the darkness, forever."
"Book report guy, with a detailed post on the history of the Hart Family after reading a half dozen books that were written by or about them. This one is kinda depressing tbh, but I have a morbid fascination with this fucked up family.",JimCornette,1i6uk4i,2025-01-21 16:57:56,98,0.95,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimCornette/comments/1i6uk4i/book_report_guy_with_a_detailed_post_on_the/,OShaunesssy,üìëBook Addicted Report Poster (Book Report Guy)üìñüìù,"Having read a book that detailed the history of Stampede Wrestling, as well as a book that detailed Stu Hart's life, and the books written by Bret Hart, Bruce Hart, Diana Hart, Julie Hart and Dynamite Kid, I have compiled a wild family history.

This won't feature anything really on Stampede Wrestling promotion and instead be a deep dive into the family history of the various siblings. You won't see too much on Bret here tbh as that would end up dominating the whole post and believe it or not, I still had to cut a bunch of details out.

As always it's in chronological order, to the best of my ability, and I hope y'all enjoy! 

Stu Hart's father Edward was late on arrival to a plot of land he was looking to purchase in Alberta, Canada in the mid 1920's, so the owner sold it to someone else. Edward contested this and actually settled on the land, setting himself and family up in tents, and living off the land while Edward traveled into the city everyday to deal with the legal logistics and contesting ownership with the the man who rightfully bought the land. Stu, his sisters, mother and father spent 4 years living in tents in central Alberta even through the freezing cold winters.

Eventually the RCMP (highway police in canada) got fed up with Edward and arrested him, sending Stu and his family to social services in Edmonton. But not before burning literally everything on the property, the houses Edward built and all of their belongings. Stu would reflect on this bitterly for the rest of his life. A few weeks later Edward was released and the family were back together.

While serving as an athletic coach for various military competitions during WWII, Stu would meet Joseph ""Tootz"" Mondt, a New York based wrestling promoter who told him to come work for him after he finishes up with the army. 

It would be in New York, while working for ""Toots"" Mondt, where Stu would meet his future wife Helen. He would eventually convince her to marry him, despite her family's reservations against pro wrestling. Apparently, Helen's mother never forgave Stu for taking her daughter away from New York and into the harsh winters of Montana and Alberta.


Their eldest son, Smith Hart, born in 1948, and by all accounts is a world class screw up, who Stu didn't respect much as an adult. 

While pregnant with their next child, Stu and Helen were in a bad car accident that where Helen told she would most likely lose the baby. Their 2nd child Bruce would be born in 1950, and this is possibly why Bruce had such a special connection with his mom that the other children didn't receive. Helen would give Bruce whatever he wanted and growing up in the position he was in, Bruce wanted to take over the family buisness, despite often butting heads with Stu over creative direction and the level of violence in matches. 

Due to the recovery period and new baby, their first born Smith was sent to live with his grandparents in New York, where Smith would be spoiled and given a skewed upbringing compared to his siblings. 

No one is confident about where the ""Hart Dungeon"" got its name, outside of the fact that it was an apt description of the basement. The floor lined with thin wrestling mats, that were blue when first installed, had since faded a dark yellow color from the sweat, blood, tears and even vomit over the years. Helen 

Helen was recovering in the Hospital from a that car accident when Stu bought the house and she fucking hated it when she finally saw it. 

Their 3rd child, Keith Hart was born next in 1952, and is often looked at as the more mature older siblings. 

After spending 2 years in New York, where Smith was allegedly spoiled and given anything he wanted, he was finally sent back home to Calgary in 1952. By the time he returned home to the Hart Mansion though, Keith Hart says Smith had turned into a ""spoiled little monster, who, I think, had a deep-rooted hatred for my dad, who had taken him away from this place where he could do anything he wanted.""

Their 4th child, Wayne Hart would be born the following year in '53, and would serve as a full-time Stampede Wrestling referee. Wayne never got involved in the drama and no one has anything bad to say about him. Except for Stu, who hated his long hair. Honestly, I always throw respect towards Wayne, who always managed to stay out of the drama with no issues amongst his siblings. Diana Hart shaded everyone in her book, even Ross, but she had nothing bad to say about Wayne.

Their 5th child, Dean Hart would be born next, in 1954, but would have little to do with the wrestling buisness. Most siblings like Diana, Bret and Bruce classify Dean as a smooth talking con-man of sorts.

Their 6th child, and first girl, Elizabeth ""Ellie"" Hart would be born in 1955, and years later, marry Jim Neidhart. Ellie is one that by all accounts, would deal with the most spousal abuse

Their 7th child, and second girl, Georgia Hart would be born in 1956. Georgia always comes off well in these stories about the Hart Family. She seemed very sweet to all her siblings.

Their 8th, and most famous child, Bret Hart, would be born in 1957. The most famous but possibly least liked by all his siblings.

Their 9th child and third girl, Allison Hart, would be born in 1959. Allison never seemed to like wrestling that much, and would grow to hate Vince McMahon with a passion. I'd say next to Bret, she at one point had the most rage built up, saying she hated Vince as much as she loved her dad.

Their 10th child, Ross Hart, would be born in 1960, who would go onto help with wrestling tv production and training at Stampede Wrestling. By all accounts, Ross sounds like the most intelligent of all the Hart children.

Their 11th child and youngest daughter, Diana Hart, would be born in 1963 and go on to marry ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith. Diana is arguably the most controversial of the siblings.

Their final child, Owen would be born I'm 1965, and become one of the most beloved wrestlers of all time before tragically dying young in 1999.

Allison Hart also remembers how chaotic the home life was at Hart Mansion, where some mornings she would walk into the kitchen to be greeted by unknown Japanese wrestlers bowing to her, or how her father set up a wrestling ring in the backyard and you could hear screams and yelps of pain all day long from the backyard. She remembers one afternoon when her father was called to a local hotel because a midget wrestler of his was drunk and doing handstands on the roof.

Allison Hart remembers how if her or a sister brought home a date, their father Stu would size him up and take him down to the dungeon where he would stretch them until they screamed. Allison says that those dates would never ask them out again. Her future husband Ben Bassarab remembers Stu as a bully who would just hurt people without explaining anything that he was doing. 

In 2001, Diana Hart would write a scandalous and legal minefield of a book called ""Under The Mat."" It was quickly pulled from shelves after Owen Hart's widow Martha threatened legal action over what was said about her and Owen. Bret and Bruce also denounce the book, calling it mostly lies, but not everything can be written off as fiction, including stories, some wild stores about Dean Hart and their mother.

One big detail that most Hart kids argued against from Diana's ""Under The Mat"" book was her saying that their mom Helen Hart turned to significant alcohol use as a way to handle all the stress of her everyday life. While all the kids vehemently deny this, Helen's own autobiographical essay she did from 1977 actually supports the claim. In it she details how Stu would drink tea but her drink of choice was gin and how she would often hide somewhere in the big house away from her family. She notes how she felt outnumbered by the kids and all the responsibilities stressed her out. Allison Hart acknowledges that her mother would drink, but says the books claim of her being a ""raging alcoholic"" were an outright lie. Like I said, a lot of what was written in that book have since turned out to be true, though not all of it.

Dean Hart was an entrepreneur who started an Auto Body Shop in downtown Calgary and even owned a landscaping company, as well as managing a few outdoor concert venues.

Diana Hart remembers Dean as being smooth with older women, he would borrow their cars and persuade them to lend him money, Ross Hart would look back on Dean as a bit of a con artist. 

In 1978, Dean would be hit by a car that would do permanent damage to his kidneys and push him towards Marijuana use as a way to cope, and potentially other drugs but thats never confirmed.

The eldest child, Smith Hart lived a care free life where at best, most saw him as a good hearted screw up. He fathered (at least) 4 children under 4 different women, and even middle named his first child ""Ecstacy."" Though his siblings suspect the real number of kids to be closer to 12. The mother of his first child lived with him at The Hart House for years until they separated. One of her common activities was to strip naked, and stand on the balcony and wave at passerby folk. According to Diana Hart, she suffered from schizophrenia and compounded it with drug abuse. She would later die of pneumonia. 

The 2nd mother to Smith's child was a teenage runaway he met in his 30's, who would also pass away young in 1999. The Hart men and their obsession with younger women is genuinely disturbing.

In Bret Hart's book, he claimed that one of the girls Smith knocked up was a girl that Bret was currently seeing in Hughes school, so add another underage girl to the list here.

Smith lived with his parents literally until they died, and never really got into wrestling outside of a few matches in the 70's. Stu wouldn't let him anywhere near the buisness side of wrestling and some of the wrestlers remember how he would call Smith ""Shed"" which was short for ""Shithead."" Ouch. Ross Hart says that Stu nearly disowned him entirely on more than one occasion.

Bret Hart says Smith was ""neutered"" by his parents and ""turned into a toothless hound who never had much of a say in anything."" Smith denied these stories, instead claiming that he worked significantly in the buisness throughout the 70's and 80's, describing himself as his dad's ""troubleshooter"" and said he was even a booker for Stampede at times. He called himself a ""match making genius"" and that ""everything I did just worked really well."" No one, not a single person has ever backed this claim up, and most scoff at it.

One year Stu sent Dynamite Kid, Keith and Bruce to Germany for a show, but Keith couldn't make it, so Smith filled his place. The idiot actually shaved a Hitler mustache onto himself and did the goose walk to the ring to get ""heat"" and as you can imagine, Stu was furious.

Owen Hart was an known as a great prankster and hilarious jokester, but he wasn't a natural troublemaker. Owen both feared and respected his father and always wanted to make him proud, excelling in amature wrestling and football throughout high school. But Owen was quoted as saying that ""I was living my dad's dream, being an armature wrestler and going for the Olympics. But I hated it. When I would come home I'd want to please my dad, but I should have said 'I don't want this.'"" 

An ex-girlfriend of Owen's remembers how he never really wanted to wrestle or cared much for it, he wanted to be a teacher. She remembers a time when Bret asked Owen when he was going to start wrestling and she had to jump in for Owen's defence and express that he wasn't going to do that. Owen's widow Martha wrote in her book that ""Bruce was salivating at the thought of getting Owen in the ring."" 

BJ Annis was a Vietnam vet and pilot who met Georgia Hart when she was 19 working at the Calgary Stampede show and the two quickly started dating. Everyone was shocked to discover that the 2 had gotten married after just 5 months and didn't tell anyone for a long while. Helen was furious and actually asked Stu to stetch the poor guy in the dungeon. BJ to this day is thankful he was never stretched by Stu, and he is the only one of Stu's son-in-laws that can say that.

When Bret Hart was 21 years old, he met his 1st wife, Julie Smadu who was 17 years old when she was working a security booth at a wrestling show in Regina, Saskatchewan, along with her 14 year old sister Michelle. After months of flirting, Julie and Bret were an item, with Julie and Michelle moving to Calgary with him. Michelle would go onto meet and marry Bret's co-worker Dynamite Kid a few years later when she was only 17 and he was 22 year old. Julie and Bret Hart would be married later that year, after Michelle and Dynamite.

Dean Hart would move to Hawaii where he became involved with the Samoan Mafia, and while it's unclear how involved he became, Dean would find himself transporting boxes of money or drugs or weapons, wether willingly or unwilling is unclear. Later, some gangsters who were facing murder charges, believed Dean was going to testify against them, so Dean fled back to Calgary in 1981, thinking he left that all behind. But according to Diana, some of those gangsters followed him back to Calgary and nearly beat him near to death one night. 

In Diana's book, she talks about how fucked up Dean was afterwords with his kidneys failing. She said he would sit in front of the oven, open it up and crank it to 500 as he ate shaved ice. His kidneys couldn't even process water so Dean couldn't eat or drink, he just chewed on shaved ice as he deteriorated further and further.

After returning Calgary, Dean would attempt to jump into the family buisness in a backstage role, but was remembered as being bitter by his brothers like Bruce, Bret and Keith who by that time had carved out a spot for themselves in the promotion and buisness. 

When Bruce wasn't wrestling, he was a substitute teacher at a junior high school and after he ran into one of his students at a wrestling show, the rest of the family would be horrified to discover Bruce at over 30 years old, was dating a teenager! This girl named Andrea would end up pregnant in early 1983, when she was 16 and Bruce was 33! Other reports claim he was 34 and she was 15 but its hard to know what is ore accurate. Ross Hart defends his brother by saying ""it wasn't a scandle"" and ""they seemed to really love each other."" Seriously, this family and it's obsession with underage girls.

Annis Hart, Georgia and BJ's son was born in 1983, and had dreams of being a pro wrestler like his grandpa Stu and famous uncles. But stay tuned, because this family isn't about happy endings.

Also, in 1983, Allison Hart would marry Ben Bassarab, with Ben promising her he wouldn't get involved in wrestling, but quickly went back on his word when Allison's family invited him to come try out at a show. 

By all accounts, Ben Bassarab doesn't sound like a good husband or partner, and Allison soon realized after marriage that she wasn't a priority for him. When she was pregnant with their first child, Allison had to have an ovarian cyst removed, and just wanted to go home after the hospital. But Ben drove her to the Hart House so he could go drinking with Jim Neidhart and the boys in the back yard while Allison sat in the kitchen, crying in pain. When Keith came in for more beer and found his sister like that, he went outside to smarten up Ben, ordering to take Allison home. An enraged Ben would then take out his anger yelling at Allison, leading to an enraged Keith jumping into the vehicle instead of Allison and he started assaulting Ben. Ben couldn't do much as Keith shoved his head under the steering wheel and peppered him with strikes, before Stu yanked Keith out of the car and escorted Ben and Allison back to their house.

Allison was terrified of Ben by this point and begged Stu to not leave them alone but he did, ordering her to figure it out. Stu made it clear to Allison that divorce wasn't an option and she absolutely, must figure it out. 

Allison felt trapped, and years later Ben doesn't have much remorse for the situation, as he described to the author of a book in 2004, while sipping a Baileys and Coffee, all while laughing at how absurd the whole thing was. Ben says he would try to leave Allison, a few years later when he realised how ridiculous the whole situation was, being on the road 6 nights a week with girlfriends in every town, pretending to be a husband and father for a few hours a week. He arrogantly talks about leaving her like he was the bigger man to do it, and frames it as an act of kindness to her.

Ben recalls the day he went to Stu and admitted his infidelities and transgressions as a husband/ father, telling Stu he was going to divorce Allison as she clearly wishes. Stu was furious and Ben remembers how he angrily said ""You think your the first guy to have a relationship on the road!"" Ben wouldn't budge though, telling Stu that WWF had expressed interest in him. Ben believes Stu killed that possibility himself by contacting someone at WWF, though that's purely speculation and sounds like a guy blowing smoke up his own ass. 

Allison tried to make it work for a long time, despite knowing about his affairs and his treatment of her. Ben denies things ever got physical but Allison alludes otherwise. One day she said she was looking at her daughters, one a toddler and the other a newborn, when she decided she didn't want them raised by that man. On that day she finally defied her father, and called her lawyer to get the separation and divorce started.

In 1984, Diana Hart would marry Davey Boy Smith, though she was initially interested in his older cousin Dynamite Kid.

Also in 1984, Helen Hart was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and that, along with multiple business related factors, pushed Stu towards finally selling the promotion, and on Aug 24, 1984, Stu Hart officially sold his territory to Vince McMahon and the WWF. Bret Hart was promised a good spot on the card for WWF as well as a few other key guys, but Bruce Hart was notably not one of them. He was actually kept in the dark to the entire sale process and was blindsided by the news when he found out by seeing it reported on TV or the radio. Bruce was offered a small job where he would arrange behind the scenes stuff for the WWF, but he hated it.

Bruce Hart would be the one to blow up the whole deal, wether he realized it or not is up for debate. When an upstart promotion in Calgary tried to start up their own Stampede Wrestling in 1985 (Stu never trademarked it!) Bruce got involved behind the scenes briefly while he was still emplyed by WWF, and this was after Stu and Vince agreed no Hart would violate the no-compete claus they put in the deal. When Vince found out, he used this as leverage to back out of the sale of the territory.

In 1986 when Stampede was reopened and needed a new face, Bruce Hart convinced Owen Hart to jump in as it's star, despite his reservations to the sport overall.

Owen Hart and Martha were married in 1989, with Bruce Hart serving as best man. A week before the event, Bruce was travelling with a bunch of Stampede guys when a bitter Dynamite Kid organized a bit of a violent mutany that would see Dynamite break Bruce's jaw. Bruce decided he wouldn't go to Owen's wedding if Dynamite was there, so Keith Hart asked Dynamite to run a wrestling show that day. Dynamite agreed but would no-show the event and spend the day drinking alone at a strip club while his wife and the entire family celebrated Owen's wedding.

In the summer of 89, a bad car accident would quicken Stempede Wrestling's collapse and further strain the Hart Family. Ross Hart was driving a van with his brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith riding passenger, as well as Chris Benoit and Karl Moffat in the back. The vehicle would lose control and smash into a station wagon on the road, and thankfully Ross was wearing his seat belt and was fine. Benoit wasn't wearing a seat belt but allegedly Ross body was able to prevent Benoit from flying through the windshield. Moffat was screaming in the back seat about a broken leg, and poor Davey was unconscious after he smashed head first into the windshield. He too wasn't wearing a seat belt it would seem. Ross Hart called Davey's wife, his sister Diana, to tell her that Davey Boy was unresponsive and it was bad. She remembers how she could hear Moffat in the background screaming ""Oh God he's dead! Davey Boy is dead!"" He wasn't dead, but he was out of action for over 5 months, he required over 130 stitches in his forehead and had herniated two disc's in his spine.

Davey Boy struggled to work and make money in the years after Stampede closed down and following his bad car accident. According to Diana, he once borrowed money from a dangerous drug dealer named Hermesh Erach Austin, and in exchange, Davey Boy let him store stolen vehicles on his property. 

Remember Allison's piece of shit ex-husband Ben Bassarab, well he actually was close with this drug dealer as well, and maybe was the one who got Davey Boy in touch with him. Ben and this drug dealer would end up serving a year long prison sentence after they beat a man near to death for flushing $30,000 worth of cocain down a toilet. 

Side note: Hermesh Erach Austin would later be convicted to life in prison after he tortured and murdered some poor fellow, incorrectly believing he stole $10,000 from him. Austin crushed the man's hands in a vice, cut his ears off with scissors and burned the soles of his feet with a blow torch, all while this poor man begged and pleaded for his life. Austin then drove him a few miles out of Calgary where he slit his throat and shot him in the head before burrying him. A few years later one of his accomplices would flip on him and tell the police everything, leading to his arrest and sentencing. These are the types of people members of The Hart Family associate with. Diana Hart said in her book that her mother Helen let some random guy live at the Hart House for nearly a year, and the guy had a collection of child porn. Seriously.

Back to Dean Hart, the one nearly beaten to death and suffering from damaged kidneys. He was legitimately dying and needed a transplant. Diana talks about something in her book that I have always had an issue with, Dean just needed a basic kidney transplant and had 13 viable doners right there who all just watched him die. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't following doctors advice so there is a chance the donation would have been wasted, but it's still shocking that no one stepped up. Bret talked about this in his book, and spoke in shame about how he didn't want to derail his career before it got going in the late 80s when Dean needed the transplant. 

Diana says no one talked about a potential transplant too much and no doctors ever really pushed them to do it. They didn't know how fast Dean was dying and didn't realize the timetable he had. Diana spoke earlier in her book about how Stu hated being sick and trained his kids to think they were immune to illness. No one took Dean's kidney failure as seriously as they should have because they all thought the Hart's were indestructible at the time. How times change.

The last time Diana saw Dean, she asked him, ""how are you doing?"" To which Dean replied, ""Barely functioning."" They had a laugh and Diana didn't think much of it 

Two days later, Diana says Allison's daughter Brooke found Dean dead, naked and laying on the bathroom floor. 

In the summer of 1993, Davey Boy and Diana Hart were out dancing when a young man made lewd comments towards her, leading to an altercation between the two men. Eye witness accounts claim that Davey Boy just picked the kid up and spiked him down on his head, but Davey Boy claims he put him in a headlock and when he let go, the kid fell and cracked his head on the ground. Either way, the young man had brain damage and significant memory loss, and Davey was being sued. Ultimately the judge ruled in his favor, but according to Diana the whole ordeal strained their marriage and cost the Hart Family over $300,000 in legal fees.

By the mid 90s, Ellie Hart's life with Jim Neidhart turned into a nightmare. After returning to Calgary in 1995, Jim was long past his most succesful time as a pro wrestler and the two fell on hard financial times forcing them to move into a home that Stu bought for them. 

In a series of sworn affidavits, Ellie alleges that Neidhart was a chronic alcoholic and drug abuser. She also claims she suffered years of physical abuse, though that was never proven in a court of law. While Stu was very, very against the idea of divorce, as he would demonstrate with his daughters failed marriages, he did support Ellie leaving Jim. In a letter Stu wrote to Jim, he told him to find a new living situation, with Stu pointing out that Ellie is fearful for her safety when Jim is around.

Diana claimed in her book that Neidhart told Davey Boy how to drug and r@pe Diana, because that's what she said Neidhart was doing to Ellie. It's really fucked up how casual Ellie was when confirming to Diana that they were both being drugged and r@ped by their husbands.

The next big loss to the Hart Family would come in 1996. Remember Georgia and BJ's son Annis, who i mentioned earlier, wanted to be a pro wrestler when he grew up. Well unfortunately this kid suffered a minor injury when he was 13 that left him unable to walk for a bit, and while at the hospital, they discovered he had a bad flesh eating disease. Nattie Hart, the daughter of Ellie and Jim Neidhart, remembers ""one day he was fine, but 12 days later he had 30 pounds of puss coving his body, his blood was rising to the surface and his skin was like burnt wood."" The family rallied around his bed in the hospital and Owen Hart promised him the keys to his mustang when Annis recovered. Unfortunately Annis would pass away 2 weeks later on July 14th, 1996, joining his uncle Dean as one of the Hart's taken far too soon.

Davey Boy's health and addiction issues only got worse through the 90s, until he would struggle to feed himself. Diana bought a water gun and would spray him every time he dropped a fork, and her sisters would chastise her for her treatment of Davey Boy. But she would fire back with ""am I the only one who noticed that he can't feed himself!?""

Things reached a boiling point for the couple in 1998, when a groggy Davey Boy couldn't even stand, so a frustrated Diana decided to take her own life, screaming at him that he did this. A useless Davey Boy could only look on and slur the words ""don't do it"" as she swallowed an entire bottle of Xanax. She immediately regretted her decision and was able to call 911 before passing out and waking up a day later at the hospital.

Keith Hart says the suicide attempt changed her, wether it was hitting that low of a point or an actual chemical imbalance from the Xanax, Keith says she lost her spark of confidence afterwards and was never the same.

After the Montreal Screwjob, Owen tried and failed to get out of his contract along with Neidhart and Davey Boy. Davey Boy claims he had to pay $100,000 to get out, but Neidhart wasn't under contract and just walked. Vince wouldn't let Owen go but did give him a raise from $300,000 per year to $400,000. 

Martha Hart, Owen's widow, claims he was very unhappy and felt trapped in that position. She also says he turned down a program with Goldust, because he hated the character. She also said he turned down a storyline that would have seen him and Jeff Jarrett both ""sleeping"" with their valet Debra.

Owen turned down so many ideas that he felt like he couldn't turn down one more, so when he was given the orders to wear the Blue Blazer suit and fly from the rafters, he reluctantly agreed. Owen allegedly told several guys backstage that he didn't feel comfortable with the stunt.

At 7:41pm on May 23rd, 1999, at a show in Kansas City, the lights dimmed and Owen Hart readied himself in the rafters and began to be carried out. Owen made what appeared to be an adjustment to his cape, and the three men up in the rafters to help him, all heard the click of the snap shackle being released. By the time they looked over at Owen, they all claimed he was clawing at the air as he fell to his death.

Martha not only invited Vince McMahon to the funeral, she insisted he come so he can see and face the corpse of the man he sent to die and the fatherless children he left behind.

Martha Hart, along with Stu and Helen Hart would sue Vince McMahon and 12 others, including the riggers who set up the harness and Kansas City, which owned the arena Owen died in.  Eventually, Martha would agree to settle, for $18 million, with 10 going to Martha, her kids getting 3 each and 1 million going to Stu and Helen. After all the legal fees though, Stu and Helen would recieve less than $700,000 each.

After Diana finally divorced Davey Boy in 2000, he got back at her by sleeping with Bruce's wife and Diana's friend, Andrea Hart. Remember the teenager Bruce knocked up? Yep, Bruce's young wife Andrea would cheat on him with Davey Boy, and eventually leave Bruce for Davey. 

Davey Boy would actually be arrested and charged for threatening to kill his wife Diana and sister-in-law Ellie. He even threatened to slit the throat of some guy she was trying to date at the time. Throughout the trial, Davey Boy was accompanied by Bruce's wife Andrea, the mother of his 5 children. What a trashy family.

When WWF ran a RAW episode in Calgary in 2001, Martha publicly said any Hart who attended would be disrespecting the memory of Owen Hart. Bret felt the same way and promised Martha they wouldn't be attending, but Bruce and Ellie came to the Hart House early and picked up Stu before Bret could stop him. Helen opted to wait for Bret, who convinced her not to go once he finally got there. At the show, Stu looking gaunt and sickly from pneumonia and heart problems, had to be helped to his feet by Bruce, as Diana, Smith, Ellie and many grandkids all stood up and waved too. Smith gave a sly smile and held up a sign that said ""Hi, Bret."" 

A few weeks after September 11th, 2001, Helen Hart was flying back home and was held up for hours in the heightened security following the terrorist attacks. During the commotion, the long-suffering diabetics blood sugar levels went awry, and when she got home that night she immediately went to sleep. The next morning Stu couldn't wake her and an ambulance was called.

A week later, with Stu never leaving her side, she woke up and Stu was able to read her poetry and everyone began to hope for the best.

Unfortunately she never left that hospital, and on Nov 4th, a few weeks later it was clear she was nearing the end. So Stu sat down next to her and said ""if you could smile for me one more time, it would mean everything to me."" Helen laid her eyes on the love of her life and smiled at him, granting him this one last wish. A teary eyed Stu Hart would kiss her on the forehead and say his goodbyes.

Alison remembers gathering for supper on the Sunday after Helen died, and being in shock when Stu sat down and just started bawling his eyes out, he couldn't stop crying. A panicked Allison called Bret, scared and unsure what to do. Bret told her to just let him cry, that he needs to let it out. Allison knew he was right, but it shook her to her core to see her dad like that, she remembers how she needed him to be strong for her one more time.

The funeral was a dignified event with the Alberta primer, old Stampede broadcaster Ed Whalen and Bret Hart giving heavy speeches. It was Stu that stood out though, demonstrating a clarity that was rare for him in his age, he spoke about the love he had for Helen, ""I'm glad for the time I had with her,"" he said full of love, but his pain was on display too, ""Ill never get over this"" he finished solemnly, ""I don't have enough time.""

Stu was still grieving Helen when he got word that his old friend Ed Whalen died just a few weeks later, of a heart attack.

A few months later, Davey Boy Smith wrestled his last match on May 11th, 2002 where he got to team with his 16 year old son. This was supposed to start his 2nd attempt at a comeback where he would bring his son in with him. Obviously that never happened, but his son looks back fondly on that match they luckily got to share.

In May 2002, Davey Boy and his girlfriend (Bruce's young wife Andrea) were on vacation when Davey Boy died in his sleep of ""natural causes."" Though the corner report had to point out all the steroid use that led to his death. Andrea claims they were discussing marriage, but Davey Boy's daughter claims he was visiting Diana 3 days before he died, attempting to get back with her.

Apparently, both Diana and Andrea held their own funeral services for Davey Boy, trying to out preform the other. Good lord.

A few weeks later Bret would suffer a stroke on his bike that left him paralyzed and hospital bed ridden for over a month. Hart remembers spending most days unable to move, crying and wondering what curse fell upon the Hart Family to cause all this misfortune. He was finally able to get himself up to walk when his dad came to visit, Bret was tearful and proud of himself as he embraced his father of his own volition.

Stu's granddaughters Jenny and Nattie had been living with him and taking care of him, giving him his medication/shots or what ever else he needed. In the months since Helen passed it seemed he was deteriorating at an alarming rate. One day in October 2001, Nattie and Jenny noticed that a cut on his arm now looked infected and took him to the hospital. There it was determined he had a staph infection and he would never be able to return to the Hart House. He would now need round the clock full time care.

On October 16th, 2001, Stu Hart died in his sleep, with Bret Hart, Bret's ex-wife Julie and Stu's granddaughter Jenny by his side. Diana was quoted hours later saying ""I think he really anticipated being with my mom again. She was reaching out to him and he was ready to go.""

Stu's funeral was the one time all the kids put their bullshit to the side and just held hands with their heads held low. Bret and Bruce even embraced for the first time in a long while, joined by Ross.

The Hart House was sold in May 2004, despite reservations from Smith who still lived there, and Bruce who wanted to turn it into a museum to make money off of. As soon as it was sold, the family decended into fights over who gets what and soon things were just disappearing altogether. Keith Hart had promised Martha a framed picture of Owen as a baby, but when he went to get it, it was gone.

The Hart House was sold with the written agreement that it wouldnt be torn down. The new owner can do as they please so long as it stays standing.

Getting Smith out of the house was a frustrating endeavor, since Smith had turned the house into a hostel of sorts, even charging street folk to spend the night. Smith was trying to cook a disgusting and smelly fish when Keith arrived to tell him he has to leave, that the house is sold and the new owner will be there soon. Keith remembers how Smith refused to leave until Keith threw the fish out the window and threatened to drop his older brother where he stands. The next day, Keith got a call from the new owners saying that if Smith isn't gone then the deal is off. Keith went to ensure he was still gone but was shocked to find Smith had climbed in a side window and had to be ran off one final time. Smith claims he installed a set of swinging doors that were his and he was just removing them before leaving for good.

While interviewing Allison for the book, the author notes how trapped in the past she was, endlessly talking about Owen, Stu, Helen, and the world that was taken from their family, the unjust acts of Vince McMahon and how much she hates him. She said she hates Vince McMahon as much as she loved her dad. Keith and Ross are both level headed and seem at peace with their past when discussing it. 

Ellie and Jim Neidhart continued their tumultuous relationship, and would be sued by a Calgary man who claims the couple broke into his house and stole $9000 worth of jewelry. It was settled out of court and Jim explains that it was a misunderstanding where he was helping the man's wife pawn jewelry for a car and forgot to pay him back. Nattie was and still is horrified and embarrassed by the story, always quick to jump to her mother's defence, explaining how she wasn't even in Calgary at the time of the incident! 

Bret Hart was able to recover from his stroke and would go on to preform in plays and other theatrical endeavors. The stroke left him in a place where he struggled to remember lines and even appointments, and while he still works out multiple times a day, it's clear he will never have even a fraction of the strength or skills he once had.

Some of Bret's siblings complain that he is too egotistical and wrapped up in the Hitman character, that they have to go through a publicist if they just want to chat with their brother. He was remarried in 2004 but didn't tell most of his family for months. Some siblings say they found out in the newspaper.

""Bruce is still substitute teaching, wearing his wrestling boots to school, his Stampede shirt on full display, his hair bleached blond as if he is ready to cut a promo. Bruce is still waiting for his big break"" Keith Hart says while talking pitifully about his older brother. Keith always blamed Bruce for pushing Stu to keep Stampede open through the 80's and for draining all the Hart Family funds to do so. Keith laments how Bruce could have got a full-time gig teaching, he could have set himself up with a pension, but he couldn't get over the idea that he would be a big star one day, like his dad. 

Keith sees Bruce as someone deluding themselves into thinking he is still young and hopeful. ""He sold his soul to wrestling"" Keith would finish saying, ""one day he will have to look at that picture of Bruce Hart ... and see what he really looks like.""

Bruce believes he is fulfilling his legacy, carrying on the Hart Family tradition saying ""I'm just an extension of Stu anyway.""

Keith hotly rejects this notion. ""Bruce was not representing of my dad. He thinks he is, but my dad didn't appreciate his style of wrestling. Bruce was not heroic in my dad's eyes, and that was the saddest thing, for maybe both of them."" Keith would say of Bruce and Stu's relationship, ""He loved my dad, but my dad never credited him as being anything. He wasn't a tough guy. He never earned my dad's respect."" Ouch...

While writing this book, the author met with most of the kids, and was hopeful that Bruce would contribute as much as Keith or Ross or Alison had, but Bruce just wanted the author to write about the new Stampede Wrestling show Bruce was starting up and how great it is. He told the author how he had turned down sending Stampede guys to the MTV/ WWE Tough Enough show on some misplaced principles he held, and how he had a movie script written that was ""better than Rocky"" and was about this small independent wrestling promotion taking down the big bad giant one that ruled the world. Bruce eventually ghosted the author when he figured out the author didn't care.

I have more to say but im running out of room on the post so ill stop it here. Ill leave a comment below that details where each kid ended up. I legitimately cant fit that here lol

Ill be back with the last Jericho post, as well as more from Vince, the Harts and that Madusa book soon. I also have some other ideas like posting a collection of all the different random road stories or backstage brawls that have been recorded in these books. Hope y'all have a great day!

REVIEW OF MERMIA!,RoyaleHigh_Roblox,1i6nmru,2025-01-21 12:15:20,6,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyaleHigh_Roblox/comments/1i6nmru/review_of_mermia/,kayspace2,Discussion,"So, my mum got me the mermia doll, and this is a little reviw or the doll itself from someone who has collected playline and none playline dolls for quite a while.

  
She's really cute aesthetics wise, the clothes are surpsingly better quality than i expected too? Where i live she retails for a 20 gbp price point, but i got her for twelve on sale. For a doll that costs 20 pounds, I'd usualky expect to see knee articulation, neck articulation, elbow articulation and wrist articulation. Mermia has all of those expect wrists, whicg is dissapointing, but not uncommon in playline dolls sometimes. 

Her hair wuality is BEAUTIFUL, its so soft, however she is slightly thinly rooted, not too badly thankfully, this is an issue with a lot of other playline dolls, and her hair is still styleable.

  
I think the worst thing is her face printing, its quite pixelated and honestly does not seem like it would take a whole lot to chip (it should be fine, but i still bave worries about it.)

  
Overall, for 20 pounds, i assume they wouldn't have had a super high budget. And they did really good with it honestly, they're designed well and the budget seemed to have been ina  way that was alloted to get you the best of both worlds with her hair and outfit. Her hair is very long, and very good quality, but i wish some of the length had been sacraficed, in order to allow more room in the budget to make the rootage if the hair better. One thing i LOVE is the face the necklace has this little plastic tube thing that connects both the end parts of it, it makes it easy to remove from the doll BUT IT LITERALLY CANNOT FALL OFF. Another note is that she doesn't fit into soem other doll clothes so well, the best tried were isney princess doll clothes, however she is compatible ith most barbie clothes,  shoes i have yet to find a good match for though."

Greek Banking System Structure
The banking sector is dominated by four major institutions: National Bank of Greece, Piraeus Bank, Alpha Bank, and Eurobank. These banks follow regulations set by the Bank of Greece, ensuring secure transactions for tourists and locals alike.
Banks in Crete¬†open from 8 AM to 2:30 PM, Monday to Friday. Some in busy areas open weekends.¬†ATMs¬†(cash machines) are everywhere‚Äînear shops, beaches, and malls. Use cards with a¬†4-digit PIN. Ask your bank about fees before traveling.

**About Power Nickel Inc.:**

Power Nickel Inc. (CVE:PNPN) (OTCMKTS:PNPNF) (FRA:IVV) is a Canadian junior exploration company focusing on developing the High-Grade Nisk project into Canada's first Carbon Neutral Nickel mine.

On February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CVE:CRE). Subsequently, Power Nickel has exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Nisk Project and delivered notice to Critical Elements that it intends to exercise its second option to bring its ownership to 80%. The last remaining commitment to exercise the option was the delivery of a NI-43-101 Technical report which has now occurred.

The Nisk property comprises a significant land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts. Power Nickel is focused on expanding the historical high-grade nickel-copper PGE mineralization with a series of drill programs designed to test the initial Nisk discovery zone and to explore the land package for adjacent potential Nickel deposits.

In addition to the Nisk project, Power Nickel owns significant land packages in British Colombia and Chile. Power Nickel is expected to reorganize these assets in a related vehicle through a plan of arrangement.

Power Nickel announced on June 8, 2021, that an agreement had been made to complete the 100% acquisition of its Golden Ivan project in the heart of the Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle has reported mineral resources (past production and current resources) in 130 million ounces of gold, 800 million ounces of silver, and 40 billion pounds of copper (Resource World). This property hosts two known mineral showings (gold ore and Magee) and a portion of the past-producing Silverado mine, reportedly exploited between 1921 and 1939. These mineral showings are Polymetallic veins containing quantities of silver, lead, zinc, plus/minus gold,

Part 2 - The Offshore Tax Haven Ramble),PersonalFinanceNZ,1i6dupw,2025-01-21 03:07:29,15,0.86,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/1i6dupw/part_2_the_offshore_tax_haven_ramble/,Jasoncatt,,"OK, firstly, for those that have been waiting, my apologies for this taking a little longer than initially mentioned. It has been a busy week at work. Also apologies also for the length of the post - it wouldn't be a ramble without a large surplus of words.   
  
Second, and by way of a disclaimer, this post is written purely for ""edutainment"" purposes, and describes my own journey to minimise my NZ tax exposure both legally and ethically, by setting up an offshore entity in a ""tax haven"" whilst creating generational wealth for my descendants. It is not financial advice,  you should get this from a professional. I am not one of those.  
  
There's a TL:DR at the end. Scroll down if you're lazy or only slightly curious.

For those of you that didn't read my previous post, it was about US estate (death) tax, and how you could protect your legacy by putting your overseas market holdings into an irrevocable trust, so that Uncle Sam couldn't claim up to 40% of your holdings at the time of your death.

This post is about how I started with the process to avoid US death taxes, but ended up setting up an offshore investment entity in a tax advantaged jurisdiction so that I could actively invest in foreign equities, maximising returns while at the same time minimising my personal tax exposure here in NZ.   
  
Everything I'm about to discuss is what I have done, for my own situation. It is both legal and doesn't evade tax in any way. I'll intentionally be a little vague in some areas to encourage you to get your own advice, as there are several ways to achieve what I have done. Plus, as mentioned, I'm not an expert - I pay others to set this up and manage it for me. Even my eyes gloss over from time to time when discussing matters with them.  
This therefore is a snapshot, a shortish (lol) view of a very long process that took almost a year to complete.  
  
Further, this is for those with significant assets, and for those that want to actively trade and invest in foreign domiciled equities, funds etc, and are therefore subject to higher taxes on their endeavours. It's not something that will even begin to benefit you until your account size reaches well over 7 figures, as the cost of setting up together the annual cost of maintaining the entity are a factor.   
  
You may be in your 40s or 50s with a business that you're looking to sell for your retirement and are wondering what to do with the proceeds. You may have a property portfolio that brings in a very healthy income which you are looking to liquidate for retirement. You may have both, as I have. Or you may just be in your 20s, wondering how this sh!t is done so you can effectively plan for your future. Either way, to achieve the most (or any) benefit from this, you will need a NW figure sufficient to make going through this process worthwhile.   
  
If your entire portfolio is in NZ domiciled PIE funds and you're looking at a retirement nest egg of anything less than say $1.5 - $2m there will be little or no benefit to you, at least in the short term (although it could still benefit you in terms of getting you to the larger account sooner). Above $4m this starts to make real sense, and anything above $6+m I would definitely recommend exploring your options.   
  
What this *isn't* about, is avoiding paying income tax on your income here in NZ. As they say, the only certainties in life are death and taxes. I pay tax on every dollar distributed to me as income and am happy to do so. However, as you will see, I legitimately pay far less tax compared to someone that has their entire portfolio domiciled in NZ (with some caveats and considerations).

So... having got that out of the way, let's dive in. 

Back in the UK as a much younger man almost 40 years ago, I would sometimes wonder how the wealthy managed to pay significantly less tax than the average man in the street. I often read about their offshore ""Tax Haven"" bank accounts, their ""Cayman Islands"" investment companies, or their ""Lichtenstein Trusts"" and I assumed that these were purely the domain of the ultra wealthy. I wasn't entirely wrong, but as I was to discover decades later, they were a great deal more accessible than I had first imagined. 

After having this thought swirling round my subconscious over the years, I finally reached the point in my journey through life where my net worth was such that I started to actively investigate the idea.   
The result below are the details of my ""offshore tax haven"" investment structure, in its three constituent parts:  
  
1: An offshore (foreign) irrevocable family trust, domiciled in the Isle of Man in the UK. Although I was the original settlor (funder) of the trust and continue to fund it until I retire, I have transferred control of the trust to appointed professional trustees. When I retire and transfer the remaining of my capital to this trust I will relinquish my role as settlor.   
I am not the beneficiary of this trust (although I am a ""discretionary beneficiary"" that benefits from it). The combination of these things ensures that as far as either the US IRS or NZ IRD are concerned, the funds and investments held in the trust are no longer mine (and indeed they are not), and are therefore not part of my personal income or holdings.   
Why in the Isle of Man? Purely convenience, although it does have its own particular benefits, i.e lower cost than other UK offshore jurisdictions such as Jersey. I could have set up in the Cayman Islands, Dubai or any number of other tax advantaged jurisdictions, but for me as a UK citizen that used to travel back to the UK regularly while my parents were alive, this made sense purely from a convenience standpoint.   
There are quite a few other moving parts to this setup which I'll exclude here, or you'll be reading all night. If you decide to follow this path, your advisers will be able to assist you on the details. 

2: There is an investment Company, owned by the family trust, whose job it is to invest the funds in the trust wisely, on behalf of future generations.

3: The trust has an independent board of trustees/directors both for the trust and investment company, whose job it is to administer the investment goals of the trust in accordance with the trust deed. 

Ok... I know what you're thinking (f#ck me, that's a huge commitment). But it is more simple than it sounds at first reading (even if it's not cheap and has many steps that need to be taken).  
  
First, setting up an irrevocable family trust in the Isle of Man wasn't much different or more expensive compared with setting one up here in New Zealand. If you estimate a similar amount of pounds as it costs here in dollars you won't be far wrong.   
Why an ""Irrevocable Family Trust""? Because an irrevocable family trust permanently and irrevocably transfers the ownership of any of the assets that it contains away from myself and into the trust, with my children as the beneficiaries. Further, the trust is structured to be ""perpetual"" so that once I've passed, succession planning becomes easier, with my children's children becoming the beneficiaries, and my children becoming the discretionary beneficiaries.

Other costs in setting up the trust:  
Aside from the bare shell of the trust, you need a very comprehensive Trust Deed, which details exactly what the trust is for, who it is to benefit, who manages it and what their roles are, plus the method by which the investments are to be managed (how the money is invested, in what asset classes, investment goals regarding active vs passive investing, growth ETFs, dividend holdings etc etc). This costs a significant amount of money to get right, with (in my case) around half a dozen revisions, discussion with tax and trust experts in both Isle of Man and here in NZ, plus my lawyer. You could easily spend a further $20k+ on this. I did. 

The Investment Company:  
A limited liability company owned by the family trust. The purpose of this is to hold brokerage accounts and invest in international equities, in line with the directives set out in the trust deed. In my case, this incudes long term growth portfolios, an income portfolio, a currency trading portfolio (for hedging) and a speculative account which can actively trade in more risky asset classes such as IPOs, early stage growth companies, etc. (This is just my structure but you could structure this any way you like, much in the way that you might have several portfolios yourself today).  
Crucially, the trust employs me as investment advisor and gives me the ability to manage the portfolios on behalf of (and in conjunction with) the trustees. This relationship between myself and the trustees is highly nuanced. I won't say more, but your trust/tax advisor will understand what I am alluding to here.

So, having done all that, what are the benefits, both for me personally, for the investment company, and for my children as beneficiaries?  
  
I'll start with the investment company:  
Well, it operates in a jurisdiction that has no corporate or income tax on gains made on investments, whether they are considered long term capital gains or gains made from actively trading assets (unlike NZ...). All gains are tax free. If the investment company turns $7 million into $15 million, whichever way it achieves it, the tax bill is $0.   
(An exception is income generated from US domiciled funds such as VOO, SCHD or any dividend bearing holding, which are subject to US withholding tax on the income derived from dividend payments. UK income holdings however are zero rated in terms on income tax on dividends. Each country where an asset is domiciled will have its own tax laws which need to be adhered to).  
  
The investment company actively invests in most asset classes, and following my advice, actively trades on equities which, had the investment fund been domiciled in NZ would be subject to tax on trading profits. These taxes are therefore avoided. Does this benefit me personally? Well no not directly, however, a faster growing investment fund allows greater distributions to me in the future, so I can still benefit from the gains. It also allows me the comfort of knowing that I'm building something that will greatly benefit future generations, in an environment where the growth is hugely tax advantaged.   
  
For my children:  
Well obviously they will receive the benefit of investments that have grown tax free over a number of decades. They only pay tax on distributions made to them, and no tax on capital distributions, provided it is structured properly, per IRD rules.    
Distributions to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets (such as the trust paying for my daughter's university education for example, or buying her a new car).  
If you think 1% fees charged annually by private fund managers compounds like crazy over say 30 years, imagine what benefit the favourable tax jurisdiction provides over the same period on an account that's achieving a CAGR of say 15%...

For me:  
Distributions are passed from the trust in several ways.   
As an investment adviser to the trust, I am paid for my advice. I pay income tax on this here in NZ. This will essentially be my retirement ""job"".  
Capital distributions - for example, the trust buys $100k of Apple shares, sells them several years later by rebalancing the portfolio, this initial capital (not the gains) can be distributed tax free (provided that NZ tax laws are also adhered to).  
Gifting. This is more complicated, but there are avenues for the beneficiaries to gift distributions or capital returns to me.  
A lot of what I would traditionally be paying for is now managed by the trust (such as my daughter's education). Mind you, that also applies to me in many ways. I live in a house that no longer belongs to me, the maintenance of which, any renovation work and upkeep is all paid for by the trust also...

Setting the structure up to be compliant with NZ tax laws:  
Ok, so this is an area that I will be intentionally vague on. Not because I don't want to tell you, but because I really don't understand all the nuances myself. I'm not an expert. If you're interested in this, you will need to get your own advice.   
  
However, some considerations that I can think of that you'll need to be aware of (and which you absolutely have to get right), amongst others are:   
  
1: IRD will need to be shown that this trust exists not for your benefit, but for the benefit of future generations.   
  
2: You will need to essentially give up any personal ownership of the assets contained in the trust. They are no longer yours - they will belong to the trust and are managed by trustees, even if under your guidance.   
  
3: The trust needs to be structured in such a way that there is a genuine reason to be domiciled offshore, rather than purely existing to avoid NZ taxes. For example, to minimise currency fluctuations to the NZ dollar (being heavily invested in US, UK and other market equities), or to enable more efficient investing in multiple assets from various global markets. In my case it was also a benefit that my children have access to British citizenship, therefore part of the raison d'√™tre for the trust is to support beneficiaries no matter where in the world they reside. You'll need advice on this as these are only the things I can remember were pertinent, and are definitely not the only things you might consider. There are other reasons that you can use.

4: You will need to ensure that you are fully compliant with NZ tax laws, as well as the tax laws of the jurisdiction where you establish your offshore entity. Everything needs to be very carefully documented and reported and NZ IRD needs to be informed of what you are doing. Needless to say, this is a minefield, and you need very specific advice on how to proceed. This can get expensive. It will get expensive. But, once done it's done. 

Downsides:  
The entity, being domiciled in a jurisdiction that doesn't have reciprocal tax agreements with the US and other countries, will have to pay withholding tax on those holdings that generate income and are liable for this. Unlike New Zealand where we have a reciprocal tax agreement with the US where I can claim withholding tax back. It's a small downside for me, as withholding tax on dividends is far outweighed by the overall tax benefits for the lion's share of the portfolios. 

It's somewhat of a shift in mindset - giving up ownership of all (or most) of your holdings and having someone else involved in the management of these assets (even if they are following your advice). As alluded to above, this external management can be structured in a way as to ensure that your own goals for the trust and its investments are still adhered to, but it does add a layer of administrative drag.   
  
For example, I cannot suddenly decide to invest in a particular asset class that isn't already documented in the trust deed. Anything out of the ordinary needs to be discussed with the trustees to ensure that the investment aligns with the trust's goals and is in the best interest of the beneficiaries. If I suddenly decide I want to invest $500k into Bitcoin because it's going to the moooooon, I can expect significant kickback from the trustees and would have to convince them of the benefits of such a move.  But... this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In all day to day investments, as long as they're aligned with the Trust's goals and solely for the benefit of the beneficiaries, and including broad investment strategies already detailed in the trust deed, I'm free to invest how I see fit. 

Setup and management costs:  
All told, this cost me around $40,000 to set up, but has ongoing management costs also. This is why you need to be above a certain level for this to make sense. I have monthly minuted online meetings with the trustees (which they charge for), plus email communications (which they charge for), plus any phone calls or other online contact (which they charge for) plus the annual accounting fees, etc, etc.   
Some of these fees, such as the accountancy fees would be necessary in an NZ domiciled fund in any case, so it's not all additional to what I would be doing anyway. 

So I think I have gone on long enough. I could continue for hours, but hopefully this gives you some insight.  Is it for everyone? No, absolutely not. However, if you're looking at building intergenerational wealth and have the resources to do something similar it may well be worth considering. 

Wrapping it all up (TL:DR)  
Actively investing a big account in overseas markets from NZ? That‚Äôs a tax buffet I don‚Äôt want second helpings of. Instead, I packed my wealth into an offshore trust, where it works hard for the next generation, tax-free as long as gains stay in the trust. I still pay my fair share on what comes back to me in NZ, because I like to keep IRD happy. 

The real winners? My kids. They get turbocharged, tax advantaged growth, with distributions that even IRD can‚Äôt touch (capital ones, that is).   
If you‚Äôve ever wondered how the wealthy keep their wallets fat while avoiding unnecessary tax, here‚Äôs one way they do it, both legally and ethically.

Is real estate investment a good idea? ,investing,1i6aktm,2025-01-20 23:31:33,0,0.41,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i6aktm/is_real_estate_investment_a_good_idea/,Odd_Section_777,,"I am currently 21 years old and I was told by my parents that they have been secretly investing on some sort of investment insurance and I am  now entitled to 75000 USD (around 60000 GBP). Coupled with my own savings my total capital would‚Äôve made up to around  100000 USD. 

I am still a student right now and will very likely start working right after I graduate, and I don‚Äôt want this bunch of money to just sit there but to create some long term passive income so I can live comfortably in the future. I currently have 5k USD in the stock market with a growth of 20% this year. The remaining of the funds are in a high interest savings account. 

I was wondering if I could start investing in real estate property 2 years after I start working. As I‚Äôm in the UK, I plan to use the Lifetime ISA, which the gov would pay 25% on top of the contribution I made on my first residential property (max.4K pounds per year). After I get my first property and stay there for 2 years, I plan to move out, fund a buy to let property via refinancing+ the capital I have. Then repeat the process. 

I have also thought of co funding with my sister which we combined would have 123 000 USD (100k GBH). And potentially start up a holdings company to invest via that company. I understand that the interest rate for a mortgage and downpayment is higher + managing a ltd would be complicated and complex. However, we reckon it would be alright as our parents are small business owners and I will likely qualify as a solicitor (quite familiar with the process). Moreover, we hope this could be long term and expand steadily.

Needed some advices on this plan, and whether this is realistic or not. Thank you so much !!!"

My guess is that while you may like one of the performers, it‚Äôs not enough to hear them perform two or three of their songs WHILE also being forced to hear Harry‚Äôs grating voice drone on and on at the event. I guess folks are just not that wild about Harry.

The opening ceremony starts on Saturday, February 8 at BC Place with Katy Perry headlining alongside other artists like Nelly Furtado and Noah Kohan. One can still purchase tickets for as low as $53.87 Canadian ($37.37 US or ¬£30.47 British pound) not including fees.

Then, the closing ceremony takes place Sunday, February 16 at the smaller venue, the Rogers Arena. Jelly Roll will be featured along with the Barenaked Ladies. The lowest priced tickets can be had at $83.05 Canadian ($57.62 US or ¬£46.88 British pound) also not including fees.

Elon Musk giving a ‚ÄòNazi salute‚Äô at Trump event.,FluentInFinance,1i68mk2,2025-01-20 21:47:27,152,0.76,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1i68mk2/elon_musk_giving_a_nazi_salute_at_trump_event/,Richest-Panda,Thoughts?,"Tesla CEO and ‚Äúfirst buddy‚Äù¬†[Elon Musk](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-urges-britons-vote-193434843.html)¬†was hit with a wave of immediate outrage online and on cable news after he made a salute that many felt was fascist during his speech at the Capitol One Arena on Monday to celebrate¬†[President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-victory-lap-ahead-inauguration-213518416.html).

While getting extremely excited about the prospect of landing a man on Mars and planting an American flag, the X (formelyTwitter) owner pounded his chest and shot his right arm in an angular motion toward the sky, saying he felt it in his ‚Äúheart.‚Äù He also turned his back to the audience and repeated the gesture towards the American flag hanging over the stage.

‚ÄúStanding ovation for Elon Musk. By far the biggest reception of the day,‚Äù CNN anchor Erin Burnett noted. ‚ÄúYou saw him come out with that odd-looking salute.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was odd-looking,‚Äù Burnett reiterated, pointing out that they would show viewers a screenshot of the moment.

Considering the strange spectacle and the similarities to a particular other controversial hand motion, it didn‚Äôt take long for critics of the Trump-backing billionaire and Doge chief to exclaim online what they thought the world‚Äôs richest man was doing at that moment.

‚ÄúYeah Elon gave a Sieg Heil,‚Äù one user¬†[posted on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/slothropsmap.bsky.social/post/3lg74zwkma227), while others pointedly accused him of giving a¬†[‚ÄúNazi salute‚Äù.](https://x.com/rcmoya84/status/1881431062288679253)

‚ÄúOur new co-president Elon Musk gives a Nazi salute on day one of Trump presidency,‚Äù Democratic strategist Sawyer Hackett¬†[tweeted](https://x.com/SawyerHackett/status/1881437127889793099)¬†while sharing a clip of the gesture.

At the same time, while liberals and Maga detractors flooded social media with videos of Musk‚Äôs provocative wave to the crowd, there was nothing in Musk‚Äôs excitable pro-Trump speech that explicitly referenced fascism and Nazism ‚Äî and it is almost certain that the tech mogul would deny that he was making that gesture during a celebration of the new president.

Indeed,¬†[many other observers](https://x.com/hasanthehun/status/1881430573543268733)¬†suggested that Musk was instead performing a¬†[‚ÄúRoman salute‚Äù](https://x.com/PhilNvestigates/status/1881434200236318917)¬†that soldiers in the ancient empire would use to greet their commanders as a show of respect and loyalty. The Roman salute, however, was¬†[later adopted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute)¬†in some forms by fascist states ‚Äî including Nazi Germany,¬†[as some noted](https://x.com/DMichaelTripi/status/1881435792352141551). Additionally, right-wing extremists¬†[celebrated](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-salute-reaction-right-wing-extremists-1235241866/)¬†the alarming gesture. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if this was a mistake. I‚Äôm going to enjoy the tears over it,‚Äù neo-Nazi leader Christopher Pollhaus wrote on Telegram.

Some journalists, meanwhile, just¬†[shared the strange moment online](https://x.com/ChristopherJM/status/1881431645984813344)¬†and allowed others to make up their minds as to what exactly Musk was doing. Supporters of the billionaire, on the other hand, insisted that Musk was being misrepresented and taken out of context.

‚ÄúElon Musk was excited and spread his hand to the crowd. Every leftist is going to try and characterize this as a Nazi salute,‚Äù one[¬†X user wrote](https://x.com/IX_Amendment/status/1881434887586263440), while another¬†[called on ‚ÄúCommunity Notes‚Äù to get involved](https://x.com/nancytsidley/status/1881441817071411574)¬†and point out that he merely ‚Äúwas extending his heart to the crowd‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a person with a \*strong\* track record of criticizing Elon Musk, I feel extremely confident asserting that this was not a Nazi salute. Elon Musk is a friend to the Jews,‚Äù¬†*Newsweek*¬†opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon[¬†insisted](https://x.com/bungarsargon/status/1881439445523775961). ‚ÄúThis is a man with Aspergers exuberantly throwing his heart to the crowd. We don‚Äôt need to invent outrage.‚Äù

Musk¬†[later shared a clip](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1881438950218510700)¬†of his entire speech on X, though the video ‚Äî which he pulled from another user ‚Äî curiously did not show the first salute he gave to the crowd. The footage was from Fox‚Äôs Live Now broadcast.

*The Independent*¬†has reached out to Musk and X for comment.

The frenzy over Musk‚Äôs salute parallels that of another Trump acolyte who set the internet on fire when she made a similar gesture at the Republican National Convention in 2016. During her speech in Cleveland that year, Fox News star Laura Ingraham unleashed a rallying cry for Trump as he was set to accept the GOP nomination for president.

‚ÄúI want to say this very plainly: We should all‚Äîeven all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos, we love you‚Äîbut you must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump now,‚Äù she exclaimed, followed by her immediately shooting her right hand up in an angular fashion. Much like Musk is now, she was¬†[accused of performing a fascist salute](https://www.indy100.com/news/this-woman-accidentally-did-a-nazi-salute-at-the-republican-convention-7302851), and edited clips of her speech quickly became a meme.

‚ÄúI do not think it is fair to say Laura Ingraham capped off her remarks at the Republican National Convention by giving a Nazi salute,‚Äù Slate writer Josh Voorhees¬†[wrote at the time](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/07/laura-ingrahams-nazi-salute-examined.html). ‚ÄúHowever, I do think it is fair to say that Laura Ingraham capped off her remarks at the Republican National Convention with a hand gesture that, intentionally or not,¬†*clearly resembled a Nazi salute*.‚Äù

As for what does and doesn‚Äôt constitute a Hitler salute, the Anti-Defamation League¬†[notes](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/hitler-salute-hand-sign)¬†that ‚Äúit consists of raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down,‚Äù adding that it is ‚Äúoften accompanied by chanting or shouting ‚ÄòHeil Hitler‚Äô or ‚ÄòSieg Heil.‚Äô‚Äù Additionally, the ADL states that since the end of World War II, ‚Äúneo-Nazis and other white supremacists have continued to use the salute, making it the most common white supremacist hand sign in the world.‚Äù

However, the ADL decided on Monday afternoon that whatever Musk did at the Capitol One Arena didn‚Äôt meet the mark of an actual fascist gesture, describing it as merely ‚Äúawkward.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a delicate moment. It‚Äôs a new day and yet so many are on edge. Our politics are inflamed, and social media only adds to the anxiety. It seems that u/elonmusk

 made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,‚Äù the organization¬†[said in a statement](https://x.com/ADL/status/1881474892022919403). ‚ÄúIn this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath. This is a new beginning. Let‚Äôs hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.‚Äù

Notably, Musk and the ADL had been at odds over the billionaire‚Äôs previous embrace of antisemitic tropes, namely the ‚Äúgreat replacement theory,‚Äù while the X owner¬†[threatened legal action](https://www.independent.co.uk/business/elon-musk-threatens-to-sue-the-antidefamation-league-over-lost-revenue-on-x-b2405013.html)¬†over¬†[lost ad revenue](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/elon-musk-ap-ibm-media-matters-adolf-hitler-b2449221.html)¬†that he blamed on the ADL‚Äôs¬†[accusations of antisemitism](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-ap-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-israel-b2454182.html)¬†on the social media platform. ADL chief Jonathan Greenblatt, however,¬†[eventually praised](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/4321955-adl-chief-defends-praise-musk/)¬†Musk for suggesting he would ban the pro-Palestinian phrases ‚Äúfrom the river to sea‚Äù and ‚Äúdecolonization,‚Äù commending him for his ‚Äúleadership in fighting hate.‚Äù Greenblatt‚Äôs about-face and apparent embrace of Musk prompted criticism and¬†[even resignations](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-defamation-league-elon-musk-jonathan-greenblatt-antisemitism-critics-interviews-1234897065/)¬†from the ADL itself.

Meanwhile, the outrage over Musk making this particular gesture twice onstage during Trump‚Äôs inauguration comes after the SpaceX chief had already drawn intense backlash for throwing his support behind the far-right Alternative for Deutschland, a German political party that has¬†[ties to neo-Nazis](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/europe/elon-musk-afd-germany.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)¬†and whose youth wing has been described as¬†[‚Äúextremist‚Äù](https://x.com/peterbakernyt/status/1870182998584254880)¬†by German intelligence agencies. Musk[¬†later hosted](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-hosts-german-far-004629888.html)¬†the AfD leader for a lengthy conversation on X.

On top of that, Musk also[¬†recently signaled](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/musk-changes-x-handle-kekius-203627941.html)¬†further support for the far-right when he changed his X username to ‚ÄúKekius Maximus‚Äù and updated his profile to an edited picture of ‚ÄúPepe the Frog,‚Äù a meme that had been co-opted by the alt-right and white supremacists in online spaces such as 4chan. And just a week ago, Musk ‚Äî who has¬†[relentlessly promoted](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-says-minister-prison-113231858.html)¬†imprisoned far-right extremist¬†[Tommy Robinson](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tommy-robinson-high-court-jamal-hijazi-solicitor-general-woolwich-crown-court-b2662096.html)¬†while injecting himself into British politics ‚Äî¬†[criticized](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/world/europe/neo-nazi-uk-riots-elon-musk.html)¬†the prison sentencing of a neo-Nazi who helped incited riots in the UK.

Midnight at the mountains of Mourne,CreepCast_Submissions,1i68525,2025-01-20 21:22:28,4,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1i68525/midnight_at_the_mountains_of_mourne/,Swagemandbagem,please narrate me Papa ü•π,"I remember the first time I saw the Mountains of Mourne in the mist. It was a Friday, just after the rain had passed, and the clouds were still clinging to the peaks like a shroud over a corpse. I was young then, just fifteen, but already too familiar with the violent world of Northern Ireland ‚Äî a world that made your skin crawl and your heart beat like a drum at night. The Troubles were in full swing, and the air was thick with fear, suspicion, and the crackle of gunfire.

It was my uncle Dan who first took me to the mountains. He was a quiet man, the kind whose silence made you nervous, as if he were hiding something just out of reach. He was a big man, broad-shouldered with hands that looked like they could break a neck in a second. I'd always known that Dan was involved in things ‚Äî things my mother warned me to stay away from, even if she didn't say it outright.

""We‚Äôre going to the Mournes tomorrow at dusk,"" he'd said, his voice low and grave, like a whisper from the grave itself. ""Some business that needs attending to.""

I didn‚Äôt ask questions. No one did, not with the way things were at the time. My cousins had been involved with the IRA for years, but Dan, though he wasn't as vocal about it, was tied to the underground in ways most people couldn't imagine. I just knew that if he said ""business,"" you did it ‚Äî no matter what. His calls were cryptic, but they were never ignored.

We drove out of Belfast in the early evening, the sky darkening like the bruises on a child‚Äôs skin. As we got closer to the mountains, the landscape began to twist and change. The rolling hills gave way to jagged rocks and cliffs that seemed to claw at the sky. It was like a place out of time, untouched by anything human.

We parked the car by a small stone wall, the engine‚Äôs dying hum mixing with the faint sounds of birds calling from the trees. Dan didn‚Äôt say a word as we climbed over the wall and made our way up the rough path that led into the hills.

The air was colder now, and I felt the hairs on the back of my neck rise. We passed the ruins of old stone cottages, their windows shattered, their roofs caved in. Remnants of a time long gone, but not a time before the British had come, I knew. Every step seemed to echo in the emptiness, like the mountains themselves were watching us.

Eventually after a long, wordless hike, we went off the course up to the peak, instead veering into the woods in a slightly flatter area. A few minutes later we reached a small clearing, a patch of land where the grass grew tall and wild. There were trees in every direction, but where we stood we could see clearly up to the night sky. In the centre of the clearing there were a bunch of large rocks of about the same size, some toppled over in a vague circle. But the way the ground devoted in some spots and shaped around the rocks told me that at some point in time, they must‚Äôve been placed more uniformly. Dan stopped, his eyes scanning the murky woods. He pulled something from his jacket ‚Äî a package wrapped in brown paper ‚Äî and laid it carefully on the ground.

""Wait here,"" he muttered.

I didn‚Äôt argue. I knew better than to ask questions. But something about the place set my nerves on edge. It was as if the land itself was alive, and it didn't want us there. The wind whispered through the trees, and I could hear the faint crackling of static in the air, as if the mountains themselves were speaking in a language I couldn‚Äôt understand.

I turned my back for just a moment, trying to steady my breath, and that‚Äôs when I heard it. A voice. Low and guttural, like a growl or a murmur, coming from somewhere deep in the woods.

""Dan‚Ä¶"" I breathed, but my voice was swallowed by the wind. My eyes scanned the trees, but I saw nothing.

My heart raced. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd heard it at all or if the stress of the situation had finally gotten to me. But I knew something was wrong. The air felt thick, oppressive, like it was pressing down on my chest. I could hear the wind pick up, swirling around us in a frenzy.

And then, I saw it.

It was a figure, that much I could make out. It was standing out in the trees, half hidden in the shadows.

I froze. My breath caught in my throat.

""Dan."" I said again, but the words came out strangled, as if something had lodged in my chest. My uncle was still standing by the package, his back turned to me, unaware.

The figure in the trees moved closer. It moved in an unnatural way. You know how in older video games, characters don‚Äôt exactly walk, they sort of just slide glide forward while displaying a walking animation? It was like that. I wanted to run, but my legs felt like they were made of stone, unable to move, as if the mountains themselves had taken root in my bones.

And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure was gone. No footsteps, no rustling of leaves. Like it had melted back into the earth.

""Come on, lad,"" Dan called, his voice flat. ""Job‚Äôs done.""

I blinked, my heart still pounding, and when I looked up again, the clearing was empty. The figure was gone, as if it had never been there. My mind was spinning, but I forced myself to walk over to my uncle. He gave me a sharp look, but I said nothing. There were a lot of things you just didn‚Äôt talk about in Northern Ireland back then.

Later, when we were driving back down the mountain road, I asked him, almost against my will, ""Who was that man? Was he one of ours?""

Dan didn‚Äôt answer at first. He just kept his eyes on the road, the headlights cutting through the mist like two white knives. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he spoke.

""Not everything that roams these lands are our of society, of our factions, lad. Some things never left. And some things... they come back. Forget about tonight. What happened tonight stays here, up in the Mournes.""

I didn‚Äôt ask any more questions after that.

But I‚Äôve never forgotten the look in his eyes that night. The terror behind them. Not then, not now, and not five years later, when I returned to that place.

I joined the IRA in 1973, as soon as I turned eighteen. The Troubles were in full bloom, each day a new round of bloodshed and madness. In the streets of Belfast, you couldn‚Äôt go a day without hearing the crack of gunfire or the screech of tires as another bomb went off. You could feel it in the air, a tension so thick it seemed to press down on your chest, making it hard to breathe. People looked at each other like they were waiting for a reason to pull a trigger. It was the kind of place that could make even the toughest man turn soft, or worse, make him tough in ways you didn‚Äôt want to know. And for a long time, I knew I wanted to fight for our cause.

Back then, I would have died for a united Ireland. Without hesitation. But that changed, when I returned to the Mountains of Mourne.

It was the winter of ‚Äô76, the year everything started to spiral out of control. The British had made it clear that they weren‚Äôt backing down, and neither were we. The war had become a game of attrition‚Äîtit-for-tat ambushes, bombings, checkpoints, and killings. The usual. I was a lieutenant in the Belfast unit at the time, just a kid by the standards of the older men, but I had a reputation. You didn‚Äôt make it as far as I did without learning how to kill with precision, how to move in silence, how to erase every trace of your presence in the world. But that wasn‚Äôt what mattered to the ones who called the shots. What mattered was my loyalty. And when they said jump, I jumped.

""Tommy,"" said Callaghan, one of the senior men in the barracks, his eyes burning with some fever I couldn‚Äôt place. He was a hard bastard, the kind who didn't flinch at much. His face was a craggy map of scars, the kind of man you wanted on your side if things went south. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going up to the Mournes tomorrow night. There‚Äôs a job for you, a special one. Just you.‚Äù

I remember the weight of his words, the way he said it‚Äîlike it wasn‚Äôt a question, but a command. There wasn‚Äôt a shred of doubt in his voice. I nodded, not wanting to ask too many questions.

I remember thinking it was odd, being sent alone. I‚Äôd always been part of a team‚Äîguys you could rely on when the shots rang out. But not this time. Callaghan didn‚Äôt give me much more than that‚Äîjust a nod, a brief handshake, and a look that told me not to ask questions. I didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how things worked. You didn‚Äôt ask, you just did. And yes, of course I‚Äôd always harboured a weird feeling towards the mountains of Mourne. Even though I had stowed away the memories of my visit to the place with my uncle five years ago in some corner of my brain, the idea of returning to the place filled me with dread.

I didn‚Äôt like it, but that didn‚Äôt matter. I had orders.

About a month passed, and the date of the mission rolled around. I packed light‚Äîa pistol, a spare mag, a grenade, and a map of the area. Sure, I knew what the objective was: Go to the location on the mountain chosen by the information broker and collect the document; but in truth I had no idea what I was really walking into. None of us ever really did. But Callaghan was always able to remind us that it wasn‚Äôt just one mission, one robbery, one shootout ‚Äì it was a war, no matter what label the Brits put on it. And when a man like that tells you to do something, you just do it.

I grabbed my pack and made the long drive down the narrow roads toward the mountains, the sky bruised purple with the coming night. As I came to the outskirts of Belfast the night grew wet and cold. The rain beat down on the windshield like it was angry, like the weather itself was trying to stop me. But I didn‚Äôt care. I was used to it.

¬†As the city faded behind me, the air grew heavier. That was around the time the weight of things settled in my chest. Back to that place, back to the mountains of fucking Morne. I drove through Newry, but it wasn‚Äôt long before the familiar roads fell away, and the land opened up in front of me‚Äîa cold, dark expanse of rocky terrain, blanketed in mist. The Mournes, rising high and impossible, looming over me, an old nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake from.

When I arrived at the foot of Slieve Donard, the highest peak, I left the car parked by the side of the road and started on foot. The night had already swallowed the daylight, and the mountains seemed to hold their breath as I walked. The air grew colder with each step, and the silence pressed against me like a physical thing. There was no wind, no sound of animals, no rustling of the trees. It was as though the mountain itself was waiting. Watching.

As I climbed the trail, the mist grew thicker, curling around me like a living thing, a slow-moving fog that swallowed everything in its path. The crunch of my boots against the stones was the only sound for miles. The mountains stretched ahead of me, vast and cold, their peaks shrouded in the darkness of night. Every step felt heavier, like the land itself was pulling me down.

I didn‚Äôt know why I was here. Why this was the location chosen by an information broker. I‚Äôd asked Callaghan once, a few weeks back, when the orders first came through. But he just gave me that look‚Äîthe one that told me to keep my mouth shut.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand when you get there,‚Äù he said, and that was all.

I knew the terrain well enough. I‚Äôd done plenty of jobs in the various hills around Belfast, plenty of walking through fog and shadow. And I‚Äôd never forgotten that night with Dan years ago. It scared me, I feel no shame in admitting it. But orders were orders. This felt different to any mission before, though. There was something about the air, something about the way the landscape seemed to close in on me, that made me feel like prey.

I reached the spot the map marked for my destination by the time the moon was full overhead, casting long, thin shadows across the ground. An open area, close to the very peak of the mountain. I paused for a moment, my senses on edge, but I forced myself to walk towards the centre. My orders were clear: meet the contact, get the information, and return. That was it. No questions. Quiet, no fuss.

The fog was so dense up here that I genuinely couldn‚Äôt know for certain if the person I was sent to meet was there or not. But as I hesitantly made my way forward, something changed. The air thickened, the temperature dropping even further, until I could see my breath hanging in the air like smoke. I didn‚Äôt understand it. The cold wasn‚Äôt normal. It wasn‚Äôt just winter cold. It was a deep, unnatural cold that seemed to come from the very ground beneath my feet and encompassed me up to the tip of my scalp.

And then I heard it.

A voice. Low, guttural, and ancient.

‚ÄúTommy McGrath‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt a human voice. It was‚Ä¶ older. It came from the earth itself, from the stones. It was as though the mountain was speaking directly to me. My heart raced, my hand instinctively reaching for the pistol at my side.

‚ÄúTommy‚Ä¶‚Äù The voice repeated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chosen.‚Äù

The words echoed in my head, vibrating through my bones.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I whispered, not meaning to speak aloud, but unable to stop myself.

The mist swirled around me, thickening, until I could barely see the hand in front of my face. A figure emerged from the fog‚Äîa man, tall and thin, dressed in black. His face was hidden in shadow, but I knew it was him. Callaghan. It had to be.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come,‚Äù Callaghan‚Äôs voice came from the figure, but it wasn‚Äôt quite his voice. It was deeper, older. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time.‚Äù

‚ÄúTime for what?‚Äù I demanded, stepping back, my grip tightening on the gun. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äôs going on here, Callaghan?‚Äù

He stepped closer, his eyes gleaming like coal in the dim light. And then he smiled. But it wasn‚Äôt the kind of smile I‚Äôd ever seen on him before. It was the smile of someone who knew something you didn‚Äôt‚Äîsomething you could never know. A smile that was as old as the hills themselves.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been chosen, Tommy,‚Äù he said again, this time with a slow, deliberate drawl. ‚ÄúFor the final stage of the war. The war you don‚Äôt understand yet.‚Äù

I stared at him, not sure if he was speaking in riddles or if I was just losing my mind in the mountains.

‚ÄúListen, I don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about, but this isn‚Äôt funny. Where‚Äôs the contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no contact,‚Äù Callaghan said, his voice suddenly cold. ‚ÄúThere never was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat in God‚Äôs name are you playing at?‚Äù

But Callaghan didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, the fog around us thickened again, and the ground beneath my feet trembled. The stones of the circle began to glow faintly, a sickly green light pulsing from within them. I took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but the fear in my chest held me in place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been part of this all along, Tommy,‚Äù Callaghan continued, his eyes burning with an intensity that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. ‚ÄúYou were chosen before you even knew what was happening. The mountains have chosen you. The war was never just about politics, or even blood. It‚Äôs about something much older.‚Äù

I shook my head, trying to process his words, but they didn‚Äôt make sense. The Troubles wasn‚Äôt a war for gods or for land. This was a war for the Irish people, a war for survival.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeding it,‚Äù Callaghan said, as though reading my thoughts. ‚ÄúThe blood. The violence. The hatred. The Mournes have fed on it for centuries. You, and all the others like you, are just the latest offering.‚Äù ¬†The stone circle began to tremble, and the figures in the fog moved closer.

Callaghan stepped forward, and I realized with a sickening certainty that he wasn‚Äôt one of us. He was one of them. A servant of whatever dark force had been awakened in the Mournes. A force that fed on blood, on war, on the sacrifices we made without even knowing it.

He grinned again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been feeding it, Tommy. And now it‚Äôs time for you to give it what it wants.‚Äù

With that, the fog closed in further. I reached for my gun, ready to blow a whole through Callaghan, but he‚Äôd already sank back into the fog. And I never saw him again, not after all these years.

I stumbled after him, but lost my way, running blindly, and eventually I realised that I was lying to myself if I believed I was chasing him. I was really running away in fear. I used to think the scariest thing in the world was the guy in the streets of Belfast who would shoot you without a thought. But I was wrong. I hadn‚Äôt felt fear like this before in my life.

I kept running, running, running downhill and found my way into a wooded area. It wasn‚Äôt long before I came upon a clearing‚Äîa wide space where there were no trees. And then to my absolute horror, I realised where I really was. There, in the middle, was the old stone circle. Where Dan took me all those years ago. I stood there for a moment, staring at the stones in total helplessness. In the dim light of the moon, I realised that the stones were different to how I remembered them. I could see faint markings on them‚Äîsymbols I couldn‚Äôt understand and words in old Gaelic I couldn‚Äôt translate; under British occupation we were never taught our country‚Äôs own language. They were the kind of things you might expect to find on a tombstone or a forgotten altar. It was as if someone had carved them into the rocks long ago, as if the earth itself had grown old with them, even though I knew they‚Äôd been placed sometime in the last five years

Then I heard it.

A voice. Low, rumbling, like a growl from deep beneath the earth.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come.‚Äù

I froze. The voice didn‚Äôt sound like a man, or even a human at all. It was as if the mountain itself had spoken, the words carried on the wind, vibrating in my chest. My breath caught, and I gripped the gun at my side.

But then, through the fog, I saw movement. Figures, tall and gaunt, slipping in and out of the mist. They weren‚Äôt quite people‚Äîmore like shadows, their bodies flickering like candle flames caught in a gust of wind. They moved without sound, without footsteps, their faces obscured by the fog.

My heart hammered in my chest.

‚ÄúLeave now, or you‚Äôll never leave.‚Äù

I spun around. There, just outside the stone circle, staring straight at me from just a metre or two away was a man‚Äîor at least, what looked like one. His clothes were tattered, like he‚Äôd been out here for years, and his face was impossibly pale, almost milk white, as though he hadn‚Äôt seen the sun in decades. His eyes were dark, not the kind of dark you‚Äôd expect, but great black orbs in his sockets with no visible iris, pupils or white parts. Even hunched over, he towered over me, his arms hanging down to almost his shins.

And his voice. His voice was the same as the growl. It came from somewhere deep inside him, like it was being pulled out by something far older than him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve trespassed on sacred ground, soldier,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here. You were never meant to find us.‚Äù

And then I understood.

The man wasn‚Äôt human. No, not exactly. He was something far older, something tied to the land, to the mountains themselves. He wasn‚Äôt here by choice. He was a part of the Mournes. A part of the ancient earth that had seen too much bloodshed, too many sacrifices, too much history soaked into the soil.

And I‚Äî*I*‚Äîhad just walked into the middle of it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see?‚Äù he said, low and rasping as he drew closer to me. ‚ÄúThis land has known war long before the likes of your armies ever set foot on it. It‚Äôs soaked in the blood of those who died here, in battles you‚Äôll never understand. And now you‚Äôre part of it.‚Äù

I stumbled back, the weight of his words sinking in. The mountains, the stones, the fog‚Äîeverything around me seemed alive now, as though the earth itself was watching me, judging me. The men I had killed, the bombs I had planted, the lives I had taken‚Äîsuddenly it all felt like a grain of sand in an ocean of blood, meaningless against the weight of something far darker.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never leave, Tommy,‚Äù the being whispered again, and for the first time, I felt it‚Äî*the pull*. It wasn‚Äôt just in my head; it was physical, like the earth itself was reaching for me, drawing me into the stones, into the silence of the mountains.

For a moment, I stood there, my mind spinning, my body frozen. And then the truth hit me like a slap to the face. This wasn‚Äôt about a simple message. It wasn‚Äôt about the IRA, or the war, or Callaghan or some mission. It was about something far older, far darker than anything I‚Äôd ever known.

The Mournes weren‚Äôt just mountains. They were a place of power, a place of blood, a place where the past never died.

And I had trespassed. I had disturbed the land.

The fog began to swirl, faster now, the whispers louder, more insistent. I could feel the cold grip of the mountain on my chest, and I knew‚ÄîI knew‚ÄîI would never leave this place. Not really.

More and more figures flickered in and out of my peripheral in the fog as the impossible being I was facing took a final step forward and looked at me, his almost mummified, haunting face twisted into an expression of what seemed to be pity.

‚ÄúYou were never meant to leave,‚Äù he rasped, quieter now despite him being right in front of me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be lost for as long as you live, tied to this place. You and I and those who here already and those to come.‚Äù I blinked, and suddenly the fog was completely gone, the wraith-like things swirling in it disappeared with it. But not whoever I was speaking to. Before my eyes he remained.

‚ÄúPlease leave now, soldier, you may be lucky enough to not lose yourself.‚Äù

And with that, he turned around, and slowly walked away unnaturally, back into the trees

As I turned and ran, my feet stumbling over the uneven ground, I felt the darkness closing in around my mind. The mountain‚Äôs voice echoed in my ears, a low, suffocating hum.

*You were never meant to leave.*

And when I finally looked back, all I saw was the fog, and the cold, empty stones of the Mourne Mountains.

And I knew, then, that I was lost. Forever. I‚Äôve lived a long life, left the IRA, started a family and made the best of the world despite the things I‚Äôd done as a soldier. But through all of it, the call of the mountains has never left me, never given my mind true peace. The mountains of Mourne want me to come back, and I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll be able to resist their pull. My wife‚Äôs been dead just over a year now. My son never came back from America for longer than a week at a time once he finished college and moved there to pursue some dream or the other.

I‚Äôm just an old man with declining health living alone in the same old Belfast street, and the Mournes haunt me more than ever before. I fear the day I‚Äôll give in and give myself to the mountains, let them take me fully, but I often wonder if maybe they already have.

The war was never meant to end ‚Äì it was meant to feed the darkness, forever."
Is it fair to conflate the British government with the english east India company in terms of judging Britain‚Äôs moral culpability in company India? (Unanswered question from r/Askhistorians),BEIC_EastIndiaCompany,1i67n80,2025-01-20 20:57:55,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BEIC_EastIndiaCompany/comments/1i67n80/is_it_fair_to_conflate_the_british_government/,Vir-victus,Unanswered questions :snoo_thoughtful:,"A since unfortunately deleted user made [this very interesting and intriguing contribution](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/vo5vgk/is_it_fair_to_conflate_the_british_government/) to r/AskHistorians, however to no avail - sadly. Just like the other posts for this flair 'Unanswered questions', this one makes a fine addition to our collection and likewise, further context for the question was added:

>Basically the title. My question is it fair to criticise the uk for what the east India company did before the company was nationalised in 1858. To me it seems that before that point it is somewhat unfair to blame the uk as although the east India was an english company, it was a seperate entity from the uk and thus maybe doesn‚Äôt implicate the uk in its crimes. This might be a bad metaphor, but blaming the uk for India during company rule seems like blaming Switzerland for what nestle‚Äôs humanitarian crimes (big maybe) . Is this a valid interpretation until 1858 or a time before that or never? 

TLDR: Yes, though to a certain degree. Previous posts have already amply demonstrated the changes made in Indian administration long before 1858. Most notably: the India Act of 1784 and further subsequent changes of the like. The Board of Control, now supreme authority to the Company and British India, has to greenlight all major decisions made by the Directors, and three members from this Board eventually became Governor Generals of British India. The Governor Generals from the 1780s onwards (with one exception)- British statesmen acting on behalf of the British state, several of them former members of the Board of Control.

What you see above, is the paragraph as written in an earlier post, to give a short and concise answer, a teaser if you will, that now shall be expanded upon. Unlike what most people think, in regards to the administration of British India, it was NOT a clean cut in 1858 with the Government of India Act - the Crown assuming control and responsibility when before they had none. The British state had started to assume control and supervision over Indian affairs (as they did with the affairs of the Company itself) as early as 1773, when the aptly named Regulating Act started a gradual process of the State taking ever so more control and autonomy away from the East India Company to place and vest it into its own hands ever so firmly. 

Now to start off, 'Company India' usually refers to the period between 1757 and 1858, the time when the EIC exerted control over a sizeable amount of territory on the Indian subcontinent. A common misconception in this regard is the misbelief that during these 100 years, the Company controlled ALL of India (and thus, Britain ruled over the subcontinent for almost 200 years). British influence and British-controlled territory expanded in a gradual process from 1757 onwards, at which time it was comprised of hardly more than the province of Bengal. With that out of the way, lets look at the timeline pre-1773: When the Company was initially founded, the Government (Crown) explicitly reserved the right to terminate the Companys Charter if it deemed its desires were not met (or if the Company was found to be lacking in fulfilling its duties and obligations to the Crown). Over the course of the 17th century, the various Charters as issued for the EIC granted it extensive privileges of administrative, military as well as judicial nature. Diplomacy and warfare could be conducted pretty much autonomously, laws devised, implemented and judged upon, troops locally recruited and used. In a way, the Royal Grants of the 17th century formed the foundation for the EICs future. Though however it should be noted that neither Company nor Crown or Government back then endeavoured, desired or envisioned the conquest of the subcontinent. Be that as it may, it still boils down to this: - ***the Company eventually became what and how it was, because Britain (in the 17th century: England) gave it the means to do so. As such and in that particular aspect, the Government already is to be attributed partial blame, if only indirectly.***

That being said, the Government maintained its ''hands-off'' approach tol colonial government in the Companys outposts and territories throughout the 17th and most of the 18th centuries. Meanwhile, Company and Government were closely intertwined regardless, as many stockolders (at least the wealthier ones) were in some way part of or affiliated with English/British nobility or the financial elite, and vice versa many members of Parliament were holding shares with the EIC. The situation significantly changed in the mid-18th century as the Company abruptly seized de facto control of the large, prosperous and immensely populous region of Bengal, which in turn allowed several of its Employees to become monstrously and absurdedly rich quite immediately. Such men, also referred to as 'nabobs' would then proceed to buy their way into British politics, and the already close inter-personal link between Corporate and Government became ever more apparent. In addition, the East India Company acquired the right to collect tax revenue from three Indian pronvinces - including Bengal - iin 1765, thereby gaining access to a new, lucrative source of income. Meanwhile Britain was hard-pressed for cash, as the Wars of the mid-18th century had proven to be a considerable drain on the state finances, and any untapped stream of profits was something to get a hold on. Problematic however was, that the tax revenues (diwani) were the Companys property, not the state's. But the state was not the only one in financial distress: The Company was facing a similar dilemma, though despite not with quite the same magnitude, the eventual consequences derived from it were more severe in their case. At the brink of bankruptcy with 1.2-1.4 million pounds in debt between 1772-1773, a bailout was required, but it came at a cost. The price to be paid included new regulations and reforms to the Company, Indian administration, corporate transparency and marked the beginning of a new timeline: one of an increasing amount of government intervention to ensure both more oversight and indirect control over Indian affairs. Further, the rampant corruption among Company servants, the risk of bankruptcy as well as a devastating famine in Bengal from 1769 onwards made a Government intervention not just desirable or convenient, but necessary. ***- Though up to this point any real-time involvement of Government authority or State representatives was not yet present and 'direct' involvement minimal, the interconnection between Company and State on a personal level is not be dismissed out of hand. This doesnt amount to any real culpability on Britains part, but it highlights the close connection between Corporation and state, as the supposed separation to exist between them (as OOP alleges and compares with a modern equivalent) did indeed NOT exist.***

We now reach Phase three: Government oversight - 1773-1858. As you can see from the dates, this heavily overlaps with the time of Company India, almost entirely, save for the latters first 16 years. The aforementioned Regulating Act of 1773 implemented a series of changes, including the introduction of the office of the Governor General. Documents were passed up the chain of command, from the Governor General to the Company, the latter answerable to Parliament. This ensured more transparency and supervision of the Government over Indian affairs. A more profound impact on this matter (or rather: towards more government control) was achieved with the India Act of 1784. We have elaborated on this and its contents before on this sub, so I will try to be reasonably brief: The Board of Control is established - it is formed by three out of six special Commissioners. Members are individuals of the political elite and the government, such as a Secretary of State. Many of the Boards presidents are Secretary of Home, Foreign or War. Permament member: the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which, from 1784-1801 is also the Prime Minister. The Board gets access to all documents and communiques of the East India Company. Though the Companys Directors still draw up the instructions for the local authorities (such as the Governors) in India, these (instructions) forthwith have to be ratified by the Board first. The latter also enjoys the privilege of almost totally circumventing/bypassing the EICs Directors by crafting its own orders in matters pertaining to war or diplomacy. However due to the geographical distance between Europe and India, the Governors and the Governor General enjoyed a great deal of semi-autonomy. In order to compensate, the Board ensured (the India Act mandated) its required consent to any potential candidate to the just mentioned position. The outcome of this arrangement was a near-total favoritism towards State Representatives: Generals and Military Commanders (Lord Cornwallis), Politicians and Parliamentarians - sometimes former members of the Board (Lord Mornington, Lord Ellenborough). In short, people that could be trusted to rather act in the states best interests rather than the Companys; after 1785 only ONE of the formally appointed Governor Generals was a Company man. ***- After 1785 (and as far as knowledge and transparecy is concerned, after 1773), the British government KNOWS what is going on in India, and every instruction that is sent to India would have been approved by it beforehand. In India, it would reach a Governor General who was a State Servant (militarily or politically) and was placed there because of this. As such, the British government, now (if partially indirectly) involved, does deserve blame for the time of Company India.***

Summary: Britain and the East India Company were not quite as separate entities as a modern-day standpoint on the matter might suggest. For the first 150 years, Company India did not really exist yet, and while the Government aka. Britain remained largely uninvolved, it did equip the Company with the powers and capabilities needed to perform the tasks expected of it and later enabling it to amass a large territory. So far, partial blame. What follows between 1757-1773 (or 1757-1784) is a relatively short period where the Company Raj did indeed exist (thought not yet as large) without any government intervention as of yet. Given that the period after 1784 (which accounts for most of the time of Company India) does include a fair amount of State involvement, though to varying/increasing degrees, the proverbial window, or rather the time frame where there was a Company India without British involvement was rather short, not even three decades long. - Both for providing the foundational elements of the Company Raj and its involvement (by ratifying orders or appointing people pursuing expansion and overseeing local developments as well as allowing and enabling this), the British state, being in a symbiotic relationship with the EIC, certainly was an accomplice and bears blame for it. (Small caveat: subsequent Parliament Acts did try to mitigate oppression, discrimination and corruption)"

But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they‚Äôre unexpectedly pulled into another world‚Äîone on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic‚Äîa way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.¬†

**Chapter 15: Warren Graves**

\-- --

Three weeks into their new life in Celdorne, and it had been nothing but acclimating ‚Äì the fantasy dream curdled into pure tedium. No adventures, no elf waifus, and definitely no freedom. Hell, they couldn‚Äôt even get time to leave the castle and explore!



All those grand expectations, subverted to hell and back. And here they were, getting steamrolled under the weight of cram sessions, like it was finals week all over again. If this wasn‚Äôt disillusionment, what was?



But finally, they‚Äôd been blessed with a glimmer of hope: an intermediate evaluation from a Slayer, dropping by unannounced. Cole hadn‚Äôt heard news until now, but apparently OTAC had finished their internal review and cleared them for integration. About damn time.



Word around the castle was that OTAC had found more mimics than expected during their sweep. Most happened to be in the lower ranks and the relatively unimportant logistics roles ‚Äì no offense to anyone in that field. Recruits, maintenance crews, haulers ‚Äì predictable targets: easy to infiltrate and often overlooked.



But some had wormed their way up the ladder. Some had served as Slayers for a few years now, and one had even managed to secure a Captain‚Äôs role. Nothing higher up, thank God, but still‚Ä¶ No wonder the review had taken forever.



Their evaluator was even more proof of just how serious OTAC was taking this. Built like the damn Hulk, there was something about the man that Cole couldn‚Äôt put his finger on. Most operators he knew carried a certain weight ‚Äì the shit they‚Äôd seen, the shit they‚Äôd *done* ‚Äì like a shadow that never left. But not this guy.



He didn‚Äôt seem weighed down by anything. His eyes weren‚Äôt hard or haunted, but steady. Like he‚Äôd made peace with it all. Like a pastor who‚Äôd traded his Bible for a sword and never looked back. No, that wasn‚Äôt right. More like‚Ä¶ a pastor who carried both Bible *and* sword ‚Äì and wielded them with the same conviction.



‚ÄúSir Warren Graves,‚Äù he introduced himself as he walked into the library, ‚ÄúSlayer Elite of the Office of Threat Assessment and Control. However, you may simply call me Graves. The Crown has chosen to place its faith in you. I am here to see that faith justified.‚Äù



Graves‚Ä¶ an interesting name, Cole had to admit. They stood up.



The man looked at each of them in turn. ‚ÄúLieutenant Mercer. Sergeant MacPherson. Sergeant Garrett. Sergeant Walker. I trust I‚Äôve not erred.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs us,‚Äù Cole said. Of course, their actual ranks ‚Äì Sergeant First Class, Sergeant Major, and Master Sergeant respectively ‚Äì meant something to them even if they‚Äôd taken to simplifying it for the locals.



Warren gave a simple nod. ‚ÄúPlease, be seated.‚Äù



As they sat back down, he walked over to a shelf and picked out a book. ‚ÄúLady Verna has prepared you as best she can,‚Äù Warren said, returning to them. ‚ÄúI shall witness your progress ere your induction among our number. We shall begin here before proceeding to the training hall.‚Äù



He opened to a marked page and set it before Miles. ‚ÄúSergeant Garrett. If you would read aloud the account of our kingdom‚Äôs founding.‚Äù



Miles took the book with a grimace. Cole fought back a smirk. All that bragging about editorials was about to bite him in the ass. Time to see if he was simply bullshitting, or if he was actually legit about his progress.



Miles cleared his throat and started reading. His Texan drawl did interesting things to the stuffy historical language:



‚ÄúThus did Alexander Celdor, in the Year Three Hundred and Three of the‚Ä¶ *Sundered* Era, having driven back the demons at great cost, establish our sovereign realm upon these‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes narrowed slightly, ‚Äú...verdant shores. For in his wisdom, gained through bitter contest against the infernal legions, he foresaw that the Istraynian Wastes would ever remain a wellspring of demonic corruption, from whence fresh horrors might emerge to plague mankind anew.‚Äù



Cole had to raise an eyebrow, reading over Miles‚Äô shoulder. So it seems he wasn‚Äôt just talking shit after all. He did have a couple rough patches here and there, but nothing that simple context clues couldn‚Äôt solve.



Then came his turn. Cole picked up where Miles left off. ‚ÄúWhereupon he gathered his most steadfast soldiers, those who had proven their worth against the Fourth Tide, and there upon the cliffs overlooking what would become Alexandria, he laid the foundation of our kingdom. ‚ÄòLet this land,‚Äô spoke he, ‚Äòstand as an eternal‚Ä¶ vigilance against the darkness. Not by strength of arms alone shall we prevail, but by the steadfast resolve of common men who choose to stand their ground.‚Äô‚Äù



Warren‚Äôs congratulation came in the form of just a nod ‚Äì passable. Not much, but it‚Äôd do. After just a day of Miles‚Äô smug ass waving those newspapers around while the rest of them were still stuck on kids‚Äô fairy tales, Cole had practically lived in the library. It was worth every minute of it now.



Ethan hadn't done too bad either. Probably got just as sick of Miles‚Äô newspaper routine as he had.



‚Äú‚ÄòI must here set down a truth most remarkable,‚Äô‚Äù Ethan read, ‚Äú‚Äòfor I have witnessed what learned men would scarce credit ‚Äì that our greatest victories were not won by those blessed with heaven‚Äôs gift, but by common men, who, when confronted with horrors beyond mortal ken, chose to stand fast though every fiber of their being cried out for flight.‚Äô‚Äù



Mack had shown them all up though ‚Äì caught up completely. Guess there wasn‚Äôt much else to do stuck in that infirmary bed besides read. He wrapped up the account from Alexander Celdor, even tossing in a bit of regal voice acting. ‚Äú‚ÄòThough a hero‚Äôs might may fell demons, it is the common soldier‚Äôs resolve ‚Äì to stand steadfast before terrors that should shatter any mortal‚Äôs spirit ‚Äì that truly turns the tide. For what demon can fathom such conviction? What force of hell can break the will of men who stand not for glory nor reward, nor even for their own survival, but because they know that if they do not, none shall?‚Äô‚Äù



If Warren was impressed, he didn‚Äôt show it. He simply moved on and pulled out several sheets of paper and placed them on the table. ‚ÄúSimple phrases. Market prices, travel directions, and the like. The essentials.‚Äù



Cole couldn‚Äôt be more ready. Neither could the others; even if they didn‚Äôt know the words, the language was essentially just English but with different letters. They‚Äôd gotten the sounds down, so they could pretty much write whatever Warren dictated.



‚ÄúA loaf of bread, twenty-five pence,‚Äù Warren began. ‚ÄúThe butcher‚Äôs rates for fresh mutton. One hundred fifty pence per pound.‚Äù



The quill felt awkward in Cole‚Äôs hand ‚Äì definitely hadn‚Äôt gotten used to that yet, but their pens wouldn‚Äôt last forever. Hadn‚Äôt gotten used to hearing shillings and pence either. Still, at least the currency was as intuitive as the quills. Simple, logical, easy to remember. A hundred pence made a shilling, and a hundred shillings made a crown.



Cole could‚Äôve sworn the British system used different ratios, but apparently Alexander Celdor had the right idea when he set things up. Would‚Äôve been easier if he‚Äôd just called them dollars and pennies, but hey, he‚Äôd take what he could get. Made a lot more sense than whatever the hell the Victorians did back then, anyway.



‚ÄúProceed from the Northern Gate, travel east along the river‚Äôs course until arriving at the mill. Cross at the stone bridge‚Ä¶‚Äù



Easy enough.¬†



‚ÄúIncident report,‚Äù Warren continued. ‚ÄúTime: 3PM. Location: Office of Threat Assessment and Control, Artifact Research. Nature of Report: Suspicious Persons. Details: Two subjects observed. One is male, approximately six feet, wearing dark cloak‚Ä¶‚Äù



Finally, Cole was done. He glanced at the others, who‚Äôd also finished, then back down at his paper. No spelling errors, hopefully.  
  


Warren scanned their work in about thirty seconds. Sure enough, no issues. ‚ÄúA proper grasp of our written word in mere weeks. Hm. Let us now see what progress Lady Verna‚Äôs instruction has wrought.‚Äù



Verna was already there when they walked in, and for once she wasn‚Äôt radiating sunshine and rainbows. She curtsied. ‚ÄúGood morning, Sir Warren.‚Äù



‚ÄúLady Verna,‚Äù he replied with a bow. ‚ÄúShall we begin?‚Äù



They ran through the whole curriculum: basic elements, barriers, strengthening magic, all topped off with simple spell combos. Nothing they hadn‚Äôt covered extensively over the past weeks.



Warren just watched. Didn‚Äôt say a word through any of it. When they finished, his attention shifted to Mack, who‚Äôd been standing off to the side.



‚ÄúSergeant MacPherson. Have you had the opportunity to study during your recovery?‚Äù



Cole frowned. Warren had to know Mack wasn‚Äôt completely stable yet. But here he was, prodding for a demonstration anyway.



‚ÄúJust theory, Sir Warren. But I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting on a show.‚Äù Mack read him like an open book, and apparently didn‚Äôt give a shit about intent. He readily accepted the unspoken challenge. ‚ÄúThese basic spells barely use any mana anyways.‚Äù



The surprise on Warren‚Äôs face lasted maybe half a second before morphing into amusement. ‚ÄúVery well. You may grace us with this ‚Äòshow‚Äô of yours.‚Äù



Mack stepped up as Verna raised an earthen dummy. This should be interesting; unlike the rest of them, he‚Äôd apparently been experimenting on his own time ‚Äì decided that their training sessions were just a starting point rather than a script to follow.



The mud formed exactly where he needed it, right under the target. Took them damn near half a day of drilling to get that kind of precision, and here was Mack pulling it off after what, maybe a cumulative hour of practice? The consistency shifted in real time too. It started liquid enough to move fast, thickening as it wrapped the target.



Mack must‚Äôve seen a shit ton of Animal Planet, because that mud shot up and struck like a boa constrictor going for the kill. Then, as soon as it wrapped around the target, it hardened. But for it to harden that fast? It couldn‚Äôt just be earth and water magic. No, he was channeling every traditional element they‚Äôd learned simultaneously ‚Äì fire, air, topped off with expert temperature control to transform that soft clay into something closer to ceramic in a split second.¬†



Miles whistled. ‚ÄúDamn. Now *that‚Äôs* some Avatar-level shit.‚Äù



Cole couldn‚Äôt agree more. Between Mack‚Äôs ability to pick up magic instantly and his willingness to actually experiment with it‚Ä¶ man. While they‚Äôd been following Verna‚Äôs curriculum to the letter, Mack had said fuck it and started pushing boundaries. Combining elements, testing interactions, seeing what these basic spells could actually do. Hell, they could‚Äôve done this too, if only they weren‚Äôt so stuck in training-wheels mode.



Having ensnared his target, Mack followed up with a basic fireball. He started just as Verna had taught: fire, air, and wrap it inside a barrier. So far, so standard. But then, he deviated from the script.¬†



Rock fragments ‚Äì pulled from the ground and pulverized into shrapnel ‚Äì began orbiting the contained flame. A second barrier formed around them, larger than the first. The front of both shells curved inward into a cone-shaped depression, while a small hole opened in the back.



Son of a bitch. Cole could recognize that move anywhere. It was straight out of their late-night yap session about modernizing Verna‚Äôs spell! Mack had actually taken their shop talk and turned it into something real while the rest of them were still playing by the book.



When the spell launched, it didn‚Äôt travel like their normal fireballs. It blitzed forward like a rocket, but Mack‚Äôs control kept it dead on target. It crossed the distance in an instant, striking center mass.



Unlike the rapid expansion of Verna‚Äôs thermobaric design, this was pure directed violence. The barriers ruptured simultaneously, turning their contained energy into a focused blast. It hit like a canister shot, spraying superheated fragments in a concentrated cone through the target. When the dust settled, the dummy was just‚Ä¶ gone. The stone wall behind it didn‚Äôt fare much better.



Even Warren‚Äôs stoic persona cracked a bit. His eyes widened just a fraction ‚Äì the equivalent of another man‚Äôs jaw hitting the floor. Verna had both hands over her mouth.



Ethan summed it up perfectly: ‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù



‚ÄúMacPherson, that is‚Ä¶ quite a recovery you‚Äôve made,‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúTake care not to overtax yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Mack laughed. He held up his hands, explaining himself in *unparalleled* humility. ‚ÄúStill healing. All that? Just basic spells; nothing Lady Verna hadn‚Äôt already taught us.‚Äù



Warren turned to Verna. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve taught them advanced combinations?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Verna shook her head, still staring at the wreckage. ‚ÄúWell, I did teach them the enhanced fireball ‚Äì how to integrate air for added force and preserve its power within a barrier. However, I shan‚Äôt take credit for the fragmentation, nor the curious shaping. I‚Äôve seen but hints of such designs in theoretical trials‚Ä¶ It seems that these are Sergeant MacPherson‚Äôs own innovations.‚Äù



‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Warren studied Mack again. ‚ÄúTell me, Sergeant, has your mana capacity been assessed yet? There‚Äôs no record of it in your dossier.‚Äù



‚ÄúSir Warren,‚Äù Verna interjected before Mack could respond. ‚ÄúThough his recovery has been most remarkable, the manameter would invite undue strain. He should avoid such exertion.‚Äù



‚ÄúA modest measurement shall suffice,‚Äù Warren pushed back. ‚ÄúOnly such as the Sergeant‚Äôs constitution can safely endure.‚Äù He glanced at Mack then at Cole.



Of course, Cole *could* order Mack to do it. But this wasn‚Äôt his decision to make, nor was it his field of expertise. He raised his eyebrows at Mack ‚Äì this was something for him to handle.



‚ÄúDr. Gracer and I discussed this, actually,‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been planning to do a baseline reading anyway, some way to measure recovery progress.‚Äù



Verna hesitated, but it seemed she trusted Mack enough. Or at least, trusted Elina‚Äôs trust in Mack. ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù she said with a sigh.



Warren led them to the testing chamber looking like some field commander who‚Äôd just been told his requisitions were finally coming through. Not quite smiling, but Cole could tell ‚Äì the man had dropped that pastor-like serenity from earlier. What had him so intrigued?



As they arrived at the testing room, Verna began instructing Mack. ‚ÄúStand at this line,‚Äù she said, gesturing to the 3-foot mark. ‚ÄúSimply form a barrier and direct only such measure of mana as you can safely control.‚Äù



The fluid in the manameter began to rise as soon as Mack started. Through the first bulb‚Ä¶ second‚Ä¶ fourth‚Ä¶ fifth. The moment Mack winced, he cut it off clean. Warren almost exposed his disappointment with a sigh, but even this partial measurement was exciting enough.



Level 15. Hyperphantasia permitting a natural talent with magic was one thing, but that kind of raw power on top of it? No wonder Warren was in heat. The Slayers had just found themselves a gold mine.



‚ÄúMost impressive,‚Äù Warren said. ‚ÄúAnd with conscious restraint, no? I should imagine Level 17, perhaps higher, at full capacity.‚Äù



Ethan chuckled. ‚ÄúDamn, doc. And here we thought *we* were hot shit hitting level 10.‚Äù



‚Äú‚ÄòHot shit,‚Äô Warren repeated. ‚ÄúVivid. Though raw power, while promising, is but the first step. We shall see what becomes of it, beginning on the morrow.‚Äù He addressed everyone, ‚ÄúReport to the library at 9 in the morning. We shall proceed to the Office‚Äôs grounds from there. Good day, gentlemen.‚Äù



Cole watched him go. It was hard not to feel a bit envious of Mack; seemed like everything came naturally to him, even mana capacity. *Especially* mana capacity. Visualization, he could do just as well, if not better.



But hell, after three weeks of being cooped up in the castle, Cole would take what he could get. At least tomorrow they‚Äôd finally see what Alexandria actually looked like beyond their window view.

Weekly review.,JohnElfedForexBlog,1i56q7r,2025-01-19 14:30:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnElfedForexBlog/comments/1i56q7r/weekly_review/,Johnelfed,,"The week starting Monday 13 January began with 'the market speculating' there would be no US rate cuts this year due to the strong US economy. From a trading point of view, another week of strong US data would have (likely) made the week a lot more straightforward, meaning we probably could have continued to long the USD all week.

But of course, trading is rarely straightforward. And US data throughout the week, (PPI, CPI and RETAIL SALES), all came in on the soft side. Remember all those months ago? (maybe even years ago), we were told the FED needs to see a softening of data to be comfortable cutting rates, this week it happened. And all of a sudden, 3 cuts are back on the table. 

Whilst this is good news in terms of a return of the 'soft landing risk on trades' which have served us so well. It does leave us in a bit of limbo currently as we await confirmation, ideally, US data will continue to remain slightly soft, and we'll see a continuation of this week's stocks up / yields down, 'risk on correlation', (a correlation we've not seen for a while). We can then confidently resume 'risk on' short JPY or CHF trades...possibly even short USD. 

Alternatively, if we see a resumption of strong US data, it won't be long before zero rate cuts are talked of again. And the USD will once again be the 'only long in town'. 

Throughout the week, the BOJ was bubbling under the surface, 'the market' currently thinks the BOJ will hike this coming week, hence the JPY strengthening despite to underlying positive market sentiment, which I believe skewed the currencies strength this week due to JPY liquidity. 

Regarding the BOJ meeting, I can envision two scenarios at the upcoming meeting, a 'dovish hike', or a 'hawkish hold'. My preference would be for a 'dovish hike' which, ultimately 'should hopefully' ignite a return of the 'short JPY' carry trade. Especially if the mild risk on environment continues and earnings season doesn't throw up any concerns. 

Sentiment for the GBP remains subdued, not helped by soft data, although every time it appeared the pound would seriously sell off, it found some resilience and rebounded, perhaps due to the 'mildy risk on' environment. 

On a personal note, it was a disappointing week, with two trades both stopping out. Although I stand by the logic of both trades, the GBP 'in the moment news trade' was perhaps a little rash as it was taken pre European open. The AUD CHF 'risk on' trade, whilst again, logically reasonable, it was perhaps a trade that could have been taken 24 hours earlier. It's also worth noting the trade stopped out at a 'gap' during market close, which is something I'm monitoring, particularly on CHF pairs. 

I begin the new week without a clear 'risk bias', although 'hopeful' risk on trades will soon be back en vouge. But I'm interested in the reaction to the 'Trump inauguration', the BOJ and S&P earnings season. 

Finally, following 4 days of no water at home, the supply is back on. Which is good news because I've discovered my beard has a lot more white in it than I ever would have cared to imagine.

**DWP failings left ex-pat in the dark about ¬£3,000 a year pension cut**

Mr Furnival, an 82-year-old British¬†pensioner¬†living in France, learned about the impending pension cut through a routine annual statement from the DWP in 2018. The statement revealed that his Adult Dependency Increase (ADI) payments - a supplement provided to households where the main earner had reached state pension age but their partner had not - would cease in 2020.

People who lived in the UK had been told about the change to ADI payments eight years earlier in 2010.

He complained to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). The Ombudsman found that the DWP had ‚Äòfailed to properly communicate the changes‚Äô and ‚Äòfailed to respond to his initial queries and complaints in a timely way‚Äô.

The Ombudsman recommended that DWP apologise and pay Adrian ¬£675 for the injustice he suffered. The DWP has complied with this.

The Ombudsman also recommended that the DWP should also provide a comparable remedy to anyone who approaches the Department in a similar situation.

**Oral evidence regarding Safeguarding Vulnerable Claimants heard this week**

This week the Work and Pensions Committee¬†heard further oral evidence from a variety of witnesses on the Safeguarding Vulnerable Claimants. Chief medical Adviser for the DWP, Dr. Gail Allsopp gave evidence explaining her clinical governance role within the DWP, specifically in relation to disability benefits.

When asked (question 25) if she was ‚Äòconfident that the health assessors are up to speed with what they need to know?‚Äô Dr. Allsopp confirmed in relation to safeguarding training that:

>‚ÄúWe¬†will¬†give the providers 12 months, in the same way we would in the NHS, for people to come up to speed.¬†At the moment¬†everybody will be level 2 trained, but by the end of this year they will be level 3 trained.

>We have developed a new digital dashboard, so¬†all of¬†the training will be monitored. We will be able to see compliance and track that in the monthly meetings that we have with the providers.‚Äù

In relation to prevention of future death reports Dr. Allsopp said:

>‚ÄúFinding trends out of prevention of future death reports is difficult with the low numbers that come through. However, as part of the clinical governance review, I set up a new clinical governance board. It is chaired by a non-executive director of¬†DWP¬†and it feeds into the governance structures.¬†

>We have tabled this month‚Ä¶ on our clinical governance board a summary of the prevention of future death reports that have come in over the last year where we will look to see if there are any trends identified. One of the decisions the board will be asked to make is how often we want those prevention of future death reports brought. The board sits every three months.‚Äù

When pressed to confirm ‚Äòhow many is very few?‚Äô Dr. Allsopp confirmed that there have been 5 in 16 months.

**Scotland ‚Äì carers or disabled people moving to Scotland will have to make a new application to SSS**

The Cabinet Secretary, Shirley-Anne Sommerville has written to the Scottish Commission on Social Security setting out the draft regulations ‚Äì the Social Security (Cross-border Provision, Case Transfer and Miscellaneous¬† Amendment) (Scotland) Regulations 2025

These draft regulations make changes to the regulations for Child Disability Payment, Adult Disability Payment, Pension Age Disability Payment and Carer Support Payment so that people moving from the rest of the UK to Scotland who have been in receipt of a corresponding DWP benefit (DLA, PIP, AA, CA) will need to make a new application to Social Security Scotland - rather than be automatically switched over via the current determination without application process.

Ms. Sommerville advises that ‚ÄòWe plan for the regulations to come into force in September 2025. Changes to PADP and Scottish Adult DLA will come into force later if required to take account of the different end dates of case transfer.‚Äô

**Case law ‚Äì with thanks to u\\ClareTGold**

Two important High Court decisions this week on unlawful DWP actions so we‚Äôve dedicated some extra room‚Ä¶

¬†



**DWP WCA consultation was ‚Äòmisleading‚Äô, ‚Äòrushed‚Äô and ‚Äòunfair‚Äô says High Court as it confirms it was unlawful**

The consultation was held in 2023 on proposed changes to the¬†[work capability assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/work-capability-assessment-activities-and-descriptors)¬†(WCA).

The DWP uses the WCA¬†to evaluate whether Disabled people are eligible for the extra health component of Universal Credit or Employment Support Allowance and have restricted work conditionality. ¬†

The¬†Public Law Project¬†acting for Clifford, argued that the consultation was unlawful for several reasons, including that:¬†

* It did not explain properly that many people would receive significantly less money if impacted by the reforms, and start being required to meet conditions (or, in some cases, meet more stringent conditions) in order to receive their payments, with a risk of sanctions if they did not meet them.¬†
* The true or primary motive behind the consultation was to reduce spending on disability benefits, which was not disclosed. The consultation papers had presented the proposals as being about helping people to move into or closer to the labour market, without providing any evidence at all to explain how this purported aim would be met.¬†¬†
* A consultation that ran for just under 8 weeks was too short, given the importance of the proposals and the additional time that Deaf and Disabled people and their organisations need to engage meaningfully in this context.¬†

Over the course of the judicial review, internal DWP documents revealed that:¬†

* The DWP had not done any employment, equality or disability assessment on the impact of the proposals prior to the consultation being launched, though civil servants had identified that almost 100,000 people could move into poverty, based on certain internal estimates. The equality impact assessment that was completed after the consultation was launched remains unpublished.¬†
* Civil servants were aware that the proposals would have a particularly strong impact on those with preexisting significant mental health conditions and suicidal ideation, and that the ‚Äúreduction in income alone might be a bigger contributory factor to a deterioration in mental health than undertaking work preparatory activity‚Äù.¬†
* Civil servants made proposals to ministers on what changes to consult on based on the fiscal impact, with the emphasis being on scorable savings that could be announced for the Autumn Statement 2023. Internal documents recorded for example, that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the Prime Minister indicated that the DWP should consult on reforms to the WCA gateway in time to score them for the Autumn Statement‚Ä¶‚Äù ¬†
* The DWP was also aware that the proposals would be controversial and that there was a risk they‚Äôd be ‚Äúperceived as purely cost-saving measures by influential disability rights groups, individual stakeholders and by SSAC‚Äù, leading to recommendations that ‚Äúa wider narrative based on modern and home working‚Äù was also developed.
* Internal documents demonstrate that the Secretary of State considered including particular proposals as part of the consultation, notwithstanding that they would not¬†lead to savings, solely because this could be ‚Äúuseful‚Äù to support a narrative that the motivation for consultation was about the importance of getting more people into work and not saving money.¬†¬†

In his judgment, Mr. Justice Calver found that the consultation [was ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù, ‚Äúrushed‚Äù and ‚Äúunfair‚Äù:¬†]()

* The consultation documents were misleading for failing to highlight the ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù loss of benefit payments that those impacted by the proposals would face and created a ‚Äúmisleading impression‚Äù that changes were required to ensure certain Deaf and Disabled People could access employment support. In reality, the changes were about¬†*compelling*¬†them to access this support, which they could already choose to access voluntarily. Mr. Justice Calver described this as a ‚Äúfalse rationale‚Äù, relied upon by DWP in its consultation.¬†¬†
* The evidence before him strongly supported the conclusion that ‚Äúcosts savings was at least one of the two bases, if not¬†*the*¬†central basis, on which decisions would be taken on which policies would be taken forward by the Government.‚Äù¬† In the circumstances, the judge considered that the SSWP ‚Äúought in fairness to have made clear that AME cost savings were, together with work inactivity, the rationale for the proposals‚Äù and that ‚Äúdisclosure of this highly relevant fact, was required‚Äù.¬†¬†
* A consultation that ran for just under eight weeks was unlawfully short in the circumstances, given the importance of the matters under consultation, the fact that DWP had already announced a significant consultation on the Disability Action Plan and the lack of any prior notice that SSWP wanted to consult on proposals of this nature, which was unexpected given the very recently published Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper.
* Mr Justice Calver observed:¬†*‚Äú*The unfair burden upon vulnerable people of having to deal with a yet further consultation process at this time at such short notice cannot be overstated"" and in setting the consultation period, the Defendant ought to have had more regard to the attributes of those people who would be affected by these proposals. These were proposals which, in particular, could potentially drive vulnerable people into poverty as well as adversely affecting disabled people and substantial risk claimants who have mental health conditions and suicide ideation.‚Äù¬†

Ellen Clifford said:¬†

>‚ÄúThrough this judicial review, it became clear that there was a complete disregard for equality or disability impacts in this consultation process. No disability or equality impacts, or even employment outcomes, were evaluated before or during the consultation. We now know that an equality impact assessment was produced, but it remains unpublished.

>The DWP did calculate cost savings, however, confirming what many disabled people feared: that cuts to disability benefits had been prioritised over lives. However, DWP chose not to admit this as part of the consultation.

>Instead, we now know that civil servants and ministers were making desperate attempts to ‚Äòfind‚Äô a rationale for the cuts, which they thought would be less controversial, and even considered consulting on particular proposals that would have generated negligible savings, to make it appear as though saving money was not their primary motive. It is heartening that Mr Justice Calver agreed with us that this is ‚Äòback to front policy making‚Äô.

>The lack of transparency in this consultation was overwhelming and I am relieved that the judge has recognised that this is not the right way to engage the Disabled community.‚Äù

She added:

>‚ÄúBut the crucial question is what lessons the Government should learn from this case. Measures to help the economy should not require the impoverishment and suffering of hundreds of thousands of Disabled people. Such¬†measures would simply represent a false economy in that they will substantially increase pressures on public services such as the NHS and lead to higher spending in other areas.¬†

>DWP‚Äôs own civil servants acknowledged this internally when they recognised that the proposed reduction in income for people with significant mental health conditions and suicidal ideation could contribute to further deterioration in their mental health.

>That is why we are calling for these harmful reforms to the work capability assessment to be dropped.‚Äù¬†

The High Court ruled that the DWP acted unlawfully by presenting controversial benefit assessment reforms as a way to support disabled people into work, without making clear that the proposals also included ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù cuts to disability benefits and that cost savings was a ‚Äúprimary rationale‚Äù for the proposals. ¬†

It also found that the consultation failed to explain that planned reforms would lead to around 450,000 Disabled people receiving lower benefit rates and that many would be worse off by at least ¬£416.19 per month and was unlawfully short given the circumstances.¬†

The High Court‚Äôs judgement in¬†[R (on the application of Ellen Clifford) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions¬†](https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/r-v-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions/)is available from judiciary.uk.

**High Court rules UC rent deduction scheme is (also) unlawful**

In early 2024, the Department for Work and Pensions paid more than five hundred pounds of Nathan Roberts‚Äô Universal Credit (UC) to his landlord. This took him completely by surprise.

Mr Roberts‚Äô landlord had asked DWP to make those benefit deductions, saying Mr Roberts was in rent arrears. DWP decided to make deductions, assuming it would be in Mr Roberts‚Äô interests to do so, without ever telling Mr Roberts about the application or asking him what he thought about it. That was not some unusual accident: it was the government‚Äôs deliberate policy. DWP makes perhaps hundreds of thousands of deductions from Universal Credit per year without checking with the affected benefit claimant first.

Mr Roberts strongly opposed deductions; he did not agree that he owed his landlord any money; and he was about to move out. He wrote repeatedly to DWP to tell them this, but for months they did nothing. He sent two pre-action letters threatening judicial review, and they still did nothing. DWP did not refund the deductions until after Mr Roberts made his judicial review claim.

The High Court has decided that fairness requires a claimant to know about a deductions application, and be allowed to tell DWP their views on it, before deductions are put into effect.

Note also that while this case concerned rent deductions, it is easy to see how a claimant could argue that the principle of allowing pre-deduction representations should logically apply to other kinds of UC deductions, such as for water or fuel charges.

An important and novel feature of the¬†Roberts¬†judgment is that it helps show how to scrutinise the lawfulness of automated, or semi-automated, decision making. It has lessons for claimants and defendants in public law litigation.

The Court holds that DWP‚Äôs policy is to ‚Äòdirect her decision makers that it is unnecessary to give UC claimants an opportunity to make representations before making payments to landlords‚Äô. It comes to that conclusion even though there is no policy document stating in terms that DWP staff need not contact claimants before making deductions decisions. However, deductions decision makers are told by a computer programme to input certain information, and they are told at the end what the outcome should be. Even if in theory the decision maker could unplug the computer and exercise their own discretion, the reality is that its instructions will be followed. The computer program is in effect a highly directive policy.

A lesson for claimants is that it may be necessary to seek disclosure of information which is not ordinarily sought in judicial review: the key information may lie in the way a computer has been programmed, and therefore may not be visible in the way that other policies are.

A lesson for defendants is that when the policy is a computer program, that may make it unhelpfully (and potentially unlawfully) opaque not just to external observers, but even to the ministers and civil servants responsible for it. In the¬†Roberts¬†case, DWP had to repeatedly correct its own evidence about what the deductions process actually was.

Having failed to provide any information at all in the pre-action stage of proceedings, the account of the policy provided in DWP‚Äôs summary defence contained a significant omission (which the High Court described as ‚Äòparticularly chilling‚Äô given that the Defendant was at that stage arguing that the claim should not even be examined at a full hearing: ‚Äòpermission could have been refused by a Court being denied relevant information‚Äô). DWP made a second attempt to explain its policy in its detailed grounds of defence and witness evidence, apologising for its earlier omission. It then provided a third account shortly before the hearing, having apparently realised that some of what it had said in its second account was still mistaken. During the hearing, the operation of its policy was, remarkably, still unclear (*‚Äò‚Ä¶* On that crossover point, I was given two different answers during the two-day hearing‚Ä¶‚Äô). DWP had to provide a¬†fourth¬†account after the hearing finished.

The High Court determined that the policy on making deductions from benefit claimants‚Äô UC is unlawful because at present the scheme unfairly prevents claimants from making representations, before deductions start, about whether deductions should actually be taken from their benefit for alleged rent arrears.

To comply with the Court‚Äôs decision DWP will have to give UC claimants a say on whether deductions of this kind should be made, before making deductions.
