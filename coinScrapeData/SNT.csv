A Semi-Comprehensive List of Boss Jank in Elden Ring (feel free to suggest more),onebros,1i5qzvx,2025-01-20 09:11:52,49,0.92,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/a_semicomprehensive_list_of_boss_jank_in_elden/,flingsmashswit2,Discussion,"Made this list for posterity’s sake. Most of these points are just minor annoyances that barely detract from what are otherwise great bosses, but are still flaws nonetheless and would be patched out in an ideal scenario. Though I wasn’t able to cite my sources for everything, I still tried to link as many as I could.

**Disclaimer #1**: there’s a lot of points here that came from my own intuition throughout my RL1 run so I’m not 100% sure on everything. If I say something that’s incorrect in any way please point it out to me so I can fix it, spreading misinformation is the last thing I want to do. Additionally, if there’s any jank that wasn’t mentioned here then feel free to let me know in the comments, I will make sure to update the list with y’alls suggestions. **Disclaimer #2**: a few of these points are less so ""jank"" and moreso annoying things that, while working as intended, are pretty irritating so I want to spend the time to suggest ways of circumventing them here to help others (e.g. Rellana's uppercut). **Disclaimer #3**: take a shot everytime I say “terrain” or “camera”.

**Tree Sentinel**

* The aftershock AOEs of his shield attacks have inaccurate hitboxes (they are a lot larger than they seem)
* (Limgrave only) The elevation from the terrain fucks with his tracking

**Margit**

* No issues found

**Godrick**

* His walking flamethrower attack can sometimes persist behind him (particularly if he’s on the stairs), which can make the strafe method of dodging this move very inconsistent
* The stairs can make jump and low-profile dodges inconsistent, as well as ripostes

**Red Wolf of Radagon**

* Can frame-trap (?) you if his Glintblades activate during his melee bite/lunge attacks, especially when you’re up against a wall

**Rennala**

* Early chandelier hitboxes (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1ackome/what\_hit\_me\_rennala/)
* A student can randomly fall on your head without any telegraph
* Staggers are a bit inconsistent: sometimes she does absolutely nothing after a stagger and other times she doesn’t even hesitate to use her hyper-armor hop attack that lacks a tell, kinda like a proto-Malenia

**Starscourge Radahn**

* Collapsing Stars can be a frame trap if his jump attack is done from mid-range (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj6ra3PJI1U)
* The Shockwave can hit you if you are underneath him and can even be invisible (source: https://www.twitch.tv/lupineos/clip/RefinedHeadstrongSpaghettiDuDudu-VnOhIAMEmhTWujUi?filter=clips&range=30d&sort=time)
* Shockwaves can get hung up on terrain and frozen in place

**Godskin Apostle**

* The quick double swipe can easily roll-catch in neutral (applies to both medium and light roll) due to its speed and range and is especially hard to react to due to the windup animation’s looking very similar to a few of his other attacks, although the first swipe can potentially be low-profiled to make dodging the second swipe easier but I’m not so sure on the consistency

**Godskin Noble**

* If stance-broken or put to sleep during his roll attack, he can immediately continue the roll animation after his wake-up animation from the riposte/sleep

**Rykard**

* The Phase 1 earthquake attack, while not impossible to avoid by sprinting to the left and jumping the moment it happens, does have very tight window due to the insane hitbox and tracking
* The Skull Storm can obscure the attacks he’s doing in the meantime

**Draconic Tree Sentinel**

* No issues found

**Mohg the Omen**

* Can be locked out of certain attacks when too close to the fog gate, which breaks his AI (check 0:35 in https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingBuilds/comments/1h65l72/allhit\_both\_moghs\_no\_guard\_no\_dodge\_no\_healing/)

**Goldfrey**

* Can sometimes do a 540 axe spin instead of a 360 axe spin but this is moreso the result of you overstrafing than actual jank (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/comment/m86twt5/?context=3)

**Morgott**

* No issues found

**Regal Ancestor Spirit**

* Can commit suicide after teleporting (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_ylLGO0TzKs&ab\_channel=MiguelMartinetti)
* Goat roll has an inaccurate hitbox (source: [https://www.twitch.tv/lupineos/clip/PerfectDeadAirGuitarThisIsSparta-VtS5tVftKhgdwYtY](https://www.twitch.tv/lupineos/clip/PerfectDeadAirGuitarThisIsSparta-VtS5tVftKhgdwYtY) ) 

**Valiant Gargoyles**

* Inconsistent aggression, especially with the Twinblade Gargoyle once it spawns in (either walks slowly and passively towards you or divebombs right at you immediately)
* Potential frame traps when both are aggressive, e.g. when both use their divebomb moves simultaneously (can happen at range too)
* Can get stuck on the cliffs when flying away
* Ripostes can be prevented if they’re stance broken on the rocks due to the elevation lifting the riposte hurtbox super high
* Camera jank at close-range
* The Poison AOE

**Astel**

* Inaccurate grab hitbox (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/uvfrj9/astels\_atrocious\_grab\_hitbox\_this\_has\_got\_to\_be/)
* The direction of the meteors are quite RNG-heavy but this isn’t a huge issue if you just spam roll through it

**Fia’s Champions**

* Phase 3 relies on RNG to an unprecedented extent

**Lichdragon Fortissax**

* Inconsistent leg hurtbox (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1e8lufy/hitbox\_on\_hindlegs\_of\_fortissax\_are\_absolutely/)
* No hitbox on his body during the divebomb attack, only the legs (shameless plug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrb3xCcZLM4&t=128)
* Strange Deathblight hitbox (another shameless plug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDU1hPSyN60)

**Commander Niall**

* Can get frame-trapped by Niall after riposting one of his Banished Knight spirits
* The Shielded Banished Knight has inconsistent parry hitboxes (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=955EVORcwP8&ab\_channel=Fracture42), and the same goes for Niall if you are on his right during his stabs (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjTd4iJEzi0&ab\_channel=Fracture42)
* Can use his big ice slash move immediately after the wake-up animation from a riposte (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5xeqv/why\_should\_i\_do\_a\_big\_wind\_up\_when\_i\_can\_just\_do/)
* His neutral frost stomp can easily roll-catch you on medium roll due to the lingering hitbox, though rolling into it does seem to make the timing a bit more forgiving

**Fire Giant**

* Avalanche plate sweep can be incredibly difficult to jump over on Torrent, though you can always just use the dismounting i-frames to avoid it completely
* The rocky terrain can elevate his left leg during Phase 1 to prevent you from attacking it
* Can get completely stuck in the terrain during Phase 2 (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F8CWev3jHc&t=528)
* The Flame Pillars can persist into Phase 2 if the phase transition is triggered before they dissipate (shameless plug: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1h4ttil/can\_you\_feel\_that\_light\_inside\_can\_you\_feel\_that/)
* The Fire Breath can go in incredibly unpredictable directions if it collides with the rocks or tree stumps (source: https://youtu.be/ORPotO4k4j0?si=FUadIDGD6Z5EZplC&t=1144)

**Mohg Lord of Blood**

* If he jumps back into a wall or tombstone during his flying attack he will throw the Bloodflame behind you, which is really annoying considering that it’s the direction you should typically roll into when dealing with this attack (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jswuSNtIjWo)
* If he swings over a tombstone he will alter his swing arc in order to elevate the hitbox (which will definitely hit you if you’re doing a jump or strafe dodge)
* The Bloodflame can drop in weird unpredictable places after colliding with the tombstones and urns
* Can get stuck in the tombstones, which freaks out his AI and pressures him into throwing Bloodflame everywhere
* His descent from the flying attack can get him stuck in the tombstones, causing him to not travel and instead come directly down along the thing, which can be quite a surprise especially if he does his spear-thrust-to-explosion move quickly after (source: https://reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/a\_semicomprehensive\_list\_of\_boss\_jank\_in\_elden/m86asc3/?context=3)
* The stairs can make low-profile and jump dodges inconsistent, as well as preventing ripostes and, you guessed it, fucking with the direction of his Bloodflame

**Loretta**

* No issues found

**Malenia**

* Inconsistent hyper-armor: her hyper-armor frames from one attack can linger and overlap with the startup of another hyper-armor attack, causing her to both tank your punish and hit you thereafter (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ky53T5IOSE)
* Can continue her combo even after you stagger her, although this seems to be a problem exclusive to lighter weapons for the most part (source: https://www.reddit.com/user/Ruindows/comments/1i5xxer/weird\_malenia\_behavior/)
* Inconsistent aggro during Phase 1, sometimes stays passive even if you hit her during neutral
* Tracking issues: she can attack facing away from you or dash in a circle right at you and dead angle attacks while turning them at you
* The slopes on the terrain can majorly fuck with dodging some of her attacks via making them end weirdly early (e.g. the Thrust and the Uppercut Slam) (source: check 0:23 in https://www.reddit.com/user/Ruindows/comments/1i5xxer/weird\_malenia\_behavior/)
* Unlocks Waterfowl at 75% HP but her frequency of using it is incredibly inconsistent: sometimes she can chain it into another Waterfowl the moment she unlocks it and other times she never even uses it at all, apparently it’s meant to have cooldown but I’ve seen her do it twice in a row (I’ve heard that the cooldown can be bypassed if she dodges a ranged attack but this needs further citation)
* Her phase transition cannot be triggered by a riposte or status proc, she will stay at 0HP until you whack her one more time
* Her Phase 2 wings can block her sword when standing behind her, which makes reacting to her attacks from behind needlessly difficult (her body movements also have tells but they’re a lot more tricky to intuit compared to her sword swings due to their subtlety)
* Gains the Counter-Kick during Phase 2 to punish hitting her with a second attack but its occurrence is pretty inconsistent

**Godskin Duo**

* Incredibly unpredictable aggression at long-range, sometimes they do jackshit and other times they spam fireballs like there’s no tomorrow (especially the Apostle)
* The Apostle’s jump attack hitbox goes through the pillars
* The stairs can prevent ripostes (shameless plug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFTRsGxEOJ8&t=62s)
* Can get frame-trapped by the other Godskin after riposting their buddy
* The Noble can cancel his roll attack mid-animation into a fireball throw before canceling right back into the roll like nothing ever happened (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/xa19uj/weird\_godskin\_noble\_glitch\_in\_the\_duo\_fight\_of/)
* The Noble’s roll attack can sometimes go over or around the pillars instead of getting stuck on them

**Maliketh**

* The Ground Rupture can persist into Phase 2 if the phase transition is triggered before the boulders fall
* The player can end up in a different starting position during the Phase 2 opening, especially when the phase transition is triggered during a riposte
* Finicky hurtboxes, particularly when using fist weapons (not really jank just a common sentiment I’ve heard)
* Sometimes projectiles go straight through him in Phase 1, mainly because his robe doesn't have a hurtbox (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/comment/m864cgt/?context=3)
* His blade beams can phase through the pillars
* Maliketh himself can get stuck in the pillars (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/11l50w4/maliketh\_stuck\_in\_a\_pillar/)

**Dragonlord Placidusax**

* Traveling Thundercloud Form (i.e. his second flying thundercloud attack) and his downward Lightning Claw slam have questionable lingering hitboxes, particularly the Lightning Claw if you roll into it
* For Traveling Thundercloud Form: I recommend locking off, running to a wall and late-dodging away from him at the last moment of the attack. As for the Lightning Claw, it can definitely be dodged into but the timing is very tight so if you're not comfortable with doing so I recommend just dodging away.
* The butt slam he does after his fire spewing move has a far larger hitbox than the animation communicates, you can even get hit by it at his non-moving legs (source: https://reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/a\_semicomprehensive\_list\_of\_boss\_jank\_in\_elden/m86a2yu/?context=3)
* When he jumps away to reposition he has a hitbox on his body (source https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/comment/m881puc/), which is pretty rare and not really jank but should be mentioned nonetheless to prevent any surprise deaths

**Gideon**

* Exists

**Godfrey / Hoarah Loux**

* The Fissure AOE can persist into Phase 2 if the phase transition is triggered before the attack is finished
* The player can end up in a different starting position during the Phase 2 opening, especially when the phase transition is triggered during a riposte
* Inaccurate grab hitboxes (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1azpyvz/i\_think\_i\_hate\_godfrey\_more\_than\_godskin\_duo/)

**Radagon**

* No issues found

**Elden Beast**

* Wave of Gold is nigh-impossible to dodge at mid-range with medium roll (here's the light roll dodge method: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/11uwuau/comment/jcqq2yu/)
* The invisible walls can make sprint dodging his attacks (e.g. Concept of Order, the Golden Pillar and Elden Stars) needlessly stressful
* The four-hit Flaming Sword Beam combo can easily frame-trap you when riding Torrent at mid-or-long-range, although I have managed to dodge it mounted once but by complete accident (shameless plug: https://youtu.be/534yYMsXVPo?si=VWoDbg4QIp7jZWnV&t=280), never been able to replicate it yet
* His tracking projectiles (e.g. Elden Stars and the Golden Pillars) can visually block the attacks he’s doing in the meantime

**Divine Beast Dancing Lion**

* Camera jank (especially when right in his face or up against a wall)
* The quick bite attack is incredibly hard to react to due to its speed and the wind-up animation’s visual similarities with both his idle animation and one of his delayed roll-catch moves
* Inconsistent breath tracking, particularly during the Lightning phase
* Sometimes doesn’t follow-up with his positional combo extensions even when you’re right in front of him, instead opting to stare into your soul
* The lightning AOEs can be consistently dodged due to the predictable timing but the positioning is RNG-heavy

**Rellana**

* Her left-arm uppercut is absurdly quick with a tell that’s difficult to distinguish from her other attacks (although it can be low-profiled with either a crouch or the recovery animation of a charged/jumping R2 if you’re in front of her so it isn’t unbearable)
* No hitbox at the front of her five-hit magic beam attack (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKtAZPm1yw4&t=103)

**Putrescent Knight**

* The horse’s roar lingers enough to easily roll-catch, which is on top of already being hard to react to due to having an incredibly subtle tell (**Update: the hitbox comes out later than the animation tells you so it won't roll-catch if you roll a bit later, source: https://www.reddit.com/user/Ruindows/comments/1g1dry9/some\_putrescent\_knight\_hitboxes/)**
* When he does horse combo near a wall, the horse may not charge the first time or the horse will come through the wall with less visual clarity (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/comment/m863tsa/?context=3)
* The final two attacks of horse combo can overlap, although this is a pretty rare occasion
* The sloping parts of the terrain can make jump dodges incredibly inconsistent, particularly with the boomerang attack

**Golden Hippo**

* Camera jank (especially when close to him or up against a wall)
* His head can phase through the wall after a stance-break which completely prevents a riposte
* The quill rain is incredibly RNG-heavy due to the sheer randomness of where the quills land (**Update: only the positioning is RNG, the timing is consistent. Waiting half a beat then rolling twice will dodge both hitboxes that appear. Source: https://reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/a\_semicomprehensive\_list\_of\_boss\_jank\_in\_elden/m8d8g1i/?context=3)**
* Quill rain dodge method: you can use the entrance as cover from it (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_UVcWozPclc&ab\_channel=Fracture42)
* The quill spin attack is undodgeable if you’re cornered to a wall: you need to sprint then jump to the right to outspace it, which is impossible if there’s a wall blocking the direction you’re meant to sprint into (this is especially difficult on medium roll)
* There is deep water in the arena that prevents you from sprint jumping (source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrvL266xaOI&ab\_channel=Fracture42)

**Commander Gaius**

* The boar charge has an absurdly large hitbox (source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1e1dil2/commander\_gaius\_charge\_kick\_and\_sword\_hitboxes/)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1e1dil2/commander_gaius_charge_kick_and_sword_hitboxes/), which is especially annoying to dodge with medium roll
* The boar charge hitbox is so massive and lasts for so long that the game sometimes thinks that you’ve been hit by it twice, therefore making it deal double the amount of damage than usual
* Can whip out the boar charge at point-blank
* Most consistent boar charge dodge I've found: [https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dys3zg/easy\_commander\_gaius\_charge\_dodge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dys3zg/easy_commander_gaius_charge_dodge/)
* Weirdly fucked up tracking: he can head bash you from behind and kick you when in front (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XazdgdM3irQ&ab\_channel=MouseInATutu)
* Lock-on frequently breaks due to the objects in the arena

**Scadutree Avatar**

* If Phase 1 or 2 is finished with a riposte inflicted after stance-break, he will die before you can get the end-phase riposte and will respawn in the next phase with max health
* Can use his long-range attacks at point-blank (e.g. Impenetrable Thorns) where they are far more difficult to dodge
* The Thorns can collide with the sloped terrain and explode under you, resulting in a frame-trap
* The arena can cause input drops (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwKn67Q458&ab\_channel=MouseInATutu)
* Can sometimes spawn behind you during its respawn animation, which can make dodging and punishing his Phase 2 and 3 opening attack weirdly inconsistent

**Messmer**

* The player can end up in a different starting position during the Phase 2 opening, especially when the phase transition is triggered during a riposte
* The snake flurry scream is undodgeable when up against a wall

**Romina**

* Sometimes doesn’t follow-up with her positional combo extensions even when you’re right in front of her (most notably the second part of her close-range double spear swing)
* Instant AOE that’s impossible to dodge at point-blank (although you can make the non-Phase-Transition variants less likely to happen by staying close to her side, it’s often used as a punish for staying in front of or behind her)
* Strange centipede hitboxes, particularly the lack thereof (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1ft7x00/so\_you\_can\_strafe\_this\_move\_of\_romina\_is\_there/)
* The centipede spin move has a late hitbox so you can just pass through them before they can hit you (source: 0:54 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z6hRTMULBk&ab\_channel=BigYig)

**Jori**

* The spot he teleports to is complete RNG and can result in some incredibly frustrating runs if he ends up in a shitty place (e.g. between the tombstones or the other side of the arena)
* The slopes and tombstones can result in you, Jori and the summons getting stuck in between shitass places, which increases the likelihood of you getting ganked the fuck out
* Spawns off-camera summons behind you while you are stuck in the terrain

**Midra**

* His flame trail can ghost proc madness build-up during your i-frames (source: check 0:42 in https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1enpzt6/is\_an\_elderly\_person\_you\_know\_trapped\_in\_an/)
* Sprinting away from the phase transition can be needlessly stressful if you’re up against a wall, though it can never completely frame-trap you from what I’ve seen
* The phase transition’s aftershock particles can conceal his follow-up attack, which is especially dangerous if he uses the chaos beam that blends in with color scheme (although it can still be reacted to if you hear out for the audio cue but this is pretty difficult since it can be obscured by louder sounds, e.g. the OST)

**Ancient Dragon-Man**

* His roll-into-great-katana-R1 combo is frame-perfect and unreactable (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb9ApUfOVz0)
* Absurd input reading: he consistently punishes long-range inputs with an L2 and close-range inputs with a jump dodge followed by a jump attack
* Wonky terrain due to the multitude of rocks and slopes, which is only exacerbated by the claustrophobic arena 

**Bayle**

* His fire breath has wonky physics: it can bounce off of the non-flat terrain and walls, making it go in incredibly unpredictable directions as a result (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1fj2k35/average\_bayle\_death\_lmao\_one\_of\_my\_favourite/) (shameless plug: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i3eybl/\_/)
* The fire breath also has weirdly inconsistent tracking (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1fg6dtr/this\_move\_is\_making\_me\_hate\_bayle/)
* Camera jank when standing at the side of his head
* Can use his ranged attacks at close-range (e.g. the fire breath) and use his melee attacks at long-range (e.g. the wing swipes)
* Sometimes forgets to follow-up on his lunging bite combo even when you’re in front of him
* The tracking lightning from his roar can obscure his next attack if he’s standing right behind them
* Lock-on frequently breaks during the sprint-the-fire-blasts section of his phase transition move
* Can get stupidly hit by the RNG lightning blasts during the sprint-the-fire-blasts section of his phase transition move (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1e7sg96/bayle\_shenanigans/)

**Metyr**

* Frequently forgets to follow-up on her combos (e.g. the triple head slam and the triple arm slam just abruptly ending before their respective third slams, and in the triple head slam’s case even the second slam doesn’t come out sometimes)
* The triple arm slam can sometimes be followed-up by an immediate fourth arm slam, which rarely ever happens but is a weird occurrence nonetheless
* Weirdly fucked up tracking: can use her sideways finger shove/crawl when you’re right in front of her
* Can get frame-trapped in her body if you roll into her during the landing part of the finger-spraying leap attack
* Her adds can spawn in before her summoning animation is even finished
* Can use a second move during Fleeting Microcosms, which can result in frame-traps if you’re stuck between the Microcosms
* The Beyblade attack has a questionable lingering hitbox (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1hrpftt/can\_someone\_with\_a\_phd\_in\_elden\_ring\_explain\_what/)
* The first Black Hole Laser is undodgeable at point-blank without an i-frame Ash of War due to the knockback vortex and the thickness of the laser beam
* The invisible walls can make sprint dodging her moves (e.g. long-range Black Hole Laser dodge) needlessly stressful
* When she jumps away to reposition she has a hitbox on her body (source https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/comment/m881puc/), which is pretty rare and not really jank (like Placidusax's) but should be mentioned nonetheless to prevent any surprise deaths

**Consort Radahn**

* ~~The Cross-Slash is a near-guaranteed frame-trap unless you dodge to the left with perfect timing on the flat terrain~~ (fixed)
* ~~The aftershock effect of the Bloodflame Slash obscures his next move~~ (fixed)
* Forgets to do the final left-side swipe attack of his six-hit slash combo even when you’re right in front of him, though you can increase the likelihood of him using it through staying closer to his right side as opposed to being right in front of him (source: https://reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qzvx/a\_semicomprehensive\_list\_of\_boss\_jank\_in\_elden/m8dchhk/?context=3)
* Can use his ranged Spinning Gravity Bomb attack at point-blank (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBa-lY4M8VA&t=469)
* The downward slam attack ignores i-frames (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1grbbb6/i\_know\_radahn\_is\_jank\_but\_what/)
* The stomp hitbox sometimes triggers earlier than usual (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1f2j4pc/consort\_radahns\_ground\_stomp\_hit\_me\_before/), presumably due to the elevation from the terrain
* The uneven terrain in the center of the arena make dodging certain attacks way harder through making it so that dodging left during some of his swipes will still get you caught in the light beams (especially since he is always moving forward and physically pushes you into them)
* Camera can be blocked completely when he uses the stomp attack (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBa-lY4M8VA&t=301)
* The player can end up in a different starting position during the Phase 2 opening, especially when the phase transition is triggered during a riposte
* Light of Miquella is not a scripted Phase 2 opener, there’s a slight yet decent chance that he will use another move (especially if you run up to him after the phase transition)
* The visual clutter of the light pillars can obscure his attacks
* Miquella’s hair blocks his swords when attacking him from behind, thereby making it incredibly difficult to intuit and react to his tells
* The Clone attacks have weirdly fucked up tracking (sources: [https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1hxtaum/hey\_radahn\_what\_the\_fuck\_is\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1hxtaum/hey_radahn_what_the_fuck_is_this/), [https://imgur.com/lHVuLrB](https://imgur.com/lHVuLrB), [https://imgur.com/X6zndJ9](https://imgur.com/X6zndJ9), https://imgur.com/6uiMdgc)
* The Meteors also have weird tracking (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1i5qky9/weird\_but\_okay\_it\_was\_kinda\_funny/)
* The walls in the arena can make sprint dodging his meteors or clones needlessly stressful if you’re close to them

That's all I could find. Like I said, feel free to suggest any edits because I will gladly take them into account."

**Market Timing Model Status Update**    Market status is green.  Portfolio position should be in equities. However, if the S&P 500 10-Day simple moving average declines such that it’s less than 30 degrees from a vertical line drawn, that would change the market status to red, which would mean temporarily stop investing in equities and some of the stop sell prices would be adjusted.  The current 10-Day slop is getting close to the red zone status threshold.  Stay tuned.  It didn’t help stocks and equity index funds that the treasury yield climbed, with expectation of a delayed reduction well beyond January 28 – 29^(th) fed meeting.

🛠 **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ⚒️

*The information detailed in this narrative is undergoing review and is in the process of being written and uppdated.*

Our philosophy within the r/SSDI_SSI Subreddit is to share our experiences to try to assist others. It does not necessarily mean that our experience will be a duplicate of your current experiences or outcomes.  

Sometimes? 

Just knowing that someone else has made it through similar difficult processes may make a huge difference to the stress you are currently (or soon could be) experiencing.

The following discussion of SSI Backpay is written from the viewpoint of a claimant. 

This narrative will assist you in comprehending some of the issues involved.

The entire SSA disability application process can be intimidating. 

If you are prepared? Or know a little bit about what might occur?

It could make all of the difference in the world. 

#Medical vs Non-Medical Approval

SSA personnel are really not encouraged to verbally relay information regarding your application status. 

Each step of the process is unique. Please make note that: 

■ A medical approval does not equate to a [non-medical - click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSDI_SSI/s/Wy66qtuTBo) approval. 

■ You need to have a medical and non-medical approval in order to receive full application approval.

■ Also? An application can always be sent for a quality review. The quality review process can change the outcome of your case so that it is the exact opposite of what you have been told verbally. 

#SSI Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) Amounts

The SSI program is a federal program,not a state program. The amounts disbursed are the same in every state.

The maximum SSI FBR for 2025 is $ 967.00 per month. Most people make a lot less.

>*For 2025, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) FBR is $967 per month for an eligible individual and $1,450 per month for an eligible couple.*

#SSI Backpay Payment Structure

If you have been approved for SSI? 

■ You will not receive all of your back pay at once. 

■ It will be **divided into 3 separate payments,** and you will receive them every 6 months.

■ You will have a **certain amount of time** to spend your back pay, detailed below.

>*Luckily, the SSI program makes an exception for lump sums of disability backpay. The rule is actually that **you have nine months to spend your retroactive** pay. (If you receive more than one lump sum installment, you have nine months to spend the money each time you receive an installment).*

#Spending SSI Disability Backpay

Regarding your backpay, you must spend it.

If you have been approved for SSI?

There are limits that you need to adhere to in terms of assets that you can have on hand. 

You can only have $ 2,000 in assets.The SSA can check this frequently. They will make changes to your benefits if you are over the asset limit.

Check [*my*SocialSecurity](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount) to see make note of the application status.

You are allowed to purchase certain items without penalty or worrying about asset issues.

>*■ First, you can pay for current expenses, such as: pay rent or paying down your mortgage; put down a security deposit on a rental; repair or retrofit your house or apartment; pay off debts; stock up on food staples, and pay for health insurance premiums and other medical expenses.*

>*■ Second, you can purchase any of the following assets, which won't count toward your SSI asset limit: a car or truck; clothing, furniture, a computer, and other household goods; a house, apartment, or mobile home; tools for a business you want to start; life insurance (up to $1,500 cash surrender value), and burial spaces, contracts, and $1,500 in burial funds put into a separate account.*

#Does SSI Backpay Count as Income? 

If you live in a state that collects taxes on SSA? You must pay SSA taxes.

>*At the state level, policies vary: 41 states and the District of Columbia **do not tax Social Security benefits,** while nine states do. Rates vary by state, as do the exclusions and income limits.*

You must include the 1099 that you receive.

>*You must include the taxable part of a lump-sum payment of benefits received in the current year (reported to you on Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement) in your current year's income, even if the payment includes benefits for an earlier year.*

#Backpay and Taxes

##Backpay

>*You must include the taxable part of a lump-sum payment of benefits received in the current year (reported to you on Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement) in your current year's income, even if the payment includes benefits for an earlier year.*

>*However, there are two ways to determine the amount of income to include:*

>*■ You can use your current year's income to figure the taxable part of the total benefits received in the current year; or*

>*■ You may make an election to figure the taxable part of a lump-sum payment for an earlier year separately, using your income for the earlier year.*

>*You can select the lump-sum election method (by checking the box on line 6c of your [Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040) or [1040-SR](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-sr) if it lowers the taxable portion of your benefits:*

>*■ Under this method, you refigure the taxable part of all your benefits (including the lump-sum payment) for the earlier year using that year’s income.*

>*■ Then you subtract any taxable benefits for that year that you previously reported.*

>*■ The remainder is the taxable part of the lump-sum payment. Add it to the taxable part of your benefits for the current year (figured without the lump-sum payment for the earlier year).*

>*■ Worksheets in [Publication 915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-915) can help you calculate the taxable portion using this method.*

##Taxes

If you live in a state that collects taxes on SSA? You must pay SSA taxes.

However, your tax liability does not start until you reach the tax minimum. This means you will not be taxed on your benefits until your income reaches $25,000 or $32,000 based on your filing status. You can opt into tax deductions in order to reduce the amount you owe on your yearly tax return. This is especially helpful if you think you will owe taxes at the end of the year.

>*At the state level, policies vary: 41 states and the District of Columbia **do not tax Social Security benefits,** while nine states do. Rates vary by state, as do the exclusions and income limits.*

You must include the 1099 that you receive.

>*You must include the taxable part of a lump-sum payment of benefits received in the current year (reported to you on Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement) in your current year's income, even if the payment includes benefits for an earlier year.*s

#Installment Payment Requirements


>*The installment payment requirement applies when an individual (or eligible couple) is eligible for past-due SSI payments and the payment amount equals or exceeds three times the current maximum Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) plus any federally administered State supplement after reimbursement for interim assistance (IA) or direct payment of representative fees.*

>*In applying this formula, we subtract any overpayments or penalties we withhold from the past-due SSI payments. For instructions on determining the amount of past-due SSI payments, refer to [SI 02101.020C.6](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0502101020#c6) and [SI 02101.020D.8](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0502101020#d8) in this section. For the exception to priority of payment order when there is a prior overpayment and payable representative fees, refer to [SI 02101.002](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0502101002).*

NOTE: 

At the pre-effectuation review conference (PERC) interview, we will inform individuals they can receive more of the underpayment right away if they have debts or expenses








#When Will You Receive Your First SSI Back Payment?

It could take 30 days or even more before your very first SSI backpay payment is received (your official USPS snail-mail approval letter is a good start).

Sometimes, funds are deposited before you receive the USPS letter.

With all of the issues that are occurring (including lack of staffing, personnel retiring without personnel slots being filled, lack of resources and training, etc.)? It might take a lot longer.

#Peer Review

Peer reviews previously occurred if an underpayment to a beneficiary was over $5,000.00. Peer review (by a fellow employee) had to occur before funds could be sent to the beneficiary.

>*Progress on underpayments
In fiscal year 2024, our agency prioritized addressing barriers that prevent timely release of underpayments. For example, this year we updated a policy that required underpayments over $5,000 to be reviewed by another employee - a peer review - before we released the underpayment. In March 2024, we increased the amount from $5,000 to $15,000. Underpayments less than $15,000 may now be released without peer review.*

As of March 2024, the amount was increased to $ 15,000.00.

Meaning? 

Underpayments less than $15,000 may now be released to the beneficiary  **without peer review.**

How will this new policy affect the SSI beneficiary?

All SSI recipients will be able to receive payment much sooner.

>*This policy change means the time it takes for SSI recipients to receive their first installment payment is now dramatically reduced.*

A peer review will take place before any nenefotd / funds can be disbursed.

#Underpayment Period

>*The underpayment period is a period under review which begins with the month for which there is a difference between the amount paid and the amount due (either an additional amount due or excess payment or a change in the previously computed amount of either of these). The period ends with the month in which the determination for the period is made.*

#Effect of Underpayment on Resources

>*See SI 01130.600 regarding excluding SSI underpayments. This rule applies to an SSI underpayment received by the individual or a survivor.*

#Windfall Offset

If your SSI has been suspended because you do not qualify due to the SSA determinination that SSDI approval has placed you over the limitations of SSI?

You should still receive all of your SSI backpay.

However?

Any SSI back payments that were due at the same time that your SSDI was active?

Will be deducted from your SSDI payment(s).

The SSA does this to make sure you are not getting ""double pay"" for the same period of time where they overlapped. It is called a Windfall Offset.

>*We will reduce your retroactive Social Security benefits if you are eligible for Social Security and SSI benefits for the same months. We reduce your Social Security benefits by the amount of SSI you would not have received if we had paid you Social Security benefits when they were due. Most cases with windfall offset can be processed quickly. However, in some complicated situations, calculating the windfall offset may cause a delay in getting your retroactive benefits paid.*

#State Supplementary Payments (SSP)

Thea [HH State Supplementary Payments (SSP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSDI_SSI/s/9MNRpxjejj) narrative I wrote details additional benefits SSI beneficiaries are eligible for (re: as a supplement to SSI benefits). Forty-six states and the District of Columbia offer SSP.

#Information Pertaining to ABLE Accounts

You might want to consider an ABLE account in order to save money that will not be tied to the SSI aasset limit requirements.

>*A contribution is the deposit of funds into an ABLE account.  Any person may contribute to an ABLE account for an eligible beneficiary. Typically, contributions for an ABLE account may not exceed the annual gift tax exemption ($18,000 in 2024).*

#Information Pertaining to a Special Needs Trust (SNT)

A Special Needs Trust (SNT) ensures that assets are held in an account and will only be used to support the beneficiary.

It's important to speak to an attorney that specializes in SNTs.

"CA- Adult special needs  brother entirely left out of father’s estate planning, in favor of disabled spouse.",EstatePlanning,1gyd6k0,2024-11-23 18:37:53,0,0.47,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstatePlanning/comments/1gyd6k0/ca_adult_special_needs_brother_entirely_left_out/,OregonCoastGreenman,"Yes, I have included the state or country in the post","It a long mess to describe.  So only read if you have the time and interest.

  I am the non disabled son, and have lived with and taken care of mildly mentally challenged brother for last 30 years or so, in a different state than Dad lived in.

He did not specifically disinherit this disabled son in will or as beneficiary of either trust, but there is literally no mention of him anywhere.  I know my father had absolutely no ill intent or reason not to want him to benefit from the estate. RDP’s claim is “they left him out to protect him from losing means tested benefits.”   RDP is highly narcissistic person with drug addictions and weight/eating related health conditions, as well as claiming to have multiple personality disorder.  Never seen the diagnosis, but she is definitely crazy enough to have it.

  She somehow convinced Dad that she would preserve house and family heirlooms for kids, all left to her and her SNT.  Of course the heirlooms of monetary value dissapeared long before he passed.

  During their lives together they kept separate financial households to protect her means tested benefits, and she received ~300 hours a month of IHSS funded caregiver support, including our father being paid by IHSS for care he provided for her.  ($1800 of their $7k a month, until he became too ill, and then she continued filling out his time sheets logging on to the IHSS system as him, and incurring him a ~$2300 overpayment case which she was in a huge hurry to pay, but I was not, because caregiver roommates were telling me she did the timesheets online while he was recovering from brain biopsy that affected his memory and cognitive functions for a while, according to roommate caregivers.

    RDP, received ~$244 to $300k injury auto accident settlement, after litigation immediately prior to July 2021 creation of SNT, which was previously only testamentiary, with payment arriving 1-2 mo’s after it’s creation.

  Father and RDP then moved settlement money into Father’s name through at least two financial vehicles of unknown and questionable to me legality, to protect her excessive amount of means tested benefits.

  They were:

 He gave her 1/3 interest in living trust owned house, then bought it back for $94k, a few days later, with recorded deeds of conveyance with the county.

and also provided itemized list of $150k in expenses for her over 20 years spent on RDP, and promissory note from RDP to father, to litigation attorney, that promised in 2002, that RDP would pay him back if she “ever won the lottery or had some large financial windfall. (In examining my father’s computer I found, and backed up in case of her deleting data later, files showing that the backdated promissory note was manufactured by father weeks before settlement payout, to look like it was from a dot matrix printer like they would have owned in 2002.)

     During the following 14 months the $244-300k was depleted from father’s account, with father and RDP claiming not to know where it went, and entire $244k was gone in ~14 months, while they had $7000 a month in combined income, and there is nothing to show for it.

  I, (non disabled brother) was there to care for father and RDP and household of 3 fully subsidized for food, utilities, and housing, “care giver” roommates, for last 4 months of fathers life as he was dying of 3 diseases, and was set to be executor and dual trustee of father’s living trust, but became extremely frustrated with RDP not wanting to investigate missing money, and have come through some information gleaned from a friend of father who visited after money went missing, but about 2 months before I was able to get there.  Between his visit and my arriving to provide end of life care, father had brain cancer biopsy, so may have forgotten things he previously knew.

  Friend of father reported being informed by teller while visiting the bank with them, when she stepped away, that there was an account with $100k, jointly held by father, and “some other woman” besides RDP.  He also reported having had a conversation with their them and their estate planning attourney who had then became solely her attorney as beneficiary, where he said that he thought they should use the $100k to pay off credit card debt, and home equity loan.  Her attourney said she could not advise her on that one way or the other…
   
    I was asked to handle banking for his accounts as part of my caregiving, and was able to see back 2 years in online banking which showed the last 6 months and last $80k disappearing.  It mostly went out in even hundreds of dollars PayPal transactions, and even thousands of dollars checks from father, to father. (ie to deposit $$$ in another account he is owner or co owner on… but no account I was made aware of, had any money, and when we went to the bank together, I did not know to ask about any accounts that had been open and later closed, in the past 3 years… so may well have missed finding out then.

  I believe she knew where this money went and allowed her Domestic partner to go with healthcare and cleaning needs unmet, and living in unnecessary financial hardship during that last year of his life, 2023, in violation of her fiduciary duty as RDP, to protect him from fraud, in all likelihood, part of committing fraud against him herself.  (Roommate caregivers are known drug users and the one that she changed to be her successor trustee is a multi stroke felon with decades of felonies and a currently active warrant for failure to complete substance abuse treatment, as of Nov 10, 2024, on a 2020 meth case, and has a new case that has not been arraigned yet in an adjacent county.

   It was a chaotic and conflict filled situation where she called the police on me, or lied to mandatory reporters on the phone about situations where we were having verbal arguments, to initiate approximately 10  police calls on me in 4 months there. I was never cited or arrested, and having done a records request, some police CAD reports ended with “Not as reported” and “no problem at that time except civil situation.”

  One of the CAD reports, was the day, about 3 weeks from the end of his life, when I took him to the local PD to report elder financial abuse, after it was suggested on a call to the clerk at the county DA’s office, as I had to try to do something after, while driving my dad home from dialysis, I said “Y’know Dad… NONE of us (family name) relatives trust her to protect the house or ANY family heirlooms for us like she says. And the fact that she does not want me to search for the money, is weird.  I think she probably had something to do with all that money disappearing.”   Dad sighed and let out a defeated “yeah…”

  Sadly I did not know to, or really have the resources, to independently contact an estate litigation attorney, as Dad almost certainly would have changed his estate to not leave it all under her, and a meth dealer’s control.

Ultimately, a month and a half after he passed, when I returned to their state from mine, after bringing fiancé and our pets home and settling down for a week, with the intent to proceed with executor duties, she filed a restraining order against me over my being incensed that she and or roommates had raided food and other things from my room there, that I had left for the 2nd trip home, with her making  entirely false attestations about physical abuse… and of course she won after her theatrics to APS, the police, and other social services workers, and without me having any legal representation, as I was almost financially underwater when I went there (at her request) and fully so, by the time I went home.

  I let her have her restraining order and left, and followed the no contact portion of the order.   She ultimately had me removed as trustee of the trusts and I had basically stopped forward motion on executor duties, never obtaining letters testamentiary, as I found out she was not forwarding estate related mail, and I was not willing to communicate directly with a person with multiple mental diagnoses, and a restraining order against me that ordered “no contact” but also ordered   “communication by text about trust and special needs trust” 

  She never had me removed as executor, and I never moved with the Probate court to file for letters testamentiary, and banks and getting EINS and such… so will likely be including my resignation letter when returning the estate documentation and my fathers passwords for online accounts given to me before he passed, to the meth dealer successor trustee.  I also never paid myself anything for acting as fiduciary for the short period I did after my fathers passing, but before the banks with any money in the accounts, found out he was dead.   Arranged and paid for Dad’s cremation, did grocery shopping for her and by extension her household of crackhead “caregivers” gave her money from those accounts for a memorial service that I could not attend.

  Dad signed a rental agreement to allow us to stay in the freezing back “sun porch,” through the winter, when she wanted me out right after finance and I first arrived because I tried to ask a question of her first attorney, as I was thinking she(attorney) was working for both of them as when she set up the SNT in 2021, and earlier, a redo of Dad’s living trust, and updating references in his will in 2016.)

  The question was: As estate fiduciary, would I have a responsibility to investigate potential financial fraud against my father that occurred within the statute of limitations before his passing.

  RDP freaked out and yelled no no no, and blew up the meeting and told me later when we were alone, that she “was going to get me out by any means necessary, so the next day, I wrote the rental agreement and he signed it while we were on our way to dialysis.

  Near the end, Dad gave me power of attourney superseding hers, after I saw that she was more focused on what to do with his $50,000 life insurance after he was gone, than with allowing for his care… 

  Looking back on it, I believe she intended to infuriate me with many of her actions, create the many false police reports and concern from social service workers, by playing victim, and plan so many things for my dad, medically and for meeting her “needs” that she would keep my wheels spinning and keep me from figuring out what had happened sooner, and who to call about it.   

  Sadly it was only in the last week of his life that Dad came around and realized I’d had to pull out the power of attourney during his previous hospital stay, to keep her from having the doctors to put him on hospice… When his doc from the dialysis clinic had just said to me out in the hall, on a Saturday, “He’ll come out of it… we’ll see you Tuesday”

  She was extremely angry when I pulled my power of attourney (had not told her about that or the rental agreement with dad) and when I told him she wanted to put him in hospice, he was ready to annul their domestic partnership and she was pleading with him “I don’t need your life insurance, just the pension.”  And Dad, according to roommates, told her he didn’t want her around any more.  Sadly he died too soon after that, without recovering mentally enough, for me to have figured out what to do in that moment to change anything with the estate.

  He was a SUPER loving and all forgiving person and she is a narcissistic parasite  who glommed onto him when step mother was dying of ALS 22 years ago and introduced them.   If the $300,000 from late 2021, had not all disappeared in that short period, leaving my Dad essentially broke, supporting her and her house of crackhead caregivers and homeless houseguests, for the last year of his life and not getting the proper care he needed,  I would not have such a big pit in my stomach and would just walk away and wait for her to pass… that might still be my best option.

   The two less methy, non trustee roommates, have related being disgusted by her use of screaming and “going crazy” any time my dad called her on something she did with frivolous spending or other betrayals over the years, but they also face homelessness if they displeased her then, and more so, now that my dad is gone, so people I kind of thought were allies at one time, really are not, in anything more than detesting her selfishness and tendency to take advantage of my fathers soft and kind nature.

  She is also just a truly disgusting person in that she eats so much and drinks so much water that she has uncontrolled diarrhea a good portion of the time, but prefers to be naked or wear sheer see through gowns, and does not wear diapers.

  My ultimate pleasure would be to force the sale of the house, due to her operating it like a drug dealing homeless shelter where people don’t have to get clean, but my understanding of it being held by the SNT, is that she can use the entirety of the 4 bedroom house purely “for her happiness”
until she passes or the trustee decides to sell…  

  Or would be happy if she, as I believe my dad intended, operated the house to produce some income for me, as 50% co-beneficiary on sale, and 100% on her passing…  

  But my understanding is it being in the SNT until she wants to sell, or her meth head trustee who is dependent on that house to not be homeless, wants  to sell…  apparently means she can use the other three bedrooms as rentals or continued “care giver work trade” purely for her own benefit for as long as she lives.

  I became aware recently, that besides the less easily proven potential fraud, with possibly unrecoverable losses of the assets, and probably not worth pursuing, it is not generally acceptable for a parent to entirely leave an adult disabled child out of their will, and I believe it was undue influence on her part, that allowed it to be set up this way.

   She claimed it was done that way, “leaving disabled brother’s share to me” to protect his qualifying for means tested benefits” that he already does not qualify for because he has stocks inherited when he was a minor that we have not been able to sell because they were still held in my father’s name as trustee under the California uniform gift to minors act, and we had not been able to get dad to do the paperwork to transfer them into his name to sell.

  I don’t really care about money for me, and would just grudgingly wait for her to pass or decide to sell the house, but I worry for two reasons.

  If the house becomes a total loss, insurance is set to pay into her SNT in cash… Then both brother and I wind up with nothing.  Or if continued drug dealing activity being allowed at the house causes civil asset forfeiture, the same.   

  If I die before it sells, my disabled brother winds up with nothing, from the estate of his father, who absolutely would have wanted him to have something but was guided by a selfish spouse and perhaps inept/preferential toward his spouse, estate planning attourney.

  I do not want to challenge the estate on my part. Just don’t want to manage it, and have stepped away from that.  I would certainly move to push for sale if I could provide actual proof and not just multiple people’s observation, that street drugs are being sold, and not just used there.  And I don’t want to get on the wrong side of the “and anyone who challenges this will gets $1” clause.

  My brother, not having been left anything runs no risk of losing anything, to challenge it.

  To my mind, he probably should, as he has less earning potential in his life than I do, or she does, and should have had the same type of SNT set up for him to receive 1/4 or 1/3 of the house like me, if sold before she passes, or 50% if sold after she passes, or 100% if both of us have passed.

  She has close to 4000 in income a month, with her SS, dad’s SS, and 3/4 of his teacher’s retirement, so I am not worried about making her homeless, or wanting to challenge her beneficiary status completely, unless obviously actionable evidence of fraud is found, as I also know that even in wanting her out of his life, dad probably would have still given her the monthly benefits, being the all forgiving person that he was…

  Any estate planning people able to tell me whether my brother should talk to an attourney, and look at challenging being left entirely out of the estate?

  I just don’t want to unexpectedly die before she passes, or have the house as last real asset of the estate, lost in a fire or asset forfeiture, due to actions of her “caregiver crackhead” roommates, who have lived subsidized by Dad and the state solely for her (mostly not needed but she enjoyed living like a poop spewing whale queen, as others do all the things that keep her from having to do anything) 

  Brother is hard working and loves mowing the neighbors lawn, and other small things he can do, but is only marginally employable, as a non driver, in the rural area we live in that has almost no public transit.  He is very conservative with the $1050 a month or so, he gets from SS, and would actually do GOOD with any windfall he gets.   His total inheritance was a ~$750 payment to  

  We are both almost 50, and has had basically zero real support from Dad and RDP, for the 1/4 century that dad spent serving her “disabilities” and her wants to the tune of millions in combined assets and income.

  I believe they ran the house like a “no need to get clean” homeless shelter so that she would have access to street pain pills, and whatever else she wanted to obtain.  Dad was kind of a hippy, and a school teacher with a good retirement income, and also inherited a significant estate from his father who was head of a department at an Ivy League University in CA.

  She is a professional victim, and psychologically, a malignant narcissist in my non professional estimation.  I didn’t love her before spending 7 months in that household with her, first 4 of which, were spent caring for my father to my best ability, despite her and meth dealer/Trustee/girlfriend/roommate creating huge conflict and distrust…  Don’t want to make her homeless, but she is the kind of person I could see burning down the house and taking off to a non extradition country with her trustee and the insurance check paid into the SNT.

  Don’t want to let her do to me, and especially my brother, what she did to our Dad.

  My desire at minimum, would be to secure my brother a position in Dad’s trusts (even if it is 50% of mine, with survivorship for each, so that if I die, he gets 100% of the house after she passes.  And to have meth dealer roommate removed as co-trustee with another woman whom I actually trust to some degree and would not be opposed to having as a trustee.

  Would love to force sale of the house too, as the dealing and constant foot traffic of non rent paying street people is a significant risk, but that may be harder/not worth pursuing.

  If justice were to actually be served, a investigation into whether money was actually hidden from him by her, for the last year of his life, and she would be kicked out of all benefit of his estate, but I also know Dad would not want her homeless, so would not seek that.  She would be fine with her $4000 a month income, in a 2 bedroom apartment somewhere with her GF/Meth dealer/hopefully former, trustee.

Thanks in advance.

Problem with that is that Reddit in their filings to the SEC and their prospectus have provided endless 'we do what we can to keep practitioners', it's going to be Christmas and summer on the same day if this *subeddit* gets canned. Because a lovely letter to the SEC signed by the FCA would go their way immediately.

Please don't be concerned that I (or others here) give one hoot about the empty threats. It's mud throwing; avoid dialogue, walk away; and just as in real life; you showed your a weak piece of shit.  When you have coworkers approach you; scold you, avoid dialogue, and walk away, they were not worth your attention.

That aside; more stuff is coming.

Re-read it and ask yourself if you **understand** *everything* (except the trading part). If you don't get the latter part yet; but do get the **why/how,** your *likelihood* of positioning trades and feeling comfortable with risk/appetite enhances. If you don't understand the HUF trade; **i'm concerned if trading is anything for you**. And for a change I actually mean it.

\- i'm currently already working with Methrom and other firms on the synthetically reproduction of rubber to fight off Pirelli, the Italian listed stock. So far the results are looking good. Pirelli came with filings lately;

[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pirelli-c-spa-pllif-q3-190301275.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pirelli-c-spa-pllif-q3-190301275.html)

To no avail confirming the hypothesis that they are in trouble AND if trouble persists; China (who state-owns this firm) will drop them like a brick if Pirelli falls; cuz lads Pirelli sn't doing well.

[Danger lurks because of Michelin and their new technique to synthetically recreate tires cheaper and of higher quality](https://preview.redd.it/mv7z8r8n1d1e1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=193465e08cd2a24ed786d9c0e6de453a451c17fc)

I'm sure not everyone ever had a look at the big tire companies in the world compared to rubber but you have to be blind not see a comparison; and remember I'm a hamster cage guy, I look at the world of trading doing everything. 

[that is obvious we have ourselves the world leaders in tires + commodity](https://preview.redd.it/1p7ekb3m2d1e1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1d268fdb24c684011bd4dc49621fed98dd716c8)

The thing is; Michelin (and others) want to (for survival reasons) go the synthetic route;

A project I am helping with; why? because Pirelli's debt structuring and dependencies makes me feel like a disgusting mockery to a industry I was fond of;  Michelin has a beautiful constructed yield curve. Gosh; something tells me the folks at Michelin know what they are doing; and in Pirelli it's the Chinese drinking wine and pizza in Italy. This isn't a joke; Ive seen them do it.

[https://corp2-assets.pirelli.com/corporate/Resoconto\_intermedio\_di\_gestione\_30.09.2024\_ENG.pdf](https://corp2-assets.pirelli.com/corporate/Resoconto_intermedio_di_gestione_30.09.2024_ENG.pdf)

as you can read; **tonnes of structured revolving credit facilities; and above all; extending**.  The thing is; at Pirelli you don't hear anything about 'enhancing profit margin'. No, debt restructuring. Dillute stock.... We hear that shit in the US all the time. 

The problem with that is dual tail.

>**1) they are already under pressure by competitors**

>**2) they are state owned by Petrochem, a Chinese rubber company**

>So why are you so convinced synthetic rubber is going to be a better product and on top; a cheaper product?

Well; Pirelli was clever enough to mention that already; A snippet of their latest report;

[Gosh; why  would anyone stick with the physical if we can en-masse enhance our synthetic rubber production. ](https://preview.redd.it/jqkxlfno4d1e1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=b735119a9819b89078fc3f67cd20ee44a61c7662)

**Physical is FAR more expensive so you alter the ingredient.**

But as usual, the Chinese aren't mentioning anything about new techniques, enhancement of product line. The Chinese are best in copying what has been copied. 

Hence I got extremely excited when I read 3 french conglomerates are going to work on this technology;

[https://www.danone.com/content/dam/corp/global/danonecom/medias/medias-en/2024/corporatepressreleases/pr-danone-biotech-open-plateform.pdf](https://www.danone.com/content/dam/corp/global/danonecom/medias/medias-en/2024/corporatepressreleases/pr-danone-biotech-open-plateform.pdf)

So annoying, as I was I submitted my homework to them already. Excitement is not something you should kill; I knew all along that Michelin couldn't box with Pirelli due to excess supply of the physical inventory out of China, we are talking Michelin is already vv active in synthetic rubber.

[please give their annual report a read - they are good on the way to achieve a higher level of synthetic products. By definition \(not my rules\) that will enhance margins. Why? Physical \> more expensive than the chemical brother. Doh.](https://preview.redd.it/yhr90i9a6d1e1.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cefcae14d3199f41adff258b51a6310dffa116)

And instead of ignoring the new techniques (also applicable to glanbia, yili, sadafco, fonterra, etc); Michelin calls it by it's **name**;

[fuck yeah; creating magic!, when I read a French firm of all countries actually mentioning something in their report you know what it is. It is real](https://preview.redd.it/19govwfb7d1e1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=da9e1cf1c7b83b52f193b61f2f26dc1add21eae1)

Because Pirelli already doesn't have investment grade stock status of their debt (BBB+ junk) by the credit rating agencies; while Michelin does have the investment grade status; that means the large players (HF/banks) use a simple hardcoded filter; (y/n) on investment grade debt ranking. Pirelli is already losing on this end. And on top; they have solid short term liquidity traders at A level!

[https://www.scoperatings.com/ratings-and-research/rating/EN/177450](https://www.scoperatings.com/ratings-and-research/rating/EN/177450)

While Pirelli currently has BBB+ debt status.

And the smog, so fire isn't far away.

[could it be that petrochem cheaper than market price funneled to italian Pirelli? Hmmmm in a \(not corrupt\) country yes.](https://preview.redd.it/vudtv2wb9d1e1.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=5274f67e7dac6e61b0a5607e0c1814e535d57bad)

But I take one good look at their board; - because this is just a chinese puppet sailing under an italian flag; unless you only see Italians .....

[oh noes; I'm right.](https://preview.redd.it/74z55gon9d1e1.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=178e73726c65386641ecf1cc2691835b3b14e8f5)

Given the Chinese reverse merger fraud scandal in 2014; and this nonsense; i'm expecting that the debt and shit profit margin and (their not being willingly to enhance technology) will kill them of the throne; and Michelin will take over. 

However be wary that the Chinese are going to ""try again"" with the ""pump more money"" method. But a bleeding soldier will still die if all you do is bandaids, and not fucking solving the actual problem. 

That's a paradigm shift given the likelihood Goodyear, Bridgestone, Michelin are far more likely to work together than these Chinese marionettes.

***- so what do I expect.***

\- Michelin is stating a completely new path with using cheaper commodity to fight off the = Chinese.

\- You've seen the numbers synthetic > fossil. So this is a ticking time bomb. It merely is a question of timing.

\- Pirelli will die; Michelin will take over; perhaps a buy out. The Chinese in usual fashion will drop it like a brick once the ship sinks.

Pricing wise it's not good.

[https://cbonds.com/bonds/459657/](https://cbonds.com/bonds/459657/)

But not all is lost; I'm currently almost around +/- $1m in my synthetic milk/rubber value play for next year.

[arithmetic tells me Pirelli is a ticking time bomb; and Michelin is not. Given I know when the top ETFs of Pirelli are reshufled; you can more or less forecast when the famous iShares, Vanguard etc; will replace that Pirelli like shit on flies.](https://preview.redd.it/0nwubvxagd1e1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=38507a2f7a16b4b58e250094da48af52a84eed0a)

I've ranked all the ETFs w/michelin w/rubber and w/pirelli

[https://www.justetf.com/uk/stock-profiles/IT0005278236#etfs](https://www.justetf.com/uk/stock-profiles/IT0005278236#etfs)

and build boxes around that scraped by the reshuffle date from the issuer. Gonna win it this time. As I simply don't see Pirelli do a hail nary out of a sudden while ETFs have hardcoded reshuffle dates and requirements.

***Short Summary;***

\- please specify any kind of request you lot wanna deep dive in; I myself an running stuck on false positives on my contrastive machine learning algorithm as the final check for a buy/sell order is created through my API to various brokers.

\- i've converted the majority of HUF, and up to $1m +/- i've invested in the various asset classes around 'synthetic' rubber as earlier explained by my reddit article where I saw pure shareholder value

\- their board of Pirelli is Chinese\*\*; not Italian\*\* - in otherr words we already know what they will do if the boat sinks; jump off.

\- why would they jump off? Synthetic en masse scale production of this rubber is far cheaper and immediately you get the flip in cash flow stream from below Pirelli to above Pirelli.  Pirelli doesn't have the infrastructure to fight with this - has a ill defined yield curve and that will kill them.

\- Michelin has a better financial position than Pirelli. They don't have as  much to lose as Pirelli while the latter is basically drowning in problems and sorrow constantly.

\- i still have my dividend stocks (NVO, XOM, CHEV, Nestle, P&G, Unilever and expect to hold them).

\- it's standard practice every year that retail firms publish annual filings in February. Given retail sales have been poor this year;  i've used a scraper on [finviz.com](http://finviz.com) to simply filter  out the weakest retail stocks.  Once that was done;  i did another;  healthy retail firms. Night and day

\- Given inventory sales (inventory, amortization/depreciation of goods) - i'm not expecting Pirelli to sell a lot of OLD overpriced inventory and will have to (logically) do a write impairment in Q1 on basicaly writing of 1 year old season material as no one wanted it.

\- all the other stocks i've mentioned here; aka the career guidance; not to get stressed;  the free data; please don't copy my behavior.  The best investors have in common that they aint much alike.

\--

please let me know what 'lower level financial literacy you'd like'.

And don't worry about thinking many of these reports take me time. 7/10 times I've done these off the shelf. I used to do this for a living remember. This is like a morning piss between waking up and breakfast."

Crypto assests with the most Github activity (commits),cryptoQandA,1gndh0v,2024-11-09 11:12:20,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1gndh0v/crypto_assests_with_the_most_github_activity/,maxikaz19,,"## Understanding GitHub Activity in the Crypto Space 

In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, **GitHub activity** serves as a crucial metric for assessing the development and sustainability of various projects. GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate on code, and the number of commits can indicate the level of ongoing development. This article explores the cryptocurrencies with the most GitHub activity, highlighting their significance in the market and providing insights for potential investors.

## Why GitHub Activity Matters

GitHub activity is often viewed as a proxy for a cryptocurrency's health and viability. Frequent commits suggest that a project is actively being developed and maintained, which can correlate with its long-term success. High levels of development activity can indicate:

- **Community Engagement**: Active projects tend to have vibrant communities that contribute to discussions and improvements.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: Regular updates often mean that the project is evolving to meet user needs and market demands.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Open-source projects allow stakeholders to monitor progress and assess whether developers are delivering on promises.

## Top Cryptocurrencies by GitHub Commits

Based on recent data from various sources, here are some of the cryptocurrencies leading in GitHub activity:

| **Rank** | **Cryptocurrency** | **GitHub Commits** | **Price (USD)** | **Market Cap (USD)** |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1        | Cartesi (CTSI)     | 1,246,000           | 0.1175           | 98.29 million         |
| 2        | Status (SNT)       | 882,851             | 0.0235           | 91.99 million         |
| 3        | Ethereum (ETH)     | 425,635             | 2,449.52         | 294.96 billion        |
| 4        | Bitcoin (BTC)      | 47,341              | 69,814.89        | 1.38 trillion         |
| 5        | Polkadot (DOT)     | Notable spikes      | Varies           | Varies                |

### Cartesi (CTSI)

Cartesi leads with over **1.24 million commits**, indicating a robust development team focused on scaling blockchain applications through Layer-2 solutions. Its price has seen positive movement recently, reflecting investor interest.

### Status (SNT)

With nearly **883,000 commits**, Status is another active project focusing on privacy and decentralized communication tools. Its consistent updates suggest a commitment to improving user experience in the crypto space.

### Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum remains a heavyweight with **425,635 commits**, showcasing continuous enhancements as it transitions to Ethereum 2.0. The extensive developer community around Ethereum contributes to its ongoing innovation.

### Bitcoin (BTC)

Despite being the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has maintained relevance with over **47,000 commits**. The ongoing development efforts focus on security improvements and scalability solutions.

### Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot exhibits significant GitHub activity, especially around major updates like parachain launches. This reflects its innovative approach to interoperability among different blockchains.

## The Role of Bybit in Crypto Trading

For those looking to invest in these active cryptocurrencies, platforms like [Bybit](https://cryptosacro.top/bybit/) provide an excellent avenue for trading. Bybit offers a user-friendly interface, competitive fees, and various trading options that cater to both novice and experienced traders. Its robust security measures ensure that users can trade with confidence.

## Analyzing Development Trends

The correlation between GitHub activity and market performance is noteworthy. Many of the cryptocurrencies with high development activity also rank among the top in terms of market capitalization. This suggests that projects which prioritize continuous improvement are more likely to succeed in the long term.

### Factors Influencing GitHub Activity

Several elements contribute to the level of activity observed on GitHub:

- **Project Complexity**: More complex projects often require more frequent updates.
- **Community Size**: Larger communities typically result in higher contributions.
- **Market Conditions**: Bull markets may spur increased development as teams rush to implement new features.

Monitoring GitHub activity provides valuable insights into the health and potential of cryptocurrency projects. With leading assets like Cartesi, Status, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Polkadot showing significant development efforts, investors can gauge which projects are likely to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.

For those interested in entering or expanding their presence in the crypto market, Bybit stands out as a reliable platform for trading these dynamic assets. As always, thorough research and understanding of each project's fundamentals are essential for making informed investment decisions.

By keeping an eye on GitHub commits alongside price movements and community engagement metrics, investors can better navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and identify promising opportunities for growth."

I'm under the impression they do the same basic thing in holding money that SSA doesn't count as resources and can be used to benefit the person.  Idk if there or any significant differences between SNT + ABLE at this point though.  Anyhow,  prior to disability approval at age 26 and 2 mths I was on welfare and had a medically disabled status with them so I definitely had same condition prior to age 26.

HH Childhood Disability Benefits (CDB),SSDI_SSI,1dnwe8r,2024-06-24 23:28:23,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSDI_SSI/comments/1dnwe8r/hh_childhood_disability_benefits_cdb/,Walk1000Miles,Helpful Hints and Tips,"⚒️ **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ⚒️

*The information detailed in this narrative is undergoing review and is in the process of being updated.*

Our philosophy within the r/SSDI_SSI Subreddit is to share our experiences to try to assist others. It does not necessarily mean that our experience will be a duplicate of your current experiences or outcomes.  

Sometimes? 

Just knowing that someone else has made it through similar difficult processes may make a huge difference in the issues you are currently (or soon could be) experiencing.

The following discussion of Childhood Disability Benefits (CDB), formerly known as the Disabled Adult Child (DAC) process, is written from the viewpoint of a claimant. If you have a family member or a loved one who will be experiencing the CDB process? This narrative will assist you in comprehending the program.

The entire SSA disability application process can be intimidating. 

If you are prepared? Or know a little bit about what might occur?

It could make all of the difference in the world. 

There are numerous disability programs (considered federal programs) available through the Social Security Administration (SSA) that provide support / income to claimants who are 💯% disabled.

>*To meet our definition of disability, you must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically determinable physical or mental disability(ies) that is either:*

>*■ Expected to result in death.*

>*■ Has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.*

#CDB Application Process 

To apply for CDB? You must [Contact Social Security by Phone](https://www.ssa.gov/agency/contact/phone.html).

>*At this time, you cannot apply for DAC benefits online. If you wish to file for benefits, contact us immediately.*

To speed up the application process, complete [Form SSA-3368-BK - Disability Report - Adult](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-3368.pdf) and have it available at the time of your appointment.

As your case proceeds, your file could be sent to other jurisdictions for a number of reasons (none of which you should take personally or have any control over) for processing.

#Eligibility Criteria for CDB

Many potential beneficiaries **do not know about the potential for CDB** until many years after their date of eligibility. It **does not affect their eligibility** or ability to apply.

Benefits for the children of eligible SSA recipients will be payable under certain conditions.

>*Child's insurance benefits may be payable for months in which the child is age 18 if either of the following are true.*

>*■ The person has a drisability that began before age 22.*

>*■ The person has a disability that began after age 22 and that disability began before the close of the 84-month period following the month in which the child's most recent entitlement to benefits as a CDB was terminated because the disability ceased.*

A CDB recipient would qualify in the following example:

>*A worker starts collecting Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. He has an unmarried 38-year-old son who has had cerebral palsy since birth. The son may start collecting a DAC benefit on his father's Social Security record.*

A child's current disability status is not a significant attribute when considering their eligibility for benefits as an adult. 

>*A child under age 18 may have a disability, but we don't need to consider the child's disability when deciding if they qualify for benefits as a dependent. The child's benefits normally stop at age 18 unless they are a full-time elementary or high school student until age 19 or have a qualifying disability. Children who were receiving benefits as a minor child on a parent’s Social Security record may be eligible to continue receiving benefits on that parent’s record upon reaching age 18 if they have a qualifying disability.*

If a beneficiary (re: parent, grandparent) currently receives SSA Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Retirement benefits or is deceased? Their dependents (re: biological child, adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, or step-grandchild) are eligible for SSDI benefits in the form of CDB.

>*When you qualify for Social Security disability benefits, your children may also qualify to receive benefits on your record. Your eligible child can be your biological child, adopted child, or stepchild. A dependent grandchild may also qualify.*

Certain criteria must be met to prove eligibility.

>*When a parent receives Social Security retirement or disability benefits or dies, their child may also receive benefits. Under certain circumstances, a stepchild, adopted child, or dependent grandchild or step-grandchild also may qualify. To receive benefits, the child must be unmarried and:*

>*■ Younger than age 18.*

>*■ Between ages 18 and 19 and a full-time student at an elementary or secondary school (grade 12 or below).*

>*■ Age 18 or older with a disability that began before age 22.*

The CDB is considered a *child's benefit.*

>*We consider this a ""child's"" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record.*

#Childhood Disability Benefits (CDB) Process

If you are an eligible claimant diagnosed with a disability before turning 22? You may be eligible for SSDI under a parents or guardians benefits: CDB (formerly known as disabled adult children [DAC]).

>*Social Security benefits for disabled children may continue as long as they are unable to work because of their disability.*

The CDB application will be evaluated by the Disability Determination Services (DDS).

>*If a child is age 18 or older, we will evaluate their disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services (DDS) in your state that completes the disability decision for us.*

That being said?

If an adult applicant is diagnosed with a disability before they turned 22 and continues to be disabled? They may be eligible for CDB coverage under their parent's or guardians work quarters / work credits if the parent retires, becomes1 disabled, or are deceased.

You **must have thorough documentation** that specifically proves your disability was **diagnosed before you reached the age of 22.** Such proof would include:

■ CAT Scans |■ psychological therapy 
:-------------|---------------------------|:
■ hospitalizations| ■ physician visits
■ medications | ■ tests
■ MRIs | ■ various other treatments
■ physical therapy	| ■ x-rays

#When a Currently Disabled Child Turns 18?

Benefits continue as long as the individual remains disabled. If a child receiving SSA Supplemental Security Income (SSI) turns 18? They should clarify via SSA if they meet the eligibility criteria for CDB.

>*""A **child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits** on his or her own record should check to see if DAC benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record when they reach age 18. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible.""*

#CDB and Assets

If you are eligible for CDB (via a parents work record or credits / quarters) you will receive SSDI and Medicare.

You are not eligible for SSDI (under your own work record or work credit / quarters) at the same time.

The rules for SSA SSDI apply to CDB, and you are free from all the SSI rules regarding assets.

However? Sometimes?

An individual may be eligible for and receive both CDB and SSI benefits at the same time.

Any CDB benefits you receive would offset the monthly SSI benefit.

If receiving both CDB and SSA SSI, it is very important to monitor all income and resources to maintain eligibility.

■ CDB is for adults with a qualifying disability that began before the age of 22, and 

■ SSI is for disabled individuals with limited income and resources.

#When is a Recipient Eligible for CDB?

An adult son or daughter, age 18 or over, is eligible to receive CDB if he or she:

>*Meets the definition of disability in [§507.1](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.05/handbook-0507.html#S0507-1);*

>*Became disabled before age 22;*

>*Meets the other requirements for child's insurance benefits see [§323](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.03/handbook-0323.html); and*

>*Is not imprisoned within the U.S. for conviction of a felony [§1850](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.18/handbook-1850.html).

>*See [§340](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.03/handbook-0340.html) for events that end these benefits.*

>*Note: There is no upper age limit for childhood disability benefits. Disabled adult sons and daughters can qualify on the record of a stepparent or grandparent in some cases.*

#Proving Disability Onset Before Age 22

An important component for CDB is proving that the onset of the disability occurred before the age of 22. 

While there is “nothing in regulations or statute” that explicitly demands ongoing and continuous disability, courts typically expect continuity. Any work performed since the disability onset must meet specific conditions, such as being an unsuccessful work attempt or not considered SGA.

#Collateral Estoppel

An applicant does not have to collect their medical records. It is definitely not the task of the applicant to collect tons of medical proof that a disability began before the age of 22 to make a new decision (especially if a prior decision will stand). 

In general? The rules of collateral estoppel have stayed the same and have not changed.

>*Under the rules of collateral estoppel, we will not again decide an issue the Social Security Administration (SSA) has already decided in a prior determination or decision, unless there are reasons to believe that the prior findinga on the issue was wrong. In a new claim, the Disability Determination Services (DDS) may adopt the findings of a prior favorable determination or decision.*

It is entirely up to the DDS.

>*The DDS has jurisdiction for all potential collateral estoppel claims received in the field office (FO) and pending below the administrative law judge (ALJ) level. Although the FO has jurisdiction for work activity development in a claim, the FO will not make collateral estoppel determinations.*

If there:

■ are reasons to believe that the prior decision was wrong.

■ is a new claim, the DDS may choose to make a favorable decision.

A prior determination may still be applicable.

>*While these adoption determinations often involve claims arising undeSocialð Security Act, it may be appropriate to adopt a prior determination or decision under the same title for a different type of benefit because the underlying principle of issue preclusion (whether designated collateral estoppel or res judicata) may apply in the same title context.*

DDS can reopen a prior favorable or unfavorable finding. 

>*DDS has the authority to reopen the prior favorable or unfavorable determination. If the DDS discovers the prior favorable or unfavorable determination was obtained by FSF and has the authority to reopen the prior favorable or unfavorable determination.*

#What Must the CDB Applicant Accomplish to Ensure Eligibility?

The applicant must be in compliance with all required forms of treatment (according to their diagnosis). Requirements regarding compliance may include (and not be limited to):

■ appointments |■ psychological therapy |
:-----------------|----------------------------|:
■ medication| ■ physical therapy|

#(1) Change in Diagnosis

Has the diagnosis changed since the last application was submitted? 

■ if the diagnosis has changed (re: a new diagnosis has occurred or a prior diagnosis is no longer applicable) since the last application date? New records may have to be ordered to ensure correct information is applied during the submission of the application.

■ the applicant must inform SSA of any new doctors or diagnosis they have received by submitting the appropriate information (re: facilities, medications, physicians, therapists, etc.).

#(2) Different Criteria for Adults vs Children 

Remember that SSA SSDI and SSA SSI have different disability criteria for adults vs. children.

#Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) and CDB

Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) refers to the monthly work activity considered to be substantial by the SSA. 

CDB applicants and recipients must be unable to engage in SGA. 

You can **apply for CDB if you have little or no work history** (because it's based on your parents' or grandparents' work history). Your work history or credit hours are not considered. A CDB applicant must not have had any history SGA.

If an applicant is **earning more than the SGA in a month?** They are considered to be earning above the SGA.

#(1) SSA SSDI vs CDB

SSA SSDI and CDB have various parallels when it comes to the benefits associated with the programs.

There is a significant characteristic that could place the CDB recipient at risk of losing their eligibility for CDB. A CDB recipient must be found to have been:

■ disabled prior to age 22, 

■ single, and 

■ ""continuously disabled” since turning 22.

If the CDB applicant is employed and earns over the SGA for **even one month** between their 22nd birthday and the day the parent retires, becomes disabled themselves, or is deceased? The applicant could risk their eligibility to collect benefits based on a parent or guardians' work record if they ignore all of the SGA criteria.

>*It is not necessary that the DAC ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. A DAC must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider substantial increases each year.*

#(2) If the CDB Works and Earns Above SGA

The SSA has determined that the term “continuously disabled” correlates to being incapable of earning in excess of SGA, which is $1,550 (non-blind) or $2,590 (blind) per month in 2024. 

If a CDB attempts working and earns more than the SGA for 9 plus months within a time frame of **five years,** it means they are capable of SGA and will lose their CDB status. 

In most cases, working above the SGA makes their ineligibility permanent.

Everyone (re: the CDB, representative payee, or their family members) must be aware of all reporting requirements regarding funds / support the CDB receives. Everyone should become aware of the risks that are taken when the CDB earns more than the allowed SGA.

#(3) Impairment Related Work Expense (IRWE)

The CDB must pay for any IRWE out of their SSA or other earned income. If the IRWE is accounted for, the CDB **may be able** to work and continue their eligibility for CDB.

■ The cost of the IRWE’s will be deducted dollar for dollar from their allowable SGA earnings. 

■ To qualify for the deduction that can be used, they must pay the cost of the IRWE.

■ If the parent or trustee of a special needs trust (SNT) pays for the IRWE, the expense deduction will not be allowed from the SGA level of earnings.

If an applicant for CDB meets the requirements of disability as an adult? They must make sure that all SGA issues are adhered to in order to ensure eligibility.

The CDB must prove (if they have ever worked) that you did not earn above the SGA during this time period to keep eligibility.

>*The monthly SGA amount for statutorily blind individuals for 2024 is $2590. For non-blind individuals, the monthly SGA amount for 2024 is $1550. SGA for the blind does not apply to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, while SGA for the non-blind disabled applies to Social Security and SSI benefits.*

It's truly interesting to see how many years have passed vs. how very low SGA increases have been.

Year | Blind | Non-Blind |
:-------:|---------|:---------------:|
1970 | $ 200.00| $ 200.00 
1980 | $ 417.00| $ 300.00 
1990 | $ 780.00| $ 500.00 
2000 | $ 1,17.00| $ 700.00 
2010 | $ 1,640.00| $ 1,000.00 
2020 | $ 2,110.00| $ 1,260.00 
2024 | $ 2,590.00| $ 1,550.00 
2025 | $ 2,700.00 | $ 1,620.00

You must be cognizant of SGA and how it correlates to all aspects of the CDB process.

>*We generally use earnings guidelines to evaluate whether your work activity is SGA. If you are working in 2024 and your earnings average more than $1,550 ($2,590 if you’re blind) a month, you generally cannot be considered to have a disability.*

#If a CDB Recipient Loses Coverage Due to SGA?

If a CDB recipient loses coverage due to earning above the SGA? It is possible for the beneficiary to become reentitled.

>*The 1972 amendments allow a beneficiary to become reentitled to CDB on the same record:*

>*■ At any time when the previous entitlement terminated due to substantial gainful activity (SGA) (no time limit); or*

>*■ Within 7 years when the previous entitlement ended due to any other reason, including medical recovery.*

#CDB and an Adopted Child 

How does being adopted affect CDB eligibility?

All ties with an applicant's biological parents are severed at the time of all adoptions. An applicant is not eligible for benefits under a biological parents' work credits / history.

When you were adopted, you became eligible for CDB benefits under your adoptive parent(s) work record. You are / were their dependent and are covered under their work credits. 

#If a Parent is a Veteran

This situation would change if a biological parent was a veteran. Then? Certain veteran benefits could pass to the biological child (or a child who was adopted).

#Marriage and CDB Eligibility

If a CDB recipient marries another recipient of CDB or other Social Security benefits? Their benefits will continue.

>*A DAC recipient can retain Social Security benefits upon marriage if that marriage is to another DAC or Social Security recipient.*

A CDB recipient will likely not lose Medicaid benefits upon marriage, even if they are rendered ineligible for SSI if their **(spouse is a recipient of CDB).**

They will still maintain Medicaid benefits.

>*In the context of marriage, if two spouses become ineligible for SSI due to an increase in DAC benefit entitlement to either of them, or if the combined DAC benefits rendered them ineligible under the couple’s SSI rate, but not the individual’s SSI rate, neither of them would lose Medicaid eligibility upon their marriage.*

CDB benefits could be lost when a marriage occurs. Many beneficiaries are unable to marry the person they want to marry due to the Social Security rules regarding marriage.

#(1) Protected Marriages

Some marriages fall into a protected marriage category.  

>*To determine if a DAC recipient can retain benefits upon marriage, the pivotal question to ask is if the marriage is a “protected” marriage to another adult receiving Social Security benefits. If so, then the DAC may be able to maintain benefits. If not, then the DAC recipient falls outside the definition of an eligible recipient and cannot maintain benefits.*

#(2) Marriage Penalties

There is a marriage penalty applied if you marry someone who does not receive any SSA benefits.

>*Individuals receiving DAC benefits lose their monthly stipend and Medicare if they marry; they can also lose their Medicaid. The only exceptions are if the DAC beneficiary marries another DAC, a person on Social Security Disability Insurance, a person entitled to “old age” SSA benefits (earliest age 62), or a person receiving another “secondary” benefit. The loss of Medicare, Medicaid, and the stipend would be life-threatening for many people with significant disabilities. As a result, many DAC recipients cannot marry the person of their choice.*

#Example of SSA Family Benefits

There is a certain formula that the SSA uses to determine family / dependent benefits (re: biological child, adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, or step-grandchild).

>*Each family member may be eligible for a monthly benefit of up to 50 percent of your disability benefit amount. However, there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family. The total varies, depending on your benefit amount and the number of qualifying family members on your record. Generally, the total amount you and your family can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of your disability benefit.*

The following explanation points provide an example as if a beneficiary (parent or guardian) receives a monthly SSA SSDI check of $1,500.00

#(1) Maximum Family Benefits

The maximum family benefit amount (150% to 180%) of the SSDI beneficiary’s award would be calculated and split amongst family members.

Percentage | Benefit Amount
:-----------------:|--------------------------|:
150 %          | $ 2,325.00         
180 %          | $ 2,700.00

#(2) Disabled Child's CDB Benefit

A disabled adult child already receiving SSI benefits should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Circumstances may have changed (e.g. parent’s death, retirement or disability status) since the initial application. Higher benefits might be payable, and entitlement to Medicare may be possible.

If a child is eligible to receive CDB benefits based on an eligible parent's or guardian's SSDI benefit?

Depending on if their parent / guardian was alive (50%) or deceased (75%), the CDB recipient could earn the following:

Percentage | Benefit Amount
:----------------:|---------------------------|:
50 %           | $    750.00              
75 %           | $ 1,125.00


#(2) Adult's CDB Benefit

A CDB applicant is eligible for 50 % of the benefits of a parent, step-parent or guardian, etc., if they are alive.  

If the parent / guardian is deceased? An applicant would be eligible for up to 75 % of the parent / guardians SSDI benefits.

The CDB recipient would be eligible for Medicare after two years.

#(4) Family Benefits

If the SSA benefit amount is:

$ 1,500.00 x 150% = $ 2 250.00

The child would not receive $ 750.00 per month benefit.

The maximum family benefit amount would be calculated and split between the spouse and child:

$ 2,250.00 maximum family benefit minus the $ 1,500 beneficiary’s monthly benefit:

$ 2,250.00 - $ 1,500.00 = $ 750.00

$ 750.00 would be split between all eligible family members.

$ 750.00 ÷ 2 = $ 375.00 

A spouse and one child would each receive a benefit of $ 375.00 per month.

#CDB Benefits Are Not Based on SSA SSI

You **will not receive CDB benefits based on the SSI benefits** of a parent / guardian. 

You are eligible to receive CDB benefits if a parent / guardian:

■ paid into FICA or SECA, and

■  is currently receiving SSDI, retirement benefits, or is deceased.

>*An adult who becomes disabled before age 22 may be eligible for “child's” benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. Social Security considers this a **child's benefit** because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record.*

#Reentitlement Period (RP)

Certain protections apply to CDB applicants comparable to other beneficiaries who became eligible due to a change in circumstances, causing a reentitlement period (RP).

>*• CDBs have protection comparable to that of disabled widow(er)s who become entitled again to benefits if they recover from an earlier disability and then become disabled again.*

>*• The reentitlement period (RP) begins with the month following the last month of previous entitlement to CDB and ends with the close of the 84th month (7 years) following the month the most recent entitlement to CDB terminated due to disability cessation.*

>*• A child may again be entitled as a CDB claim if disability onset is within the 84-month reentitlement period and the child:*

>*(1) Is statutorily blind;*

>*(2) Is age 55 or over; and*

>*(3) Was engaging in SGA not comparable to relevant past work performed either before the later of date of attainment of age 55 or date the child became statutorily blind.*

Remember? The SSA can't approve you for CDB if you don't apply for it.

If you delay the application process for CDB? Potential benefits could be lost.

#Changes In the Law Are in Process

On January 13, 2022, Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20) introduced [H.R.6405 - Marriage Equality for Disabled Adults Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6405), which, if passed, would change current law to allow CDB recipients to freely marry without losing their benefits. A resolution in the California legislature, [SJR 8 - Senate Joint Resolution No. 8 Chapter 8 - Relative to Social Security Disability Insurance](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SJR8&mc_cid=e1a0c28a88&mc_eid=7d609c1779) supports the elimination of CDB marriage penalties.

Other legislation, including S. 2065, would help eliminate the penalties that prevent SSI recipients from freely marrying.

Santiment provided a list of ERC-20 tokens that are rising to a great extent. As per the company, these coins have reportedly experienced enormous rates of development activity during the last thirty days. $LINK, the native token of Chainlink, has occupied the 1^(st) position among the above-mentioned tokens. Chainlink operates as a well-known tech and crypto platform offering interaction services to blockchain entities for external data.

In addition to this, the 2^(nd) token in the list is the ERC-20 coin $SNT of Status. Status works as a decentralized and open-source crypto communication application. It takes into account a browser, a wallet, a messenger, as well as communities. As Santiment disclosed, according to the past 30-day activity, $ETH (Ethereum Foundation’s local token) obtains the 3^(rd) position.

"Betrayal in Belarus: Judge Tomasz Szmydt seeks asylum, and the backstage of a Warsaw court is compromised.",neoliberal,1cmbaje,2024-05-07 08:58:12,36,0.92,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1cmbaje/betrayal_in_belarus_judge_tomasz_szmydt_seeks/,ghhewh,User discussion,"The whole country is in shock that judge [Tomasz Szmydt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Szmydt) of the [Voivodeship Administrative Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeship_Administrative_Court) in Warsaw has applied for asylum in Belarus and, to put it mildly, has betrayed our beautiful homeland. 

I have the strong impression that the case is developing, because this is not the only judge on this court who has interesting connections. Take the example of [mr. Jacek Mrozek](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacek_Mrozek), who was appointed by [president Duda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Duda) in May last year after much wrangling. 

The matter needs a brief introduction. In her excellent article entitled '[The new Dyzma of Collegium Humanum](https://oko.press/nowy-dyzma-z-collegium-humanum)', Anna Mierzyńska of [OKO.press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKO.press) introduced the very strange character of Kamil Całek. He is a former policeman, an incurable mythomaniac who, however, quite truthfully cooperated with the pro-Russian politician [Leszek Sykulski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszek_Sykulski) and was active in the Polish-Russian Brotherhood. The latter organisation acted as a propaganda tube for the Kremlin and actively recruited Russia supporters on social networks. 

In Mierzyńska's multi-layered investigation, there is not enough room for some of the supporting characters, such as Jacek Mrozek, Kamil Całek's close associate. What are the links? Let's look at the [PiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice)-controlled [National Council of the Judiciary's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_the_Judiciary_(Poland)) [resolution of 25 March 2021.](https://sip.lex.pl/akty-prawne/akty-korporacyjne/przedstawienie-wniosku-o-powolanie-do-pelnienia-urzedu-na-cztery-287631224) This is how Jacek Mrozek's candidacy for the Court was presented:

>By decision of the Director General of the Central European Centre for Strategic Analysis at the Marshal Józef Piłsudski Association of Reserve Officers of the Republic of Poland in Poznań dated 29 March 2019, he was appointed as an expert in SCAS security management. Mr. Jacek Janusz Mrozek improves his qualifications by attending training courses and conferences, as well as post-graduate studies in: corporate finance and accounting \[...\] management of a local government unit, control, supervision and audit in public administration, MBA, international relations and diplomacy. 

It all sounds very good until you dig a little deeper. The director of the centre is none other than Kamil Całek, whom Mierzyńska calls the 'new [Dyzma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Career_of_Nicodemus_Dyzma)'. The analysis centre itself is a complete sham. It is just a website on the Internet and has no legal status. It was used by Całek to give credibility to various defence conferences. The same goes for Jacek Mrozek's education - for example, his MBA from the diploma mill Apsley School, which is affiliated with the [Collegium Humanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_Humanum_%E2%80%93_Warsaw_Management_University). It is a worthless piece of paper.

In a statement before his appointment as a judge, Jacek Mrozek said that he was not a member of any political party or association. I hope that at least this statement was not a lie, because he certainly belonged, together with Kamil Całek and a whole group of other people, to a strange association called the Polish-Ukrainian Union. At one time he was also a member of PiS. [He ran unsuccessfully](https://wybory2007.pkw.gov.pl/SNT/PL/KOMITETY/k4_34.htm) for the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Poland) in [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Polish_parliamentary_election).

He has one thing in common with Kamil Całek. Mrozek embellishes his biography to the extreme. He is also a great fan of decoration. I checked it out. Całek boasts of eighteen medals on his website, but Jacek Mrozek beats him - he lists 40! 

Like Kamil Całek, he has been awarded the Covid-19 Cross of Merit, the Medal of Merit for [Territorial Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Defence_Force_(Poland)), the Medal of Merit for Polish Diplomacy and the Medal of the XXV Anniversary of the Union of Polish Monarchist Groups (LOL). However, Mrozek also has some very unique decorations, such as the commemorative badge of the 7th District Technical Workshop - awarded by the last living commander (2022), or the jubilee badge on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Honorary Blood Donors' of the [PCK ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Red_Cross)""Heart of a Miner"" Club. Even more surprising in this collection are such ordinary and fresh state decorations as the Silver and Gold [Cross of Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Merit_(Poland)), the [Commission of National Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_of_National_Education) Medal or the [Pro Patria Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Patria_Medal_(Poland)).

The list of Jacek Mrozek's academic achievements is as long as the list of honours. It is worth noting, however, that he was a member of the Polish Geostrategic Society, the Scientific Society of Eastern Studies and chairman of the Polish Geopolitical Society's [Ełk ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C5%82k)branch. All of these organisations are associated with Leszek Sykulski, the founder of what is now an openly pro-Russian party Safe Poland. He is also the author of publications in the Geopolitical Review. 

In 2019, he was a member of the organising committee of an international scientific conference named 'Innovative Thinking and Scientific Exploration of Student Youth', which took place in [Polessk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polessk), Russia. I should also mention that he was educated at the [Naval Academy in Gdynia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Naval_Academy). Like Kamil Całek, he studied diplomacy. A pro-Russian activist, Gracjan Cimek is a researcher at the Academy. The university also made its premises available for conferences on geopolitics by Sykulski. 

Mrozek also continued his education at the Gdańsk University of Science and Technology, where another pro-Russian academic, Professor Adam Karpiński, teaches. The most important and scientifically fruitful, however, was his collaboration with the [Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Stefan_Wyszy%C5%84ski_University,_Warsaw), where he obtained his PhD. I am more and more fascinated by this university, where there is a place for a Putin lover, [Adam Wielomski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Wielomski), and [Jan Żaryn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%BBaryn), who willingly cooperates with the pro-Russian group Polish Thought. 

I have no idea what the relationship was between Tomasz Szmydt and Jacek Mrozek, apart from the fact that they were appointed by the same president and sat on the same court. However, the amount of disturbing detail in Jacek Mrozek's biography should probably raise a red flag for all the agencies in Poland. I, for one, would hurry before he also gets the idea of going on holiday to Belarus. By a strange coincidence, Mr Jacek Mrozek's official website went down today."

SAINT/SNT protocol TMS- good reasons not to try dialing up TMS without the special targeting?,Psychiatry,1bhwqiq,2024-03-18 13:40:22,15,0.94,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1bhwqiq/saintsnt_protocol_tms_good_reasons_not_to_try/,snipawolf,,"If you don't know what I'm talking about: [1, ](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19070720)[2](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429?download=true)

The preliminary studies show it as more effective and better tolerated than ECT for MDD and has breakthrough treatment status approved by the FDA. Also going to be less regulatory barriers and contraindications. Seems like it could easily become gold standard treatment for many/most depressed and suicidal inpatients if initial studies are to be believed and can be performed in the window of a typical inpatient stay (5 days). 

Seems like the protocol does two things different from standard TMS and iTBS protocols.

1.) Target a specific part of dlpfc with MRI rather than landmarks

2.) Dial up the intensity A LOT, basically squeezing more than the typical 6 weeks of TMS into 5 days. 

The treatment is being developed by a private company (Magnus Medical). The algorithm for which part of the brain to target based on MRI is proprietary. [But it doesn't seem to change the target area very much vs. scalp methods like beam f3, 5.5cm method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8458642/#B32) (although there was a 2.5cm average distance from the target in smt study, which all seemed to cluster in an area posteriolaterally). . Getting multiple MRIs for targeting is a substantial cost and access barrier. 

The simpler explanation is that most of the benefit from the SNT over other existing itbs comes from dialing up the intensity, and we've basically been underdosing TMS by a lot the whole time. 

The algorithm based on MRI is patented and permission to charge $$$ for the treatment, but is anyone else just trying iTBS with just standard rTMS machine on the same schedule as SMT and comparing the results? 

Seizures are a documented possible but very rare adverse event from TMS and you'd be concerned about possibly inducing mania as well, but that's basically it as far as serious side effects and the overall risk seems very mild even compared to some of our common med regimens. No seizures or mania have been documented in the existing studies so far. 

How risky would it be medical-liability wise to set up and offer patients 5 days intensive rTMS on a similar schedule to SMT given this? (It would only be able to be offered out-of-pocket I assume given that insurance wouldn't cover at this intensity.)"

Step-up basis for funding a revocable stand-alone special needs trust?,Bogleheads,1aer3ff,2024-01-30 10:31:49,1,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1aer3ff/stepup_basis_for_funding_a_revocable_standalone/,aspie_mom,,"Help! I think we messed up...our ep attorney created  a grantor-status, revocable stand-alone snt for our special needs son who has never received govt public benefits.  There were conditions other than the surviving grantor's death that make it irrevocable such as the snt receiving retirement/life insurance funds or it being funded a specified amount from a party other than the grantors.

In our haste to try to grow the snt we created a taxable account at Vanguard and funded it with a selected mutual fund...now we're thinking it's not wise to do this since any of the above conditions that change the snt into an irrevocable trust makes it where we lose the step-up basis? If so, can we have the ep attorney go back and amend the snt to remove all the conditions of irrevocability and just have it where it only becomes irrevocable at the surviving grantor's death? Would that allow us to continue paying snt income based on our tax rate and keep the step-up basis for the snt assets until the survivor of us dies? Or is that still a no?

Our #1 goal is to try to grow the snt monies while we're alive and get taxed at our rate rather than at the trust level. We also want the snt monies to receive a step-up basis when the last of us dies...not sure if this is possible or that the only way to preserve the step-up is to keep it in the rlt (revocable living trust)?

The reason why we want to fund the snt now is to be assured that there is at least a nominal amount for our son in case it takes more time than expected for the trustee to move assets in the rlt to the snt...he'll at least have something while assets in the rlt get sorted...tia"
Disabled - When will I be enrolled in Medicare? How to avoid my inheritance affecting my Medicare premiums?,medicare,190cbht,2024-01-06 17:37:56,2,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicare/comments/190cbht/disabled_when_will_i_be_enrolled_in_medicare_how/,FlipperToo,,"Hi all. I started receiving SSI at age 58 due to my disability. Last year, when I turned 62, SSA forced me to take early-retirement Social Security. My status with the SSA is still ""disabled"", and that is unlikely to change. I am also on Medicaid, but am prospectively losing it, because I will be receiving an inheritance soon. I am trying to decide whether or not to set up a first-party special needs trust in which to place the inheritance, and thereby avoid losing Medicaid.  
  
I am trying to figure out scenarios for if I do set up an SNT, and if I do not. I am also trying to figure out whether my inheritance will affect what I pay in Medicare premiums. I paid an elder lawyer a lot of money, and he has given me a lot of inaccurate information. He was focused on Medicaid, gave me inaccurate info about that, and never once mentioned the inheritance affecting Medicare. Apparently, under some circumstances, when you are enrolled in Medicare, an inheritance will cause your Part B premiums to skyrocket. I have also gotten contradictory information about that from my local social services Medicaid Supervisor, and my local SSA office phone rep.  
  
My most urgent question right now is: when will I start receiving Medicare, and therefore what tax return will Medicare look back to to determine my premiums. Apparently, Medicare has a 2-year lookback rule, but I am not sure how it is applied. Even though I will receive my inheritance this month (1/24,) I'm pretty sure the distribution will go on my 2023 1040 (because my family's trust lawyer is using the 65 day rule.)  
  
I understand that Medicare has different procedures for enrolling people: Social Security rep told me that if I am still receiving Social Security 4 months before I turn 65, then I will be automatically enrolled in Medicare to start the month I turn 65 in 2025. In this scenario, the lookback would be to my 2023 1040 (which will show the inheritance.)  
  
In contrast, the Medicaid supervisor told me that since SSA still has me classified as disabled, that I will fall under the Medicare enrollment rules for people on SSDI: When I told her that I had never been on SSDI, she said yes, but that I am on Social Security Disability, because of my disabled status. People on SSDI, and according to the Medicaid supervisor, disabled people like me, who were once on SSI, but who were forced to take Social Security at 62, are automatically enrolled in Medicare 24 months after they receive their first SSDI payment. In January of 2023, I received my last SSI payment. I February of 2023, I received my first Social Security payment. This means I would automatically be enrolled in Medicare in February of 2025. In this scenario, the lookback will also be to my 2023 tax return, which shows the inheritance.  
  
Which of these is true? When will I actually receive Medicare. Will I be enrolled automatically? Is there any way, I can decline Medicare at 65 when offered it, and apply a year later in 2026, so that the lookback will to 2024, when I will only have my low Social Security payments? I understand there is a penalty for this. What is it? Is there any other way to get around my inheritance affecting my premiums? Go back to work? (Don't know how I would do that.) Set up the SNT?  
  
Seems unfair to classify my inheritance as income. It is going to increase my income dramatically, for just that one year. I have fallen into a very low income category ever since I have been unable to work, and that one year of bounce, just happens to be, as far as I can tell, my 2 year lookback for Medicare. And I have no control over when I received my inheritance.  
  
I so greatly appreciate anyone who has been willing to read through this far, and who has attempted to wade through this infuriating complexity. You'd think that hiring a lawyer would suffice to help me lay out these scenarios. The Medicaid supervisor said that I shouldn't bother looking for another lawyer, as they don't know the rules. She says they call Social Services every day, to try to get answers for their clients."

He was focused on Medicaid, gave me inaccurate info about that, and never once mentioned the inheritance affecting Medicare. Apparently, under some circumstances, when you are enrolled in Medicare, an inheritance will cause your Part B premiums to skyrocket. I have also gotten contradictory information about that from my local social services Medicaid Supervisor, and my local SSA office phone rep.

My most urgent question right now is: when will I start receiving Medicare, and therefore what tax return will Medicare look back to to determine my premiums. Apparently, Medicare has a 2-year lookback rule, but I am not sure how it is applied. Even though I will receive my inheritance this month (1/24,) I'm pretty sure the distribution will go on my 2023 1040 (because my family's trust lawyer is using the 65 day rule.)

I understand that Medicare has different procedures for enrolling people: Social Security rep told me that if I am still receiving Social Security 4 months before I turn 65, then I will be automatically enrolled in Medicare to start the month I turn 65 in 2025. In this scenario, the lookback would be to my 2023 1040 (which will show the inheritance.)

In contrast, the Medicaid supervisor told me that since SSA still has me classified as disabled, that I will fall under the Medicare enrollment rules for people on SSDI: When I told her that I had never been on SSDI, she said yes, but that I am on Social Security Disability, because of my disabled status. People on SSDI, and according to the Medicaid supervisor, disabled people like me, who were once on SSI, but who were forced to take Social Security at 62, are automatically enrolled in Medicare 24 months after they receive their first SSDI payment. In January of 2023, I received my last SSI payment. I February of 2023, I received my first Social Security payment. This means I would automatically be enrolled in Medicare in February of 2025. In this scenario, the lookback will also be to my 2023 tax return, which shows the inheritance.

Which of these is true? When will I actually receive Medicare. Will I be enrolled automatically? Is there any way, I can decline Medicare at 65 when offered it, and apply a year later in 2026, so that the lookback will to 2024, when I will only have my low Social Security payments? I understand there is a penalty for this. What is it? Is there any other way to get around my inheritance affecting my premiums? Go back to work? (Don't know how I would do that.) Set up the SNT?

Seems unfair to classify my inheritance as income. It is going to increase my income dramatically, for just that one year. I have fallen into a very low income category ever since I have been unable to work, and that one year of bounce, just happens to be, as far as I can tell, my 2 year lookback for Medicare. And I have no control over when I received my inheritance.

I so greatly appreciate anyone who has been willing to read through this far, and who has attempted to wade through this infuriating complexity. You'd think that hiring a lawyer would suffice to help me lay out these scenarios. The Medicaid supervisor said that I shouldn't bother looking for another lawyer, as they don't know the rules. She says they call Social Services every day, to try to get answers for their clients."

Trippy 0.9.0 Release,rust,18bexd5,2023-12-05 10:49:35,23,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18bexd5/trippy_090_release/,FujiApple852,,"[Trippy 0.9.0](https://preview.redd.it/mu8in2nnag4c1.png?width=1688&format=png&auto=webp&s=841bc1419a8868ac4d261671052e6c26f6917254)

Trippy `0.9.0` has been released.

As a [reminder](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/13j756x/media_introducing_trippy_a_network_diagnostic_tool/), Trippy combines the functionality of `traceroute` and `ping` and is designed to assist with the analysis of networking issues. You can think of it as a modern, [cross platform](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#distributions), Rust based version of tools such as [mtr](https://github.com/traviscross/mtr), with a bunch of advanced [features](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#features) and a fancy TUI.

New features in `0.9.0` include:

* **Tracing flows**: breakdown complex UDP/TCP [ECMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing) traces into individual flows (i.e. common network path); render a chart of flows in [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) format ([example](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/blob/master/assets/0.9.0/dot.png))
* **ICMP extensions**: parse and display generic [ICMP extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4884) with specific support for MPLS
* **Additional Paris tracing strategy**: now supports IPv6/UDP
* **Unprivileged mode**: run without requiring root privileges (macOS only for now, Linux later)
* **Hop privacy**: hide sensitive ip/host/GeoIp details for some hops
* **DNS resolve all**: simultaneously trace all IPs resolved from a given hostname

See the release note for full details of these and other changes.

Happy tracing!"

SNT-TC-1A: How do the hours work?,nondestructivetesting,16grnnn,2023-09-12 09:39:05,2,0.75,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nondestructivetesting/comments/16grnnn/snttc1a_how_do_the_hours_work/,ChizMaNiz,,"  

Got a bit of a dumb question for you all. I work in QA engineering at a nuclear component facility, and one of our QA engineering folks quit. Unfortunately, he oversaw personnel qualifications for quality control.

With his departure, we’re trying to determine how NDT hours work for SNT-TC-1A.

Say if one of our level I guys was pursuing level II magnetic particle training. SNT-TC-1A states that you need 210 hours of experience in the method and 400 hours total in NDT. Now, does this mean the inspector needs 610 hours of experience in addition to their level I hours to achieve level II status (total of 810 hours), or do the level I hours count toward the total hours needed for level II?

Also, do the hours in experience in the method count towards the total hours in NDT required? For instance, if they achieve the 210 hours of experience in the method, do they only need 190 more hours in this or any other NDT method?

I appreciate the help. I have limited experience when it comes to this sort of stuff."

Can you clarify the situation with ban at a discord, there are several friends who also received, for all the time I wrote only one message ""hello everyone"" or is it considered spam, I just wanted to say hello it was once. I will be very grateful for an answer. because I really like your project, not so long ago I managed to get access, and I'm just delighted with the game. But one-way communication is very annoying.

as far as I understand, a lot of bans were issued

Why has Springdale not adopted it?"
