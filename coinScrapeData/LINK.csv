Suggestion: Link Styles,Supernote,1i9tcpz,2025-01-25 13:24:41,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/1i9tcpz/suggestion_link_styles/,Cyniclinical,Suggestion,"Hello, I have a small suggestion related to in-note hyperlinks.

TLDR - Add a ""blank"" link-style that does not include any visual indications that the text is a link (no chainlink icon, underlines, or borders).
-----

Context:

Currently, when creating a link, we have a choice between three 'styles' to display the link - Underlined, solid rectangular border, and dashed rectangular border. All three styles also display the small ""chainlink"" icon at the lower-right corner of the final object.

Due to the way these objects are created, the boundaries can extend well beyond the main body of text - For example, a lowercase ""y"" with an extended tail results in the underline and the icon being placed awkwardly away from the main text.

In addition, there are simply spots in a lot of my notes where having any of these visual indications kinda ruins the appearance of my page - An example being yearly calendars. I usually link the month names to respective pages that bookmark, say, page 40 when my February entries start.

Another example is, of course, a dedicated index page (eg, the Bullet Journal framework), which is just a list of links that doesn't warrant the extra clutter of lines and icons.

I have a sort of default mentality knowing that I would have naturally linked certain headers or points in a page, and don't need a visual indicator reminding me of such.

I hope this makes sense, and thank you for taking the time to read."

I know that both Big A and most of the fanbase aren’t big on crypto, but I’ve been a crypto bro since 2020, and I genuinely believe crypto will outperform most other assets. This isn’t meant to be anything hateful or contrarian—I've been watching Big A for years, and while we don’t see eye to eye on crypto, we agree on pretty much everything else.

That said, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is, if Big A ""The Glizzlord"" Atrioc is down, I am willing to bet $1000 for charity. I followed the same rules as everyone else and built my own portfolio based on the competition format:

* $1,000 per pick ($10,000 total)
* 10 picks total
* Bought on January 23rd after I saw the VOD (Europe frog here)

# How to Optimize Your Crypto Investments

1. **Conduct thorough research:** Understand the fundamentals of each project and its long-term potential.
2. **Diversify your portfolio:** Spread investments across multiple assets to minimize risk.
3. **Set realistic targets:** Plan your entry, exit strategies, and use stop-loss mechanisms to manage downside risk.
4. **Stay informed:** Keep track of market updates and trends that could impact your portfolio.
5. **Adopt a long-term mindset:** Success in crypto often requires patience and a focus on future growth rather than quick wins.

Chainlink (LINK) Continues Bullish Streak with BX Digital and BX Swizz Partnerships,ethtrader,1i87bs8,2025-01-23 11:29:51,9,0.85,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i87bs8/chainlink_link_continues_bullish_streak_with_bx/,kirtash93,Discussion,"And another partnership for Chainlink as they shared in their Twitter account in the following [tweet](https://x.com/chainlink/status/1882414346661200375).

This tweet specifically talks about Chainlinks partnering with BX Digital and BX Swiss which are both subsidiaries of Boerse Stuttgart, a quite important exchange group in Europe. The collaboration goal is to bring real world financial data onto the blockchain, the perfect job for our beloved Chainlink.

https://preview.redd.it/d4sistts6ree1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f741615052a5b134d4d82a06fc85c08f0e0e81

Chainlink will ensure that data feeds are reliable and secure to power tokenized equities on the BX Swiss platform meaning that real time and historical security closing price data will be integrated into blockchain apps.

This partnership is another step forward for Chainlink and in the end the whole blockchain industry reducing the distance between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. For link this is quite bullish because LINK adoption keeps increasing and now in European financial markets, it also shows that big companies trust Chainlink and consequently Ethereum and it also shows that crypto will be everywhere without even noticing.

But this is not all to be bullish with Chainlink, you should really check their [Twitter account](https://x.com/chainlink) and check the amount of partnerships and adoption it is having.

You can find more information about this partnership here: [https://bxdigital.ch/en/bx-digital-and-bx-swiss-partner-with-chainlink-to-bring-pricing-data-onchain/](https://bxdigital.ch/en/bx-digital-and-bx-swiss-partner-with-chainlink-to-bring-pricing-data-onchain/)

Advice: Only focus your eyes on price action to decide when to buy or sell but always focus your eyes on the project adoption, support, partnerships and developments.

**What you should know:**

At the time of writing LINK is trading at $24.61. 

From the graph above the green area is representative of the 80% holders that are in profit. Those are investors holding their LINK tokens at a price above what they paid for them.

Conversely, the red area represents holders that are in loss because they are holding LINK at a price below their purchase price.

There are a number of metrics and developments that lend credence or support IntoTheBlock data of Link holders in profit.

To start with, at least $20M worth LINK was[ withdrawn from exchanges](https://coinfomania.com/chainlink-link-surges-toward-35-after-massive-20m-token-exodus/) this week, driving bullish momentum with speculation of LINK hitting $35.

On Monday, the DeFi project of US President Donald Trump [acquired 220,000 LINK tokens](https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:a2bb00011094b:0-link-price-soars-40-after-trump-s-crypto-venture-purchases-220-000-tokens-in-15-minutes/) for a whooping $5.63 million.

Also, [as banks eye crypto payment opportunities](https://decrypt.co/302045/bank-america-ceo-banking-industry-ready-crypto) under Trump, there are  speculations on which cryptocurrency might lead the charge with LINK identified as the dark horse in the race.

Although XRP excels in speed and cost-effectiveness for cross-border payments, Chainlink's broader utility in providing secure, reliable, and scalable data feeds across different ecosystems might make it more versatile for banks looking to integrate blockchain technology into various aspects of their operations  beyond just payments."

I'm reaching out here because I'm facing a serious issue with my account verification, and I'm getting no response through regular support channels.

I recently deposited 100k USDC into my Kraken account, and shortly after, I was requested to complete a POSOF (Proof of Source of Funds) verification. I promptly provided the necessary documentation, tracing my funds back to their origin.

To give some context, I initially bought Chainlink (LINK) back in 2018, but since LINK wasn’t listed on Kraken at the time, I purchased it via Binance. Before that, I had funded my Kraken account from my bank, purchasing ETH and BTC directly on your platform, and later transferred the funds to Binance to buy LINK.

Despite submitting all the requested information, including bank statements, it's been a week now without any response from Kraken Support. I've sent two follow-up emails, but I'm still unable to access or use my funds, which is very concerning.

I've always trusted Kraken for its professionalism and reliability over the years, which is why this situation is extremely stressful and disappointing. I'm hoping someone here can escalate my case or provide some guidance on what to do next.

"Trump's DeFi project buys $25 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, TRON, AAVE and ENA",CapitalistExploits,1i7rxrx,2025-01-22 20:30:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7rxrx/trumps_defi_project_buys_25_million_worth_of/,kayakero,,"US President-elect Donald Trump, through his DeFi project **World Liberty Financial (WLFI)**, recently made a major operation in the cryptocurrency market.

WLFI acquired approximately $24.6 million worth of altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ENA).

According to data from the Arkham platform, the WLFI treasury converted around $24.6 million of the USDC stablecoin into these cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, the project purchased $4.7 million of each token, except for Ethena, with an investment of $2.3 million. These acquisitions reflect a strategy of diversifying WLFI's assets, moving away from stablecoins and betting on more speculative tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/s8c1vuawzbee1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f44f66ad53ab2802224412643353f55c252788

# Trump's crypto project

Currently, WLFI has a diversified portfolio, with the largest holding of **43,000 ETH**, valued at approximately **$143 million** , representing the largest stake. Additionally, it holds **$96 million in Tether (USDT)** and **$56 million in USD Coin (USDC)**.

Other assets include nearly **$6.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, Aave and Chainlink** , **$4.6 million in Tron** and **$3 million in Ethena**.

>Also, WLFI added memecoins to its portfolio, purchasing Hoppy (""Pepe's friend""), and interestingly Pulsechain  (PLS), Richard Heart token is part of the holdings.

It is important to note that despite the recent launch of Trump's official memecoin, **$TRUMP, which generated $25 billion** in revenue in 24 hours, WLFI did not acquire any tokens of this cryptocurrency.

In November, Tron founder Justin Sun invested **$30 million** in WLFI tokens and was quickly appointed as an advisor to the project.

Recently, WLFI sold close to **$10 million worth of WBTC tokens** days before the presidential inauguration. This move sparked speculation, although WLFI stated that these transactions are part of its regular asset management.

The WLFI wallet also saw significant deposits in Ethereum and USDT. Despite the controversies and with a total value estimated at over **$17 million** , the project remains open and is looking to raise **$300 million** by selling **20 billion WLFI tokens**.

This precedent may attract new investors, increase legitimacy for the industry, and encourage the development of favorable regulations. However, such initiatives bring risks as well.

Whales Invest $20M in Chainlink (LINK) Following Trump’s Inauguration,draqai,1i6t71q,2025-01-21 16:01:25,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i6t71q/whales_invest_20m_in_chainlink_link_following/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Chainlink Whales Just Got Hungry for $LINK!  

Hey babes, did you see what just went down in the crypto world? The Chainlink ($LINK) whales have been feasting—snapping up a massive 770K $LINK tokens worth nearly $19.5M in the last 24 hours. Umm, flex much? This spicy move followed Donald Trump’s $4.7M investment in $LINK, showing it’s not just meme coins like $DOGE or $SHIB catching the big players' eyes anymore.  

But even with all this juicy whale action, $LINK's price has been a little stubborn, sitting around $25.70, down 2.5% in the past day. Sounds like the market’s still vibing out its next move, right? Meanwhile, the trading volume also took a little breather, dipping by 44%. Classic market “calm before the storm” feels.  

💹 What’s Next for $LINK?  
According to technical analysis (ugh, the nerdy stuff we secretly love), $LINK is channeling major bullish Cup and Handle vibes. If it manages to break above $26.40, watch out because we could see a juicy rally toward that dreamy $38.50 mark. With an RSI of 52, this baby’s got room to climb. But traders seem divided! Long/Short data shows slight bearish vibes, sitting at 0.92, with mixed bets on whether $LINK will rise or fall next. Drama much?  

⏳ So what does this mean for us cryptoholics? Investors are in accumulation mode, while traders are playing the waiting game. It's giving us serious suspense vibes. Should we call it the ""Netflix series of crypto""? Let’s see if this consolidation is just the appetizer for a main course of gains.  

Don’t sleep on this one though. Chainlink’s got those big players watching. Feathers ruffled yet, $BTC and $ETH? You should be.

""Despite his best efforts, it was Tyler who got the boot, but he got to go home with a glow in the dark girlfriend by his side. Adios Klutztista!""

""Who will be the next Hurl? And how will we injure them beforehand? Find out the answers to these questions and more, right now, right here, on Total! Drama! Revenge, of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The episode opened to a small pink bird singing happily on a tree branch...until a thick purple tentacle rose up and flicked it away. An air raid siren began to sound, the camera zooming out to show the squid-tree looking around in alarm.

The shot cut over to Chris on the roof of the Maggots' cabin, wearing an old war helmet and cranking the siren with a smile. The shot pulled back to show the six campers stepping out into the common area to investigate – Noah and Shawn from the Rats' cabin, Emma and Lindsay from the Maggots' cabin, and Alejandro and Axel in-between.

""Gooooooood morning, campers!"" Chris greeted, allowing the siren's wail to peter off. ""Today we have a very special treat.""

""Actual food?"" Noah asked dryly.

""Trip to the mall?"" Lindsay added with an excited gasp.

""A soccer game?"" Alejandro finished eagerly.

""Nope! It's merge day!"" Chris told them. ""No more Team Rat, no more Team Maggot!"" He jumped off the roof, and landed with a grunt. ""From now on,"" he said as he walked over to the former Toxic Rats, ""it's every man and woman for themselves."" Emma raised an eyebrow and smiled, while Axel and Alejandro shared a glance and Shawn looked rather nervous.

Confessional: Axel

""The merge,"" Axel mused while sitting to the side of the confessional. ""About time! Working on two teams has been a hassle. Shawn's been pretty useful,"" she added as an aside. ""I'll keep him for a little while longer and then boot him out when he's not expecting it.""

Confessional Ends

The footage cut back to the steps of the former Rats' cabin, the host taking out a walkie talkie. ""Chef!"" he called into it, the scene cutting to a close-up of the cook in the pilot's seat of what sounded like a helicopter. ""Drop it like it's hot!"" the host ordered, prompting Chef to grin and press a button on the control stick.

The shot cut outward a ways to reveal that the helicopter was carrying a truly gigantic block of concrete, which was promptly dropped. Down below, Lindsay and Emma screamed and ran away from their former home, and Shawn and Noah cringed and threw up their arms to shield themselves from the shower of splintered wood sent their way by the impact.

""Did you seriously just crush our cabin with a block of solid concrete?!"" Emma yelled angrily back at Chris, the shot cutting back to show her and Lindsay lying on the ground in front of their ruined cabin and concrete block.

""I had a bunch left over from building a monument to myself,"" Chris explained with a cheeky smile. ""I call it, 'Mount Chrismore'!"" The camera cut over to, and slowly zoomed in towards, a massive fake mountain in the shape of Chris' head.

A small squeak of a fart accompanied a bit of bird poop landed on the edge of Mount Chrismore's left eye. The shot panned up to the culprits: a pair of rattle-gulls squawking with laughter on top the concrete head, high-winging each other with congratulatory glee.

""From now on,"" Chris told the cast now standing by the lone remaining building in shot, unaware of his project's defilement, ""you'll all share one tiny, cruddy, cabin.""

""But all our stuff was in there!"" Lindsay protested.

""Yes,"" Chris replied mirthfully, ""and because I am nice, and not heartless, I'll help you get it out."" Emma and Lindsay smiled hopefully, and the shot cut to a close-up of a pickaxe. ""One McLean brand Pickaxe,"" Chris said as the pickaxe head gleamed, and the camera pulled back to show that the tool was about the size of a pencil. ""Children's size."" He flicked it over to the campers as the helicopter approached, and based on the high-pitched cry of pain that followed, it had hit Lindsay. Sure enough, the shot cut to Emma holding the minuscule tool while the dumb blonde rubbed her sore forehead.

""Later, taters!"" Chris told them, grabbing on to the helicopter's hanging rope ladder and laughing as he was lifted up and flown off. The helicopter was flying low enough, however, that he ended up slamming into the top of the block of concrete he'd had dropped, and yelped in pain. ""Chef!"" he yelled angrily as the helicopter flew off with him.

Noah snickered as he and Shawn watched from the sidelines as the Maggots tried to reclaim their belongings off-screen. ""Good thing that wasn't our cabin.""

""You might not want to help, but I am feeling charitable today,"" Shawn told him, walking forward and leaving his former teammate to shrug and walk.

Confessional: Shawn

""I haven't been a Maggot ever since the third episode,"" Shawn told the camera. ""But they do need help, and I can't leave my old team to dry like that!""

Confessional Ends

The scene moved to the broken roof of the destroyed cabin, where Emma was fruitlessly trying to break through the shingles with the pathetically small pickaxe she'd been given. ""No, no, no,"" she moaned after a few grunting swings, sitting back on her legs. ""My magazines were in there!""

""Maybe you'd have better luck in another part of the rubble,"" Shawn suggested, the shot pulling out to show him standing nearby...and that the section of the roof Emma had been trying to break through was propped up against the concrete block with nothing but air below it.

""Oh...,"" Emma said, looking down in embarrassment. ""That's probably a good idea."" She slid down off the roof next to her old teammate, who was now looking around.

""Shouldn't Axel and Al be helping?"" Shawn asked. ""They did live here at one point.""

""Well Axel would rather help herself, but Alejandro's right over there,"" Emma said, pointing forward. The camera quick-panned over to the other side of the rubble, where Alejandro was standing on the remains of the lower part of the roof, prying a part of the wall away from the concrete block with his hands.

Confessional: Alejandro

""At last, I am now on my own,"" Alejandro told the confessional. ""I remember having a guys alliance with Noah and Tyler, and even though Tyler is gone now, I can still put Noah to good use.""

Confessional Ends

The focus moved back to Shawn and Emma. ""Soo, do you find anything suspicious about Alejandro?"" Shawn asked.

“Nope. He's been pretty sweet and a capable leader,” Emma said. “Why are you asking?”

“It's just that he's so mysterious,” Shawn said. “He could be hiding something.”

“Like that he's a robot?” Emma joked and laughed for a bit.

""Not funny,"" Shawn scolded. ""Robots could take over the world someday!""

“Alright. I was just kidding,” Emma apologized. “Hey, since the teams are now disbanded, do you want to form an alliance?”

""What about Lindsay?"" Shawn asked. ""I thought you two were-""

""Friends? Yeah, we are,"" Emma nodded, leading the conspiracy nut over to what had once been the side railing of the Maggot cabin. ""I was going to say that we could get her in on it too.""

""Lindsay's okay, even if she's not the brightest,"" Shawn said. ""But I'll have to pass on the alliance offer.""

“How come?” Emma asked in a disappointed tone.

""I'm more of a solo guy, but I wouldn't be against helping you out if you need it,"" Shawn answered.

“Okay, but let me know if you change your mind,” Emma replied.

Confessional: Shawn

""The last time I talked to Emma was in the night challenge,"" Shawn confessed. ""She told me that she didn't vote for me, and while I did deserve to go home there for losing the challenge and this show is serious business, I'm kinda touched by that.""

""I usually don't trust anybody but myself, but Emma's the closest person I can rely on right now,"" he added thoughtfully. ""As long as she's not an alien, I can get along with her.""

Confessional Ends

The static cut away to Lindsay and Noah pulling a blanket out from under the ruined steps. ""Thanks for helping, Nolan,"" the dumb blonde said.

“My name is Noah!” the bookworm emphasized. “And I'm only helping you because I don't want to feel like the odd one out since I'm the only one who's never been on the Maggots.”

A grunt drew their attention upwards, the camera pulling back to show Alejandro jumping down from the low section of the former roof. ""It's an honor for all of us to have made it this far,"" he said.

""Tell me something new,"" Noah told him as Lindsay continued pulling the blanket. ""I always knew that I would merge with my brainpower and not screwing up in the challenges!""

Alejandro rolled his eyes at that part, but carried on. ""Anyway, with us not being separated anymore, shall we continue our alliance?"" he asked.

“Who else would I ally with?” Noah nodded. “Now let's continue helping out with the mess.”

""Challenge tii~iime!"" Chris announced as the scene moved to the space between the communal bathrooms and the main lodge, where the six campers had gathered before the host and a widescreen television cart. ""Today, it's all about grabbin' 'em and taggin' 'em,"" Chris explained as the camera panned across Alejandro, Noah, Shawn, Emma, Lindsay, and Axel. ""And to show you how it's done, I give you Total Drama's favorite hacker girl, MK.""

The techno, strapped to a hand truck with a mask covering the lower half of her face, was wheeled over by Chef. ""MK owes me some camera time for skipping out on Total Drama World Tour,"" Chris explained, ""so, I saved an extra-painful challenge demo just for her.""

""Hope you get a hangnail, McLean,"" MK spat.

""No, my nails are perfectly filed thanks to Dakota,"" Chris corrected with a grin. ""First up, the 'Smash and Grab'."" The shot cut over to the television as it switched from static to a feed of the kitchen. ""Hidden somewhere in the mess hall kitchen are six keys to Chef's prized collection of vintage go-karts."" The feed cut to the karts in question, sitting outdoors in an area walled off by wooden planks. A single chain link gate served as an entrance point, with a barbed wire-lined sign displaying an image of a go-kart above it. Another pile of the island's ever-present toxic waste barrels could be seen just beyond the wall.

""Some drive like well-oiled machines,"" the host continued as a kart was shown in close-up against a brilliant orange background, its engine whirring and its wheels spinning. ""Others...,"" the go-kart's wheels suddenly broke off, ""...not so much.""

""Chris!"" Chef interrupted angrily, moving the scene back to them and MK. ""Don't let these clowns drive my karts! They're gonna smash 'em!""

""Yes,"" Chris answered in a condescending manner, ""and car crashes equals ratings. Demo time, MK! Chef,"" the hulking man reluctantly stepped towards the hand truck, ""let this perp out on a day pass.""

Chef untied the girl's bonds, and the moment they fell away, she discarded her mask and ran off with a cry of ""Later McCheapskate!"" She started cackling, and the two adults shared an awkward look.

""Okayyyy...probably shoulda seen that coming...,"" Chris admitted. Chef nodded.

Axel snorted in an unimpressed manner as the camera cut over to her and Lindsay. ""Searching a kitchen? Go-kart racing? Aren't challenges supposed to be challenging?""

""I'm just glad that this challenge doesn't involve us doing something that will kill us,"" Lindsay looked over at her.

“Getting that out of the way,"" Axel replied, ""I think you and me should work together.""

""Why should I do that?"" Lindsay asked.

""Because we're both in danger, and if we're not careful, they'll pick us off one by one,"" Axel admitted. “I know your type as a blonde bombshell, but with me by your side, I can make you stronger. What do you say?”

Lindsay thought about it for a while, but said “I don't want an alliance with you now, but let's just do the challenge together so I can tell that I can trust you.”

Confessional: Axel

""Shawn's obviously going to work solo, and though I plan to do the same, I'll have to keep Lindsay in the game so that the stronger players like Alejandro can go home and I can whoop Lindsay any day of the year,"" Axel confessed.

Confessional Ends

Chris was now standing on the mess hall's front porch, just to the side of the stairs, while the campers were lined up on the ground nearby. ""Players!"" the host said, raising his hand and prompting the six to get into running positions. ""Commence smashing and/or grabbing...now!"" He waved his hand down, and the footage flashed ahead.

""A key, a key...,"" Noah told himself as he dashed over to a shelf near the walk-in freezer. ""Where would Chris hide a key?"" He lifted the lid of a jar only to find it empty, then checked a salt shaker by turning it over. The lid fell off, dumping a pile of salt onto the shelf, and Noah gasped. ""It could be in the salt,"" he said, quickly throwing a bunch of salt over his right shoulder. The camera followed it as it hit an unsuspecting Shawn in the eye as he casually looked in Noah's direction.

“Hey!” Shawn grunted in pain then glared at the bookworm while holding his eye.

""My mistake,"" Noah said casually.

The focus moved over to Axel and Lindsay as they approached a tall cabinet. ""Ready to find a key?"" Axel asked.

""I guess,"" Lindsay said, bending down and opening one of the bottom cupboards. She looked around a little, then frowned and stood up. ""No keys in there.""

""Oh well,"" Axel shrugged. ""Like you said, at least this challenge isn't dangerous.""

She closed the cupboard door, revealing that a giant cockroach was now standing on her arm. ""And I spoke too soon,"" she said nervously before the mutant launched itself onto Lindsay's face, the blonde girl immediately screaming.

The camera moved back to Shawn and his reddened right eye, bending down and reaching under the room's central table. He pulled out a bag of peanuts. “Peanuts? Not the key, but I'll keep them,” he said and put them in his pocket before putting his arm under the cloth.

The camera cut under the cloth, showing his hand now close to another giant roach, this one sitting on top a pile of grubby pots and discarded soda cans. The roach licked its mandibles, dashed a bit of salt on the boy's hand, then opened wide...

The shot cut back outside the tablecloth as Shawn grunted in pain.

Just to the right of the sink, Noah was searching through some more shelves as Alejandro walked up to him. ""Key... key... key...,"" the snarker muttered as he looked from one box or bag or bottle to the next.

""Having trouble, amigo?"" Alejandro asked with an uncharacteristic concern.

""Huh?"" Noah said, setting down a small pan and turning around to face him. ""Oh, yeah. I'm trying to find that key so that I won't be the designated merge boot, Al.""

""I don't want that to happen as well,"" Alejandro lied, briefly looking away and shuddering.

""Hey, have you thought about recruiting Shawn into our alliance?"" Noah asked as he turned back and started searching the shelves again. ""Not only are we the only three guys left, but I don't think he'd trust the girls more since he's been with the Rats more than the Maggots.""

""Shawn has a connection with Emma if the fourth episode wasn't evident enough,"" Alejandro said. ""How do you know that he wouldn't just align with her instead?""

Noah turned towards a door next to the sink. ""Because he likes to win, and friendship is a second to third priority for him.""

""I'll consider it,"" Alejandro said, ""and come to a decision after the day is over.""

As Noah opened the door, the camera cut inside to reveal it as a broom closet. As soon as he looked inside, however, yet another giant roach jumped out and latched onto his face, knocking him over with a grunt. Alejandro winced, leaning over and looking down at the fallen young man.

The focus moved to Emma next as she crouched down in front of a bucket of water on the other side of the sink. ""Well, I might as well check it,"" she said, reaching in but almost immediately yelping in pain and pulling her arm back out. A thin, insectile arm rose out of the water and grasped at her as she rubbed her hand. ""Uh oh,"" she moaned just before her arm was pulled into the water.

Her grimace of pain quickly intensified as whatever lurked inside the bucket bit her. She screamed and tried to withdraw her hand again, but it was stuck and all she managed was to slop some water onto the floor.

The camera panned back over to Noah and Alejandro, the former of which was looking in the direction of Emma's screams while the latter tossed the roach that had attacked Noah back into the broom closet and slammed the door. ""Maybe you should help her,"" Noah suggested.

Alejandro walked off to the right as he spoke, and returned shortly carrying a stained and fly-ridden bag of garbage. ""Alright. And while I'm helping that senorita, you can search through this."" He thrust the bag in Noah's hands and dashed off to the left.

Noah opened the bag and immediately wretched. The bookworm quickly held his breath and dove in.

Confessional: Noah

""Do I have any concerns about being in an alliance with Alejandro?"" Noah asked the outhouse rhetorically. ""No. See, I figured that he's an eel dipped in tartar sauce after analyzing his actions. He shivers whenever someone calls him Al, he takes charge in planning the past eliminations like Dawn and Mike, and he created the alliance with me and Tyler just to further himself in the game. I'm only sticking with him so that I can get him eliminated without him knowing.""

Confessional Ends

The scene moved back to Lindsay and Axel, the blonde running around with a mutant cockroach latched to her face while the survivalist looked on in contempt. Eventually, she rolled her eyes, then held out her fist so that Lindsay ran into it face-first. Lindsay fell onto her back, and the roach rolled off her with a pained hiss to accompany the dumb blonde's pained groan.

""If you're done,"" Axel ordered as Lindsay started to get back to her feet, ""go back and see if you can find me a key.""

""And you're gonna help me get a key after. Right?"" Lindsay asked.

""Yeah,"" Axel said dismissively.

Lindsay stepped back over to the cabinet she'd been searching, and climbed to the top of it and felt around. After a second, she smiled. ""Got one!"" she declared, pulling her arm back and holding up a key. She hopped down and handed it to Axel. ""Now help me get a key.""

Confessional: Axel

""Of course I'm going to help her,"" Axel asked the outhouse camera. ""I need both of us to stay in the game, and ditching her now is gonna make me look bad.""

Confessional Ends

""This is for trying to eat my arm!"" Emma yelled at the bucket as she thrust a mop into it over and over. She relented after a second, withdrawing the mop so that a rather battered mutant cockroach could emerge and weakly spit up a key into her waiting hands. ""Yes!"" she said, excitedly pumping her fist.

The focus moved back to Axel as she rooted around in a garbage can. After a second, she smiled and pulled her now-grimy arm out with a smile and held up a key. ""Finally!"" she said and tossed the key to an eager Lindsay.

Another cut took the scene back to the central table, which rocked and shook before, finally, Shawn was tossed back out into the open looking rather the worse for wear. He grinned, and held up his own key. “That roach sure is scrappy.”

""Llave..,"" Alejandro muttered as the shot cut back to him rooting through the garbage bag, ""I know you're in here somewhere...yes!"" He exclaimed brightly, and laughed as he pulled a key out. ""I finally found one!"" he told Noah, the camera panning over to show him searching through the same shelves he had been looking through earlier.

""It's gold!"" Noah said in awe as the shot zoomed in on Alejandro's key, a radiant background appearing to emphasize its color.

""I know. Just like my chances of winning,"" Alejandro said smugly.

Noah picked up the lid of a large cookie jar and stuck his hand in it. A second later, he smiled and withdrew a key of his own, and grinned at Alejandro.

The scene flashed outside, where Chris and Chef were walking away from the mess hall. ""You let them trash my kitchen?!"" Chef asked the host in disbelief, both men stopping in their tracks. ""Chris, man. Do you know how long that's gonna take to clean up?""

""Buudddyyy,"" Chris replied, his tone more condescending than placating. ""Brother from another mother! Relax, it's cool. See?"" he ran over and thrust a mop into his assistant's arms. ""I got you a new mop!""

As he walked away, the shot lingered on Chef as he growled and snapped the mop.

Another flash took the scene outside the patchwork wall of Chef's go-kart pen, a flashing red neon light in the shape of the man's head affixed to the board above the chainlink entrance. ""Say hello to challenge part deux!"" Chris said over the zooming shot before the camera cut to him and the six campers just inside the compound, a light but tense score beginning in the background. Each contestant was holding some kind of yellow electronic tablet, as well as a can of spray paint – Shawn with black, Axel with green, Alejandro with red, Lindsay with pink, Noah with blue, and Emma with purple.

""Grand Chef Auto!"" the host continued. ""You've each been given a can of spray paint and a GPS map of the island. Your mission?"" he said with a sly look as the shot cut to Noah. ""Race your go-karts around the island and be the first to graffiti tag three landmarks,"" the host explained as the shot cut to a close-up of Noah's GPS, showing a topographic map with three blinking lights arranged in a wide triangle.

""The rock wall of Mount Looming Tragedy,"" Chris said as the shot cut to the looming tragedy they'd been forced to scale in the third episode. ""The spooky tree in the haunted forest,"" the squid-tree was shown next, its eyeball and tentacles tucked away out of sight. ""And, the tippy-top of a giant totem pole,"" the host finished as the camera panned up the camp's slightly goofy-looking totem pole.

""Oh, and the go-karts?"" Chris added as the shot cut over to Chef standing in front of the go-karts and looking around irritably. ""You'll have to steal them. From Chef."" The camera suddenly zoomed in on the hulking man, who growled.

Shawn gulped.

""The first player to completely tag all three landmarks wins immunity,"" Chris explained. ""And,"" the shot began to zoom across the variously stubborn, determined, and nervous faces of the campers, ""they get to choose who will be eliminated. Haha, alright,"" he said jovially as the camera reached the end of the line and cut back to him. ""Aaaand, go!""

The scene flashed to a close-up of Chef as he looked from side to side as the perspective moved behind his shoulders to show the six campers standing their ground.

""So Chef's gonna stare us to death,"" Noah said in his usual sarcastic tone. ""What a shocker,"" he snarked to Emma. The camera cut back to Chef's close-up as he narrowed his eyes.

""Nobody touches my stuff,"" he said softly. The shot cut to his mouth alone, as he repeated ""Nobody.""

With a snap of his fingers, the angry chittering of a veritable army of hairless mutant squirrels rose up from behind, within, and in front of the go-karts. Lindsay gasped, as did Noah, and Alejandro cried ""Laser squirrels!""

The eyes of three squirrels sitting on a single kart turned red and fired off their trademark eye lasers, and swept their gazes across the yard at the unseen, but screaming, campers.

The shot suddenly cut to Chris, lounging in a yard chair with his feet propped up on a stack of tires. ""I love it when Chef gets mad, don't you?"" he asked the camera with a smile as the campers continued to scream. ""Who will survive his wrath?"" he asked. ""Find out after the break, right here, on Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!""

(Commercial Break)

The campers were still running and screaming under fire from the pack of laser squirrels as the episode resumed, the dramatic score resuming with it. Axel and Lindsay soon found themselves running into a corner between the wall and a stack of tires, and Chef quickly came up behind them with a gleeful cackle. ""Game over,"" he told them. ""You're comin' with me.""

Elsewhere, the rodent horde decided to abandon the safety of the go-karts to bring the assault to the humans.

""They’re in my hair!"" Emma exclaimed as she tried to pull a squirrel out of her hair.

""Try and shake them off!"" Noah said, stopping in place upon hearing the preppy girl's cry.

""Come on!"" Alejandro told Noah. ""We have to grab our go-karts!"" The boys ran past Shawn, who was struggling with a squirrel biting each arm and leg.

""Get off me already!"" Shawn yelled in irritation. ""You can have these nuts if they'll keep you away!"" he added, taking out the bag of peanuts he'd found in the kitchen earlier.

Immediately, a radiant background appeared behind the peanuts and the eyes of every squirrel turned to them – even the ones still gnawing on Emma's head. ""Now go fetch!"" Shawn told them, throwing the bag away as far as he could.

It hit Axel in the head as she and Lindsay were forcibly escorted forward by Chef. ""What the?"" the survivalist said in confusion as Lindsay took the bag off her hair, and the three looked behind them and gasped, running off while being pursued by the naked swarm.

Shawn hopped into a kart as the shot cut back to him. He turned the key, revved the engine, and took off with an unexpected burst of speed. The camera followed him a little ways, but lingered on Alejandro as he watched the conspiracy nut speed past from the seat of a golden go-kart.

""I should hurry up,"" Alejandro said, taking the gold key out of his pants. ""This gold key should suffice,"" he said, putting it into the ignition with a smile. He pressed down on the gas and the wheels began to spin and squeal, but for some reason, he wasn't going anywhere. He frowned in confusion, then the shot zoomed out to reveal that his kart was missing its front wheels, the bare axles propped up on cinder blocks. ""It was too good to be true.""

""See you later!"" Emma cheered as she passed by him in her kart.

""Before you ask,"" Chris answered, leaning in with an impish smile as Noah also arrived, ""no take-backs on karts. Especially the bad ones."" He leaned away, and the camera focused in on the arch villain and the bookworm.

""I'll tow you to the finish,"" Noah said.

""You'd do that?"" Alejandro asked.

""If one of us wins, we can protect ourselves and send another camper packing,"" Noah stated. ""And you'll lose if you're just standing there.""

""You're correct,"" Alejandro agreed. ""I accept your offer!""

The scene flashed to Alejandro's kart tied to Noah's, and Noah drove off.

Confessional: Alejandro

“He thinks this alliance is legitimate,” Alejandro snorted. “And I thought Noah was wiser than that.”

Confessional: Noah

“Alejandro is so overconfident, he doesn’t even realize that I’m plotting his own elimination,” Noah snickered.

Confessionals End

The scene cut to Lindsay and Axel behind the iron-barred door of what looked like a wooden shed. Chef was standing outside, looking at his captives with a proud smile and crossed arms.

""You can't do this to us!"" Lindsay told him.

""Yeah! You're locking us up like prisoners!"" Axel chimed in.

""Tell it to yo' prison guard,"" Chef told them as he gestured over to Fang, who was chained to a thin stump sticking out of the mud. He growled viciously at them from the end of his leash, causing Axel and Lindsay to gasp and Chef to walk away cackling.

The shot cut to a close-up of the GPS map, a red icon bearing Shawn's face now next to one of the flashing lights.

""The first landmark and I'm to tag it!"" Shawn smirked as he shook his can of black paint. He tagged the rock with a Z. The camera zoomed out as he turned and ran back to the left.

""That's a cool tag!"" Emma called out to Shawn as she ran to the mountain. ""Hmm...,"" she murmured as she paused in front of the wall. ""What should I tag?"" The sound of an approaching engine was heard. ""I know!"" she said to herself as she began to spray using her purple paint.

The shot cut to her parked go-kart as Alejandro and Noah arrived next to it, got out, and ran up to the wall. ""Hey Emma. Glad we caught up with you,"" Alejandro said while shaking his can of red paint.

""Shawn is ahead of us, but we should be safe in the vote,"" Noah said and held his can of blue paint.

""Done!"" Alejandro cried after he and Noah finished their tags - a red checkmark and a blue no symbol. ""Come on!""

Alejandro ran to his kart, and Noah was about to follow suit until he saw Emma still working on her tag. ""Emma, that's impressive, but you don't have to-"" he said, but got interrupted by Alejandro honking the horn. ""You don't need to-"" he got cut off by another honk. ""I'm coming!""

Noah went back to his kart. ""What did you say?"" Emma stopped spraying, but resumed once she got no response.

The scene cut to Fang, still growling at the end of his leash. The camera panned over to Axel and Emma, still trapped inside the improvised jail cell.

""I can’t believe I got locked up,"" Lindsay lamented. “I’m innocent, I tell you.”

""And I’m Aphrodite,"" Axel snarked. ""But we're not getting out of here without working together. Deal?""

Lindsay nodded. ""Deal. Are you able to bend these bars?""

""Like straws,"" Axel bragged.

""Good, because I think there’s a shortcut we can use to get between the landmarks faster,"" Lindsay said.

""And that's two down. And best of all, nobody's catching up,"" Shawn said as he carefully walked back towards his kart. The shot zoomed out to show his tag on the bark of the currently-dormant squid-tree, and Shawn hopped into his kart and drove off just as Noah and Alejandro arrived.

""We're still in second,"" Alejandro griped as he ran to the tree with Noah right behind him. ""How am I… I mean, we, supposed to win like this?""

""By not sitting around complaining about it, Al,"" Noah said as the tree's eye opened up and looked down at them.

""Please call me Alejandro!"" Alejandro told him before turning his attention to the tree. Before he could start tagging, however, a tentacle reached down and grabbed him around the waist, pulling him close and slamming him against the tree. Noah gasped in concern, but seemed to be frozen in fear.

The scene cut back to the makeshift jail cell as Axel finally bent the bars open with a powerful grunt. ""Let's get moving,"" she told Lindsay, and the two ducked out through the gap.

They were immediately confronted by a snarling, snapping Fang, but Axel just gave him a quick punch on the nose, knocking him back a few feet. ""Look, we don't have time for you,"" she told him as he propped himself up on one arm and rubbed where he'd been hit. ""And you can't attack us since you’re tied up, so don't bother."" Fang looked over at the stump he was chained to, growled at it, then started to bite and gnaw at it.

He snapped through it in seconds, and turned a dark and cocky growl up towards...nothing, as the camera zoomed out to reveal that Lindsay and Axel were no longer present. Fang growled in frustration.

""That was really impressive,"" Lindsay told Axel as the two hopped into their karts and sped away.

""Yeah,"" Axel smirked. ""Now about that shortcut?""

Lindsay looked down at her GPS. ""I think I've figured it out. We just have to go around the-"" With her attention on the map, her kart began to swerve, and the shot pulled back to show her bumping into Axel, cutting off her explanation.

A sudden buzz from her GPS got her attention, though, and the camera moved over her shoulder to show the screen flickering as the player icons moved between the landmarks – Axel and Lindsay moving towards the first; Emma little ways ahead of them; and the other three around the second. A small window popped up in the middle of the screen, showing what appeared to be a live feed of a rather odd-looking Chris McLean. ""Listen- up-,"" he said in an oddly stilted voice. ""Three- landmarks- wasn't- tough- enough- sooo- I- add-ed- a- fourth."" Another blinking dot appeared on the map, the camera zooming out to show it roughly in the middle of the other three. ""It's- a- doozy- a- mountainside- right- in- the- center- of- the- island."" The grainy, flickering live feed reappeared, the shot zoomed in enough to show that 'Chris' looked suspiciously corpse-like, with grayed skin, closed eyes, and tongue lolling out of a drooping head. ""Now- GET- tagging- and- don't- spare- the- paint. McLeeeeean, out.""

The broadcast ended not as though its window had been closed, but as though a television had been turned off. The shot cut to a close-up of a tape recorder in the hand of Chef Hatchet, who rewound it and replayed the phrase ""McLeeeeean, out."" The shot pulled back, revealing Chef to be holding a beaten-up dummy of the host in front of a television camera.

""Nobody touches my stuff,"" Chef told the camera filming him. ""NOBODY!"" he repeated as a dramatic riff played, and he descended into a mad cackle.

The scene flashed to Mount Looming Tragedy, where Emma had just finished her first tag – a purple tag of her face on the rock. The sound of engines got her attention, and she turned around just as Axel and Lindsay arrived.

""You guys caught up already? I should tag something more simple,"" Emma said, dashing back down to her own kart as the two girls disembarked with their paint cans.

""Nice shortcut,"" Axel told Lindsay, who smiled proudly and ran into the side of the mount. Axel then tagged a simple green X on the rock face.

The scene moved next to another rocky peak, a slope cut into the side and several pines dotted around the landscape. A sharp panting filled the air as the camera panned up to the large totem pole standing at the summit, where Shawn was, with great difficulty, scaling the side.

""Okay,"" he mumbled to himself as he struggled to get a foothold and haul himself up another couple inches, ""that last-second extra landmark was out of the blue, but I'm still in the lead. Just a little bit more and I'm actually gonna win this.""

The sound of engines drew his attention downward along with the camera. Alejandro and Noah had arrived at the base of the pole, quickly jumping out of their karts and dashing over to start their climb.

""Sorry guys,"" Shawn called down at them, ""but I've got this one in the bag.""

""We’ll see about that!"" Alejandro yelled up at him as the two boys began to climb.

""I know it’s a competition,"" Noah told him, ""but we should focus more on winning for ourselves!""

""That goal has not been erased from my mind,"" Alejandro told him. ""I know how we can buy ourselves enough time to beat Shawn.""

“Whatever you got, go ahead and do it,” Noah said.

""Yes!"" Shawn said as he finally reached the top of the totem, which was carved like an eagle's head and immediately started tagging his Z. ""Three landmarks down and one more to go!""

“Shawn, is that an alien UFO flying overhead!” Alejandro said in pretend shock.

“The aliens are here?!” Shawn panicked and inadvertently let go of the eagle's head. Shawn landed with a groan on his back on the ground and was knocked out, his can of paint by his side.

""Don’t worry! Shawn will recover by the time we’re done tagging this!"" Alejandro said as he reached the top and quickly tagged his checkmark.

""That was a bit much, but you didn’t kill him,"" Noah said, still climbing up the totem pole.

A flash took the scene to another part of the woods, where Lindsay, Axel, and Emma were all racing one another with fairly content smiles on their faces. Emma laughed triumphantly as she took the lead, only for Axel to quickly regain it with a smirk and a ""See you later!"" She, in turn, was cut off by Lindsay, who ramped out of the forest itself to get back in front.

""This is so cool!"" Lindsay beamed, driving off with a confident smile that was shared by the other two girls as they closed the gap she'd created.

""Come on,"" Noah told Alejandro as the shot cut back to the two of them standing at the base of the pole, Shawn still knocked out. ""We gotta go so we can win.""

Alejandro smirked at the snarker. ""We aren't going anywhere,"" he said calmly. ""I'm going to the last landmark and you can find a new way there.""

Noah watched Alejandro running off. ""Wait, you’re betraying me right now?!"" he said angrily.

Alejandro got into Noah’s vehicle. “That is what the competition’s about. Enjoy taking the hurl tonight.” He drove off without his original kart tied to the back.

Noah huffed, and picked up the ropes that were used as a tow line and tried to drag Alejandro’s old kart away.

Shawn finally got back to his feet fully awake, and he wasted no time getting into his kart and driving off to the last landmark, passing Noah along the way.

Confessional: Shawn

""Alejandro must’ve been seeing things, because that UFO didn’t come over to take me away like I thought it would,"" Shawn said thoughtfully.

Confessional Ends"

In the image above we can see in different categories like institutional usage, Swift interoperability, DTCC SmartNav and Chainlink AI Oracles.

**Institutional Usage**

As we can see in the image institutions like Fidelity International and Sygnum are using Chainlink for live operations and towards production use of case. Also Grupo Bancolombia and Wenia shows its role in the digital transformation in global markets.

**Swift Interoperability**

This one is quite big because Swift is really one of the most used financial systems by banks to make payemnts, etc and its collaboration with Chainlink is very important to make the project an standard. We can also see that DTCC, Euroclear and big banks like BNP Paribas and Citi are using it for cross chain interoperability and global financial ecosystems.

**DTCC SmartNAV Initiative**

This initiative is also quite important because it involves big boys like JP Morgan, State Street, and Franklin Templeton in a project to modernize fund settlement and asset tokenization processes.

**AI-Powered Oracles**

Chainlink is also getting ready for the future introducing AI oracles for financial data and collaborating with institutions like UBS and Wellington Management for decentralized financial analytics.

**Summary**

The level of institutional adoption that Chainlink is experiencing, is demonstrating that Chainlink is a really solid project that is here to stay and that will probably take a big role in the future financial ecosystems. Maybe not famous and shinny like other projects but they will be part of the core of every financial systems.

As the crypto space evolves, identifying promising tokens becomes critical for investors. This guide provides an in-depth look at some of the most promising DeFi tokens, answering key questions like ""What are the top 5 DeFi tokens?"" and ""Which crypto to buy for 2025?"" Let's explore these tokens and their potential in detail.

# What Are the Top 5 DeFi Tokens?

The DeFi space is characterized by innovation and growth, making it challenging to select the best tokens. However, these five stand out for their robust ecosystems, utility, and potential for future growth:

# 1. $STETH (Lido Staked Ether)

$STETH represents Ethereum staked through Lido Finance, a leading liquid staking platform. With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a lucrative option. $STETH allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to use their staked assets across DeFi protocols.

# Why Invest in $STETH?

* Exposure to Ethereum’s growth.
* Dual earnings from staking rewards and DeFi yields.
* A cornerstone asset for Ethereum-based DeFi strategies.

# 2. $LINK (Chainlink)

$LINK powers the Chainlink network, a decentralized oracle solution that connects smart contracts to real-world data. Chainlink’s oracles are integral to DeFi, powering platforms like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound.

**Key Features:**

* High demand due to integration with major protocols.
* Use cases beyond DeFi, including gaming and insurance.
* Staking incentives expected to grow as Chainlink evolves.

# 3. $UNI (Uniswap)

$UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum. As a leader in the DEX space, Uniswap has revolutionized token trading through automated market makers (AMMs).

**Why $UNI Matters:**

* Significant market share in the DEX space.
* Governance power in shaping Uniswap’s future.
* Potential for fee-sharing mechanisms in upcoming updates.

# 4. $AAVE

$AAVE is the native token of the Aave protocol, a decentralized lending platform. Users can lend, borrow, and earn interest without intermediaries. Aave is at the forefront of DeFi’s lending and borrowing ecosystem.

**Notable Advantages:**

* Innovative features like flash loans.
* Cross-chain compatibility (e.g., Polygon and Avalanche).
* Growing adoption among institutional investors.

# 5. $DAI (MakerDAO’s Stablecoin)

$DAI is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike centralized stablecoins, $DAI is backed by over-collateralized crypto assets, ensuring stability and transparency.

**Why $DAI?**

* Essential for DeFi liquidity pools.
* Preferred stablecoin for decentralized trading.
* Strong backing by MakerDAO’s governance system.

Turn that caps lock off and gush about whatever achievements you want to showcase, or comment about what made you smile this week!

&#x200B;

**A few things to keep in mind:**

&#x200B;

*  If you want to do some uppercase letters, feel free to, but try to avoid shouting! Sunday is a chill day.
*  Avoid being maliciously happy at the expense of others.
*  If you have a screenshot you'd like to share, please host on [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) and you can comment here. You can hyperlink by using brackets and parentheses, for example: \\\[desired text here\\\](insert hyperlink here). If you are on mobile, all you have to do is hit the chainlink, enter your desired text in the first box, then insert the link in the second box. We personally recommend Imgur, since it is free and does not require you to sign up.
*  Phone camera photos are not allowed for general posting; however, for the Sunday megathread we have relaxed that restriction. All photos used in a positive and celebratory manner are allowed.
*  Keep any opinions to yourself in the megathread; we don't want to stir up any controversies here, only good vibes.
*  We want to have a chill time celebrating one another and making each other smile, so no comments like ""haha, I'm really happy that it's so easy to 360 a controller player!""

[Chainlink Runtime Environment \(CRE\)](https://preview.redd.it/7koali64npde1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a63601242cb8c351423f64f5c50b423c7651fbf)

A lot of people believe that Chainlink is just an Oracle network but it is more than that. It is an essential infrastructure layer for decentralized future and powered by LINK token. It is a very innovative project with their CCIP, trust minimized compute and their insane amount of integrations. Making LINK a very interesting investment token if you truly believe in Web3.0.

In the image above we can see different groups like cryptographically provable data, cryptographically trust-minimized compute and cross-chain value.

**Cryptographically provable data**

It provides a package or suite of oracle networks like market data, proof of reserve, identity oracles, etc. These services ensures transparent and real time access to reliable data sources like financial feeds, blockchain reserves, etc. These kind of infrastructures empowers use of cases in DeFi and CeFi apps and RWAs.

**Trust-Minimized Compute Services**

This part with verifiable randomness function (VRF), automation networks and functions helps developers to execute computations in a secure way. This helps new hybrid smart contracts and improves Web3 and Web2 apps automation making them transparent like for example in lotteries and gaming.

**Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)**

This part is also very important because it allows easy communication and data transfer between blockchains helping all ecosystems like DeFi, CeFi, smart contracts and making things a lot more easier and adoption cheaper too. This kind of things are the ones that institutions like.

Chainlink Breaks Above Crucial Pattern: Is LINK Price Aiming for $30 This Weekend?,draqai,1i3ug8x,2025-01-17 18:54:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i3ug8x/chainlink_breaks_above_crucial_pattern_is_link/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Chainlink's Wild Ride: $30 in Sight, or Just a Sweet Tease? 💋  

The crypto world is all about curves and climbs this week, honey! $LINK has been giving us all the feels, strutting its way up the charts with a sassy 5% boost in just 24 hours. Currently perched at $24.4, it’s got its sultry eyes locked on that dreamy $30 mark. But is it just a flirt, or is it ready to deliver the goods?  

Big daddy whales are making waves, with $185M worth of transactions driving up the heat. Open interest on $LINK has also spiked to $1.08B, which just screams demand, demand, demand! It’s like everyone wants a piece of this sweet little crypto pie.  

But hold up, not all the vibes are dreamy. While the RSI at 73 is giving ""overbought baddie"" energy, the long/short ratio dropping to 0.4292 is spilling some tea—about 70% of traders are betting this beauty might take a tumble soon. Ouch, right?  

Don’t sweat it though, babes. If $LINK can hold its ground above the $25 threshold and keep its chic above the EMA20 line, we could see that $30 fantasy come alive. Otherwise, brace for a possible dip into the $19-$20 zone. Either way, this crypto queen has all eyes on her.  

What do you think, crypto cutie? Will $LINK steal the spotlight and hit $30, or is this just a seductive tease?

Donald Trump-linked DeFi project clarifies $60 million ETH movement amid sell-off speculation,Blockmandev,1i24emf,2025-01-15 13:41:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i24emf/donald_trumplinked_defi_project_clarifies_60/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Trump-linked DeFi project sparks buzz over $60M ETH transfers  

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the DeFi initiative tied to US President-elect Donald Trump, recently addressed some eyebrow-raising $60 million Ethereum transactions. On January 15, WLFI clarified that these movements are simply routine treasury management, putting an end to wild sell-off rumors. 

The project revealed it’s reallocating assets rather than offloading tokens. According to WLFI, this strategy is aimed at ensuring a robust and efficient treasury operation, and there’s no space for speculation—it’s just another day of business as usual. 

Blockchain sleuths at Lookonchain stirred the pot by pointing out significant cryptocurrency transactions. WLFI reportedly swapped 103 $WBTC for 3,075 $ETH, followed by depositing approximately $59.8 million worth of $ETH into Coinbase. They later purchased 17.62 $WBTC using $1.7 million in $USDT. Lookonchain also flagged a $5 million hit on WLFI’s recent asset repositioning—but hey, not every move in crypto is a moonshot, right?

The project has been on a steady path of portfolio diversification, loading up on top-tier DeFi tokens such as Aave, Chainlink, and Ondo. However, despite its progress, WLFI has kept things eerily quiet on social media. 

Notably, WLFI’s groundbreaking vision revolves around being a one-stop DeFi destination for lending, borrowing, and digital asset investments. The initiative initially shot for a $300 million token sale target but dialed it back to $30 million after some hurdles, a goal they reached with support from crypto titan Justin Sun. 

Since Trump’s election win, WLFI token holders have been smiling through an 81% surge in profits. With $80.2 million in total gains, according to Dune Analytics, it seems WLFI is playing the long game.

Will 2024 witness WLFI claim a bigger piece of the DeFi pie? The crypto crowd will be watching.

"Cat in car accident, scared they won't pay his vet bills",FIVcats,1i1tv1c,2025-01-15 04:34:57,6,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIVcats/comments/1i1tv1c/cat_in_car_accident_scared_they_wont_pay_his_vet/,cookiemonsters19,,"I was in a 100 determined not my fault car accident 1 month ago.  My cat in the car had access to a hard carrier and also could roam (carrier door was ajar) and during the accident I don't know what happened was he in the carrier or out?  It was a large surface street ,  I was on the right side lane and next to me was a chain link fence with bushes and stray animals. 


My cat must have gotten tossed around. I dunno. 
I opened the door and he stumbled out. He is 2. He ran into the bushes with the strays and got into a catfight while we tried to figure out car (Not cat)  damage.  When I got him later he was missing half his tiny front teeth on the bottom and half on top and chipped ALL his canines. 

Before a vet had said he had 1 tooth fracture (on medical notes) and didn't mention any other teeth at all. Didn't say anything good or bad about other teeth just said 1 tooth fractured and that's it. This is relevant later. 


I know for a FACT he ONLY had 1 canine teeth fracture before this and ALL other teeth intact. The other ones must have gotten broken in the accident. OR in a catfight when he ran out. He is fixed. He acted wierd afterwards. 

I took him to a cheapo nonprofit vet 2 days later for a dental appt and they told me he was missing a bunch of teeth. They documented it as enamel defects and circled 4 canines and half top and half botom.front tiny teeth. The document is scrawled in messy handwriting and they won't reissue records. All they did was examine and then clean his teeth ubder anesthesia no xrays at all nothing else. 

Before he was SNAP tested for FIV and was positive. But was told he should be PCR tested since snap is not accurate.. 

I am worried he might be negative before since snap FIV tests are not accurate. And now positive  due to cat fight. 

Insurance adjuster just called and scared my injured friend in the car into settling for a few hundred. 

They will call me soon and determine my property damage. Cats are property in the state. 

What should I do to maximize i get my cat checked out and have them cover the medical bills? They don't do pain and suffering for cats of course they just do med bills.

I feel like it is say the wrong thing the adjuster will screw me with every oppty they get. 

Say the cat got teeth knocked out during the car accident? And stop at that? Bc then the insurance  will cover a more though vet examination. Such as dental xrays. Altho I'm afraid of putting him under anesthesia again tho :( although he is very healthy. He was just anethsia under 1 moth ago for his dental exam. They didn't do xrays tho. 

Do i even say he got out after I opened the door and he stumbled out? Wouldn't that be grounds to cover the PCR FIV test due to minor catfight? Without the accident  he wouldn't have gotten out and been in a cat fight. He was traumatized and stumbled into stray cat territory since I was on the right side of the road next to chainlink fence with bushes. The PCR FIV test is expensive. 

**Or would the insurance argue that he got out in the confusion of the accident, it's my fault, the teeth loss and any xrays etc is now my fault and they pay me nothing???** 

Also he is walking a bit wonky but only his back legs. 

I'm scared of not getting reimbursed a d given how MEAN the insurance adjuster was to my injured friend, I am afraid to say the wrong thing and get every voided. 

Nobody saw the cat escape bc it was on the opposite side. Not even the other driver. It was only me dealing with the cat escaping and subsequent fight. 1 month ago.only vet visit was 2 days after and it was a nonprofit cheapo vet woth terrible records and they rushed it. 

Any tips. Just scared folks. Also, I have to pay out of.pocket. before reimbursement :("

 BTguru Partners with Chainlink to Advance Tokenized Asset Adoption in Turkey,ethtrader,1i1s265,2025-01-15 02:12:54,8,0.79,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i1s265/btguru_partners_with_chainlink_to_advance/,kirtash93,Discussion,"Today I crossed with this adoption bullish [Tweet ](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1879292504513646813)for Chainlink (LINK) that confirms that BTguru has partnered with Chainlink to drive the adoption of institutional tokenized assets.

[LINK logo and Turkey Flag](https://preview.redd.it/mhjremkix3de1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce3be48a1ca6d1d88d107e2a629c42200343a82c)

For those who don't know about [BTguru](https://bt.guru/en/home/), they are a leading blockchain infrastructure provider in Turkey.

These are really exciting news for LINK supporters and also for those wanting blockchain to succeed. Turkey is just a country but you know how this goes, the rest use to follow if others succeed.

The goal of this partnership is to tackle one of the biggest problems regarding tokenized assets. They need to be secure, transparent and with reliable data. Chainlink is the perfect project for the job and BTguru plans to ensure that tokenized assets like real state, commodities and other  financial instruments can operate with trust and security to attract more institutional players.

**Why this is important?**

Well, assets tokenization trend keeps growing and gaining attention and is going to be one of those things in the future that becomes the usual thing. It improves liquidity, faster transactions and worldwide access to investments. However, a robust infrastructure and reliable data has slowed adoption (we are kind of early) but LINK is doing an amazing job on that part. This partnership can be another piece in the table to believe in LINK more in the long term because I believe it will be everywhere. Another bullish thing is that Turkey's interest in blockchain tech is increasing meaning that we are in the right path.

"Litecoin - Risk, reward and the future",CryptoCurrency,1i0zbvm,2025-01-14 00:47:52,0,0.45,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0zbvm/litecoin_risk_reward_and_the_future/,HugeAd1329,ANALYSIS,"Hello Reddit! I have never posted on here before, but for some strange reason I felt like today was a good day to do so.  I'm going to give you some of my thoughts as to why I think Litecoin has a huge potential upside with a reasonably low downside, and why I am comfortably going to hold it for many years to come.



Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin. But for now I'm going to shine some light on Litecoin. I will try to back up as much of this info as I can with links.



For those of you that don't know, Litecoin was the 2nd Cryptocurrency ever created. Widely considered ""Digital silver"" to Bitcoin's ""Digital gold"" because it offers a faster, more accessible alternative while sharing similar foundational principles. It was fairly launched in 2011 with no pre-mine, the total supply is capped at 84 million coins, and the block generation time is approximately 2.5 minutes (unlike BTC's 10 minutes) making transactions faster and more efficient. It has maintained 100% uptime since its inception, running on a PoW blockchain similar to Bitcoin, and is secured by miners using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. Litecoin is ""merge mined"" with Dogecoin and Bellscoin. This means if miners want to mine for DOGE/BELLS, they run miners to secure the Litecoin network, and as a reward they are given Litecoin, with DOGE and BELLS as extras.



As mentioned, the total supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins, which is four times the total supply of Bitcoin at 21 million. This gives BTC and LTC a 1:4 supply ratio. Currently, LTC is valued at approximately $100 per coin, while BTC is priced around $100,000 per coin. This represents a 1:1000 price ratio between LTC and BTC. The disparity between the price and supply ratios is enormous. LTC has room for MANY 100X's to still be a mere fraction of the market cap of Bitcoin..



A large price disparity is to be expected, of course, given that Bitcoin is a more established asset with greater recognition and adoption. But there are signs that LTC is on track to become a GIANT.



Although Bitcoin is the #1 Cryptocurrency as far as market cap goes, Litecoin is THE most popular coin for crypto payments. BitPay, the leading crypto payment platform, recently released its 2024 statistics in this tweet: [https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145](https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145) , and Litecoin was clearly the peoples favorite. 



LTC was used for 201,165 payments, significantly surpassing BTC with 130,250 payments. ETH followed with 56,365 payments, while DOGE and USDC both saw 32,148 payments each. This is most likely due to LTC's low fees and fast transaction times, which make LTC a much better choice than BTC for payments, LTC has the lowest transaction fee out of all large L1's, which is shown in this post by IntoTheBlock: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628) with the average transaction fee being a mere $0.0051.



Over the last year, the hash rate of Litecoin has absolutely soared as more miners are getting involved, driving up the mining difficulty. Which is an interesting metric, as it's widely believed with Bitcoin, the higher the difficulty, the higher the price. It seems like it could be Litecoin's turn to follow that trend in the near future.



Large institutions have been accumulating LTC heavily as of late.



Fidelity, who manages $12 Trillion in assets overall, has just recently added LTC to their Digital Asset portfolio. They exclusively only offer 3 different cryptocurrencies; BTC, LTC and ETH. In late December they did a report on LTC which can be found through this post: [https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712](https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712) and they are actually doing a livestream ""Covering Crypto"" today! (Jan 14 - 9a PST / 12p EST) according to this post: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199) 



Grayscale, who is one of the world's largest digital currency asset managers; managing over 18 billion USD worth of assets in their crypto portfolio.. has been consistently scooping up LTC in large quantities. Over the last year LTC has been the coin they have invested the most in, with many occasions where LTC was the only coin they purchased that day. They have managed to accumulate over 2 million LTC as seen here: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709) and their full GBTC portfolio showing their crypto diversification and inflows/outflows can be seen here: [https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale](https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale)  


On top of this, we are beginning to see applications for Litecoin ETF's. On October 16, Canary Capital filed an S-1 for a proposed spot LTC ETF, this can be seen here: [https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859](https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859) . Also on November 25, LTC was listed as an eligible currency for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETC as shown here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm), in the paragraph ""As of today, based on the Sponsor’s assessment, the following assets meet all eligibility criteria and may be eligible for inclusion: bitcoin, ether, avalanche, chainlink, and litecoin"".



Because Litecoin shares much of the same technology and fundamentals as Bitcoin, it's expected to navigate regulatory challenges smoothly, having already benefited from Bitcoin's precedent. This sets it apart from other large cryptocurrencies, which still face the risk of being classified as securities or encountering similar regulatory hurdles.



According to data from blockchain analyst IntoTheBlock, in December 2024 there was a whopping 370k active addresses, 200k daily transactions, 10b in monthly volume which exceeds the entire LTC market cap, and 78% of all LTC holders have been holding for over 1 year, indicating that many holders are expecting further price growth. As seen here: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117)



One other interesting topic of discussion in the crypto community is the threat of quantum computing. Thankfully, the Litecoin Foundation is actively implementing and upgrading the LTC network, and I have seen discussion about how it would be much easier to upgrade the LTC network to make it quantum resistant in comparison to BTC (I read this somewhere, I can't find the link lol).



One example of the Litecoin Foundations recent innovations is the introduction of a privacy feature to Litecoin. Called MWEB (short for ""MimbleWimble""), this feature provides privacy similar to XMR by completely hiding transaction amounts and participant addresses. This means that users can send private transactions without revealing sensitive details on the blockchain.



In this current climate, there's a lot of crypto projects that are failures, rug pulls, scams, projects that overpromise and underdeliver. LTC is none of the above, LTC has proven itself in so many ways, cemented itself in crypto history.. and it's just getting started.



This thread is getting very long so I might leave it there. I'm sure there's heaps of other cool stuff I could mention, and I've forgotten a lot. But maybe I've taught you something new about LTC and that's cool. 



In conclusion, I'm expecting the disparity between the price and supply ratios of LTC/BTC to creep closer over time. I could be completely wrong. For me (not a psychic), I find it hard to imagine a world where LTC goes much below $50 (-50% from current price), yet there seems to be potential for hundreds of X's. I am happy with this risk/reward, and I will continue to invest for years to come.



\#LTC activity on X has been increasing a lot lately, so there's lots more info you can find there with a quick search.



Excited for the future.

Chain link outdoor enclosure? ,Sulcata,1i06lwe,2025-01-13 00:04:31,1,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sulcata/comments/1i06lwe/chain_link_outdoor_enclosure/,TankClassic8609,,"I currently have a 13 L x 9 W x 6.5 H chainlink chicken run. I have a 1.5 year old Sulcata right now and have been brainstorming ideas for his outdoor enclosure that I’ll be starting in spring and I thought “I wonder why I couldn’t put two, three, even four of these enclosures together as a tortoise enclosure.”  Two of them side by side would be 234 square feet. That would be huge for him right now at his small size and I could theoretically add one on as he grows as needed. I haven’t seen a single person with a chainlink enclosure so there must be a reason why it would be a poor idea versus the wooden based ones. I was thinking I could do 4 feet tall of metal sheeting all around the bottom to deter him from escaping and/pacing.  I would also put at least one foot, if not two foot, of underground barrier around the edges so he doesn’t dig out. 

There’s also a door for me for easy access. The top is completely covered with chicken wire for predator safety.  I would also have a large “house” inside that will be insulated and complete with livestock heating pad and heating pad as needed for winter. 

My other idea is just to give him a large privacy fenced area. I’m not low on funds for this project but if it’s appropriate, then of course the chain link would be much more cost effective. 

Let me know your thoughts on why this could be a problem. Thank you. "
