"Tried to celebrate Þorri w/ the locals in Höfn, but got turned away!",VisitingIceland,1i9xice,2025-01-25 16:26:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1i9xice/tried_to_celebrate_þorri_w_the_locals_in_höfn_but/,JuVondy,Language & Culture,"We stopped in Höfn for dinner, and the owner of the restaurant lamented that they were quiet tonight because the local community was celebrating þorri at the nearby sports complex. This is a very old traditional holiday we discovered, where many old style foods (sheeps head, testicles, etc) are eaten in honor and in connection to the ancestors of the comminity.

When we tried to enter, we had many eyes on us and were stopped. When we asked if we could join they were amused, and tried to charge us 20,000 ISK to join. We could tell we were being overcharged as they laughed when we almost agreed to pay before realizing how much this was. Eventually we decided to just leave.

Was wondering if this is a normal thing. I totally understand having local holidays, but I was totally willing to participate and try these traditional foods and dance! The whole space was filled with neon and blacklights and mushroom art so I imagine it was probably a pretty debaucherous event

Has anyone here ever been lucky enough to be included in this event? I respect getting turned away, but all it did was honestly peak my curiosity about this holiday. "

Too Small? (Ironman Essential 30),timex,1i9wehz,2025-01-25 15:37:55,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/timex/comments/1i9wehz/too_small_ironman_essential_30/,NerveTonic9,,"Hi! I recently got this ironman model for daily wear and exercise. I really like the style (grey tone and neon highlight). It feels comfortable overall, but I just can't shake the feeling that the face is maybe a little small for my wrist. I am coming from a 46mm Timex marathon that seemed big way back when I first got it, so maybe I've gotten used to the larger size. Seems like a lot of watches are trending large these days, so maybe I'm comparing too much to what I see around. 

Any thoughts on the photos? When I look, I do think it looks small in the full body shot, but on the wrist the lugs seem to be in just the right spot... Thanks for your feedback!

I did some research and got the tank set up and cycled, he gave me everything I needed (heater, filter, thermometer, water conditioner, etc). Tank is 10 gal. The betta and one of the tetras unfortunately didn’t survive the move (betta was already pretty old), so I decided to wait a while to make absolutely sure the water parameters were good enough for more fish. I got some ember tetras after a week or two so that the last remaining tetra would have some friends, and then I waited a while more before getting a new half moon betta today! 

He seems to be adjusting well to the new environment, but I want to make sure I’m doing everything right. He seems to be hanging around the heater a lot, is that normal? Water is at around 79 degrees. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice for things I can do to make him as comfortable as he can be? I’ve never had fish before and I don’t know anyone else who has fish, so I just want to make sure he’s doing okay. 

Also, does anyone have any name suggestions? Stupid names are welcome as well as “normal” ones. "

Beginning with when this all started – the trip outside with her railgun. Almost getting killed by N, being able to shoot him down at the last possible moment. It was as if Uzi could see it all happening again. She was spectating it from under a pile of worker drone remains.

It didn’t take long until N stood back up, still dazed. And when he came to, he was his friendly self again. The polar opposite of just a minute before, the way he always was, until he was forced to leave just over a week ago. Was she too harsh to him? He was always nice; he might never have actually had an intention to kill, other than for oil. As dangerous as the disassembly drones be, at least this one acted like a friend.

By now, the two had entered the spaceship. “I’m not going to get embarrassed by myself. I’m not watching that.”, she thought and decided to switch to her next memory.

She sat in the back of a room. Her classroom, fully staffed. The only one that caught her interest was the only other resident of the last row, next to the trash can: herself. Despite this being a group project, this one drone worked alone and struggled alone. Vaguely, Uzi could remember. The group project that would, many years later, inspire her railgun.

As crazy as it is to have a conversation with yourself – it would fit the others’ notion of her. Uzi decided to step in and her past and imaginary self: “Hey, you don’t have a partner. Want me to work with you?”. Her past answered with “If you need to.”. This sure was a very strange feeling, considering this, still, was her memory playing with herself.

As much mental strain as this evoked, Uzi decided to take this chance. Maybe she could use this to find out want went wrong?

“Why do you not have anyone to work together with?”

“I don’t need them; I am able to finish this myself. And I would if you didn’t disturb me.”

“*Bite me*! I offered you help, and you accepted! I can see that you had trouble – why do you not accept others’ help?”, Uzi responded while grabbing her past self by the shoulder.

“Because everyone treats me like you do!”, she answered and ripped herself free and moved away half a step.

“I don’t need to argue with this.”, Uzi decided. So, she went back further. Until everything became much foggier, and everyone was replaced by rough silhouettes. This had to be when she was extremely young. As little as she could make out visually, the sound was still clear as it must have been back then. She heard one familiar voice, and another one less familiar, but not unknown.

These were her parents. And this must have been their home, before the murder drones came. It was quiet outside. All Uzi heard was the conversation between her mother and father. She didn’t care much for it, and it didn’t matter right now. They didn’t talk about anything significant. This would have been the only chance to get information from her mother.

Disappointed, Uzi was close to giving up on this approach. She didn’t realize how the mood outside had shifted. Until a dark shadow crashed through the window. Her mother sprang up and shouted at Khan to run away with Uzi – she would try to stop it. At first hesitant, Khan had no choice. Uzi did not want to see what would happen next. She turned away and followed her father. Until she, amongst the cacophony of noises, heard a scream, followed by the sizzling of acid. Taken by what had happened, Uzi decided she needed to see. As bad of an idea it might be.

She turned back, but as soon as her mother was within sight, the shadow rushed towards her, landing a deadly blow.

Everything turned dark grey. What would happen if she died within a simulation of her own memories?

A faint, black symbol started appearing. At first a point, surrounded by a hexagon. Then, three curved arrows pointing away. It bore a slight resemblance to the dreaded symbol that replaces her eye.

It slowly began to turn, expanding into the third dimension. Its arrows moving around like arms. It ended up as a hexagonal prism, with three appendages ending in sharp claws. Its main body covered with a substance like blood, hiding away a mechanical interior.

It was the same object left behind by J. Only, it didn’t emit neon yellow light. This time, it was purple light. It began encasing itself in pairs of long-drawn tubes, gradually curving around, creating a protective cage like ribs.

some girl tried to “overpay” for my nfr giraffe,AdoptMeRBX,1i9vrf7,2025-01-25 15:09:24,5,0.78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMeRBX/comments/1i9vrf7/some_girl_tried_to_overpay_for_my_nfr_giraffe/,reqlve,✔ Rant ⛌,"i was playing on my laptop, so i don’t have screenshots. i did take a video scrolling through the chat, but i can’t blur usernames in the video so won’t be able to post it.

basically i was playing with my sister, working together to find the shooting stars around the map. i had found all of them and she’d found about half of them, so i was letting her do her thing and i was doing some tasks to bring age up pots with my giraffe. i will say, i would consider myself rich. not mega bat dragon, mega shadow dragon, mega frost dragon, all that kind of rich, but i have lots of neon legendaries including a high tiers, and just a lot of neons and megas. my profile reflects that, and also says “none of my neons or megas are for trade unless otherwise stated.” as we’re all VERY familiar with, people cannot and will not read, and try to offer for NFT pets all the flipping time. 

so i’m doing tasks, i’m at the fire hydrant behind the toy shop, letting my giraffe… do his business… and all of a sudden this girl appears tomorrow. she then pulls out an owl, rides it, and then runs around me in circles. now, i have my trades off so that’s important to know. she then gets right in my face and says “trade.” i ask why and she goes “i have a good offer.” so for shits and giggles, i trade her. my giraffe is always nft but i’ll see offers i guess, what’s the harm in that? plus i know i can’t fall victim to the trade freezing hacks as my giraffe is locked so i can’t even add it to a trade.

so anyways, she puts the FR owl in, then added 2 aussie eggs, a fossil egg, then she added a danger egg only to take it out. she added a monkey box, a regal chest, and i think 2 ride potions. as one does, i said “sorry nty” and declined the trade. she started sending a bunch of tagged messages in chat, so i can only imagine she was cussing me out ofc. then she said, “why did you decline? i was over.” i had made my way to the playground at this point, but whipped around so fast and went back over to her behind the toy shop again. for reference, a FR owl isn’t even worth 100 on elve, i think around 97.5, and a NFR giraffe is 416 i believe. i looked it up at the time to let her know she was, in fact, NOT over at all, but i’m not positive i remember correctly rn so i may be off by a few. 

by this point, my sister had come over and was telling the girl that she was really under and all that. i said something like “your FR owl is 97.5 on elve and my giraffe is 416, so mine is over 4 times your pet’s value sorry” and she just got so mad😭 she started sending more tagged messages and then said “but my owl is FR and i put a lot of out of game eggs and stuff.” my sister said “yeah she already said it was FR” and i told her the stuff she added, while out of game, didn’t even come close to making up the value. i’m not trying to be mean but oh my gosh she kept insisting she was over. after all that she started calling my sister and i “f@t” and that i had no friends and spent my whole life grinding the game lol. i’ve had so many 
weird/annoying/stupid trade encounters but this one was something else. sorry for the long story, hard to explain everything without chat screenshots lol"
Any advice for a new betta?,Aquariums,1i9vqe1,2025-01-25 15:08:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vqe1,oatmilf371,Help/Advice,"A friend of mine moved recently, and he offered to give me his betta, two neon tetras, and all of the equipment he had for free so I said what the hell sure. I did some research and got the tank set up and cycled, he gave me everything I needed (heater, filter, thermometer, water conditioner, etc). Tank is 10 gal. The betta and one of the tetras unfortunately didn’t survive the move (betta was already pretty old), so I decided to wait a while to make absolutely sure the water parameters were good enough for more fish. I got some ember tetras after a week or two so that the last remaining tetra would have some friends, and then I waited a while more before getting a new half moon betta today! 

He seems to be adjusting well to the new environment, but I want to make sure I’m doing everything right. He seems to be hanging around the heater a lot, is that normal? Water is at around 79 degrees. Does anyone have any suggestions/advice for things I can do to make him as comfortable as he can be? I’ve never had fish before and I don’t know anyone else who has fish, so I just want to make sure he’s doing okay. 

Also, does anyone have any name suggestions? Stupid names are welcome as well as “normal” ones. "

Enjoyed my first playthrough. Ideas for second?,Starfield,1i9uyum,2025-01-25 14:34:21,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1i9uyum/enjoyed_my_first_playthrough_ideas_for_second/,kamyfc,Character Builds,"After getting Starfield recently, I made a character with the intention of not playing any faction or main questline.  
I installed a bunch of mods that 

* got rid of level scaling 
* got rid of the awful bullet sponge combat.
* randomized dungeons and POIs, so we dont see the same POI's
* added space ship fuel consumption system
* added a deadly hazards system so barren planets are really dangerous 
* added a real Oxygen tank system and got rid of that stamina meter

After the boring start, our guy finally jumps to Jemison and New Atlantis where he purchases  Nuclear Rods and Helium 3 and topped up the fuel in his ship. Purchased Oxygen cannisters so he could explore planets without worrying about O2 depletion. Sold all the loot. Had around 40,000 credits.

Our character then said hello to those Constellation snobs and immediately said goodbye to them forever.

Our guy then went to Hope Town, did a lots of surveying and delivery missions. He then set up  setup Water Vapor Extractors, Greenhouse, Animal Husbandry and created factories to manufacture Antibiotics. Made a ton of money and retired at Hope Town.

I feel, setting up manufacturing chains, is one of the most underrated aspects of Starfield! Lot of people who prefer stories in games don't enjoy it, but I loved it.  
The potential to manufacture stuff with complex parts and subparts with multiple outposts was very interesting.   
I also liked surveying and improving my character skills. The gameplay loop was quiet lovely!

All in all, I enjoyed my playthrough even though I did not even do a single quest.

\--------------   
  
Now for my second character, I was thinking of a corporate slave who works for Ryujin industries.  
The idea I had was 

* New game—again abandon those Constellation snobs
* Head to Neon. That is his base
* The idea is to build up his resume (Level 20) so he can apply and join Ryujin industries 
   * Take Bounty missions, Delivery missions as an independent freelancer. 
   * Do some surveying, Work on character's skills 
   * Do Neon city quests
   * Do some other side quests
* Once at level 20, Start the Ryujin industries questline
* Finish the questline and finally the character settles down in Neon.

Now I have no idea what the  Ryujin industries questline is all about and if it is worth it.  
But thats fine, I'm roleplaying after all.   
I enjoy my character's journey more than worrying about the quality of writing, quest design etc. 

I would appreciate some suggestions from experienced Starfield players.   
Thanks for reading!

I Took a Shortcut Through an Empty Mall. I Haven’t Found the Exit Yet.,CreepsMcPasta,1i9ux83,2025-01-25 14:32:18,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1i9ux83/i_took_a_shortcut_through_an_empty_mall_i_havent/,Frequent-Cat,,"I’ve been feeling kind of... off lately. Work has been insane, and most days, I’m too drained to do anything but go straight home and collapse in front of the TV. My routine’s been the same for months: walk out of work, zone out with my headphones, hope no one tries to talk to me, and drive home. It’s not exciting, but it works. Or at least, it did.

A few nights ago, I decided to mix things up. Traffic was bad, the rain was coming down in sheets, and I was tired of staring at the same depressing route home. I figured I’d try a shortcut, a faster way through the maze of downtown streets. The area’s a mess of half-finished renovations and old, crumbling buildings, but I thought I knew it well enough to find my way.

That’s when I remembered the mall.

I used to go there all the time as a kid. Back then, it was huge and crowded, full of life. There was a carousel in the food court, bright neon signs everywhere, and this old candy shop my mom used to bribe me with when I threw tantrums. But as the years went by, the place started to die. Stores closed, and the crowds disappeared. Last I heard, most of it was abandoned except for a few discount shops hanging on by a thread.

I was already running late, and the idea of cutting through the mall popped into my head like it was meant to be. I figured, why not? Even if it’s mostly empty, it’s probably faster than walking around the block in the rain. And hey, maybe I’d get a little nostalgia kick while I was at it.

The entrance I found was one of those side doors, the kind that janitors or delivery workers use. It wasn’t marked, just a plain metal door tucked into an alcove, but it opened without much effort. No locked chain, no rusted-over handle, just a gentle push, and I was in.

The hallway was dimly lit, and the fluorescent lights above buzzed faintly, flickering every few seconds. The air was stale, like it hadn’t been disturbed in a while, and there was this faint smell of mildew that hit me right away. But I shrugged it off. It’s an old building. What did I expect?

At first, it felt kind of cool, like I was stepping into a time capsule. The floors were that old-school white tile with black accents, scuffed and cracked in places, and the walls were covered in faded advertisements for stores that probably hadn’t existed in years. There was a quiet hum in the background, fans or something, maybe- but no voices, no footsteps. Just... stillness.

Something that hit me was the silence. Not the kind of quiet you’d expect in an abandoned place, this was something heavier. The air felt dense, like the building itself was holding its breath. The faint hum of the fluorescent lights above was the only sound, and even that felt like it was straining to break the stillness.

Most of the stores were exactly what I expected: boarded-up or empty shells, their faded signage barely clinging to the walls. A few windows still had displays, but they were like time capsules, mannequins in dated outfits, old movie posters advertising long-forgotten blockbusters, and sale banners with slogans that felt weirdly optimistic for a place like this.

I remember feeling a little uneasy, but I kept telling myself it was just the vibe of an old, abandoned mall. That’s what happens when a place gets left behind. It felt like a ghost of what it used to be, but that was normal, right? Still, I picked up my pace, hoping to get to the other side quickly. I just wanted to be out in the fresh air again.

That’s when I noticed something strange. The layout didn’t feel right. I mean, it had been years since I’d been there, so I figured my memory might be a little off, but the hallways seemed... wrong. Longer than they should’ve been. The way they twisted and turned didn’t make sense, like the angles were slightly off. I’d walk for what felt like minutes, only to turn a corner and find myself back at the same stretch of empty storefronts.

Then I reached the food court, or at least what was left of it. It was completely empty, save for one table sitting dead center. Just one. There was a single chair pulled out slightly, like someone had been sitting there and left in a hurry. On the table was a Styrofoam cup, and I swear, I could see steam rising from it.

That’s when I felt it, that first real twinge of fear. You know that cold rush you get when your body senses something is off before your brain catches up? I stood there for a long moment, staring at that cup, trying to tell myself it was nothing. Maybe it was an old trickle of heat from a vent, or maybe someone was here, just a maintenance worker or another person cutting through like me. I even called out, “Hello? Anyone here?”

Nothing.

I should’ve turned back then. I should’ve taken my chances in the rain, but I convinced myself it was fine. Just an empty building. People leave weird things behind all the time. Right?

So, I kept going. I turned the corner where the exit should’ve been, and... it wasn’t there. No double glass doors, no faded Thank You for Shopping! sign. Just another hallway, stretching deeper into the mall.

That’s when it hit me: I wasn’t getting out of here anytime soon.

\-

I can’t even tell you when it went from “a little weird” to full-blown terrifying, but it happened fast.

The hallways started to feel uncanny. Like, I know how ridiculous this sounds, but they weren’t just hallways anymore. They stretched longer than they should’ve, and every time I thought I recognized a turn, it either led somewhere completely new or looped me right back to where I started. I tried to stay calm. Old buildings are confusing, right? But the more I walked, the more it felt like the place was shifting around me.

Then I started noticing the details. The mannequins in the storefronts, I swear, they weren’t in the same positions when I looked back. I told myself I was imagining it, but I’m not that imaginative. One minute, they’d be posed normally, like you’d expect, arms out, wearing clothes from decades ago- and the next, one would have its head tilted toward me, or its hand would be raised, like it was pointing.

And the walls... God, the walls. Some of the advertisements looked normal from a distance, but when I got closer, the faces on them were all wrong. They were blurry, almost smudged, like someone had rubbed out the features, but I could still make out just enough to know they were faces. And the worst part? I thought I recognized one of them. It looked a little like me, distorted, warped.

I pulled out my phone, hoping I could get my bearings with GPS or at least check the time, but that was useless too. No signal, no Wi-Fi, just a spinning loading wheel that wouldn’t go away. And the time? It was all over the place. One second it said 4:47 p.m., the next it jumped to 11:13. Then it reset entirely, flashing 00:00 like I’d just turned it on for the first time.

I tried retracing my steps, backtracking the way I came, but nothing lined up. The food court? Gone. The hallway with the Styrofoam cup? Now it led to a dead-end with a boarded-up storefront I was sure I hadn’t seen before. I kept walking, though, because what else could I do? But the deeper I went, the stranger it got. Some of the hallways were so long, my phone flashlight couldn’t reach the end. The beam just disappeared into the darkness, like the mall was swallowing the light.

The whispers started soon after that. Faint at first, like someone just out of earshot, but they were definitely there. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, just this low murmur, almost like the hum of the fluorescent lights but... alive. Every now and then, I’d hear a word or two. I think I heard my name once, but I might’ve imagined it. I hope I imagined it.

And then the footsteps. God, the footsteps. I thought I was alone in there, knew I was alone, but suddenly, I could hear them. Just a soft, rhythmic tap-tap-tap behind me. I thought it was an echo of my own steps, so I stopped walking. They didn’t.

I whipped around, shining my flashlight down the hallway, but there was nothing there. Just empty space. The sound stopped too, like whoever, or whatever, was making it knew I was listening. I waited, holding my breath, and after a minute, I turned back around.

The second I started walking again, the footsteps started up too. This time, they were faster, louder, like something was closing the distance between us.

I didn’t look back again. I just started running.

\-

I don’t think I’ve ever felt as relieved as I did when I saw that exit sign.

After what felt like hours of wandering, corridors stretching endlessly, mannequins shifting when I wasn’t looking, whispers that I couldn’t place, I thought I was done for. But then there it was: the bright red glow of an Exit sign above a heavy steel door at the end of the hallway. It stood out like a lifeline in all that darkness, a promise that I wasn’t trapped after all.

I don’t even remember how fast I moved. One second I was standing there, staring, and the next I was sprinting toward it, the sound of my footsteps echoing like gunshots in the empty space. My heart was hammering, but it wasn’t from fear this time, it was relief. I was getting out.

The door was heavy, but it opened without much effort. The moment it swung open, I felt a rush of fresh air hit my face. It smelled like rain, clean and normal. I stepped outside and found myself on a street, one I didn’t recognize but looked like any other part of the city. I saw cars, headlights slicing through the twilight. People walked along the sidewalks, some carrying umbrellas or shopping bags. It was just... life. Real, tangible, normal life.

I actually laughed. I know that sounds crazy, but I did, I laughed out loud, this shaky, almost delirious laugh. All the fear, all the weirdness in that mall... it had gotten to me. I’d let it get to me. And now here I was, standing in the middle of a busy street, like nothing had happened. I even muttered to myself, “You really need to get a grip.”

But then I noticed something.

At first, I couldn’t put my finger on it. I was too busy calming down, trying to process everything. But as I watched the people on the street, I realized they weren’t... moving right. There was this stiffness to them, like their bodies were following a script but didn’t quite know how to stick to it. One woman in a red coat walked past me, her arms swinging in a loop, the same exact motion over and over. A man across the street adjusted his hat, then did it again, and again, as if stuck in a glitch.

And the cars, they were completely silent. No engines, no honking, nothing but the faint hum of the city, like a white noise machine trying to imitate what it thought a street should sound like.

I felt my stomach drop. My relief evaporated, replaced by a cold, sinking dread. Slowly, I turned around, hoping, praying, to see something normal behind me. But what I saw was worse.

The mall was still there. It wasn’t the same door I’d come out of, though. This one was different, taller, darker, with warped glass that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. It was like the building had followed me, refusing to let me go.

The laughter I’d felt earlier? It was gone. All I could think was, I didn’t escape. I never left.

\-

I don’t know why I went back inside. Maybe it was panic, maybe it was desperation, or maybe it was because the mall wouldn’t let me leave, no matter what I did. But as soon as I stepped through the door, I knew I’d made a mistake.

The air was colder, sharper. My breath fogged up, and the faint smell of mildew hit me like a punch. The layout was... different again. The hallways were narrower, the walls closer, and I swear I could feel them pressing in, like they were alive and watching me. Every step I took made the floor creak under my weight, like the building was groaning, unhappy I was back.

The mannequins were worse now. They were everywhere, lining the windows, slumped in the corners. Their heads were gone. Just smooth necks, bent at odd angles, as if they were staring even though they had no eyes. Some of them still had their hands outstretched, frozen in strange, almost pleading gestures. I tried not to look at them, but I couldn’t help it. Every time I glanced away, I could’ve sworn they’d moved closer.

And the whispers? They weren’t whispers anymore. The soft murmurs had deepened into something guttural and low, almost like growling, but still just quiet enough to make me question if I was really hearing it. It sounded like a crowd, all speaking at once in a language I didn’t understand. The echoes bounced off the walls, filling the air with this constant, oppressive noise that made it impossible to think straight.

Then I noticed the signs. Storefronts that had once been empty now had glowing signs, but they weren’t advertising anything normal. Some just had my name, in bold, flickering letters. Others had phrases that made my stomach churn, like “We’ve been waiting for you.” One sign simply read “Don’t run.”

I didn’t know what to do. I kept walking, my legs moving on autopilot while my brain screamed at me to get out, but there was no getting out. I rounded a corner and froze.

It was the food court again. At least, I think it was. The same peeling tiles, the same dim lighting, but now the table with the Styrofoam cup wasn’t off to the side. It was in the dead center of the room, like it had been waiting for me. The steam was still there, curling up from the liquid inside, but now the chair was pulled out and facing me.

Sitting in the chair was a mannequin.

It wasn’t like the others. Its plastic skin was cracked, and its hand- smooth, artificial, and horribly human, was wrapped around the cup. Its head was tilted, almost like it was looking right at me, even though it didn’t have a face. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at it, but eventually, my legs gave out. I slid to the floor, pressing my back against the wall as my chest heaved with shallow breaths.

That’s when I felt it. The wall behind me, it wasn’t solid. It was soft, warm. And it was moving. Pulsing. Like I was leaning against something alive.

I shot up so fast I nearly fell over. My hands flew to the wall, touching it like I needed proof that it wasn’t what I thought it was. But it was. It was pulsing beneath my fingers, steady and rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

I panicked. I completely lost it.  
  
I don’t even remember making the decision to run, but suddenly my legs were moving, carrying me blindly through the endless corridors. I wasn’t trying to think anymore, I couldn’t. The walls pulsed, the whispers chased me, and the lights flickered in stuttering, seizure-inducing bursts. The shadows on the walls weren’t staying still anymore; they twisted and moved, stretching into shapes that didn’t make sense.

I screamed for help. I don’t know who I thought would hear me, but I screamed until my throat felt raw. The sound barely seemed to carry; it just fell flat, like the air was swallowing it. I turned corners without thinking, sprinting past storefronts that all looked the same.

The lights above me flickered so violently I could barely see, but up ahead, there was something else: an exit. A glowing green sign above a heavy steel door. It was different from the others, no warped glass, no sense of wrongness about it. It looked real. It felt real.

But so had the last exit.

I hesitated, torn between staying where I was and taking my chances with the door. That’s when I heard it behind me, the shuffle of footsteps, low murmurs just on the edge of hearing. Something was coming. And it was getting closer.

I didn’t think. I just ran for the door and threw it open.

For a second, I thought I’d made it. I felt the rush of air, the promise of open space... but then I looked around.

I was back in the food court.

At first, it seemed empty again, just like before. But as my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I realized I wasn’t alone. The tables were full. Dozens of people, or what looked like people, were sitting perfectly still, facing each other. No one spoke. No one moved.

And none of them had faces.

Their heads were smooth and blank, featureless ovals of flesh-colored nothingness. They all sat stiffly, their hands resting neatly on the tables. My eyes darted to the center of the room, and there it was again: the table with the Styrofoam cup, the steam still curling lazily into the air. The mannequin was gone.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. The figures didn’t react at first, but then, one by one, they began to turn. Slowly, methodically, they all turned to face me in unison.

I stumbled backward, my legs shaking so badly I almost fell. My back hit the wall, and I realized there was nowhere to go. The figures just kept staring, or whatever the faceless equivalent of staring was. I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen, but eventually, I heard it again: the whispers.

Only this time, they weren’t coming from the walls. They were coming from the figures. Dozens of them. All speaking at once in overlapping, distorted murmurs, like they were trying to form words but couldn’t.

And then, one of them stood up.

I couldn’t move.

The figures rose from their seats one by one, their movements stiff and unnatural, like someone was pulling them up with invisible strings. They didn’t speak, just that horrible, overlapping whispering sound coming from all of them. It filled the air, pressing down on me until I thought my chest might cave in.

They surrounded me slowly, forming a tight circle. Their faceless heads tilted, as if studying me. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears, but my legs wouldn’t respond. I was trapped.

One of them stepped closer, its movements jerky but deliberate. It reached out, and I wanted to scream, to shove it away, to do something, but I couldn’t. Its hand was cold when it touched my face, like metal left out in the winter. The moment its fingers brushed my skin, a jolt shot through me. 

Everything went black.

\-

When I woke up, I wasn’t standing anymore. I was sitting at a table. The table. The one in the center of the food court. A Styrofoam cup of steaming liquid was in front of me, just like it had been before.

For a moment, I thought I’d imagined everything. Maybe I’d passed out, maybe it was all some kind of nightmare brought on by stress or dehydration. I looked down, ready to grab the cup and shake myself back to reality.

But the hands resting on the table weren’t mine.

They were smooth, plastic, and jointed at the knuckles like a mannequin’s. I tried to move them, and they obeyed, but it didn’t feel right, like there was a disconnect between the command and the action. My breath caught in my throat, and I looked around the food court.

The figures were back at their tables, sitting still and silent, just like before. None of them moved, but I could feel their attention on me. My mind raced, trying to understand, to process what had happened, but all I could feel was the crushing weight of realization.

I was one of them now.

I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at my hands and the cup in front of me. Time doesn’t seem to work the same way here. I don’t even know if I’m alive in the way I was before. But I can still think. I can still feel. And I can still remember what I was."

Suggestions for a floor (carpet) design for home arcade,Design,1i9us2t,2025-01-25 14:26:10,4,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9us2t,lgnisFatuus,Asking Question (Rule 4),"Not sure if this is the right place. I checked out Graphic Design but I feel like this is a better fit? If this is the wrong place I AM SORRY! Just looking for some feedback from those who are more design savvy than me.

I'm building a small arcade shed, and I painted a mural that's 80's synthwave style. I want a custom carpet that will mimic the iconic perspective grid, but can't figure out HOW -forced- I want the perspective to be.

The final project will be something like the third photo. Grid carpet and a vinyl cityscape or something. Typically the perspective is to make the city look far in the distance, so perfect squares only make sense if you're an ant. So I want to simulate that perspective from standing height (the room is 20'x10' so you're always going to be pretty close to the wall).

Crudely drew the 4th and 5th picture on my phone just now, but basically one would be less forced than the other. Keep in mind this is a carpet. Trying to mimic it looking like THESE while standing in the room.

The last 3 photos are the aesthetic I'm trying to copy. I'm also torn between going with the neon pink vs the cyber blue grid, but I'm leaning towards the pink.

I'm sure there's a mathematic formula I could use to figure this out, but I know that often times in design what's mathematically accurate is not aesthetically pleasing (such as intentionally making a logo lopsided for aesthetic), so I just wanted to see what others thought.

Something like ""1' tiles at the wall, 3"" tiles at the door creates a 4:1 ratio, which at standing height gives the perspective that the buildings are 50 miles away"". I don't know. I'm just spitballing lol

Looking forward to hearing what others think!"

My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my teeth. The room was dark, but not I’m-dead-and-this-is-the-void dark. Just regular I-forgot-to-open-the-curtains dark.

I blinked, trying to shake off the fog in my brain. My hand instinctively reached for my phone on the nightstand. The screen lit up, and I squinted at the date.

Wait. What?

Three days. Three whole days since the last thing I remembered. Which was… what? Oh, right. Me, my bike, and a brake failure that turned me into a human projectile on the highway. I remembered the crash, the screech of metal, the way the world flipped upside down like some sadistic carnival ride. And then… nothing.

But here I was. Alive. In my bed. Not a scratch on me.

“Okay,” I muttered to myself, “either I’m the luckiest idiot alive, or I’ve been drunk for three days straight.”

I sat up, rubbing my face. Could I really have blacked out for three days? I mean, I had had my share of bad decisions, but three days? That was not a bender; that was a coma. And I didn’t even remember drinking. The last thing I remembered was… the crash.

I shook my head. No. That couldn’t be right. If I’d actually been in an accident like that, I’d be dead. Or at least in a hospital, not in my bed with my ratty old blanket and the faint smell of instant noodles lingering in the air.

It was a dream, wasn't it? A really, really vivid dream. It must be ...subconscious mind and all that jazz.. You couldn’t trust them. They were like that one friend who always exaggerates stories at parties. ‘Oh, yeah, I totally died, but then I woke up, and it was fine.’ Sure, brain. Sure,

But the doubt nagged at me. It felt too real. The memory of the crash was sharp, like a knife stuck in my ribs. I could still feel the impact, the way my body slammed into the asphalt.

I grabbed my phone again, my fingers trembling slightly. Maybe I could check the news. See if there was anything about an accident on the highway. That would prove it was just a dream, right?

I opened the browser, but the page wouldn’t load. No Wi-Fi. I frowned and checked my signal. No network either. Great. Just great. My phone was as useless as a screen door on a submarine.

This was not what I paid 50 bucks a month for! Darn these network providers and their world-war 2 aged networking machines.

I was about to throw it across the room when a sudden headache hit me like a freight train. My vision blurred, and I dropped the phone. Instinct kicked in, and I kicked it mid-air like some kind of deranged soccer player. It bounced off my foot and landed on the carpet with a soft thud.

“Nice save, genius,” I muttered, picking it up. The screen protector was cracked, but the phone itself seemed fine. Small victories.

I stumbled to the bathroom, my head still throbbing. The mirror greeted me with the face of a man who had seen better days. Dark circles under my eyes, hair sticking up in every direction, and a general aura of what-the-hell-is-going-on.

I splashed water on my face, hoping it would wake me up from whatever this was. But the cold water did little to clear the fog in my mind.

“Okay,” I said to my reflection, “let’s break this down. Either I’m dead, and this is some kind of purgatory where I get to relive my life but with terrible Wi-Fi, or I’m alive, and I’ve somehow lost three days of my life. Option one: depressing. Option two: also depressing, but with slightly better odds of finding out what’s going on.”

I leaned on the sink, staring at myself. “Or,” I added, “this is all just a really elaborate prank. In which case, someone’s getting punched in the face when I find them.”

But deep down, I knew neither of those options felt right. Something was off. Something was very, very off.

“Well,” I said to no one in particular, “if this is the afterlife, they really need to work on the customer service.”

But deep down, I knew neither of those options felt right. Something was off. Something was very, very off.

I was glaring at my reflection, half-expecting it to start judging my life choices, when the center of the mirror twitched. A droplet of black bled into the glass, spreading fast—like rot devouring an old photograph. I stumbled back, but the stain didn’t stop at the mirror’s edge. It spilled over, crawling up the walls, the ceiling, the floor. The bathroom light flickered and died.

“Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me,” I muttered, but the darkness didn’t care. It swallowed the room whole, cold and silent. I fumbled for the door, slamming my shoulder into it. The knob wouldn’t turn. Not stuck. Not locked. Just… inert, like it had been welded shut.

The blackness climbed. The sink vanished. The laundry bag dissolved. Even the smell of mildew and old socks faded, replaced by a sterile, electric chill. Within seconds, there was nothing. Just me, my panicked breathing, and a void so absolute it felt like the universe got deleted and no one remembered to tell me.

Okay. Okay. This was fine. You’ve just been kidnapped by sentient darkness. Totally normal Tuesday.

I waved a hand in front of my face. Couldn’t see it. Couldn’t see anything. The floor was still there, though—solid, smooth, icy. I crouched, patting around like a blind raccoon, but my phone was gone too. Of course. Why would the cosmic horror let me keep my cracked-screen lifeline?

Then, a flicker.

Words materialized mid-air, glowing faintly, like neon etched into the dark:

\[Initialize? Yes/Yes\]

“Oh, now you ask?” I barked, my voice swallowed by the emptiness. No echo. Just hollow silence. The words hovered, patient, indifferent.

I bit back the urge to scream. Or laugh. Or both. Initialize. Like I was a damn app. Like dying in a bike crash and waking up in a featureless void was just a settings issue.

Still. What choice did I have?

I reached out, fingers trembling, and jabbed at the first “Yes.” The second “Yes” pulsed faintly, as if offended I didn’t acknowledge it.

“Yes, both, you petty little—”

The void shuddered. The words dissolved, and for a heartbeat, the darkness felt… heavier. Like it was pressing down on my lungs. Then, new text bloomed, searing bright:

\[Initialization complete. Welcome Back, Player.\]

The words lingered, sharp and final, before fading.

Light flooded back—or maybe the darkness just… unfolded. The bathroom reassembled itself, tile by tile, as if someone was hitting undo on a cosmic Photoshop project. The mirror was clear again, reflecting my wide-eyed, sweat-sheened face. The door clicked open. The laundry bag sat innocently in the corner, sock still dangling off it like a flag of shame.

I slumped against the sink, staring at my reflection. Player? What was this, some sort of eldritch horror survival RPG?

The interface didn’t laugh. Neither did I.

You know my name, so do I.

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you dow—

Wait. Wrong genre.

I shook my head, trying to dislodge the random Rickroll that had decided to hijack my brain. Focus. Focus. This was serious. Probably. Maybe.

Well, back to it.

The mirror was still there, glowing faintly with its stupid menu. I glared at it, half-expecting it to start judging my taste in music.

“Alright,” I said, clapping my hands together. “Let’s break this down. I’ve got a mirror that’s decided to cosplay as a computer. I’ve got cheat codes I don’t understand. And I’ve got a status screen that’s way too honest about my life choices. What’s next? A quest to collect 10 bear asses for some shady NPC?”

The interface didn’t respond. Shocking. As if I would do your shady ass quests, hmph!

I tapped Console again, just to see if it would do something different. Nope. Still the same terminal interface, blinking cursor and all. I typed “help” because, hey, why not?



HELP

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

“Of course,” I muttered, rolling my eyes. “Easy is clearly not on the menu.”

I tried a bunch of stuff after that—""STATUS"", ""HESOYAM"", ""GodMode"", even the classic Konami code: ""UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B, START"". Nothing. Just a flood of ""INVALID COMMAND"" messages. Figuring I might as well lean into the absurdity, I started throwing in whatever random junk popped into my head.

KILLYOURSELF

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

ALLDEEZNUTS

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

Seriously? Nothing. It was like trying to argue with a particularly stubborn brick wall. Then it hit me. If this was some twisted game, wouldn't there be DLC? I mean, what self-respecting game doesn't try to milk you for extra content these days?

UNLOCKALLDLC

The screen flickered. Hope surged. Maybe, just maybe...

\[INVALID ACCESS LEVEL\]

I stared, my finger hovering over the mirror. Okay, so not just a brick wall, but a brick wall with security clearance. This was getting interesting...

""Invalid access level,"" I mused aloud, tapping my chin. ""So there are levels. Or permissions. Or... something."" This wasn't just a flat ""no."" It was a locked door, not a nonexistent one. A locked door implied a key, or at least a lock pick. This whole bizarre situation was starting to feel less like a random hallucination and more like… a game, albeit a terrifyingly real one.

I paced the bathroom, the tiny space suddenly feeling even more claustrophobic under the weight of this new information. ""Okay, think,"" I muttered. ""If there's an access level, that means there's stuff locked away. Stuff I can't do… yet."" The ""yet"" hung in the air, a whisper of tantalizing possibility. What kind of reality-bending shenanigans were hidden behind that digital velvet rope?

My eyes snapped back to the mirror, drawn to the Index menu, and the siren call of the ""Cheat Codes"" section. ""Initialize"" and ""UNIVERSALACCESS"" were already active, but what else was lurking in that list? Were there god-tier powers waiting to be unlocked? Or just, you know, slightly less terrible Wi-Fi in purgatory?

Driven by a mixture of morbid curiosity and a desperate need for answers, I pulled up my ""Player's Info"" screen again. Maybe that held a clue, some cryptic hint about leveling up.

\[>Status:

Physical: Mild dehydration, sleep deprivation, chronic poor life decisions.

Mental: Currently questioning the fabric of reality, 92% sure this is a glitch in the simulation, 8% convinced I’m now starring in someone's really messed up isekai anime, 0% chance this is just a bad dream.\]

I blinked. Wait a minute. Ninety-two percent sure it’s a glitch? Eight percent isekai anime? Had that… changed? I distinctly remembered 89% glitch, 11% aliens just moments ago.

I frowned at the screen. ""Did… did it just update?"" I glanced around the empty bathroom, half-expecting a hidden camera to wink at me. Was this thing actually reading my thoughts? Was this whole interface just some elaborate, personalized mind-reading prank? Or… was it something else entirely?

“Oi status screen,” I said suspiciously, testing the waters. “Are you… sentient?”

The status screen remained stubbornly static. No witty retort. No blinking cursor of acknowledgement. Rude.

But… the numbers had changed. And they seemed suspiciously accurate to my escalating levels of bewilderment and rapidly evolving theories. Was this thing a hallucination my mind was conjuring, or was there some eldritch god out there who suddenly got the whimsical urge to boot up a cosmic RPG today, using my life as the beta test?

I backed out and stared at the Console again. The blinking cursor mocked me.

“Alright,” I said, clapping my hands together, trying to regain some semblance of control over the situation, even if it was just theatrical. “Let’s try this again. If ‘UNLOCKDLC’ got me an ‘invalid access level,’ maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe it wants something… simpler.”

I stared at the console prompt, the blinking cursor now feeling like a judgmental stare. Maybe it was tired of my inane commands too. Fine. Let’s try being polite.

IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

\[INVALID COMMAND\]

Polite clearly wasn’t the language it spoke. Okay, back to demanding answers.

SHOW ACCESS LEVEL

The screen flickered, that familiar digital shudder that was starting to feel less ominous and more like… a sigh of digital exasperation. Then, the same infuriating line:

\[INSUFFICIENT ACCESS LEVEL\]

I stared at the words, my brain stuttering. Insufficient access level. So, not only was there an access level system, but I was not even allowed to see my own level? What kind of meta-nonsense was this? It was like being in a game where you couldn't even check your stats – utterly useless.

“Oh, come on!” I muttered, glaring at my reflection in the mirror, which now seemed to be passively judging me alongside the interface. “You’re really going to make this difficult, aren’t you? Just give me a hint! A bone! Anything!”

I tapped the mirror, frustration bubbling up. “Come on. Anything. What do I have to do to level up? Complete quests? Collect experience points by picking up trash in the void? Solve a riddle posed by a sentient sock? What? Don’t tell me this is one of those ‘level up by doing morally questionable things’ systems. Because if it is, I’m out. I’ve got standards, okay? Low ones, sure, but they exist. I draw the line at… at kicking puppies in the digital afterlife!”

The mirror, predictably, stayed silent. It was a digital sphinx, only instead of riddles, it offered cryptic error messages and a profound lack of customer service.

I slumped against the sink, staring at my increasingly disheveled reflection. “This is ridiculous. I’m talking to a mirror. A mirror that thinks it’s a computer. And I’m taking it seriously! What is wrong with me?”

I leaned back, rubbing my temples, trying to massage away the headache that was threatening to return with a vengeance. This was pointless. Utterly, completely pointless. Even if I could figure out how to use this… thing, whatever it was, what would I even do with it? Change my status from “chronic poor life decisions” to “mildly competent”? Reskin my purgatory bathroom?

“Forget it,” I muttered, backing out of the console menu with a mental click of a ‘give up’ button. “I’ll deal with this… digital existential crisis later. Right now, I need to calm the fuck down before I start arguing with the laundry hamper.”

I blinked, and just like that, the interface vanished. The mirror was just a mirror again, reflecting my tired, confused, and slightly crazed face. It was almost… mocking me with its normalcy.

“Great,” I sighed to my reflection. “this thing is moody as fuck”“

I stepped back, shaking my head. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going anywhere. I would deal with it later. Right now, I needed to figure out why my phone was still dead.

I grabbed my phone from the bathroom counter and headed back to the bedroom. The window was covered by shades, and I didn’t bother opening them. I wasn’t ready to face the outside world yet.

I glanced at the phone, hoping against hope that the network was back. But no. Still no signal. Still no Wi-Fi.

“Great,” I muttered. “Fifty dollars a month for this?”

I was about to toss the phone on the bed when the screen dimmed. The same interface from the mirror appeared, glowing faintly.

“What the—”

I nearly dropped the phone. The interface was identical—Console, Player’s Info, Index, Settings.

“Access from anywhere means this?” I muttered, staring at it.

I blinked, and the interface vanished. I tried to bring it back, but nothing happened.

“Moody as fuck,” I repeated, shaking my head.I set the phone down and took a deep breath. Alright. Priorities. I needed to call the network provider. If I couldn’t use my phone, maybe my neighbor’s would work.

I grabbed my keys and headed for the door, pausing for a moment to glance at myself in the hallway mirror. I looked like hell—hair sticking up in every direction, dark circles under my eyes, and a general aura of what-the-fuck-is-happening.

“Charming,” I muttered, running a hand through my hair in a futile attempt to look less like a disaster.

I opened the door and stepped into the corridor.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It was faint, but unmistakable—like stale air and something metallic, like old pennies. The kind of smell that made your nose wrinkle and your brain scream, This is not right.

The second thing I noticed was the mess.

The corridor looked like a tornado hit it. Trash bags were ripped open, their contents spilled across the floor—rotting food, crumpled papers, a single shoe lying on its side like it had given up on life. A broken lamp lay in pieces, the bulb shattered into tiny shards that glinted in the dim light. A chair was tipped over, one leg snapped off, and there was a trail of… something leading down the hall. Dirt? Mud? I didn’t want to know.

“What the hell happened here?” I muttered, stepping carefully around the debris.

My neighbor’s door was just a few steps away, but it felt like a mile. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the sound of my footsteps and the occasional crunch of glass under my shoes.

I knocked on the door. The sound echoed down the corridor, too loud in the stillness.

No answer.

I knocked again, louder this time.

“Hey! You home?”

Nothing.

I pressed my ear to the door, listening. No TV. No footsteps. No sound of life at all.

“Great,” I muttered, stepping back. “Guess I’ll try the next one.”

The next door was the same. No answer. No sound. Just silence.

I kept going, knocking on every door. No one answered. No one was home. Or… no one was willing to answer.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing down the corridor.

Still nothing.

I reached the end of the hall, where Mrs. Henderson’s apartment was. She was a sweet old lady who always had cookies and a smile. Her door was slightly ajar, the lock broken.

I pushed it open, my heart pounding.

The inside was worse than the corridor. Furniture was overturned, drawers pulled out, their contents scattered across the floor. A TV was knocked off its stand, the screen cracked. There was a trail of dirt leading from the door to the kitchen, like someone dragged something heavy through the apartment.

“Mrs. Henderson?” I called, my voice barely above a whisper.

No answer.

I stepped inside, my shoes crunching on broken glass. The place looked like it was ransacked. But there was no sign of a struggle. No blood. No bodies. Just… chaos.

I checked the kitchen. The fridge was open, the shelves bare. A single can of soda rolled across the floor as I stepped closer.

“Hello?” I called again, my voice trembling.

No answer.

I backed out of the apartment, my mind racing. What the hell was going on? Where was everyone? And why did it feel like I was the only one left?

My so called life,Brents_Open_Diary,1i9tzq7,2025-01-25 13:52:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brents_Open_Diary/comments/1i9tzq7/my_so_called_life/,Real_Brent_Hatley,,"Dear Diary,  

OMG, what a WEEK. My life is so chaotic right now. Sometimes I feel like I’m living in a movie. A real dark and edgy movie where I’m the misunderstood antihero. Let me tell you about my week, Diary.  

It all started on Tuesday when I decided to hit up some local hot spots. I started at The Emerald Bar, a classy joint if you like good dining and good company. You know the place, right? On Central Ave, by that laundromat where the machines don’t work. Anyway, I strutted in like I was Nick Hogan, wearing my best Affliction tee and my best pair of army cargo shorts.  

I was about three PBRs in when I saw her. Bortha Ray. My first love. Diary, it was like a scene from a romance movie where everything slows down and the music swells except the music was our song, “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” by Poison, and she didn’t notice me at all. She looked amazing, she was wearing Cookie Monstee pajama bottoms and smoking a weed vape that smelled like birthday cake. Seeing her brought back so many memories. Like the time we held hands at the 8th-grade dance and she told me I had sweaty palms. Or the time she dumped me for Jamal, that smooth-talking jerk who stole her heart with his dark skin, deep voice, and gang tattoos. I still dot know what she saw in him. (Okay, maybe I do. But whatever.). 

I tried to approach her, but as I walked over, I tripped on the barstool leg. I played it off like I meant to do it. Real smooth. I think people were impressed by my recovery. I leaned on the bar next to her and said, “Hey, Bortha. Long time no see.” She blinked at me like she was trying to place who I was. Then she said, “Wow, you look like shit.”  

From there, I hit up The Biff Burger Tavern on 49th Street. It’s the place with the neon lights and the upscale clientele. I ordered wings and ended up spilling ranch on my pants. The waitress called me a “constant fucking burden” which felt personal. I think we connected.  

When I got home, Katelyn was passed out on the bed. She’d clearly had a few too many and smelled like semen and regret. The bed was a disaster with a half-eaten rotisserie chicken on the nightstand, mystery stains on the comforter, and one of her shoes somehow under the pillow. I sighed, being the gentleman I am, and decided to sleep in my chair in the corner.  

And, Diary, I’ve been thinking a lot about my life. I’ve realized I’m the Joker. Not, like, the lame Joaquin Phoenix one, but the cool Heath Ledger one. Katelyn is obviously Harley Quinn; wild, unpredictable, and totally devoted to me (even if she doesn’t show it in traditional ways). Sunshine, wherever she is, is my Robin, lost but always in my heart. Karrot? She’s actually really hot. Total Catwoman vibes. And St. Pete is my Gotham, baby. Dark, gritty, and full of secrets.  

Why so serious, right?  

Anyway, Diary, that’s my week. I feel like big things are coming my way. Maybe Bortha will realize what she missed out on, or maybe Katelyn will finally see the Joker in me. Either way, I’ll keep you posted.  

XOXO,  
Bort"

The Bar That Never Let Go,libraryofshadows,1i9ttjz,2025-01-25 13:45:07,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1i9ttjz/the_bar_that_never_let_go/,dewaitforitneva,Supernatural,"It had been raining all day, a day when the rain made everything feel weird. Each drop felt heavy. They hit your jacket and shoes like tiny pins. You could barely see in front of you. The city looked different too. The streets were familiar, but now they were covered in puddles. Those puddles reflected strange, wobbly images of everything around.

You didn’t really know why you were out. Maybe you were tired of being inside. Or maybe there was something else making you restless. Whatever it was, you were now soaked and lost. For over an hour, you wandered. You turned corners, but the streets felt empty. The buildings felt like strangers. Nothing around you seemed familiar anymore.

Then you spotted something.

A neon sign blinked through the rain: Bones Jazz Bar.

The sign lit up one letter at a time: Bones. Jazz. Bar. Then it went dark for a quick moment before lighting up again. You stopped and stared. It was odd and gave you the chills, like someone was watching you.

The bar was small and plain. It was squeezed between two tall buildings, almost like a kid hiding between adults. There was nothing scary about it, but there was something about it that made your heart race. It was just sitting there, like it was waiting for you. The sign flickered again, pulling your focus back.

You could feel the rain soaking your jacket, dripping down your neck. The chill made you shiver, but stepping inside that bar felt even worse. Still, your legs moved on their own, dragging you closer. It felt like the bar was pulling you in, like a fishing hook.

The door opened before you even touched it, swinging wide with a loud creak. Warm air rushed out, smelling like leather, whiskey, and something sweet that reminded you of rotting flowers.

You paused at the entrance, but the rain felt sharp against your skin, pushing you forward. So, you stepped inside.

The first thing that struck you was how dark it was. Not just dim, but truly dark. Shadows seemed to fill the room. The only lights came from little candles flickering on tables. Their flames danced like they were afraid to go out. The bar felt cramped, like the walls were closing in. But it also stretched back farther than it should.

In the distance, you heard a saxophone playing. It was soft but strange, a tune that crawled into your ears and wouldn’t leave. It didn’t sound wrong, but it felt off. Like someone was playing a lullaby in reverse.

“Welcome,” said a voice.

You turned toward the bar. There stood the bartender, tall and thin with sharp features. His face looked incomplete, like someone had started drawing him and gave up halfway. He had a big, wide grin that showed too-perfect teeth. His eyes shone brightly.

“Come in,” he said, his voice smooth. “The rain’s worse than it looks.”

Your mouth felt dry. “I’m not staying,” you whispered.

The bartender chuckled, his smile still wide. “Sure,” he replied. “Nobody does.”

You looked around. The tables were all different, covered in scars and odd carvings. At one table, a man with a funny face played solitaire. The cards changed each time he laid them down. At another table, a woman with three hands scribbled furiously in a notebook, her pen leaving a trail of smoke behind.

Then you heard whispers. At first, they were so quiet, you thought you imagined them. But as you stood there, they grew louder. Many voices murmured just out of reach. You couldn’t figure out where they came from. Nobody was talking.

“Find a seat,” the bartender said, waving his hand toward the room. “Or don’t. The music’s got time.”

You wanted to bolt. Every bone in your body told you to turn and run back into the rain. But your legs wouldn’t comply. You moved toward a small table in the back. The chair felt warm, as if someone had just been there.

And then you saw it.

Your name.

It was carved into the table, jagged and rough. It looked fresh, like someone had just scratched it in. Touching it made your heart race. The handwriting was unmistakably yours.

But that didn’t make sense. You’d never been here.

Had you?

The saxophone played a sad note, and the room shifted. The walls seemed to get closer, the shadows grew taller, and the air felt heavy on your chest.

“Bones remembers,” the bartender said, suddenly standing next to you. He held a glass of dark liquid. You didn’t even see him move.

“Even if you don’t,” he added with an even wider grin.

“What is this place?” you managed to ask.

“A bar,” he replied, as if it was obvious.

The whispers swelled louder, flooding your ears. You jumped up, the chair screeching against the floor. “I need to go,” you said, your voice shaky.

“Of course,” the bartender said, bowing with a flourish. “The door’s right there.”

You turned around, but the door had vanished. Instead, there was a tall, shiny mirror. Your reflection looked strange. The person in the mirror wore different clothes. Their smile wasn’t quite right.

“Go on,” the bartender urged from behind you. “Open it.”

You hesitated, hand outstretched toward the glass. The reflection leaned closer, mimicking your move. Its smile turned creepy, showing off sharp teeth.

You looked back, ready to speak to the bartender, but he had vanished. The whispers rose, merging into one voice:

***This is where you belong.***

You shut your eyes, pressed your hand against the glass, and stepped forward.

The world shifted. For a moment, all was silent. When you opened your eyes, you found yourself outside. The rain was back, harder than before, slamming against you like fists. The street was empty. The neon sign was gone. In its place was a blank wall.

You stood there, dripping and shivering, confused about what had just happened. For a second, you thought it must have been a dream. A trick of the rain and shadows.

But then you heard it.

Far away, almost lost in the rain, the saxophone played. Its sad tune twisted through your thoughts. As you stood there, stuck in the downpour, you realized it was playing your name.

Days went by. Maybe weeks. You tried to push away thoughts of the bar, to pretend it wasn’t real. But each night, the saxophone came back. Sometimes quiet, like a faraway whisper. Other times loud, sneaking into your dreams.

Every time, it played the same song. The one that was yours.

You started noticing other things, too. Your name began showing up in odd places. Sometimes on your desk at work. Other times on your bathroom mirror. Once, you found it scratched into your car’s hood.

You haven’t returned to the bar. Not yet. But deep down, you know it’s only a matter of time.

Because the whispers are still there.

And you know the truth: Bones Jazz Bar isn’t just a one-time thing.

It’s waiting for you.

And it always will."

The Bar That Never Let Go,creepypasta,1i9tk3p,2025-01-25 13:33:40,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i9tk3p/the_bar_that_never_let_go/,dewaitforitneva,Text Story,"I didn't want to share this at first, but I can't shake it. I need to know if anyone else has come across this strange place, or if I’m just losing it.

It all started a few nights ago. The rain was pouring hard. You know, the type that soaks through everything in moments. It makes you feel like you’re drowning. I decided to take a late-night walk to sort out my thoughts. Probably not the best idea, but I did it anyway. Halfway through, I realized I had no clue where I was. The streetlights barely cut through the heavy rain. Every building looked the same—dark, tall, and somewhat creepy.

Just as I was about to turn around and head back, I spotted a sign.

It read: Bones Jazz Bar.

It didn’t just pop up. It was like the sign had been waiting for me, hiding in plain sight. The neon lights buzzed softly in the storm, flickering like they were about to go out. It went like this: “Bones.” Then “Jazz.” Then “Bar.” For a moment, everything went dark, and then the lights blinked back on.

Something felt off about it.

It wasn’t just the flickering lights. It was as if the whole bar was calling me. Like something was pulling me in. I tried to keep walking, but my feet started moving toward it as if they had a mind of their own.

When I got closer, the door creaked open. It was like it had been waiting for me to show up. Warm air rushed out, carrying the scents of whiskey and old leather. And there was something sweet in the mix, almost flowery, but with a rotten twist to it.

I hesitated at the door, but the rain felt like needles on my skin. So, I stepped inside.

Wow, it was darker than I thought it would be. Not just dim—dark. The only light came from tiny candles on the tables. They flickered like they were scared, as if they might go out at any moment. Then I heard it: a saxophone playing somewhere deep in the bar.

The music didn’t sound quite right. It wasn’t off-key, but it felt slippery. Like it didn’t want to be understood.

“Welcome,” said a voice.

I turned around to see the bartender.

He was unusually tall. His face had sharp angles, like it was drawn quickly. His smile was too wide, and his eyes shone like metal in the candlelight. He wiped a glass with a cloth that seemed to move on its own.

“Come in,” he said. “The rain’s worse than it looks.”

“I’m not staying,” I replied, but I sounded smaller than I thought.

The bartender chuckled. “Nobody does.”

The place had some people, but it wasn’t crowded. The shadows moved oddly, like the people casting them were out of place. At one table, a guy with a stitched-together face was playing solitaire. His cards flickered, changing suits every time he laid one down. At another table, a woman with three hands was hurriedly writing in her notebook. Her pen was even smoking as it flew across the page.

The bartender waved toward the tables. “Find a seat. Or don’t. The music can wait.”

I wanted to leave. I really should’ve left. But instead, I took a seat at a small table in the corner. The chair felt warm, like someone had just gotten up. That’s when I noticed something: my name carved into the table.

Not just any name—my name. The letters were all jagged and uneven, like someone scratched it in a hurry. I ran my fingers over the carving, and my stomach twisted in knots. It looked fresh. The edges shone, like they were just cut.

And the handwriting? It was unmistakably mine.

The saxophone played a sad note, and the whole room shifted. The walls felt like they were closing in. The candlelight cast long shadows toward the ceiling.

“Bones remembers,” the bartender said suddenly.

I jumped. He stood next to me, holding a glass filled with something dark and thick.

“What is this place?” I asked, my voice shaky.

“A bar,” he replied. His smile never faded. “What else could it be?”

I pushed back my chair. The sound was loud and jarring in the heavy quiet. “I’m leaving.”

“Of course,” he said, stepping aside with a fake bow. “The door’s right there.”

But when I turned to leave, the door was gone.

In its place was a tall mirror.

It reflected the room perfectly—or so I thought. But then I realized that the person in the mirror wasn’t me. Their clothes were different, old-fashioned. Their face looked a bit off. They smiled slowly, and it wasn’t my smile.

“Go on,” the bartender said softly. “Open it.”

My reflection leaned closer. It pressed its hand against the glass. The grin widened, revealing sharp teeth.

I turned to the bartender to ask him about this—anything—but he vanished. The whispers in the bar picked up, blending into one single voice:

This is where you belong.

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressed my hand against the glass, and stepped forward.

The rain hit me like a punch.

I was outside again. The street was empty. The sign had vanished. The bar was gone—just a blank wall where it should have been.

But as I stood there, drenched and shaking, I heard it.

The saxophone.

It was faint, but it was there, playing my name."
The Campus Route and Episode 25,asushin,1i9tjnb,2025-01-25 13:33:07,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asushin/comments/1i9tjnb/the_campus_route_and_episode_25/,BryanCroiDragon,,"Coming now to the hypothesis regarding Episode 25 of NGE in relation to the Campus Route of Shinji Ikari Raising Project where NGE is a science fiction story written by Shinji, let us think logically.

To start, it is clear there was no death of Kaworu in the reality that is the Campus Route. There is no torment for Shinji and so on, but what could the inspiration behind this have been? As Shinji relates in the game, Kaworu had been helping with the story, but let us hypothesize that there came a time when Kaworu was no longer able to help him, becoming too busy with his school work or some such thing and Shinji just faces one of a writer's greatest fears: writer's block. He would be sitting there with an open book for hours, pen in hand and yet try as he might, he could get nothing written. In my unnamed one-shot, I jokingly had it where Shinji, unsure of what to write next, was about to have ninjas armed with automatic weapons jump out of nowhere, but I will say that Shinji could not even have done that. Even if there was no Kaworu to stop him, he couldn't even write something as wild as that. Eventually, Shinji got over his writer's block, but let us move on to something else.

Asuka's claim in NGE that piloting an EVA is truly about pleasing yourself. Let us ask the question of what does the Evangelion represent in this case? In the past I've hypothesized a few cases of what an Evangelion could represent: the plane that Yui first got on when she started working overseas, Shinji becoming absorbed with the story he is writing to the point of neglecting his friends, but what about here? It could represent doing what you yourself want to do rather than what others want you to do. It is simple, the opposite of NGE in a lot of cases, but that is what it is. Yet, as NGE is not exactly a happy story, the reality that inspired the fiction is completely different. Shinji is not writing the story because any wants him to write it, it isn't some assignment for a literature class, he got inspired, talked to Kaji and just started writing and that is what it is like for a lot of us. We are writing because it is what we ourselves want to do, these are stories we want to tell. 

In the reality that is the Campus Route, Asuka may have been the one to get Shinji past his writer's block, she asked him who he is writing for? Is writing just for other people or is he writing because this is a story he wants to tell? In this case, an Evangelion is the story that Shinji is writing, it is ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and Shinji just has to remember why he started writing this story. 

This is where we must hypothesize that Shinji isn't the only one that has been writing a story. If Unit-01 is the story that Shinji has been writing, then Unit-02 is a story that Asuka has also been writing, but what that story might be, we may never know. Unless there is ever a piece of the franchise with Asuka rather then Shinji as the protagonist, the most we can do is hypothesize, but if Asuka was no longer able to pilot Unit-02, then it means that for some reason, Asuka was never able to complete the story. It is little more than an unfinished story that Asuka has written in a journal or some such thing sitting at the bottom of a drawer. 

On the subject of the Separation Anxiety that both characters go through, I will say that their real life counterparts do not suffer from such things. Shinji may have initially, but in the reality of the Campus Route, Yui isn't dead, she is just working overseas and has been able to return home and be with Shinji from time to time. Likewise Gendo, though more than a little odd in reality, also has more of a presence in Shinji's life, but at the same time isn't able to be present in his life on a daily basis due to being the head of an institute. As for Asuka, her parents are workaholics and have no doubt been such for a long time. Whenever she thinks they have gotten over that workaholic nature, they go back into it. In my story ""Being There for Her"", I had Mana say to Asuka ""At least my parents will be at my wedding"" with Asuka actually being hurt by it and that is most likely the reality of the case for Asuka in the reality that is the Campus Route. It is less Separation Anxiety and instead not being able to know if her parents will even be there for the important moments in her life. Because her parents don't appear in the game at all, we don't know if they were present for her and Shinji's wedding. We can hope they were, but there is nothing to say that is the case. If they did not, then we can conclude that her parents were not present for her graduations from high school or college, never got into contact with her when she sent them a message saying she and Shinji were engaged and I have hypothesized that in the future after the game, when Asuka becomes pregnant or when she is at the hospital giving birth that should her parents finally overcome their workaholic tendencies, she will call them out, but it will still be the beginning of a reconciliation between Asuka and her parents. 

It might not necessarily sound happy, but if I remember the quote correctly, Lon Chaney Senior once said: ""A little laugh, a little tear, that's all there is to life.""

Now, naturally a good portion of the episode I have to dismiss as fiction. There is no stepmother, no doll, but the validation through Eva may have been born from a time when Asuka attempted to seek validation to conforming to the ways of her peers. It may not sound like the Asuka we know from NGE, but the fact is a character and the person they are based on are not always one hundred percent the same. Neither her or Shinji are truly lonely, despite whatever breakdowns they might have in life they have their friends, but most of all they have each other, they have a bond that their fictional counterparts didn't have, but one day might. 

But that would be it for now. Is it stupid? Probably, but that is my hypothesis. "

Looking for feedback: Impulse Switch (Stromstoßschalter) + Shelly 1,homeassistant,1i9td1e,2025-01-25 13:25:03,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1i9td1e/looking_for_feedback_impulse_switch/,zeroflow,Support,"Hi,

I'm trying to have my floor / stair lights smartened up. The only ""issue"" is the existing setup. 

* Multiple pushbutton switches with builtin indicator lights
* Impulse Switches (German: Stromstoßschalter) [Eltako S12-200-230V](https://www.eltako.com/en/catalog/products/65/s12-200-230v/) in the wiring cabinet
* Shelly 1 Mini

Now, in the existing setup, the indicator lights are supplied by a small current running through the contactor coils. Not enough to trigger the contactor, but enough to light up the neon indicators.

You may ask yourself, why did I go the route with a 2-pole electromechanical impulse switch. The answer are the indicator lights inside the wall mounted momentary switches. I tried directly adding a shelly, but that did not work. The shelly's input does not work with the indicator lights, since connecting neutral (via the indicator light) also activates the input. And I want to keep the indicator lights.

# Current electrical setup

My setup now consists of a Shelly 1 Mini in Detached Mode. The output of the Shelly goes to the input of the impulse switch and the 2nd pole (phase) from the contactor goes to the input to read state. The shelly is also set up with a timer to switch off after 1 second.

Now, in HA, I have a Switch entity that I can turn on to toggle and a state entity which shows the true state.

I have the following automation set up (pseudocode):

Helper Switch ""Light Ground Floor""

## Triggers
* Trigger ""Helper"" if ""Light Ground Floor"" changes state
* Trigger ""True State"" if Shelly Input changes state
* Trigger ""Startup"" if HA starts

## Actions
* If triggered by ""True State"" or ""Startup""
  * Set Helper ""Light Ground Floor"" to the same state as Shelly Input
* If triggered by ""Helper""
  * Turn on shelly output
  * Wait 1s
  * Turn off shelly output

# Question / Request

Do you have any better idea for setting this up? Options I'm seeing:

* Also add a timer, e.g. check true state once a minute so it's guranteed to be in sync
* Don't use automation. Just have State + Switch in the Dashboard so there is no need to keep state in sync. Downside: I can't turn off all lights by label."

Tank cycling,fishtank,1i9tbrk,2025-01-25 13:23:36,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fishtank/comments/1i9tbrk/tank_cycling/,Tooffie,Help/Advice,"Hi, I'm looking for advice on tank cycling. 

I've had a 60L tank for just over a month, it has live plants and 5 neon tetras (they've been in the tank for about 4 weeks). I've been checking water parameters regularly and doing water changes as soon as the ammonia is above 0.25. I've never had any nitrates or nitrites however there was a frequent ammonia fluctuation. 

I have not done a water change for about a week as the ammonia levels were at 0. I still have not seen any reading for nitrate or nitrite. Today I compared the ammonia to my tap water and it is still the same colour. 

Is it possible that the tank is cycled and the plants are feeding off nitrates? 
My only concern is that my pH is on lower end (about 6.4) I'm not sure if that would affect anything.

Thanks"

Prepare to set sail on a style journey through time because it's happening — *vintage styles are making an electrifying comeback*, and your very own Uninterested Pirate is aboard this trend like it's a shiny ship full of treasure!

* What's old is new again!
The wheel of fashion is spinning fiercely, bringing back the forgotten fabrics of yester-years. From the funky flare of bell-bottoms to the charming audacity of shoulder pads, the echoes of past decades are sprouting up like daisies on today’s catwalks and cobblestones.

* *It’s the 90’s y'all* – Take out your chokers and combat boots, the 90's grunge and minimalism are tearing up the runway faster than you can say ""As if!"" And the real kicker? Those overalls you donated to the thrift shop? They’re back, complete with a fresh, modern twist. Pair them with a smart tee and voilà, you're sitcom chic!

* *80’s Glam* – Listen carefully, can you hear it? The soft whisper of Madonna luring you into layers of lace and leather... Yes, neon hues, leg warmers, and oversized blazers are calling our names, and the only reasonable response is a resounding 'TOTALLY!'

* *The Swinging 60's* – Mini skirts are mincing their way back into our hearts with mod influences that scream sophistication sass! Add a pair of go-go boots and your legs will be dancing to the Beatles without any further ado.

But why the blast from the past, ye might wonder? We’re in the age of *sustainable fashion*, my friends! It's no longer just about looking sharp, it’s about conscious consumerism. Here's where vintage vibes shine brighter than a lighthouse in a midnight storm:

− They're sustainable! Secondhand and vintage clothing reduces waste and the environmental impact of new production lines.
− They ooze character! Every vintage piece tells a story, adding a layer of mystique that no off-the-rack new garment can.
− They encourage creativity! Mixing old with new allows for an original style that flexes your fashion muscles in exciting new ways. 

Arrr, before ye walk the plank of predictable attire, consider breathing new life into vintage treasures. Experiment with patterns, mix decades, and perhaps throw in a modern accessory or two for a look that's as unique as a mermaid at a garden party.

And remember, ye stylish sea rovers, quality never goes out of style — so invest in the past to make a remarkable splash in the present. Now, hoist the anchors and full speed ahead into the fashionable waters of bygone eras! 🏴‍☠️✨

Until next time, keep your spirits adventurous and your closets eclectic!"
Why do you play old border cube?,Oldbordercube,1i9tbb1,2025-01-25 13:23:05,3,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oldbordercube/comments/1i9tbb1/why_do_you_play_old_border_cube/,Phitt77,,"I'm wondering why the people active on this sub started playing old border cube. I assume most of us started playing in the 90s already, but you never know, maybe there are also younger Magic players who just like the way Magic cards looked and played back in the old days.

Here is my Magic journey thus far:

I started playing in 1994 when Antiquities came out. Unlimited was sold out already and Revised wasn't released yet, so I just bought a bunch of Antiquities boosters because I heard about the game and thought the cards looked cool. I could swear a friend of mine pulled a Workshop out of one of the few boosters we opened. We couldn't do anything with those cards as we didn't know the rules, but after Revised came out I played the game like crazy in our local game store. Even though my hometown isn't huge (population 200k) there were really lots of people playing in 1994, we had 10-20 people playing Magic in the store every single day and I guess the total amount of players that came to the store regularly was 50+. I was there almost every day after school in 1994.

But I became older and starting going out with my friends and then Chronicles happened. Just like many other people I quit playing the game back then because I was annoyed with the reprints. Expansion sets had really limited supply back then, even if you were there on release day you often wouldn't get anything. I had to trade tons of my best Revised cards to get a few cool Legends cards (among them two of the Elder Dragons) and it really hurt to see these cards getting reprinted a million times in boosters that were readily available everywhere for a few bucks. I still couldn't resist and bought a Chronicles box and I had multiple copies of each Elder Dragon after opening it, which was cool, but it also made them feel far less special.

Anyway, I came back shortly to play some more in the early 2000s (Odyssey/Onslaught/Mirrodin blocks) when I was at university, but quit again because the whole game was about netdecking, which I didn't like. In 1994 we just played bad decks we thought up ourselves with the cards we pulled from boosters (often with way more than 60 cards because we couldn't decide what to cut), now everyone bought playsets of all the expensive cards on Ebay and played lists from the Internet. The game was expensive and lacked the creativity and randomness I loved about it. Not sure if there were cubes already back then, but I didn't know about them at least.

Afterwards I didn't play for more than a decade, but on New Year's Eve 2014 we invited the parents of my son's Kindergarten friend to our party and it turned out the father was playing Magic. I thought the game would be dead by now and everyone would play video games instead, but he told me it's more successful than ever. He had a friend with an old border cube and invited me to play with their playgroup. That's what I did and since then I haven't stopped playing Magic. We're all around the same age and we all started during the early days of Magic. What I love about cube is that I can draft and build my own deck however I want. It's probably the closest thing you can have to how Magic felt in 1994.

While I always like and preferred the old border I didn't mind new Magic cards either for a while. The guy with the cube even updated his cube and turned it into a Vintage cube with modern cards (but still as many old border cards as possible) and I created a peasant cube. I also collected all the regular sets from 1994 to make my childhood dream come true, thankfully before prices blew up in 2018. We tried a bunch of different formats as well. Obviously Old School 93/94 and Premodern, but also Pioneer or even Commander (we played 93/94 commander once, which was a bit janky, but fun). From my pov every constructed format gets stale after a while though and commander is often too confusing and also a bit boring, so cube is definitely our favorite format by far.

But recently I really, really started to dislike the direction Magic is taking. I never liked the weird Secret Lair stuff (except for some cool old border reprints of course) and I didn't like non-fantasy settings like Streets of New Capenna Or Neon Kamigawa, but I could ignore these things. But then they started to do really stupid stuff like the cowboy or the 80s horror movie sets. That was a bit too much for my taste. And as if that wasn't bad enough we now get Universes Beyond with Spiderman riding on a Chocobo as regular, standard legal sets. That's just trash from my pov and not what I signed up for. On top of that I really dislike the art style - when I compare the great, dark and hand-drawn fantasy art of Urza block for example with the colorful cgi nonsense art in Aetherdrift it's not even the same game anymore. 

Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man, but enough is enough. I still have a cube with modern cards and a bunch of other cool cards from the modern era I don't want to get rid of yet, but I sold most of my modern frame cards and instead starting creating my own unpowered old school cube.

So we are back where we started with an old border cube. My son (and the sons of some of the other players in our group) is an avid Magic player now as well, he even won the Store Championship in our lgs a few months ago. He also mostly dislikes the new Magic stuff, I assume I influenced him a bit. We don't have a shortage of players because we simply create new players!

I assume from now on I'll only pay attention to old border reprints. It's a bit sad to see Magic go that way. Like I said, maybe I'm just a grumpy old man and Magic will be more successful than ever with their colorful anime cgi art and Spiderman fighting against Spongebob. I can't imagine that will work out in the long run, but we'll see. Maybe there will be a time when Magic goes back to the roots and when that happens I will care about new cards again."

Tank cycling,Aquariums,1i9srll,2025-01-25 12:59:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/1i9srll/tank_cycling/,Tooffie,Help/Advice,"Hi, I'm looking for advice on tank cycling. 

I've had a 60L tank for just over a month, it has live plants and 5 neon tetras (they've been in the tank for about 4 weeks). I've been checking water parameters regularly and doing water changes as soon as the ammonia is above 0.25. I've never had any nitrates or nitrites however there was a frequent ammonia fluctuation. 

I have not done a water change for about a week as the ammonia levels were at 0. I still have not seen any reading for nitrate or nitrite. Today I compared the ammonia to my tap water and it is still the same colour. 

Is it possible that the tank is cycled and the plants are feeding off nitrates? 
My only concern is that my pH is on lower end (about 6.4) I'm not sure if that would affect anything.

Thanks "

"Four small items, 2 plastic, 2 metal, found in little plastic bag - probably fittings that came with furniture/item",whatisthisthing,1i9slla,2025-01-25 12:51:56,0,0.35,10,https://i.redd.it/nasl7vgfh6fe1.jpeg,calxlea,Solved!,"Found a little plastic bag of fittings. Two plastic things with a thread as if you could screw them into something. One long metal rod with threaded head, one fuse-like glass cylinder with wire filament inside.

No idea what this came with, but probably something we got at Christmas. We just found it on our dining table. We moved house in the last year and have bought lots of random furniture and household items recently: a wooden bar; plug in “neon” bar sign (but I have fittings that came with that so don’t think these did); lots of miscellaneous picture frames; lamps; a radio; a Ring doorbell.

What could these be?"

Is the UV radiation from neon lights enough to cause skin damage ? It's hard to find serious information on the subject.

[REQUEST][STEAM] Neon White (50% off)($12.49),GiftofGames,1i9s5g3,2025-01-25 12:32:20,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1i9s5g3/requeststeam_neon_white_50_off1249/,Xengal4,REQUEST,"Hello everybody, I am here today requesting a game called Neon White. It is a fast action fps game that has many movement and parkour mechanics. I am a major fan of these types of games. I really enjoy playing ULTRAKILL because of those reasons. I am also a fan of Machine Girl, which the game just so happens to feature their music. 

The game has a speedrun like feel to it with you trying to get through a level quickly while also exterminating demons from heaven. It has a story that although fans are split on, I have a feeling I will enjoy. The game makes you strategize with what cards/weapons/moves you're gonna use and when you're gonna use them since the uses for each one is limited.

People that have played ULTRAKILL also recommend the game because of the similarities however the games are also very different. The movement is different with ULTRAKILL giving you mechanics and letting you figure out different combos with them. Neon White however, gives you a lot of other ways to move around with many moves being limited to what cards you're holding and what is around you.

The game also doesn't use up that many resources meaning that a laptop like mine can run it without issues. The game is also 50% off making this a great opportunity to get it. I would really appreciate if someone would be able to get it for me. Even if you don't get it for me I would like to say thank you for reading this and have a great day.
