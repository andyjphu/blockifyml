Raids Crashing after Grand Prix Update.,Crossout,1i9xb9g,2025-01-25 16:18:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crossout/comments/1i9xb9g/raids_crashing_after_grand_prix_update/,marcuszwarg,,"Hello everyone. I am here to show what me and several players who plays raids have been experiencing since the last update.

I have recorded several videos and posted unlisted on youtube, with detailed descriptions and timestamps.

[https://youtu.be/g\_ttBXWrQ9c](https://youtu.be/g_ttBXWrQ9c) \- 01 Double Cyclone (Recording since glitch)  
[https://youtu.be/h9SEvCdKsFI](https://youtu.be/h9SEvCdKsFI) \- 02 Mandrake (Glitch at 6:05)  
[https://youtu.be/gjDtO0\_CF\_k](https://youtu.be/gjDtO0_CF_k) \- 03 Swarm (Glitch at 4:20)  
[https://youtu.be/WbdzYMqjChk](https://youtu.be/WbdzYMqjChk) \- 04 Mammoth (Glitch at 5:40)  
[https://youtu.be/beVGA4\_3Q-w](https://youtu.be/beVGA4_3Q-w) \- 05 Arbiter (Glitch at 3:10)  
[https://youtu.be/05Isdc2tb-Y](https://youtu.be/05Isdc2tb-Y) \- 06 Triple Cyclone (Glitch at 4:00)

The gliches start after a few minutes into raids.  
Projectiles start acting funny, disappearing, getting stuck in the air, sticking to surfaces.  
Physics start getting weird. Enemy cars bounce and clip on the terrain, their pieces disappear.  
After a few more minutes after the glitches start, the game crashes to desktop.  
It seems that the time it does crash, and if depends on the lenght of the game and volume of projectiles.

This started happening after the Grand Prix update.  
The raids worked normally before the update.  
Many users in general chat also report the exact same issue.  
There is a Crossout Forum post with the same issue here:   
[https://forum.crossout.net/t/crash-in-raids-after-grand-prix-update/26566](https://forum.crossout.net/t/crash-in-raids-after-grand-prix-update/26566)  
Random people i played with also confirmed having those issues.  
Both my friends whom i play raids with in a daily basis also have this issue.  
Moreover, they crash at the exact same time as me. We live in separate states and use different ISPs.



This happens around 75% of the time. Every 4 matches, 3 will glitch and crash.  
Sometimes the glitch happens close to the end of the and it doesn't crash, but it's very random/lucky.The same thing happen whilst playing on any server: US, EU and RU.  
This happens on any raid type and any map.



PS.

Please do not be offended by the following:  
With all due respect, i build computers for a living, and i know what i am doing.  
My system is modern, powerful, properly maintained and updated.  
I do not need nor want tech tips/assistance with my computer/windows/game settings.  
I am reporting a glitch that MANY people are having. I am doing a service for the community.  
I already spent days troubleshooting my system with the best of my knowledge.  
I did a full uninstall, folder, settings of crossout then did a fresh install.  
I even built a virtual machine with only crossout installed, and the glitch happened there.  
I play several other games with no issues at all. BF2042, Diablo 4, Starcraft 2, Escape Tarkov, Division 2, to name a few.  
I wasted an afternoon of my time after several frustated gaming sessions with my friends because of this glitch, i feel very upset, and i will not appreciate jokes, trolling, sarcasm, provocation, etc. I even doxxxed myself because of how upset i was when i did the first video and uploaded an uncut version where personal information and desktop icons leaked. It was super frustrating.

Therefore, for those reasons, i might completely ignore such replies. Thank you."

That moving company will not accept responsibility so I'm trying to sue them. I have been trying to find an attorney to help me sue this company for almost a year now and I have found no one. I really need help with this before time runs out in March 2025. Below is the initial letter that I sent to that company. It should provide a better explanation of the situation. PLEASE HELP ME!!

>

To Whom it May Concern,

>I am reporting the total loss of the majority of my items stored at your Richmond, KY location.

>My then partner (name of person on the contract) hired your moving company to relocate us from Lexington, KY to Louisville, KY in July, 2023. The house we had planned to move into in Louisville, KY fell through. Your company then said that they would store our stuff in your warehouse storage until we had a place to move it to.

>A couple of months passed with no progress. Around September/October 2023, I went ahead and contacted your company to check the status of everything. This is when I found out that you were still storing our items and my now ex had never paid you anything for your services. I took it upon myself to step in and help. *\*Note: I did not have to do this. I had no legal obligation in any of this since the original contract was not in my name.*

>I began working with your Richmond manager. We struck an agreement that (name of person on the contract) would sign a notarized release of property to me and then I would pay your company $3000 cash to obtain all of our items.

>On March 4th, 2024, I arrived at your Richmond location with a U-Haul and a moving crew that I had hired to move all of our items to my new home located in Dayton, OH.

>Upon payment of cash and receipt of the completed contract, my movers & I began to unload from your ""storage"" into our trucks. *\*Note: we were originally told that our items would be stored in a secure warehouse storage area. They were not.* Instead, all of our items were stored within 2 broken-down moving truck trailers that belonged to your company. These trailers were parked at the back of your business in the same area that you dump trash and other unwanted items.

>As my movers started to unpack, water and mold was discovered right away. We began taking pictures for documentation. I also showed the situation and items to your London store manager that had been appointed to take over this case. He then informed me of your policy and procedure for reporting damages.

>I took 150 photos and a couple of videos that day as the truck was being unloaded. Standing and dripping water was discovered among my wet and moldy items. The result being everything had been destroyed. Even the moving truck trailer itself was wet and moldy the entire length of it.

>Overall, I willingly stepped into this situation to help. Delays were the fault of both myself and your company. However, we were never fully informed of how our items were being stored. While our stuff was with your company it was your responsibility to make sure it was all kept in the same condition it was when it was originally moved and this obviously  did not happen.

>We lost everything! We lost all of our furniture (new, used and antique), our appliances, our stored food items, our clothes, our linens, our decor, etc. Along with our lifetimes full of cherished memories that can never be replaced.

>So, moving forward, I have decided to file a lawsuit against your company. I am expecting to be reimbursed for all of our damaged items, pain, suffering, and hardship for all the anguish this situation has caused and cost. I will have my attorney contact you once our case is established.

I've attached pictures of just a few of my items that ended up moldy and wet. All of our stuff was in really good condition when it was originally picked up by these movers in July of 2023. Some of the furniture was even close to brand new.

**Again, any advise of how I can sue this moving company will be welcomed!!**"

**Synopsis:** ""Tul's"" first field visit at her new workplace was not smooth. To make matters worse, she had to work alongside ""Cheran"", the forensic pathologist in charge of the case. They were put into the same investigative team, both having differing personalities and attitudes which led to some tension. Not to mention the social pressures they had to face when all the cases were in the public eye and of a corrupt system that favours influential groups. However, as time goes by, the two of them become more trusting of each other.

The story becomes more complicated when one day, a murder occurs that is similar to one a serial killer committed 18 years ago. Was this the work of the ""Raindrop Killer""? Or was it a copycat?

**Episode Title and Summary:** Come In Out Of The Rain.

The truth is revealed about the ""Raindrop Killer."" Both Tul and Ran find themselves in a difficult situation as their professional duties intertwine with their personal relationship. Together, they delve into past events to uncover all the mysteries.

I worked at PTSB. Help me expose PTSBs unethical and illegal practices.,u_Chance_Zucchini5048,1i9wwrf,2025-01-25 16:00:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Chance_Zucchini5048/comments/1i9wwrf/i_worked_at_ptsb_help_me_expose_ptsbs_unethical/,Chance_Zucchini5048,,"I am exposing PTSB, its horrific working conditions and the scams they play on customers. If you’re up for helping me then you can skip to the end. If you want to know my story, read on…

First of all. As an ex-customer and staff member of PTSB, I can promise you all, that in a few years’ time, we will all be using FinTech banks like Revolut. The age of banks is already dead so, I have no problem whatsoever, exposing and hopefully destroying the reputation of this pointless worthless bank.

I was a customer of PTSB for 18years and sadly, I worked for them for a brief period of time.

Let me tell you my experience and, appeal to both staff and customers, to help me take down this absolute disgrace of a bank.

I was hired as a ''Customer Service Champion'' (stupid name for a banking advisor) in a Dublin branch. I had already worked in a couple of banks in a similar role so this was nothing new to me.

I found out, I was replacing a young girl who was traumatised by a customer. She was a cashier who caught the attention of an extremely sick individual who came to the bank every day to perv on her. He would arrive at the desk with gifts for her like perfume and jewellery. He would wait outside the bank for her and eventually, would take the same bus as her and follow her home.

She complained to the territory manager on a number of occasions, but nothing was done about it. No protections were put in place for her and her safety was completely ignored. Eventually, her parents complained to the manager who, decided it would be best that she be transferred elsewhere, like she was the problem.

That is exactly how management treat their staff that they are responsible for. Like they are disposable objects. Not worthy of any respect or empathy.

The man in question continued to visit the bank. We all ignored him, but it never stopped him following the female staff into offices and stationary cupboards. However, no one else complained because they knew it could affect their careers.

Staff do not receive any training whatsoever. Nothing. There is the usual mandatory training that is regulatory but has no impact on how to carry out your job dealing with customer queries. As regards to using the actual Uniscreens or SMART systems, there is no training. No training on how to use the cash desk. Nothing.

You have to hope that the other members of staff will show you, but it is completely dependent on whether or not they want to which, in my case, they weren’t.

Although the branch staff may appear to be operating as a team, they are not. Each member of staff has their own assigned job roles, customer cases and is in a hurry to get out for lunch at their allotted time and also, get home at a reasonable hour. They don’t have the time to aid a new staff member nor, in my case, were they willing. New staff are not given access to most systems and are not qualified to make any sales so, without help from other staff, new members are cannon fodder for angry customers and scape goats when something goes wrong.

By the way, the bank closes at 5 however, staff rarely get out before 7 in most cases. All unpaid overtime.

PTSB, as an institution, could not care less about the customers they are supposed to serve. Let me repeat that for any customer reading this. You are not valued in any shape or form. PTSB and, as a result, PTSB staff do not want you in the branch at all. You are considered a complete and utter nuisance. Staff literally gasp when they see you approach or watch you all queue outside or join the queue for the cash desk.

PTSB staff are only there for one purpose and one purpose only. To sell you insurance. You come to the bank for anything else, no one cares. If you are interested in home and contents insurance, you are listened to. They also push you to sign away your life savings to Irish life. The best scam ever, was closing down customers current accounts and making them sign up for Explore accounts. The script we gave customers was that it is better for your credit rating to have an explore account. Its only €6 per month and you make 10 cent cash back on purchases. After everyone signed up to the idea, PTSB increased the fee to €8 and reduced the cash back to 5 cent, capping it at €5. A simple yet effective scam.

PTSB customers are being played for fools. They offer you loans and mortgages at low rates only to sell them all to Pepper Finance who double any rates you signed up for. That’s why they bought Ulster Bank. To take its loan book and screw over all its customers. Has that happened to you? If so, you were 100% scammed.

Remember, I am ex staff, so I had all of this information explained to me.

PTSB have removed most of their cash desks and reduced the opening hours of the ones that remain, all to dissuade customers from coming to branch. There are a lot of overheads keeping branches open, especially the extra 25 acquired Ulster banks. They instead have put in place flimsy self-service machines and online banking portals. Let me tell you, these are the most disgustingly vile dirty machines that no one should touch believe me. They are forever breaking down and no one in the branch can fix them. An engineer visit has to be arranged which can take days. Again, to dissuade customers from coming to the branches. Instead, customers are directed to the app. The online banking and app are the most bare basic, useless outdated services that can do nothing but tell you your balance. That’s it. The other port of call is the telephone banking service which all of you know, is just to keep you on hold for an hour then cut you off.

As a result, customers come to the branch already enraged. They have to take time off work to come to the branch to be told they can’t withdraw their own money because they didn’t give enough notice, or they don’t have the right ID or the timer hasn’t been set. No, it’s because PTSB doesn’t have the cash to hand out. This is actually funny to me because when I was there, the manager stole €5000 and it was written off??! It’s a sinking ship of a bank that has lost a lot of its investors already.

Because the branch staff are not trained to handle any queries apart from setting up the app, customers become aggressive towards the staff like everything is their fault. I have witnessed customers screaming in staffs faces, corner them in offices, throw things at them. I’ve personally been grabbed, slapped, hands around my neck.

One female cashier had been with the bank 2 years. She took the main brunt of anger from customers. The mortgage advisor told me its because the customers are racist. Her and another white cashier with 6 months service were up for contract renewal. Guess which one kept their job… Classic racist PTSB. And also, PTSBs pride month celebration. It’s a marketing campaign. The managers incentivise staff to go to the parade and fly the PTSB banner for advertisement. They give those staff a day off. If they cared at all about PRIDE, they would go themselves, for free!

I have never seen a customer punished for aggressive behaviour. The managers always excused this behaviour and commended staff for not reacting to it. Managers don’t care about anyone but themselves. They are couped up in the offices all day, often hung over, dreaming about the next PTSB award ceremony where they can lick up to higher management and pat each other on the back for achieving absolutely nothing. PTSB is nothing more than a club for managers.

I should mention, customers who do come to branch to make a complaint are left waiting for as long as possible (to annoy you) then, after you finally utter that magical incantation “I want to speak to a manger” the manager arrives, pretends to listen to you, sends you on your merry way then, we all laugh at you in the lunchroom. No customer has ever made a complaint, especially in branch, that was ever recorded or handled or taken seriously.

Staff are hired on a 6-month probation basis which rarely gets renewed. Any staff over the last few years who lasted longer than 6 months are either staff they couldn’t sack during the covid pandemic or staff they absorbed from Ulster Bank that are on separate contracts. There are staff that are recruited through third party agencies that are forever held on a probationary basis that can be kept indefinitely or sacked at a moment’s notice. In six months, I saw 2 people sacked, 2 found jobs in different banks, 1 deserted and 3 transferred to another branch. The customers then have to suffer a lack of staff and services but who cares about them. Right PTSB?

I handed in my notice after 3 months. Couldn’t handle the toxic atmosphere, the aggression from customers and for being part of an organisation that scams the public. My manger convinced me to stay, and he would transfer me to a better department. I trusted him. I kept my mouth shut and head down. I made it to the 6-month mark. I was called into the office for what I believed was to be told I was being made permanent and being transferred somewhere else. Nope. I was sacked. No actual reason given but I was on probation so, all’s fair.

Turns out a new branch lead joined 2 months previous. Some alcoholic who used to be in airport security. She spent most Mondays in the office with her headphones on pretending to be on a call while nursing a hangover. Well, only on the Mondays that she came to work. Anyway, she told the manager on her first week she didn’t like me and wanted me sacked. Of course, no one mentioned this to me, so I didn’t even have a chance to find another job. Just told, your out. Got a handshake and that was that.

O, I was also told that I had to make a goodbye speech to everyone, thanking them for a wonderful experience or, I wouldn’t get a reference for my next job. Its all part of the plan to protect them from disgruntled ex-employees complaining about them.

I contacted the Financial services union, but they can’t do anything because legislation has left them powerless.

I filed a discrimination case, but PTSB hire an investigator from a company called Resolve Ireland, who interviews complainants, finds out what evidence they have against the bank then gets rid of it before the case goes to court. Clever really.

Anyway. I hate this bank. I see hundreds of reviews online from staff and customers who hate this bank as much as me. So,

I am gathering evidence from customers who have been mistreated. Any stories you have are totally welcome. Any evidence you have is even better.

I am already demanding from the retail officer, that all maintenance fees are reimbursed for the payment’s disruptions over Christmas, but I need your back up.

Staff. Please record any interactions you have with your manager. These people are not your friends no matter what they say. Their job is to keep you in line and dispose of you when it suits them. 500 members of staff are planned to be sacked this year. Do you really think your managers are going to choose to leave or, will they sack you instead? The best defence is to record everything your manager tells you. You should not be in the office alone with your manager without representation. Everything you tell them is compiled and kept on record to be used against you in the future. Compile your own evidence!

Also, email them everything that was said in the office and email me a copy. That way they can’t deny in the future what ever lies and false promises they made you.

This will give you a solid basis to prevent unfair dismissal and I will back you up every step of the way.

I will compile all of this evidence and use it to ensure staff are treated fairly, given safe working conditions, paid for every second they spend in the bank after 5 o clock, are given time off after every traumatic encounter with aggressive customers and hold managers responsible for unfair dismissal and discrimination.

I was already at the end of paying my old one off so decided to go ahead, pay the last month off and go ahead an upgrade my phone.

Started setting my new phone up and the eSIM transfer did not work at all. Tried to online chat with someone about this, they didn’t help and just shoved some stupid protection plan down my throat, along with sending a verification email to me in the completely wrong name.

Went to the store to get help. Associate said there was nothing he could do, and to call customer service. A little hard to call when the eSIM isn’t working and I can’t even get cellular service, don’t ya think bud?

Came back home and tried to chat online with customer service again. There only suggestion was opening a new line to complete the transfer. WTF I DONT NEED A SECOND LINE MORONS.

Finally, used someone else’s phone and was on the phone for over 2 hours just to get my phone fully activated. Went through multiple departments to finally get to someone who actually had the authority to go through the verification process to get this done.

All in all, probably 4+ hours spent trying to get a new phone activated. Why does Verizon make this so hard? Highly considering just paying my early termination fee and switching to Visible, which would save me significant money this year even with paying the early term fee."

"Need Help - CPA Didn't File Forms 8621 and 8938 with My 1040 Last Year, Confused",tax,1i9wnxu,2025-01-25 15:49:28,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1i9wnxu/need_help_cpa_didnt_file_forms_8621_and_8938_with/,Icy_Albatross7659,,"I recently discovered that my cross-border CPA failed to include Form 8621 (for PFICs) and Form 8938  in my 2023 US tax return (Form 1040 + NY state tax return). I'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this and would love your advice.

# Background

* I'm a Canadian citizen living in the US, and I became a US tax resident in 2023.
* I have a Canadian investment account that peaked at \~$57k USD in 2023, with \~$38.3k USD in PFICs (Canadian ETFs VFV and VEQT) at year-end.
* In 2023, the PFICs generated \~528 USD in income/dividends and there are \~$5.1k USD in unrealized capital gains since inception as of EOY 2023. The unrealized capital gains have continued to grow to \~17k USD.
* My total foreign assets exceeded the $50k threshold for Form 8938, but I was only aware of the FBAR requirement, which I filed.

# Tax Filing

* I provided a cross-border CPA with T3 tax slips and Canadian Trust info for the dividends I earned from the PFICs. I previously had them file my 2022 tax returns for Canada and the US.
* They reported the income/dividends as income on my 1040 but didn't file Forms 8621 or 8938. They didn't report any of the unrealized gains from the PFICs (VFV + VEQT). They also filed a Form 1116 for Foreign Tax Credit.
* The CPA firm never mentioned PFICs, Form 8621, or Form 8938, even though they prepared my Canadian and US taxes for 2022 and mentioned I would become a US tax resident in 2023.
* I filed an FBAR for all my foreign accounts in 2023 after they mentioned it would be needed.
* I was invoiced \~1k USD for “preparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for one state and employment income only"" and paid extra for ""preparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for investment income.”

# Questions

1. **How Do I Fix This?**
   * Should I file a 1040-X for my 2023 and include a letter explaining my situation? My CPA did reported the PFIC income/dividends as income earned through interest + dividends and filed the FBAR, so I’m hoping the IRS won't penalize me for non-compliance. I might also need to fix the NY state return for the PFICs but haven't done enough research.
2. **CPA's Responsibility**:
   * Should I ask my CPA why they didn’t file Forms 8621 and 8938? When I asked near end of December, they just said they ""reported accordingly per info received and request"".
   * Are they potentially liable if I receive penalties? Should I request a partial refund for improper services?
3. **Filing Advice**:
   * Does anyone know good tax software to help me amend my return with Forms 8621 and 8938?
   * For 2024, if I sell one of my Canadian ETFs (PFICs), do I only report the sale as capital gains on Form 8621?
4. **PFIC Elections**:
   * When I amend my 2023 return, should I elect QEF or no election since Vanguard provides the info for PFIC calculations such as linked below (https://www.vanguard.ca/content/dam/intl/americas/canada/en/documents/VFV\_9563\_PFIC\_C032024.pdf)? From doing some reading, I saw it might be hard for the IRS to accept a retroactive election, so I might just do no election for 2023, and look into doing an election in 2024. I don't want to be taxed like crazy but thinking of the pros and cons.
5. **Future Plans**:
   * To simplify my tax returns, I’m planning to sell all my PFICs within the next few weeks. I might also transfer my cash and securities to US accounts to avoid future cross-border complexities. Does this make sense?

This has been a really stressful lesson in cross-border tax compliance. I just want to get back on track with the IRS and avoid penalties. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks for your help!"

Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners,antiwork,1i9wg7b,2025-01-25 15:40:01,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1i9wg7b/lesbians_and_gays_support_the_miners/,thisislieven,,">""And why should gay people like me support the miners?""

""Because miners dig for coal, which produces power, which allows gay people like you to dance to Bananarama till 3 o'clock in the morning.""

*Pride (2014)*

In 1984/85 the United Kingdom faced the Miner's Strike. This year-long strike was led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the governmental National Coal Board (NCB). It is considered to be one of the biggest and most persistent strikes anywhere in the world any time in history,

Opposition to the strike came primarily from the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher and, unfortunately, the strike led to a bitter loss for the NUM and its miners.

Despite the defeat, the miner's strike gives us many lessons for the present day and the current fight.   
Here's one which feels especially current and I'd like to highlight:

About three months into the strike, activist Mark Ashton established Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM) with a number of his gay friends (and one lesbian). 

LGSM chose to support the miners, particularly a community in rural Wales, because of their socialist background and they would raise significant amounts of money - all the while proud and loud in their gay and lesbian identity. At no point did they ask the miners for their support. LGSM simply recognised the shared struggle was about class above anything else and understood the strength of solidarity.

These days, LGSM is seen as a turning point in the movement towards LGBTQ+ equality in the UK.  
The NUM voted as a block in the national Labour meeting of 1985, helping to enshrine the political party's support for LGBTQ+ rights, and were among the most outspoken allies against [section 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28).

Struck down, the miners still recognised the solidarity and friendship they were given and found a way to return the favour.

In 2014, the movie [Pride](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3169706/) was released to critical acclaim. It documents the story of LGSM and the miners in a lighthearted way (it stars Imelda Staunton and Andrew Scott, among others - it is worth a watch, if only for the glorious recreation of the 80's). 

Because of the movie's release, the surviving members of LGSM were asked to lead the 2015 Pride in London Parade. After trade unions and other affiliated organisations were told they could not join them, LGSM withdrew. Instead they chose to march in the back, together.

Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants is an activist group named in recognition of LGSM.  
The solidarity continues, and continues to inspire.

The story is of course much bigger. To learn more:

*I recognise coal mining is not a popular cause to support these days, but note that the strike occurred in the 80's, when attitudes and public knowledge weren't what they are today. More importantly, this is not about the mines - it never was. It is about the workers, the people just trying to make a living often in areas with few options, and the solidarity they were shown by the unlikeliest of groups who understood this was a fight between the classes above anything else.*

"The substance of selflessness, and the woes of taking oaths.",Christianity,1i9wflf,2025-01-25 15:39:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i9wflf/the_substance_of_selflessness_and_the_woes_of/,codrus92,,"__Oaths__

33 “Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.’ 34 But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 And do not take an oath by your head, for you can not make one hair white or black. 37 Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.""

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205&version=ESV

We can't even change a speck of our hair from black to white (our hair turning from a dark shade, to white ultimately); anything more than 'yes' or 'no' we've ever said regarding the influence of the idea of a Heaven—God or Afterlife, and the influence of an Earth—humans, our peers, our contemporaries and the wieght their influence has upon us (hence racism), only comes from a worry, a need, desire, or fear for ourselves: a _selfishness_; it would only be ""blind men leading other blind men.""  This would of course include questions like: ""what does this God(s) or Afterlife _truly_ consist of, and what does it mean for _me_, and/or my contemporaries?""  Or: ""what is _absolutely_ true?""  The peace we find in taking oaths to the man made answers we find to these questions only comes from evil: a worry, need, fear or desire for ourselves—a selfishness.  I believe in an unimaginable God(s) or creator(s) of some kind, just for context, but I agree with Jesus that anything more then this would only come from selfishness in some way.  I rest my head on the precepts of Tolstoy's _completely objective_ interpretation of The Sermon On The Mount, and it alone in becoming a kind of constitution for our conscience so to speak—for our hearts, as a species.

Oath-taking, so to speak, only holds the potential to divide us (40k different ways, apparently, yes there's roughly that many sects) and even lead us into iniquity to any degree; iniquity defined by the precept captioned __The Golden Rule__ and even described as ""the Law and the Prophets"" that were meant to be fulfilled: “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.""  - Matt 7:12

The third maxim inscribed at the Temple of Apollo, where the Oracle of Delphi resided in Ancient Greece: ""Give a pledge and trouble is at hand.""  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphic_maxims

Oath-taking—considering things as infallibly or as unquestionably true; absolutely true—leads us into things like racism, slander, hate between one portion of people and another, war between nations, not being united in selflessness—divided 40k different ways in its regard, not to mention all the other man made things being held as unquestionably true; potentially defiling ones mind into thinking just about anything, like Paul, convinced persecuting early followers of Jesus' teaching was right, true and just beyond any shadow of a doubt—due to the oaths he's taken, both either figuratively and literally to either himself, or anything else; throwing the supposed Messiah (not to mention anyone at all in the first place) up on a cross; to be convinced what the Pharisees have to say is as true as what the Pastors or Fathers of today have to say, especially regarding the influences of the idea of a Heaven—a God and an Afterlife.

We can't even change a speck of our hair from black to white, so why even bother only setting the stage for the evil of either today or tomorrow to take advantage of those influences?  And only stigmatize our capacity for selflessness not only individually, but especially collectively as a species by claiming our or anyones more than 'yes' or 'no' regarding these influences is _absolutely_ true beyond any doubt; when the question is an irrelevance to begin with, only the _substance_ of our more than 'yes' or 'no' really matters, ultimately, which can be sumed up simply as: selflessness, to even and especially, the most extreme degrees.  Why bother taking an oath in any way regarding the influences stated?  Considering the extent we can't even guarantee anything in life; what is it that causes this principle to fall short when considering things like what exactly a God(s) or creator(s) of some kind consists of or what happens exactly when we die?  We can't even change a speck of our hair from black to white, so why bother taking oaths to things completely beyond our comprehension or ability?  Like toiling over trying to guarantee exactly what our future will be or what exactly am Afterlife, God(s) or creator(s) of some kind consists of?  Wouldn't the _substance_ then therefore of something we can _absolutely_ comprehend: love (selflessness), and our ability to reason and logic that serves as its basis, be significantly more important then anymore then our yes's and no's regarding the influences of a Heaven (God and an Afterlife) and an Earth (our contemporaries) that have only proven to divide us more then unify?  To hate and kill each other over even.

It's the opposite of oath-taking, and a close mind that's lead to Christianity at all in the first place; how ironic the extent it presently advocates the very kind of oaths and close-mindedness that would've lead to it never being considered to begin with, and Jesus himself not being able to see past the fear for himself that's been inculcated into him by the dogma of his day, to see past what was presently being held as infallible, to find the truth that's been smothered by it, becoming a yet another Pharisee himself otherwise.  Jesus, with an open mind, and seeing the dogma of the day as _questionably_ true, opposed to _unquestionably_ true—like how most sects of Christianity consider their interpretations presently—like the Pharisees would and even teach others to do the same, was able to find the truth that wasn't The Nicene Creed (in my opinion, obviously), but our capacity for love as a species, and the _knowledge_ of the relevance and potential of returning any degree of it, for evil done; to potentially reach a day where violence, at the very least, is considered a laughable part of our past like the idea of a King is to us now, or not being able to fly around in airplanes; to potentially even cure the world of at _least_ the majority of hate, evil, and _division_ within it, but especially to lead us away from this life of hell we ultimately dig for ourselves when we—out of instinct and taking oaths—build our house (our life) on the sand, like most people, and to instead take the path that's more difficult, and less attractive to most people: a life of selflessness, and build our house (our life) up on the rock, becoming a son or daughter of ""_our_ Father"" ourselves; a ""Son of Man,"" people like Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Socrates, Jesus, Gandhi.  Men that gave up their personal welfare and a life of themselves to toil and even suffer over teaching and exemplifying—influencing men to be good for any reason (peacemaking), leading them out of iniquity and this hell on Earth we're inherently drawn to, being mammals and abscent this knowledge.  Their names given new life after death, via our unique ability to transfer knowledge, living on for eternity or at least for a time, inspiring men out of a life of iniquity, ultimately becoming a prisoner to their mind, or to men otherwise.

Additionally, their profile history shows they have left similar negative reviews under similar pretenses for other businesses that have never interacted with them.

I have responded to the review politely and professionally, flagged it multiple times, and even escalated the issue with Google, but they still refuse to take it down. This is currently the only review on my Google Business Profile (GBP). This situation is putting me at a significant disadvantage as I’m still in the process of building my client base.

At this point, if the fake review doesn’t get removed—which it likely won’t—I’m considering creating a new business listing, and marking this one as permanently closed.

I'm doing my Masters in Accounting at a top university here, but I'm unhappy and lost. I guess accounting is not my thing. I basically had to study it for my undergrad to avoid the mandatory army service, and now, years later, I'm still miserable and bored.

I tried working in the field, but hated every second of it. Like, why would I spend my life just adding numbers and following orders? So I quit all the jobs. My dream is to find something I'm actually passionate about – something I can keep learning and researching, maybe even make a real difference. I want to study at a top university in Europe (even though I don't have that much money) and hopefully make a name for myself.

I'm thinking about going back to an old passion: cellular and molecular biology, maybe even specialize in genetics. But there aren't many jobs in that field here, so I'd probably have to move abroad. What do you think? Should I completely change my path, even if it means two mandatory years in the army? What are the good reasons to stay on this track?

***Tbh, I am not really sure that after all these years, I still like genetics or not.***

I had another option in mind, and that was professional (freelance) video editing, and since I've heard that this might also be affected by Ai, i'm just sad. I find few options and all of them just slip away"

WIBTA If I tell my long distance friend of many years to stop contacting me?,AITA_Relationships,1i9vvmc,2025-01-25 15:14:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1i9vvmc/wibta_if_i_tell_my_long_distance_friend_of_many/,Savings_Orchid_7440,,"
I will be using a fake name for my friend for anonymity ( Anna ), and sorry for any mistakes in advance. English is not my first language.

I have a friend, Anna, of many years that has been living abroad for some time already, but we kept in touch through the Internet. I considered them my closest friend for a very long time, but they changed recently.

Since a few months Anna started to barely reply, usually in ""haha"" and ""lol"" kind of responses only. They suddenly claim to be ""really busy 24/7"", I eventually found out that they're constantly playing games, watching something on streaming services, texting on servers and whatnot. I confronted Anna about it and asked why I didn't get a reply from them in weeks. They claimed that ""they didn't have any time to pick up their phone because they're so busy with work and I should just understand.""

Now I'm not in the place to tell anyone If they're busy or not or how should they relax. My issue with this situation is that they didn't send me a SINGLE message in weeks, and theyre lying to me instead of simply saying how it is. Not a single ""Hey I'm busy"" or ""hi, I won't be talking for a while."" So I told Anna that I know they weren't busy 24/7, which made them angry like never before.

Suddenly Anna started flooding me with long messages about my immaturity, how I'm a hypocrite and should just understand that they doesn't have time for me and that it's not their fault. Firstly I never said its their fault, secondly I never insulted them when confronting them.

So I stopped replying, not wanting to talk with Anna now that I'm being showered with insults. This has never happened before, but i never pointed anything out to them either before. Anna started to text EVERY WEEK no matter if I reply or not about how I'm immature, I should just ""get over it because I'm the one being mad over nothing"". When I try to reason with Anna and tell them to be honest with me, they tell me that I'm being rude and ask ""what's wrong with me"", then they tell me that ""I'm their best friend"" and then back to insulting. It's conflicting.

My intention isn't to hurt their feelings, but at the same time I just want them to stop. WIBTA If I just straight up told Anna to stop messaging me? I find blocking to be childish, so I don't want to do it unless necessary, but everytime they text I feel terrible. I don't want them to contact me anymore.

TL:DR : long distance friend stopped replying to me. Found their status doing something else ( games ) while they claimed theyre not. I pointed it out. They're pissed, yet suddenly keep trying to text me over and over calling me immature and also keep the friendship going. I want to tell them to stop contacting me."

Directors at the Box Office: ?,boxoffice,1i9vsbc,2025-01-25 15:10:27,10,0.92,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1i9vsbc/directors_at_the_box_office/,SanderSo47,✍️ Original Analysis,"https://preview.redd.it/uyxky3c267fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb389b8e081732cb21279291a0988b0b1ac4f322

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. 

For the first time, the director’s name was kept hidden. The purpose of the mystery? That’s up to you to decipher. But it’s a timely choice.

And so it is time to talk about…

…

…

Oliver Stone.

As a child, he often spent parts of his summer vacations with his maternal grandparents in France, both in Paris and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre in Seine-et-Marne. Stone was admitted to Yale University, but left in June 1965 at age 18 to teach high school students English for six months in Saigon at the Free Pacific Institute in South Vietnam. In April 1967, Stone enlisted in the United States Army and requested combat duty in Vietnam. From September 27, 1967, to February 23, 1968, he served in Vietnam with 2nd Platoon, B Company, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was wounded twice, for which he earned the Purple Heart. Following the war, Stone suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Stone graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film in 1971, where his teachers included director and fellow NYU alumnus Martin Scorsese. While working as a taxi driver, he worked as a screenwriter before finally being allowed to direct.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**Seizure (1974)**

His directorial debut. It stars Jonathan Frid, Martine Beswick, Hervé Villechaize, and Henry Judd Baker. In the film, horror writer Edmund Blackstone sees his recurring nightmare come to chilling life one weekend as one by one, his friends and family are killed by three villains: the Queen of Evil, a dwarf named Spider, and a giant scar-faced strongman called Jackal.
It didn’t get a proper theatrical release. Star Mary Woronov would later claim that one of the film's producers was gangster Michael Thevis, who partially bankrolled the film in an attempt to launder money, as he was under investigation by the FBI.

#**The Hand (1981)**

His second film. Based on the novel *The Lizard's Tail* by Marc Brandel, it stars Michael Caine and Andrea Marcovicci. It follows Jon Lansdale, a comic book artist who loses his hand, which in turn takes on a murderous life of its own.

The film received mixed reviews and was a box office failure. But Stone still had some clout in the industry thanks to his screenwriting credits, so he would continue having more chances.

- **Budget:** $6,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,447,576. ($8.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,447,576.

#**Salvador (1986)**

His third film. It stars James Woods, Jim Belushi, Michael Murphy, Elpidia Carrillo, John Savage and Cynthia Gibb. The film tells the story of an American journalist covering the Salvadoran Civil War who becomes entangled with both the FMLN and the right-wing military dictatorship while trying to rescue his girlfriend and her children.

Oliver Stone had originally intended to film this directly within El Salvador itself. Having been disappointed with the lack of commercial success for his previous two films, and with a newborn son to raise, Stone was contemplating ideas when a chance meeting with Richard Boyle, whom he considered an eccentric kindred spirit, inspired him to collaborate with Boyle and create *Salvador*. Stone himself was a Vietnam War veteran and frustrated with the war itself, thus allowing him to channel his political disdain for war into the story and characters of the film.

While it wasn’t a box office success, it received critical acclaim. Woods and Stone received Oscar nominations for the film, allowing him to continue his career.

- **Budget:** $4,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,500,000. ($4.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,500,000.

#**Platoon (1986)**

*”The first casualty of war is innocence.”*

His fourth film. It stars Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, Forest Whitaker, and Johnny Depp. The film, based on Stone's experience from the war, follows a new U.S. Army volunteer serving in Vietnam while his Platoon Sergeant and his Squad Leader argue over the morality in the platoon and of the war itself.

Development began as early as 1968, months after Stone had completed his own tour of duty fighting in Vietnam. Stone first wrote a screenplay called *Break*, a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences with his parents and his time in the Vietnam War. Stone's active duty service resulted in a ""big change"" in how he viewed life and the war. Although *Break* was never produced, he later used it as the basis for *Platoon*. The script was set to music from The Doors; Stone sent the script to Jim Morrison in the hope he would play the lead (Morrison had the script with him when he died in Paris).

After establishing his career as a screenwriter, Stone redeveloped *Break* as a new concept, while still keeping some elements. Despite some success as screenwriter, most studios were still reluctant to finance *Platoon*, because it was about the unpopular Vietnam War. The Department of Defense refused to support the production of the film due to its depiction of American war crimes, claiming the script was ""rife with unrealistic and highly unfavorable depictions of the American soldier.” Dino De Laurentiis helped Stone in securing Hemdale, but they first wanted him to direct *Salvador*.

When the film was greenlit, Stone offered the lead role to James Woods. While he liked Stone, Woods didn’t want to experience so many months in the jungle with him. Many actors were interested in joining, like Denzel Washington hoping to play Elias. When Willem Dafoe was cast, he suggested casting Charlie Sheen as Taylor. Jon Cryer, who would later co-star with Sheen in *Two and a Half Men*, auditioned for the role of Bunny, losing to Kevin Dillon. Many Vietnamese refugees living in the Philippines at the time were recruited to act in different Vietnamese roles in the film.

The production made a deal with the Philippine military for the use of military equipment. As a result of the Department of Defense refusing to supply historically-accurate equipment and uniforms, the film instead used equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Upon arrival in the Philippines, the cast was sent on an intensive training course, during which they had to dig foxholes and were subjected to forced marches and nighttime ""ambushes,"" which used special-effects explosions. Led by Vietnam War veteran Dale Dye, training put the principal actors — including Sheen, Dafoe, Depp and Whitaker — through an immersive 30-day military-style training regimen. They limited how much food and water they could drink and eat and when the actors slept, fired blanks to keep the tired actors awake.

After a strong run in limited release, the film hit wide release on its seventh weekend, managing to top the box office. It held incredibly well, breaking so many records for Orion Pictures. It eventually closed with a fantastic $138 million domestically, becoming the third highest grossing film in North America for 1986. It received critical acclaim, lauded as one of the greatest war films ever made. The film received 8 Oscar nominations and won 4: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Stone was now a huge name in the industry and was ready for more.

- **Budget:** $6,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $138,530,565. ($396.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $138,530,565.

#**Wall Street (1987)**

*”Every dream has a price.”*

His fifth film. It stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Daryl Hannah, and Martin Sheen. The film tells the story of Bud Fox, a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko, a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider.

After the success of *Platoon*, Stone wanted film school friend Stanley Weiser to research and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in *Crime and Punishment*. Stone had been thinking about this kind of a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.

Stone considered Tom Cruise to play Fox, but he already committed to reunite with Charlie Sheen in the film. Sheen also convinced Stone to cast his father Martin as his character’s father. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. After Richard Gere passed on the role, Stone went with Michael Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Douglas was known for heroic roles and was looking for something dark and edgy.

The film was a huge success, earning $90 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim, becoming one of the most iconic films of the 80s. After overcoming obstacles, Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Stone was just unstoppable.

- **Budget:** $16,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $43,848,069. ($121 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $90,448,069.

#**Talk Radio (1988)**

*”The last neighborhood in America.”*

His sixth film. Based on the play by Eric Bogosian and Tad Savinar, it stars Bogosian, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Greene, and Leslie Hope. When his show is about to go national, Barry, a controversial radio personality, has to cope with family issues, hate mails and a call from a stranger threatening to plant a bomb.

Despite positive reviews, it was a box office failure.

- **Budget:** $4,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $3,468,572. ($9.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $3,468,572.

#**Born on the Fourth of July (1989)**

*”A true story of innocence lost and courage found.”*

His seventh film. Based on the 1976 autobiography of Ron Kovic, it stars Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley, and Willem Dafoe. The film depicts the life of Kovic over a 20-year period, detailing his childhood, his military service and paralysis during the Vietnam War, and his transition to anti-war activism. 

Al Pacino expressed interest in portraying Ron Kovic after watching his televised appearance at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and reading his autobiography. He also turned down starring roles in the Vietnam War-themed films *Coming Home* and *Apocalypse Now*, the former for which Kovic would act as a consultant. Kovic met with Pacino in New York, where they discussed adapting the book to film. In September 1976, Pacino's manager, producer Martin Bregman, contacted Kovic's agent and entered into negotiations for the film rights. Filming was scheduled to begin in June 1977 with Paramount acting as distributor, but the project fell apart. Bregman and Pacino were unhappy with the script, and the studio dropped the film.

When the project fell apart, Stone was hired to write a new screenplay. Stone promised Kovic that if his career took off, he would return to Kovic to revive the project. Kovic stated that after the release of *Platoon*, Stone called Kovic and told him he was ready to return working on the film.

Stone's agent Paula Wagner had shown *Platoon* to Tom Cruise, after he had expressed interest in working with Stone. The studio was concerned over the prospects of Cruise appearing as a dramatic film lead. Stone, in particular, had dismissed his previous film *Top Gun* as a ""fascist movie"", but expressed that he was drawn to Cruise's ""Golden Boy"" image, ""I saw this kid who has everything. And I wondered what would happen if tragedy strikes, if fortune denies him ... I thought it was an interesting proposition: What would happen to Tom Cruise if something goes wrong?"" Kovic was also wary of Cruise's casting, but relented when the actor visited him at his home in Massapequa, New York.

With a big name like Cruise, the film was a colossal success, earning $161 million worldwide, becoming Stone’s highest grossing film. It also received critical acclaim and earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Stone would end up winning Best Director, marking his third Oscar win. Unstoppable.

- **Budget:** $17,800,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,001,698. ($177.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $161,001,698.

#**The Doors (1991)**

*”There are things known and things unknown. And in between are…”*

His eighth film. It stars Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, Billy Idol, and Kathleen Quinlan. It is based on the history of American rock band the Doors and their influence on music and counterculture, mainly focusing on singer Jim Morrison.

For many years, there were attempts in making a Doors biopic, with directors like Quentin Tarantino, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin attached at one point. Stone was offered the position and he met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone. But after watching *Platoon*, they approved Stone, although keyboardist Ray Manzarek had his reservations.

When Stone began talking about the project in 1988, he had Val Kilmer in mind to play Morrison, after seeing him in *Willow*. Kilmer had the same kind of singing voice as Morrison and, to convince Stone that he was right for the role, spent several thousand dollars of his own money and made his own eight-minute audition video, singing and looking like Morrison at various stages of his life. To prepare for the role, Kilmer lost weight and spent six months rehearsing Doors songs every day; the actor learned 50 songs, 15 of which are actually performed in the film. When the Doors heard Kilmer singing they could not tell whether the voice was Kilmer's or Morrison's.

Despite the band’s popularity, the film flopped at the box office. It also received mixed reviews; Kilmer received high praise for his performance, but many criticized its historical inaccuracies and depiction of Morrison.

- **Budget:** $32,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $34,416,893. ($79.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $34,416,893.

#**JFK (1991)**

*”He's a District Attorney. He will risk his life, the lives of his family, everything he holds dear for the one thing he holds sacred... the truth.”*

His ninth film. Based on the book *On the Trail of the Assassins* by Jim Garrison, it stars Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Jay O. Sanders, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, and Martin Sheen. The film examines the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, who came to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a scapegoat.

Stone was introduced to Garrison’s book and immediately optioned the film rights. Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His pride and dignity impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that ""Garrison made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds.""

One of Stone’s primary goals was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was ""a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth."" Stone was hungry for more information and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.

The film marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing's rhythm carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his ""chaotic mind"" was ""totally alien to the film form.""

Since its announcement, the film drew controversy. Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of spreading untruths, including the claim that Kennedy was killed as part of a coup d'état to install Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson in his place. Stone split his time making the film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign that saw him ""omnipresent, from CBS Evening News, to Oprah.""

The film debuted with just $5 million, leading many to label it as a flop, although some blamed the 3-hour runtime as it limited screenings. But WB was confident that business would pick up, and they increased their marketing campaign. And it worked; it legged out to $70 million domestically. But the real story was in the rest of the world. Normally, a film focused on American politics would massively skew domestically, but *JFK* is not one of those. In fact, the overseas markets represented 65% of its worldwide gross. It earned a huge $205 million worldwide, becoming Stone’s highest grossing film. It was a phenomenon. 

Despite being accused of spreading conspiracy theories, the film received critical acclaim, particularly for its performances, directing, cinematography and editing. It earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning for Best Cinematography and Best Editing.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,405,498. ($162.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $205,405,498.

#**Heaven & Earth (1993)**

*”From Vietnam to America, one woman's journey from hope, to love, to discovery.”*

His 10th film. Based on the book *When Heaven and Earth Changed Places* by Le Ly Hayslip, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Haing S. Ngor, Joan Chen, and Hiep Thi Le. Tragedy forces Le Ly to leave her job and return to her previous province, where she meets Steve Butler, a gunnery sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. Things change when they fall in love.

The film was a critical and commercial dud.

- **Budget:** $33,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $5,864,949. ($12.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $5,864,949.

#**Natural Born Killers (1994)**

*”The media made them superstars.”*

His 11th film. It stars Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, and Tom Sizemore. The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.

Quentin Tarantino wrote a script, in which a married couple goes on a killing spree. He hoped to direct it, but instead chose to sell it for $10,000. WB eventually got it, and Stone became interested in the film. Stone re-wrote the script with David Veloz and Richard Rutowski,, keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory. The script was revised so drastically that Tarantino was credited for the story only. Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well.

Stone originally wanted it to be an action film, but incidents such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers case, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident, the Rodney King incident, and the Waco siege all took place. Stone came to feel that the media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases, and that the media had become an all-pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings. As such, he changed the tone of the film from one of purely action to a ""vicious, coldhearted farce"" on the media.

Stone cast Woody Harrelson partly because, ""frankly, he had that American, trashy look. There's something about Woody that evokes Kentucky or white trash."" At the time, Harrelson was primarily known for his comedic performances, namely his role on the sitcom *Cheers*, and Stone was compelled to cast him against type. Stone cast Lewis for a similar reason, noting that, despite her success as portraying a defiled teenage daughter in *Cape Fear*, he felt she could ""pull off white trash, too.” Stone cast comedy legend Rodney Dangerfield as Mallory’s rapist father, but Stone didn’t give him a script; he simply told Dangerfield he was going to play ""the father from Hell.” As such, Dangerfield wrote all the ""filthy stuff"" his character said. 

It was filmed and edited in a frenzied and psychedelic style and features both color and black and white cinematography, as well as animation, and other unusual color schemes and visual compositions. Editing of the film lasted approximately 11 months, with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts (most films have 600–700). The film also employs a wide range of camera angles, featuring Dutch tilts prominently throughout, with the camera rarely angling along a horizontal field of vision. Coca-Cola approved the use of the Polar Bear ads for its product in the movie without having a full idea of what the movie was about; when the Board of Directors saw the finished product, they were furious.

The film topped the box office in its opening weekend, closing with $50 million domestically and $110 million worldwide, becoming another success for Stone. But the film received divisive reactions from critics and audiences. Those who hated it criticized its editing, visual style, depravity, graphic violence and satire, while fans praised it for those exact same things.

Tarantino disowned the film, saying, ""I hated that fucking movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie."" He also claimed to have never watched the film from beginning to end. From almost the moment of its release, the film has been accused of encouraging and inspiring numerous murderers in North America, including the perpetrators of the 1997 Heath High School shooting and the Columbine High School massacre. Needless to say, it has appeared in lists for “most controversial films ever”.

- **Budget:** $34,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $50,282,766. ($106.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $110,282,766.

#**Nixon (1995)**

*”Triumphant in victory, bitter in defeat.”

His 12th film. It stars Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, Powers Boothe, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, E. G. Marshall, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Sorvino, Mary Steenburgen, J. T. Walsh, and James Woods. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, portrayed as a complex and in many respects admirable, albeit deeply flawed, person.

While it received positive reviews, it was one of the biggest flops of 1995.

- **Budget:** $44,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $13,681,765. ($28.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $13,681,765.

#**U Turn (1997)**

*”Sex. Murder. Betrayal. Everything that makes life worth living.”*

His 13th film. Based on the novel *Stray Dogs* by John Ridley, it stars Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight, Powers Boothe, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Nick Nolte. Bobby Cooper is a drifter who is on the run due to his debt to a violent gangster. When his car breaks down in a town in Arizona, things begin to go wrong.

It was a critical and commercial failure.

- **Budget:** $19,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,682,098. ($13 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $6,682,098.

#**Any Given Sunday (1999)**

*”Life is a contact sport.”*

His 14th film. Based on the 1984 novel by NFL defensive end Pat Toomay, it stars Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, James Woods, LL Cool J, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Matthew Modine, John C. McGinley, Charlton Heston, Bill Bellamy, Lela Rochon, Aaron Eckhart, Elizabeth Berkley, and NFL players Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor. Tony D'Amato coaches the Miami Sharks football team and struggles to help them succeed. Meanwhile, he also has a troubled relationship with the owner of the team.

Stone failed to get the National Football League's permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the Sharks play at the Miami Orange Bowl (which the NFL Miami Dolphins abandoned after the 1986 season) in the fictional Affiliated Football Franchises of America (AFFA), which is not to be confused with the real AFA; the AFFA exists alongside the NFL in this universe, as the Dolphins are mentioned in one scene.

It received mixed reviews, and fell short of breaking even.

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $75,530,832. ($142.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $100,230,832.

#**Alexander (2004)**

*”Fortune favors the bold.”*

His 15th film. Based on the book *Alexander the Great* by the University of Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, it stars Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, and Anthony Hopkins. It is based on the life of the ancient Macedonian general and king Alexander the Great.

While Stone has attracted mixed reviews before, he wasn’t prepared for the reception here. The film got obliterated by critics, who lambasted it as one of the worst films of the year. The audience reception was also horrible; it got a “D+” on CinemaScore, which was the worst grade given to a $100+ million film. The film massively flopped in North America, and while it saved some face in Europe, it went down as one of the biggest flops in history. Ouch.

- **Budget:** $155,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $34,297,191. ($56.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $167,298,192.

#**World Trade Center (2006)**

*”A true story of courage and survival.”*


His 16th film. It stars Nicolas Cage, Michael Peña, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Stephen Dorff, Jay Hernandez, and Michael Shannon. The film is based on the experience of a team of Port Authority Police Officers during the September 11 attacks, in which they were trapped inside the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center.

Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of having his film examine 9/11 conspiracy theories because Stone was known for examining various conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination in *JFK*. However, Stone has stated that the film does not explore the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11. He, the producers, and the real McLoughlin and Jimeno, have said the film is a simple dedication to the heroism and sadness of the day with little-to-no political themes.

After a few failures, this was a much needed success for Stone.

- **Budget:** $65,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,278,893. ($10.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $163,247,198.

#**W. (2008)**

*”A life misunderestimated.”*

His 17th film. It stars Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Banks, James Cromwell, Ellen Burstyn, Thandiwe Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Scott Glenn, and Richard Dreyfuss, and follows the life of President George W. Bush.

It received mixed reviews, and was another financial failure.

- **Budget:** $25,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $25,534,493. ($37.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $29,560,587.

#**Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010)**

*”Gordon never gives up.”*

His 18th film. The sequel to *Wall Street*, it stars Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The film takes place in New York City, 23 years after the original, and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. Its plot centers on a supposedly reformed Gordon Gekko, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie, with the help of her fiancé, Jacob Moore.

In 2007, development began, as Douglas was very interested in playing Gekko again, with Stone back as director. Stone was not interested in a sequel, but reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash. Stone said that the film will provide more of a social commentary and admitted that he had never expected high finance to ""serve again as a tableau for his storytelling"". He also added that its plot will showcase the unemployment rate at an all-time high and the ""our national debt ever climbing.""

Neither Charlie Sheen nor Daryl Hannah were expected to return, for unknown reasons. Nevertheless, Stone convinced Sheen to return for a brief appearance. Sheen was able to shoot his scene in one day and described being on set with Stone and Douglas as strange, with Stone adding that it was difficult for the actor. Sheen reportedly had trouble remembering his lines and required some prodding to remember his cue during the party scene in which Gekko encounters Fox.

The film earned $134 million worldwide, although it still fell short of breaking even. Reception was mixed, widely considered inferior to the original.

- **Budget:** $70,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $52,474,616. ($75.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $134,748,021.

#**Savages (2012)**

*”Young. Beautiful. Deadly.”*

His 19th film. Based on the novel by Don Winslow, it stars Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Benicio del Toro, Demián Bichir, Salma Hayek, Emile Hirsch and John Travolta. The film follows two marijuana growers, Chon, an ex-Navy SEAL, and Ben, who are best friends, as they confront the Mexican drug cartel that kidnapped their shared girlfriend.

It received mixed reviews, and once again failed to break even.

- **Budget:** $45,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $47,382,068. ($64.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $82,966,152.

#**Snowden (2016)**

*”The only safe place is on the run.”*

His 20th film. Based on the books *The Snowden Files* by Luke Harding and *Time of the Octopus* by Anatoly Kucherena, it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, Scott Eastwood, Logan Marshall-Green, Timothy Olyphant, Ben Schnetzer, LaKeith Lee Stanfield, Rhys Ifans and Nicolas Cage. It follows the life of Edward Snowden, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) subcontractor and whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) beginning in 2013. 

When Stone was first approached to helm the film, he was hesitant. At the time, he was working on another controversial subject, about the last few years in the life of Martin Luther King Jr., with Jamie Foxx attached to star, and did not immediately wish to tackle a project as incendiary again. Nonetheless, a series of events and persuasion prompted him to finally agree to direct it. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who worked with Laura Poitras to break the Snowden story, asked him for some advice; a couple of months later, Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, contacted Stone via his producer asking to meet him.

Stone travelled to Russia, where he met Snowden multiple times. He was wary over a film based on his life, but eventually gave his blessing and decided to help with the production. Although he became involved in the project, he was given no script approval, nor did he receive any payment for the film. Gordon-Levitt met Snowden as well, and pledged to donate his entire salary from the film to ""help facilitate the conversation"" about the relationship between technology and democracy.

Problems arose in Russia, however, as companies that were affiliated with the U.S. refused to become involved in the project, and no studio was ready to support it. It became extremely difficult for Stone, who had to finance everything along with the producer. Due to fear of interference by the National Security Agency, Stone decided to shoot the film mostly outside of the United States. Eventually, financing came through from France and Germany, and the film ended up being shot in Germany as a German production, with contracts being signed eight days before production began.

Well, Stone had it coming again: mixed reviews, box office failure. Ouch.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,587,519. ($28.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $37,357,216.

#**Unrealized Projects**

He had a lot of films attached as director, but never got to work on them.

- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:* So many challenges in getting this made.

- *Conan the Barbarian:* Stone wrote the script and hoped to direct it, but John Milius took over. Milius also re-wrote his script, even though they’re both credited as writers.

- *Demolished Man:* It didn't become a film because of technical limitations and Stone's busy writer-director schedule.

- *Evita:* A passion project that eventually got released in 1996, but without Stone attached.

- A Howard Hughes biopic: He worked with WB in making the film. However, since Warren Beatty owned the rights to make the film, the project never materialized.

- *Return of the Apes:* He was gonna direct a *Planet of the Apes* film, with Arnold Schwarzenegger slated to star.

- *Elektra:* He was gonna direct an adaptation of the Marvel character in 1992, but it didn’t pan out.

- *George Washington:* Robert Redford decided to produce and star in the film, charting Washington's life before the American Revolution and through his presidency. He got Stone involved as director, but it never happened.

- *Mission: Impossible 2:* Cruise got Stone attached as the director in the initial phase. Stone described his version as ""a vehicle to say something about the state of corporate culture and technology and global politics in the 21st century"". He further noted that the film's commercial nature and Cruise's star power would, in a way, ""[give him] some camouflage"" when delving into overtly political themes. Stone would hire David Marconi to write the script, but the former would ultimately leave the project for unknown reasons.

- *American Psycho:* Stone was hired to adapt the novel, which would star Leonardo DiCaprio. Had Stone directed, James Woods would have portrayed Donald Kimball and Cameron Diaz would have portrayed Evelyn Williams. Stone dropped out of the project after DiCaprio left it in favor of *The Beach*.

- *Superman:* He expressed interest in direct the film in the early 2000s, when Nicolas Cage was attached.

- *Oppenheimer:* Stone tweeted in 2023 that he was once offered to make a film based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer saying ""I couldn't find my way to its essence"" at the time.

#**The Future**

Last year, Stone said he’s working on one final film. He didn’t disclose what it was about, but referred to it as “an important narrative”.

He made 20 films, but only 19 have reported box office numbers. Across those 19 films, he made $1,489,138,647 worldwide. That's $78,375,718 per film.

#**The Verdict**

Quite inconsistent, but one thing you can absolutely hand over to Stone is that his hits are huge.

In the 80s and 90s, Stone delivered films that became word-of-mouth phenomenon. Whether they flopped or succeeded, people were talking about them. He hit it big early on, already earning 3 Oscars by 1990. Ain’t that crazy? Like him or not, the audiences were very interested in seeing what  Stone had to say. He also had a lot of power; he managed to get Coca-Cola to let them use their polar bear for *Natural Born Killers*. 8 films above $100 million worldwide is very impressive, especially considering none are based on franchises and some faced controversy. 

Now, the 21st century hasn’t been kind to Stone so far. He has directed 6 films and only one (*World Trade Center*) succeeded, while the rest ranged from underwhelming (*Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps*) and colossal disaster (*Alexander*). He still intends to make one last film, but who knows if that will truly salvage two decades of so many duds.

And to conclude, we must talk about his biggest hit, *JFK*. First of all, it’s crazy how a film like this could earn $205 million, with two-thirds of its gross coming from overseas (usually it’d be the opposite). Celebrated as a fantastic piece of filmmaking, but derided for reinforcing conspiracy theories. Roger Ebert named this as the best film of 1991, and when questioned for praising a film with so many incongruent elements, he said that it’s a fantastic fiction film. Christopher Nolan also loves the film, and you can see its influence in *Oppenheimer*. Which side are you on? 

Hope you liked this edition. You can find this and more in the [wiki for this section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)

The next director will be **Tyler Perry**. How true is that *Atlanta* episode?

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... >!David Lean.!< Yes! Another icon of the Golden Age! I love that we’re continuing with this.

This is the schedule for the following four:

Week | Director | Reasoning
:-------:|:--------:|----------
January 27-February 2 | Tyler Perry | Remember when he got angry over that *Boondocks* episode?
February 3-9 | Edward Zwick | *The Last Samurai* is damn fantastic.
February 10-16 | John Ford | The first ever director to get THREE posts.
February 17-23 | David Lean | The Master of Epics.

Who should be next after Lean? That's up to you."

none of the information attached to these people in this tree has any sources attached to it, but the account name is ‘archivjmb’ and has a “Jüdische Museum Berlin” logo as its profile picture, and has a link to the jewish museum of berlin’s archives department. the website states that “Our Archive’s collection is composed almost entirely of private donations. The approximately 1,700 sets of documents range in length from several pages to 40 archival boxes. They include writs of protection and citizenship certificates, wedding and other civil status certificates, documents of military service, of training and professional life, business, scientific, and private correspondence, diaries, and memoirs. Photographs, decorated certificates, souvenirs, and everyday objects from our other collections complement the written materials.”

i’ve messaged the account but no response so far, despite the account saying they were logged in today. their website does have some information about genealogy research on it and some links to various archives that one might search.

anyway i guess on question is it common for organizations to do research like this and could i possibly trust it as a source, especially since the information i do have matches? i know this might just be wishful thinking on my part, as sourcing is so important. i have tried in the past to look through the various archives for my relative’s areas but the websites are often not in english and very difficult for me to navigate. (these ancestors are from prussia)

if they don’t reply on ancestry soon i may send an email to the museum itself to inquire. anyone have thoughts on this or have found yourself in a similar situation? thank you! "

Well, Jake is gone. He slowed down over the last 2 weeks so I made him an appointment with other dog for today. He's been losing weight; however he's been eating, drinking and going potty. When I got home from work last night he was huffing and puffing. He was pushing to breathe. I took him to the vet this morning. The vet did an x ray and his lungs are full of masses, and since he was struggling so much to breathe, I went ahead and let him go. It was only going to get worse. He is being cremated and placed in a Cedar urn with his name engraved  on it and an insignia of a paw.

Now I'll go on a bit of a rant. Right after I posted Jake's birthday post. Someone had posted on facebook about pet taxidermy. I think they offering the service. That is all sort of wrong for me. Dogs and cats are creatures with hearts and souls, and they give them all to us. And to stuff your dog or cat, instead of letting it have a dignified burial or cremation, it's so disrespectful to that life that was given to you. I wanted to comment on the post but lost it, so I can't here.

Why You Should Rethink Your Python Toolbox in 2025,PythonLearning,1i9vqxy,2025-01-25 15:08:48,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PythonLearning/comments/1i9vqxy/why_you_should_rethink_your_python_toolbox_in_2025/,DecodeBuzzingMedium,,"Read aritcle on: [Why You Should Rethink Your Python Toolbox in 2025 | by HarshVardhan jain | Jan, 2025 | Medium](https://decodebuzzing.medium.com/why-you-should-rethink-your-python-toolbox-in-2025-3616b07b6121)

# Upgrade Your Python Toolbox for 2025: Discover the Essential Libraries You’re Missing Out On

Python’s powerful, but your tools can make you a coding god or a frustrated mess. *Don’t be that developer stuck using outdated tools while the rest of the world is speeding ahead*

**Many** developers are still heavily reliant on libraries like Pandas, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, but these aren’t always the most efficient solutions for modern development needs. In this article, we’ll explore some of the top emerging Python libraries for 2025 that will supercharge your development process and help you stay ahead of the curve.

# A) Outdated Libraries and Better Replacements

# 1. Ditch OS For File Operations: Use pathlib

The os module is often cumbersome for file and path handling due to *issues like* ***platform-specific*** *path separators and* ***verbose syntax***\*.\* pathlib simplifies this with intuitive object-oriented methods like for joining paths, .exists(), and .is\_file() for checks, making cross-platform compatibility seamless. With its cleaner syntax and built-in features, pathlib eliminates the need for manual adjustments, becoming the go-to solution for modern Python developers

# Example:

    from pathlib import Path
    
    
    # Creating a file
    file = Path(""example.txt"")
    file.write_text(""Hello, Pathlib!"")
    
    
    # Reading the file
    print(file.read_text())
    
    
    # Checking existence
    if file.exists():
        print(""File exists"")

# Why Switch?

`pathlib` just makes life easier. It’s more intuitive than `os`, with its object-oriented approach to working with files and paths. You won’t have to worry about platform-specific issues (like `\` vs `/`) because `pathlib` handles all that for you. Plus, the syntax is cleaner and more readable.

# 2. Replace Requests with httpx: A Modern HTTP Client for Asynchronous and Synchronous Requests

`HTTPS` has emerged as a powerful **alternative to requests**, especially in 2025. Unlike `requests`, HTTPX also offers **HTTP/2 support**, which can dramatically reduce latency and improve request handling by allowing multiplexed connections. `httpx`—a modern alternative that supports async operations without sacrificing the simplicity and familiarity of the Requests API.

# Example:

    import httpx
    import asyncio
    # asyncio is used to enable asynchronous programming, 
    # and it's integral to httpx for non-blocking HTTP requests.
    # With httpx, you can use async/await syntax to run multiple HTTP requests concurrently.
    
    
    # Demonstrating Asynchronous Requests with httpx
    async def async_get_data():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""Async Response:"", response.json())
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the asynchronous request
    asyncio.run(async_get_data())
    
    # Asynchronous HTTP/2 Request with httpx
    async def async_http2_request():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(http2=True) as client:
            response = await client.get('https://http2.golang.org/reqinfo')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""HTTP/2 Response:"", response.text)
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the HTTP/2 request
    asyncio.run(async_http2_request())
    
    # Connection Pooling with httpx Client
    def connection_pooling_example():
        with httpx.Client(keep_alive=True) as client:
            url = ""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1""
            # Multiple requests using connection pooling
            for _ in range(5):
                response = client.get(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    print(""Response Content:"", response.text)
                else:
                    print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the connection pooling example
    connection_pooling_example()

# Why Use httpx?

If you’re working on applications that demand **high concurrency**, such as web scraping or microservices, HTTPX’s support for **asynchronous operations** offers significant performance improvements.

>

Essentially, if you're working with a lot of I/O, `httpx` will save you a lot of headaches.

# 3. **Move Beyond Pandas: Use Polars

`Pandas`is perfect for small to mid-sized datasets, but when you throw larger datasets at it, the memory usage and performance starts to suffer.

>

`Polars` is a modern, **memory-efficient**, and **multi-threaded data processing Rust-based backend library** that provides a **faster alternative to Pandas** for large datasets. Unlike **Pandas**, Polars supports **parallel processing**, which speeds up **data manipulation** tasks

# Example:

    import polars as pl
    
    # Create a Polars DataFrame from a dictionary with sample data

# Why Polars?

So, if you’re dealing with **large-scale data processing**, need **parallel execution**, or want a **memory-efficient** solution, **Polars** is the superior choice for modern data science and analytics..Pandas might be your first love, but `Polars` is the one who can handle the heavy lifting.

# 4. Upgrade Your Testing Game: Replace unittest with pytest

`unittest`? Sure, it works, but come on, it’s 2025. You ain’t pulling any bitches with that. It’s like trying to impress someone with a flip phone when everyone’s rocking iPhones. Yeah, it works, but it’s a total hassle. `pytest`\*\*: it’s the cool, modern testing framework that makes writing and reading tests way easier.\*\*

# Wait, What’s unittest?

For the uninitiated, `unittest` is Python's built-in testing framework, but it ***often feels outdated with verbose syntax and repetitive boilerplate***. With, you get powerful features like flexible fixture management, automatic test discovery, and built-in parameterization (using u/pytest`.mark.parametrize`) to easily run the same test with different inputs. It also supports parallel test execution via `pytest-xdist`, which boosts performance for large test suites.

# Example:

    # test_sample.py
    
    # Importing pytest library for testing
    import pytest
    
    # Simple function to add two numbers
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y  
    
    # Test function to check if add(x, y) returns the correct result
    def test_add():  # Note: function started with ""test_""
        # Checking if 2 + 3 equals 5
        assert add(2, 3) == 5  # If the add function works, this should pass
        # No output is printed because pytest handles the test results automatically
    
    # Expected output after running pytest:
    # ===================== test session starts =====================
    # collected 1 item
    # 
    # test_sample.py .                                        [100%]
    # 
    # ===================== 1 passed in 0.03 seconds =====================

# Why test_?

By using the `test_` prefix, you make it clear to pytest that these functions are supposed to be tests. It’s part of pytest's convention to discover and run the correct functions without any additional configuration.

# Libraries That Deserve More Attention in 2025

# 1. BeeWare for Cross-Platform Python App Development

BeeWare is an emerging Python framework that deserves more attention, especially in 2025. It allows Python developers to write native apps across multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, web) using the same codebase. Unlike traditional desktop frameworks like PyQt or Tkinter, BeeWare goes further by enabling deployment on Android, iOS, and even WebAssembly. **One key feature of BeeWare is its cross-platform nature, so you can write an app once and run it everywhere.**

# Getting Started with BeeWare

Before running the examples, make sure you have BeeWare installed. Follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial-0.html#install-dependencies) to set up your environment.

Demande de conseils pour négocier une rupture conventionnelle initiée par l’entreprise,VosSous,1i9vpqr,2025-01-25 15:07:20,6,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/VosSous/comments/1i9vpqr/demande_de_conseils_pour_négocier_une_rupture/,Mental_Rough4029,,"Bonjour à tous,

Je viens chercher vos lumières pour une négociation de rupture conventionnelle que mon entreprise a initiée.

Je voulais poster sur r/conseiljuridique mais on m’a préconisé de le faire sur r/vosfinances qui m'a redirigé ici.

 Voici ma situation :

Âge : 28 ans

Poste : Cadre manager dans l’informatique

Salaire annuel : \~55K brut (environ 3300 € supernet mensuel)

Localisation : Région parisienne

Ancienneté : En poste depuis juillet 2022 (2 ans et demi)

L’entreprise traverse une restructuration et n’a plus besoin de mes services, spécifiquement pour lesquelles ils m’avaient recruté. Ils m’ont donc proposé de nous séparer à l’amiable. Ayant vu le coup venir, je m’étais déjà renseigné en amont et leur ai proposé une indemnité correspondant à 6 mois de salaire, en plus de mon solde de tout compte et des 6 semaines de préavis (car j’anticipe le délai lié aux démarches).

Voici mes arguments principaux :

Pression morale constante depuis plusieurs mois :

Mes deux managers ont fait un burn-out.

Deux collègues ont été licenciés l’année dernière.

Un collègue plus senior (sans lien hiérarchique direct) m’a fait des remarques sur ma tenue vestimentaire lors d’une soirée d’entreprise. J’avais remonté l’incident aux RH, mais cela a été classé sans suite.

Le contexte de la rupture :

Mon N+2 m’a convoqué sous prétexte d’un autre sujet, mais c’était un guet-apens avec la DRH pour me proposer cette rupture.

Quand ils m’ont fait leur proposition, j’ai directement annoncé mes attentes (les 6 mois de salaire, correspondant à plus ou moins 27K), ce qui les a laissés sans voix. Ils m’ont dit qu’ils allaient refaire leurs calculs et revenir vers moi d’ici une semaine.

Plusieurs points à préciser : 

\- Je suis très au courant que les indemnités décaleront l'ARE. 

\- Si il le faut, j'irai au tribunal, j'ai de la chance d'avoir bien pu épargner donc l'argent n'est (pour l'instant) pas un problème

\- Je suis propriétaire de ma RP dont le crédit tire jusqu’à 2047, fiancé et potentiellement en attente d'un enfant

Mes questions :

Ma demande d’indemnités est-elle cohérente ? Si non, quel serait un montant plus réaliste ? Ces 6 mois ne sortent pas de nulle part, ils correspondent à peu près à l'argent qu'ils devraient débourser pour me licencier dans les mêmes conditions.

Quels conseils me donneriez-vous pour gérer la prochaine réunion avec eux ? Dois-je formaliser ma demande par écrit ?

Y a-t-il des erreurs classiques à éviter dans ce genre de négociation ?

Merci d’avance pour vos retours, je veux m’assurer de bien gérer cette étape délicate. Toute expérience ou insight sera précieux !"

Le parquet national antiterroriste (PNAT) s’est saisi de l'affaire. 

Un homme armé d'un couteau a pénétré dans un supermarché à Apt (Vaucluse) ce samedi en début de soirée, où il a agressé un client se trouvant au niveau des caisses, en hurlant ""Allah Akbar"". La victime, qui a reçu un coup de couteau et des coups de poing, a été blessée au niveau de la tête. Son pronostic vital ne serait néanmoins pas engagé. L'agresseur a été rapidement maîtrisé par un agent de sécurité.

Les faits se sont déroulés vers 18 heures. Le suspect, Mehdi B., qui serait âgé de 32 ans, est déjà connu des services de police pour une quinzaine de faits. Il est inscrit au FSPRT (fichier de traitement des signalements pour la prévention de la radicalisation à caractère terroriste), et a été placé en garde à vue.

Le parquet national antiterroriste (PNAT) s'est saisi de ce dossier, a appris Actu17. Selon nos informations, le suspect est suivi pour sa radicalisation mais également pour son profil psychiatrique."
"""I will not longer be coming to church because the Pope speaking out against Trump's deportation!"" Well ma'am, the church isn't a business. You not showing up doesn't change anything.",BoomersBeingFools,1i9vobm,2025-01-25 15:05:33,711,0.99,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1i9vobm/i_will_not_longer_be_coming_to_church_because_the/,T1DOtaku,,"I've had to deal with these kinds of people all the time but today I got a phone call from a women who said just that. I kindly asked her if she truly believes in Jesus and his teachings. She obviously said yes. I then told her that then she should stick to her faith and not let it be shaken by the politics of the world. This is a matter of her spiritual wellbeing. Her not attending church doesn't ""send a message to the Pope"" it only hurts herself. I also told her that the Washington Post isn't a direct source from the Vatican and should really be checking what was actually said (she brought up some other things that were, in fact, the media spinning it out of proportion). I reassured her that all she can do it pray in these hard times and sent her on her way. 

Now to take the polite, customer service, good little Christian mask off for a sec, I can't fucking stand these people and their lack on conviction or moral understanding. ""That's just not right!"" What's not right about speaking up against someone who is trying to destroy the very foundation of this country? What's not right speaking about showing basic dignity and respect to your fellow man? What's actually not right, and what the Bible actually preaches is about letting corrupt religious leaders silence people preaching a gossip of peace and understanding. The Pharisees hates him for daring to hold them accountable and shake up the status quo but no one nowadays wants to hear that! No one what's to remember that the Good Samaritan would have been an outcast and hated but was the only one who did the right thing. If Jesus was here in the modern day he would have used an illegal immigrant to get his point across. No one what's to remember how it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven. Funny how they forget that verse when praising the godhead Elon or his high priest Trump. Almost everything in the New Testament especially would show how Trump is the farthest thing from being any kind of ""Christian"" leader. He is corrupt. He is uncaring. He is greedy. He is prideful. He is someone more Christian should be calling out and shunning, but no. Most Christians are only ""Christian"" in name and not in actions. Fuck them. Fuck every single one of them. I'm still here out of spite, so I can throw everything they've ever taught me right back at them. To make them actually pay attention to what they claim to believe. "
Question about my passport application (name/sex update) TSA pre check/Clear member,Passports,1i9vn50,2025-01-25 15:04:04,3,0.8,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/1i9vn50/question_about_my_passport_application_namesex/,sweetgurldfw,Application Question / Discussion,"Hello everyone I'm very aware of the updated changes that's going on this year regarding the gender/sex update with the new EO. 
It has been 15 years since I was issued a temporary limited passport in Panama (overseas) that I had to renew within 60 days, however I did not renew within the limited time frame which resulted in my passport being expired in 2010 and it was lost as well. 
 
I have my name and sex marker legally changed basically on everything from BC (California born), SS #, voters registration, my driver's license, my bank etc literally everything. And I also am a frequent flyer as I have TSA PreCheck as well and I also am a CLEAR passenger as well with my name and sex legally updated to my driver's license. During the application process here at the University of Texas in Dallas everything seemed fine, as the person assisted me did request additional verification so I brought my social security card along with my voters registration updated with sex to F and name.
 I'm here in the DFW area and I submitted the application with expedited service on January 22nd which was this Wednesday and I would like to know what are my chances of having my new passport updated correctly?

Nairobi:

Tribe Hotel – Nairobi – [https://www.tribe-hotel.com/](https://www.tribe-hotel.com/)

The bathrooms are uh, not good for couples or families. You will hear, smell everything, and see some things.

This hotel is located near the US Embassy and the UN headquarters. It is safe and there is a huge mall across the street. The hotel is clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was lively at night and we enjoyed the cocktails.

We took a tour via UJV and Martin, who took us to the Elephant Orphanage, Giraffe Center, and then the Karen Blixen Museum.  It was nice to see the city while driving between venues. We enjoyed all of these activities but a word of caution with the Giraffe Center that it is more of a zoo than a conservancy. When you arrive, you will be given a dish of food to feed the Giraffes. The Giraffes have options to not interact at least.

Lodge 1:

Wilson Airport to Amboseli

Angama Amboseli - [https://angama.com/](https://angama.com/)

We flew into the airport within the Amboseli National Park, however there is a private airstrip in the Kimana Conservancy. We were met with breakfast at the airstrip and then were able to see Amboseli before heading to Angama. In a perfect world, I would land at Amboseli and fly out at the private airstrip. It’s about 1 hour 40 minutes to the airstrip at the national park from Angama. Our guide, Salash, was fabulous! Every game drive was private.

The resort is beautiful and located in the private Kimana Conservancy. The cottages are gorgeous. The bathroom is huge, with a two-person shower and a large room with a toilet and a door! There is an outdoor sitting area and an outdoor shower. The cottages do not get too hot and we were quite comfortable during our stay. James was our room attendant, and everything was perfect. He did far more laundry for us than he should have.

From our room, we were able to see quite a bit of wildlife! Elephants, monkeys, etc. The conservancy does have cats but the elephants, hippos, and all the other animals are why you visit. We were even able to meet Craig!

They don’t have a gym. They have a pool and offer a “gym bag” in your room. They offer beading, weaving, and photography classes.

Their beverage program was amazing. Lots of wonderful South African wines that we wish we could get in the USA. The food has some room to get better but I figure [u/DorsiaTravel ](https://www.reddit.com/user/DorsiaTravel/)will fix them right up when he visits soon.

This resort needs bug spray.

Lodge 2:

Amboseli to Lewa - We were supposed to fly back to Wilson but the SafariLink added a few stops and flew “direct” instead.

Elewana Kifaru House - [https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance](https://www.elewanacollection.com/kifaru-house-lewa/at-a-glance)

This lodge has 5 cottages at the top of the hill for great views. The cottages are clean, comfortable, and cool. The weather at Lewa is quite a bit cooler which also means you don’t need bug spray. They do warn you to keep the lights off at night so that moths are not attracted.

Our guide, Phillip, was terrific. There were issues with the car, so we ended up having an extra guide, Michael, to help drive. All the drives happen within the Lewa Conservancy. We were able to see white and black rhinos, cheetahs, elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes, bush babies, and several baby lions!

The food and beverage were fine, with no complaints. The chef ensured I had fresh-baked gluten-free breads (I have celiac) and even made me gluten-free churros!

Lodge 3:

Lewa to Samburu – we had a chartered flight and flew direct (15 minute flight).

Saruni Samburu - [https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/](https://sarunibasecamp.com/our-properties/saruni-samburu/)

This lodge is located within Kalama Conservancy but all the animals were within the Samburu National Reserve. During the rainy periods, the game drives would be within Kalama.

This place is magical. Kalama is semi-arid and very hot. Despite this, the rooms were cool at night and we were comfortable. It was very hot during the day but there are two pools to cool down. Because the rooms are built into the side of the mountain, you can get a nice wind tunnel to keep the rooms cool. I will say that this place is not very accessible. If you are scared of heights, have any physical challenges, or younger kids, you might skip this place. They have a great gift shop too!

Samoru was our guide and he was fantastic. He’s an elder in the Samburu tribe and went out of his way to find us a leopard. We also saw a red spitting cobra, stripped hyena, leopard, rock hyrax, and so much more.

Saitoti was our food and beverage person and he was such an amazing teacher. We learned a lot about his culture and his language! They even had gluten free pasta for me.

Lodge 4:

Samburu to Keekorok (Masai Mara)

JW Marriott - [https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nbomj-jw-marriott-masai-mara-lodge/overview/)

This lodge is located very close to the local community and we could hear goats, cows, and kids playing in the river from our room. The cottages are beautiful. Ours had a (very cold) pool and a sauna. We were also treated with some very cute guests who left us a free presents on our deck, 10 or so baboons!

 They have a rotating menu but will make you anything you want with enough time. Anything. The beverage program was reasonable and included quite a few high-end options.

We were staying here on points and I am guessing most folks were also. I do not believe the service was up to the same level as the other lodges but this resort still expects 2,600/night for 2 people. The issues were issues and one of them was serious.

 ·      They feed me gluten even though I have celiac. I mentioned needing gluten-free food at every meal. I found out the last morning that the hashbrowns have gluten.

·      The rooms are at least 10 degrees hotter than the outside temperature during the day.

·      Only one side of the bed had a heating pad.

·      The game drives happened in a public park, and it was a rodeo. The animals were stressed, we were worried, and it was not a good situation for anyone.

·      It does not seem like you have dedicated staff like other lodges.

·      You are limited to 10 laundry items for the lodge, 5 per person a day. This is no limit at other lodges.

·      Shared game drives unless you paid for a private one. This meant we were with a couple that wanted to see “a kill” which we were not interested in. When our guide heard about a lion killing a warthog, we had to leave a beautiful leopard and speed over to the scene. It was pretty horrifying because the warthog was still alive while the lion was eating it. The lion got spooked by all the guides (mostly JW vehicles) jockeying for position and left the warthog. The warthog tried to get up despite missing internal organs. It was horrifying. We had to listen to people laughing while watching it.

·      It is very Westernized. They had a bar, they had music on, and everyone was using their “Christian” name.

·      Make sure you pay your park fees before arriving if possible because you need cash otherwise. The hotel will not make this easier for you. You must have the $200 in cash, hope their credit card machine works (it didn’t one day), or go to an ATM.

·      The pre-approval questionnaire was not looked at before or after our arrival.

I know their reviews are excellent, and I am guessing that is because people are going to this lodge and have not experienced other lodges or conservancies in Kenya.

Just created my first script and systemd service! (for kiwix),selfhosted,1i9vjca,2025-01-25 14:59:42,2,0.63,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i9vjca/just_created_my_first_script_and_systemd_service/,verticalfuzz,Guide,"I was very excited to get my first systemd service to work with a lot of hand-wringing before starting out, but actually very little fuss once I sat down to it.

I installed [kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/) on a proxmox LXC, which comes with kiwix-search (searches, I guess), kiwix-manage (builds a library xml file) and kiwix-serve (lets you brows your offline copy of wikipedia, stackexchange, or whatever. The install does not build a service to update the library or run kiwix-serve on boot. 

I found [this tutorial](https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2021/12/09/self-hosting-wikipedia/) which only sort-of worked for me. In my case, passing a directory to kiwix-serve starts the server, but basically serves an empty library. 

So instead, I did the following:

create a script, /kiwix/start-kiwix.sh:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Update the libary with everything in /kiwix/zim
    kiwix-manage /kiwix/library/kiwix.xml add /kiwix/zim/*
    
    # Start the sever (note absense of --daemon flag to run in same process)
    kiwix-serve --port=8000 --library /kiwix/library/kiwix.xml

Create a group kiwix and user kiwix inside the lxc

    # create group kiwix
    groupadd kiwix --gid 23005
    
    # create user kiwix
    adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-password --disabled-login --uid 23005 --gid 21001 kiwix

chown the script to kiwix:kiwix and give the group execute permissions, then modify lxc.conf with the following two lines to give the kiwix lxc user access to the folder with /zim stuff

    lxc.mount.entry: /path/to/kiwix kiwix none bind,create=dir,rw 0 0
    lxc.hook.pre-start: sh -c ""chown -R 123005:123005 /path/to/kiwix"" #kiwix user in lxc

Back in the lxc, create a systemd service that calls my script under the user kiwix. This is *nearly* the same as the service unit in the tutorial linked above, but instead of calling kiwix-serve it calls my script.

/etc/systemd/system/kiwix.service:

    [Unit]
    Description=Serve all the ZIM files loaded on this server
    
    [Service]
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=15
    User=kiwix
    ExecStart=/kiwix/start-kiwix.sh
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=network-online.target

Then run`systemctl enable kiwix --now` and it works! Stopping and starting the service stops and starts the server (and on start, it is hopefully then also updating the library xml). And when the LXC boots, it also starts the service and kiwix-server automatically!"

"Dell XPS 15 consistent issues with power, shutdowns, startups, charging etc.",techsupport,1i9vio6,2025-01-25 14:58:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1i9vio6/dell_xps_15_consistent_issues_with_power/,estoytom,Open | Hardware,"Hi all, I recently purchased a Dell XPS 15 7590 from my workplace as they were doing a charity sale. I'm aware that the model is slightly old now, but with 32GB RAM, an i7 and a decent Nvidia graphics card, it was a deal that I couldn't turn down. On the first day, the device worked fine. Since then, there has been non-stop consistent issues which has basically registered the device unusable at least at this current moment. The following are the issues that I've faced:

* Inconsistent booting and powerup. At this current point, I cannot make the device turn on. I installed some updates on the device when it was on and after restarting it would not power on. I've tried following the hard reset and power cycle guides online and while they seem to work and the keyboard backlight comes on, the power light and fans come on, they only remain on for a few seconds before powering off. I'm trying everything including unplugging the charger, power cycling and I even took the back of the laptop off to remove and drain the battery to start again. Sometimes I get the flashing white and orange indicator.
* System Service Tag. I've set the service tag twice now, yet the PC just doesn't seem to remember it. I boot from BIOS and set the service tag. I've seen that some others have had this issue and one of the forums on the Dell website said to update the BIOS to the latest version, which is what I did, but the issue still persists.
* Only running in Manufacturing Mode. The only way that I'm able to run the laptop consistently is in Manufacturing mode. On startup, I get a black screen saying the laptop is in manufacturing mode and if I press Alt + F, it'll turn off. If I turn manufacturing mode off, the laptop works for a couple of minutes, then shuts off completely, very rarely wanting to turn back on, which makes it super annoying when trying to reproduce the issue. The PC seems to run fine in manufacturing mode, but this causes the PCs fans to run at 100%, which is both noisy and also cannot be good for the PC in the long-term. Even after starting up in manufacturing mode, signing in and pressing Fn + x, the fans power down and after a couple of seconds, the PC shuts off again. It even also sometimes shuts down while in manufacturing mode, which is something that has just happened after trying to reset my pin to log in.
* Consistent unexpected shutdowns. The PC just shuts down randomly. After signing in (in normal mode), it could take a couple of minutes but the PC just shuts down and it's very difficult to turn it back on. It takes a combination of different patterns of holding the power button, plugging and unplugging the charger, powercycling to power it back on. It often takes just leaving it for 30 minutes before it decides it wants to power on again.
* Inconsistent charging. I noticed yesterday that while the charger is fully functional and works as expected, sometimes the PC won't charge. It's very intermittent if it decides that it wants to charge.
* SecurityHealthSSO.dll warning. When logging into the device, I often get a SecurityHealthSSO.dll warning. I've run diagnostics on terminal including sfc /scannow and DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth, but everything returns as normal.

I've read on some of the Dell forums about potentially a bad motherboard or replacing the heat sink, but I'm not a hardware guy and I'm nervous that I would mess it up. This Dell user seems to be having similar problems to me, but nobody has replied to his thread on the Dell forums [https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/xps/xps-15-random-shutdowns-and-missed-restarts-manufacturer-mode-and-caps-lock-stuck-on/66409e022334016b0ea4c388](https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/xps/xps-15-random-shutdowns-and-missed-restarts-manufacturer-mode-and-caps-lock-stuck-on/66409e022334016b0ea4c388). What's the play here? Do I return it to work and say it's faulty? I've contacted Dell and they've quoted me £350 for a replacement motherboard. Do I take it to a computer repair shop and try to fix it there? I've never experienced this level of multitude of issues before and honestly don't know where to turn to solve it. I've done a lot of research and have found that many others are experiencing the same issues that I am."

We are currently going under a rebuild as the original owner has stepped down and given me ownership of Maple Strike. Since that happened, I am turning the team from a beer league to a serious roster with 5 players and a coach.

  
We have played in ESEA Season 51 Open and went 8-6 in regular and 1-1 in playoffs. Now in Season 52, with 2 of our critical players leaving before the season started and forcing us to find several stand-ins, we are 0-4 and are in a huge issue with our roster, which is why I'm making posts here. The coach role will work together with our IGL (who we are experimenting one person with) to create gameplans, coach us in games and help us with practices.

"From Mr. Finntastic to Ginja: Navigating Loss, Love, and New Beginnings",Shihtzu,1i9vi5r,2025-01-25 14:58:13,8,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vi5r,VegasK8lyn,Loss of Pet,"Hi everyone! New member here, but definitely not new to loving Shih Tzus.  

Quick question: have any of you felt guilty about getting a new puppy soon after losing one? I can’t shake the feeling that my dearly departed Finnegan—aka *Mr. Finntastic*—is looking down on me like, “Wow, already moving on, huh?” I know, I know…I sound like I’m talking about an ex-husband, not a dog. 🤦‍♀️  

Fin’s passing was so sudden. He was diagnosed with lymphoma on the 6th and gone by the 7th. It all happened so fast, I cried myself sick. He was my rock, my buddy through every storm, and the best dog I could have ever asked for. At six, he still thought he was a puppy—always full of bliss. Before he passed, I couldn’t imagine wanting another dog. I used to joke, “God doesn’t want me going postal, so Mr. Finntastic is staying with me for a *long* time.” Oh, how wrong I was. 💔😭  

Last weekend, while curled up with a cold and a mountain of grief, I started poking around online for rescues. I inquired about a few, only to get automated responses asking me to fill out forms before I could even talk to someone. Frustrated, I figured it wasn’t meant to be and stopped looking.  

Then, enter *Mother Dearest.* Unprovoked, she started sending me listings for puppies from a reputable breeder Saturday night. 🤦‍♀️ And let’s just say, I was powerless. Especially after learning *she* had decided to get a Shih Tzu puppy herself. I’m not sure if her decision gave me permission to consider it or if this was God working through her, but what happened next felt like fate.  

Backstory: My brother—my Irish twin—was murdered in July 2022, just after returning stateside from his twelfth deployment. His last night was spent celebrating his favorite holiday, the Fourth of July, something he’d missed many times during his service. Tragically, he was senselessly murdered that night. It’s been devastating for my family, losing him in such a brutal, unexpected way. For years, we worried about the dangers overseas—never imagining the threat would be here at home.  

Through that heartbreak, Mr. Finntastic was my rock. He had the heart of a hero and the mind of a psychic (minus the scam). He always seemed to know when I needed comfort. I would talk to him, and he’d “answer” in snores, like he actually understood. He was hilarious, too—once, at the boarding kennel, two howling beagles started up, and Fin decided he *had* to join in. His howling was terrible, but boy, did he try. Everyone was cracking up. He was the best—a true dog’s dog and my best friend.  

And now, here’s where the new puppy comes in. My brother was a redhead, and when I saw this puppy, with fur the same shade of red, it reminded me of him. It even made me think of his favorite silly joke: *“What do you call a red-headed ninja?”* A *Ginja.* So now I’m thinking this little guy’s name should be Ginja, which feels so perfect.  

But here I am, feeling guilty. Has anyone else gone through this? Or am I just crazy (as only Mr. Finntastic truly understood)? 🫣😂  
 

 TLDR:  
Lost my beloved Shih Tzu, Mr. Finntastic, suddenly to lymphoma. He was my rock, my clown, and my best friend. Grieving has been brutal, but fate led me to a new puppy whose red fur reminded me of my late brother's favorite joke: *“What do you call a red-headed ninja? A Ginja.”* Now I’m feeling both excited and guilty about bringing Ginja home. Anyone else been through this rollercoaster of emotions? 🫣😂  "

They approach the client by either saying that you applied for a loan through “an affiliate” or they send you a mailer saying you prequalified for a good interest loan, with no intetion of giving you that loan. The waste your time by pretending that it is a real loan application, but it's only to lure you in, and after denying you, they offer their actual product which is debt settlement. which you almost certainly won’t receive. They target people with significant debt, having purchased their information from the three credit bureaus, knowing in advance that these individuals won’t qualify for a loan. The goal is to “bait” clients with the promise of a loan and the hope of financial relief. After inquiring about your personal life and finances, they place you on hold under the pretense of submitting your file for qualification (spoiler: they have no intention of checking your eligibility). Then, they proceed to “switch” to offering their actual product: Debt Settlement.

“Bait and switch” is a deceptive marketing tactic where a business advertises a product or service at a low price (the “bait”) to attract customers, but once the customer shows interest, they are pressured or persuaded to buy a more expensive or less desirable product (the “switch”). In this case, the switch is Debt Settlement. This practice is generally considered unethical and may be illegal in many jurisdictions.

I believe most of the agents are stationed in the Middle East for cheaper labor based on their accents. Despite using fake white or Hispanic names, their last names are almost always Arab, which you can quickly verify with a simple Google search.

In my view, this is degenerate behavior, as the vast majority of their clients have a FICO score below 500. According to TransUnion, less than 5% of the population has a FICO score below 500, which means they are specifically targeting the most vulnerable segment of society for profit.

These businesses shouldn't open in an Islamic nation since what they do is essentially prohibited(haram).

they will probably take this down so keep sharing the truth."

Composer vs Chat Discussion,cursor,1i9ve6x,2025-01-25 14:53:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1i9ve6x/composer_vs_chat_discussion/,justmud,,"As this tool is evolving super quickly, I thought I'd add some context here after spending a couple of weeks of heavy usage. By heavy usage, I mean attempting to build out an n-tiered application on AWS that involves a VPC, multi-az, API Gateway, multiple lambda functions, step functions, SQS queues and SNS topics, elasticsearch, Route53, all the logging and monitoring you'd expect, IAM users, roles, policies, etc....all tied together. All created via Terraform. Lambdas in python. Addtionally, a super simplistic UI in nextjs connected to a C# API. 

Zero lines of code written by me so far, on purpose. So, really beating up the agent. The most I've done is point it to Stackoverflow posts when it gets stuck and starts looping through the same attempted solutions (which it will do without guidance, so beware).

Basically, I treat it like an incredibly talented, adaptable junior dev with a faultless memory who never needs a pizza or a Redbull and never complains.

I did 100% of this work by talking to the Composer. Well... 99.999999%. I recently discovered that CMD+K is nice for quick inline fixes for one or two lines of code in one file. And today, needing to get serious about security considerations before I racked up a truckload of tech debt, decide to start transitioning to a VPC. Hence the higher level conversation that did not need to immediately result in code changes.   
  
Anyway...here's the conversation I just had with the Chat agent because I was similarly confused. 

So here's the conversation. I found it illuminating...and shamelessly self-congratulatory in the last sentence. Not that I disagree. ;P

  
  
**When i talk to you via the Chat feature you do not automatically start creating files or modifying existing ones. That's good for general discussions. How do I make the transition from architectural discussion in Cursor Chat to implementation in the Cursor Composer?** 

  
The transition from Chat (architectural discussions) to Composer (implementation) is typically done by:For example, if you wanted to start implementing the VPC infrastructure we just discussed, you could:The key difference is that Composer works in the context of specific files, while Chat is better for broader discussions and planning.Would you like to start implementing any specific part of the architecture we discussed?

**Ok cool. And when we discuss complicated topics here that generate a lot of output, is there a consistent way to tag parts of the discussion to make it easy for the composer to reference?**

Yes! There are several effective ways to tag or reference parts of our Chat discussions for Composer:

    [ARCH-1] VPC Architecture
    [ARCH-2] Security Groups
    [ARCH-3] Data Flow

* Use specific reference tags for code examples:

&#8203;

    #CODE_REF: vpc_setup
    resource ""aws_vpc"" ""main"" {
      // ...
    }

* Use descriptive labels for decision points:

&#8203;

    #DECISION: vpc_endpoints
    - Decided to use VPC Endpoints for AWS services
    - Rationale: Keep traffic private, improve security

Then in Composer, you can reference these markers:""Please implement the VPC configuration we discussed in \[ARCH-1\] and the security groups from #CODE\_REF: vpc\_setup""Would you like to try this tagging approach with our previous architectural discussion?

**sure**

Let me reorganize our previous discussion with clear tags:\[ARCH-1\] High-Level Architecture

\[ARCH-1\] High-Level Architecture

    External -> API Gateway -> VPC -> Private Services
    Primary Use Case: Webhook Document Ingestion

\[ARCH-2\] Network Layout

    VPC Structure:
    ├── Public Subnets
    │   └── NAT Gateway
    └── Private Subnets
        ├── Lambda Functions
        ├── Aurora
        ├── OpenSearch
        └── VPC Endpoints
    

\[SEC-1\] Security Components

    - API Gateway: Entry point security
    - VPC Endpoints: Private AWS service access
    - Security Groups: Service-to-service access control
    - Private Subnets: Isolated compute resources

\[FLOW-1\] Data Flow Pattern

    Webhook -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> {DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Aurora, S3}

\[CODE-1\] Example Security Group Pattern

    resource ""aws_security_group"" ""lambda"" {
      name        = ""lambda-sg""
      vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
    
      ingress {
        from_port       = 443
        to_port         = 443
        protocol        = ""tcp""
        prefix_list_ids = [aws_vpc_endpoint.execute_api.prefix_list_id]
      }
    }

Now you can open a Terraform file in Composer and reference these sections specifically, like ""Help me implement the network layout from \[ARCH-2\]"" or ""Let's implement the security group pattern from \[CODE-1\]"".Would you like to start implementing any of these components?

**No need, as I already started implementing. I just wasn't sure if Chat and Composer shared session context.** 

Ah, I understand your question now. No, Chat and Composer don't directly share session context - they operate as separate systems. However, you can explicitly reference our Chat discussions in Composer by:This separation can actually be beneficial because:Would you like me to explain any other aspects of how Chat and Composer interact (or don't interact)?

**Well, you say that context is not directly shared, but it sounds like via tag reference Composer can access the output from Chat that is available here client-side. So the context is not shared in sessions in the cloud behind the GPT, but can be shared client-side to smooth the use of the toolchain**

Exactly right! You've made an important distinction:This is similar to how developers might:The tagging system essentially creates a local ""documentation bridge"" between the architectural discussions in Chat and the implementation work in Composer. Pretty clever design by the Cursor team!"
AITA for not honoring my sort of ex who was most likely a scammer's last request after he sorta dumped me?,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i9vddx,2025-01-25 14:52:08,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9vddx/aita_for_not_honoring_my_sort_of_ex_who_was_most/,Altruistic-Apple-99,AITA,"I (28M) met my online sorta ex BF (Allegedly 34M) in July on a dating website. At first we only talked every once in a while and he explained that he was in the military. It was while we were talking about our occupations so I didn't think anything of it. Eventually our conversations fizzled out and I assumed that was the end of it. However, I live in an area that was hit by one of the summer hurricanes and he reached out again right before it hit. Long story within a story short messaging him helped me get through the hurricane and we started messaging each other daily after that.

By October we ended up moving to Telegram and that's when he revealed that he had a huge inheritance and wanted me to be his sugar baby. I immediately assumed he was a scammer but I didn't want to do anything rash in case he was legit. I haven't been in any sort of serious relationship in over a decade and my previous serious relationship ended so horribly that I was left with a fear of dating ever since that I never thought I would get over. Also, there were other instances of me ruining friendships by assuming the worst in people and jumping to conclusions. I responded that I wasn't looking for that sort of relationship and assumed that if he was a scammer he would stop ghost me, block me, or both. He didn't, so I started to increase my hopes just a little bit, though there was an itty bitty feeling in my gut telling me not to get too attached to him.

As our messaging went on, he told me all of these stories about himself being an orphan, having all of these traumatic events in both his military and civilian life, and me being the only person who ever got him to open up. With each story I did some snooping to see if they were at least plausible and could never find any evidence that could contradict his claims. With each picture he sent me I would scour google images and stock photo sites to see if they checked out and to this day they do(I didn't learn about reverse google images til after the story ended). He claimed to get deployed to a middle eastern country right before Thanksgiving and would tell me that I was his motivator for getting through it and coming home. Then he called me on Thanksgiving right before he was allegedly going on a dangerous mission. Unfortunately for me, the call was made a little before midnight after I spent the day eating, drinking heavily, and being merry with my family so when I heard he had an accent that kept going back and forth between east asian and American I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating or not. When I asked about it he said he was born in an east asian country and moved here when he was young. Another plausible explanation, but this time the dread in my gut was more noticeable.

It wasn't long after that that he claimed to be seriously injured and stuck in the hospital telling me that I was the only one getting him through his predicament. That's when it happened.(pause for dramatic effect) He asked me to send him money. He gave me some story about not having access to his bank account because he's in a war zone or something. It was then that I started googling scams. In the couple of hours it took to fall down that rabbit hole and figure out if or how I would respond there was a follow up message telling me to forget about it followed by another followup message making a pathetic attempt to shame me for taking too long to respond. Keep in mind it had been 5 or 6 hours. Also keep in mind I had waited entire weeks for him to respond to me without complaint even when I knew he had read it long before the week was up. That's when I called him out without calling him out. I told him why I was taking so long and listed some of the bad vibes he was giving without straight up accusing him. He went on a long rant giving me an alleged explanation. This is when I should have cut and run but another friend of mine had just ruined a relationship a few days before this incident by calling someone he was messaging online that gave off scammer vibes out and that person ended up being completely innocent and although they technically made up the relationship was never the same and ended up fizzling out, so I ended up giving him one more chance. Another long story within a story short we talked through it and made up, but this time I made sure to keep my expectations low again.

As Christmas neared I learned that I had to give up on the career path I had been pursuing and was back to the drawing board on finding a new one. I was so depressed, lost, and scared that I ended up having to use suicide prevention services. He was the one who gave me the pep talk and support I needed to pick myself up and make it to the holidays. Then, it happened again.(Pause for another dramatic effect) He asked me for my credit card info and gave me the frozen bank account story again. This time I assumed the worst but kept my scammer accusations to myself and told him that I wasn't comfortable with that til we met in person. I assumed if he was a scammer he would give up on me at that point but he didn't. He said he understood and would tough it out and that he was almost done with his deployment. It was then that I decided to narrow down my scam research  to military romance scams. After going down that rabbit hole I became more convinced than ever that he was a scammer. The only thing that kept me from blocking him then and there was that we had been messaging for months and I had refused his money related advances on multiple occasions. I had never heard of scammers playing the long game this long without receiving at least a little money. Fortunately he made the choice for me. A few days later a gave me this heartfelt sendoff message. Basically told me to forget about him and think of him every now and then. He asked that I send him a picture of myself or video chat him as a sendoff gift since I had yet to show him what I look like. I'm usually very cautious about strangers on the internet so none of my profile pictures have my face. I was saving the big reveal for when we met in person or video chatted but I didn't see the point in him knowing after dumping my sexy ass so I was basically like ""K bye"" and thought that was the end of it.

Spoiler! It wasn't. A week later he sent me entire paragraphs calling me every name in the book, making pathetic attempts to shame me for not sending him money to get home (yet he somehow made it home without my help), telling me that I used him as a penpal(Is that even a thing?), and trying to guilt me for not honoring his request(he expected me to reward him for dumping me?). It wouldn't be the first time that someone who was giving me all the telltale sides of something negative ended up being the one in a million exception and was totally innocent. After all, even with all of my research there's still so much about the military that the internet can't teach me. Since we never met in person I never really considered us official so I guess it wasn't a full on breakup but I was still guilty when I started writing this story. However, as I'm finishing it I realize that if this is how he reacts when he doesn't get what he wants I don't want him even if he is legit.

AITA for not honoring my sort of ex who was most likely a scammer's last request after he sorta dumped me or should I have given him a parting gift?

Also, is there anywhere I should send the little information I have in case he is a scammer or am I better off blocking him? I don't want to delete any evidence if it will help."

*“How should I tell the priest about my sins? Is a feeling of repentance indispensable during confession? After confession, should one expect a feeling of spiritual relief, or lightness of soul? These beginners’ questions often remain troublesome even for very experienced parishioners. Many of us are too fainthearted to “waste a priest’s time” with such “simple and insignificant” questions. In order to fill in this gap about confession, such “simple and insignificant” questions were given by our NS correspondent Dmitry Rebrov to the highly-respected Protopriest Valerian Krechetov, the senior father-confessor**^(\[1\])* *in the Moscow Diocese and head priest of the Church of the Protection in the village of Akulovo, Moscow Province.*

**IS REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PRIEST AS INTERMEDIARY?**

**– Father Valerian, how would you explain to a church-newcomer what confession is and why it is necessary?**

– Once a professor at a theological academy gave my father--also a priest--this question during an exam: “Tell me, young batiushka^(\[2\]), (and my father was already in his fifties; he was 49 when he entered the seminary), what does God do when he wants to bring someone to Himself? My dad answered this way and that, and the old professor agreed. Yet towards the end, to get at the heart of the matter, he asked, “And what is the most important?” He himself answered, “He sends a person spiritual heaviness and sorrow of soul, so that the person will seek God, so that he will realize that he cannot be delivered from that condition by any earthly means.” And I think this is very true! During his life, a person constantly and inescapably runs into the consequences of his sins. There is a saying, “Live in such a way during the day, so that at night your conscience won’t bite.” This is an expression of folk wisdom: it is certainly true that one’s sleep is disturbed by impressions of what one did, said, or saw during the day. It seems that everything has gone without problems, but then one begins to ponder on some incident or other, and hears a certain voice saying something to him--the voice of conscience. Sometimes a person, seeing that what he has done is irrevocable, takes a terrible step: he decides to “deliver” himself from this earthly life, or he begins to drink. And thus a person falls into a state even more ruinous than that from which he is fleeing. All of this is but anesthesia; the person can’t cure the disease, but he gets rid of the symptoms, or at least numbs himself to them. Searching for a way out of this pain of soul also brings him to see his need for repentance and forgiveness, one of the basic causes compelling a person to go to Church and confession.

**– It is often asked, “Why does a person have to go to church and confess before a priest? What’s wrong with repenting alone, by yourself, before God--at home, for example--without an intermediary?**

– If confession in a church isn’t possible for some reason, then it ***is*** possible to confess this way, without an intermediary. But can a neophyte hear when God says, “Very good, I forgive you?” Saint John of Kronstadt, when he sinned in some way, would pray until he received forgiveness and spiritual healingfrom God. But does a neophyte have such a degree of communication with God?

People have a natural need for personal contact. But both in relations with another person and in relations with God, it is very important not only to be understood, but also to have a visible sign that God or the other person understands you. The Lord established it thus, that a person receive His forgiveness through another person: a priest. *Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained* (John 20:23).

**– When a person comes to confession, sometimes the question arises: What kind of things specifically should a person confess? Our conscience doesn’t seem to bother us, doesn’t accuse us of anything; we didn’t kill anyone, didn’t rob anyone.**

– Yes, the conscience accuses a person first of the serious sins. But if the conscience doesn’t say anything, often that is because the conscience has opened its mouth before, but the person stopped it up. The holy fathers say that if a person goes from sunlight into a dark room, he begins first to see big objects, then smaller; if he lights a light, then he begins to see everything. In the same way, a person who begins to keep track of his inner life at first sees only the big sins, then the smaller. Then grace gives him light so that he can see his own sins, for this is what we ask God during Great Lent through the prayer of Saint Ephraim the Syrian.

Specifically of *what* sins one should repent is a question of time. At first a person doesn’t understand or notice very much. But during the sacrament itself … ***grace***, the spirit of God, begins to open up a person’s ability to see his sins. And the person, perhaps not even realizing specifically how he has sinned, all the same **feels** his sinfulness. Although the confession of sins includes the idea of comprehension;there is also a state of feeling when a person realizes simply that he is sinful in comparison to holiness; and this also is the action of grace. For example…

My father was born in 1900, so the post-revolutionary years came during his youth. There were all these new currents of thought, this breath of “freedom” … and so he drifted away from the Church. His mother, my grandmother, asked him during Lent if he wouldn’t go to Church and take Holy Communion. She said, “If you do, I’ll bow down at your feet.” “Oh Mama, you don’t have to do that, I’ll just go,” he answered, and went to the church on the Arbat, to Father Vladimir Vorobiev (the grandfather of Archpriest Vladimir Vorobiev, the current rector of St Tikhon’s Orthodox University). He got in line for confession and had not a single thought about repentance; he just stood there and looked at the pretty girls. When his turn came, he knelt down, and to the priest’s question, “Well, young fella, what do you want to say?” my papa answered, “I don’t have anything to say.” “And why did you come?” “My mama asked me to.” The priest was silent for a little while, and then answered, “That’s very good, that you listened to your mama.” He covered my father with his epitrachelion^(\[3\]) and began to read the prayer of forgiveness. “What happened to me next, I don’t understand to this day,” my father told me later. “I began to sob; tears came out of my eyes as if from a spigot. And when I got up and returned to my place in the church, I didn’t look at anyone, anyone at all. The world had become completely different for me.” From that time on, my father began to go to Church. Then by the Providence of God, he was sent to prison, where he was in the same prison cell with holy confessors of the faith. After prison he became a clergyman.

**THE SINS WHICH WE SEE MOST OFTEN IN OTHERS ARE ALSO IN US**

**– Are there any aids to help prepare for confession?**

– One could advise a person to read something written for this purpose; there is a good book by Father John Krestiankin, “Experience in Preparing for Confession”^(\[4\]), and some other material; but here we find a complication: there have appeared some enumerations or lists of sins in which we find a certain “relishing” or “savoring” of the sins. And one must be very careful with such lists, since they sometimes function like a kind of textbook of sin, or manual of sins; because there are listed there such sins that a person not only never did but never even thought of. One should not read a list detailing the sins of the flesh, because it soils the soul. As for the other kinds of sin, it’s better simply to pay attention to your inner state. For example, when we see a weakness in someone, the very fact that we notice that weakness means that that sin is also in us. You remember the “mote” in someone else’s eye and the “beam” in your own? What is it, this mote? A mote grows into a log, and a log is a passion. The mote is a sin; that is, a concrete manifestation of that passion. But if we do not know what kind of tree it is, or what kind of log, if we don’t even know that they are harmful, then we will never suspect what the mote is all about. As it is now expressed, “Everyone understands things according to the degree of his depravity.” And so we notice in another person specifically that sin, we *understand* specifically that passion, which is *in us ourselves*.

**– Some people are disturbed that forgiveness, it turns out, is so easy to receive. A person sins, then repents, then sins again, then repents … and over and over? Without any repentance?**

– Why do you say that? Who told you such a thing? At confession, sin is forgiven; but even so, a person still has to bear the consequences of his sin. The classic example is the repentant thief who was crucified on the cross beside Christ. He repented, and the Lord said to him, *Today you will be with Me in Paradise*. Nothing unclean can enter into Paradise, so we know that the Lord has already purified him and forgiven him his sins; nevertheless, he remained hanging on the cross! And if that weren’t enough, the Gospel tells us that the soldiers then broke his legs (cf. John 19:32). A person all the same has to bear consequences for his sins, although certainly not to the degree he deserves to suffer.

**– Many Christians, although they confess every week, nevertheless remain sinners, in no visible way differing from everyone else. Furthermore, they repent over and over again of the very same sins. It turns out, does it, that confession hasn’t helped them?**

– Nothing of the sort. He who constantly labors over himself already differs from other people. Regarding the very same sins, even the Apostle Paul was given a *thorn in the flesh*, some kind of pain, suffering, or trial, so that he would not get puffed up. As they say, “Until the last breath, even up to the gates of Paradise, the battle with sin goes on.” St Mary of Egypt repented, but for another 17 years she struggled fiercely with sin!

**– Is it necessary to have a feeling of repentance during confession? Some people simply list their sins without any visible emotion. Is this also okay?**

– The importance of the struggle with a sin is not simply that a person names it, but that the sin becomes disgusting and repulsive to him or her. When we were on Mount Athos, a priest asked one of the spiritual fathers, “Why does it happen that we repent, have Holy Communion, and then go out and commit the same sins again?” The elder answered, “It is simply because pain of heart has not yet outweighed and overpowered the sin!”

If you simply enumerate sins, with no pain of heart, that means that you don’t have an inner battle with sin. Repentance obviously includes acquiring an inner feeling of repentance. And this feeling is from God—you can’t give orders to your heart. But sometimes, simply naming your sin at confession is a labor unto blood.

Confession is only the *beginning* of repentance; repentance is the backbone of one’s whole spiritual life. Regarding the prayer which the priest reads at confession (the priest usually reads the beginning of the prayer at the start to everyone together, but the end of the prayer to each person *individually).* “I forgive and remit…” Thus begins the concluding part, and includes the words, “…give him/her (the person confessing, whose sins are being remitted by this prayer) the image of repentance.” What was before that, you ask? He or she has clearly already repented, yet we priests immediately read, “…give him/her the image of repentance!” This is in order to show clearly that immediately after our confession, a new level of repentance begins.

Do you remember how the Apostle Peter in the Gospel fell at the feet of the Saviour and said, *Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord* (Luke 5:8)? This too is a repentant state, which my father also experienced that time when he felt the grace of God!

**– When some people come to the Church, they totally change their lives after their first confession. Some, on the contrary, hardly change at all, continuing to live in their sins as before. On what does this depend?**

– It depends on one’s determination, one’s resolve. One needs to ask for God’s help, for firm resolve, and also for patience. About 40 years ago we were talking with Father John Krestiankin (he was still young then), and he asked if I had read these words of the Apostle James: *If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God* (James 1:5). He asked me, “What kind of wisdom do you think this is? The wisdom of Solomon? No, it is *patience*!” Patience is a spiritual art, a spiritual science. And ***through*** ***patience*** a person can truly be delivered from sin.

**– Sometimes after confession there comes a feeling of spiritual relief or lightness of soul, and sometimes not. What does this mean? Should one expect such a feeling after every confession?**

– If there is such a feeling, glory be to God. But one should not expect it, or wait for it. It will not necessarily appear; and if it doesn’t, that means that one should keep working, that in the battle with sin one can never relax. In general, one should not expect spiritual states, and certainly not seek them. If such states are granted—good; but one shouldn’t expect them. Actually *seeking* or pursuing such spiritual or emotional states is categorically forbidden. If you do not feel spiritual lightness or emotional relief after confession, that does *not* mean that God has not accepted your confession. One of the incidents of the holy fathers goes like this: A certain man repented all the time, genuinely, but all the same was still not delivered from a feeling of heaviness; the fathers of the monastery began to pray for him, “O Lord, he repents so sincerely; why have You not yet forgiven him?” And the answer came, “I forgave him long ago, but this suffering is necessary for his salvation.”

**– How much detail should a person go into when describing his sins at confession? Is it enough to simply list them, or is it necessary to tell the priest in detail??**

– Unfortunately, if each person described everything in detail, confession might last till evening. Sins of the flesh, in particular, should not be told in detail. Also regarding this kind of sin: when a person explains about the circumstances, in my experience, there is often an element of self-justification. Other people sometimes start to retell their whole workday; they have brought me at times entire notebooks. If you start to describe what you have done over the last week or month, then you end up with a whole novel!

The most important thing is not the details but the struggle: if one has named a sin, he should also wrestle with it. If there is not a real battle with sin, then all the details in the world won’t help.

*Protopriest Valerian Kr***e***chetov was born in 1937 into the family of the repressed**^(\[5\])* *accountant and afterwards priest Michael Krechetov. The future Father Valerian graduated from high school in 1959 and then was accepted at the Moscow Forestry-Engineering Institute. Three years after graduation, he followed the example of his father and entered Moscow Seminary. He was ordained a priest on January 12, 1969, and in 1973 graduated from Moscow Theological Academy. During his long years of service as a priest he was able to get to know many outstanding pastors, including Father Nicholas Golubtsov, Father John Krestiankin and Father Nicholas Guryanov. At present, he is the senior father-confessor of the Moscow Diocese and head priest of the Church of the Protection in the village of Akulovo, Odintsovski District.*

^(\[1\])father-confessor (*dukhovnik* in Russian): in this context, the meaning is not simply “spiritual father”, but an experienced spiritual father and priest who has been granted by his bishop the right to confess other priests in that diocese; these confessions customarily take place during a fasting period such as Lent.

^(\[2\])**Batiushka:** an endearing term for a priest or monk; and respectful, old-fashioned word for one’s father. Accented on the first syllable: “b***a***tiushka.”

^(\[3\])**Epitrachelion**: a vestment which hangs as a stole from the neck of a priest, and is placed on the penitent’s head when the prayer of absolution is said; it is the one indispensable vestment for all priestly ministrations.

^(\[4\])In Russian this book is entitled *Opyt Postroenia Ispovedi*, the printed version of a series of talks given at Pskov Caves Monastery during Great Lent to help people prepare for confession.

^(\[5\])**repressed** (in Russian *repressirovanni*): a victim of political repression; this usually includes years of suffering in a concentration camp.

Help with OEC Diamond,Diamonds,1i9vb7i,2025-01-25 14:49:23,1,1.0,3,https://v.redd.it/u7xiadmd27fe1,Sea-Duty4705,Question About Natural Diamonds,"
Hi! I’m a first time poster, making her debut to ask for some much-needed help with diamond selection. 

We are debating if we buy a loose stone or go full in-house with Frank darling. In our trying on, I’ve found that I love a warm OEC, with a large cutlet and would prefer around 2 carats. My fingers are small - I was measured at a 2.75 (but not sure if it matters here haha - although more may be helpful? Who knows!!)

I have narrowed it down to two diamonds:

1. 2.01c from Frank darling
Color: M
Clarity: VVS2
Table depth: 59.3%
Table: 52%
Cost: $9,600 
GIA certificate: https://www.gia.edu/report-check-landing?reportno=1236482224&locale=en_US
Video: https://share.diamondselections.com/d#/diamondv360player/21409_166807078_20

2. 2.13c loose stone  
Color: O to P
Clarity: VS1
Table depth: 57.5%
Table: 52%
GIA certificate: https://www.gia.edu/report-check-landing?reportno=2231142418&locale=en_US
Video: attached 
Cost: $7,500

I would love to know, which diamond is a better “value” for what I’m looking for. If we went with the loose stone, I would probably take it and set it with a local jeweler (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area so I’m taking suggestions too!!) 

There is benefit to going with frank darling with everything in house, and me being a not-so-trained eye for diamonds. I have started the process of creating settings, and so I’m liking how the customer service and experience is with that. I just don’t know if the added cost is justified, even though it is a better diamond. Would I be able to tell a significant difference to justify $2k? 

Our total budget is 15k, but I would really like to keep it around $12k if possible. I considered lab diamonds, but my partner has been really supportive of my desire for a warmer diamond, which seems to only be possible with natural diamonds - plus I do love the romance of an antique diamond. Something about it, maybe I’m sold on marketing 😬

Please give me any thoughts on which diamond to go for, and what to do. Would love to get input. "

* Select the **Post Name** option for a cleaner URL structure (e.g., [www.yourwebsite.com/sample-post](http://www.yourwebsite.com/sample-post)).

# 3. Install an SEO Plugin

SEO plugins simplify the process of optimising your site. They provide tools to manage meta descriptions, titles, XML sitemaps, and more.

Recommended SEO Plugins:

* [Yoast SEO](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/yoast): Offers comprehensive tools for on-page SEO.
* [Rank Math](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/rank-math): A lightweight plugin with advanced features like schema markup and keyword analysis.
* [All in One SEO Pack](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/aioseo): Great for beginners and advanced users alike.

# 4. Conduct Keyword Research

Keyword research helps you understand what your audience is searching for and ensures your content aligns with their needs.

* Tools for Keyword Research:
   * [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/tools/keyword-planner/)
   * [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)
   * [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/)
   * [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)
* Focus on **long-tail keywords** with lower competition for better chances of ranking.

# 5. Optimise Your Titles and Meta Descriptions

Meta titles and descriptions appear in search engine results and influence click-through rates.

**Best Practices**:

* Include your primary keyword in the title and meta description.
* Keep the title under 60 characters and meta description under 160 characters.
* Make your meta descriptions compelling and actionable.

**Example**:

* Title: *“The Ultimate WordPress SEO Guide for 2025”*
* Meta Description: *“Learn proven strategies to optimise your WordPress website for SEO in 2025. Boost rankings, traffic, and conversions today!”*

# 6. Use Heading Tags Strategically

Heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) structure your content and improve readability for both users and search engines.

* Use **one H1 tag** per page (usually the title of the post).
* Break up content with H2 and H3 tags for subheadings.
* Include keywords naturally in your headings.

# 7. Optimise Images for SEO

Images are essential for engagement but can slow down your site if not optimised. Proper image optimisation improves load times and enhances SEO.

**Best Practices**:

* Compress images using tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or plugins like [Smush](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/).
* Use descriptive filenames (e.g., seo-checklist-2025.jpg).
* [Add alt text to images](https://dcpweb.co.uk/blog/what-are-alt-tags-and-why-are-they-important-for-website-seo), including relevant keywords.

# 8. Leverage Internal Linking

Internal links connect your content, making it easier for users and search engines to navigate your site.

* Link to relevant posts and pages within your content.
* Use descriptive anchor text that includes keywords (e.g., “Learn more about \[WordPress SEO tips\].”).
* Avoid overloading pages with too many internal links.

# 9. Create a Sitemap and Submit it to Search Engines

An XML sitemap helps search engines crawl and index your site efficiently.

* Use your SEO plugin (e.g., Yoast SEO or Rank Math) to generate a sitemap automatically.
* Submit your sitemap to search engines:
   * Google: Use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
   * Bing: Use [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/home-05a5a164).

# 10. Enable Gzip Compression and Browser Caching

Faster websites rank better and provide a superior user experience. Gzip compression and browser caching reduce file sizes and load times.

* Install plugins like [WP Rocket](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/wp-rocket) or [W3 Total Cache](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/w3-total-cache) to enable these features.
* Test your site speed using tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) or [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/).

# 11. Secure Your Website with HTTPS

Search engines prioritise secure websites. Installing an [SSL certificate](https://dcpweb.co.uk/blog/ssl-certificate-unlocking-secure-connections-online) ensures your site uses HTTPS, which is critical for both SEO and user trust.

* Most hosting providers offer free SSL certificates.
* Verify your SSL installation using tools like **Why No Padlock?**.

# 12. Write High-Quality, Engaging Content

Content remains king in SEO. Search engines favour websites that provide value to users.

* Focus on creating **long-form, in-depth articles** (1,000+ words) for competitive topics.
* Address your audience’s pain points and provide actionable solutions.
* Update older content regularly to keep it fresh and relevant.

# 13. Enable Mobile Responsiveness

With mobile-first indexing, Google ranks mobile-friendly sites higher. Ensure your site works seamlessly on all devices.

* Test your website using Google’s **Mobile-Friendly Test**.
* Use responsive themes and optimise media for smaller screens.

# 14. Use Schema Markup

Schema markup enhances your site’s appearance in search results by adding rich snippets (e.g., star ratings, FAQs, and product details).

* Add schema markup using plugins like [Schema Pro](https://wpschema.com/) or [Rank Math](https://rankmath.com/).
* Test your structured data using Google’s [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).

# 15. Improve Website Load Times

Slow websites lead to higher bounce rates and lower rankings. Optimising for speed is critical in 2025.

**Key Strategies**:

* Use a caching plugin (e.g., WP Rocket).
* Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files using [Autoptimize](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/autoptimize).
* Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like [Cloudflare](https://dcpweb.co.uk/go/cloudflare).

# 16. Optimise for Local SEO

If your business serves a specific geographic area, local SEO is essential.

* Set up and optimise your [Google My Business](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VFiaM2rHAj9yWWWW6) profile.
* Include local keywords in your content (e.g., “best café in London”).
* Add your address, phone number, and operating hours to your website.

# 17. Monitor and Fix Broken Links

Broken links frustrate users and can harm SEO.

* Use plugins like [Broken Link Checker](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/) to identify and fix broken links.
* Regularly audit your website for outdated or incorrect links.

# 18. Integrate Social Media Sharing

Social signals may not directly impact SEO, but they drive traffic and increase brand visibility.

* Use plugins like [Social Warfare](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/social-warfare/) or [AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/) to add social sharing buttons.
* Encourage visitors to share your content on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

# 19. Monitor Website Analytics

Tracking your website’s performance helps identify areas for improvement.

* Use [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) to monitor traffic, bounce rates, and user behaviour.
* Combine with [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to track keyword rankings and indexation issues.

# 20. Keep Your Website Updated

Regular updates ensure your WordPress core, themes, and plugins are secure and compatible with the latest SEO standards.

* Enable automatic updates where possible.
* Use a staging site to test updates before applying them to your live site.

Any ideas on why this Excel file is unable to save on a specific computer?,PowerShell,1i9v7h7,2025-01-25 14:44:45,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/1i9v7h7/any_ideas_on_why_this_excel_file_is_unable_to/,Intergalactic201,Question,"Hi all I created some code for work which basically creates an excel file, uses rest-api to grab data from our ticketing system, then manipulates that data into the excel file before saving. The code has worked with no issues on all my coworkers computers except for one. For some reason when the command to save the file runs she gets the following error (edited out our folder path)

>Microsoft Excel cannot access the file '\[correct file location\]\\26308000'. There are several possible reasons:

>• The file name or path does not exist.

>• The file is being used by another program.

For some reason it tries to access that random alphanumeric file, which changes each time she runs the script, instead of what should be the hardcoded file ""Utilization\_Report.xlsx"". Some things to note is that she uses a Windows 365 cloud PC while everyone else uses their physical laptop, but I've tested it on a cloud PC and couldn't recreate the issue. Also the file is being saved in Egnyte if that changes anything. 

Here is the relevant code: 

    Add-Type -AssemblyName Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel
    $xlFixedFormat = [Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlFileFormat]::xlWorkbookDefault
    $excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application

    $excel.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs($importFile, $xlFixedFormat)
    Start-Sleep -S 2 
    $excel.Quit()
    $excel = $null

  
I've tried numerous attempts to recreate this issue, including running it with the file open already, but so far have not been able to recreate the strange alphanumeric naming scheme. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

Defense Health Agency Announces TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver,navy,1i9v3w4,2025-01-25 14:40:19,7,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1i9v3w4/defense_health_agency_announces_tricare_west/,OGPeakyblinders,NEWS,"News | Jan. 25, 2025
Defense Health Agency Announces TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver
By TRICARE Communications

FALLS CHURCH, Va.  –  Are you enrolled in TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has waived the requirement to obtain pre-authorization for referrals to outpatient specialty care for TRICARE Prime enrollees in the West region. This means TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care. However, you’ll still need to get a referral from your Primary Care Manager before getting that specialty care.
This process will be in place through March 31 and is retroactive to January 1, 2025.

“TriWest’s referrals portal has experienced issues that have affected the processing of new referrals,” explained Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject matter expert, TRICARE Health Plan, at the DHA. “If you have TRICARE Prime and are in the West region, this waiver will allow you to access specialty services without interruption to your care.”

This waiver doesn’t apply to:

Inpatient care
Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services
Laboratory developed tests
Extended Care Health Option services
If you need any of these four services above, TriWest will still need to pre-authorize your referral before you see your specialist.

Getting outpatient specialty care during the waiver period
During this waiver period, you should follow the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan, as described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook. You can continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care—even if your PCM is not currently in TriWest’s network.
So, what’s different?

Through March 31, you don’t have to wait for TriWest to process your referral to seek care. You should ask your PCM for a copy of your referral.
You can ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist. You can also see a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re a TRICARE-authorized provider. You can also search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.
When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through March 31. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter, available on www.tricare.mil/west.
Note: If you see a civilian PCM, they may also be able to send your referral to your specialist electronically. But you should request and keep a copy for your records.

The process for getting specialty care within a military hospital or clinic hasn’t changed.

Not sure if your PCM or specialist is in the TRICARE network? If your provider is no longer a TRICARE network provider, you can keep seeing them and pay TRICARE Prime copayments. However, they must be TRICARE-authorized. This means they’re:

Licensed by a state, accredited by national organization, or meet other standards of the medical community
Certified to provide benefits under TRICARE
They don’t have to be in the TRICARE network but make sure to ask the provider if they’re TRICARE-authorized before getting care.

Starting April 1, if the provider is still a non-network provider and isn’t named on your pre-authorization, you’ll need to pay point-of-service fees.

Starting April 1, you’ll need a referral from your PCM approved by TriWest to see a specialist.

Referrals and authorizations issued before Jan. 1, 2025
Do you have an unexpired referral or authorization dated before Jan. 1, 2025? TriWest will accept all unexpired referrals and authorizations approved by the previous contractor (Humana Military or HNFS). These will be accepted through their expiration date, or June 30, 2025, whichever comes first. Your PCM doesn’t need to take additional action to get these approved again.

Do you have questions about referrals, authorizations, or other parts of the West Region transition? Check out TRICARE West Region Transition to learn whom to contact with your questions.

Banking Giant Morgan Stanley Open to Offering Crypto Services in 'Safe Way': CEO,bitfate,1i9v28u,2025-01-25 14:38:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9v28u/banking_giant_morgan_stanley_open_to_offering/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨Just IN: Morgan Stanley Dives into Crypto Waters

In a significant move, Morgan Stanley's CEO, Ted Pick, has announced that the bank is exploring ways to offer crypto services in the US. This development marks a notable shift in the traditional financial sector's approach to cryptocurrency.

Pick emphasized the importance of collaborating with regulators to ensure these services are provided safely. He mentioned that Morgan Stanley will be working closely with the US Treasury and other regulatory authorities to navigate the complex landscape of crypto regulations.

This isn't Morgan Stanley's first foray into crypto; back in 2021, the bank allowed its asset management clients to invest in Bitcoin funds. Now, with its crypto subsidiary E-Trade preparing to launch spot crypto trading services, the bank is further solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency market.

The move is part of a broader trend where traditional financial institutions (TradFi) are increasingly interested in the crypto space. Other major players like Charles Schwab are also considering entry into the spot crypto market, pending favorable regulatory conditions.

Pick's optimism about the sustainability of cryptocurrencies is clear, as he believes that the longer crypto trading continues, the more it will become a mainstream reality. This positive outlook is a promising sign for the future of digital assets.

Meanwhile, the recent surge in memecoins, such as those related to the Trump family, has attracted new retail investors, with many buying these coins for the first time. This influx of new money into the crypto market highlights the diverse and dynamic nature of the space.

Deeming certain conduct of members of Antifa as domestic terrorism and 
        designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.

_______________________________________________________________________


                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 9, 2025

 Ms. Greene of Georgia (for herself, Mr. Biggs of Arizona, Mrs. Miller 
  of Illinois, Mr. Higgins of Louisiana, and Mr. Hunt) submitted the 
   following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the 
                               Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION

 
Deeming certain conduct of members of Antifa as domestic terrorism and 
        designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.

Whereas the extremist organization Antifa is motivated by communism, anarchism, 
        socialism, and violence, and has continuously demonstrated their 
        commitment to lawlessness and criminal behavior;
Whereas, in 2016, the Department of Homeland Security formally classified Antifa 
        activities as ``domestic terrorist violence'';
Whereas one chapter, Rose City Antifa, has rejected the civil treatment of 
        perceived enemies, stating, ``We can't just argue against them; we have 
        to prevent them from organizing by any means necessary.'', and this same 
        chapter publicly stated, ``We are unapologetic about the reality that 
        fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy.'';
Whereas the far-left militant organization held signs reading, ``We are 
        ungovernable'' and ``Abolish ICE, no cops, prisons, borders, 
        presidents'', illustrating their dedication to lawlessness;
Whereas, in response to the 2017 violent riots, an Antifa extremist stated, 
        ``Sometimes you have to use direct action to stop it because protesting, 
        signs, yelling is not going to do anything. You have to make them 
        afraid.'';
Whereas Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray stated in a 
        testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee, ``We have seen folks 
        who subscribe or identify with the Antifa movement, who coalesce 
        regionally into small groups or nodes and they are certainly organized 
        at that level'', proving these extreme, violent attacks, disguised under 
        the name of protests, are coordinated, organized events that are 
        orchestrated by Antifa;
Whereas the Congressional Research Service reports that Antifa literature urges 
        followers to publicize information such as home addresses, phone 
        numbers, photographs, and social media profiles of perceived enemies;
Whereas, in June 2018, at least 1,500 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        (referred to in this resolution as ``ICE'') employees were doxed by an 
        Antifa-linked Twitter account and were subjected to violent threats and 
        harassments;
Whereas, in February 2017, black-bloc, Antifa-affiliated riots resulted in 
        $100,000 worth of damage at the University of California at Berkeley;
Whereas, in February 2017, over 200 rioters were indicted on charges of 
        assaulting police officers, torching a limousine, and smashing windows 
        of several businesses, and other Antifa-affiliated rioters were armed 
        with hammers, crowbars, bricks, rocks, flares, firecrackers, and other 
        explosive devices;
Whereas, in August 2017, approximately 100 Antifa rioters incited violence 
        during a peaceful rally in Berkeley, California, where these terrorists 
        were repeatedly punching and kicking innocent people, sending several 
        peaceful protestors to the hospital, and ultimately 13 rioters were 
        arrested on a range of charges including assault with deadly weapons and 
        obstructing a police officer;
Whereas, in July 2020, a self-proclaimed member of Antifa, Willem Van Spronsen, 
        tossed lit objects at vehicles and buildings, caused a car fire, 
        attempted to ignite a 500-gallon propane tank, and attempted to firebomb 
        the ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington;
Whereas, in February 2021, the United States Attorney for the District of Oregon 
        stated that Antifa caused more than $2,300,000 in riot damage to Federal 
        property in Oregon, not including any damages to private businesses or 
        State, county, and city buildings;
Whereas, over the summer of 2020, Antifa assisted in inflicting over 
        $2,000,000,000 in damages against churches, Federal buildings, 
        businesses, and other downtown structures across 20 States, resulting in 
        the death of at least 30 individuals as well as 700 injured police 
        officers;
Whereas, over the summer and fall of 2020, Portland District Attorney Mike 
        Schmidt refused to file charges in approximately 70 percent of the 
        approximate 1,000 protest- and riot-related cases brought by police 
        officers;
Whereas, in May 2020, the Department of Justice formally labeled Antifa violence 
        as domestic terrorism in a public statement saying, ``The violence 
        instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in 
        connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated 
        accordingly.'';
Whereas Black Lives Matter-Antifa rioter Malik Fard Muhammad was sentenced to 10 
        years in Federal prison for ``repeatedly and intentionally jeopardizing 
        the lives of police officers, destroying public property, and 
        encouraging others to commit violence during protests that occurred in 
        Portland in 2020'';
Whereas, in January 2021, Portland Police Bureau officials reported that Antifa 
        rioters attacked officers in downtown Portland shooting commercial-
        grade, aerial fireworks and firebombs, and destroying government 
        property and over a dozen downtown businesses;
Whereas in that same riot, police were also attacked with bricks, rocks, and 
        frozen water bottles, and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler reported at least 
        tens of thousands of dollars in damage had been done;
Whereas, in August 2022, Antifa ardently defended the sexualization of children 
        by guarding a ``kid-friendly'' drag show at a North Texas distillery;
Whereas, in January 2023, Atlanta police arrested 6 extremists on charges of 
        domestic terrorism following violent riots carried out by members of 
        Antifa who shattered windows, destroyed businesses, torched a police 
        car, and vandalized the walls of the city;
Whereas, in January 2023, Antifa issued a statement telling its followers to 
        bring pipes, spray paint, kerosene, and lighters to New York City to 
        ``Burn it all down'';
Whereas, in March 2023, Antifa-affiliated rioters set fire to the future Atlanta 
        police training facility by launching fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and 
        other destructive items at police officers and into the facility's 
        construction site resulting in arrests of 23 extremists on charges of 
        domestic terrorism;
Whereas these coordinated, destructive acts of hate carried out by Antifa are 
        attacks against the Nation's law enforcement as well as the American 
        people and have no place in the United States; and
Whereas members of Antifa are relentlessly dedicated to using acts of domestic 
        terrorism in order to suppress opposing political ideologies: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) this conduct of Antifa members, or any unlawful conduct 
        performed at an Antifa-affiliated demonstration, is deemed to 
        be domestic terrorism (as such term is defined in section 2331 
        of title 18, United States Code);
            (2) the House of Representatives designates Antifa, and any 
        other affiliated group or subsidiary of Antifa, to be a 
        domestic terrorist organization; and
            (3) the House of Representatives calls on the Department of 
        Justice--
                    (A) to prosecute these crimes of domestic terrorism 
                (as such term is defined in section 2331 of title 18,

"At Gracepoint Ministries, ‘Whole-Life Discipleship’ Took Its Toll",GracepointChurch,1i9uwx4,2025-01-25 14:31:54,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/1i9uwx4/at_gracepoint_ministries_wholelife_discipleship/,hamcycle,,"by Curtis Yee

*As the predominantly Asian American church network expands to dozens of college towns, former members come forward with claims of spiritual abuse.*

*Update (August 15, 2023): Gracepoint Ministries, formerly Gracepoint Church,* [*has rebranded*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/about/our-story) *as Acts2 Network. The group’s website states that “the scope of our ministries is such that our original local church’s name no longer adequately captures who we are.” The church's highly coordinated top-down organization structure will shift to a more “locally-led, centrally-supported model” while still maintaining its “core DNA.”*

*The ministry has also clarified expectations around its “*[*Way of Life*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/way-of-life)*,” which includes a “default position of support” for leaders and adopting a “common calendar.” Noting that Pastor Ed Kang and his wife, Kelly, are now in their 60s, the ministry says it is “restructuring to prepare for a future transition to the next generation of leaders.”*

Gracepoint Church checks all the boxes of a college ministry success story.

Founded in 1981 around the concept of whole-life discipleship, the church—then known as Berkland Baptist—established itself as a home for Asian American students attending the University of California, Berkeley. With the mission to plant “an Acts 2 church in every college town,” Gracepoint stands out among [the loose network](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://nyupress.org/9780814747902/gods-new-whiz-kids/) of predominantly Asian American college churches that pepper campuses across the West Coast and beyond.

Located on over 60 campuses, it has launched church plants in 35 cities nationwide, as well as one in Taiwan, with 15 new churches planted in 2021 alone.

At campus clubs like Klesis and Acts2Fellowship, Gracepoint pushes college students to wrestle with tough questions and pursue church mentorship. At graduation, it encourages young Christians to live life on mission by joining staff at one of its campuses or helping launch a new one. Staying at Gracepoint has a strong appeal, echoing the coming-of-age films that ask, *Why can’t college last forever?*

“I guess you could say we were just a bunch of people who enjoyed college life so much that we never left it,” the church quips in a [promotional video](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlbN8MtjN4&feature=youtu.be).

“I think people experience a spiritual vibrancy and potency and just a warmth and depth of relationship with God that they haven’t experienced elsewhere,” said Michael Kim, a member at the church’s Santa Barbara campus who was raised at Gracepoint. “For serving members, it’s high pressure, high labor, high toil, but high gratification.”

[https://www.facebook.com/gracepointchurches/posts/pfbid02GdF6JpQmHiay2dxNNsrqKQiG2iwZfz2JeydHBKho9k8t1o7PtujUKeftePFcXkRHl](https://www.facebook.com/gracepointchurches/posts/pfbid02GdF6JpQmHiay2dxNNsrqKQiG2iwZfz2JeydHBKho9k8t1o7PtujUKeftePFcXkRHl)

But many who were involved in Gracepoint say the church’s desire to pursue radical living, coupled with the pace of its ministry, has come at a cost—its members.

“They do good, but the process in which they enforce that good is spiritually abusive,” said Joshua Mun, a former member who grew up attending the Berkeley church and served at various Gracepoint church plants throughout his 20s.

Thirty-two former Gracepoint members who spoke with *Christianity Today* for this story described a culture that was “controlling” and “coercive” for the sake of ministry efficiency.

Members said they were manipulated into confessing sins, screamed at by leaders, and overloaded with obligations to the point of illness. To keep members focused on mission work, Gracepoint effectively restricted dating, media consumption, and pet ownership. Leaders directed staff on how to arrange their homes, where to shop for clothes, and what cars to drive.

“My leader’s words were like the words of God,” said Mun, who left the church last year due in part to anxiety. “I viewed God as this incredibly sensitive, temperamental, judgmental being. I’m one sin away from him dropping the hammer and smiting me, because that’s what my leaders were representing to me.”

Gracepoint has faced decades of criticism from members who left its ranks, but allegations drew new attention last year on a channel of the message board site [Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/). Posters allege they were [belittled by church leaders](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220226000204/Www.Reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t1h5ao/calling_me_a_dog/), encouraged to [take on credit card debt](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/o2hgo5/credit_card_debt_email/) to fund ministry expenses, and slandered after [choosing to leave the church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/pp7htb/gracepoint_ignores_and_discredits_all_those_who/).

“I am very sorry for those who feel they have experienced harm under our ministry,” wrote Ed Kang, the church’s senior pastor and network leader, in an email response to questions sent by CT. Kang said he would be “eager to hear from them so that we can seek healing, apologize when necessary, and seek reconciliation.”

A regional director for the church, Daniel Kim (no relation to Michael Kim), shared his contact information on the forum, asking those looking for “personal reconciliation” to reach out. He told CT that eight people have contacted him since he first posted in April 2021.

Over the course of CT reporting this article, Gracepoint has begun to rethink aspects of its ministry style and implement reforms. Kang told CT the church is focusing on “dialing down the excellence” in response to internal reflection and public criticism.

“One conclusion was that a lot of our relationships have been disrupted because of our church planting efforts,” Kang said. “We have been too task oriented, trying to do a lot with fewer people and thinned-out relationships.”

Yet even when acknowledging former members’ hurt, leaders have prioritized the [damage they’ve done to Gracepoint’s ministry](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/syzdcr/a_plea_from_gracepoint/) by making their grievances public.

On a [new church podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAkZ0jJ6RkfMZqaJVCqWNA) launched last month, Isaiah Kang, Ed’s son, said anonymous posters are “not messengers from heaven.” He added, “Whatever else may be true—you may be wronged, you probably were wronged—that doesn’t make what you do right.”

While college ministries like InterVarsity and Asian American Christian Fellowship were launching programs to serve a growing wave of Asian immigrants and second-generation Asian Americans, Rebekah and Paul Kim (no relation to the other Kims) [planted a church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/fall-2009-constant-change/new-believers/) to minister to Korean Americans at UC Berkeley in 1981. On the border of Berkeley and Oakland, the church was named Berkland Baptist.

Berkland members bonded as both Christians and Korean Americans, often referring to older church members by Korean honorifics—*hyung* for older brother and *noona* for older sister.

“One of the things that’s good about the Korean culture is that when someone wants you close to them, they make you part of their family,” said a former longtime Berkland member who asked not to be named due to his close ties with Gracepoint leadership. “You’re not just a fellow brother in Christ; you are really my brother. You’re my true family. Those kinds of values were considered essential as part of the church.”

That familial attitude tied into the church’s model of whole-life discipleship. Like many college ministries where young adults commit to codes of conduct, accountability, and community obligations, Berkland attracted Asian American students with its strict but tight-knit ministry philosophy.

They joined the church, paired with disciplers for mentorship, fervently studied Scripture, and evangelized on their campuses, seeing more added to the church. (Because of the church’s focus on college ministry, leaders discouraged members from inviting coworkers or neighbors who were out of college.)

By getting involved in Berkland, and later Gracepoint, students were expected to forgo the typical liberties associated with college life. The church’s guidelines were enforced not as rules but as “stances” and “values.”

Undergraduate students were discouraged from dating and, in some cases, forced to break up. (The church is reconsidering its stance against dating, Kang said.) When disciplers approved of a dating relationship, both parties were still expected to keep it private. Half a dozen former members recalled learning that couples were together only upon receiving wedding invitations.

When they became part of the ministry team, Gracepoint members were required to install internet filtering software like Covenant Eyes on their devices. Leaders could track screen time not just to check for pornography but also to discourage users from listening to K-pop or watching too much ESPN. Kang told CT the church tries to mitigate “the effects of the media-entertainment complex and tech companies” and has historically discouraged the use of televisions and social media.

According to Len Tang, director of the Church Planting Initiative at Fuller Theological Seminary, high-pressure churches like Gracepoint often enforce a “methodological purity” within their ministry.

“A methodological purity might say that college ministry must be done in a specific way. You have to disciple them in a particular way, or you need to isolate them or separate them from certain influences,” Tang said.

Young members were being discipled to follow not only the Bible but also the church’s culture—what was acceptable, what was lauded by their leaders as signs of their devotion. And when they violated those expectations, often unknowingly, the results could be explosive.

Paul Lee said his pastor at UC Riverside called to yell at him for having coffee with a female friend on staff, which he had done before but didn’t know was frowned on. “He jumped so quickly to scolding me, really making sure I was in this posture of shame,” Lee said.

Documents from 2011 taught church leaders to rebuke members “so that the person gets to have proper fear toward God & proper shock over what he has done,” with the trainer modeling screaming and slamming the table, according to former staff. Kang said such rebukes are infrequent and such training couldn’t be used now with the “anxiety and emotional fragility” of today’s generation.

These outbursts shamed members for not following the standards of their community. But what might have felt like conviction from God at the moment they later saw as the leaders’ aggression.

One Thanksgiving, Austin Lee (no relation to Paul) was berated for not tithing enough after moving cross-country to help plant a church at the University of North Carolina without consistent employment. Pastor Richard Tjhen told CT he became “agitated and annoyed” because Austin Lee was defensive during their conversation. Tjhen said that his own actions were “totally inappropriate and not our church policy.”

>""I realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.""

Members under discipline could be asked to refrain from serving in ministries and even attending services. But their restoration hinged on the whims of Gracepoint leaders, with the process sometimes dragging out and involving assignments to repent with written reflections and confessions. Kang said that a “period of withdrawal” from ministry can be appropriate, but the practice of writing reflections has tapered off over the years.

The Berkland network [disbanded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/nkbx1r/eds_letter_to_becky_2005_after_discussion_with/) in 2006, and the Berkeley and Davis churches rebranded as Gracepoint, eventually planting churches in college cities and towns beyond California. Under Kang’s leadership, Gracepoint campuses offered near-identical weekly [programming](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.course101.org/), down to [recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.dishgracepoint.com/) recommendations.

Commitment to church ordered all of life: Tabulated spreadsheets organized staff schedules by the hour, often stretching late into evenings and weekends. Members realized their schedules were no longer their own. They were expected to ask permission to go on vacation or visit their families, former members said.

“I had a strained relationship with my parents,” said Martin Loekito, who was a member of Gracepoint’s Davis church for 14 years. “I could never spend time with them without feeling like I needed to get away, like I needed to be back at church.”

Another former member, Elaine Huang, said church leaders called her “selfish” when she opted to visit her parents in Taiwan the summer after her graduation from UC Berkeley in the early 2010s. Arguing that her parents were already saved and therefore required less of her attention, Huang’s leaders convinced her to cut her months-long trip short to participate in the church’s fall outreach.

For Loekito and others, the church’s warning of idolizing the family carried into married life. Loekito said his eldest daughter spent large portions of her early childhood at the church’s babysitting ministry while he and his wife were participating in events.

“When we left \[the church\], she was a year and a half old, and I kind of felt like it was a lost time,” he said, recollecting on missing his daughter’s first words and steps. “Just having dinner, everyone at the same table—that was very rare.”

Years of “whole-life discipleship” took a toll. Paul Lee, the former Riverside church member, experienced “physically debilitating” stress that caused stomachaches, headaches, and frequent panic attacks. Despite bringing his symptoms to his leaders, he said he was not allowed to step back from most of his church responsibilities.

“I think it was at that point when I realized that \[the church\] really did not care for my well-being,” Lee said. “They cared more that I was staying and being a productive sort of functioning member.”

In his CT response, Kang said the church has implemented changes including a monthly “sabbath week” when members are required to break from all formal ministry.

In an internal survey of 1,004 Gracepoint members late last year, 37 percent viewed the church primarily as a family, 34 percent viewed it as an army, and 29 percent viewed it as a factory.

Whole-life discipleship did in fact extend to every area of life. According to emails from former leaders, members were asked to change their wardrobe (“I think I need to get some odd clothes out of \[this member’s\] closet too so she doesn’t get tempted to keep wearing them.”), dietary habits (“I found out \[that you\] regularly eat late at night. I think you need to really curb that. I have noticed that you are looking more and more unhealthy lately.”), and living spaces (“I was appalled once again to hear that your house has been like a pig sty. … Either your life is out of control or you are extremely lazy or you are extremely selfish.”).

Leaders might recommend specific pieces of home decor (the affordable [Ikea Kallax](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-white-80275887/)) or clothes (modest yet tasteful Ann Taylor and Banana Republic). Members even purchased similar vehicles—the Nissan Quest or Honda Odyssey, affordable minivans that could easily transport students and ministry supplies.

>37% of Gracepoint members viewed the church primarily as a family, 34% viewed it as an army, and 29% viewed it as a factory.

While oversight and granular life advice can be part of college formation and discipleship, Gracepoint’s influence grew more intrusive as members remained at the church. One member who attended Gracepoint Berkeley for 22 years worried that her involvement stunted her maturity.

“One of the things I’m learning now that I’m out \[of the church\] is that I can actually make my own decisions without checking with somebody, asking for permission, being afraid that I’ll get in trouble,” she said. “I know it sounds weird. This is what a 20-year-old would realize, but here I am at 40 just realizing this now.”

Evangelical ministries eager for holistic, 24/7, “all-of-life” discipleship have sometimes crossed boundaries into spiritual abuse, where members feel coerced and manipulated rather than guided and mentored. In 2020, Acts 29 CEO Steve Timmis [was removed from leadership for his level of bullying and control.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/february/acts-29-ceo-steve-timmis-removed-spiritual-abuse-tch.html) The charismatic shepherding movement of the 1970s and ’80s ended with [former leaders disavowing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1990/march-19/shepherding-movement-idea-whose-time-has-gone.html) their own intrusive practices. (Former Berkland members said founder Rebekah Kim was [trained by University Bible Fellowship](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t74d8i/gracepoints_spiritual_heritage_university_bible/), a Korean offshoot of the shepherding movement.)

Six ex-Gracepoint staff said mental breakdowns contributed to their decisions to leave the church and, for some, the faith. Last year, Pete Nguyen left Gracepoint after experiencing severe depression and suicidal thoughts while attending.

Huang, the UC Berkeley student, said a church leader told her that her suicidal thoughts were because she didn’t “love God enough.” She said this response pushed her to walk away from Christianity. The leader, Suzanne Suh, said she did not recall the conversation but “would not talk to someone who is suicidal using this type of approach or using these kinds of words.”

A former UC Santa Barbara student said her declining well-being—depression and an eating disorder relapse—was seen as evidence of her unrepentance after she crossed a physical boundary with her boyfriend. She was asked to write reflections and was repeatedly told that she had not seen the full reality of her sin.

“These constant assessments about me being unrepentant—they didn’t reflect what I was actually thinking and feeling,” said Noelle, who is also an abuse survivor and asked CT not to use her last name due to her job as a teacher. “I realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.”

Online criticism of the church’s high-pressure environment did not start with the Reddit posts. Anonymous blogs including *Twisted Gracepoint* and [*The Truth about Gracepoint Church*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://gracepoint-berkeley.blogspot.com/) circulated online in the 2000s.

Emails obtained by CT show that Gracepoint maintained its own blogs to compete with those critiquing the church. Over the years, church members were told to avoid driving traffic to the online criticism and were instead encouraged to protect the church’s “online reputation.” At times, Gracepoint leaders asked staff and members to search and click on church webpages or positive blog posts at least three times a day to improve Google search rankings.

Church leaders were also encouraged to write positive Yelp reviews—and sometimes report negative ones. Both practices remain, especially in the ramp-up to fall quarter.

Gracepoint’s training documents teach staff to explain why the church’s “hierarchical leadership” is “not authoritarian” or why negative perception of the church’s culture of rebuke is “overblown” due to “an emotionally fragile generation.” Weary of internal programs being leaked, leaders asked members to periodically delete “sensitive” recordings and emails containing talks and trainings or to watch them under supervision.

An FAQ page on Gracepoint’s website answered the question “[Is Gracepoint a Cult?](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220910014212/https://www.gracepointonline.org/is-gracepoint-a-cult)”—“Nope, not really”—while dismissing “Reddit trolls” and touting its Southern Baptist affiliation. (Kang previously sat on the [advisory board](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.gracepointonline.org/partners) for Send Network, the church planting arm of the Southern Baptists’ North American Mission Board. Vance Pitman, the network’s president, has [lauded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca6R5TysA9A/) Kang’s “kingdom leadership.”)

Some critics are taking their concerns offline. Several parents of former and current members, worried that the church is distancing them from their children, have raised concerns about the church’s fellowship groups to leaders at UC campuses and Biola University.

The University of San Francisco revoked the recognition status of Gracepoint’s Klesis fellowship in May 2021 because it “did not meet the requirements to be a USF affiliated ministry, misrepresented its relationship with Gracepoint Church, and continued to have contact with students” following an interim suspension issued in March. Kang confirmed the church no longer operates on the campus, though some students still attend the San Francisco location. He was unsure how the group may have misrepresented itself to the university.

For those who have left, connecting with other former members in person and online has helped their transition out of the church. Loekito, who left in 2019, said that the discussion has allowed him and his wife to process their experience, but reacclimating to a new church has been hard.

“My regrets are mostly about the people that I ministered to when I had no right to be called a minister,” Loekito said. “Some of them left, and I was able to reconnect with them and say I’m sorry for what I did to them. But the worst is those who are still there, young people who I told to defy their parents and throw away their ambitions and throw away their future to join the \[Gracepoint\] cause.”

Some former members said their departures were mischaracterized within the organization, with current attendees saying that those who left did so to “pursue the world” by purchasing pets or getting Disneyland passes.

“It feels like the bridge is being burnt from the other end,” said Mun. “I’m not going to negate the truth that God reached me through Gracepoint, but it doesn’t mean that Gracepoint is God’s heaven on earth.”

Gracepoint continues its evangelism efforts for the fall semester. Rebranding as Gracepoint Ministries, it has expanded Area Youth Ministry, a parachurch organization meant to evangelize middle- and high-school students and supplement church youth groups. The group operates in [24 cities](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.areayouth.org/locations), and according to Kang, Gracepoint staff are now split between college and noncollege ministries.

Nguyen, who left in 2021 after attending Gracepoint for a decade, has spoken at length with his former leaders at the Riverside and Pomona campuses, as well as with Daniel Kim, about the ways he felt wronged.

“If they really examine things, they really could change,” he said, “but I just don’t think they’re willing to let go of a lot of the practices they’ve been holding on to.”

During an April 2021 sermon on one of the Beatitudes, Kang told the church not to be discouraged by their online critics; Jesus himself warned that detractors would “utter all kinds of evil against you falsely” (Matt. 5:11, ESV).

“Clearly people who are posting are either genuinely grieved and wounded or so narcissistic that some small evil or injustice or wrong done to them is something utterly outrageous and they can’t move on,” Kang said.

“One thing that we must not do is be persuaded by criticism that there’s something wrong with us.”

"PSA/Guide: convert apt lists to DEB822 format, use Signed-By",debian,1i9ut57,2025-01-25 14:27:29,6,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1i9ut57/psaguide_convert_apt_lists_to_deb822_format_use/,ScratchHistorical507,,"From the `NEWS.Debian.gz`file found in apt 2.9.24+ currently found in sid, both a missing Signed-By field in sources.list have become deprecated and users should migrate their one-line stile `.list` files to DEB822 `.source` files. Also, /etc/apt/trusted.gpg won't be trusted anymore.

    /etc/apt/trusted.gpg is no longer trusted. Setting the Dir::Etc::trusted
      option manually continues to work for some more time.
    
      sources.list(5) entries without the Signed-By field are deprecated;
      migrate any legacy entries to the deb822 .sources format. See the
      apt-secure(7) manual page for best practices for signer configuration.
      This deprecates the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory.

And since this is likely to become part of Debian 13 when it hits stable, and since I don't know how far that transition will be automated, here a little guide how to handle this transition.

  
First off, the new DEB822 file format may be longer, but it's a lot easier for beginners to understand. Also, it should be easier to add multiple mirrors for the same suite so apt can just use a different one if one can't be reached. More details about the format can be found with [man 5 sources.list](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/apt/sources.list.5.en.html). So converting the default repos that should always be there in `/etc/apt/sources.list` would look like this:

First create a new file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`, e.g. `debian.sources`. The content for stable can look like this:

    X-Repolib-Name: Debian Main
    Enabled: yes
    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian/
    Suites: stable stable-updates stable-backports
    Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
    X-Repolib-ID: system
    Signed-by: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-bookworm-automatic.gpg
    Architectures: amd64
    
    X-Repolib-Name: Debian Security
    Enabled: yes
    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: https://security.debian.org/debian-security/
    Suites: stable
    Components: main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
    X-Repolib-ID: system
    Signed-by: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-bookworm-security-automatic.gpg
    Architectures: amd64

The option URIs can take a space-separated list of mirrors, and one `.sources` file can still hold multiple repos, although it's a lot cleaner to never combine multiple third-party repos into one file. Upon `apt update` both versions will be downloaded. Debian's keys are part of the package `debian-archive-keyring`. And while `apt-key` for handling keys is already removed, as a reminder if you need to get the key for a third party repo and they haven't updated their guide on how to do so without `apt-key`:

`wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-keyring.gpg`"
Why Salary and Retainers Are the Stickiest Income (and How to Break Free),ContentMarketing,1i9urbe,2025-01-25 14:25:16,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentMarketing/comments/1i9urbe/why_salary_and_retainers_are_the_stickiest_income/,themojoway,,"Residual income is nice. Passive income is sweet. But what kind of income do I want most of all?

Chapstick-free income!

[Chapstick-free income](https://preview.redd.it/a2vb5bkww6fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5817139a3cb3d2e1c608bb961b2c2b5a02ffa40d)

What is Chapstick-free income? Low-stress income…

… that comes in like clockwork

…that I don’t have to KISS ASS FOR!

They say that 92% of every dollar in circulation tests positive for cocaine! I believe it. I also imagine 92% of every dollar would also test positive for Chapstick.

Chapstick???

Yes, I was surprised too…

… until I put my own dollars under a microscope.

How many dollars did I have coming in that I didn’t have to pucker up for? How long could I go without “pleasing” a client or boss before I was in a Category 5 income famine? How many hours a day did I spend trying to keep THEM happy instead of keeping my family happy? How much of my calendar was blacked out on client calls? Sales Calls? Only to take on another “master” to “serve” at the expense of my freedom and independence?

I dunno about you?

My bucks were gooky and way too Chapsticky. The most gooped-up bucks are the ones labeled “salary”. The next stickiest are the ones marked “monthly retainer”. Salary and retainer may be income for ME…

But they are an EXPENSE to my client. Which makes me an EXPENSE to my client(s). And what does EVERYONE want to do with an expense? Cut them!!!

or…

Demand more for the expenses. It makes so much sense!

No matter how much work I do…

No matter how awesome my work is…

No matter if my client is getting the results…

They will want MORE, MORE, MORE…

… and if they don’t get it?

…they cut me off!

It’s only a matter of time.

No amount of ass-kissing…

… or extra 1:1

…or bonuses

…will change human nature.

And when the economy gets scary? The expense-cutting axe really falls swiftly. Look at what happened in 2020. Expenses got cut so fast heads spun.

It happened. It’s happening. It will happen again.

But…

I got sick of serving masters…

… on the expense side of the profit and loss statement.

I wanted to call the shots. I wanted to make the rules. I hate blacked-out calendars jammed full of client pleasing BS. I had to pack my bags and make a move…

From the expense side of the P&L

..to the INCOME side.

To break free of income and time famine…

I HAD to become a PAYCHECK to partners…

…instead of an expense to clients

I knew deep down in my soul that this was the answer…

And I was TERRIFIED…

I had bills to pay. I had a family to feed. Yes, my dollars were smeared with Chapstick, but those dirty little bastards paid the bills. Salary (and retainers) are next to slavery, but it was the devil I knew…

Now, if left to my own motivation, I probably would never have made a change. But then the day came that caused a shift in my soul…

I got the phone call that my father died…

Guess where I was at? Did you guess at work? Sadly, you’re right.

I’m still ashamed to admit…

I promised my dad for months I would take him out fishing again. It’s a promise I broke. I was busy. I was ALWAYS busy at work. That’s the way life (hell) is on the “expense” side of someone else’s column. But that day was THE day I truly committed to change.

I was fed up with breaking promises to my family…

…so that I could keep my promises to a boss or client.

My priorities didn’t change. My family was always a priority…

But I clearly saw that I wasn’t LIVING my priorities. Living outside integrity hurts. My father’s death and my broken promise was excruciating. But it was the crisis that changed everything…

I slowly figured out ways to move from being viewed as an unwelcome expense…

…to a welcomed paycheck.

At first, it was super hard…

I was trying to CREATE almost all of my own assets.

* …I was trying to build a list
* …Create content
* …Get my websites built and ranked on search engines
* …Drive my own traffic
* …blog
* …build my Youtube channel
* …hire and train my own outsourcers and assistants

It worked. Kinda. But now I was even busier. And truth be told…

Even though I was on the expense side of the P&L for companies…

And I knew they’d never “fire me”. I was working even MORE. And MY EXPENSES were rising.

“Fa\*k me!”

The breakthrough came when I desperately needed cash to scale a campaign that was really crushing it for me…

I just didn’t have the money to fund the campaign…

But I did create the ads, the funnel, autoresponder sequence and angles and it was turning every $1 I could feed into it to $5… in less than 7 days.

The campaign was based on a sporting event…which would be over in about 40 days…

I wasn’t confident of my ability to get someone to lend me the money. And my credit was shot because I was newly self-employed.

So, to make a long story short(er)…

I found a partner. (Who had deep pockets.) We made a DEAL!

(NOTE: 5 and 6-figure deals are way more abundant than 5 and 6-figure clients…and there is NO CHAPSTICK on the dollars.)

I’d RENT him my ads, funnel and autoresponder sequences. I got 10% of gross sales. Within 48 hours…

I was making thousands per DAY! I didn’t have to “run” and manage the ads. I didn’t have to drive any traffic at all. I didn’t have to deliver any “services” to a client. I just banked the Chapstick-Free income. It was short-lived because it was centered around a sporting event.

But…

I had a breakthrough! And that breakthrough was the TRUE WEALTH…

My financial life was never the same again…

I never had to take crap from a client again. I’ve gone on to make millions in Chapstick-free income. I call the breakthrough The 30 Year Wealth Shortcut. I’ve figured out even faster ways to go from zero to income in days. If all my wealth vanished tonight…

…and I had to start over from scratch

…and I couldn’t even use my name…

… if I could get someone to lend me their iPhone for 72 hours, I'd create at least a $5k a month income stream (probably more) within a week or two.

Gimme another few weeks and I’ll be pulling down a doctor’s income.

Under ANY economic conditions.

\------------------------------------------------------  
**Wednesday - 22.01.25 (small mystical experience during flight)**  
Guys, I am a little bit sorry, that my posts are getting long even on my terms. However, I just want to get my thoughts out and maybe someone can relate to my journey better. And I also don’t want to make it quick and dirty, because it waters down the point of view.

**0305 - 0321: Meditation GOLOV + stretch**  
Thought about mum -> no feelings.  
Thought about grandmum -> feelings of love occured  
Why is it then I sometimes feel the love and sometimes I don't? I don't know yet.  
**0321 - 0336: Meditation generate gratitude + stretch**  
**0336 - 0350: Meditation generate empowerment + stretch**  
I don’t find the generating series to be effective for what they are for. All I feel is probably a sense of calm and being in the present moment. So instead of listening to these 15 mins meditation, I rather listen 7 times to a 2 min NLP technique, which actually lets me feel more joy. Maybe I will find something better on youtube.

My taxi to the airport arrived at 0430.  
2 minutes into the drive to the airport I noticed myself smiling for no reason at all. Why would I smile when I have go back to work now? Because I am whole. I kept on smiling the whole 30 min drive. I just listened to an audiobook, as I was waiting for boarding and during the first flight I fell alseep instantly.

At the next airport, I bought one overpriced coffee, which I usually never ever do.  This new me seems to be rich. After the coffee I looked for a place to meditate. I started with a lying down position to see how it goes. I was a little bit afraid about my stuff being stolen, so I put my passport and wallet into my jeans and placed my bag in between four seats. I meditated with Sony wh-1000xm4. I could still hear some stuff happening around me even with noise canceling but well. That’s life. F\*\*\* perfectionism. It is actually was good exercise to focus on the meditation as sounds appear, because it is the same with my own mind ""says"" someting.

**1326 - 1343: Meditation GOLOV**  
2 seconds into the meditation I was thinking ""what if I cry?"" and I checked my phone for other meditations for 5 seconds. Then I thought ""wtf am I doing? Nobody gives a f\*\*\* if I cry and nobody gives a f\*\*\* about me"". And I restarted GOLOV meditation. I thought about mum and grandmum and my eyes got watery a bit. I don’t know if it was visible for other people. And even if, nobody cares, because everybody is in their own fucking head imagining worst case scenarios. During the meditation I was thinking about visiting my grandmum in Estonia this year, since I am postponing this since 2016 or so.

**1346 - 1416: Meditation BOTEC 7 (1,5x speed)**  
I really had to pee. At 1416 I couldn’t hold on anymore. I took my stuff and went to the toilet. As I finished peeing, I asked myself should I lie down again or sit? As I came out, my place was occupied. „Okay I understand“ I said to myself and sat down somewhere else continued meditating.  
During this meditation my 2nd energy center changed from a Dragon Ball into a tiger, whom also transforms into a humanoid form with the head of a tiger.  
Additionally my aligning and connecting of the energy centers changed. As the numbers of the energy centers are being said, my first center covers this energy center up by shooting up a wall of magma.

I went peeing after meditation, 10 min break listening to anything and went to the gate,

**1448 - 1514: Introduction BOTEC 2**  
As I listened to this introduction, I noticed that my ultra instinct of energy center 3 is ""wrong"". Because according to the introduction the gut feeling is energy center 2, not 3. However, I do not care about that now. My unconscious mind will tell me when to change energy centers 2 and 3.

Being in the plane I waited for the lift off, to imagine my new potential far away from me as a small picture and as the plane accelerated I moved this new potential towards me, making it bigger and brighter and bathing my self in this feeling of my new potential.

**1612 - 1646 finish: Meditation BOTEC 2 (1,5x speed)**  
The meditation was ok with 1,5x speed. From 3rd to 5th energy center I was thinking about something and I didn’t notice it. As 5 was said and I realized I was somewhere else with my mind and tuned back into meditation.  
Apart from that, I had to pee a little bit in the beginning. I didn’t go to toilet on purpose. I wanted to sit in the fire again. 😂

Right after the meditation I went peeing, came back and the stewardesses where one seat in front of me giving out food. Perfect timing I guess. I chilled for next minute and ate trying staying in present moment without thinking about anything. Apart from 3 thoughts, I succeeded staying in the present moment saying in my mind „mmh mmh this tasty. Yes yes. Lalalala“ lol. Don’t ask my why I did this, I guess my new self does this kind of stuff and doesn’t give a fuck anymore.  
And as I wrote this sentence, I remembered the time I went to the toilet on my last flight. I opened up the lid and there was some shit at the back of the toilet. I was like „well, shit“. Then I took 10 paper towels and wiped it away. After that I washed my hands three times imagining I would purify my hands with the hellfire from purgatory. That’s some „be in the unknown shit, right there“. I won’t say I loved this, but at least I know I changed. 😂

**1716 - 1743: Meditation changing box short + introduction**  
This meditation was so good.  
But first let me tell you something Dr. Joe said on a live stream (I paraphrase):  
*""When you are traveling, you are out of your usual habitat. This means you are in the unknown and this is the best time to meditate.""*

Now, back to my experience with the meditation.  
At first many thoughts came up and I had to fight to get back into the present moment. It went on and on until Dr. Joe says „imagine a possibility, where your challenge doesn’t exit“. Then I remembered the infinite possibilities, which I visualized, while doing the changing boxes walking meditation once.

Everything is black. I only see an infinite number of white dots in this black see of nothingness. I saw this sea again in this meditation and before I finished conjuring up „infinite possibilities“ (a lot of white dots so to speak), there was  one white dot already shining brightly like a guiding North Star and I was like „oh cool. I will take that“ then Dr. Joe instructs „pull that future to you with your heart“ and immediately I see Scorpion form mortal combat making his „[get over here move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6z4lOuARtI)“ throwing out a spear, which is connected to a string and in mortal combat the enemy will be pierced and get pulled over.

In the next second I was like „wait. That’s too fierce. That’s not my enemy.“ The next second Scorpion transformed into a gay guy and made the same move. Only the string was pink and at the end of the string was a pink heart. At the same time the gay guy says „uuuuh come over here sexy boooi “ (in a gay and trying to be seductive voice). So that future, where the challenge doesn’t exist was pulled over to me. It was financial freedom. The future and I looked at each other. Gave us a bro handshake. Then hugged. Slowly our legs started to merge, becoming one and the more we merged, the faster the merging process became. As we finished merging, the gay guy threw me an hand air kiss and said „My job here is dooooonhan (done)“ and flew away. As the meditation came to a close, I suddenly I knew who the gay guy was. It was the fat gay guy from modern family (Cameron Tucker). And As I realized this, he appeared again saying „guuuuuuiltyyy“ and flew away again..

I was totally grinning, because I loved this visualization and I have to say „the unknown has a superb sense of humor. I love it.“ and I kid you not. In the same second I wrote this sentence with the unknown having a superb sense of humor. Two stuff people came to. One was lighting at me with a flashlight and the other one said  
„How are you?“ „me: Good“  
„Did you press the button for service? „me: No I didn’t“  
„But the signal come from this seat“ „me: No I didn’t press the button“  
„okay okay no problem“.  
And I didn’t press the button. Not even accidentally. Both my hands were on fire writing this paragraph.

I also remember a regular squeak sound, which was happening for about a minute (so it was not someone changing positions in his seat, because it was a minute long and occuring on a fast regular time interval) and also, it happened exactly before I wrote the sentence about the humor. Like a charging up before the unknown or mystical experience happens. (That was the small mysctial experience).  
At 1809 I finished writing this paragraph. Pee pause, then next meditation.

**1819 - 1913: Meditation TINP + breath work from BOTEC 5 (9 mins)**  
Nothin special to report. As I was thinking about my first potential I imagined my bath tub filled with 50€ notes orbiting around my new potential and I was grinning really hard. My old self would have noch done that, because other people could see me doing that. My old self might have smiled a little bit.

**1915 - 1926: Meditation** [**guided gratitude meditaton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfD4HaBBc0I)  
I tried this gratitude mediation to see if I actually feel gratitude. Don’t know if it worked.

**1927 - 2135: Center of the Magnet (DOHA time)**  
I listened to the meditation at 1,5x speed (regular playtime: 2 std 40).  
It was okay. It is focusing on heart first and then on heart and brain coherence. During the breath it focuses on 2 things: 1. Drawing energy from the earth into your heart and then pulling energy from the cosmos into the heart. I will do this meditation this weekend again.

The plane landed at \~1940 (GERMAN time). Had to wait \~ 40 mins for my bag. I was at home at \~ 2230. I finished unpacking etc. and went to bed at 2335 and went to sleep.

\------------------------------------------------------  
**Further insights, which came to me during my flights and meditations**

* At some point Dr. Joe said ""What are you willing to give up to get what you want?
   * I rephrased it into: What are you willing to sacrifice like an offering, like a sacrifical pawn to the universe to get what you want?
* This made me think the following:
* Enough of partying, it is time to double down on this meditation stuff. You know, I am always do things in a radical way. There is no average way to do something for me. I am either in or I am out. I hate average.
* Quote from Grant Cardone
   * Imagine this advertisement:
   * Join us in our new average cinema. With average seats, with average sound quality and with an average sized movie screen. Our coca cola and other drinks taste purely average and our popcorn is made out of the most average ingredients to satisfy you to an average extent.
   * How much do you want to go to this cinema?
   * If not at all, why are you living your life in an average way?
* I decided to go into monk mode for at least until March, because the progressive retreat in Basel is at the end of February and if I immerse myself in meditation and Dr. Joe's teachings, I can be my most upgraded self at the retreat in Basel. Additionally, I can get on a consistent sleep schedule and wake up before work easily to meditate as well.
   * And even if nothing happens during these 2 months of full immersion into meditation, at least I rejuvenated my body.
* I set my alarm for 0400. This means I have to be sleeping at 2030 to get 7,5 hours of sleep. 1 sleep cycle is 90 minutes long, so it is always best to aim for a sleeping duration, which is a multiplication of 90 minutes.

\------------------------------------------------------  
**Todays's total meditation time: \~ 5 hours 42 mins (22.01.25)**  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques**

* **Italian love**
   * See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
   * Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
   * Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?
* **Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**
   * When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
   * And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
   * Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
   * Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe. Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
   * Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?
* **Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**
   * Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance
      * or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
   * and see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
   * know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you having already banished your old self from your current life
   * and your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
   * PS: I'm not kidding.
* **Banana Boss**
   * I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
   * Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
   * As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
      * One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
      * Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
      * Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
      * One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
      * One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and say ""This a\*\*hole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.
   * Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
   * NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this. It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.

Tattoo artist doxxed me after I asked for my money back… Am I in the wrong?,tattooadvice,1i9uqyl,2025-01-25 14:24:51,1,0.53,57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9uqyl,anathemav,General Advice,"Almost a year ago, I contacted an artist I found on Instagram through email. We discussed my tattoo’s design and a $250 deposit for them to draw my design. They said $175 would go towards my tattoo, and the other $75 would be the drawing fee. I let them know that since I’m a student, I’d save up and Zelle the deposit to their husband as soon as I could. I see that there were many red flags now, I guess hindsight really is 20/20. 

In November 2024, I sent the $250 deposit to the artist’s husband through Zelle and asked about their availability since it would be a 4-5 hour drive to their city. They said they needed four days for the design, but would likely have it done the next day. Five days later, I reach out asking about the design since I’ve heard absolutely nothing. They asked for a couple more days. Five more days later, I emailed them asking again about the design and availability and gently let them know that if they weren’t comfortable with the design, I wouldn’t mind taking it to someone else. Then they finally sent me the design with just “Sorry for the wait !”. No response to anything else. 

I was very specific when I first described the design, providing many reference photos for placement, style, and design. The artist said they wouldn’t need any more details when I offered more photos. After I received the design (which I could tell was traced off of the first image off of Google, because the front legs became antennae), I sent some more photos asking for corrections on the design. Politely. 

At this point, they respond and say they’ll have it done by my appointment. And break the news that they’re tattooing out of their apartment… I’m panicking. This would be my second tattoo but it sounds fucking shady. They offer to tattoo out of their friend’s studio for an additional fee. The same day, I politely restated my availability and told them I understood and would be bringing my partner for my own comfort/safety and offered that they could do the same since we’re two strangers in their home. I don’t know what happened, but I can’t see the email even though I sent it ten times because it was sitting in my outbox. I was under the impression they received it, so eight more days later I emailed asking very politely for more communication and possibly a refund. Immediately (for once), they respond and said that they will not break their no refund policy and that “no further communication is needed”. 

At this point I don’t know what this “artist” will do next, so I talk to my bank and let them know that I paid a deposit for a tattoo and did not receive the tattoo. I wanted my money back, $250 is a lot for me, and I already knew the artist’s answer so I wasn’t going to start arguing with them because they were so far very unpredictable. 

That night I get tagged in a story from an account which has blocked me. It’s the artist. They label me as a scammer on their Instagram story and doxx me—my full legal name is out there with an account it was previously not associated with. Also, they thanked Zelle for providing my name as if I wasn’t signing all of my emails as my name? For context, they’ve changed their display name maybe ten times in this period on Instagram. They also threaten to sue me. 

You can read the email I sent back weeks later. They respond basically berating me.

I know it’s my fault and I should have been firmer, I just hate to be an inconvenience (but I see now that I paid them for a service and they did not provide). I have no idea what to do. It’s been a month but I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel like you can see how much I tried to be kind and polite… I have no idea what I did to deserve this. Was I rude and/or wrong? I feel so much guilt. 

What can I do about this? Does anyone have any advice?
