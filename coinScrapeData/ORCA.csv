Lib Tech MC Wayfinder II 155 vs Orca 153 comparison pics.,snowboarding,1i9xegq,2025-01-25 16:21:55,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xegq,NintenJoo,OC Photo,"I posted a thread a while ago asking for comparisons and there wasn‚Äôt much info. 
A friend gets reasonably steep discounts at Mervin so I bought a 2025 Orca to potentially replace my Wayfinder. 

Figured I‚Äôd share some pics. 

It‚Äôs pretty clear to me that the Orca is a powder board. 

It‚Äôs almost identical to the wayfinder from side by side comparison. Waist size etc is almost identical. 

It says the Orca is 2.5‚Äù set back compared to the wayfinder 4‚Äù. 

And I guess it is based on the board profile? I think that‚Äôs how they do it. 

But not by actual measurements. The nose is almost the same size. Front and rear insert packs are in the same spots when the boards are lined up. 

You can definitely see more camber front and back foot compared to the wayfinder. That‚Äôs the C2 vs C2x. "

Can I clear these files off an external SD card?,AskElectronics,1i9x36w,2025-01-25 16:07:55,0,0.33,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x36w,AnxiousPirate,,"My dad needs more storage space on his Android Galaxy A20 so I went out and bought an external microSD card. When I went to install it, I found one already in his phone, probably there since the day he bought the phone 5 years ago. The problem is it has files on it yet it needs to be formatted to be used further. (6gb of it is in use and the other 238gb is unavailable). Formatting will clear everything already on the card.

I see the card is holding things like voicemails and documents that we can easily determine what is worth emailing to himself before we format the card. But it's also holding stuff like this (see pictures) that I need your help figuring out if it's bad for it to be wiped out. There's more than that. 

I just don't want my dad's phone need to be factory reset if I mess this up and delete important files. If you can't already tell, I'm not very tech savvy so please ELI5. lol

Is it ok to clear these? Any advice is appreciated!"

My 60 days With Creality,Creality_k2,1i9uzvc,2025-01-25 14:35:34,3,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creality_k2/comments/1i9uzvc/my_60_days_with_creality/,ZephnathAlpha,,"Got my K2 Plus back in Dec, and was extremely excited to get it open and start printing helmets and other large prints. The box was HUGE! üòÇ I expected that, but it still took my breath away. 

  
**Part 1: Unboxing and Setup**

I took pictures of the unboxing incase I needed to shared with Creality at some point, or to share in a post such as this. It was during unboxing that I discovered the Door hinge had snapped off the printer during transit. The epoxy use to hold the door onto the printer likely succumbed to the temperature differences and failed. 

[Failed Door Hinge](https://preview.redd.it/3rc1rcf6j6fe1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=44a80e8a05947ad987f7577d212f346b1a17c2cb)

  
üòî not a great start, but I was confident Creality would take of this, there was no way I was going to return the long awaited for 3D Printer. So I continued with unboxing. 

Here are my thoughts on the unboxing experience:  
Pros: 

* Other than the door, everything was in great apparent condition
* Well packed and everything was snug
* Creality including the tool kit was a nice touch and appreciated
* Creality's slicer is an okay experience, I like it. Still prefer OrcaSlicer, but I'm not rolling my eyes and cursing the world anytime I switch over to Creality Print.

Cons:

* On a scale of 1 to Bambu, we're a good deal away from Bambu. It took a while to unbox and setup, but it wasn't at Prusa levels where I needed a bag of gummy bears to keep going, so that's a win in my opinion.
* Some of the screws holding the build bed were overly tightened and took some extra torch to remove.
* Some of the screws were in locations that were awkward to reach, unless you have tiny hands

  
**Part 2: Creality Support**

I'm not saying I am not thrilled with Creality's support, but I think watching paint dry is a preferable way spend my time than waiting for their support team to email you.

It took over 24 hours for Creality reply to every email I sent them...excuse me...It took only 24 hours for their Ebay Team to reply to every email, it took their support team over 48 hours to reply. Their eBay team eventually got me the replacement door.

Fortunately their help videos and error documents are fairly good, which was useful when resolving my first pair of errors.

  
(For those looking for support, use WhatsApp and contact them there, much more responsive. Here's their number: +86 190 0756 9370)



**Part 3: The first issues**

My first error codes occurred on the second print, which was my first real print because I'm not convinced Boaty really counts.

https://preview.redd.it/srqpytx1n6fe1.png?width=238&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae76c24826818d5893e87fe60626ce9c7fd5051e

* FB2846:The filament buffer signal is abnormal, the buffer may be stuck or the filament may be tangle.
* XS2060: Printing has been canceled\[System error, try restarting\] 

Restarting, no surprise, didn't fix the issues.

Fortunately I was able to follow the error codes on FB2846 to find that it was a loose connection from the CFS to the Main printer. Giving things a good push until the clip snapped into place appears to have cleared this error for good. 

The XS2060 error, didn't really find many helpful documents for. And there error persisted after reboots. I eventually came to a theory that the issue was the outlet that the printer was plugged into. So I switched things around and my theory was confirmed when I was able to finally start printing. ü•≥



**Part 4: Printing (finally, or so I thought)**

The first print looked great. I didn't find it to be a good as my Bambu printers, but it was at least comparable. 

Things were looking up for the K2 Plus. I finally it running and giving me prints, now was the time to try some helmets. So I loaded the Daredevil helmet model into the printer and hit print, totally forgetting to ensure that my spool would have enough filament to complete the print. But hey, that's what the CFS is for right?....RIGHT?

Apparently not. This misstep led to the filament somehow jamming the nozzle. Had to get the tools out, and began the disassembly needed to get to the nozzle. Fortunately the tools Creality gives you has a tool just for clearing clogged filaments. (It's the one that looks like a lobotomy pick)

[this is the one](https://preview.redd.it/sw1or3hhr6fe1.png?width=39&format=png&auto=webp&s=48aa783e47fa4a8e5836f9b69bb300a0b9d2481d)

Great, cleared out. Now on to more printing.

I finally got a few prints out and a helmet. I thought things were good, I was starting to be happy with my purchase, and then, WHAMMY!

https://i.redd.it/ff6kl29rr6fe1.gif

One day I'm dealing with another pair of errors.



**Part 5: Creality Support Again**

These errors took a over a week to fix, and to be honest, I'm avoiding one of them while Creality support fulfills the other. That's right, I'm still waiting for Creality to fulfill replacement parts in relation to ""CF0109: Abnormal Heat Break Fan.""

Creality's support actually didn't respond to my email I sent over a week ago until today. The sighted reason? Chinese New Years. Fortunately, however, somebody in this Reddit was good enough to post the WhatsApp number, which go me to somebody, even outside their normal working hours. üôè

I'm still waiting for the replacement part from Creality though. üòÇ

I ended up ordering the part I needed through Amazon, I actually did this before contacting Creality, because like I said in the beginning, I'd rather watch paint dry. The part's I needed arrived yesterday and I went to work replacing the Heatbreak Fan, even though there was a possibility it was actually the extruder's circuit board causing the issue.

  
**Part 6: The Heatbreak Fan**

For those who don't know, this is the Heatbreak fan:

[If it no spin spin, you get error](https://preview.redd.it/ixdsqmgku6fe1.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9b4eecdb4d00f396795db2d9f5ec3846394844f)

I point this out because, there appears to be no public documentation for this component other than it appearing in the parts list on the K2 Plus. I searched google, YouTube, Creality, and everywhere I could think, with little to nothing to help with this error.

Fortunately, did find some people on reddit who had the same error, but not really a solution to the error. Desperate not to have to deal with Creality support and wanting my printer going preferably this month, I went on a limb hoping Amazon would have the correct component. Turns out they did, though they aren't calling it a Heatbreak Fan. [LINK TO AMAZON](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRJLXDM8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

I was able to receive this with a couple days, and went to work replacing it. Which is where the real fun started because in order to replace this fan, you have to damn near disassemble the entire tool head. 

[thanks obama](https://preview.redd.it/n57vys5vv6fe1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cbcc1b9abde20e406b8f195eacb7587e4d5a79)

Since there is no video or document I could find, this replacement was done through trial and error...not exactly something desirable with a $1500 investment.

Took a couple hours to complete, but I got there. Once fully reassembled I pumped up the extruder temp and prayed the fan started spinning up. It did. YAY. Now I feel ready to handle nearly anything else this printer throughs at me.



**Conclusion**

Thanks for sticking around this far.  It has been less than 24 hours since replacing he Heatbreak fan, and I've completed my next Helmet. 

https://reddit.com/link/1i9uzvc/video/kxu2kshtx6fe1/player

  
I'm pleased with the quality and praying this is the end of the major issues.

I feel Creality came close on this one to being that ""Bambu Killer"", but my experience tells me they need to keep working on that. I suggest they start by making the Heatbreak fan a 5‚Äì10-minute replacement instead of a 1-3 hour replacement.

I do have a few gripes concerning the CFS, primarily that it regularly leads to issues with prints. But it is also terrible at the NFC recognition of spools in my opinion, with it either taking a long time to recognize the spool or not recognizing it at all.

  
**TL;DR**

Had the K2 Plus for a couple months and experience less than stellar support from Creality when trying to resolve hardware defects. Prints great when it is working. üòâ"

Can Creality Print or K2 Plus API Be Opened to Other Slicers for Color Printing?,Creality,1i9uqzg,2025-01-25 14:24:53,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creality/comments/1i9uqzg/can_creality_print_or_k2_plus_api_be_opened_to/,Embarrassed-Affect78,,"Has Creality talked about opening up Creality Print or the K2 Plus to be accessible via API so other slicers can print in color?

Right now, you can only use Creality Slicer (I haven't tried the app) or print directly from the printer panel in color. I've only managed to get Orca Slicer to print from the first slot in the CFS or an external spool.

I haven't seen any solutions posted by anyone yet.

This reminds me of what Bambu Labs is doing with Bambu Connect. The difference is that Creality made this change silently during the launch of the K2 Plus and didn't make a standalone app for people to use other than their slicer.

If Creality has already promised to open this API, could someone please share a link to the announcement?"

maybe  this a inspiration for others to get rid of the bambu cloud and their update without loosing functionality.

So here is what I did:

* I am using the X1Plus firmware for my X1C
* I use obico for AI spaghetti detection (self hosted)
* I use octoprint with the bambu lab plugin 
* I stream the camera stream by using go2rtc to convert the rtsp-stream to a HLS-stream octoprint can use.
* I connect to my network via a vpn (wireguard) to check on my printers
* As a slicer I use Orca slicer

English is not my first language so I won't/can't write a manual. But here are some useful links, which helped me a lot:

* Obico manual for self hosting: [https://www.obico.io/docs/server-guides/](https://www.obico.io/docs/server-guides/)

* go2rtc: [https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc) (I am using the docker version)
* Orca slicer: [https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer)

I am lucky I have a small server (intel nuc i7) to self host these services. To vpn into my lan I use wireguard because it is integrated in my router (fritz box) and there is a wireguard android app on my mobile.

  
I hope I could help the OpenBambu Community a bit.

  
P.S. English is not my first language, but I hope you can understand and you pardon some spellling mistakes.

I feel like it's a worthy gamble to make this post again, especially with the attention the last one had! 

For reference, the corporation I run has been around since August 2023, I made it on the decision when I was still living in null and became bored with the daily life and wanted to try something different, completely unaware it would take off rapidly, and having just myself, a couple billion I saved up and maybe a networth of 10b, into what it has become today with a stable orca production line, multiple daily mining fleets, self-sufficiency in our industry and last year having bought over half a trillion isk of ore from our members to utilise in our industry, selling through the market and contracted groups on deals, PVP ship replacements and much more.

Feel free to ask whatever you wish in relation to it, if it's something I don't pose to be a concern to our wellbeing, I will happily answer. I've linked the previous AMA we did to cover the background and also any common questions you may find on there.

I know the last one had a lot of pull, and there was plenty of questions asked, I will once again attempt to answer as many of them as I can and give people an idea to what it's like running a mining corporation, as well as a place aspiring CEO's can also gather some information and support in their eve careers! :) I'll get to this as soon as I can throughout my days and will answer at the periods of downtime I have! :)

Small Area and Change of Color,ElegooNeptune4,1i9r7yo,2025-01-25 11:52:44,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElegooNeptune4/comments/1i9r7yo/small_area_and_change_of_color/,PicopoFra,Help,"Hi everyone! I have printed this [Korok](https://www.printables.com/model/550373-korok-low-poly-from-zelda-botw) using my Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro, and I must admit I‚Äôm quite satisfied with the result. However, I encountered some issues with the leaf. As you can see, when the extruder needs to fill small areas, it seems unable to do so properly or extrudes significantly more filament than necessary. Do you have any suggestions on how to fix this?  
The printer [has been calibrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjKYpC08Jxk), and the bed variance is 0.0988.

Additionally, to create the multi-color print, I followed the procedure described by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M7PfyF0EFk). In Orca Slicer, I added a customized G-code (M600) during the slicing process, and it worked. However, I noticed [in this video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI1Eg6PvTXg)that Orca Slicer has an option to change filament colors directly in the slicer without manually adding the M600 command each time. This also allows me to select different configurations depending on the type of filament. When I try this method, though, the printer doesn‚Äôt pause as it did before.

Does anyone know why this happens or how to resolve it? Thanks!

I‚Äôve searched GitHub and this is reported in both OrcaSlicer and Bambu Studio.  Seems to be related to the network plug-in from what others have said.  I‚Äôve tried the work around of changing the config from user_access_code to access_code but it seems to get reset at some point.  I wonder if this could be due to the weak WiFi on the P1S? The printer is 15ft away from the mesh access point and has line of sight. Very Annoying.  Are others experiencing this and has anyone else found a better solution?

502 Gateway error after installing OctoEverywhere,OrcaSlicer,1i9p37i,2025-01-25 10:17:46,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrcaSlicer/comments/1i9p37i/502_gateway_error_after_installing_octoeverywhere/,Remy_Jardin,,"I am running Klipper on a BTT Pad 7.  I installed OctoEverywhere yesterday, and in the 1st print that I have tried since installing it I am getting the 502 Gateway error.  I have rebooted the machines, done a firmware restart, the file itself is tiny, barely 1 MB. I have changed the address of my printer in Orca to the shared connection link from OctoEverywhere.

The main difference between directly pointing to the IP address and the shared connection link is the file appears to upload completely with the shared connection (shows 100%), but then after a pause I get the 502 error again.

I can access the printer through mainsail both from a web browser and within the device tab of Orca slicer itself. So I'm able to connect easily to the printer and do all the other stuff I normally could do in mainsail, I just can't upload a file for printing.

So, 2 questions, 2 further observations:

1. I've seen the 502 error pop-up with Orca slicer before and it appears it may be a memory issue, but that is clearly not the case for a 1 MB file when I have 25 gigs available on the SD card.  This appears to be a configuration issue either with Klipper or with Orca after the Octo install.  Does anyone have any clue on what I should be looking for how to address this? I am by no means a Linux/Python expert.
2. Keeping in mind I am not a Linux expert, how can I completely remove the OctoEverywhere installation?  Would the easiest answer be to do a factory reset, re-update everything, and then reinstall my backed up configuration files?
3. I was able to confirm this is NOT an Orca issue.  Both Prusa and Cura slicers lost the ability to upload prints to the printer as well.
4. After uninstall and a few restarts, I now can send files to print as normal.  So, this is 100% an OctoEverywhere issue."
SlicerSelector While Opening Your 3MF or STL Files - AppleScript for macOS,3Dprinting,1i9obhj,2025-01-25 09:40:33,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1i9obhj/slicerselector_while_opening_your_3mf_or_stl/,kilinccagatay,,"https://preview.redd.it/n9hvqt60j5fe1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8b9aedd840c00fc44481d6136636567d064a6f1

Hi everyone,

I just created a quick guide showing how to use a simple AppleScript on macOS to select your preferred slicer (like Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, or Creality Print) when opening 3MF or STL files. Instead of manually opening your slicer every time, this script lets you choose one from a list as soon as you open a file.

The video walks you through:

* Setting up the script in¬†**Script Editor**
* Saving it as an application to your¬†**Applications**¬†folder
* Customizing the slicer list or default selection

**Why this is useful:**

* Saves time for those working with multiple slicers.
* It makes managing 3D printing files smoother and more organized.
* Works seamlessly with macOS!

I have been the proud owner of a Bambulab A1 printer for a few days now. I chose this printer because it is considered to be beginner-friendly and at the same time produces high-quality prints.



I'm really looking forward to this new hobby because, as a technology-loving student, I've been looking for a creative way to realise my ideas for a long time. So far, I haven't had the opportunity to work intensively with slicers such as the Bambu Slicer or OrcaSlicer, as I simply don't have the time. Instead, I have printed simple models from the Makerspace library to gain some initial experience.



In the future, however, I would like to design my own models and experiment with the printer.



Now I've ended up here in this subreddit and have noticed that many users are outraged by the recent changes to Bambulab. This has made me a bit insecure. So I have a few questions and would appreciate your advice:



* Should I return the printer? 
* How serious is it that I might not be able to use the OrcaSlicer? 
* Should I be worried about my data? I don't really have anything to hide, but your concerns make me wonder.
* What exactly will change if I install the new firmware update?
* Is it worth waiting in the hope that OrcaSlicer might still be supported?
* what else will be lost as a result of the changes Bambulab is making?

I apologise if my questions seem a little naive - I'm still at the very beginning and am just trying to familiarise myself with the subject. I would really appreciate your opinions and tips. 

best wishes - I am grateful for any answer"

This also happened with another similar print in the same filament, but it hasn't happened on other filaments before that. It it (like everything) a problem of wet filament? I was just extra confused because of the inconsistency of the problem, but I have no idea. 

Settings as above, basically default. Bambu Lab P1P with 0.4 mm nozzle. Bambu PLA Basic Black filament.

Thank you!

  New Build

‚Ä¢ Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links) 

None

‚Ä¢ PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/ games)

Blender, 3DS Max, Reality capture, Photoshop, ORCA (quantum chemistry program), Unreal engine 5, AI workloads

‚Ä¢ Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors)

Netherlands, I usually prefer the website Azerty.nl for parts but any place that ships in the Netherlands is fine to me.


‚Ä¢ Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution)

Single monitor, 32"", 4K, OLED, 240hz. I don't know if that is smart though with burn in and stuff so any suggestions are welcomed.

‚Ä¢ Budget range? (Include tax considerations) 

5500-6500 euros (it's a non issue if it's in the higher end of that range or slightly exceeds it if required)

‚Ä¢ WiFi or wired connection? 

Both, preferably wifi7 for future proofing 

‚Ä¢ Size/noise constraints? 

Preferably big for airflow but not excessive. As for noise I would like it to be quiet but I can handle a bit of noise.

‚Ä¢ Color/lighting preferences? 

I like a sleek dark look with lots of shades of gray but some nice LED's would be nice if they don't look too over the top or overpowering the entire aesthetic I guess.

‚Ä¢ Any other specific needs

I would like a good AIO cooler with a nice big radiator. Preferably an ATX motherboard with lots of I/O and multiple USB C outputs that also support display port over USB C. One thing of note is that I would like to get it assembled by the store as it allows me to get a 3 year warranty and full repair service, this costs 140 euros.


__________________________


Basically I have a pretty old PC, I called her Bessie because she is an old cow. She has a 1070 and a 7790K and 32GB of some relatively cheap DDR4 RAM. Anyways, I finally want to declutter my mind and also my computer and start working for either my dad or for myself in some creative spaces that involve 3D photogrammetry and the creations of assets. To do this I will need a lot of GPU power so I have saved up for a year to get the 5090 when it came out. 

Another use case will be training and running AI models but it won't be a source of income and more of a hobby I guess. Oh yeah and Gaming :)

I figured if I was spending that much already I might as well try and make it pretty and finally own a PC that it truly top spec for once. Therefore I have come up with some requirements for what I am looking for but because I am not very well versed in the current tech scene as compared people doing the builds I have seen on here and i dont really follow the current trends.

Anyways, I was thinking of getting 2 x 48 GB DDR5 RAM with a clocks clockspeed higher then 6500MHz preferably, a 4TB SSD, a Ryzen 9 9950X maybe and then the 5090. Other then that I haven't really looked into it all that much. If the budget can't stretch that far I am willing to opt for a non OLED monitor because why not. 4k is gonna be a big step up from my 1080p screen rn.

Anyways, I like computers that have that sci-fi element to it with bold edges and nice clean looking parts, I would like to be able to see inside the computer and enjoy looking at my 6 months of saving up materialised haha. I don't want to compromise functionality for aesthetic though and AIO coolers with like industrial milled aluminum look just as cool as ones with cool LED matrices and stuff on them. 

Huge thanks in advance for anyone who can help me out here!"

My chosen slicer for the Neptune 4 Plus is Orca, it's been incredible, so easy, amazing print quality and so fast.. no complaints at all.

Now to the Neptune 3 Pro, I tried Orca previously and prints were slooww.  Cura Ultimaker seemed to work better for the Marlin system.

Now my dilemma, which slicer printer settings do I use and trust?

Orca with standard Neptune 3 Pro (updated to reflect Klipper in the settings) is still slow, so damn slow.  And print quality is ok.

Orca using Klipper setting seemed to work ok and decent speeds, quality a little lacking but that's probably more to do with getting the level/settings right.

Orca using Neptune 4 Pro settings updated into the Neptune 3 Pro settings for Orca worked ok but print quality is all over the place.

I'm leaning towards adjusting the Klipper printer settings, is this what everyone else did?? I'm open to any suggestions and help.

Thank you!!!"

Now its like this:

with Kong on his towards Hollow earth back with his ape family, Destroyah is on his way to the last standing outpost of monarch. he senses the presence of a delicious Titan but as he scans the area no Titan is found. Bernie Hayes had used the reconstructed to lure all of the destroyah angranents to his trap. once the Agranents are right where he wants them he unlashes a Sonic Blast that mimics ghadorah's gravity beam that sets them all on fire,¬†**most**¬†of them turn into dust. it only killed most few, some severely injured, Most damaged beyond repair but still alive. bernie tries again but the outpost is out of power he tries to check the powerbraker when he relies the power was shut off, it diden't lose power. ""Shut off? by Who!?"" Bernie looks up and its ren serizawa looking down at him with yellow glowing eyes like a ghost that had a physiacal form. Barnies tries to convince him to help or all of life is doomed, if the agrenents multipli again there will be nothing left of the planet to stop them.

but given how Ren is possessed by the ghost of ghidorah Centre head, he just smiles and he says through ghidorah ""Long live the King"" accepting destroyah as the New King. he unlocks the gate that the Agranets are locked behind and they sarm like Zombies. Barnie runs for it, Detroyah is aware of his precense thanked to rebuild Orca and uses his Oxygen blast to melt the outpost. un be known to destroyah barnie has made his wat outside, barnie attempts to run away but a Agranent jumps right in front of him Slashing his face casing great scar on his left eye. he collapses to the ground and can't do any thing but wallow in his distress.

with destroyah about the use his final attack on barnie. Barnie can only look at the past life he had with his wife silently sobbing knowing he will final see her again. and with a flash of white light he is immediately turned into a pile of bones.

after destroyah feeds of barnie's life force, he looks up and checks something¬†**freezing**¬†is approaching near the horizon a crestal set of dorsal plates is freezing the ground and approaching fast. Destroayh lets out a disturbing Screeching roar challenging the Blizzard lizard.

Shimo jumps from the hillside and roars back. (with Godzilla, Rodan, tiamnt, kyriu, gamera, Mothra, Komanga, frankinstin, Suko and Tyrannosaurus are in Space, no one is here to bring balance to the planet execpt Kong, Mothra and Shimo, until they get back, their on their own).

Shimo unleshes a frostbite Blast at Destroyah knocking him down. Destroyah fully challenged has some fun with this. they charge at each other and the stage is set for the rematch of a millennia. Destroayh figures this will be a bit of a challenge even for him. time to even the odds, he explodes into a Oxygen destroyer Explodtion at a 200 mile radius. Shimo gets completely knocked back, she is severely burned and cut. Now they're Equals, her and Destroyah.

destoyah's immense Power refill allows him to begin regenerating from the inuries he endured from the Frost bite Blast. Destroyah begins to overwhelm shimo with his Overwhelming Force. he grabs her by the neck with his pincer tail and flies her to the stratosphere then they both fall faster then a speeding meteor back to Earth's atmosphere. shimo is in critical condition and is coughing up blood, but she still has enough strength and power to keep fighting (they were equals after all). destroyah knows what he must do he uses his pincer horn and mimics one of Shimo's worst experences. he mimics the crystal the scar king used on her Years ago and tries to command her this time, he commanded her to harm herself. but he wanted to do something to her before eating her. he clamed own his jaw down to her bone meal, he injected some oxygen destoayer mess into system that way she will die shortly after enslaving her.

shimo shrieks in grave pain. the bright Purple, Blue, White Energy is being transferred from Shimo's to destoyah's the vibrence from Shimo is fading life force being drain but he stops mid second so she would't die immediately. he wanted to give her a falling down then he Flies away and leaves her life less body to die, but she won't die yet.

destoyah lets go of the sky and examines his new ability his orange=red mouth had become a Hellish Dark blue/ Dark Red swarl. with his new found abilities freezes the storm above him. Now he is a God of the Monsters. with range of 2, 261 miles he unlashes an oxygen blast in a horrific sense, he uses an alpha call that reaches all over the planet. an oxygen destroyer Explosions reaches at a 2, 261 mile range.

his mere precincts seta world wide Earthquake and a global ice age Blizzard storm at the same time. desytoyah is stronger then ever.

humanity can only watch as destoyah roars in the clouds. just as barnie expect the titans that the orca summoned begin charging to destoyah to battle him to be the next Alpha titan. destroyah will have lots of fun with this before he eats them alive he's going to fight every single Titan at once. it was as if the Great demon from Hell was about to reack havoc on Every life on Earth. he didn't have any commands for the Titans he only summoned him here just to kill them, for their survival the titans will have no choice but to battle destoayh but with High difficulty.

Behmoth goes at attack first, Destroyah garbs him with his tail and throws him thousonds of feet into the sky he uses his oxygen blast to Disintegrate behemoth completely. all the other Titans stair in horror. and deside to run for thier lives, to bad detroyah will always find them no matter where they run or hide.

Monarchs has no more outpost on the surface to communicate to all the pervious workers are dead, especially Madison who has been turned into biollante along with jia.

the only titans alive who can save them all now is Kong and biollante They are their last Hope for survival. the military and the surviving monarch agents all travel to Hollow-Earth. as they reach Hollow Earth portal a Giant hand grabs one of the out craftships, it was Kong himself and he has a way to save the planet but first they must bring back Shimo.

ghidrah's ghost still had a telepathic connection to Ren Serisawa and Destoyah answered his call. Fortunately Kong was traveling thought he hollow-Earth portals like Godzilla. Poject g ressurection was good to go. the B2 bomber quickly ascended into the air 5 minutes from target location.

Biollante who was accoupide by jia at the moment was standing above Shimo's unconscious body, he injected her tendrils into Shimos bonemeal she injected her enegry into Shimo. Biollante kept doing this until her whole body collapse due to lack of nectarous and Jia crashed to the ground this is the punishment she got for hurting thousands of people.

with a Massive ice Explosions' shimo's shock waved rocked the eastcoast. she got up now fully overpowered and ready take her rematch against destroyah with a might roar she shocks something stronger then her frostbite blast her A0-Breath. she shoots it high into the atmosphere immediately freezing the Earth climent.

Shimo is ready for her rematch.

later into the film.

Godzilla and the rest of the titans are back on Earth and it is Hell on earth when they are at war with a multitude of Giant aliens including Ghidorah's father monster x also known as keizer ghidorah. the two start ducking it out but the main focus will go to Shimo and destoyah.

the Shock wave of the titans clashing had sent kong flying back with two powerhouses locked in a one-on-one. while shimo's powerUp had seen her become even more powerful then she was last time this was merely a sample of the power of the opponent that towered above her. Destroyah was about clashing into shimo until shimo kicks him thousonds of miles away from her. shimo begins charging at him until destroyah uses the same tactic the scar king used on her and it caused her to go in an extreme sense of pain.

Destroyah was about to rip her head off until, godzilla clashed in. he rolls his hands in to a fist and starts punching him left to right. destroyah uses his oxygen bite blast to put godzilla in his place. he impales his pincer tail into godzilla's belly. as he roars in pain destroyah briefly lifts him in the air and tosses him into the remaining rubble.

with Godzilla temporarily out of the fight Destroyah then turns to kong growling at him, to destroyah Kong is merely 30 feet tall compared to him.

Kong could see Death: the destroyer of worlds gliding toward him with steam coming out of his holes like a train engine. Kong grabs a nearby chuck of a building and hurls it towards Destroyah. Destroyah isn't effect by this at all, before the building could reach him it is desintergrated in mere seconds, he picks up kong only to drop him onto the Tokyo tower, the tower collapses Dislocating his arm from the beast glove, destroyah tries to use his oxegen bite Blast to both freeze and Slowly disintegrate kong Where it froze him. Kong uses the axe to brake the besat glove freeing his hand. before kong could Reach the ground the beastglove freezes then melts where its frozen. Kong is shocked to the bone never seeing such power. Kong begins to run on all fours leading destroyah on a chase running around multiple buildings seeing a red light reflect on one of the buildings he looks behind him, destroyah's body high in the air and without a moment's notice he unleashes an oxygen blast and a frostbite blast fly right past his head, he is knocked back by the oxygens explosion's that was set off next to him, some of his bones fall off, a few but still. Destroyah fires again, Kong running for for his life zig zags between buidlings finally one of the attcks hits Kong knocking him over. His left arm was engulfed in ice, he could feel the bones of his left arm shatter and suffocate. as he's on the ground Kong can only squirm in pain.

Destroyah stomps on kong's ribs hamring him almost killing him, Kong can't do anything other then look at destroayh, destroyah roars in Kong's face, Kong roars harshly despite his broken rips, he will never bow down to him! Destroyah wasn't expecting him to he only wanted to see the fear in his eyes before he launches his oxygen blast into Kong's mouth.

he hears a sound of dorsal plates lighting up and Destroyah gets knocked back a few feet by godzilla's Spiral heat ray. Destroyah responds with his oxygen blast into Godzilla's gills. Godzilla plummets to the ground as he shirks in pain scorching and steaming with burn mraks on his gills.

Godzilla gets back on his feet and turns to Destroyah, but Godzilla is quickly carried away by Gigan (the Mecha male M.U.T.O). Destroyah cackles at Godzilla.

Destroyah laughs in his triumph, Shimo's Dorsal plates light up and she fires a Absolute zero ray that shoots towards Destroyah's head, right as its about to strike he flies out of the way. Shimo misses and instead of Hitting Destroyah, it hits gigan (good thing too cause Gigan almost Killed Godzilla). the ray hits Gigan in the chest the freed Muto is sent flying and falls onto the ground seemingly unconscious from the impact.

the city is completely empty leaving nothing then just Shimo and destroyah, Shimo roars at destoroyah as they both charges towards each other. destoroyah cetchous her with a painful crystal attack and Shimo collapses to the ground, Kong Chagres up his body and unleashes an Electric Shock wave.

this frozen attack fazes over destoroyah and does nothing to him. destoroyah responds with his own weapon his white ghostly bolts of creaser light, Burn, cut, tare, and lift Kong into air giving a new meaning to the oxygen destroyer.

destoroyah grabs Kong by his tail and slams him all over the place through multiple buildings, Kong groans out in pain he's finally dropped to the ground. with burning hot flesh boiling out of his fur, his skin was beyond repair at this point. destoroyah lets out a viscous roar. he briefly takes the air and lands just as quickly at Kong's feet, Kong still blazing blue with electricity looks up at destoroyah. just like he did previously he forced his jaw on to Kong's heart causing it to bleed internally, Kong can only scream and foam in the mouth as destoroyah takes away his life form from his body.

Shimo who was unconsous from the pervious crystal was now awake patches of skin were now missing from her body. her left arm still damaged from the crystal and was suffering from some eternal bleeding despite being effected by it for a few seconds. she looks around and can't seem to located Godzilla or kong. she looks behind her and there they are. she can see them and she can hear Kong's cries of pain. Kong is lifted into the air and is being lintched by destroyah's tail siphoning his electricity while also freezing Kong's skin. Shimo needs to get destroyah off of Kong, having no other choice she charges into detroyah jumping into the air and forced her body onto destroyah knocking him down. Shimo can feel the crystal's power overwhelming her with Great pain, but she needs to bear through the pain.

Detroyah releases Kong and swings his left wing violently, His wing strikes shimo and she's knocked off of Destroyah . Godzilla gets back up and gets behind detroyah and violently pulls on his tail, Detroyah annoyed if anything, swings around and flings Godzilla into a near by building. detroyah charges to Godzilla nd impales his veteran slicer into Godzilla's belly (in the same spot), Godzilla roars in pain, then Godzilla flings him into the sky. Destroyah glides towards godzilla nd smashes him through a near by building. He can deal with a down Shimo later, he needs to finish off the King of the Monsters for Good.

and he'll have free range to kill of Kong. Kong's goal wasn't to beat down detroyah just yet, he was the distraction. just like he did earlier he attends to lead detroyah on a chase. detroyah relies Kong's tactic and decides not to give in to the chase. instead (destroayh types into his web browser to YouTube for his sponcer #¬†[r/Dangerville](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dangerville/)¬†\#¬†[r/fda](https://www.reddit.com/r/fda/)¬†. ) lets see, lets see, No No Ahh Here it is:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guJGjNlz7ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guJGjNlz7ew),¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RacvRDpSd4Y&t=544s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RacvRDpSd4Y&t=544s),¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcsnJmFj0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcsnJmFj0k), (subscribe to their channel))) focus his relenting force onto Godzilla.

Destroyah scrambles over to Godzilla if Kong wants to avert his attention to the main price its not going to work again. with destroyah picking up Godzilla with his tail he decides to siphon his energy while dragging him along the street smashing into many buildings. he then flings him into a near by air port and Godzilla crashes into a unused plane.

Kong realizes that this isn't going to work, he doesn't want to fight Destroyah one on one but Godzilla needs help. just then in the clouds, the noise sounds familiar, almost like mecha-godzilla but sounds nothing like him. the sounds rings out through out the sky. destroyah lets go of Shimo and flies into the clouds. he is then blasted back.

the Project¬†**Steel**¬†Phoenix nick named ""jet jaguar"" goes on lighting speed riming into detroyah sending him Barling into the ground.

Kong looks at this New ally and he realizes it was Trapper piloting the mech ""build this one my self, Big guy"" he says. Trapper had been secretly building this Mechanized suit from the remains of Mecha-godzilla.

Detroyah eventually gets back on his feet Kong and jet jaguar standing side by side with Shimo quirking following in line. before the battle can further commence, Jet jaguar unveils a giant Titan side syringe filled with with bluish-green liquid. Trapper had all sorts of gargets up his sleeve. knowing Kong was clearly unmatched in this fight he needed to give him a Boost.

jet injects the syringe into Kong his pupils dilate as nanites cover his body, a surge of energy shot into him coursing through his veins, kong has give strength, speed and durability inside this mechanised suit which he calls "" Mecha-Kong 2"" after Kong destroyed the pervious Mecha-Kong from the remains of the rival, Monarch to measures into their own hands.

right on Q Shimo recives her own change. Shimo begins to change texture her own dorsels start to melt the blue, purple and white she once dawned now turned into a Purple, Pink, orange, This was ""Hell-Frost Shimo"".

with the immense radiation of the crystals it seems Shimo would explode into an endless winter , but jia's life force hadn't left her just yet. She was able to control this radiation and channel it into a power that can Rival Destroyah. the Two roar at Detroyah, Detroyah Roars in unison, Jet jaguar puts his fist up and their ready to fight.

Kong chares in head first into destroyah and Shimo begins to charge her dorsal plates she reels back and a wide Blue heat ray with a spiral lining coursing though it directly hits detroyah, a hole is torn through Destroyah's wing , Destroyah scoffs and begins to regenerate, Except nothing happens the Spiral lining that Shimo Fired may not have done any severe damage but removed his one trump card his regeneration.

before Destroyah can even turn to look back at the Titan he feels a strong force rock his head Kong's punch dislocates Detroyah's jaw and snaps his neck, Detroyah reels back in pain.

destroyah may have been in a level of his own before but the combined power of Shimo, Kong, and jet jaguar had matched Destroyah's ferocity, jet jaguar lights up jet Boosters and draws a blade from his wrist. covered in yellow electricitythe blade digs deep into Destroyah's chest. Green slime sprang from his mouth.

Destroyah has had enough of this Game thier Playing, he needs to Even the odds once more, he makes a Large bittle cry and Hundreds and thousands of Destroyah agranents are here to Overwhelm the Titans.

with his entire body glowing bright red a pulse of the Oxygen Destroyer Explosion d√©tentes, knocking all three Titans back. jet's right arm has been severed off and his face is split in half almost reveling the Pilot.

Shimo face plants into the ground, But Kong is able to catch him self and touches down onto the ground, all three are in severe¬†**Agony.**¬†Blood streaks down Kong's face, Trapper is knocked to the wall head first and has a huge scar on his face, Shimo is kind of okay but is bleeding integrally. despite increased muscle density what ever Detroayh just did made it seem like he wasn't powered up at all.

However, they needed to stop Destroyah, he was far to Powerful in this state for there to be any mercy, Kong charges into battle and leaps onto Destroyah's head, Destroyah shakes violently trying to make him fall off.

the thundering Foot steps Go faster and Godzilla barrels into Destroyah, Destroyah is down on the ground with his back against them. he quickly turns around, Jet jaguar and Kong staring over him. as Jet leaps towards Detroyah, Detroyah quickly fires his Oxygen blast he lifts him high into the air. Destroyah is Done playing with his Food. with an extra surge of Energy they're all hurled a Good Distance.

if Detroyah can't regenerate by creating new cells anymore he'll have to take existing cells and channel them into his injuries. his left hand begins to shrink the length being cut by a fourth the tissue in his wing is transferred into the gaping hole that is his wing, now being filled with existing tissue, with Destroyah's wing regenerated he takes to the skies.

Shimo is sick with dealing with Destroyah, she lumbers towards him alone. Shimo is the Strongest she's ever been and she's going to finish off Destroyah once and for all. a hum is heard erupting from Shimo her dorsalis melt even further, Shimo channels all of her Might, power, and energy into one attack.

Jet takes notice and Grabs Kong and Godzilla activating his jet boosters and begins to fly away as fast as possible.

shimo Slams her foot into Destroyah's Chest, Destroyah tries to mimic the Blue Crystal again and casue Shimo Extreme pain like never before, her dorsal Dig into her flesh and mussels. the crystal is causing her so much pain, but she doesn't Care she is fed up with Destroyah. her back spewing out Frost, water and Radiation. as she has no dorsal left.

Destroyah attempts to shoot his oxygen blast but it has little effect, Shimo is only staggered as she continues slumber forwards towards Destroyah, despite her skin peeling off from her body, her flesh spewing our from her lips, neck and cheek. Destroyah channels more energy into his Oxygen blast but its off no use. Shimo is Only 100 m from Destroyah noticing that Shimo is far to powerful, he attempts to Explode a Paulse just like the Oxygen Destroyer, but he is too late as Shimo does her¬†**Final Attack**¬†and Shoots her Frostbite Blast Full Force into Destroyah's Mouth and with one final Roar Exchanged between the two Shimo Explodes into the New ice age.

a Massive avalanche, Snow Tsunami erupts from where once stood Shimo. Jet, Kong and Godzilla are still flying away but the Shock wave knocks them all to the ground. the wave of energy passes over them.

jet jaguar's amour breaks apart chunks flying everywhere, trapper falling to the ground full force knocking him unconscious. Kong's right arm is fully Frostbitten and he Shrieks in unimageable pain, Godzilla vomits up his last dinner.

the snow surrounds the area where once stood Shimo and Destroyah as the snow settles the two Alpha Titans make their way to where their former ally once stood. as they reach the area a Massive Mountain of ice maybe 1,000 feet High is left there. Shimo had scarified herself to take Destroyah down.

all that remained of Shimo was the skeleton of her her dorsal plates still visible, to the left of it the Horn of destroyah was the only thing in the ice.

Finally after the unbearable war of Death: the Destroyer of worlds, Destroyah was no more. both Kong and Godzilla look at each other and roar at the sky. Shimo's sacrifice wouldn't go to waste, the world was ridden of Destroyah.

Godzilla having nothing else to do retunes to where he came from,

Monarch had arrived to give aid to Kong's injuries, jet jaguar was barely functional and trapper airlifted him for repairs the World could now rest.

Epilogue:

Well after Shimo's death, Dr. llene Andrews walked into a facility and looked into a large glass tube, housing a baby Shimo, they didn't have a clear name for it but for now they'll call him ""Rhedosaurus"" in a hay nest surrounded by his eggshell. The baby gave a small, squeaking roar as he turned to look at his new owners.

This was Truly a ""Beast From 2,0000 fathoms""

In fact, I don't even have a printer yet. I was recommended Bambu by a colleague, then I saw how everyone else pretty much recommended Bambu printers. So, I started eyeing the P1S or X1C with tax return money coming, but saw that they are announcing a new model in the next couple of months so I decided to wait to see what that looks like.

Then Bambu's ""security updates"" entered the chat. I'll be honest, I don't know enough of the technical logistics to fully understand the back end, but enough to understand the theory of how this will be limiting to OrcaSlicer and potentially (despite what they say currently) lock down things even further or charge for subscriptions, especially with newer models.

***So, my question to those who know more, would it technically be possible to ""jailbreak"" Bambu printers to ""fix"" this?*** 

Of course, security and warranty would no longer be at play. I could see it being worth it, thinking back to the iPhone jailbreak days, and might be able to be ""restored"" to remove a jailbreak."

The headmaster seems very calm and willing to bend rules when it‚Äôs right morally. 
He takes over the exam when mash is being treated unfairly. He doesn‚Äôt expel mash when asked as he knows he was stopping a bullying tyrant. Though he does give a mild punishment. He is also the only character to accept mash‚Äôs goal of living in peace without ridiculing it. Even the other teachers during mash‚Äôs interview try to protest at mash‚Äôs answer but are silenced.
We know wahlberg has power he shows it in episode 2 with his test for mash. He then admits this was a test and he wants someone with good qualities to become Devine  visionary that year. So clearly he has power and is good and fair.

So given all that why doesn‚Äôt the headmaster stop Lang from bullying other students for coins. I mean granted he can‚Äôt be everywhere. 
I know one fight took place in a forest. Also Adler did have a secret arena. Nevertheless it has clearly been going on for long before mash arrived. We see a student from orca being beat up in a corridor. So it isn‚Äôt all out of sight. Also what about students who disappear like the puppets able makes students into? Surely the headmaster would have noticed something was up.
He could have put a stop to it all. Duelling is mentioned as being forbidden. He could have made it clear they had to earn coins honestly.
It would not have went down well but he would have the power as headmaster to enforce it.

Any ideas why  wahlberg didn‚Äôt step in?

The edge of the right half (which was the top of the build plate) of the base has pillowing or is really rough. The left edge had even further separation between the lines. And for some reason, the space in between the threads was perfect, closer and smoother than the rest of the surface.

What would cause the uneven result of the surface? My bed has auto-leveling, the sides and bottom are uniform and without issue, except for the most absolute minor lifting of a couple corner tips.

I will be running the SWX4PS1 via OctoPrint despite that it has Wi-Fi built in.  I had a second Raspberry Pi4 ready to use and all set up.  Thing is, the Pi 4 has USB-A outputs and the SWX4PS1 has only a USB-C and a USB-A input.

I live in the far north of Scotland...

Having posted this story previously on other subreddits, this story was accused of being fictional. However, the following events did in fact happen, regardless of if anything supernatural was/wasn't at play.*

I live in the far north of Scotland... Disturbing things have washed up ashore For the past two and a half years now, I have been living in the north of the Scottish Highlands - and when I say north, I mean as far north as you can possibly go. I live in a region called Caithness, in the small coastal town of Thurso, which is actually the northernmost town on the British mainland. I had always wanted to live in the Scottish Highlands, which seemed a far cry from my gloomy hometown in Yorkshire, England ‚Äì and when my dad and his partner told me they‚Äôd bought an old house up here, I jumped at the opportunity! From what they told me, Caithness sounded like the perfect destination. There were seals and otters in the town‚Äôs river, Dolphins and Orcas in the sea, and at certain times of the year, you could see the Northern Lights in the night sky. But despite my initial excitement of finally getting to live in the Scottish Highlands, full of beautiful mountains, amazing wildlife and vibrant culture... I would soon learn the region I had just moved to, was far from the idyllic destination I had dreamed of...

So many tourists flood here each summer, but when you actually choose to live here, in a harsh and freezing coastal climate... this place feels more like a purgatory. More than that... this place actually feels cursed... This probably just sounds like superstition on my part, but what almost convinces me of this belief, more so than anything else here... is that disturbing things have washed up on shore, each one supposedly worse than the last... and they all have to do with death...

The first thing I discovered here happened maybe a couple of months after I first moved to Caithness. In my spare time, I took to exploring the coastline around the Thurso area. It was on one of these days that I started to explore what was east of Thurso. On the right-hand side of the mouth of the river, there‚Äôs an old ruin of a castle ‚Äì but past that leads to a cliff trail around the eastern coastline. I first started exploring this trail with my dog, Maisie, on a very windy, rainy day. We trekked down the cliff trail and onto the bedrocks by the sea, and making our way around the curve of a cliff base, we then found something...

Littered all over the bedrock floor, were what seemed like dozens of dead seabirds... They were everywhere! It was as though they had just fallen out of the sky and washed ashore! I just assumed they either crashed into the rocks or were swept into the sea due to the stormy weather. Feeling like this was almost a warning, I decided to make my way back home, rather than risk being blown off the cliff trail.

It wasn‚Äôt until a day or so after, when I went back there to explore further down the coast, that a woman with her young daughter stopped me. Shouting across the other side of the road through the heavy rain, the woman told me she had just come from that direction - but that there was a warning sign for dog walkers, warning them the area was infested with dead seabirds, that had died from bird flu. She said the warning had told dog walkers to keep their dogs on a leash at all times, as bird flu was contagious to them. This instantly concerned me, as the day before, my dog Maisie had gotten close to the dead seabirds to sniff them.

But there was something else. Something about meeting this woman had struck me as weird. Although she was just a normal woman with her young daughter, they were walking a dog that was completely identical to Maisie: a small black and white Border Collie. Maybe that‚Äôs why the woman was so adamant to warn me, because in my dog, she saw her own, heading in the direction of danger. But why this detail was so weird to me, was because it almost felt like an omen of some kind. She was leading with her dog, identical to mine, away from the contagious dead birds, as though I should have been doing the same. It almost felt as though it wasn‚Äôt just the woman who was warning me, but something else - something disguised as a coincidence.

Curious as to what this warning sign was, I thanked the woman for letting me know, before continuing with Maisie towards the trail. We reached the entrance of the castle ruins, and on the entrance gate, I saw the sign she had warned me about. The sign was bright yellow and outlined with contagion symbols. If the woman‚Äôs warning wasn‚Äôt enough to make me turn around, this sign definitely was ‚Äì and so I head back into town, all the while worrying that my dog might now be contagious. Thankfully, Maisie would be absolutely fine.

Although I would later learn that bird flu was common to the region, and so dead seabirds wasn‚Äôt anything new, what I would stumble upon a year later, washed up on the town‚Äôs beach, would definitely be far more sinister...

In the summer of the following year, like most days, I walked with Maisie along the town‚Äôs beach, which stretched from one end of Thurso Bay to the other. I never really liked this beach, because it was always covered in stacks of seaweed, which not only stunk of sulphur, but attracted swarms of flies and midges. Even if they weren‚Äôt on you, you couldn‚Äôt help but feel like you were being bitten all over your body. The one thing I did love about this beach, was that on a clear enough day, you could see in the distance one of the Islands of Orkney. On a more cloudy or foggy day, it was as if this particular island was never there to begin with, and all you instead see is the ocean and a false horizon.

On one particular summer‚Äôs day, I was walking with Maisie along this beach. I had let her off her lead as she loved exploring and finding new smells from the ocean. She was rummaging through the stacks of seaweed when suddenly, Maisie had found something. I went to see what it was, and I realized it was something I‚Äôd never seen before... What we found, lying on top of a layer of seaweed, was an animal skeleton... I wasn‚Äôt sure what animal it belonged to exactly, but it was either a sheep or a goat. There were many farms in Caithness and across the sea in Orkney. My best guess was that an animal on one of Orkney‚Äôs coastal farms must have fallen off a ledge or cliff, drown and its remains eventually washed up here.

Although I was initially taken back by this skeleton, grinning up at me with its molar-like teeth, something else about this animal quickly caught my eye. The upper-body was indeed skeletal remains, completely picked white clean... but the lower-body was all still there... It still had its hoofs and all its wet fur. The fur was dark grey and as far as I could see, all the meat underneath was still intact. Although disturbed by this carcass, I was also very confused... What I didn‚Äôt understand was, why had the upper-body of this animal been completely picked off, whereas the lower part hadn‚Äôt even been touched? What was weirder, the lower-body hadn‚Äôt even decomposed yet. It still looked fresh.

I can still recollect the image of this dead animal in my mind‚Äôs eye. At the time, one of the first impressions I had of it, was that it seemed almost satanic. It reminded me of the image of Baphomet: a goat‚Äôs head on a man‚Äôs body. What made me think this, was not only the dark goat-like legs, but also the position the carcass was in. Although the carcass belonged to a goat or sheep, the way the skeleton was positioned almost made it appear hominid. The skeleton was laid on its back, with an arm and leg on each side of its body.

However, what I also have to mention about this incident, is that, like the dead sea birds and the warnings of the concerned woman, this skeleton also felt like an omen. A bad omen! I thought it might have been at the time, and to tell you the truth... it was. Not long after finding this skeleton washed up on the town‚Äôs beach, my personal life suddenly takes a very dark, and somewhat tragic downward spiral... I almost wish I could go into the details of what happened, as it would only support the idea of how much of a bad omen this skeleton would turn out to be... but it‚Äôs all rather personal.

While I‚Äôve still lived in this God-forsaken place, I have come across one more thing that has washed ashore ‚Äì and although I can‚Äôt say whether it was more, or less disturbing than the Baphomet-like skeleton I had found... it was definitely bone-chilling!

Six or so months later and into the Christmas season, I was still recovering from what personal thing had happened to me ‚Äì almost foreshadowed by the Baphomet skeleton. It was also around this time that I‚Äôd just gotten out of a long-distance relationship, and was only now finding closure from it. Feeling as though I had finally gotten over it, I decided I wanted to go on a long hike by myself along the cliff trail east of Thurso. And so, the day after Christmas ‚Äì Boxing Day, I got my backpack together, packed a lunch for myself and headed out at 6 am.

The hike along the trail had taken me all day, and by the evening, I had walked so far that I actually discovered what I first thought was a ghost town. What I found was an abandoned port settlement, which had the creepiest-looking disperse of old stone houses, as well as what looked like the ruins of an ancient round-tower. As it turned out, this was actually the Castletown heritage centre ‚Äì a tourist spot. It seemed I had walked so far around the rugged terrain, that I was now 10 miles outside of Thurso. On the other side of this settlement were the distant cliffs of Dunnet Bay, which compared to the cliffs I had already trekked along, were far grander. Although I could feel my legs finally begin to give way, and already anticipating a long journey back along the trail, I decided that I was going to cross the bay and reach the cliffs - and then make my way back home... Considering what I would find there... this is the point in the journey where I should have stopped.

By the time I was making my way around the bay, it had become very dark. I had already walked past more than half of the bay, but the cliffs didn‚Äôt feel any closer. It was at this point when I decided I really needed to turn around, as at night, walking back along the cliff trail was going to be dangerous - and for the parts of the trail that led down to the base of the cliffs, I really couldn‚Äôt afford for the tide to cut off my route.

I made my way back through the abandoned settlement of the heritage centre, and at night, this settlement definitely felt more like a ghost town. Shining my phone flashlight in the windows of the old stone houses, I was expecting to see a face or something peer out at me. What surprisingly made these houses scarier at night, were a handful of old fishing boats that had been left outside them. The wood they were made from looked very old and the paint had mostly been weathered off. But what was more concerning, was that in this abandoned ghost town of a settlement, I wasn‚Äôt alone. A van had pulled up, with three or four young men getting out. I wasn‚Äôt sure what they were doing exactly, but they were burning things into a trash can. What it was they were burning, I didn‚Äôt know - but as I made my way out of the abandoned settlement, every time I looked back at the men by the van, at least one of them were watching me. The abandoned settlement. The creepy men burning things by their van... That wasn‚Äôt even the creepiest thing I came across on that hike. The creepiest thing I found actually came as soon as I decided to head back home ‚Äì before I was even back at the heritage centre...

Finally making my way back, I tried retracing my own footprints along the beach. It was so dark by now that I needed to use my phone flashlight to find them. As I wandered through the darkness, with only the dim brightness of the flashlight to guide me... I came across something... Ahead of me, I could see a dark silhouette of something in the sand. It was too far away for my flashlight to reach, but it seemed to me that it was just a big rock, so I wasn‚Äôt all too concerned. But for some reason, I wasn‚Äôt a hundred percent convinced either. The closer I get to it, the more I think it could possibly be something else.

I was right on top of it now, and the silhouette didn‚Äôt look as much like a rock as I thought it did. If anything, it looked more like a very big fish ‚Äì almost like a tuna fish. I didn‚Äôt even realize fish could get that big in and around these waters. Still unsure whether this was just a rock or a dead fish of sorts ‚Äì but too afraid to shine my light on it, I decided I was going to touch it with my foot. My first thought was that I was going to feel hard rock beneath me, only to realize the darkness had played a trick on me. I lift up my foot and press it on the dark silhouette, but what I felt wasn't hard rock... It was squidgy...

My first reaction was a little bit of shock, because if this wasn‚Äôt a rock like I originally thought, then it was something else ‚Äì and had probably once been alive. Almost afraid to shine my light on whatever this was, I finally work up the courage to do it. Hoping this really is just a very big fish, I reluctantly shine my light on the dark squidgy thing... But what the light reveals is something else... It was a seal... A dead seal pup.

Seal carcasses do occasionally wash up in this region, and it wasn‚Äôt even the first time I saw one. But as I studied this dead seal with my flashlight, feeling my own skin crawl as I did it, I suddenly noticed something ‚Äì something alarming... This seal pup had a chunk of flesh bitten out of it... For all I knew, this poor seal pup could have been hit by a boat, and that‚Äôs what caused the wound. But the wound was round and basically a perfect bite shape... Depending on the time of year, there are orcas around these waters, which obviously hunt seals - but this bite mark was no bigger than what a fully-grown seal could make... Did another seal do this? I know other animals will sometimes eat their young, but I never heard of seals doing this... But what was even worse than the idea that this pup was potentially killed by its own species, was that this pup, this poor little seal pup... was missing its skull...

Not its head. It‚Äôs skull! The skin was all still there, but it was empty, lying flat down against the sand. Just when I think it can‚Äôt get any worse than this, I leave the seal to continue making my way back, when I come across another dark silhouette in the sand ahead. I go towards it, and what I find is another dead seal pup... But once more, this one also had an identical wound ‚Äì a fatal bite mark. And just like the other one... the skull was missing...

I could accept that they‚Äôd been killed by either a boat, or more likely from the evidence, an attack from another animal... but how did both of these seals, with the exact same wounds in the exact same place, also have both of their skulls missing? I didn‚Äôt understand it. These seals hadn‚Äôt been ripped apart ‚Äì they only had one bite mark each. Would the seal, or seals that killed them really remove their skulls? I didn‚Äôt know. I still don‚Äôt - but what I do know is that both of these carcasses were identical. Completely identical ‚Äì which was strange. They had clearly died the same way. I more than likely knew how they died... but what happened to their skulls?

As it happens, it‚Äôs actually common for seal carcasses to be found headless. Apparently, if they have been tumbling around in the surf for a while, the head can detach from the body before washing ashore. The only other answer I could find was scavengers. Sometimes other animals will scavenge the body and remove the head. What other animals that was, I wasn't sure - but at least now, I had more than one explanation as to why these seal pups were missing their skulls... even if I didn‚Äôt know which answer that was.

Although I had now reasoned out the cause of these missing skulls, it still struck me as weird as to how these seal pups were almost identical to each other in their demise. Maybe one of them could lose their skulls ‚Äì but could they really both?... I suppose so... Unlike the other things I found washed ashore, these dead seals thankfully didn‚Äôt feel like much of an omen. This was just a common occurrence to the region. But growing up most of my life in Yorkshire, England, where nothing ever happens, and suddenly moving to what seemed like the edge of the world, and finding mutilated remains of animals you only ever saw in zoos... it definitely stays with you...

For the past two and a half years that I‚Äôve been here, I almost do feel as though this region is cursed. Not only because of what I found washed ashore ‚Äì after all, dead things wash up here all the time... I almost feel like this place is cursed for a number of reasons. Despite the natural beauty all around, this place does somewhat feel like a purgatory. A depressive place that attracts lost souls from all around the UK.

Many of the locals leave this place, migrating far down south to places like Glasgow. On the contrary, it seems a fair number of people, like me, have come from afar to live here ‚Äì mostly retired English couples, who for some reason, choose this place above all others to live comfortably before the day they die... Perhaps like me, they thought this place would be idyllic, only to find out they were wrong... For the rest of the population, they‚Äôre either junkies or convicted criminals, relocated here from all around the country... If anything, you could even say that Caithness is the UK‚Äôs Alaska - where people come to get far away from their past lives or even themselves, but instead, amongst the natural beauty, are harassed by a cold, dark, depressing climate.

Maybe this place isn‚Äôt actually cursed. Maybe it really is just a remote area in the far north of Scotland - that has, for UK standards, a very unforgiving climate... Regardless, I won‚Äôt be here for much longer... Maybe the ghosts that followed me here will follow wherever I may end up next...

A fair bit of warning... if you do choose to come here, make sure you only come in the summer... But whatever you do... if you have your own personal demons of any kind... whatever you do... just don‚Äôt move here."

I live in the far north of Scotland... Disturbing things have washed up ashore,story,1i97iqp,2025-01-24 17:11:41,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1i97iqp/i_live_in_the_far_north_of_scotland_disturbing/,CosmicOrphan2020,Scary,"For the past two and a half years now, I have been living in the north of the Scottish Highlands - and when I say north, I mean as far north as you can possibly go. I live in a region called Caithness, in the small coastal town of Thurso, which is actually the northernmost town on the British mainland. I had always wanted to live in the Scottish Highlands, which seemed a far cry from my gloomy hometown in Yorkshire, England ‚Äì and when my dad and his partner told me they‚Äôd bought an old house up here, I jumped at the opportunity! From what they told me, Caithness sounded like the perfect destination. There were seals and otters in the town‚Äôs river, Dolphins and Orcas in the sea, and at certain times of the year, you could see the Northern Lights in the night sky. But despite my initial excitement of finally getting to live in the Scottish Highlands, full of beautiful mountains, amazing wildlife and vibrant culture... I would soon learn the region I had just moved to, was far from the idyllic destination I had dreamed of... ¬†

So many tourists flood here each summer, but when you actually choose to live here, in a harsh and freezing coastal climate... this place feels more like a purgatory. More than that... this place actually feels cursed... This probably just sounds like superstition on my part, but what almost convinces me of this belief, more so than anything else here... is that disturbing things have washed up on shore, each one supposedly worse than the last... and they all have to do with death...¬†

***They were littered everywhere***¬†

The first thing I discovered here happened maybe a couple of months after I first moved to Caithness. In my spare time, I took to exploring the coastline around the Thurso area. It was on one of these days that I started to explore what was east of Thurso. On the right-hand side of the mouth of the river, there‚Äôs an old ruin of a castle ‚Äì but past that leads to a cliff trail around the eastern coastline. I first started exploring this trail with my dog, Maisie, on a very¬†windy, rainy day. We trekked down the cliff trail and onto the bedrocks by the sea, and making our way around the curve of a cliff base, we then found something... ¬†

Littered all over the bedrock floor, were what seemed like dozens of dead seabirds... They were everywhere! It was as though they had just fallen out of the sky and washed ashore! I just assumed they either crashed into the rocks or were swept into the sea due to the stormy weather. Feeling like this was almost a warning, I decided to make my way back home, rather than risk being blown off the cliff trail.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until a day or so after, when I went back there to explore further down the coast, that a woman with her young daughter stopped me. Shouting across the other side of the road through the heavy rain, the woman told me she had just come from that direction - but that there was a warning sign for dog walkers, warning them the area was infested with dead seabirds, that had died from bird flu. She said the warning had told dog walkers to keep their dogs on a leash at all times, as bird flu was contagious to them. This instantly concerned me, as the day before, my dog Maisie had gotten close to the dead seabirds to sniff them.¬†¬†

But there was something else. Something about meeting this woman had struck me as weird. Although she was just a normal woman with her young daughter, they were walking a dog that was completely identical to Maisie: a small black and white Border Collie. Maybe that‚Äôs why the woman was so adamant to warn me, because in my dog, she saw her own, heading in the direction of danger. But why this detail was so weird to me, was because it almost felt like an omen of some kind. She was leading with her dog, identical to mine, away from the contagious dead birds, as though I should have been doing the same. It almost felt as though it wasn‚Äôt just the woman who was warning me, but something else - something disguised as a coincidence.¬†

Curious as to what this warning sign was, I thanked the woman for letting me know, before continuing with Maisie towards the trail. We reached the entrance of the castle ruins, and on the entrance gate, I saw the sign she had warned me about. The sign was bright yellow and outlined with contagion symbols. If the woman‚Äôs warning wasn‚Äôt enough to make me turn around, this sign definitely was ‚Äì and so I head back into town, all the while worrying¬†that my dog might now be contagious. Thankfully, Maisie would be absolutely¬†fine.¬†

Although I would later learn that bird flu was common to the region, and so dead seabirds wasn‚Äôt anything new, what I would stumble upon a year later, washed up on the town‚Äôs beach, would definitely be far more sinister...¬†

***It looked like the devil***¬†

In the summer of the following year, like most days, I walked with Maisie along the town‚Äôs beach, which stretched from one end of Thurso Bay to the other. I never really liked this beach, because it was always covered in stacks of seaweed, which not only stunk of sulphur, but attracted swarms of flies and midges. Even if they weren‚Äôt on you, you couldn‚Äôt help but feel like you were being bitten all over your body. The one thing I did love about this beach, was that on a clear enough day, you could see in the distance one of the Islands of Orkney. On a more cloudy or foggy day, it was as if this particular island was never there to begin with, and all you instead see is the ocean and a false horizon.¬†

On one particular summer‚Äôs day,¬†I was walking with Maisie along this beach. I had let her off her lead as she loved exploring¬†and finding new smells from the ocean. She was rummaging through the stacks of seaweed when suddenly, Maisie had found something. I went to see what it was, and I realized it was something I‚Äôd never seen before... What we found, lying on top of a layer of seaweed, was an animal skeleton... I wasn‚Äôt sure what animal it belonged to exactly, but it was either a sheep or a goat. There were many farms in Caithness and across the sea in Orkney. My best guess was that an animal on one of Orkney‚Äôs coastal farms must have fallen off a ledge or cliff, drown and its remains eventually washed up here.

Although I was initially taken back by this skeleton, grinning up at me with its molar-like teeth, something else about this animal quickly caught my eye. The upper-body was indeed skeletal remains, completely picked white clean... but the lower-body was all still there... It still had its hoofs and all its wet fur. The fur was dark grey and as far as I could see, all the meat underneath was still intact. Although disturbed by this carcass, I was also very confused... What I didn‚Äôt understand was, why had the upper-body of this animal been completely picked off, whereas the lower part hadn‚Äôt even been touched? What was weirder, the lower-body hadn‚Äôt even decomposed yet. It¬†still looked fresh.¬†

I can still recollect the image of this dead animal in my mind‚Äôs eye. At the time, one of the first impressions I had of it, was that it seemed almost satanic. It reminded me of the image of Baphomet: a goat‚Äôs head on a man‚Äôs body. What made me think this, was not only the dark goat-like legs, but also the position the carcass was in. Although the carcass belonged to a goat or sheep, the way the skeleton was positioned almost made it appear hominid. The skeleton was laid on its back, with an arm and leg on each side of its body.¬†

However, what I also have to mention about this incident, is that, like the dead sea birds and the warnings of the concerned woman, this skeleton also felt like an omen. A bad omen! I thought it might have been at the time, and to tell you the truth... it was. Not long after finding this skeleton washed up on the town‚Äôs beach, my personal life suddenly takes a very dark, and somewhat tragic downward spiral...¬†I almost wish I could go into the details of what happened,¬†as it would only support the idea of how much of a bad omen this skeleton would turn out to be... but it‚Äôs all rather personal.¬†

While I‚Äôve still lived in this God-forsaken place, I have come across one more thing that has washed ashore ‚Äì and although I can‚Äôt say whether it was more, or less disturbing than the Baphomet-like skeleton I had found... it was definitely bone-chilling!¬†

***What happened to the skulls?***¬†

Six or so months later and into the Christmas season, I was still recovering from what personal thing had happened to me ‚Äì almost foreshadowed by the Baphomet skeleton. It was also around this time that I‚Äôd just gotten out of a long-distance relationship, and was only now finding closure from it. Feeling as though I had finally gotten over it, I decided I wanted to go on a long hike by myself along the cliff trail east of Thurso. And so, the day after Christmas ‚Äì Boxing Day, I got my backpack together, packed a lunch for myself and headed out at 6 am.¬†

The hike along the trail had taken me all day, and by the evening, I had walked so far that I actually discovered what I first thought was a ghost town. What I found was an abandoned port settlement, which had the creepiest-looking disperse of old stone houses, as well as what looked like the ruins of an ancient round-tower. As it turned out, this was actually the Castletown¬†heritage centre ‚Äì a tourist spot. It seemed I had walked so far around the rugged terrain, that I was now 10 miles outside of Thurso. On the other side of this settlement were the distant cliffs of Dunnet Bay, which compared to the cliffs I had already trekked along, were far grander. Although I could feel my legs finally begin to give way, and already anticipating a long journey back along the trail, I decided that I was going to cross the bay and¬†reach the cliffs - and then make my way back home... Considering what I would find there... this is the point in the journey where I should have stopped.¬†

By the time I was making my way around the bay, it had become very¬†dark. I had already walked past more than half of the bay, but the cliffs didn‚Äôt feel any closer. It was at this point when I decided I really needed to turn around, as at night, walking back along the cliff trail was going to be dangerous - and for the parts of the trail that led down to the base of the cliffs, I really couldn‚Äôt afford for the tide to cut off my route.¬†

I made my way back through the abandoned settlement of the heritage centre, and at night, this settlement definitely felt more like a ghost town. Shining my phone flashlight in the windows of the old stone houses, I was expecting to see a face or something peer out at me. What surprisingly made these houses scarier at night, were a handful of old fishing boats that had been left outside them. The wood they were made from looked very old and the paint had mostly been weathered off. But what was more concerning, was that in this abandoned ghost town of a settlement, I wasn‚Äôt alone. A van had pulled up, with three or four young men getting out. I wasn‚Äôt sure what they were doing exactly, but they were burning things into a trash can. What it was they were burning, I didn‚Äôt know - but as I made my way out of the abandoned settlement, every time I looked back at the men by the van, at least one of them were watching me. The abandoned settlement. The creepy men burning things by their van... That wasn‚Äôt even the creepiest thing I came across on that hike. The creepiest thing I found actually came as soon as I decided to head back home ‚Äì before I was even back at the heritage centre...¬†

Finally making my way back, I tried retracing my own footprints along the beach. It was so dark by now that I needed to use my phone flashlight to find them. As I wandered through the darkness, with only the dim brightness of the flashlight to guide me...¬†I came across something... Ahead of me, I could see a dark silhouette of something in the sand. It was too far away for my flashlight to reach, but it¬†seemed to me that it was just a big rock, so I wasn‚Äôt all too concerned. But for some reason, I wasn‚Äôt a hundred percent convinced either. The closer I get to it, the more I think it could possibly be something else.¬†

I was right on top of it now, and the silhouette didn‚Äôt look as much like a rock as I thought it did. If anything, it looked more like a very big fish ‚Äì almost like a tuna fish. I didn‚Äôt even realize fish could get that big in and around these waters. Still unsure whether this was just a rock or a dead fish of sorts ‚Äì but too afraid to shine my light on it, I decided I was going to touch it with my foot. My first thought was that I was going to feel hard rock beneath me, only to realize¬†the darkness had played a trick on me. I lift up my foot and press it on the dark silhouette, but what I felt wasn't hard rock... It was squidgy...¬†

My first reaction was a little bit of shock, because if this wasn‚Äôt a rock like I originally thought, then it was something else ‚Äì and had probably once been alive. Almost afraid to shine my light on whatever this was, I finally work up the courage to do it.¬†Hoping this really is just a very¬†big¬†fish, I reluctantly shine my light on the dark squidgy thing...¬†But what the light reveals is something else... It was a seal... A dead seal pup.¬†

Seal carcasses do occasionally wash up in this region, and it wasn‚Äôt even the first time I saw one. But as I studied this dead seal with my flashlight, feeling my own skin crawl as I did it, I suddenly noticed something ‚Äì something alarming... This seal pup had a chunk of flesh bitten out of it... For all I knew, this poor seal pup could have been hit by a boat, and that‚Äôs what caused the wound. But the wound was round and basically a perfect bite shape... Depending on the time of year, there are orcas around these waters, which obviously hunt seals - but this bite mark was no bigger than what a fully-grown seal could make... Did another seal do this?¬†I know other animals will sometimes eat their young, but I never heard of seals doing this... But what was even worse than the idea that this pup was potentially killed by its own species, was that this pup, this poor little seal pup... was missing its skull... ¬†

Not its head. It‚Äôs skull! The skin was all still there, but it was empty, lying flat down against the sand. Just when I think it can‚Äôt get any worse than this, I leave the seal to continue making my way back, when I come across another dark silhouette in the sand ahead. I go towards it, and what I find is another dead seal pup... But once more, this one also had an identical wound ‚Äì a fatal bite mark. And just like the other one... the skull was missing... ¬†

I could accept that they‚Äôd been killed by either a boat, or more likely from the evidence, an attack from another animal... but how did both of these seals, with the exact same wounds in the exact same place,¬†also have both of their skulls missing? I didn‚Äôt understand it. These seals hadn‚Äôt been ripped apart ‚Äì they only had one bite mark each. Would the¬†seal, or seals that killed them really remove their skulls? I didn‚Äôt know. I still don‚Äôt - but what I do know is that¬†both of these carcasses¬†were identical. Completely identical ‚Äì which was strange. They had clearly died the same way. I more than likely knew how they died... but what happened to their skulls?¬†

As it happens, it‚Äôs actually common for seal carcasses to be found headless. Apparently, if they have¬†been tumbling around in the surf for a while, the head can detach from the body before washing ashore. The only other answer I could find was scavengers. Sometimes other animals will scavenge the body and remove the head. What other animals that was, I wasn't sure - but at least now, I had more than one explanation as to why these seal pups were missing their skulls... even if I didn‚Äôt know which answer that was.¬†

Although I had now reasoned out the cause of these missing skulls, it still struck me as weird as to how these seal pups were almost identical to each other¬†in their demise. Maybe one of them could lose their skulls ‚Äì but could they really both?... I suppose so... Unlike the other things I found washed ashore, these dead seals thankfully didn‚Äôt feel like much of an omen. This was just a common occurrence to the region. But growing up most of my life in Yorkshire, England, where nothing ever happens, and suddenly moving to what seemed like the edge of the world, and finding mutilated remains of animals you only ever saw in zoos... it definitely stays with you...¬†

For the past two and a half years that I‚Äôve been here, I almost do feel as though this region is cursed. Not only because of what I found washed ashore ‚Äì after all, dead things wash up here all the time... I almost feel like this place is cursed for a number of reasons. Despite the natural beauty¬†all around, this place does somewhat feel like a purgatory. A depressive place that attracts lost souls from all around the UK. ¬†

Hi everyone. I made a model in blender that once i import in Orca slicer the thread does not slice (image 6). using the inbuilt repair tool in Orca causes Image 7-8. The thread seems to be fine in blender and before slicing and there does not seem to be any major issues with the vertices that i can see. The thread however was made in blender by importing an stl of a thread and using it to boolean my model as i hate making threads in blender. If anyone could let me know how to fix this that would be greatly appreciated.

Print Farm Owners: Affected by Bambu firmware?,OpenBambu,1i95sr5,2025-01-24 15:57:22,5,0.65,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBambu/comments/1i95sr5/print_farm_owners_affected_by_bambu_firmware/,BIGLEAKS,,"I have read all the nonsense from r/BambuLab and from what I have collected:

\- We won't have access to Panda Screen for P1S (bummer)

\- Orca won't work like before (personally never needed to use orca so doesnt affect me now)

  
How else will it affect me/ my farm I owned 4 X1C and 4 P1S and looking to buy more printers. 

\- I hear speculations that this will open doors to subscription-based cloud service and only being able to use Filament from Bambu and no other brands.  

And many more concerns from the community but, I would like to hear FEEDBACK from other small and large Bambu print farm owners who have there own reasonable take on this firmware update drama. 

Thanks

Orca Barrel Mount Loose,fosscad,1i95mx6,2025-01-24 15:50:17,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosscad/comments/1i95mx6/orca_barrel_mount_loose/,johnjr08,,"I printed a Hoffman Orca 15 upper in Polymaker PET-CF and the clamshell barrel mounts slide in/bottom out inside the upper easily with just gravity, no pushing or hammering. Seems like the hole in the upper that the barrel mounts go into is slightly too large.

  
I've calibrated everything and I'm using the barrel mounts from Hoffman's kit. I previously printed the upper in PLA and that one had a nice snug fit, but this PET-CF one is quite loose.

  
Any suggesstions on what I should try or settings to adjust if I have to re-print the upper? I'm using OrcaSlicer if that matters."

Should I try OrcaSlicer?,BambuLab,1i95d3x,2025-01-24 15:38:42,6,0.72,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1i95d3x/should_i_try_orcaslicer/,Infinity-onnoa,Show & Tell,"I have been using the x1c for 6 months now and I am truly delighted with the use of BambuStudio, it allows me to print, leave the house and monitor and control the printer from work, it came from an Artillery x1 and Cura Slicer‚Ä¶ needless to say that the change is abysmal.  Honestly, until now I had only considered changing the X1Plus Expander board due to the Ethernet issue (I hate using WiFi), but it bothered me to modify the firmware while it was under warranty. 

After the latest events on the part of Bambu, it makes me rethink many things... I only read good things about OrcaSlicer, and I am revealing myself... I value stability a lot, I have been using Osx since 2006 and iOS since the beginning, and I went from an Artillery x1 +Cura Slicer to Bambu for the same reason as from Windows XP to Osx, for simplicity and stability. 

Now I'm considering buying the x1 board and using Orca but...is there a way to block the updates without losing control of the printer and the liveview?


What am I missing in Orca?"

Any suggestions? For reference I have an A1 with AMS .

Got a AD5M and an AD5M Pro.

Both are having issues printing PETG, both print PLA just fine. Stock .4mm nozzles. Have done multiple clean pulls on each. Pressure advance calibration on the AD5M gave best results at 0.56, on the AD5M Pro was 0.52 - lines were 100% clear/straight at those settings.

Using Overture and ELEGOO variants - opened two new Overture today fresh out of the bag, threw one in the heater for 6 hours, did one straight from the sealed package.

Everything prints just horribly. Using the stock flashforge generic PETG setting on a PEI plate. Set speeds for first layer to just 50 and first layer infill of 80 to go super slow - same results. 

Results are also around the same for the Pro with the enclosure opened and close - no real difference. Watching the temps, they never fluctuate when printing.

I stopped it early as each time it progresses past this is starts to rip them up and just make a further mess.

Thoughts? Thanks!

EDIT - Oh, I also have a P1S and it's printing the same PETG without issue. Took the roll off the non-pro and put it into the P1S (also using Orca not Bambu Studio) and used the generic PETG there - prints no issue, so filament is good."

Adhere NFC stickers on all your filament. Build an ESP32 OpenSpool reader and place it next to your printer. Touching the filament to the reader will automatically update your Bambu Printer filament settings. Almost as seamlessly as if you were using Bambu filament with an AMS.
