Favorite musings in ENO,eno,1i9xe0j,2025-01-25 16:21:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/eno/comments/1i9xe0j/favorite_musings_in_eno/,cferrari22,,"Watching Eno, there were so many cool ideas and insights into his body of work, but I especially appreciated some of the “big ideas”. These were nice reminders for me on what happened to be my first day of retirement. Here are my favorites paraphrased, what are yours?

* (musing on why we like music, why some notes feel right together)…Music gives us a sense of being synchronized, with being part of something bigger; it satisfies that very human need.
* Sex, drugs, art, and religion are the times we most often surrender ourselves, and actually enjoy letting go of our egos. He suggested rethinking surrender as a strategy that one can use in creating art.
* As an artist, he is challenged every morning to decide “what am I going to do today? Of all the things in the world, what am I going to do?” Lunch is high on his list :)
* Art creates a situation where people can have feelings and examine them. That's enough.
* Each person is like a modem in a vast network of brains, and depends on everyone else’s expertise. He believes art can bridge that gap, both vertically and horizontally. We can share art, horizontally, such as in a concert, or vertically, such as when we read something and do something else with that knowledge."

Ještě donedávna lidé neměli příliš na výběr - pokud chtěli využívat sociální sítě, museli si vybrat jednu z těch největších. Facebook, Instagram nebo X ale začínají bojovat s čím dál větší konkurencí v podobě nezávislých a decentralizovaných sítí. V poslední době zaujala třeba sociální síť Bluesky. A nyní k ní přibude obdoba Instagramu s názvem Flashes.\
\
Obě tyto sítě, tedy Bluesky a Flashes, přitom používají otevřený protokol AT Protocol a jsou tedy doslova otevřené. A není náhodou, že spolu budou i propojené. Zatímco Bluesky funguje podobně jako Facebook, Flashes zase bude novou konkurencí pro Instagram. A Mark Zuckerberg, jakožto majitel obou z nich, by na to mohl doplatit odlivem uživatelů ke konkurenci.\

What if one day you woke up and could float above your bed just by thinking about it? Or discovered during a swim that you could breathe underwater? Or even accidentally lifted a car while running late for work? That’s the kind of strange, new normal the people of Elias Island are dealing with every day.

It all started after an earthquake in 2016 that shook the small island off the coast of Maine.

At first, it was easy to write things off as odd little flukes, but before long, nearly everyone began noticing strange things. Powers they didn’t ask for and abilities they can’t always control. The residents have been left to figure out how their lives fit into this new reality, while some are ready to test their limits, others are determined to act like everything’s fine.  
Spoiler alert: nothing is ever fine on the island.

Things have only become more odd as time passes by!

Welcome to /r/TheArchetypes,TheArchetypes,1i9wuea,2025-01-25 15:57:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArchetypes/comments/1i9wuea/welcome_to_rthearchetypes/,Mikey-506,,"Welcome to r/TheArchetypes, a community where science, psychology, and mythology converge to explore the intricate frameworks of human identity. Here, we delve deep into the *Archetypes*—Witches, Androids, and Mystics—distinctive lenses through which we can understand diverse neurological, emotional, and cognitive landscapes.

Each archetype represents a fusion of ancient metaphors and modern neuroscience, offering profound insights into personality, potential, and the challenges of living as a uniquely wired human being. This introduction sets the stage for a captivating journey into these archetypes and the dynamic interplay of neurotransmitters, hormones, and human experience.

# The Witches: Alchemists of Emotion

The Witches are the fiery souls driven by emotional depth, creativity, and heightened sensitivity to internal and external stimuli. They thrive in the realm of intuition, channeling their emotional intensity into profound artistic, spiritual, or problem-solving pursuits. Yet, their volatility makes them vulnerable to mood disorders like Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.

# Core Traits

* Emotional Intensity
* Creative Expression
* Intuitive Connections

# Associated Neurotransmitters & Challenges

* **Dopamine:** Amplifies highs (mania) and lows (depression).
* **Serotonin:** Often deficient, leading to mood instability.
* **Norepinephrine:** Drives emotional reactivity during stress.

# Strengths

* Transformative creativity and resilience.
* Profound empathy and interpersonal understanding.
* Ability to turn chaos into innovation.

**Grounding practices**, Schumann Resonance frequencies (7.83 Hz), and mindfulness are essential tools for balancing their tumultuous energy.

# The Androids: Masters of Logic and Structure

Androids excel in systematic thinking and thrive on logic, precision, and routine. Representing high-functioning neurodivergence, they stabilize the emotional turbulence of Witches and ground the abstract musings of Mystics. Androids embody the brilliance of order but may struggle with sensory sensitivities and social integration.

# Core Traits

* Logical and Analytical
* Detail-Oriented
* Anchoring Stability for Others

# Associated Neurotransmitters & Challenges

* **Glutamate:** Heightened levels amplify sensory overload.
* **Dopamine:** Often dysregulated, affecting focus and motivation.
* **Serotonin:** Fluctuates, influencing mood and impulsivity.

# Strengths

* Exceptional problem-solving skills.
* Acute attention to patterns and details.
* The stabilizing force in chaotic systems.

Tools like sensory modulation, structured routines, and dietary support rich in Omega-3s and magnesium help Androids manage challenges and thrive.

# The Mystics: Visionaries of the Abstract

Mystics perceive the world through a kaleidoscope of abstract thought, visionary insight, and altered perceptions. Often linked to high-functioning schizophrenia or related conditions, Mystics push the boundaries of conventional understanding, diving deep into philosophy, creativity, and spirituality. However, their disconnection from practical reality can be both a gift and a challenge.

# Core Traits

* Visionary Thinking
* Abstract Connections
* Profound Intuition

# Associated Neurotransmitters & Challenges

* **Dopamine:** Excessive in some pathways, enhancing imagination but fostering delusions.
* **Glutamate:** Overactivity contributes to overstimulation.
* **GABA:** Deficits heighten anxiety and sensory reactivity.

# Strengths

* Pioneering abstract connections and innovative ideas.
* Resilience in navigating complex inner worlds.
* Deep spiritual and philosophical understanding.

Grounding meditation, structured routines with flexibility, and oxytocin-enhancing social activities help Mystics balance their gifts with reality.

# The Neuroscience of the Archetypes

Each archetype is a dynamic interplay of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, and hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin​. This intricate web explains shared patterns across archetypes, such as dopamine dysregulation in Witches and Mystics or serotonin deficits in Androids​​​.

By understanding these biochemical signatures, we can better navigate their strengths and challenges, creating tailored strategies for growth and harmony.

# Your Role in r/TheArchetypes

This subreddit invites you to:

* Share personal stories and reflections.
* Explore practical tools for thriving within your archetype.
* Discuss the connections between mythology, psychology, and neuroscience.
* Dive into the 3D network of neurotransmitter and hormone interplay.

Let this community be a haven for curiosity, growth, and connection. Whether you're a Witch crafting emotional alchemy, an Android engineering order from chaos, or a Mystic uncovering the secrets of the universe, you're not alone. Together, we can embrace the beauty of our archetypes and the diversity they bring to the human experience.

Let the exploration begin!"

My Star Trek Re-Marathon: DS9 Season 4,startrek,1i9wj2s,2025-01-25 15:43:31,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1i9wj2s/my_star_trek_remarathon_ds9_season_4/,Sci-FiStorybook,,"Hi, back again with the next part of my Star Trek re-marathon. Just to say, because I forgot again, my favourite episode from VOY S1 was Caretaker: an excellent premiere. But now we're back onto DS9, and just to reiterate: everything is just my opinion, and spoilers for all Star Trek. Also this post is very long, so thank you very much for putting up with that!

**The Way of the Warrior**

After the haunting reveal of the Changelings being 'everywhere' at the end of S3 we see the Alpha Quadrant convulsing with fear over shapeshifting infiltration. This double-length season premiere truly has it all. The excellent introduction of Worf, whose joining DS9 feels like the natural next step for his character, combines with the Klingons entering as a major player into DS9's political landscape, as the big Alpha Quadrant powers start taking especial notice of the Dominion. I just love the Klingons being proper antagonists in Star Trek again. The story of their invasion of Cardassia is gripping, with huge impacts both for Worf personally and the Alpha Quadrant more widely. The Cardassians also play a valuable role in this, as we get the rather good news of a recent democratic revolution, but also see them forced onto the backfoot by the Klingons. I would also like to say that it blows my mind on a rewatch that this Martok is actually a Changeling. I mean, WOW. This episode has superb political intrigue, absolutely epic action sequences, and brilliant character stuff. **10/10**

**The Visitor**

And yet this episode, half the length, manages to be even better. Seeing Jake losing himself after his father's 'death', and how he goes to the most extreme lengths to get him back, is so heartrending. Cirroc Lofton does a fantastic job, and then Tony Todd really steals the show. The final scene between the two of them is so emotionally acted, I can't even. 'Jake, *no*!' And then Sisko goes back and embraces his son, knowing now what lengths Jake would truly go to for him. Certifiably my favourite episode of the season. **10/10**

**Hippocratic Oath**

Another early look at the Jem'Hadar, and while they are truly terrifying to me, this episode also does a great job of making you feel sorry for them. It's not their fault they're programmed to be brutish killers, and this one Jem'Hadar is (to a significant extent), questioning what he's been engineered to believe. You completely understand both Julian's and Miles' points of view. While Julian is inhabiting Starfleet's ideals, Miles ultimately makes the depressing, realistic call to save himself and his friend. The rupture in their relationship and the death of all those Jem'Hadar that result are so very weighty. **9/10**

**Indiscretion**

We start to see another side to Dukat, but we're never quite allowed to forget his inhumane side. I do love how they humanise him here, with his love for a dead Bajoran and the amusing, warming scene where he sits on a spike. Side by side with this is his continued insistence on how the Occupation (and himself) were 'good for Bajor'. And of course, the fact that he was going to kill his daughter. I really don't know if Dukat would have pulled the trigger or not had Kira not been there to influence him: I'm not sure he would have but I'm also not sure he *wouldn't* have. But he does in the end make a loving decision all the same. We see Dukat humanised, but we're never allowed to forget his foul side. **9/10**

**Rejoined**

A lovely, ultimately heartbreaking tale of love across traditional boundaries. Obviously the fact that it's two women isn't what's 'unacceptable' in the 24th Century, but making it a lesbian relationship adds a real-world edge to the narrative about two people who love each other kept apart by the cruel strictures of their society. I also do love the sci-fi dynamic, of two Trill reconnecting with someone from a past life. So lovely and so upsetting, especially at the end. **10/10**

**Starship Down**

Brilliant ensemble piece. Tense naval action at the beginning followed by an exciting exploration of several different paths on the Defiant. Really enjoy them all, honestly, but my favourites would have to be Kira trying to keep Sisko, her friend and her Emissary, awake, and Quark debating the finer points of business with a Karemma. **9/10**

**Little Green Men**

Hilarious twist on the army-finds-UFO trope. The misunderstandings, the deliberate deceptions: all brilliant. I love Quark being both shocked and enchanted by 1940s Earth, and his complete disregard for any temporal implications of his actions. And the Nurse character's optimism about a spacefaring future is infectious: no wonder Gene Roddenberry was able to get TOS made! **9/10**

**The Sword of Kahless**

I remembered not liking this one so much, but I really enjoyed it this time! It portrays the power that history and the thirst for triumph can have on people, as two honourable Klingons devolve into jealous, rageful beasts over the titular Sword. Very clever how a 'unifying symbol' can actually divide people precisely because of its cultural importance. **9/10**

**Our Man Bashir**

A hilarious, loving, mocking tribute/send-up of old James Bond films. Every actor is clearly having a blast in their roles, and my particular plaudits must go to Avery Brooks for nailing it as an insane Bond Villain, and Terry Farrell for playing a stereotypical submissive female character who's so ludicrously unlike Jadzia. And Garak's disbelief over what Julian thinks is spying is so funny. **9/10**

**Homefront/Paradise Lost**

DS9's superb Secret Invasion storyline intensifies, in a 2-parter that subverts everything Part 1 set up in Part 2. We're very aware as viewers of the threat the Founders pose, and are very much on Sisko and co's side when they pressure the President of the Federation into declaring martial law. But then the threads start getting unpicked in Part 2 and we see how fear of infiltration can make even members of the best of organisations (Starfleet) go against everything they stand for. And also, fantastic to see Cadet Nog at the Academy, and Sisko's dad rocks. And finally, the Changeling threat isn't *denied*: take that terrifying scene with the Changeling O'Brien. But it's made clear that paranoia like this is so destructive. **10/10**

**Crossfire**

Oh, *Odo*! My heart breaks for you. You see how much he adores Kira: the way he prepares every little detail for their meetings together. But he just can't muster the courage to say anything. Seeing him become more and more distracted, losing focus on his job, is a whirlwind of pain for the character. And then Quark, disguising his worry for his friend as concern for his business, gives him the best advice possible. And Odo still can't bring himself to say anything, totally understandably: he just starts trying to leave his love for Kira to the side. **9/10**

**Return to Grace**

The fascinating relationship between Kira and Dukat is furthered, as the latter learns terrorist tactics from the former in order to fight the Klingons. Again, we see Dukat's good side (his genuine love for his daughter) and his negative qualities. The way he blows up the Klingons with zero mercy, for example. Ziyal is also a superb character: so kind and gentle, and seeing her father as a good and great man at this point. **9/10**

**Sons of Mogh**

Heartfelt ending for Kurn's story. He's been a powerful presence ever since he first beamed aboard the Enterprise, and it's good to see that Worf's actions at the beginning of the season had consequences. There truly doesn't seem to be any way out for Kurn, and in the end Worf can only offer him a way that robs him of his brother. **9/10**

**Bar Association**

Ferengi episodes are usually comedies: hilarious mickey-takes of capitalism. While this episode is still very much a comedy, it is also very serious and very dark. Brunt was legitimately terrifying, as he conveyed the true viciousness of Ferengi society, in the ways he tried to crush the strike. This episode is also huge for Quark and Rom's relationship: a real rupture comes between them as Rom rejects Ferengi ideals, nearly causing his brother's death. In the end they do largely make up, although there's still an undercurrent of division. Then Rom caps off his arc for the episode: he finally breaks from his brother's shadow, and with Ferengi values, when he becomes an engineer. A masterpiece. **10/10**

**Accession**

By the Prophets, the hits just don't stop rolling! Sisko has a long-running arc of broadening his Starfleet perspective, through how his view of the Prophets changes, and in his acceptance of his role as their Emissary. Through him the audience (myself certainly) experiences an expansion of their perspective. We've always been led to believe, because we see things through a Starfleet lens, that the Wormhole Aliens are just alien entities, worshipped by the Bajorans as Gods. They have no actual connection to Bajor. But this episode gets across that they do have a connection to Bajor: they say they are 'of Bajor'. It's not saying they're definitely Gods, but it does highlight the possibility, and certainly says they're potentially a lot more than what Sisko, and we the audience, initially thought they were. And the entire reason Sisko went and saw the Prophets again was because he was concerned about the impact the 'true Emissary' was having on Bajor, which he has come to care about greatly. So... is he not demonstrating that he is becoming 'of Bajor' as well? An absolutely brilliant episode that challenged what I thought was possible when I watched it (part of DS9 turning me from atheist to agnostic), as it challenges what Sisko thinks is possible, and gets him to start accepting his role as Emissary. **10/10**

**Rules of Engagement**

Courtroom episodes are normally a good bet, and this is no exception. It's fascinating to see a Klingon who's not a warrior in the traditional sense: he knows how Klingons work, and he manipulates all their values to get a rise out of Worf. Klingons can be genius political manoeuvrers as well as soldiers. The shots they do of the crew being back in their memories, but still talking to the camera, are also cool as hell. And the eventual revelation of the Klingons' deception is amazing. **9/10**

**Hard Time**

Yes, I know it's a bit unbelievable that this never gets brought up again. But it was such an emotional experience that I couldn't help but adore it. What Miles goes through is truly traumatic, and his inability to adjust to normal life again, coupled with his flashbacks to killing his friend, are so hardgoing. The climax, after he nearly hits Molly, and then considers committing suicide because he hates what he's become, is the crowning glory of the episode. Colm Meaney absolutely shines in that final scene, and seeing our man the Chief broken like that is unbearable. Alexander Siddig also does a fine job of playing Julian calm and compassionate: he's grown up a lot and is a true friend to Miles. **10/10**

**Shattered Mirror**

The best DS9 Mirror Universe episode for sure. It uses DS9's concept as a political nexus, but for the Mirror Universe. And it couples this great compression of DS9's concept with an emotional story of Sisko and Jake having to see Jennifer die again. And I will also say that Mirror Garak being on a golden chain held by Mirror Worf is legendary. **9/10**

**The Muse**

OK, I suppose we had to have a bad one eventually. I will say that I do feel a genuine connection between Odo and Lwaxana that is quite sweet. But beyond that this episode is a disaster on both its fronts: the pregnancy storyline is contrived and hammy and adds more story for Lwaxana where none was needed after Dark Page. And the Jake storyline is just bizarre. **2/10**

**For the Cause**

An episode that does more with how complex a moral quandary the Maquis represent. You really don't want Kasidy to be helping them for Sisko's sake, but you totally understand why she does. It's a very moving story. Then we have the absolute shocker of Eddington's betrayal. He was built up as such a mild-mannered, dull character that this completely stuns you. It's an excellent twist. His parting speech about why the Federation don't understand the Maquis, because they elected to leave it, strikes a chord, even if ultimately felt angry towards Eddington. **9/10**

**To the Death**

We get our most gripping look yet at how the Jem'Hadar function as warriors: brutally but with their own sense of duty. And we see how they operate under the Vorta with the honeyed tones, Weyoun, played with malevolent relish by the amazing Jeffrey Combs. He's so polite and soft-spoken most of the time, but then you get flares of his true, vicious nature. It's a tense journey aboard the Defiant for most of the runtime, concluding in an exciting action sequence and the death of Weyoun... well, one of them. **9/10**

**The Quickening**

What a masterful episode of Star Trek. Julian has a long arc of maturing and growing up. There's no single moment where he flips from naivety to maturity, of course, but this is the closest thing. He arrogantly believes he can cure a truly horrible sci-fi disease, and ends up making things worse. But he doesn't give up: he learns humility and comes back to try even harder, with much less optimism about succeeding. When he delivers his friend's baby, and the last thing she sees is that he doesn't have the Blight... so astoundingly moving. Even if their lives remain shrouded in the threat of death, Julian gave them a beacon of hope, growing up a hell of a lot in the process. **10/10**

**Body Parts**

A second, still very comedic, but also very dark, Ferengi episode. Quark is backed into a deadly corner by Ferengi practices, but is fervently committed to proving that he is a traditional Ferengi, after all his family have shown themselves to be renegades. But in the end he realises he shouldn't go through with it, and we get a truly heavy scene where Brunt strips him of his Ferengi business licence and all his possessions. And then we get an equally uplifting scene where all his friends come in to help him rebuild. Oh, and Kira has Miles' and Keiko's second baby beamed into her womb, which is very weird but ends up a not totally useless storyline. **10/10**

**Broken Link**

Odo faces a fearsome reckoning for being the first Changeling to ever harm another. The Founders' decision to turn him into a solid, reflecting how he in their minds chose the solids over his own people, is truly harrowing for Odo, who confessed in The Die is Cast that he wanted nothing more than to be back among his own kind. Now he has been forcibly kicked out. Horrendous. And the final kicker that Gowron has been replaced by a Changeling is nothing short of a phenomenal cliffhanger. **10/10**

**Season Review**

Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I freaking LOVED this season. It is my favourite season of Star Trek so far in my rewatch. It intensifies the threat of the Dominion through Changeling infiltration, and has all the Alpha Quadrant species, from the Klingons to the Federation, scrambling in fear of this Secret Invasion. But there's also a lot more than this running thread: we get what are in my view the greatest Ferengi critiques of capitalism, that manage to be hilarious and terrifying all at once, we get Sisko's Starfleet mentality expanded as he becomes more and more 'of Bajor', and we get countless other great comedies, romance stories, and philosophical episodes. What an absolutely cracking season. **S Tier**

That's all! Thank you so so much for reading this, and please tell me your thoughts on this season! I love writing these posts and love interacting with people. As Gowron would say: Glory to you, and your House!"

Final update: BIL confessed he had feelings for me after wedding dress shopping with his fiance.,u_No-Poet-4293,1i9w3i5,2025-01-25 15:24:09,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Poet-4293/comments/1i9w3i5/final_update_bil_confessed_he_had_feelings_for_me/,No-Poet-4293,,"Hi everyone! I posted this first on the Two Hot Takes subreddit, and a few updates on my account since they all kept getting taken down by mods, and I wanted to share a final update as I’m still getting notifications from them. For some context, I am 27f, my husband is 28m, BIL is 32m and his fiance is 29f. This started as a throwaway account but now it’s just an anonymous account, and this will likely be my last update regarding this story. 

Since this happened we have talked and my BIL has explained some of his feelings as he has understood so far thanks to a lot of introspection and therapy. The silver lining to all of this is that he is spending some much needed time working through his feelings and coping mechanisms. 

He group texted me and my husband and asked if we could talk together, it was mostly to talk to me, but he didn’t want there to be any grey area going forward. To sum it up, he very sincerely apologized to me for the position he put me in and to both of us for the betrayal of our relationships. After a couple therapy sessions talking through his root feelings, he realized how terrified of change he was, even when it was good, and frankly his fear of a failed marriage. He was older and understood so much more of his parents divorce than my husband and he didn’t realize how much that impacted him because he had pushed it down so deep. 

My husband and I had met before my BIL met his fiance and in the early days, he had an attraction to me. But he pushed these feelings away because obviously, I was with his brother. 

When he found his fiance he truly fell in love with her, and we all knew it by the way he acted. I mean this guy is usually stubborn and stoic, but he just melted for her. He changed so many habits (for the better) for her sake and for his future. Nobody questioned if he loved her and he was so excited to propose, albeit he knew he was nervous for the life change.  
When we went out dress shopping and came back, a little tipsy and excited, she just gushed to him about wedding details and ideas and he got overwhelmed. So he did a couple shots (not saying it was a good choice but it’s the one he made) and when I came out, as a person he had come to for comfort or advice on more than one occasion, he just exploded and said what he said. 

He had so many thoughts running through his head and I can’t say I’m that mad at him for what happened. When I got engaged, no matter how much I loved my husband and how great our marriage is now, I have to admit I had a few late night musings about what life would be like married because it should not be taken lightly. 

He was so genuine in his apology and ashamed of his thoughts and actions, he was damn near in tears. When his brother hugged him he lost it. I gave him a hug as well and he couldn’t stop thanking us for not just telling him to F off. 

His fiance joined us after our talk and she said that while she’s still struggling with trusting him and they aren’t going to get married on the same timeline they were planning, she’s not leaving him as long as he continues to work on his feelings and unpacks his emotions around marriage. They go to couples therapy and both go individually as well and I think we all see a road forward, knowing it will not be easy. 

In my past posts, there were so many people who thought my BIL was making it up to get out of it, and he would have a thrown away his relationship for me. Call me crazy, or naive, but I don’t see it that way and nobody else involved does either. We addressed the possibility, and dismissed it. 

I appreciate the level of care people have shown for me and my future SIL, and we will continue to show care for her and my BIL as they navigate this together. "

I'm curious if artists have Rafayel as their main. As an artist, I think the first thing that drew me to him was how colourful he was. He was the only one with an unnatural hair colour and eyes (that's before I saw Caleb's eyes) plus he was painting in the teaser trailer so I just automatically latched on to him. I stopped playing the game for a while because of uni and came back because of the many videos of Sylus I saw on TikTok, only to be smitten with Rafayel all over again. Yes, I started liking Xavier and Zayne more but then I kept coming back to Rafayel because of how poetic he is. I'm drawn to his beauty. His personality is beautiful, his lore (although sad) is tragically beautiful and he just radiates an energy that is overall so refreshing and wonderful. He inspires me. He's my muse now. I'm pretty sure if he were real, I'd have fallen in love with him already. I thought my attraction to him was because we're both artists but now I'm kind of curious if there are any artists out there who aren't drawn to him in the slightest."

Trying to go for a weekly chapter for this, but we'll see if this has legs.

\---

**Morning**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Sheriff Reynard Mueller heaved a sigh, his gaze sweeping over the pearl-grain fields stretching out before him. The multitudes of stalks, heavy with ripe grain, appeared to shimmer in the sunlight as they swayed in the breeze. An idyllic pastoral scene common to Caedwyn Realm, the sort of sight that soothed Reynard's nerves in trying times, whether it was back in his days as a conscript in the Nexian legions, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier.

Reynard turned his gaze slightly to the right, the simple movement immediately souring his mood. Another plot of pearl-grain came into sight, but it was a far cry from the pristine view Reynard was admiring moments ago. A series of large and intricate patterns had been trampled into the field, as if it had been stamped by a giant branding iron from the heavens. The patterns were not confined to a single plot, but instead extended to several neighboring plots as well.

Worse still, the culprit behind the defaced fields had not been content to limit their mischief to the Burley farm. Similar patterns had been spotted out on the plains, grazing grounds, and even in the deep forest. As ever, the rumormongers were having a grand time speculating on the nature and intent of these mysterious markings. These myriad theories ranged from bored pranksters to foreign saboteurs. Even sinister beings from old folk tales were pointed to as the culprits. 

To add more kindling to the blaze, there had also been sightings of what folk were calling 'hexfire', strange and distant lights that danced in the sky with a speed and agility that did not match any creature or conveyance known to Caedwyn. Even worldly men like Reynard, who had served in the Nexian military in distant Realms, were at a loss to explain the bizarre occurrences. In the middle of this confusion, Reynard and the constabulary labored to carry out their duties. Looking to the mercifully clear skies, the Sheriff wondered if this was only the beginning of his troubles.

As if summoned by his dark mood, the angry thudding of hooves reached Reynard’s ears. That would be Eamon Burley, owner of this farm, no doubt ready to give him an earful about what an outrage this all was. Eamon was a gentleman who took it upon himself to voice his opinions at full volume, lest the world be deprived of his valuable insights. “Ah well, nice while it lasted,” muttered Reynard, bidding silent farewell to the lovely view, and turning to face Eamon.  
“Didn’t take half of forever to get here, did you, Mueller?” bellowed the irate farmer.  
“Good day to you too, Eamon,” greeted Reynard drily. “Steady on now, no sense in calling down the legions just yet.”  
“Hah! As if soldiers would be worth a damn for this mischief! There’s strange magic afoot!” said Eamon, gesturing to the defaced plot of pearl grain behind him.  
“Strange magic? How do you reckon that, Eamon?”  
Eamon leaned in and whispered conspiratorially to Reynard. “It’s dark business, I’m telling you. I’m no mage, but I did get a bit of the Sight from my blessed mother, and I didn’t feel one bloody bit of mana stirring during the whole commotion! How’s that possible, I ask you?”  
“That is a bit odd,” admitted Reynard. “Better off asking Dara about that sort of thing. She arrived ahead of me, didn’t she?”  
“Ah, Deputy Shelly, good egg that one, bright girl. Came up here with that wildman of yours in tow, she did.”

Reynard scowled at the epithet. While Meadowfolk and Woodfolk were branches of the same tree, they were often at odds with each other, given their differing ways of life. That estrangement had only deepened with the ongoing Nexian Reformations, which favored the Meadowfolk. The Nexians considered the Meadowfolk to be ‘more civilized’ than their ‘backward’ cousins, and some Meadowfolk had taken it to heart, branding the Woodfolk as ‘wildmen’.  
“Rabbit does honest work for the constabulary, Eamon. No need for that kind of talk.”  
“Pfah, what’s the lie in calling him a wildman, with his antlers looking like a tangle of brambles, and all that poppycock dangling from them?”  
“No lie at all, Farmer Burley,” Rabbit interjected suddenly, emerging from both men’s blind spots, as if appearing out of thin air.

To his credit, Reynard only flinched in surprise, while Eamon let out an undignified yelp. Rabbit stood before them, clad in his usual mottled leathers and woodsman’s gear. While Eamon’s description of Rabbit’s antlers was uncharitable, there was a kernel of truth to it. Woodfolk let their antlers grow free and untrimmed, favoring asymmetry, and decorated them with all manner of charms and talismans. The result was a vibrant mess that they proudly wore like crowns, a stark contrast to the well-trimmed and modestly decorated antlers of the Meadowfolk.

“Morning Sarge, Farmer,” greeted the smirking ranger. Most of the local Woodfolk had taken to calling Reynard ‘Sarge’ due to former military rank. Woodfolk were odd like that with names. By their reckoning, ‘Sarge’ was a name with real power behind it, a title earned by blood and deed. Not quite up to Nexian standards of professionalism, but things were a bit more relaxed out in the frontier realms.  
“Morning, Rabbit. Starting the day with a bit of stalking practice?” Reynard replied, pretending to not have been taken by surprise.  
""Oh, I weren't even trying. Easy work, coming up quiet on someone when their mind’s looking elsewhere,"" drawled Rabbit. ""But that’s not the story you want, so I’ll tell you the other. I was up on the roof, getting light prints of the mess in the fields. Dara’s out there having a closer look. Also spotted a bit of sheep track heading out to the grasslands.”  
“Oh! Right, I damn near forgot, I–”  
“Should come along so we can find those poor blighters and get them safely home. Fair plan, right?” Eamon could only mumble in agreement as Rabbit led him off to track down his lost sheep. Reynard tipped an imaginary cap to Rabbit in thanks. 

**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**  
**Survey Station Selene, Observation Deck**

Senior Technician Cristian Mendez heaved a sigh, taking in the stunning view from the observation deck. A vast starfield stretched out before him, a dazzling array of celestial jewels glittering against the cold void of space. The station was located on the dark side of Caedwyn’s moon, meaning planet-rise wasn’t visible to them, but Mendez preferred starfields anyway. “Sure is pretty out there. Damn shame it’s a damn death trap,” he thought aloud. Someone chuckled behind him. “Kinda like deep sea facilities, y’know? Surrounded by wonder and mystery that’ll kill you dead if you stepped out into it,” they commented.

Mendez turned to see Drone Operations Specialist Joseph Anders, his coworker and long-time friend. “More or less, yeah. At least we get bigger windows,” he replied, waving to Anders.  
“Flying drones are cooler than submersibles too, if you ask me,” said Anders, handing Mendez a cup of coffee.  
“Speaking of, wanna head to the Ops Center? Next flight is in 30, with a new rotation. Might be better to get there early to make sure the prep’s done right,” suggested Mendez, tilting his head in the direction of the Remote Drone Operations Center.  
“Damn, that’s right, double rotations after the brass went on the warpath. Let’s hop to it, then.” 

The pair set off to their workplace, sipping their drinks while continuing their conversation. “How’d that debrief go, by the way?” asked Anders. Earlier in the day, Mendez had gone through a marathon of a debriefing with the higher-ups, covering the system-wide glitch that caused all the commotion planetside. It was a dubious reward for not only being the ‘first responder’ to the whole mess, but also managing the ensuing damage control and cleanup operations.  
“You know how it goes, good work gets rewarded with more work,” answered Mendez, which got a nod of understanding from Anders. He continued, “On the plus side, they were all ears when I outlined the cleanup and retrieval plans, and they seem to be on board with playing things safer now.”  
“I’ll say they’re on board,” agreed Anders, grinning. “Word is that the computer janitors who screwed up are getting extra special attention from an oversight committee. Plus, total rollback of automated systems, manual operation with max supervision for all missions going forward.”  
Mendez nodded, his expression hardening. “About damn time. We’ve been over-reliant on the locals’ ignorance of Earth tech to stay invisible. These folks aren’t stupid. Give ‘em enough clues, and they’re gonna figure out what to look for, and where. Throw all that magic bullshit into the mix and we’re a coin flip away from our work becoming damn near impossible. High time we got back to playing it safe and using our damn heads.”  
“Look at you, all responsible and shit. Relax, all the code monkeys and their shiny toys got sent packing. We’re calling the shots until the dust settles,” reasoned Anders, which got a shrug from Mendez.  
“Yeah, I suppose that’s something. After we put out these fires, we can start pushing for some sane best practices. Speaking of cleanup though, I’ve got some plans that I need to go over with you.”  
Anders raised an eyebrow. “That sounds like more work, Cris. I already got an entire wing of drone jocks to babysit.”  
“Yeah, but this is about scooping up all the physical evidence and covering our tracks, including the stuff the locals might have in lockup. Just a big ol’ heist movie, figured you might be interested, buddy.”  
“Well shit, you know just how to bait that hook, dontcha? All right boss, lemme hear this cleanup plan of yours…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

With Rabbit keeping Eamon occupied, Reynard was free to seek out his deputy, Dara Shelly. If anyone would be able to make head or tail of this bedlam, it would be her. Dara’s meticulous nature and arcane expertise made her well suited for the task. Her mana aptitude pushed the boundaries of the gifted commoners, but sadly fell short of the admissions requirements of the regional Academy of Magical Arts. It was the Academy's loss, by Reynard's reckoning. Dara had a keen mind in addition to her arcane talents, and had proven time and again to be a valuable member of the constabulary. If those gilded robes at the Academy failed to see her worth, they could go boil their heads for all he cared.

Looking around, Reynard spotted a woman with short-cropped red hair and severely trimmed antlers walking about the fields, taking notes and collecting samples. ""Hoi, Dara! Find anything?"" he called out as he approached her.  
""Nothing of note. Well, compared to all of this,"" She was standing in a perfect circle of trampled stalks, one of many that scarred Burley's fields. Beyond the circles were also concentric  rings, equally precise, as well as myriad geometric shapes, all connected by lines of varying width. Dara made a sweeping gesture, explaining, ""Same as all the other reports, a series of intricate patterns, joined by these straight lines in an irregular loop.""  
""Hm, looks like they were going in circles when they trampled the grain,” said Reynard, looking at the way the flattened pearl-grain lay on the ground. “Some kind of ritual, then?"" he asked.  
Dara shook her head in response. ""No, ritual magic requires consistent invocation patterns, but these are too haphazard. It’s all a jumble of circles, rings, and lines. If it’s following a pattern, it’s not an arcane one.""  
""Well, Nexian magic needs regular patterns anyway,"" Reynard mused. ""But it doesn't look like Druidic magic either. Druid runework is all... wibbly-wobbly, right?"" Reynard wiggled his fingers for emphasis, earning a scowl from Dara.  
""All wibbly-wobbly? Honestly Sheriff, would it kill you to use proper terminology?"" she grumbled. ""Technically you're right, though. This isn't anything like the vine and bough patterns of Woodfolk ritual magic,"" she continued. ""It's exceedingly strange. All of the individual parts of the pattern are remarkably precise. But when taken as a whole, they're complete nonsense,"" muttered Dara to herself.  
""Well there you go, we'll put a warrant out for an insane geometer with improbably large tools,"" joked Reynard.  
“Academicians run amok, may His Eternal Majesty deliver us,” deadpanned Dara in response. They shared a chuckle as Dara continued taking measurements and samples.

Reynard took a closer look at the trampled stalks while speaking to Dara. On its own, it was simple enough to figure out. Something heavy had come along and crushed the stalks flat. A group of strong youths with a wooden beam and a length of rope could have done the job, probably. No, what made this such a mystery was how swiftly the culprits had managed to do their work so swiftly in so many places, seemingly all at the same time. There was also the matter of the witnesses swearing up and down that they neither saw nor felt any spellwork being woven during the incidents. “It is a bit odd though, that nobody with the Sight felt any magic during all this commotion,” mused Reynard.   
Dara huffed. “Don’t get me started on the nonsense that’s been going around,” she growled. “Can you imagine? Something of the size they described going airborne without the aid of magic?” Dara shot to her feet and jabbed a finger skyward. “Not just airborne, mind you, but so high up the ‘hexfire’ blinked out, like it shot past the bloody Tapestry!”  
Reynard stifled a laugh, and ventured, “So you’re saying it’s not too likely this was something mundane?”

He swore she’d start shooting plumes of fire from her eyes, from the look she was giving him. As the constabulary’s most mana-gifted member, Dara did tend to get into a lather about the particulars of the magical arts. This hexfire business in particular was doing her head in, what with damn near everything about the incidents defying common sense. Dara took a deep breath, looking like she was about to let loose with a rant, but then thought better of it and slowly exhaled instead.   
“Right then, I’m not saying the witnesses are lying, or that they’re necessarily wrong,” she began, reining in her frustration. “The issue is that it’s irresponsible to fall back on fantastical notions like manaless artifices, as if mundane forces could somehow rival the power of mana. Just because you don’t see the mana fields moving, doesn’t mean you can just throw out the fundamental order of the world,” she explained.  
Reynard nodded. “It’s as you often say, nothing happens in contradiction to the natural order,” he began.  
“They are merely in contradiction to what we currently know of the natural order, exactly,” she finished, smiling. “Sounds like you’ve been paying attention to my ‘unofficial lectures’ at least,” she added with a laugh.  
“Contrary to popular belief, I can be taught,” quipped Reynard with a wry grin. “But getting back to the issue. If there is magic at play, but nobody sensed it, what’s the more reasonable explanation? Some kind of concealment?”  
“Concealment is one option we can look into. You see, according to current literature…”

**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**   
**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

""Hey Mendez, check it out, it's Sheriff Rey-Rey and my homegirl Dara!"" said Anders excitedly, pointing to an infil-drone video feed of the Sheriff and his deputy. As persons of interest in the ongoing cleanup operations, the constabulary were under regular surveillance most of the time, and as such enjoyed minor celebrity status among the drone operators.  
""Christ, Anders. They're not a bunch of hypernet streamers, can the parasocial crap,"" replied Mendez.  
""Look, I'm a simple man. I see a redhead, I subscribe.""  
""Like you’ve got a shot, fanboy. Anything new with the law?""  
""Still the usual bagging and tagging of evidence, and interviewing witnesses. Basic police work, by the book stuff. Sheriff Rey, Dara, and Rabbit are scoping out the Burley farm, and we’ve got Baldie and Socks checking out a livestock mutilation out on the plains.”  
“Hm. And the Sheriff already swung by Splitskull?”  
“Yep, though he only dealt with Gladys’ goons, not the Hag herself. Her Ladyship was busy with other matters, apparently, and there was no sign of her outside,” explained Anders.  
“Shit, that can’t be good. The geological survey drone came back with a couple worms missing, didn’t it?” asked Mendez, referring to the burrowing sample collector robots that the survey drones deployed to take core samples over a given area.  
“Unfortunately, yeah. How much you wanna bet ol’ Gladys got her claws on one of ‘em?”  
“One of ‘em? That old bitch has got her half of the mountain sewn up tighter than a Vac-U-Seal bag. She’s gotta have snagged both, no question.”  
“All right, what kind of money you got on the failsafes actually working?”  
“So what if they did? The electronics and servos would be slagged, but that still leaves them with a bunch of goodies to play with. Space-age alloys, precision machined parts, hell, the cutting heads on those things alone would probably make ‘em shit a brick.”  
“Welp, better start brainstorming on what we’re gonna do for Operation Claim Jumper…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia**

A few minutes' ride from the Burley farm, Constables Daruth Val’Ged and Elwin Redfoot, better known as Baldie and Socks, were performing their duties in the wake of the hexfire’s rampage. They were currently investigating another incident site, similar to the others but with an alarmingly grisly difference: an eviscerated sheep lay splayed out in the middle of the strange pattern pressed into the plains grass. Socks was currently investigating the carcass. He was no stranger to gore, being a huntsman, but the display still managed to unnerve him with how bizarre it was. 

While he wasn’t the best student of magic, nothing he saw here resembled any of the rituals from the elders’ teachings. It didn’t even look like outlander magic, like what the Nexians used. The body itself harbored more mysteries. Scavengers had gnawed and mangled it some, shifting some parts from where they once sat, but a proper look revealed more. Scorch and puncture marks no wider than a knitting needle dotted the body, whether by chance or intent, he couldn’t say. The body had been cut open long before the vermin had gotten to it, surely with a magical blade. That was the only tool that could have left such clean and neat edges on flesh and bone alike. 

As for the innards, it looked like the culprit took their pick of the organs, snatching up the heart, liver, left kidney, and a good arm’s length of guts. The stomachs were cast to the side, each one punctured and emptied for gods only knew what reason. Socks couldn’t tell if this phantom butcher was a master or a madman. Whatever the culprit’s nature, Dara would definitely want to take a closer look at this. Weighing his options, he elected to bag up the carcass as evidence, seeing as carrion eaters had already run roughshod all over the scene. He silently cursed himself for not asking for the wagon.

Behind him, Baldie was interviewing Old Hob, the shepherd who had apparently witnessed the incident, but Baldie had serious doubts about that. He was trying his best to not let the cranky old cuss embarrass himself, but he was having quite the time of it. “All right Hob, let’s see if I’ve got this right,” began Baldie, his brow furrowed in consternation. Hob glared back at him. “You were out late at night, rounding up some strays that got loose, when suddenly some… thing–”  
""It were them witch-lights, a whole swarm of ‘em! I told you thrice already!”  
“Right, so down they come, shining light in your eyes. After blinding you, they snatch up the strays and leave you out on the plains.”  
“Aye, I sent up a signal too, but you lawmen showed up all slow like!”  
“We were busy, Hob. You weren’t the only one with… troubles last night,” countered Baldie. “In any case, by the time the night watch arrived, the strays had come back to you. So what’s all the fuss about, then?”  
“They’re marked by the hexfire, they are! A dark pall hangs o’er them!”  
“And that’s why you decided to shear them down to the bare hide?”  
“Well, how else was I s’posed to reveal the dark marks?”

Baldie glanced over at the shorn sheep. If they were in the thrall of some otherworldly force, they weren’t showing it. They were currently grazing on a patch of clover, blissfully unaware of the drama unfolding around them, making Baldie feel a pang of envy. Socks approached to join them, having completed the bloody business of packing up the evidence. He spoke to Hob while wiping his hands off on a rag.   
“Keep your velvet on, Hob. How about this, we’ll bring ‘em to the chattel physick to take a look-see. If he gives the all clear, you have to take ‘em back, and if something’s amiss, we’ll square away the price with you. All right?”  
“Whatever suits you, just get ‘em away from me. I don’t feel safe, knowing they’re watching me for their dark master. Who knows what they’re plotting?” hissed the old man, shaking his fist at the sheep. Baldie and Socks looked at the still oblivious animals, grazing away without a care in the world, then back to Hob. They were clearly unimpressed.

“They’re unclean, I tell you! Unclean!” insisted Hob, jabbing his finger at one of the supposed agents of the dark powers.

As if on cue, the sheep farted. Baldie and Socks remained unimpressed.

**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

“Goddammit,” said Mendez with a tired sigh, watching Baldie and Socks on the screen as they led away their newly acquired sheep. “So we got three tracker-tagged sheep literally getting booked by the cops. What the hell is a ‘chattel physick’? Some kind of country vet or something?”  
“Yeah, a vet for farm animals, if I remember right. We’ve probably got a file on the guy and where his place is at. I’ll include it in the mission prep materials. Are we running a mission to get ‘em back?”  
“Depends. What did the drone stick ‘em with? Standard tracker, or a full on sensor package?”  
Tapping on his keyboard, Anders scanned his screen for the information. “Looks like they got the fauna biometrics tracking suite,” he said, wincing. He rattled off the specs, “Six low profile capsules, four subdermal, two intramuscular.”  
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” lamented Mendez, cradling his head in his hands. “The hell kind of retrieval mission do we fly for something like this?”  
“Aren’t you the one who said it’d be like a big ol’ heist movie? Think of it as a challenge! I can see it now, The Great Mutton Caper!”  
“*No manches* Mutton Caper! I oughta make mutton outta you, *cabron*,” grumbled Mendez.  
“Aw c’mon, look on the bright side, we’ll know exactly where they are at any given time, thanks to the trackers. That’s more than we can say for those missing driller bots,” replied Anders with a grin. 

Mendez remained unamused.

**Late Evening**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Miller’s Hollow, Municipal Guardhouse**

Reynard looked up from his ledger, glancing around the guardhouse offices. Flanking him were Baldie and Sam, busy with a stack of reports each. The three of them were handling paperwork, compiling witness testimonies for filing later. Dara and Socks were examining the animal remains and other perishable items. Rabbit and Belkund were in the evidence locker, tagging and sorting the rest of the items. They had burned every minute of daylight gathering everything they could in the wake of the hexfire sightings, and that was only half the job done. Now they had to attend to teasing apart the tangled account of events, and knit it back into a coherent and orderly telling. That’s what the Administratum would demand, and Reynard fully understood the risks of defying this expectation. 

The Nexian officials staffing the Administratum would be especially displeased with how the strange events seemed to be reviving old superstitions. Phrases like 'hexfire' were remnants of the past, rooted in the old magics of the realm, before the Nexians papered over the 'backward superstitions of ignorant rustics' with more civilized magical arts. The Nexians were accustomed to a newrealm’s old ways retreating to the margins of history, while the Nexus busily penned new chapters with grand, sweeping strokes.

Such gusto often placed a great deal of pressure on the local populace and their leaders. So far, the Nexians were content to push their Reformations at a gradual but steady pace. But Reynard knew their patience would not last forever. Soon enough, they would become much more insistent and far less polite. His time in the military taught him just how insistent and impolite the Empire could be. Not wanting to dwell further on such thoughts, Reynard busied himself with his paperwork once more.

He had a long shift ahead of him."
