"Reuploaded: Risk adjusted return for most top 500 coins, and portfolio risk adjusted return calculator. (Information ratio, similar to Sharpe ratio)",leafypineglass,zqsw76,2022-12-20 11:34:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leafypineglass/comments/zqsw76/reuploaded_risk_adjusted_return_for_most_top_500/,leafypineglass,Coin Selection Strategy,"Posted with the wrong username, re-posting with the correct one.

**Intro, skippable if seen previous posts:** The Information Ratio is a way to look at risk adjusted return. It's returns divided by volatility, but with extra steps for comparing with a benchmark. An asset might have a lot more gain and but only a bit more risk, or the other way around. With the portfolio calculator, just copy to your google drive and enter the symbols and percentages.

Common uses:

* Gaining more insight into a coin/token;
* Comparing coins/tokens of a similar risk level;
* More common with portfolios than single asset.

Higher number is better, negative number is worse than benchmark. High IR can still be too risky/not risky enough for your preference.

Not all coins in top 500 have been around for a full year, so there's a table done with the last 6 months of data. The benchmark used is [CCI30](https://cci30.com/), the crypto index.

# Thoughts

Half year data is *probably* more useful for short term investments.

Low risk cryptocurrencies had a narrower range of 30 day returns.

Idk why VERI has a volatility of 10948620551561000000000000000000000000. But the math checks out.

Exchange tokens are often near the top of the low risk group, with CRO barely entering med risk.

&#x200B;

# Methodology

The formula for IR is: (AssetReturn - BenchmarkReturn)/TrackingError

Tracking Error is StandardDeviation (DailyReturn - DailyBenchmarkReturn).

Calculations were batch done with a script I wrote.

Data for coins come from Coin Gecko API.

Coins with missing days were removed.

[More about IR](https://www.styleadvisor.com/resources/statfacts/information-ratio)

**Disclaimers**

Not financial advice.

High IR doesn't necessarily mean they will perform well in the future.

Idk what most of these coins/tokens are.

I'm personally not using this data as sole deciding factor in anything."

Not just FTX Token: Solana price nukes 40% along with other ‘Sam coins’,expay24,yqlzoh,2022-11-09 10:24:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/yqlzoh/not_just_ftx_token_solana_price_nukes_40_along/,Expay-24,,"Solana ([SOL](https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index)) is on the track to log its worst daily performance on record.

On Nov. 9, SOL’s price dropped more than 40% to around $16 primarily due to its association with Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto-focused hedge fund Alameda Research and cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

_SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_
Sam tokens get ‘fried’
----------------------

Fried was an early investor in the Solana blockchain project via Alameda Research. On Nov. 8, the entrepreneur’s estimated wealth [](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-tumbles-off-bloomberg-s-billionaire-index-after-trouble-at-ftx)[plunged from a whopping $15.6 billion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-tumbles-off-bloomberg-s-billionaire-index-after-trouble-at-ftx) to around $1 billion, [according](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/) to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

At the core of this wipeout was a [near-collapse of FTX](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-announces-intent-to-acquire-ftx-to-help-cover-the-liquidity-crunch). On Nov. 6, Binance, FTX’s rival exchange and early investor, decided to sell its $2 billion stake, which it was holding in the form of FTX’s native token, FTX Token ([FTT](https://cointelegraph.com/ftx-token-ftt-price-index)). In response, FTT’s price crashed by over 85% and was trading for around $3.60 as of Nov. 9.

Alameda Research’s balance sheet reportedly was worth around $12 billion as of June 30, out of which half was FTT. The firm allegedly had $8 billion in liabilities on the same day, raising speculation about its potential insolvency after FTT’s massive crash.

As a result, this has increased downward pressure on cryptocurrencies with exposure to Alameda Research, FTX and Bankman-Fried, or so-called “Sam coins.”

**_Related: [Alameda on the radar of BitDAO community for alleged dump of BIT tokens](https://cointelegraph.com/news/alameda-on-the-radar-of-bitdao-community-for-alleged-dump-of-bit-tokens)_**

SOL’s price has plunged by more than 55% since Binance decided to dump its FTT reserves. Similarly, Serum (SRM), a decentralized exchange asset functioning atop the Solana blockchain, crashed by 55% in the same period.

_SRM/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_Ren, a decentralized custodian project, also witnessed a 33% drop in the valuation of its native token, REN, after [Binance’s announcement of intent to sell FTT](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-to-liquidate-its-entire-ftx-token-holdings-after-recent-revelations).

Overall, Sam tokens, including Raydium (RAY), Bonfida (FIDA) and Maps (MAPS), have dropped by an average of 40% since Nov. 6.

Still hope for Solana?
----------------------

Meanwhile,18.77 million SOL tokens, or around $330 million at the time of writing, will be unstaked and enter circulation on Nov. 10, according to lending data collected by Lookonchain. This may further put downward pressure on SOL’s price.

From a technical perspective, SOL could drop toward $14.30 after entering the breakdown stage of its descending triangle pattern, as shown in the chart below. In other words, a 25% plunge from current prices.

_SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView_Conversely, the Solana token’s daily relative strength index has dropped below 30, or “oversold,” which hints at a potential sideways consolidation or short-term price bounce toward the triangle’s lower trendline at $30 in the coming days.

I'm trying to buy a Solana domain using Bonfida.  I've got plenty of Solana in my wallet and I have enough FIDA too, but when I try and checkout on my order I get ""Not enough tokens"" error.

The following screenshots show both my wallet amounts and the error:

Please can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?!

Thanks!

EDIT: Worked it out!  The cost of the domain had increased from 37.x FIDA to 49.x FIDA while I was in the purchase journey, as I only had 41.x FIDA in my account the error was correct."

As a result of its huge development and growth rate, Solana has gained a lot of attention in the market in the past few years. Several new jobs with great potential have been created as a result of the environment that provides numerous benefits for designers. Check out [these 9 you don't want to miss.](https://www.coinbureau.com/guides/top-projects-solana/#8_Solanium)

# Solana - what is it?

With [Solana,](https://www.coinbureau.com/guides/top-projects-solana/#8_Solanium) users can build user-friendly DApps on an open-source, decentralized blockchain. In 2017, Anatoly Yakovenko began the project with the goal of resolving the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization.

Third-generation architecture supports a variety of DeFi platforms and NFT markets. Solana's hybrid agreement model enables it to process over 700k deals per second, integrating a unique proof of history algorithm with a fast synchronization engine.

Solana's performance and cost have both increased in recent years. Due to its low costs and high speeds, the platform is an ideal platform for developing new projects. Check out some of the best Solana projects currently available.

# Audius

[Audius is](https://www.coinbureau.com/guides/top-projects-solana/#1_Audius) a music streaming and sharing platform that is completely decentralized. Users can listen to and support artists they like through the platform's native token, AUDIO. Three layers make up the task: the app layer, the node layer, and the blockchain layer.

There is an initial supply of 1 billion AUDIO tokens. Circulation occurred as follows:

\- 5% to most active users

\- 18% to the neighborhood treasury

\- 40% to Audius team and consultants

\- 36% to Audius financiers

Because Ethereum was not scalable, they needed a better alternative. Solana comes into play here.

# Raydium

It is an automated market maker that runs on Solana. Raydium is also the DeFi task with the biggest overall value at $1.65 billion. Raydium offers services such as trade, yield, pool, and AcceleRaytor.

Despite being decentralized, the exchange has all the centers of a central exchange. If you trade or swap with Raydium, you do so on Serum. The charges also depend on whether you sell Serum order books or Raydium's liquidity pools.

# Serum

Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that provides the back end for numerous Solana products. With this DEX, users can build and develop applications with on-chain main liquidity pools.

In essence, Serum serves as the ecosystem that powers many Solana jobs. FTX exchange creator Sam Bankman-fried is also behind Serum. SRM and DAO are the native tokens of this decentralized exchange.

&#x200B;

# Star Atlas

A massively multiplayer online role-playing game is still in development called [Star Atlas](https://www.coinbureau.com/guides/top-projects-solana/#4_Star_Atlas). To make Star Aylas as enjoyable and realistic as possible, the developers are using Unreal Engine 5.

According to their discussion, the plot involves managing the Star Atlas members in 2620 in order to save humankind's future. In order to maintain the sustainability of the world, players will need to manage its socio-economic, monetary, and political systems.

To allow players to choose their own path, the video game integrates crypto and NTFS into its marketplace. It might seem risky to invest in Star Atlas while it is still in development. Be sure to do the necessary research before taking this leap of faith.

# Tulip Protocol

When it comes to yield aggregators, Tulip Protocol is one of the best around. In the Solana environment, Tulip Protocol reigns supreme with over $800 million locked up. Together with the Solana structure, Raydium and Serum are partners of this yield aggregator.

For Tulip, leveraged yield farming is best because the yields here are excellent. Using Solana's high-performance and affordable blockchain, this app provides vaulting strategies. With protocols such as Orcs, Saber, and Raydium, it also uses pools and vaults.

# Maps.me

Users can access both offline and online maps through this mobile application. Back in 2011, the job was called MapsWithMe.

By providing users with financial freedom in travel, the application is aimed at providing a much better travel experience. Over 100 million people use Maps.me in over 70 countries. MAPS is the wallet's native token and it supports over 35 cryptocurrencies.

# Bonfida

[Bonfida](https://www.coinbureau.com/guides/top-projects-solana/#7_Bonfidanbsp) is a visual interface of Serum that allows users to trade using the platform. All Serum functions, such as trading bots, continuous swaps, and name service, are here with an API to access data. It is an item suite that supports TradingView and allows users to create their own bots.

Fida is the native token of Bonfida, and it is used for governance and staking. In this case, all costs are collected to enter a pool where users can purchase Fida or burn Fida.

# Solanium

The Solana blockchain platform introduces decentralized fundraising, time-weighted staking, and governance ballots. Users can get involved early in the upcoming Solana idos and tasks through this launchpad.

To participate in IDOs, you must stake SLIM, Solanium's native token. You will receive xSlim tokens when you stake SLIM tokens.

\- Tier 1-- 100 xSlim-- 1 ticket

\- Tier 2-- 1000 xSlim-- 12 tickets

\- Tier 3-- 5000 xSlim-- 100 tickets

\- Tier 4-- 10000 xSlim-- Guaranteed allocation

\- Tier 5-- 50000 xSlim-- Guaranteed allowance

# Media Network

Decentralized material shipment network that provides material from databases to users. Users can integrate Media Network into existing tasks both as a platform and as a protocol. Currently, Livepeer, Solanart, and Handshake are being developed.

The native token here is MEDIA, and the platform is governed by the holders of the MEDIA tokens. MEDIA tokens must be purchased by any project that intends to use the Media Network. Alameda Research primarily supports the job.

# Conclusion

One of Ethereum's direct competitors, Solana offers faster deal times and lower costs. As a result, tasks developed around this blockchain perform much better than their counterparts.

In spite of the fact that the Solanium-based jobs might perform much better, remember that they are still crypto investments. Make sure you do your research before investing, no matter how good they seem. Make great monetary decisions as well as knowing the market situation.

KuCoin [crypto exchange](https://www.kucoin.com/)  remains committed to discovering the next hidden gems in the crypto  space and so we are actively adding new coins to our platform all the  time.

We will now start summarizing all listing-related info within the week  into one post so that you can easily get the whole picture, as well as  find detailed information regarding each listing.

Withdrawal Fee Update,Gemini,vblqdz,2022-06-13 16:35:03,79,0.98,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gemini/comments/vblqdz/withdrawal_fee_update/,Gemini_Gianna,,"Hi all,

We are providing some updates and clarity regarding upcoming changes to withdrawal fees on the Gemini platform. Please note that the withdrawal fee schedule on our website is not yet updated, but we will be updating it to reflect these changes in the coming days. Previously, we had shared that we would no longer be offering free withdrawals after Wednesday, June 15, 2022. We have extended this date to Friday, June 17, 2022 in response to feedback from our community.

**Withdrawal Fees**

When withdrawing crypto to an external wallet, Gemini users will pay either a dynamic or flat fee depending on token type. Dynamic fees apply to withdrawals of ETH and ERC-20 tokens and are based on Ethereum gas fees, which vary based on network activity. Non-Ethereum crypto withdrawals from the Gemini platform incur flat fees (see table below). Transfers between Gemini Exchange and Gemini Custody remain free. GUSD will remain free to withdraw.

**Dynamic Fees**

Dynamic withdrawal fees paid by Gemini users are intended to cover network fees paid to blockchain miners. Miners process crypto transactions and secure the network on which those transactions are processed. Gemini does not make any money from these fees. On the Ethereum network, network fees are known as gas fees and are paid in ETH. Gas fees vary over time and by activity, with complex smart contracts and code requiring more gas. Users will be able to see what the dynamic fee is before completing the withdrawal. Read more about gas fees [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-are-gas-fees-gwei-gas-fees-eth-ether-transaction-fee).

**Flat Fees**

Users pay flat withdrawal fees for non-Ethereum-based tokens. These are also paid to cover network fees. Below is the flat withdrawal fee for each network supported on Gemini.

|**Asset**|**Cost per withdrawal**|
|:-|:-|
|Bitcoin|0.0001 BTC|
|Bitcoin Cash|0.001 BCH|
|Filecoin|0.001 FIL|
|Tezos|0.2 XTZ|
|Solana|0.005 SOL|
|ZCash|0.001 ZEC|
|Litecoin|0.001 LTC|
|Dogecoin|4 DOGE|
|Bonfida|0.5 FIDA|
|Gemini dollar|Free|
|Raydium|0.1 RAY|
|Saber|1 SBR|
|Zebec|1 ZBC|

For more information please see our User Agreement here: [https://www.gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#section-digital-asset-withdrawals](https://www.gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#section-digital-asset-withdrawals)

Update as of 6/20: We are providing an additional update on the new Gemini fee schedule and delaying implementation until June 24, 2022. Please note that the withdrawal fee schedule on our website is not yet updated, and we are in the process of updating it to reflect these changes."

https://preview.redd.it/n4n69pvx2py81.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d05ebc3244cf87d320dd12127ec9779ad7fdcd4

Following Kraken’s listings of **Bifrost (BNC), Bonfida (FIDA)**, and **Origin Protocol (OGN)** for most countries, Kraken is excited to announce the availability of these tokens for residents of the United States and Canada!

### Funding and Trading

Funding and trading are live. Keep an eye on the [status page](https://status.kraken.com/) for updates.

You can add these tokens to your Kraken account by navigating to [**Funding**](https://www.kraken.com/u/funding), selecting the asset, and hitting **Deposit**. Deposits require **20 confirmations** (\~5 minutes) for all, except for **FIDA** (which are near-instant). 

All tokens are tradable on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and the [Kraken Pro](https://trade.kraken.com/) interface with the following minimum deposits and currency pairs available:  


|**Asset**|**Minimum deposit**|**Price precision**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BNC|0.5 BNC|2|
|FIDA|0.1 FIDA|3|
|OGN|25 OGN|4|

Here’s what you need to know about the assets:

**Bifrost (BNC) –** Bifrost provides staking liquidity to anyone accessing its network. This means token holders can stake any cryptocurrency, such as DOT or ETH, on the Bifrost platform and receive a vToken (vDOT or vETH) of equal value in return. vTokens can then be used to access decentralized finance applications while still allowing users to receive staking rewards on their original crypto assets. 

**Bonfida (FIDA) –** Bonfida is a decentralized application built on the open-source Serum trading protocol, powered by the Solana blockchain. Bonfida uses APIs to offer a more complete trading interface with additional features and charting views. FIDA can be used to pay for transaction fees, earn staking rewards or to gain access to exclusive Bonfida features.

**Origin Protocol (OGN) –** Origin Protocol is an online marketplace built on Ethereum where anyone can share goods, services, and most notably, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Holders of the Origin Tokens (OGN) can stake them and vote on the rules that influence the future direction of the network.

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch – not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken’s listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken’s blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future. 

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee of executing at a certain price for a market order. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."
