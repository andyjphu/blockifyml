Questions about Helium,HeliumNetwork,1i9dnhq,2025-01-24 22:09:35,5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1i9dnhq/questions_about_helium/,Cool-Entrepreneur-68,Question,"Hello everyone, 

I'm relatively new to this project and I have a few questions I would like to get answer to. Please note that I am not attempting the spread any FUD or cause concern; I'm just trying to learn and understand the project better. Thanks in advance!

1. Has the move from a decentralized wireless network to Solana truly solved Helium‚Äôs scalability issues, or is it just masking deeper systemic problems?
2. Is the HNT token's inflationary model still sustainable, and how will the reduced miner rewards post-Solana migration impact network participation and the value of HNT?
3. How vulnerable is Helium‚Äôs network to physical attacks or large-scale manipulation by a small group of bad actors, given its reliance on decentralized IoT hotspots?
4. How much accountability do Helium‚Äôs founding team and governance model take for past failures, including the transition to Solana and broken promises of scalability?
5. How is Helium positioned in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny on telecom and wireless service providers as it scales up its network?
6. How many real-world, sustainable use cases does Helium have as of 2025, and has its IoT adoption genuinely increased beyond speculation?"

Decentralized Infrastructure is Here: Can DePIN Replace Big Tech?,AllCryptoBets,1i7bysz,2025-01-22 09:12:11,17,0.95,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i7bysz/decentralized_infrastructure_is_here_can_depin/,oracleifi,DISCUSSION,"Over the past year, we‚Äôve seen massive growth in DePIN‚Äîa sector where blockchain meets real-world infrastructure. Unlike traditional networks controlled by centralized corporations, DePIN projects leverage decentralized communities to build, operate, and benefit from real-world infrastructure like connectivity, mapping, and data collection.

As we know, it is enabling real-world earning through things people do every day‚Äîdriving, collecting environmental data, providing wireless coverage, etc. Instead of corporations controlling and monetizing everything, DePIN allows individuals to own a share of the network and earn rewards in return for their contributions.

Some of the most interesting DePIN projects making waves include:

* Helium ‚Äì A decentralized wireless network where users provide coverage and earn HNT tokens.

* DIMO ‚Äì A project that lets car owners collect and monetize vehicle data for analytics and optimization.

* Silencio ‚Äì A noise pollution tracking DePIN where users earn by detecting environmental sounds.

* Natix Network ‚Äì A DePIN project focusing on real-time mapping and autonomous driving data using AI-powered dashcams.

A recent innovation in DePIN is NATIX VX360, which turns Tesla vehicles into 360¬∞ dashcams for real-time mapping and data collection. Some key benefits of the VX360:

* 360¬∞ Footage Access ‚Äì Uses Tesla‚Äôs built-in cameras to provide full visibility, stored securely in the cloud.

* Earn While Driving ‚Äì Monetizes real-world driving data by contributing to AI-powered map-building and smart city infrastructure.

* Privacy Protection ‚Äì Uses AI to anonymize data (blurring faces and license plates) and lets users define privacy zones where data isn't collected.

DePIN is one of the most promising blockchain trends, and we‚Äôre still early. Some projects may succeed while others fail, but the idea of a decentralized, community-powered internet of things (IoT) is compelling."
Gensler's Last Act: SEC Files Lawsuit Against Helium Network Creator Nova Labs,bitfate,1i731ct,2025-01-21 23:31:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i731ct/genslers_last_act_sec_files_lawsuit_against/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Gary Gensler's Securities Commission took one last swipe at the crypto industry on Friday, suing the company behind the decentralized hotspot project Helium.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Nova Labs, the developer of the Helium network. The lawsuit alleges that Nova Labs sold unregistered securities, specifically the Helium Network Token (HNT), Helium Mobile Token (MOBILE), and the Helium IoT Network Token (IoT), in violation of federal securities laws.

The SEC also claims that Nova Labs misled investors by falsely advertising partnerships with prominent companies such as Nestl√©, Lime, and Salesforce. These companies, however, had no actual affiliation with Nova Labs and even issued cease-and-desist notices over the misleading claims.

Amir Haleem, the CEO and co-founder of Nova Labs, has vehemently denied these allegations, calling the lawsuit a ""last gasp of a failed crusade against crypto companies in the U.S."" Haleem emphasized that Nova Labs had addressed concerns related to misleading investors and maintained communication with the companies named in the complaint. He also warned that labeling Helium‚Äôs hotspots as securities could jeopardize the entire decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) ecosystem.

This lawsuit marks one of the final actions by outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler before his departure, highlighting the SEC‚Äôs persistent focus on cryptocurrency enforcement even amid leadership changes.

Bobcat 300 for free,HeliumNetwork,1i4wuio,2025-01-19 06:53:02,3,0.8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1i4wuio/bobcat_300_for_free/,Ofka27,Question,"My friend bought a bobcat miner a few years ago at peak HNT, used it for a while but has been offline for more than a year. 
He told me he would give it to me for free as he doesn't need it. 

I checked my area on the explorer map and there is only 1 hex with 1 online device on it. Other than that there isn't any hex anywhere close (I live in a bit of a remote area).

I have no experience with Helium mining so sorry for my limited knowledge, but I saw that the device barely uses any electricity (anyway it's very cheap in my area as well). So is there really any downside of using it?

I'm obviously not in it to make money, it's more of playing around with it and getting a bit of experience as I really like the project (in theory at least), and obviously it's a set and forget so whatever happens to the tokens price in the future could be a positive advantage. Just don't want to be losing money now in some way.

Is it a problem if the miner was already used for a while? Can it still work?

Also wanted to mention that putting it outside is not an option for me, I can only put it inside on a desk near my window. Not sure if this it still an option or not.

Thanks for the help!!"
Tomorrow is the day that (hopefully) marks the end of cases like this,ethtrader,1i4s1r4,2025-01-19 01:11:26,13,0.81,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i4s1r4/tomorrow_is_the_day_that_hopefully_marks_the_end/,AltruisticPops,Discussion,"

I think Gensler's iron fist policy as SEC boss has been the most repressive in crypto's history. Dude is about to leave but he just picked on on another victim before closing the door, more specifically [Nova Labs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/united-states-sec-files-lawsuit-nova-labs-unregistered-crypto-securities) (which have been pushing technological boundaries with decentralized networks). His reasoning is: **they offered ‚ÄúHotspots‚Äù to mine Helium (HNT) (the companie's currency) and ran a ‚ÄúDiscovery Mapping‚Äù program that let users trade private data for crypto, both allegedly qualifying as investment contracts**

This repressive policy of limiting these kind of tech instead of supporting it is his legacy. 

Let‚Äôs not forget that under his leadership, the SEC changed the whole ""securities"" thing beyond recognition. Ripple was a perfect example of how abusive his stance was (lawsuit lasted over 3 years starting on December 2020), even when the courts didn't fully agree with his interpretations.

 His consistent anti-crypto rhetoric, labeling almost all tokens as securities, was less about investor protection (as he claimed) and more about controlling the industry as an overlord. 

The lawsuit against Nova Labs is a perfect example. I believe the timing is telling, just days before stepping down, he unleashes one more lawsuit to cement his legacy as crypto‚Äôs biggest douche. 

 **I‚Äôm bullish**

Once Gensler is out, the SEC has a massive opportunity to pivot. No more witch hunting on crypto with this new administration. 

Trump‚Äôs administration will prioritize fostering economic growth and innovation, which includes supporting crypto rather than hating on it. I‚Äôm optimistic that post-Gensler, the SEC will drop cases like this Nova Labs debacle and focus on

The day is tomorrow, January 20th and he won't be missed.

Nebra Outdoor .... witnessed and witnesses not good VS Bobcat,HeliumNetwork,1i3qoar,2025-01-17 16:03:03,4,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1i3qoar/nebra_outdoor_witnessed_and_witnesses_not_good_vs/,RemarkableBowler7718,Question,"Hi, so I LIKE the outdoor miner and still i got this question, if some one else has this kind of problem, that bobcat miner close to me with similar antenna are nearly double the IOT rewards than my N.OD.M.

Any Idea what I can do.... or is the Hardware less good ...

so is the RakWireless / MNTD as example better?  
Using Hotspotty APP and looking around 5 kilometres in my city, those with MNTD are most times those with the best rewards.

So any Idea and advice for me?  
Using McGill 9dbi on 12m House + 4m Pole. POE so Antenna is direct on Nebra Outdoor Miner (N.OD.M).

Hmm....  Main Lime Capybara ..... Kind regards and hoping for good Ideas....

And well well well... HNT is (soon) back!!! YEAH : - )

And yes, because I am to small, I could not move the mouting stuff a little higher.. so the McGill is about 15cm overlapped by the Pole. Come on... you HF Guys... this can not make any problem at all : )

Just kidding!

I have about 286 witnessed in the last 1 day, but 26 were selected by oracle and 241 (90,3%) were not selected.  
of the 241 unselected witness reports, 45 were invalid and 196 valid.

helium GEEK : ""such a high rate of unselcted witness reports mean that the hotspot has too much competion"" .... what can i do??

"DePin Case Studies - Geodnet, Helium, Akash",GeodNet,1i2im01,2025-01-16 01:13:45,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeodNet/comments/1i2im01/depin_case_studies_geodnet_helium_akash/,snowbounicorn,,"Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks or DePin for short, is the integration between blockchain and infrastructure networks. DePin currently exists in industries like energy, telecoms, storage, AI, and data collection.

During the last crypto cycle, many projects rode the DePin hype by identifying problems that had large market opportunities but turned to crypto tokenomics when the core product failed to gain traction, in either demand and supply.

However, to those that survived, many companies took the time to build out their infrastructure, to the point where many generate sustainable revenues by solving existing problems, even independent of tokenomic flywheels. Let‚Äôs go through some of them!

# [Geodnet](https://geodnet.com/)¬†(real-time kinematics)

# Core Problem Being Solved

Why I‚Äôm Leaving Helium: A Reflection on the Project.,HeliumNetwork,1i09p2m,2025-01-13 03:41:23,91,0.86,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1i09p2m/why_im_leaving_helium_a_reflection_on_the_project/,Character-Carpenter5,General Discussion,"After spending a few years actively posting about Helium and supporting the project, I‚Äôve decided to step away. I‚Äôm done. No more help. Honestly, it‚Äôs no longer worth my time.

The Marketing Problem...
The marketing for Helium has been practically non-existent. The foundation invests almost nothing in promoting the project, and everything seems to run on the slow inertia of a few dedicated community members. It‚Äôs disheartening to see such an important niche‚Äîdecentralized wireless networks‚Äîbeing neglected in this way.

üë•
There are a few individuals within the foundation who act as if they know everything, and their attitudes have a ripple effect on the entire community. This arrogance has made it challenging to attract major investors to the project. Why do you think growth has been so minimal, almost non-existent?

Temporary Wins and Lack of Transparency
The only notable deals I‚Äôve seen are a few temporary collaborations with WiFi providers (mobile services). Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthose deals only happened because one of the largest telecom players heavily invested in the startup during its early days.

On top of that, the lack of transparency has become alarming. It‚Äôs all so shady now, with no details being disclosed‚Äîjustified under the guise of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù (Nova, anyone?). How can you call this a decentralized network when everything feels so centralized and opaque?

üåê
True decentralization means everyone should have a seat at the table and equal opportunities. But in this ecosystem, not everyone gets to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the same way. It‚Äôs ironic and disappointing.
I am not going to sell my HNT bag yet.. the price is ridiculously low atm, but I am done with promotion.

üí≠
Goodbye, Helium. It‚Äôs been a journey, but I can‚Äôt keep putting my energy into something that feels like it‚Äôs stagnating.

New to the Helium and it seems like a time of major flux... jump in now or wait?,HeliumNetwork,1hwmnyi,2025-01-08 10:24:44,7,0.82,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1hwmnyi/new_to_the_helium_and_it_seems_like_a_time_of/,know_you_know,Question,"Thinking about jumping into Helium as a hobbyist but everything that is changing in the next \~3 months has me nervous to get started. I live in an urban location that has hotspots nearby but none in my grid (for both LoRa and 5G), and I was on the verge of buying either a Bobcat500 + Baicells Nova 430H or getting [Helium Mobile's white-labeled MNTD. Fi Pro](https://hellohelium.com/hotspot/outdoor) but as I dug deeper, I found out about the coming deprecation of 5G hotspots as well as the transition from mining IOT and MOBILE to HNT. 

I mostly want to get into Helium mining as a hobby (I have my HAM license and am generally curious about IoT and radio) but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't in love with the idea of a hobby that could pay for itself. I am worried that with all the changes going on, I am going to screw up and buy the wrong equipment or pick a setup that will have a hopelessly long ROI.

Could some kind soul save me from myself and help me understand the implications of all the changes, as well as guide me toward what equipment to buy (and help me set reasonable expectations about ROI)? For Helium Mobile in particular, the ROI seems too good to be true... using the [Helium mobile planner](https://planner.hellohelium.com/planner) at my location it estimated that I'd earn \~$135/mo for proof of coverage. For a $500 piece of hardware (Helium outdoor hotspot) I could be making a profit within 4 months?! Seems like a no brainer. But with all the changes happening I'm not clear whether that hotspot is one that will be deprecated, and whether their earning estimates are even accurate. So this is the sort of stuff that has me tentative and I'd appreciate some clarification/guidance from a kind-hearted community member. Thanks in advance."

Grayscale includes 6 tokens in its list of promising crypto assets for 2025,CapitalistExploits,1hsus1s,2025-01-03 14:30:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hsus1s/grayscale_includes_6_tokens_in_its_list_of/,kayakero,,"Grayscale Research, renowned for its in-depth analysis of the cryptocurrency market, announced the addition of six new tokens to its ‚ÄúTop 20‚Äù list of diversified crypto assets with high potential for the next quarter.

Selection is based on criteria such as network growth and adoption, fundamental sustainability, token evaluation, supply inflation, and potential risks.

# New tokens in the 'Top 20' list

The tokens added by Grayscale are:

* **HYPE**¬†, from the Hyperliquid blockchain, focused on layer 1 solutions.
* **ENA**¬†, from Ethena, an innovative protocol in decentralized finance.
* **VIRTUAL**¬†, AI agent platform based on the Base network.
* **JUP**¬†, a decentralized exchange aggregator developed on the Solana blockchain.
* **JTO**¬†, a liquid staking protocol also from the Solana ecosystem.
* **GRASS**¬†, a self-proclaimed token of a decentralized data network.

Grayscale noted that it selected these crypto assets due to expected catalysts such as technological improvements, market events, and their growth potential in the coming months.

# Focus on emerging issues

For the first quarter of 2025, Grayscale will continue to explore key topics such as:

* The regulatory environment in the United States.
* Decentralized finance and staking.
* Decentralized artificial intelligence technologies and autonomous agents.
* The expansion of the Solana ecosystem, one of the most active in the sector.

Additionally, the company remains optimistic about topics discussed in previous quarters, such as Ethereum scalability solutions, tokenization, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).

# Changes in the list of cryptoassets

Tokens such as¬†**Optimism (OP)**¬†,¬†**Chainlink (LINK),**¬†and¬†**Helium (HNT)**¬†returned to the ‚ÄúTop 20‚Äù list due to the relevance of their networks in the current market. However, Grayscale removed the¬†**Celo (CELO)**¬†token , reflecting changes in the company‚Äôs priorities and assessments.

The inclusion of these new tokens highlights the importance of diversified and emerging ecosystems, such as Solana and Base, as well as the rapid growth of decentralized artificial intelligence applications.

I haven't checked my wallet in a while, was expecting to see a couple of quid but was pleasantly surprised when I opened it!

However I'm struggling to figure out the best way of withdrawing.

HNT is no longer supported on binance, which leaves me with the choice of either transferring to SOL and withdrawing to binance or sticking with HNT and using crypto.com.

In either situation I don't have the required SOL in my helium wallet so I'll need to make a deposit there...

Seems like a bit of a headache tbh!

So - my first question is, is the address displayed on the homescreen of the helium wallet app the right one for depositing SOL?

If not, how can I find the right address?

And secondly should I withdraw using HNT to crypto.com or SOL to binance?

Sorry for the noob questions but would really appreciate any help, thank you!"

While traders are eyeing a potential surge back toward $9.53, it seems the uptrend is cooling off as technical indicators nudge the community to proceed with caution. 

The ADX has dropped from a robust 50 to 26.5, signaling a notable reduction in momentum. This weakening trend strength suggests that $HNT is at a critical crossroads, where bulls and bears could battle it out for control. Meanwhile, the RSI sits in a neutral zone at 52, highlighting market indecision after its peak rally earlier this month. Will we see renewed buying power stepping in, or is $HNT gearing up for a pullback?

The EMA trends are where things get spicy. A bullish crossover hint could reignite excitement, potentially pushing Helium‚Äôs price back to test resistance at $9.53. However, failure to sustain its current levels may take the price spiraling down to test the $6.86 support‚Äîbreak that, and things could slip further toward $5.55.

All eyes are on $HNT as it pivots between recovery potential and deeper corrections. Watch those key levels closely‚Äîtrend momentum and trader confidence will hold the answer.

Here's the latest buzz from the DePin universe this week.

OpenLedger locked arms with io.net, the GPU compute network shaking up AI development. This powerhouse partnership provides OpenLedger with the muscle to scale its decentralized AI models like never before. Experts are already eyeing this alliance as a game-changer in unlocking new use cases and driving innovation.

Meanwhile, Helium just got the Ivy League stamp of approval. Harvard Business School has greenlit a case study on Helium‚Äôs journey of crowdsourcing a national telecom network. The result? A solid boost for its $HNT token, which is already up 150% this year. Institutional recognition? Check.

And let‚Äôs not forget Peaq. The Layer-1 DePin champ wrapped up November with style, sharing highlights like its mainnet launch, $1B staked, and USDC integration. While December‚Äôs plans remain a mystery, with 13 new DePin integrations in four months, Peaq's ecosystem is expanding faster than winter snow.

DePin is where real-world tech meets Web3 dreams. Keep your eyes peeled, this sector is catching fire.

After transfer, wallet showed empty, with an exclamation mark at SOL, saying the amount SOL insufficient to support transfer. So I transferred some SOL to Helium wallet, thinking afterwards my HNT would show up, but nothing. Then my eye fell on the activity details: the minute I had sufficient SOL to support transfer, some transfers to multiple accounts were executed.

Adding to the excitement, the RSI now sits at 58, showing strong upward energy while staying below overbought levels. If the golden cross forms as EMA lines suggest, HNT could target resistance levels at $6.5 and $7.2. However, traders should keep an eye on potential support at $6 or even $5.28, in case of a reversal.

Could Helium break out even further and dominate DePIN rankings? Only time will tell, but the momentum is worth watching closely.

Today on the Helium Community call, it was determined that HIP-138 is fully now passed across veHNT, veMOBILE, and veIOT. This means that upon implementation in January 2025, all networks will be rewarded in HNT and MOBILE and IOT emissions will end.



For the past several days there has been spirited debate on whether to proceed with a rescinded vote versus a re-vote, as the veMOBILE vote originally failed. A single large voting entity wasn't fully cognizant of the consequences of their vote and approached several community members about reversal.¬†



Ultimately, the rescind or re-vote were two paths to what's believed to have been the same outcome, and was ultimately a question of efficiency. There was social consensus among the community and consensus within the Mobile Working Group to proceed with a rescind based on the voting entity in question making a public assertion and proving ownership over the wallet, both have been completed.



This matter does expose questions about how HIPs are presented and perceived, however, revotes, reconsiderations, and rescinding votes are entirely normal parts of parliamentary procedure. Our governance framework needs to evolve from an efficiency standpoint, but from our perspective the diversity of input toward the final decision was spread across a healthy range of stakeholders.

Today, I want to explore three notable DePIN projects: NATIX, Helium, and Silencio. Each of these projects has its own approach to decentralizing physical infrastructure, and while they all offer unique features, there are clear differences in accessibility, scalability, and the types of users they target. 

NATIX Network is an emerging DePIN project on Solana, and its focus is on mapping and geospatial data collection through smartphones. Unlike some projects, NATIX allows users to participate with just their smartphones‚Äîno specialized hardware is needed. This makes the platform more accessible, as anyone with a smartphone can contribute and earn rewards for driving.Helium is one of the most well-known DePIN projects, with its focus on decentralizing wireless networks. 

Helium allows users to set up Helium Hotspots, which provide wireless coverage for IoT devices and earn HNT tokens in return. The project has made significant strides in creating a decentralized wireless infrastructure, and it has gained widespread attention for its potential to disrupt the telecommunications industry.Silencio Network focuses on environmental impact by allowing users to earn rewards for measuring noise pollution with their smartphones. 

Using the app, users can contribute valuable data about urban noise levels, which can help cities and organizations manage environmental concerns. It's a unique use of the DePIN concept that turns a global issue like noise pollution into a decentralized, scalable solution new

NATIX Network ‚Äì Leveraging Smartphones for Scalable DePIN

Helium ‚Äì Decentralizing Wireless Networks

DePIN projects turning out to be very versatile and have some serious potential for going mainstream in the near future. I found the info that the total market cap of DePIN project exceeds $32B, that is more than promising. The gap between blockchain world and real-world infrastructure can be overcame with the use of DePIN and the solutions that some projects are offering.

Filecoin has opened their network economy to new usecases with the launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). in 2025, they plan to continue the upgrading of the FVM and they should deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts which will open a lot of possibilities for developers. 

Bittensor is also an interesting project to watch next year. Their collaborative machine learning method enables machine learning models to train collectively, rewarding participants with its native cryptocurrency, TAO. In 2025, they plan to continue refining the decentralized machine learning protocol, aiming to expand the ecosystem and explore new apps across various industries.

Rivalz Network is another decent pick to watch in 2025. They operate as a Dymension EVM-RollApp with Celestia DA and hosts a DePIN, consisting of Worker rNodes and Validator zNodes which can be used for passive income earning. They should launch their native RIZ token before EOY if everything goes according to plan. Their testnet numbers are more than decent with more than 220k participants so far and 15k zNodes running. 

Last, but not the least, Helium with their focus on integrating 5G capabilities to support a wider range of devices and apps. They are planning to enhance its Proof-of-Coverage mechanism in 2025 and increase global network coverage. Their aim is also to solidify its position as a leading decentralized wireless network provider. Not to mention the fact that the HNT market cap has grown by over 190% in the past year, setting a great foundation for the next year.

I bought a bobcat mineral a couple years back (unfortunately at the peak of their cost ~750$ CAD...)

I ran with the mentality of set it up and forget it with minor involvement beyond reading this reddit page and discord for changes and updates. I have admittedly not stayed up to date for the last year now.

I have the black helium wallet and every few months come and claim my rewards, often transferring my IoT to HNT, but that is about it.

My location is not great and my reward scale is now down to 0.5. Given my overly high investment, I'm just getting to the point of my ROI and considering maybe selling off my coins to recoup the cost...from there either continue to mine or maybe sell my miner.

The reason for my post is I am wondering if anyone has any gist notes of the major changes of direction of the Helium project, any changes to mining and the reward spectrum, and future of HNT - any links, forums, or articles would be great as I know I will receive a lot of ""Google it yourself"" replies lol. Just been very busy and now have a ton to catch up on. Hoping the info provided here may give me better insight to the path of Helium and if I should invest some more time again.

Any input is appreciated! Thanks in advance."

This change would phase out the IOT and MOBILE tokens introduced in HIPs 51, 52, and 53, returning rewards directly to HNT. üåê

If HIP 138 is approved:
- Contributions on IOT and MOBILE will now earn HNT.
- HST distributions to HNT owners would be halted.
- IOT and MOBILE tokens can still be redeemed through the treasury anytime.

This HIP aims to build a straightforward, HNT-based system, making rewards simpler and benefitting the buildout of the MOBILE ecosystem.

Grayscale flags three Solana ecosystem tokens as buying opportunities,CapitalistExploits,1gkwdtl,2024-11-06 06:31:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1gkwdtl/grayscale_flags_three_solana_ecosystem_tokens_as/,kayakero,,"Grayscale, one of the largest crypto asset managers, recently announced the inclusion of three Solana ecosystem tokens on its ‚Äúunder consideration‚Äù list, suggesting promising opportunities for investors following the cryptocurrency market.

The asset manager has previously shown interest in tokens, launching the Grayscale SUI Trust in August, which has seen the SUI token rise by nearly 300% since then. Now, with the inclusion of these three crypto assets, Solana could be positioned for explosive growth in a bull market.

Jupiter ($JUP), a decentralized exchange aggregator within Solana, is first on the list. Its main function is to find the best token prices across various platforms, providing users with an optimized trading experience.

The project is generating impressive volumes within the Solana ecosystem, accumulating over $3.38 million (approximately $3.16 million) in fees and a total value locked (TVL) of $1.32 billion ($1.23 billion) this month alone, according to data from DappRadar.

‚ÄúJupiter plays a crucial role in the efficiency of DeFi on Solana and is gaining momentum as Solana continues to expand its reach,‚Äù notes a Grayscale analyst.

In addition to its impact on DeFi, the project has an active staking rewards program that motivates its community and highlights its commitment to rewarding participants. With the potential support of Grayscale, $JUP could attract the interest of institutional investors, consolidating its relevance to Solana‚Äôs growth.

# Cryptocurrencies in the Solana ecosystem

The next prominent asset is Pyth Network, a financial oracle network specialized in real-time data collection. Unlike other oracles, Pyth focuses on data from the financial sector and provides reliable information from over 70 blockchains, feeding smart contracts with data on digital assets, stocks, ETFs, and commodities.

‚ÄúThe Pyth Network is one of the largest oracle networks after Chainlink, but it differentiates itself by its focus on direct financial data from trusted sources such as Binance, CBOE, and Bybit,‚Äù explains another analyst.

This differential increases Pyth‚Äôs reliability and makes it an essential tool for various DeFi platforms. The recent Oracle Integrity Staking program distributed over 700,000 $PYTH tokens as rewards. Grayscale‚Äôs attention puts Pyth Network under the radar, especially given the importance of oracles in the blockchain sector.

Finally, Helium Network, known for its decentralized wireless infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT), emerges as one of the most promising projects for the future of connectivity. Using a community network of hotspots, Helium allows users to earn $HNT tokens for providing coverage, replacing traditional cell towers with a more economical and sustainable solution.

‚ÄúHelium has built one of the largest decentralized wireless networks in the world, now with 5G coverage, further expanding the possibilities in the IoT sector,‚Äù Grayscale remark.

With the expansion of IoT, Helium‚Äôs decentralized model promises to grow, and Grayscale‚Äôs interest may increase its visibility. Helium hotspots are already present in over 180 countries, creating an accessible and efficient alternative to traditional providers.
