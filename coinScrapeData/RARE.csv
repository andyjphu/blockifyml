Tips for natural looks on fair skin,PaleMUA,1i9xjy3,2025-01-25 16:28:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaleMUA/comments/1i9xjy3/tips_for_natural_looks_on_fair_skin/,tiny_al,Discussions,"I'm very fair with cool undertones + I'm a tinkerer who loves makeup, so here are my tips from years of trial and error:

Three revelations upped my natural makeup skills a LOT. 

1. Undertones  
   1. Discovering my undertone made choosing natural-looking shades suddenly much easier. It's also a language that beauty retail employees speak, so they can help you better. 
   2. For example, bronzers and contour always looked so orange on me until I realized that I needed very cool shades. Cool pink blush makes me look naturally alive and awake, whereas anything too warm just looks like heavy makeup.
2. Sheer, buildable formulas
   1. Formulas that are very pigmented and brushes that lay too much makeup on at one time make makeup look like paint on fair skin. 
   2. Find ""buildable"" formulas (or ""sheer"" for lips). 
3. Techniques (and tools) for sheer, subtle, natural makeup
   1. For liquid and cream formulas, apply it to the back of your hand. This is your palette. Now PRIME the brush with the makeup and apply subtly, building up if you need more.
   2. For powders, get a ""powder fan brush"" for a really subtle sheer application that you can build up if you want. 
   3. In general, dense bristles = dense application. Fewer/more spaced out bristles create a more subtle layer, meaning you have more control over building it up. 
   4. Katie Jane Hughes is a celebrity makeup artist with super educational technique videos! Follow her on IG/tiktok/whatever - I've learned so much from her. 

Holy grail no-makeup-makeup products for fair cool skin:

* **Foundation**
      * Liquid 
   * **MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Skin Hydra Glow Hydrating Foundation** in the shade **1R02 or 1R12** (comes in mini). My holy grail. I'll never use anything else for everyday natural looks. 
      * I blend 1/2 a pump with my SPF to create an undetectable sheer coverage base. On me, it needs to be matted out with a powder in the T-zone.
      * Powder: IMO cheap powders look cheap. I use **Hourglass Veil Translucent Setting Powder - Talc Free.** The full size is not cheap but it has lasted me years and years and years. Also, loose looks more subtle and natural than pressed. 
* **Contour**
      * Cream/stick
   * **Anastasia contour stick** in the shade **Fawn** \- best subtle contour for fair skin I've found! No orange tones. It's a stick/cream formula so you'll want a cream friendly brush to blend out
* **Bronzer**
      * Powder
   * **Hourglass ambient lighting bronzer** in the shade **Nude Bronze Light** \- my favorite powder bronzer for fair skin. I've had the full size for... 8 years? 10? It will last ages.
      * Liquid
   * **Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Contour Wand bronzer** \- it looks intense but its actually very sheer and blends out to be subtle if you don't apply too much.
* **Blush**
      * Liquid
   * **Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush** in the shade **Happy (cool pink)** \- get the mini for $15, a little goes a long way.
   * **Glossier cloud paint** in the shade **Puff** (cool pink) - $22 for years of blush. Years. A little goes a long way. Pro tip: poke the foil with a pin to only squeeze out the tiniest bit at a time and it will last you forever. 
   * Don't apply either of these with your fingers or directly to your cheeks. Seriously it will look so much more natural to apply to the back of your hand and apply with a brush.
* **Eyeliner**
   * **Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil** in the shade **Demolition (dark, dark brown)**
   * Can apply super quickly to your upper waterline and look more awake in 2 seconds
* **Lips if you want**
   * **Clinique almost lipstick** in the shade **black honey** is so good for cool toned skin. Sheer formula you can dab on (don't apply like chapstick). Super comfortable wear. 
      * Note: the sheerer the lip formula, the shorter the wear. It's just part of it. The nice thing is that you can reapply without a mirror.  "
Mario Party 11 Boards PT 1,MARIOPARTY,1i9xjlc,2025-01-25 16:28:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MARIOPARTY/comments/1i9xjlc/mario_party_11_boards_pt_1/,Correct_City_6950,,"This is the first out of 7 (coming soon) boards I'm making for Mario Party 11. Also, I'm reusing the Day and Night Cycle from Horror Land and Mario Party 6. There will also be Day and Night events for each board, the event spaces stay in the same spot for the whole game, but the event that triggers depends on wherher the turn is in the day cycle or in the night cycle. Brighton and Twila are also making a return. My first board is 

Chain Chomp Factory

Board Description:

Brighton ""In the daytime, the factory is lively and bustling, you can even see the creation of the humble Chain Chomp, the security office door is shut, I wonder what's behind it""

Twila ""In the nighttime, the machines do dufferent jobs and toads come for maintenance and other jobs, but the factory is quiet and peaceful, and watch out for the security Chain Chomp, if you land on an event space while he's on patrol, he will collect a trespassing fee by taking half of your coins or a star"" 

Board Exclusive Item: The Break room Key, the break room key allows the players to get access to the break room and they get a rare item for free.

Day: The machines are running, the security office door is closed, the day-time events are active

Night: The machines do different jobs and toads come for maintenance and other jobs, the security office door is open, the security Chain Chomp is out, the night events are active

Day-time events: The Creation of the Chain Chomp: The player lands on an event in front of the first machine, all of the machines activate and a Chain Chomp is created. Ignite the Forge: The Player lands on the event space in front of the forge, the forge drops down liquid metal which blocks off the path for the next 2 turns. Mould Shortcut: The Player lands on the event space in front of the Mould, the forge drops liquid metal inside the mould, which drops down behind the player, and the player runs down the path. Release the Chain Chomp: The Player lands on the event space in front of the Security Office Door, the player sics a Chain chomp on another player for 20 coins the Chain chomp will steal a star or 20 coins from another player, and for 40 coins, the Chain chomp will chase another player to one space after the Star. Key Retrieval: The player lands on the first event space after the item shop, The player calls a newly created Chain Chomplet and pays it 20 coins to find and give the player the breakroom key (see Board Exclusive item).

Night-time Events: Machine Maintenance: (See Event Space location above), a Toad checks the machines and finds 10 coins to give to the player who landed on the event space. Forge Cleaning: (See Event Space location above), A Toad cleans the forge and finds and gives the player a break room key. Chainless Chase: (see Event Space location above) The mould creates a Chainless Chain Chomp which chases the player(s) back up the path. Security Chomp Patrol: (See Event Space location above), The security Chomp takes 1 star or half of the player's coins as a ""Tresspassing Fee"". Call Retrieval: (See Event Space location above), the player can pay 10 coins to a Chain Chomplet in order to find and give the player a Chomp Call.

Here is some more information about the Security Chomp and Break room mechanics

Security Chomp: The Security Chomp is a Golden Chain Chomp with a security guard hat. The Security Chomp's job is to make sure that no one tampers with the machinery. If a player lands on the Security Chomp Patrol event space, the Chomp takes a ""Tresspassing Fee"". The ""Tresspassing Fee"" is due to his job.

Break room: The Break Room is an exclusive place within the factory. The Break Room Key is the only way to get into the Break Room. The Key costs 25 coins. The reason for this pricing is what you can get in the Break Room. When inside the Break Room, a player can get a rare and expensive item (e.g. The Golden Pipe or the Triple Creepy Dice). The player can access the Break Room when they come to the path option for the Break Room.

Final Thoughts: This board should be like Bob-omb Factory from Mario Party 9, but better. This board answers questions about the Chain Chomp species, like whether or not they are living creatures, How they are created, and if The Chompworks Galaxy from Super Mario Galaxy 2 is cannon to the Chain Chomps. Speaking of, there are connections between this board and the Chompworks Galaxy. The Day and Night Cycle really fits this board's esthetic because of the nightly maintenance and the Security Chomp's patrol.

A different way to look at fat burning and muscle loss,fasting,1i9xfzn,2025-01-25 16:23:49,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9xfzn/a_different_way_to_look_at_fat_burning_and_muscle/,PurpleCustomer9791,Discussion,"Hi,

I've been lurking here for a while, but wanted to share something that rang a clear bell in mind about how our bodies actually burn fat. I just completed a 15 day fast (longest fast I've done) and am down 19lbs, feeling amazing too after a couple rough days where i didn't have my hydration and electrolytes in check yet. Anyway, while doing my usual routine of obsessing about details and diving deeper into the subject, I stumbled onto something that I wish I'd known during my previous fasts. 

Turns out there's a scientific limit to how fast your body can actually burn fat, this feels kind of obvious in a way bit is rarely part of the discussion as far as I have seen. When I did a little math with this info the results surprised me and it changed how I'm approaching fasting.

 Quick background on me: I'm 260 lbs, about 40% body fat (working on it), and I keep seeing  conflicting advice and practices about exercise during fasting. Some people seem to keep working out fairly hard, others tend to just rest or get low exercise and there are always tons of questions on how to handle it. I found that kernel of information really crystallized it for me, so I thought I’d share.

 Your body can only burn fat at a certain speed - like a pipe that can only let so much water through. For each pound of fat you have, you can burn about 31 calories from it per day (science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45, I believe the high end would be when you are very overweight and have plenty of easily accessible fat). That's not a ""daily allowance"" you can save up - it's more like a speed limit you can't break.

Here's how it breaks using myself as an example:

\* I've got about 104 lbs of fat (260 × 40%)

\* Each pound can release 31 calories per day maximum(assuming 31 as the rate)

\* That means I can burn up to 3,224 calories from fat per day

\* Breaking it down further: that's about 134 calories per hour(the speed limit, not a cumulative total), but this isn’t all available for you to spend, you have to subtract your basal metabolic rate first.

\* Or about 2.2 calories per minute

 **The Muscle Loss Warning**

Here's the important part - if you push past your fat-burning limit, your body doesn't just magically find more fat to burn. Instead, it goes ""Oh, you need more energy? Let me grab that from your muscles real quick."" Not exactly what most of us are aiming for.

 Think of it like this: Your fat stores are like a slow-drip IV that can only deliver a certain amount of energy per hour. If you suddenly need more energy than that drip can provide (like during an intense workout), your body has to find that extra energy somewhere. Guess what's protein-rich and full of energy? Your muscles.

 Some real numbers to put this in perspective:

\* Let's say I go for an intense workout that burns 600 calories in an hour

\* My fat can only provide 134 calories that hour

\* My base metabolism needs about 100 calories that hour(you need to figure this number out, calculators all over the internet)

\* That leaves a 366-calorie deficit

\* Those calories HAVE to come from somewhere - hello, muscle breakdown

 

It's actually worse than just losing muscle mass. When your body breaks down muscle for energy, it:

\* Is less efficient than burning fat

\* Can stress your kidneys (they have to process the broken-down muscle protein)

\* Makes you feel like garbage (that workout ""high"" quickly becomes a crash)

\* Can take longer to recover from

 

What This Actually Means

My body needs about 2,400 calories just to keep me alive each day (BMR). That leaves me roughly 824 calories (3,224 - 2,400) for extra activity. Spread across 24 hours, that's about 34 calories per hour for exercise or whatever. The 34 kcal per hour during sleeping is lost capacity.

 If I burn an extra 34 calories per hour during waking hours on top of my BMR (2,400 kcal/day), my total daily energy expenditure would be approximately **2,944 calories per day**. This would result in burning about **0.84 pounds of fat per day- anything above this means burning muscle.**

**It's important to remember that the less fat you have, the lower these thresholds become.**

 At first I was disappointed that this number is so low, it gives me a very minimal overhead for exercise. But it explains why:

\* People lose muscle when they exercise too hard while fasting

\* Some folks feel great with light walking but crash after gym sessions

\* You can't ""make up"" for a lazy day with one intense workout, you don’t get to “save up” unused fat energy, it’s an on demand system with a limt.

 

 The Numbers

For every pound of fat you have:

\* 31 calories per day(again, science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45)

\* 1.29 calories per hour

\* 0.022 calories per minute(realistically this is the most pertinent number)

 Multiply those by your pounds of fat to get your limits. Just remember your body needs its baseline calories first (BMR), and what's left is w

To be clear about the muscle thing: you'll always lose a tiny bit of muscle during any fast, but the goal is to minimize it. Staying under your fat-burning limit helps do that. The really aggressive muscle loss happens when you push too hard and force your body to break down muscle for fuel, I for one don't want to go lift weights just to lose muscle... Exercise is important to let your body know to protect the muscle, because you are still using it, but there are clear limits.

I’ve probably made some mistakes in here and obviously there are probably some more factors that could be accounted for, like a lower BMR while fasting, differences in BMR from day to night, and rounding to the hour not being super representational… But I would love to hear what people think of this.

Thanks

Newest Spanish treasure!,pirates,1i9wxgt,2025-01-25 16:00:55,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wxgt,TheBlackSpotGuild,,"A beautiful genuine Spanish cob I got today! A 1701 ""pillars and waves"" from the Potosi mint.
A previous owner shined it up and I love it. 
Remember, shining cobs like this up a bit does little to nothing to the actual value of the cob, just sometimes the perceived value. Meaning, this coin is still worth the same amount as before it was polished. It might just be picked up by a different audience. Some people like them polished, some people like them with the natural aging. Both will pay roughly the same for it.
Now, this doesn't apply for the extremely rare cobs from famous wrecks etc. Those you want to keep as original as possible so they match their certificates of authenticity. If you super polish a rare cob and it no longer matches the accompanying cert, it could be hard to resell it. 
And you do want to be careful polishing it so well that you loose all the background patina, as that does make it harder to make out the details, and that too may make it resell for a bit less. By all means, polish them up; just be careful going so hard that you actually remove detail.
I just can't get enough of these. I truly am a treasure-obsessed pirate! 
Pirate on!

Are you on the Hype defi train?,defi,1i9vz0d,2025-01-25 15:18:38,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1i9vz0d/are_you_on_the_hype_defi_train/,ma6ic,:strategy: DeFi Strategy,"I haven't seen much posted about DeFi or Hyperliquid in this sub, so hoping this reaches some new eyes. There are returns on stablecoin yield that blow traditional finance out of the water.

Hyperliquid is a spot and perpetuals exchange that lets any user deposit USDC into their market maker and earn APR based on user demand. It's been 27% for the last month and reaches 30% regularly. It ranges between 20-30% mostly.

That is crazy value for stablecoin yield and there is only a 4-day lockup after each deposit, so the unstaking is pretty liquid.

There's a lot of great coin recommendations in the this sub, but I've seen very little on HYPE, which is a massive opportunity. It's a newer coin with a rabid userbase who is mostly just not on Reddit. Here's a little background on Hyperliquid just for context.

Hyperliquid really made a name for itself in 2024 with what was basically the biggest airdrop of all time—over $10 billion worth of tokens dropped directly to the community. From day one, it attracted a ton of users who tried it, loved it, and ended up building an insanely tight-knit community. People even created supporting products like HypurrFun, pvp.trade, and HypurrScan to build around it.

At the core, Hyperliquid’s tech just *worked* as a good perp DEX should:

* It handled high trading volumes even when the markets were all over the place.
* Spreads were tight, and the liquidity for alts was better than most.
* Just overall, it was smooth and profitable to trade there compared to other platforms.

But what made it stand out was how creative it got:

* Vaults let regular users step into roles like market makers or liquidators (normally reserved for big players).
* Deposits didn’t just sit there—they earned yield and added to liquidity depth.
* A portion of liquidation fees went back into those vaults, which was a win for users.

They also introduced HLP, where users could benefit from both trading *and* contributing to the platform’s liquidity. It was designed to make everyone an active part of the ecosystem.

Oh, and let’s not forget that airdrop—310 million tokens (\~$10 billion in HYPE liquidity). It was on another level, to the point that it created this huge initial push for adoption.

The tokenomics? Super healthy. No VC allocations, no paid market makers. All the fees are reinvested back into the product to benefit users, which is pretty rare.

And this is just the beginning. Hyperliquid isn’t just a DEX—they’re building out an entire ecosystem with dApps on their HyperEVM, a high-performance chain with HyperBFT consensus that keeps everything familiar for developers.

Also, the way they’ve grown is wild. No VC funding. No big marketing campaigns. Everything has been completely community-driven. They basically bootstrapped their way into becoming one of the most talked-about platforms out there.

TLDR: Hyperliquid dropped a killer product that’s both profitable and fun to use, created an ecosystem where the community actually benefits, and kicked it all off with an insane airdrop that got everyone’s attention. Seems like they’re just getting started."
Am I Depressed?,depression,1i9vv3m,2025-01-25 15:13:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1i9vv3m/am_i_depressed/,Sufficient_Front1701,,"I am turning 29 in a few months. I have a very good paying job (started a few months back). Have 4 years of work experience in my field of work. Family is very supportive.

But, past few weeks or months or maybe more than a year has been very confusing or should I say difficult. I constantly feel like something is not right, something is missing.

I live with a roommate, and I am probably jealous of his social and dating situation. He is younger than me by 4 years. Dude gets a new girlfriend before the last one leaves him. Lucky.

I have friends but I think they are JUST FRIENDS. We meet rarely. I want to socialise, go out, but the plans never work. Nobody has time for me I guess.

My last and only girlfriend was in 2017. Getting married is what expected from me now. At this point I am feeling that I missed out on so much. I feel really old, not physically but mentally. 

I am shy, super introvert, but I want to change. I have this constant feeling of being judged. I don’t feel comfortable in my clothes, basically in my entire attire. This has led to be believing I am ugly.

I have a few major responsibilities to fulfil, one is getting married. That is also causing me to get into deep thoughts and anxiety sometimes.

I am really not feeling good and the joy has been gone from my life. I am feeling alone. I really want someone, like a girlfriend or at least a BEST FRIEND. 

Am I depressed or has it started?"
Tutorial: How to get the PS Vita Katsukity capture card mod to work if you don't have the Product Key,VitaPiracy,1i9vueh,2025-01-25 15:12:59,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/1i9vueh/tutorial_how_to_get_the_ps_vita_katsukity_capture/,StringLopsided2042,Question,"In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/1i0d55n/what_kind_of_vita_have_i_bought_not_for_sale/) I was confused by some weird looking internals of a Vita that I bought. Turns out it was a hardware mod that used to be sold. Apparently people could send their Vitas in and get back a hardware mod that installs an FPGA board and an extra mini USB port on the bottom of the Vita which allows you to capture the Vita screen using some propeitary software.

[u/Shadowfied](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shadowfied/) on my previous post pointed me towards the propeitary software which was put on [archive.org](http://archive.org) , not going to lie it looked super sketchy and I was hesitant to install the drivers.

The link to that software was: [https://archive.org/details/psvkatsukity](https://archive.org/details/psvkatsukity)

The link above has a product key but don't use it. Apparently every device has its own device ID which you can obtain after installing the drivers and its own product key which you can obtain once you know the device ID. You won't be able to use the software without the product key and the company (Katsukity) that used to sell these mods has gone under

**HUGE Shoutout to EnbyFish on YouTube** which is where I found out how to get the Product Key. Her video is about how to obtain the product key for the Nintendo 3DS/2DS which also had KatsuKity mods, I decided to try the method for the Vita and it worked. I guess the method in which they generated the product key is the same for the 3DS/2DS as it is for the Vita  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiOrJ\_httr0&ab\_channel=EnbyFish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiOrJ_httr0&ab_channel=EnbyFish)

**Here's the steps to get this working:**

1. After extracting the ZIP file you need to install the drivers in the drivers folder
2. Open the mPSV\_view executable and there should be a button which allows you to get the device ID
3. Copy the deviceID (just the code part, not the start which might start with '0x')
4. Then copy that deviceID into [https://optimize.ath.cx/productkey.html](https://optimize.ath.cx/productkey.html) to obtain your product Key
5. Enter the product Key and boom, your Vita screen is being captured (well projected, I don't think the software can actually record, you might need different software for that)

Apparently Katsukity used to order the FPGA boards from this company [https://optimize.ath.cx/](https://optimize.ath.cx/) and on their website they host a page to those who have lost their product keys.

Apologies if this info is already out there but I couldn't find it so I've written it up for anyone who is also in a similar predicament. I'm not sure how rare Vitas with capture cards are but if you come to get your hands on one then this is how you can get it to work. There is a bit of lag but I haven't played with the settings of the software yet."

He is nice 80% of the time but the other 20% gets ticked off so easily and talks to me like straight shit. Super disrespectful I would even consider it emotional abuse. He says he sorry and we move on, and it happens again. He’s been like this our whole relationship. He always wants to work things out but I am always ready to leave. We talked about co parenting and it would be 50/50. It breaks my heart to be away from the girls even for a day. I don’t know if I could live like this. Which is why I am staying for now. Also, they THRIVE on routine. They have a very good consistent schedule and I would hate to break that. We do things so differently and in his days I’m not sure how well they would be taken care of, I know they will survive but are they getting the love and attention I give them. He plays with them for an hour and then plays call of duty, lets them watch and have a lot of screen time. Doesn’t make them nutritious meals. And I am the opposite, minimal screen time, take them to all the activities, crafts, sensory bins, learning time etc and cook them very nutritious meals. I also don’t think he would follow the nap and bedtime schedule making it very hard for me when I would have them. I also think about if we start dating other people how hard it would be for the girls. Would that other person love them like we do? And if we travel is it going to be weird not traveling as a family? The girls love when we are a family and all together. They are my number one priority in life and right now I can’t even imagine dating anyways because how do you even have time for that when all your attention goes to you kids and then yourself.

What are your thoughts on separating? Should we wait it out until they are older and don’t need so much of a routine? Can you please share your experience? Looking for advice or input if you are separated or grew up with divorced parents. What impact will this have on my two year olds?

Edit: the girls usually see us as two happy parents when we are all together. They rarely see us argue and there were only a few times where they heard him be disrespectful to me. We both agreed to argue away from the kids when they are sleeping etc. when he is gone they get a very happy mom, when I am gone they get a very happy dad and when we are together we put of focus on them so they don’t really see us as “unhappy” we do a good job at hiding and living in the moment of happiness with our kids. We are both very happy people, we just don’t love eachother anymore because of the constant disrespect.

And I am the opposite, minimal screen time, take them to all the activities, crafts, sensory bins, learning time etc and cook them very nutritious meals. I also don’t think he would follow the nap and bedtime schedule making it very hard for me when I would have them. I also think about if we start dating other people how hard it would be for the girls. Would that other person love them like we do? And if we travel is it going to be weird not traveling as a family? The girls love when we are a family and all together. They are my number one priority in life and right now I can’t even imagine dating anyways because how do you even have time for that when all your attention goes to you kids and then yourself.

What are your thoughts on separating? Should we wait it out until they are older and don’t need so much of a routine? Can you please share your experience? Looking for advice or input if you are separated or grew up with divorced parents. What impact will this have on my two year olds?

Edit: the girls usually see us as two happy parents when we are all together. They rarely see us argue and there were only a few times where they heard him be disrespectful to me. We both agreed to argue away from the kids when they are sleeping etc. when he is gone they get a very happy mom, when I am gone they get a very happy dad and when we are together we put of focus on them so they don’t really see us as “unhappy” we do a good job at hiding and living in the moment of happiness with our kids. We are both very happy people, we just don’t love eachother anymore because of the constant disrespect. "
Insomnia While tested for Narcolepsy,Narcolepsy,1i9vqhy,2025-01-25 15:08:15,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1i9vqhy/insomnia_while_tested_for_narcolepsy/,BraveBed4430,Undiagnosed,"Hi, I know this is long & I’m sorry if any of this sounds dramatic. I recently 10/24 had a really rough go with insomnia- things I tried did not work(basic sleep hygiene, zzzquil, Xanax, seroquel, ambien. ) I would fall asleep and then wake up two hours later. Finally I saw a neurologist who understood what I was talking about- he wrote me amitriptyline and at a low dose I was able to fall asleep again. Although lately it has been feeling like it is taking longer to work & I don’t feel super rested compared to no sleep it’s a huge blessing. I also spoke to him about potentially having narcolepsy, as I’ve had fatigue, sleep paralysis over 100 times, and cataplexy (which I didn’t know was a thing for a long time- I thought everybody had funny hands) the cataplexy was mainly as a young child/very rare teenage & seldom as much in adulthood. 

Due to insurance issues, I was never able to meet the sleep neuro yet- however luckily I scored getting into a sleep study- which was yesterday.

Well, off the bat it started out rough. Arrived at 7:45/8pm- When I mentioned I brought my sleep apnea machine the tech said no your doctor did not write this, you cannot use this, & the first test is for sleep apnea if you have it bad you will fail for the second part. This was very frusturating as I already know I have sleep apnea, & the whole reason I went was to be tested for narcolepsy as that is what I believed was causing insomnia. When I mentioned I was having insomnia recently he had said you would not have insomnia with narcolepsy. 

Anyways I go to try to sleep, and it’s not going well. I recently found out I have PCOS & sometimes it feels like it’s pressing on my bladder & I have to pee. I didn’t want to bother the tech so I would try to reposition myself but I ended up having him undo the wires like legit 8 times so I could use the restroom. I was hella stressed thinking about how if I don’t get 6 hours I won’t be able to do the second test & also being hooked up to wires in a hospital room was stressful as my ex died a little over a year ago & spent two weeks in a hospital hooked up to similar wires so I was overthinking everything.

Around 5am I said I should just go home, We already know I didn’t make the 6 hour requirement for sleep to do next test. I was constantly moving around trying to get comfortable for my bladder and it felt like the part of my brain that drifts off to sleep would not kick in. The tech had me stay another hour and when I was packing up to leave he said the test showed I don’t have sleep apnea or narcolepsy. I said how could you even test for apnea if I didn’t sleep? He said well you slept a little. If you had narcolepsy you would have been able to sleep 6 hours, they fall asleep super easy. If this were pre-Insomnia that wouldn’t have been an issue but Ok whatever.

My question is- can the sleep Neuro detect narcolepsy while I was having insomnia during the polysomnography test? I am so scared I blew my chance bc of stress/insomnia that the tech was right and it didn’t show & my insurance will not cover a second test now after waiting & spending money to do this. I have heard they can do a spinal tap for certain chemicals for narcolepsy & at this point I just want to get an answer, I could deal with fatigue/sleep paralysis bc compared to insomnia it’s not as bad. I am worried if I don’t get proper diagnosis the next time insomnia hits I won’t make it thru & most doctors don’t understand.

Any insight on this topic would be greatly appreciated- if anyone has gone thru this or had gotten tested with insomnia and failed, did you find out later you did have narcolepsy, or maybe something else. I still need to meet with sleep neuro I’m just waiting for referral from a new primary.  Thanks you guys."
South Campus Freshmen Dorms,UNC,1i9vpbk,2025-01-25 15:06:51,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/1i9vpbk/south_campus_freshmen_dorms/,why_void,Discussion,"If you are an incoming freshmen and now want to choose a dorm in South Campus for social life, here is my advice, especially if you're looking between the big three in south campus, its Hojo, Ehaus and Craige. I currently reside in Hinton James- Hojo btw, which i choose from reading reddit posts. I want to tell everyone to not pick Hojo if you can, for one reason- the bathrooms. The bathrooms are the same layout for all of them but a key difference is, Ehaus and Craige have additional communal bathrooms in the lobby. Super useful especially when you're sharing between 8 people. Even if you shower at different times, or effectively use the shower and bathroom at the same times, there are a lot of times you wished for another bathroom. It may not be a huge problem to most people, but this is one thing I found frustrating. Another thing is when you get guests, especially if its a girls dorm with guys coming over, trust me, you want your guests to not use your bathroom. Some rooms in hojo has also had some mold complaints which can be ""solved"" by getting maintenance. It is especially affected Ehaus, where some of the mold has gotten so bad that in rare cases, they were asked to live in a different place for 2 days till they got it fixed. Again. these aren't all rooms but it is still good to keep in mind. Craige (No matter how much people call it crusty) has had the least complaints. It's almost like calling it Iceland to keep people away, and I'm not sure if this is true, but its the most newly renovated. Now for walking up hill and buses. The buses are important to navigate from south campus. The RU and U are the main ones and you'll figure out what that means when you get on campus. There is a bus stop down one of the hills which is closer to hojo that takes both the RU and U. You could also more easily go there from craige, but hojo is the closest. Right outside of ehaus is the RU stop with the most minimal walking. There's a U stop right near Horton that's pratically the same amount of walking from all the dorms. I don't think the dorms have affected me much in that aspect but hojo is steeper so you do have to walk up regardless, though if you don't mind it's not a big deal. Now, for the social life, its easier to visit your friends in south campus because most people are on south campus. It's not so social as to everyone is going to come out of their room and immediately start talking to you. The hojo vip party is nothing but one of the RA's DJing, no one shows up to those. There are block parties in the beginning of the week though that are good times to be social but the dorm doesn't restrict you. If you live in ehaus, you can just go to the hojo block party and vice versa. Hope this helps! Peace. "
Trying to find some inspiration on note taking and general organization.,Supernote,1i9vm6e,2025-01-25 15:02:56,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/1i9vm6e/trying_to_find_some_inspiration_on_note_taking/,Neat_Objective,,"This post might look like puke on this page, but please stick with me because there is kind of a point to this.

  
I got a supernote nomad last year (I think). It's been part of my life for quite a while. I truly enjoy writing on it and use it for notes regularly but I suddenly came to the realization that I don't use it to it's full potential.

Currently my use is just notes throughout my day, meetings, quick notes on things I'm doing. There is no real structure at all. This is fine in some cases, but I'd really like to be more organized.

I'm finding I'm also halfway between a digital life and a paper/pen (with a supernote though) life. I've always had this struggle where my calendar, notes, tasks, and todo lists are on a computer program (Github Projects or ToDoist usually) and half end up in my notes. I'd really like to bridge that gap some way.

  
Looking for any ideas of recommendations on organizational structure. I think part of this problem is I just don't know how to effectively organize in this structure. 

  
I'd say my bigger items are:

Projects - I've got a lot of projects (most software type projects) or business projects.

Knowledge management - IE: things I've learned or that process for doing something I forget because I do it once a year...  I used to use a Wiki for this but if I'm not at a computer, this becomes a challenge. Randomly, I'll think of things I want to jot down and they never usually make it into my permanent memory bank

Agenda - I recently downloaded an agenda template. I'm going to try and see how I can build this out for myself. I'd like the quick reference. My calendar can't sync with Supernote and truthfully, I rarely look at my calendar anyways. For my situation, it's usually easier to pull up my Airline app and see when a flight is than open the calendar. 

I've got a ton of other use cases. Things like notes for investments, my portfolio, notes on some of my business things (like talk to this person about that problem that happened), or how I might address an issue. Notes on conversations, I'd like to maintain more details on for later reference. 



I was an org-mode user a few years ago, but due to work I'm back in Windows land primarily, so I just downloaded Obsidian to give it a try. I was also getting bogged down in org-mode with the structure, instead of remembering to take notes or do the task. I don't use emacs outside of org-mode so it wasn't a great fit. I loved it, but it just got to be too much. 

I'm curious if anyone can offer some guidance or advise on a direction to go to just get my self organized. I've struggled with this forever and just feel like I've tried everything but nothing ever sticks. The only thing that always seems to stick is ToDoist for me but only so far as to get me to look at it once or twice a week, everything else I still seem to maintain in my head and if I forget then it hits the fan, so to speak.

  
I should note that email/calendar sync is kind of a limiting factor. I have a single email account with multiple domain names for my business with proton. I do use that as a calendar, but I haven't seen a way to sync that with SuperNote. I'll also note that my work email will 100% not sync due to my employer's restrictions. So it's like living two digital lives sometimes.

  
Thanks for any thoughts or recommendations, I'm happy to learn and hopefully live a more organized and stress free life is the goal.

(THEORY; also disclaimer it is a long post)  I know the age of Tenebrae's plague/imprint ritual in Echoes of Oblivion.,swtor,1i9vk3m,2025-01-25 15:00:35,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/1i9vk3m/theory_also_disclaimer_it_is_a_long_post_i_know/,Budget_Address1559,Discussion,"I see a lot of people on the SWTOR subreddit speculating on just how old the spiritual vestige/imprint of Tenebrae that appeared in the Echoes of Oblivion story and Lingering Darkness story is.    After analysing the lore  and timeline of the Emperor, and refreshing my mind around Tenebrae by watching video gameplays and playing the game itself,  I managed to piece the puzzles together and make a cohesive theory on how old Tenebrae's spiritual imprint/plague is,  along  with a dark twist that I am about to include at the end of this theory.

Here is what we know so far....

* According to the Revan novel,  The Emperor is described as a Sith pureblood with entirely pure pitch black eyes as black as the void itself.  Fits his description in EOO.
* According to the SWTOR Encyclopedia,  it all but confirms that Vitiate did not start using other bodies, such as Valkorion or the Emperor's Voice, until after the Revan novel, as it says that Revan's near assination attempt on him in the Revan novel scared him so much that he decided to keep his true original black eyed Sith pureblood body from harm, and used his essence to start using host bodies, like Valkorion or the Emperor's Voice.
* The Emperor, sometime before or after the Revan novel,  carved an ancient Sith ritual into his real body that acted as a sort of ""imprint"" or vestige of an outdated version of his essence.  It would manifest itself as a plague if the body is destroyed and feed off of the victims's minds and memories to recontruct of what the imrpint believes Tenebrae might have been.  Other than the Valkorion and Vitiate form in the hivemind mindscape, who were drawn and manifested from the memories of Satele Shan and her padawans,  the Tenebrae form we see in Echoes of Oblivion is the only form the imprint genuienly is familiar with and has experiences with,  because that was the form that the plague was made from and carved into.   So the Tenebrae form, the way it acts and behaves, is the key to understanding how old the this plague is.

This all but confirms that Tenebrae was still in his OG true Sith body in the Revan book.   Now that we know that,  we need to know...how old is the spiritual imprint/plague that was carved into Tenebrae's body?  When did he create it?  Well...here is some evidence I found that supports how old it is.

* If you ask Darth Marr's ghost on how long ago this impression of Tenebrae was made, he guesses but strongly thinks that it must have been long before their time, even before Revan's time he thinks.  He admits he is guessing but there are other evidence to support this case.
*  The Tenebrae form we see in Echoes of Oblivion, instead of being dressed in modern Sith Empire armor or sith robes like most Sith do, is actually dressed in a very outdated ""Egyptian King style""  Sith outfit that matches the outfits of great Sith Lords from the original ancient Sith Empire.  As we know in the Tales of the Jedi comics,  Sith Lords of the original Sith Empire before the Great Hyperspace War dressed in these very fancy,  golden and jewelry king outfit armor and dresses, examples include Marka Ragnos, Ludo Kressh, and Naga Sadow.   So Tenebrae being dressed like this in EOO implies that this plague and memory of him  is reallly, really old, possibly ancient, from a time earlier in Tenebrae's life.
* The Tenebrae form in EOO condemns the original version of himself that we killed back in KOTET to be too complacent, too ""distracted by mortal concerns"".   Such as a family in Valkorion's case, and wars, and also **empires**.  Notices how Tenebrae says wars and empires in plural term instead of singular, implying that the Tenebrae form is not just condemning his original self for being distracted by ruling the Eternal Empire, but also the Sith Empire itself.  This implies that the memory of Tenebrae predates the time when Tenebrae became Sith Emperor.
* One thing about Tenebrae/Vitiate that made him different after the Ritual of Nathema that made him immortal  was his voice.  It has a very damned rebverating demonic echo and resonances to it, ""almost as if a great multitude were speaking his words in perfect symphony"" according to the Revan novel.   However,  when we meet the old memory of Tenebrae in Echoes of Oblivion,  he has a singular normal dude's voice.  No demonic resonance to it, implying that this memory and plague of Tenebrae was made BEFORE the Ritual of Nathema.  
* One thing we have to know about Tenebrae/Vitiate is that after he gained immortality after the Ritual of Nathema is that it came with a price.  Tenebrae would lose all of his sense of emotions.  Taste, smell, and touch would mean nothing to him, as well as sadness, and anger.   He would act very calm, cold, and emotionless, and rarely act out of raw anger unless he is really pissed off.   In the Revan novel and SWTOR,  the Sith Emperor Vitiate is very emotionless, calm, calculating, and ruthless in a very emotionless way.  Vitiate even said to Scourge in the Revan novel when he ""blessed"" Scourge with the same immortality that Scourge would lose all of his emotions and become mentally, physically, and emotionally numb.   This is true,  Scourge in SWTOR is very emotionless, and doesn't get his emotions back until after he loses his immortality when Vitiate's spirit died.  Why am i bringing this up? Well....
* As I said in the previous bullet list,  beings who suffer the immortality of Nathema have to sacrifices emotions and the likes of that, even Tenebrae/Vitiate himself went through that.  They become cold, ruthless and emotionless and expressionless beings.   However, the memory of Tenebrae that we meet in Echoes of Oblivion...is exactly the opposite of that.  Instead of the cold, calculating Emperor we know, the Tenebrae memory is very very emotional, and full of expression.  He cackles a lot,  makes annoyed or angry faces,  puts so much rage and emotion into his voice, and he gets easily annoyed and anrgy and expresses it clearly.   This further implies that the memory and plague of Tenebrae from EOO predates his immortality ritual in the Ritual of Nathema.

Okay, so, what's my theory?  My theory is that the imprint of Tenebrae that we face in Echoes of Oblivion was made several decades before the Great Hyperspace War and the Ritual of Nathema.  Given that Tenebrae looks limek a healthy young man in EOO, I suspect it was sometime early in his   young adulthood reign as Lord Vitiate of Nathema when he carved this Sith ritual into his body.  

 Why did he make the imprint plague ritual?  I suspect that this was Tenebrae's earliest attempt on trying to achieve immortality, so he made this imprint and memory vestige of himself into his body.  However,  several decades later, during the Great Hyperspace War when he was old,  Tenebrae/Vitiate decied that he wanted to achieve more immortlaity, hence why he did the Ritual of Nathema and became virtually immortal.   Even though he carved the plague ritual into his body, he still used his body until after the Revan novel,  more than a thousand years later

However, if the memory and imprint of Tenebrae was made early during Tenebrae's reign on Nathema, being made several decades before the Ritual of Nathema and the Great Hyperspace War, why does it have the same powers, if not, more power than the OG version of himself when it should be weaker, given it was from a time when Tenebrae was mortal?  My theory is that Tenebrae was still a very powerful Sith Lord even when he was a mortal pureblood, and he spent heavy ammounts of dark side rituals and deep sorcery to make this plague very potent.  When he consumed Nathema decades later and became immortal and very potent even more,  it also ""juiced up"" the potency of the imprint carved into his body decades earlier as well.   Also,  the plague ritual also is know for not only sucking the memories of it's victims, but also it's powers too.  Since Satele and her padawans all combined are very powerful, and given that the plague was very potent and feeding off of their combined strenght,  it would make sense as to why the memory of Tenebrae in Echoes of Oblivon is super overpowered even though it was made from a time before the Ritual of Nathema.

Alright, to wrap this all up,  here is the dark twist at the end of my theory.  Given that Vitiate was STILL in his OG body in the Revan novel and didn't use other bodies until after the book, my dark twist theory is that since he was in his original body still, Vitiate still had the plague/imprint ritual inisde of him.  Had Revan, T3-M4, Scourge, and Meetra Surik succeeded in killing Vitiate and Scourge didn't step in, things would have been disaterous.  Had Vitiate been struck down,  his body would have released the plague and wpould infect Revan, Meetra, and Scourge and reconstruct a new Tenebrae.

This is my theory.  It took a long time for me to process all of this, but I think it makes sense in the end.  Thank you and have a nice day :)"
"Dell XPS 15 consistent issues with power, shutdowns, startups, charging etc.",techsupport,1i9vio6,2025-01-25 14:58:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1i9vio6/dell_xps_15_consistent_issues_with_power/,estoytom,Open | Hardware,"Hi all, I recently purchased a Dell XPS 15 7590 from my workplace as they were doing a charity sale. I'm aware that the model is slightly old now, but with 32GB RAM, an i7 and a decent Nvidia graphics card, it was a deal that I couldn't turn down. On the first day, the device worked fine. Since then, there has been non-stop consistent issues which has basically registered the device unusable at least at this current moment. The following are the issues that I've faced:

* Inconsistent booting and powerup. At this current point, I cannot make the device turn on. I installed some updates on the device when it was on and after restarting it would not power on. I've tried following the hard reset and power cycle guides online and while they seem to work and the keyboard backlight comes on, the power light and fans come on, they only remain on for a few seconds before powering off. I'm trying everything including unplugging the charger, power cycling and I even took the back of the laptop off to remove and drain the battery to start again. Sometimes I get the flashing white and orange indicator.
* System Service Tag. I've set the service tag twice now, yet the PC just doesn't seem to remember it. I boot from BIOS and set the service tag. I've seen that some others have had this issue and one of the forums on the Dell website said to update the BIOS to the latest version, which is what I did, but the issue still persists.
* Only running in Manufacturing Mode. The only way that I'm able to run the laptop consistently is in Manufacturing mode. On startup, I get a black screen saying the laptop is in manufacturing mode and if I press Alt + F, it'll turn off. If I turn manufacturing mode off, the laptop works for a couple of minutes, then shuts off completely, very rarely wanting to turn back on, which makes it super annoying when trying to reproduce the issue. The PC seems to run fine in manufacturing mode, but this causes the PCs fans to run at 100%, which is both noisy and also cannot be good for the PC in the long-term. Even after starting up in manufacturing mode, signing in and pressing Fn + x, the fans power down and after a couple of seconds, the PC shuts off again. It even also sometimes shuts down while in manufacturing mode, which is something that has just happened after trying to reset my pin to log in.
* Consistent unexpected shutdowns. The PC just shuts down randomly. After signing in (in normal mode), it could take a couple of minutes but the PC just shuts down and it's very difficult to turn it back on. It takes a combination of different patterns of holding the power button, plugging and unplugging the charger, powercycling to power it back on. It often takes just leaving it for 30 minutes before it decides it wants to power on again.
* Inconsistent charging. I noticed yesterday that while the charger is fully functional and works as expected, sometimes the PC won't charge. It's very intermittent if it decides that it wants to charge.
* SecurityHealthSSO.dll warning. When logging into the device, I often get a SecurityHealthSSO.dll warning. I've run diagnostics on terminal including sfc /scannow and DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth, but everything returns as normal.

I've read on some of the Dell forums about potentially a bad motherboard or replacing the heat sink, but I'm not a hardware guy and I'm nervous that I would mess it up. This Dell user seems to be having similar problems to me, but nobody has replied to his thread on the Dell forums [https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/xps/xps-15-random-shutdowns-and-missed-restarts-manufacturer-mode-and-caps-lock-stuck-on/66409e022334016b0ea4c388](https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/xps/xps-15-random-shutdowns-and-missed-restarts-manufacturer-mode-and-caps-lock-stuck-on/66409e022334016b0ea4c388). What's the play here? Do I return it to work and say it's faulty? I've contacted Dell and they've quoted me £350 for a replacement motherboard. Do I take it to a computer repair shop and try to fix it there? I've never experienced this level of multitude of issues before and honestly don't know where to turn to solve it. I've done a lot of research and have found that many others are experiencing the same issues that I am."

"Shower thought: Enjoying long grinds in OSRS is more akin to meditation than ""fun""",2007scape,1i9vcjt,2025-01-25 14:51:05,9,0.84,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1i9vcjt/shower_thought_enjoying_long_grinds_in_osrs_is/,thestrehlzown,Discussion,"I see so many arguments on this subreddit about whether long grinds are ""fun"" which is highly subjective, but I've begun to realize the key to enjoying the grind is to treat it like a meditation. This feels relevant when explaining to our non-player friends why we would spend thousands of hours repeating the same sequence of point and click actions for that final level or elusive rare drop.

Long grinds aren't ""fun"" in the same way doing a boss for the first time is fun, or playing a fast-paced multiplayer PVP video game is fun. Undoubtedly, there are lots of super fun things to do in OSRS, but with every activity, the fun dissipates after 10, 100, 1000+ repetitions/hours of the same gameplay loop.

To say grinds are a ""different kind of fun"" doesn't feel descriptive enough, hence thinking of it as a meditation. Sitting on the couch grinding out 94 to 95 fishing on mobile isn't ""fun""; locking in and grinding out the 1000th TOA expert run might be relatively more engaging click-wise, but at that point you're just begging the gods for the drop/greenlog and trying to stay motivated to keep going. 

I've seen people compare the motivation amidst super dry streaks as masochism, but I think it is better understood as impressive meditation. Once you stop caring about that drop, that 99 or 200m, and start losing yourself in the repetition, turning off your brain, thats when the magic happens. "

I just wanted to give back all to the community what I received the last couple of months.

The process finished 3 hours ago and I'll list all the things that I found worth mentioning as bullet points:

• Super lovely doc and everyone else.

• I booked everything they offered to have the best possible outcome

• Consultation was amazing, she tried to incorporate everything you want to have and at same time tries to get the best result. Also during surgery she can adapt depending on what you have.

• My biggest fear was the pain. I don't know if they have secret but the pain was 1/10. And this only maybe for times. I was waiting the whole procedure for the pain but nope :)

• Meals really on time.

• Hairline looked super nice after surgery 

- Can't say anything about the outcome YET meaning the health of the implants,

- I didn't had much extra single hair so they gone the extra mile to give me the best possible front hairline.

• After surgery, no dizziness or pain, it's been already for hours. I was able to reach my hotel and go for some snacks without any issues.

• Last point I couldn't sleep couple of days before the surgery, so completely took a wonderful nap for maybe more 8 hours, 10/10 sleep ✌️😁. It's a pity I loved talking to them, they are interesting nice kind and funny.

One thing because it was on the weekend, I didn't know you should charge the WISE app couple weeks before to avoid any complications. Or call your bank to change the credit card limits for foreign countries, which I couldn’t because it was a weekend 😑. Actually I'm very ashamed of myself for not keeping my promise exactly. Still trying to figure out a way. It’s Sunday now. Let’s see if I can find a possible solution.

For any questions feel free to ask me anything."

need help getting EPF baby to take a bottle : (,breastfeeding,1i9v3c5,2025-01-25 14:39:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1i9v3c5/need_help_getting_epf_baby_to_take_a_bottle/,tiny__e,,"\*\*EBF, I posted too quick and can't change the title...

Hi everyone, I've reasearched this extensively but am wondering if there's some trick I've missed.

My girl is 10 weeks old (11 on tuesday) and EPF. When she was about 4-6 weeks old, my husband was able to get her to take a bottle pretty easily several times - so easily that we got lax and didn't keep it up. Now, we're going back to work on Wednesday (we work together) and have been trying for a week with almost no luck - she hates the bottle. Sometimes she'll tolerate it in her mouth but she won't latch or swallow. She tolerates a paci sometimes but it's rare that she'll latch on that either (I've tried like 8 different pacis).

We've tried a few different bottle nipples, different temperatures, defrosted milk and fresh expressed, me in the house or out of the house, different positions, different times of day...doesn't seem to make a difference. I keep hoping that consistency of offering it will help but yeah.

We work in the film industry so we will be gone for around 11 hours the day we are gone next week, my MIL (who I adore and trust) will be watching her. So just letting her be hungry all day isn't an option.

She generally gets super upset when offered the bottle and after a few minutes of crying, my impulse is to just let it go and offer her the boob, but my husband thinks we're going to teach her that if she fights the bottle long enough she gets the boob. Is it possible for her to even build an association like that at 10 weeks?

Thanks in advance, a very anxious mom"
"How do I go about figuring out the whole ""treat the symptoms"" dynamic, when the possible diagnoses indicate very different treatment plans?",AskPsychiatry,1i9v36e,2025-01-25 14:39:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1i9v36e/how_do_i_go_about_figuring_out_the_whole_treat/,Evening_Fisherman810,,"**Short Summary - I have had many encounters with the mental health system off and on throughout my life.  There is a big discrepancy between opinions on what I am struggling with, and the treatment for both is different.  How do I know what treatment path to take?**  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
Mental health professionals have been struggling to determine my diagnosis for years.  Basically, there are two camps:

***Camp A)***  I have a personality disorder, likely BPD with components of other personality disorders. 

***Camp B)***  I have no personality disorder, but when my Schizoaffective Bipolar Disorder and ADHD aren't treated, it presents like a personality disorder.

***Evidence for Camp A:*** 

*  I'm evidently too high functioning for a psychotic or mood disorder
* There have been a lot of suggestions that I am deceptive.  I personally don't think I am - I work really hard to be super honest and up front, often to my detriment - but this has repeatedly come up when I have mentioned symptoms and they have then reported in the file that this must not *actually* be the case.  Like how I endorse a love for spending time alone, but then they say in their notes that I must not actually like being alone because I seem very extroverted in my presentation and I chose a very social job.  Or they will be like, ""Parents divorced at young age.  Patient says this was not an issue for her and hasn't caused any trauma.  May benefit from psychodynamic therapy"".
* I had one team of psychiatrists and therapists in an IOP that I participated in when I was 19 or so diagnose me with Personality Disorder NOS with traits of BPD, NPD and DPD.  
* I have had ER physicians and psychiatrists note BPD traits on my chart during two years of repeated ER visits over a span of two years in my early thirties
* When I was in my mid-thirties, I went back to the ER and a psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD based on what had been previously noted in my chart but without doing a psychiatric interview with me.  We did talk for twenty minutes or so, but not about my life in general, just about that one emergency room admission. 
* I don't have a lot of external hallucinations.  
* I have had marital problems since having a kid about 8 years ago and entering therapy a year or two after that.  
* No one was able to detect my manic episodes. Strangers noticed, but my actual family and friends didn't, indicating that they weren't actual ""mania"".  
* History of self-harm
* The medications that have worked effectively for me (Clozapine, Loxapine and Latuda) are used off-label to treat personality disorder symptoms at times
* I retain some level of insight during mental health crises (like I know that it isn't normal to feel good and suicidal at the same time, or I know that I normally wouldn't think it was a good idea to jump off a bridge to enter a portal to another dimension so even though I try to convince myself that I should do it like I know I am being called to do I will have periods of doubts).  
* I have traditionally reached out for help when feeling acutely suicidal
* I have believed I had factitious disorder before.  I didn't fake any of my symptoms or anything, but I thought I was subconsciously doing them as a need for attention or something, and that I wasn't actually sick
* Nurses in the Emergency department have endorsed BPD
* I can have periods of intense irritability around other people



***Evidence for Camp B:*** 

* I fully remitted from every single symptom when on Clozapine and Dextroamphetamine.  The first time  this occurred lasted for a two year period.  The second time was only over the course of a few months, but both times continued until I discontinued my medication.
* All of the ER encounters noted above were after I had abruptly stopped medication. 
* Any psychiatrist or psychologist who has treated me (not just seen me one time) outside of the IOP program when I was 19, has not endorsed any personality disorder.  Many have investigated the possibility, but none have ever come to the conclusion that I actually had a PD.  I have been with my current psychologist for over 5 years, and my current psychiatrist who treats me in the hospital and out of the hospital for the same amount of time.  
* I have periods unmedicated without any significant symptoms around emotional dysregulation.  Some potential ongoing psychotic symptoms have occurred, but not anything definitive - I can't confirm whether I have delusions when not experiencing a mood episode, and my hallucinations aren't clear-cut. 
* I have many close relationships with family and friends with no conflict or minimal conflict.  I have been with my spouse for nearly twenty years.  I have at least 4 very close friends who I know I could call on for absolutely anything and those friendships have ranged from 27 years to 4 years.  I have a smattering of other friends that I could call for social outings or assistance if needed.  I don't feel a real need for social relationships, but I do enjoy the ones I have as long a I get enough quality alone time.  None of my family or friends endorse any personality disorders.
* I respond to medications very well, and the problems tend to be around significant side effects rather than treatment-resistance.  The medications that work best for me are Clozapine, Loxapine and Latuda (in that order).  
* My delusions have always been bizarre rather than focused on people in my life
* I struggle more with thought issues than mood issues, but when mood issues do occur they can dangerously exacerbate the thought issues - like thinking I need to commit suicide in order to align myself with the universal power.  I don't actually believe this normally - I am a semi-active Catholic.  
* Some of my worst mental health crises have occurred when my life was at its absolute best, with minimal stress, great strategies being used, healthy environment.  They do tend to correspond with me not managing my sleep schedule well.  
* The being dramatic/attention seeking belief doesn't align with my behaviour outside of my past willingness to reach out for help, but even when reaching out for professional help I wasn't really disclosing to family and friends the extent of what was going on.  I tend to downplay a lot of the stuff, even with medical providers because I don't want to be seen as dramatic.  
* I had a separate clinical psychologist who specialized in assessing BPD do a private assessment so that I didn't have to share the info if I didn't want to, and could be fully upfront with everything that could possibly indicate a BPD diagnosis, and she did not endorse BPD.  However, she didn't assess for other possible personality disorders.
* Nurses in the psych ward do not at all endorse BPD, but they have not ever commented on the possibility of other PDs.
* I have access to Ativan, and I rarely take it.  I have been going through the worst period of my life in the last month to two months, have had a prescription of 30 Ativan to take as needed, and I have taken maybe 4?
* I rarely get angry, and when I am angry, I am very focused on resolving the conflict in a fair and diplomatic way which I guess it an atypical response for people with emotional dysregulation.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So one of the primary reasons I am not currently accepting any further treatment for my Schizoaffective/Bipolar is that I don't want to be taking medications for something I don't have if I can be working on it through therapeutic techniques.  I know I can have \*both\* a PD and a mood disorder, but I feel like there aren't definitive symptoms outside of each that only fall into one category and therefore justify both diagnoses.  I personally feel like the Schizoaffective-Bipolar type + ADHD diagnoses align with what I feel and experience, but if I don't have insight into my psychosis most of the time, could the same be said for any potential personality issues?  And it would be irrational for me to dismiss this as a possibility.  

So how do I go about choosing the right treatment plan for me?  I want to trust my treating psychiatrist, but that fact that so many other psychiatrists are ready to pop that label of a PD on me immediately makes me second guess things - and now that it is on my chart and I can't have it removed, I feel like I should at least be exploring that route for a few years.

And tonight it finally happened! I got Grecke Wanda in my shop which made the Album 11/12 complete. I'll try the method with Blue Marvel (the last variant I need) again hopefully with the same results.

Does anyone else react to calcium supplements and baking soda?,Allergies,1i9umal,2025-01-25 14:19:17,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1i9umal/does_anyone_else_react_to_calcium_supplements_and/,LycanFerret,,"  This is something I personally don't fully understand, but my body cannot have Sodium Bicarbonate, Calcium Chloride, Calcium Silicate, Monocalcium Phosphate, and Tricalcium Phosphate. They all produce insane heartburn, make me very dizzy, and I vomit in some situations. And it sucks because a lot of these are in salt and water. Not even food. Salt. And water. I can only have 100% pure sea salt or kosher salt, and cannot buy any waters that say ""with minerals"". Any salt or water with these additives renders me in agony all day and all night as my throat feels like it is being melted alive and my gut is bloated and on fire and I get super dizzy. This also applies to vitamins and supplements, because I notice vitamins with these additives also cause heartburn. Just not as severe as water and salt. Maybe cause of the other additives. 
 
 
  Baking Soda and Baking Powder do something very similar, but they mostly cause bloating, gas, nausea, and vomiting for me. In rare cases diarrhea. My body rejects them."
Have our drinks been spiked?,AskDocs,1i9um5x,2025-01-25 14:19:09,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i9um5x/have_our_drinks_been_spiked/,Fuzzy-Caramel6181,Physician Responded,"4 females aged between 27-32, height 160-170, normal figures, all smoking 

we went out 4 of us girls and 3 of us ended up badly the next day, me the worst. All three of us drank exactly the same amount and the same drinks: 4-5 glasses of wine in a span of 4 hours at the restaurant + two small drinks at the club. The girl who felt fine today had only wine. 

I know myself and my friends very well. It was not the amount which can kill us or make obnoxiously drunk. 

I ended up badly. First already during the night I started to feel low and asked to go to my friend’s house which is unusual for me, I am always the one staying longer than shorter. In a taxi I started to get sick what never happens to me even if I am super drunk. Then I puked without any control in the middle of the street - again something I don’t do + even if I puke I feel better afterwards and here it was not the case. We came home and I passed out on a couch. I could hear my friend talking to her boyfriend but did not have any power to move my body or open my eyes. My friend needed to shake me and take me to bed. 

Next day was a disaster - I puked more than 10 times until 2pm, was shaky, migraine, nothing was helping, nausea was killing me Again in a taxi on the way to a clinic I felt sick and puked. Eventually 1 liter of IV and medications calmed down the vomittin and nausea. 

One friend felt okay during the night, but later had bad hangover, migraine and urge to vomit, but managed to sleep it through. She rarely feels the urge to vomit and handles hangovers pretty well. 

Second friend started feeling bad once she got home, she felt more drunk then usual. When I passed out on her couch but could still hear her I  remember telling to myself - o wow, she struggles to speak which is weird.  Next day she felt dreadful, puked twice and lost consciousness while doing so + got draining migraine. 

Could it be that the drinks were spiked or we are just unlucky with shitty quality alcohol? "
my whole family hates me,Vent,1i9uket,2025-01-25 14:16:56,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i9uket/my_whole_family_hates_me/,aagghhhihateuuu,TW: Drugs / Alcohol,"i'll start this by explaining i only just became a legal adult and my life hasn't even really begun yet. when i was younger i lived with my sister and my mom, and we lived in another persons house out of the kindness of their own heart. we aren't fortunate at all. my parents made bad decisions before we were born which caused me and my sister to be at a bit of a disadvantage. i still get a little jealous of people with nepotism, even if they aren't amazingly rich. 

my mom used to be pretty good with things. she was a heavy weed smoker but i never really saw how it affected things until i got older. other than that, she used to get her bills paid and provide for us in ways we needed. and even managed to get us vacations rarely. nowadays, she has a good new job, but it's not making her any better. she spends lots of money on drugs and alcohol and is usually drunk. her and my father had a huge fallout and break up (never having been married) because my dad was a drug addict and mainly an absolute drunk. he was always shitfaced before noon without fail and could never hold a job. and these days, my mom is constantly spending all her time out of work getting shitfaced. she kinda hates my father for the same reason she should hate herself. it gives me super complicated feelings about everything. my mom is constantly trying to brag about hooking up with guys and getting drunk by herself, and some days it feels like she is trying to instill those feelings in me. like she is weirded out that she was always a slut or a cheater and i have been with loyal with my high school sweetheart ever since we started dating (we are still together) 

and then theres my older sister. when we were younger, my sister was always the smarter one because she was older. she was street smart and book smart and was always praised for it while i was called stupid or not allowed to do things by myself because nobody thought i could handle anything. she had good grades all through high school, even during the pandemic. for me the pandemic caused a snowball to begin rolling and i never necessarily recovered even though i'm doing much better. i basically failed everything all of high school until i graduated. 

after graduation for my sister, she sorta got kicked out. my mom wanted to move out of the home we were living in and didn't have enough money or space to provide for the both of us. since i was still in high school, my mom made that choice. it seemed like my sister was doing okay, because she had signed up for our local community college and had a job and a place to live. i was happy for her, even though i was sad because i missed her so much. i went through my junior year and met a boy who i love and plan to marry. in the summer after junior year, my sister wasn't doing so hot. she had to move in with our father and at some point left her job without saying anything. i obviously knew something was up and my mom tried to go see her but my sister didn't even let that happen. my sister was doing fentanyl and pretty much almost killed herself that year. 

i can't say im mad about it. i know some of it is her fault, but i still blame my dad for being a bad father. it was all his fault she got hooked on that shit. and i will never forgive him for anything as long as im alive. it feels unreal to be related to such a villain-like human. my sister got sent to the hospital when i was in my senior year, and the rest of that school year i basically stopped caring about my grades so i could make sure she wasn't gonna do any drugs. i pretty much was close to dropping out but managed to graduate.

my sister had all her options laid out for her after she came back from the hospital. she decided to actually go to school at our local community college but when time came around for the semester to start she only really went like one day out of the week and ended up with a 0.284 gpa and on academic probation. you only need a 2.0 to get an associates there. i tried to wake her up, people tried to get her to school, but she just didn't go. she gets into relationships with boys while she hoes around with some more and has to rely on others to take care of cats she can't pay for that are hers. and i've already told you about my mom. 

i have been doing well for myself. i found salvation when i met my boyfriend and his family and learned that they were successful for reasons my parents and people i know were not. my boyfriend used to be a dirtbag and was ungrateful for his parents but when we started dating i showed him he basically had it all, multiple vacations a year, all the food he ever needed, a fruitful Christmas, and two married parents. he saw what i came from and realized that he had it good, and because we are in a healthy relationship and never really get into fights, his parents took me in because they thought i was a ""good girl"" 

my mom seems to be distant towards me because i found a boy at a young age who is getting a job to provide for the both of us and get us to financial stability. she seems to be distant towards me because i am deciding not to get drunk or smoke with her because i simply don't want to. she seems to be getting really distant because i found a path to success. it seems my sister hates me for the same reason. i just don't know what to do. is it really my fault i wanted to keep the line going of not making a name for yourself? i want to go to college because i have big dreams. i get so upset because i feel like im at the absolute bottom of the list. there are so many people going into the industry i dream of getting into because their parents or relatives have been in it and i quite honestly have nowhere to start other than community college, and the shit i make for myself at home. which realistically, would get me nowhere. so i'm making my life goal to atleast try and achieve the smallest goal i've set for myself (having a job in film/writing) and not have my children worry about the same thing, because we'll be able to pay for a four year college and get them into the industry they want with the friends or connections i've made. and it seems like people around me hate me because i am happy with a guy who wants to be happy with me and i have become rather goal-oriented. i realized that you cant JUST learn from your own mistakes, you can learn from other people's mistakes aswell. and you can learn from their successes too. i don't want to say i am smart, but my family makes me feel like a genius. i don't think smoking weed is the worst thing in the world, but it clouds your judgement immensely, and all of my immediate family smokes weed. 

you can tell me i am full of myself or full of shit or something, i wouldn't mind. but my whole life has called me stupid and i'm just trying to prove people wrong. "
How do yall deal with crippling loneliness when you KNOW u gotta study?,teenagers,1i9u7pe,2025-01-25 14:01:53,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1i9u7pe/how_do_yall_deal_with_crippling_loneliness_when/,Relative_Sock_9109,Serious,"i have these super important exams in 4 days (colloquially called boards in india) for CIE (look it up, its an exam board like College board n stuff) but everytime i sit the thoughts keep getting to me

and then like on instagram n stuff my fyp is filled with sad shit but that fact is its all so fucken true

i have no rizz, have not talked to girls my age in a non-neccesary manner in MONTHS  
absolutely no one is fuckin interested in me

no friends, no one to film me, no one to hand out iwth

i have ppl whom i sit with at school, but out of a grp of 4 ppl the other 3 are superr close-knit and im alwasy the person outsider even tho im right there. im not filled into history that occured between them n like one of them is genuinely a good person, one is mid (in between), and the last one just genuinely seems annoyed

they're all so much more well-connected, richer, happier than me with soo many other firends while outside of that grp i HAVE NO ONE. like i talk to ppl, but no one has every texted me first

i had a talking stage (ig???) with this one girl way back in June '24, but thats sizzled nad i feel so shitty i even though abt my first relationship when shes so much more popular than me and has lots of guy firends (espcitally two that she *always* seems to hang out with)

ive given up on that. i have big dreams that i relly do wanna acheive but my schiity school n classmates and these so called ""friends"" have drained any happiness nad positive outlook i had. ive given it my all to be friends with them but now i legit don't know anyone and i don't think htye rlly even care abt me. Like waiting for you while u pack you bag at dismissial, when you stop to tie your laces, generally being enthusiastic, replying to you whenever u say something, not just one-word answers, actaully engagin in convos with you - its hte little things that rellly matter. I want these ppl to like me so so much because i need it otherwise im cooked and my rare positive moments will be forever gone as i won't even have some facts (i have ppl to eat lunch ig) to calm myself down

legit tearing up almost every damn day, and i know that if i don't lock in ill be cooked and all the shit i hear will come true like a self-fulfilling prophecy. like you know how in that abcdefu song it says ""so you called me a bitch, so i became it"" my situation is kinda sorta like that like i wasn't like this and i KNOW it, but yall have killed the vulnerable inner child i had and its so hard but also nice to just step back from them when we're walking rather that staddling along behind them while everyone else just somehow seems to get into their perfect walking positions

i try SOO hard to be positive and distract myself but ohhh to feel the dopamine hit when someone texts you and actually wants to keep engaging w/ you. i help others with whatever whenever they msg me, but like ive never expeirenced going over for sleepovers (the 3 mentioned earlier had many without me) or like hangouts that i didn't have to suggest and discuss

my friends keep to themselves insidne the broader social web of our school and honestly the ""rich"" of our city also (ig theyre rich cuz i don't know what these ppl do like houseparties?? never been invited nor have a cool enough house for one) (they all have such style and drip n stuff while i try to look good but then my fucked up face shitty build and stuff just are meh) but still they know all the main gossip while i have no idea who theyre talking abt, what gyms or cafes or ""housing societies"" hteyre talking abt n stuff like once the class had no teacher so i got to hear the gossip being spoken n stuff out loud from the cool kids and i was like wtf ohh soo this is the stuff you are able to laguh with everydayy coollll wish i experienced gossip-worthy stuff hahahhaaaaaaaaa. id never head all that otherwise, ik.

ive heard of going to they gym n all but my family isn't rlly modern like that aand there'd be logistical challenges and stuff too and idk if my parents would pay for shit like that and i diont rlly wanna start cuz kids younger than me have such awesome lives and im like what howw??? like my 9th grade was not at all like this

its not like my parents r assholes or anything but they are unbearable sometimes  
i drain so much of my energy navigating through the tiniest points's arguemnets for like hours just so my phone isn't taken, my google account isn't deleted, or im not like severely scolded or hit a little (this post isnt abt the violence tho ig that's just standard india for ya). like my relationship with them is nice but then they say these horribly aggravating things that are so rude and their rebuttal is ""oh so can't you just listen 2 things if your father/ i am saying huh like why do you need to speak against us"" like??? girl im alreayd miserable asf can you NOT demean me for a sec and like how can you be expected to just hear shit of yourself and i hate they joke *about* when i get mad and its so mentally draining  
  
i wanna do extracirriculars as well, but while these guys have fancyshmancy parents and can get interships at the bank their dad works at cuz hes the director or smthg my poordumbass doesn't even know where to start with my useless ass to try and get an internship or somethign good to put into my college application

college is the last chance for me to make good friends, and i rlly hope moving across the world will lemme meet knew good people to know. but like you know sometimes i feel like im the rpoblem only. like even when im not with the usual group or somehow in a situatuion with acquantainces(and no i don't mean friends who im too pretentious/ worried to call firends) i literally just don't know what to say, how to say, what to joke about, how to make references. like it just gets so quiet. and the thing is its worse now because the part of me that i acutally think was more social and fun to be with has died so no i just don't know what to do and its awkward and shi. and i think it only died cuz of the people around me but now its too late for me to change as over the last two years EVERYONE around me has molded me to be this pathetic little shit. i was only good at getting good marks, but now shit is hitting the fan and if i don't have that i don't have anything and i feel so depraved sometimes as I hit new lows and lows theyre like fuckin loneliness milestone yall. and like ik there are poorer ppl than me and ppl whove killed themselves or people who are actively bullied and i do genuinely feel bad for them but like when i wanna use words like traumatizing its sounds too extreme for what im going through cuz i don't want to dilitue the word's significance and screw over the people that NEED it to desrcibe their emotions/experiences but this shit can't be normal mentallly to have to go through.

  
okay.

  
im gonna stop the rant now. if i was saying this out loud instead of typing this, id be bawling rn. shi so traumatizing i can't even cry abt this shit anymore, them tear ducts are dry by now)

back to my title: how exactly do you manage to actively study and memorize when your whole life is sad rn and whenever its quiet your feeling start to creep into your ideas constantly??"

33M, single, never wanted kids. Good for people that want them! It's just not for me.

Personality/interests

* Homebody (most of the time)
* Hobbies: Reading (fantasy/romantasy/sci-fi), board games, tabletops, gaming (a fair variety), anime. Disc golf and some volleyball in the warmer months. Yes, I would identify as a geek/nerd.
* Tend to hang out with friends 1-2x per week mostly year round.
* Try to exercise 4-5x  per week (but I'm not a gym rat, just trying to stay healthy), go to yoga 4-5x per week, and cook most of my own food.
* Depending on present company - introverted introvert or an extroverted introvert (as much as the latter pains me to admit after years of trying to deny it). When I find someone I like talking to, I can chat for hours. You'll know I like you if I give you the Minnesota goodbye.

Other stuff about me

* Financially stable homeowner
* Work from home 99% of the time
* Comfortable with my life/happy being single, but looking for someone to add to it.
* Independent: I don't tend to *need* people around, but I *want* them around. Everything is better with friends (and hopefully you ;) ). Still an introvert that needs solo relaxing time though.
* I drink socially but rarely at home. I don't smoke and am not interested in someone who does.
* Not super big into traveling, sorry to all the world explorers out there! I don't mind traveling if there's an event I want to go to or something, but traveling just to go sightsee, etc. doesn't really do it for me for the most part. I wouldn't mind the occasional trip and would have no problem if you wanted to do more traveling solo or with other people though.
* I generally like to meet people in person relatively quickly when I can (so bonus points if you're somewhat nearby and/or willing to video chat). I find it better than letting conversation fizzle out over text. Don't let that dissuade you if you are far away or need a little more time though, it's just a preference.

I think that covers all the basics. Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you're interested, send me a message with a little about yourself and what attracted you to my post. I probably won't respond to only ""Hey"" or ""Hello"".

Picked up my new hat today. For is fairly good. Mesh construction at the back will help keep cool in warmer weather, although that’s rarely an issue for the UK. 

Hat also came with a free bow. I’m swapping over from a 2024 Darton Exodus which is a good bow, but I’ve never managed to get comfortable with the grip (feels too wide and blocky for a repeatable grip). 

Setup out of the box was ok. Shooting 28.5” CDM mod, 70% let off, and -1/8” 4° grip to get it back to 28.5” draw. Took one twist on the cables to get the cams in time from factory (bottom was leading), and naturally a couple of twists to get the peep rotating properly, but basic setup stuff that doesn’t take long. Peep seemed stable after I’d finished, but will keep an eye on it for any further twist. Grip is super comfortable, and extremely repeatable. It’s slim, I think slimmer than my old Ultra Elite, but very nice. 

Set to 54.5lbs (fully wound in was 61.1lbs), and took about 3 turns out. Rest set on dead centre shot and a clean paper tear.

As to feel of the cams, draw cycle is fairly stiff, but drops nicely into the valley and feels like it’s less effort to shoot compared to the Darton. It also felt a ton more stable at full draw, sight picture much quieter, even with bodged stabilisers. The 5/16” threads are shorter than the Darton meaning the bolts I had on hand were too long; ended up running my side rod off the same thread as the longrod. It worked though. 

Looking forward to getting some range time in tomorrow to properly put it through its paces. "

Background: 
My(32) wife(40) and I have been together for a little over ten years married for 5 we have an almost 2 year old. We both work at the same company, but I have a Monday-Friday job, and her schedule is just chaos sometimes she has days off during the week, sometimes she works weekends, and as daycare is closed Saturday and Sunday I am home with the tot. 

We rarely fight about things, we are both usually pretty good about it’s a new day, forgetting any fights or disagreements that happened the day before. She’s never been a morning person, I knew that when I married her, when we found out she was pregnant she quit cigarettes but kept smoking weed from time to time for stress. She doesn’t have any medical issues. 

Now the issue: we have a toddler and the kid likes to wake up at 6 in the morning which I have no problem getting up with him. However then she will sleep til 9-10 o’clock. Then she’ll wake up and doom scroll on her social medias and TikTok til 11 when it’s time to get him lunch. She puts him down for nap, he’s kind of a mamas boy so when she’s home he wants her. When I have him when she works I have no problem getting him to nap. Then she’s back outside smoking cigarettes(which I just found out 2 months ago she had picked up that habit again) and weed or she’ll go out shopping or see her friends. The kid only sleeps for about an hour which is t enough time for me to paint or really commit to a hobby. Then I’m hanging out with him while she doom scrolls some more. If I get on my phone she huffs and puffs and makes a big deal about me being on it. Then she’s back outside before supper and after super and after he goes to bed. 

To summarize, I just feel like I am putting in more than my fair share of parenting, I feel like I never really have time for hobbies when I am constantly in charge of hanging out with him. On weekdays when she is off she drops him off  at daycare and sleeps til noon or even longer sometimes. She’ll do laundry and dishes but no other housework. All of my days off I have the kid around and he won’t let me clean or do any hobby work. I get done what I can but it’s not much. I feel all this resentment building up more and more and I don’t know what to do with it. 

And the cherry on top is sometimes she’ll come to me crying about not having enough time to spend with him! He’s growing up so fast! If I comment at all it’s instantly more waterworks and I’m a bad person for pointing that out. "

"What does the term ""10 Experience"" mean in training?",KickboxingUnderground,1i9rspr,2025-01-25 12:17:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KickboxingUnderground/comments/1i9rspr/what_does_the_term_10_experience_mean_in_training/,StrengthUnderground,,"One thing I learned by owning a gym, and it applies to other types of businesses as well, particularly service businesses.... is that it's not just about ""the product"" or ""the service""... it's about the whole ""EXPERIENCE"" a person had while in your establishment.

When you're training, you want all of your workouts to be a ""10"".  A 10 is when it feels like there's no real room for improvement.  There were no deficiencies noted.  You're not thinking about what didn't go well.  All you're thinking about is, ""Wow!  That was awesome!  I had such a great workout!""

A 10 is rare.

But it doesn't have to be.  There is a way to make sure that happens, whether you're training yourself or training a client.  And really, it's not so much about what you're DOING, it's more about what you're NOT doing.

The essence is the ""flow state"".  We all know what that is.  It's where you forget about the outside world... its pressures, its concerns, its worries.... and you lose track of everything outside of what you're doing at this very moment.   You lose track of time.

In our world... these kickboxing training sessions...you are totally immersed into the training.  One round of fighting is flowing into the next.  There are 2 key ingredients that make that happen:

\- the quality of the training method AND the disciplines of the System.  The ""Rules"" if you will.

The Rules (Instructions) sound a little knitpicky.   They sound pretty rigid and inflexible.

And to be honest, yeah they are.  But there are so few of them.  And they are each CRUCIAL.   

Some of the rules are:  turn off your notifications on your phone.  Don't take calls, check your messages, or handle your phone while training.

Tell me how you're going to be in a flow state for 45 minutes or an hour yet you are checking your messages, trying to record videos of your training, answering a quick phone call, etc?

You HAVE to tune out the outside world.  When you enter the training environment, that IS your world.  For an hour.

When outside worries or concerns try to invade your mental space, you quickly shake them off  your head and refocus.

When you are doing with your session and have followed the simple rules, every workout will be a 10.  Sometimes they could actually be a 7 or an 8, like when you've eaten too recently and have food jostling around in your stomach and you feel kind of nauseous or sluggish during the workout.   But typically, if your body is not an issue, you will have a 10 experience.  Your clients too.

It's that 10 experience that keeps your clients coming back; it's what invites them to refer people to you.

They'll look forward to their workouts, rather than dread them.  And of course, all the benefits that come from the training session will be theirs too, and paramount is the stress relief that comes at the end of the workout.

I should also mention:   it helps to give yourself a buffer of 15 minutes AFTER the workout where you are still not checking your phone.  I know this is super difficult, and as a trainer you may actually have to because of appt scheduling, confirmations, etc.   But your client should stay off their phones.   Advise them to.   They should drive home basking in the stress relief that came from the session.   It's a HUGE extra benefit, but can only be had by those with enough impulse control and self discipline to ignore the outside concerns for the drive home.   All my clients have said they LOVE their drive home.  It's almost supernatural.

My (22MtF) sister (24F) has become a religious extremist. Is there a way to salvage my relationship with her?,relationship_advice,1i9rrid,2025-01-25 12:15:42,0,0.33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9rrid/my_22mtf_sister_24f_has_become_a_religious/,TatteroleTotterole,,"This is a bit of a mess, and I'm liable to ramble, so apologies if this is super long or not the most coherent. I also ask that people be respectful of all individuals involved; I get you may have differing opinions of anyone or everyone than I do, but I'll ignore anything super disrespectful aimed towards anyone, including myself.

Tl;dr: I'm a trans woman. My sister converted to Islam, and since then has fallen to more and more radical and extreme views, which have resulted in a complete rejection and only barely subtle attempts to influence me to detransition, which I refuse to do. This, alongside her other extreme political views, causes tension and interactions that are unbearable for me, and I want to see if there's some way to salvage things, as we had a very close relationship growing up and I don't want to lose it. However, there's a lot of complications.

A lot of context. As kids, ""Anne"" and I were very close. We have different dads, but she typically only spent a couple days a week with him, which meant that we spent the majority of our time together. During this time, her biological dad was purportedly regularly abusive; she has hinted towards it but refuses to ever be specific, while my mom has had very specific and consistent accusations about him, although the more extreme ones were not substantiated by Anne yet, and despite CPS being called he never fully lost custody of her. I suspect them to be true, but regardless her dad was at the very least physically abusive with her as a child.

Things were not great on my mom's side of things, either. She and my dad were flawed but good parents until I was about 10 years old/until Anne was about 12 years old. Then, it came out that my dad cheated on our mom with his 15 years younger coworker, and our mom turned to the whole gambit--abused vicodin and adderall, left home for days at a time, refused to pay bills which resulted in our electricity being shut off multiple times, and at her worst she'd bash holes into the drywall and throw plates around. My dad, meanwhile, was hardly present and moved back in with his mom, and both parents used us as vessels to attack each other by forcing us to act as couriers for their communication, which caused them to feel further resentment towards us. (As perhaps the most extreme example: my dad had a ""mild"" heart attack, as he described it. My mom sent me over to his house to ask him for $60 during this time because she needed gas and food money. Dad was unhappy with this request, and I'm all but certain mom did it on purpose to twist the knife into him without a single care as to how it would impact me.)

We have an older brother, but he's 12 years older than me/10 older than Anne, and had a whole bunch of his own issues, so he was rarely present. As a result, we primarily relied on each other to stay functional. We were catty and could be downright mean to each other as all siblings could, but she was the person I was closest to, and we trusted each other with a lot. In the most extreme example of us working together, we were left home alone for three days straight, and not a single person outside of the home could tell. We took care of our pets, made sure the other ate and bathed and did their homework, and made it work.

In the middle of all this came one of the big pieces in this conversation: Anne came out as nonbinary. Our parents were confused, but not wholly unaccepting. This gave me the courage to, around a year later when I was 14, come out to my parents as a trans woman. To her credit, my mom was immediately supportive, and has remained so since. My dad said some choice things (he said it was about as shocking as it would've been if I had said I was a nazi, which was... unideal, to say the least) but he mostly cooled down after about a year and has since become a fairly ardent supporter of me and trans people as a whole. I credit Anne with giving me the courage to come out in the first place, and acting as the initial shock to let my parents understand and accept me better than they did her. Meanwhile, my coming out normalized Anne's being nonbinary to them, so it was ultimately working out.

Things then took a downturn. A few months before her 17th birthday, Anne attempted suicide. It was bad. She was admitted into residency at various places, and spent ~8 months before she got out. The suicide attempt and subsequent residencies changed her a fair bit. Anne decided that she wanted to become religious.

This isn't unprecedented or inherently negative by any means, and I don't want to imply that religion is fundamentally bad. Furthermore, I don't want to imply that Islam specifically is fundamentally bad. All religions have people who use it to be better people, and people who use it to justify extremist beliefs. Meanwhile, Anne's radicalization did not come from her in-person experiences; I talked to the Imam and various members of the mosque she goes to, and although they're all fairly conservative, none of them hold (or at least are bold enough to publicly espouse) super extremist views like my sister has. I believe that Anne's already present fear of hell (our mom was a bit of a hardcore orthodox Christian growing up, so we both got left with that) was amplified by her suicide attempt and subsequent absence from society as a whole, and as a result she turned towards extreme religious zealotry and fringe radical thought to cope.

To start with, she detransitioned within a year of converting, and fully embraced being seen as a woman through and through, despite admitting to still having dysphoria. She quickly went from a bit camera shy to refusing to show anything but her eyes in public, and refusing to ever have any sort of picture taken of her. She cut off any media that had any references to magic, sex, or a focus on gray or flexible morals. She's tried to convert our entire family, and cried to our mom because she believes that she wouldn't be able to attend her funeral, as our mom will not convert and thus will end up in hell. This last one seems to be a particularly cruel attempt to manipulate our mom, be it intentionally cruel or not.

She started espousing extreme political beliefs, including absolutely bizarre ones: she believes democracy is a failure and should be replaced in the US with a theocratic government, although she is still very much a pacifist, which makes the mechanisms of this belief somewhat confusing. She strongly wishes to move to Saudi Arabia, and believes countries should model themselves off of it, including its highly repressive views towards women. When I visited family with my now-husband, she talked extensively with him about her extreme pro death penalty stance and her disagreement with ""transgenderism,"" despite this being the first time she met my very clearly trans boyfriend. We were on the topic of concerns towards people living in Arizona due to climate change, and for some fucking reason she decided that the best thing to do would be to mass migrate the entire population of the state by force, and imprison those that don't want to leave, even if they have historical ties to the land or have children. I still have no fucking idea where that thought came from, or how she justifies it in her head.

She also has, as mentioned previously, backpedaled heavily on any support of trans people. She refuses to call people by their chosen name if she knows their legal name, she refuses to use the correct pronouns and will make a point to use the incorrect ones when they're around. She very pointedly called me her brother multiple times, refused to use my name, referred to me as male in every single way possible, and generally made it miserable to talk to her.

This came to a head at the beginning of March last year, where I attempted suicide. There were several factors involved, such as uniquely miserable working conditions and severe isolation from those I care about, but an unavoidable part of it was intense gender dysphoria. The biggest issue with my dysphoria was my sister, who had previously given me the courage to come out and had done all she could to support me, now rescinding her support and not-so-subtly attempting to get me to detransition.

I've taken steps to improve my mental health since then, and although things are still rough, I'm doing better than I was last year. In an attempt to further make things better, I had a heart to heart with Anne last July. I explained the reasons for my attempt, and all but begged her to try to see things from my perspective and give me even a modicum of respect, even just by using the right name for me. Her response, verbatim, was: ""I would have done almost anything for you."" She then insisted that I admit myself to a psychiatric facility for a long term residency, despite me just talking about how my support network was pretty much the sole reason I was able to drag myself out of the hole I was in.

This hurt. At the time, I attempted to cut her out of my life. However, I can't bring myself to straight up go no contact, and she keeps barging back in. Our mom insists that I repair my relationship with her. Things are further complicated by the fact that I moved in with my mom late last year to ease the financial burden my husband and I were facing, and Anne visits her twice a week, every week, and stays for hours at a time. The thought of having to hide in my room to avoid her makes me feel like a child, but continuing to play nice with her and pretend that we're all better now kind of fucking sucks. I can't very well kick her out when this is my mom's place first and foremost, and she has a right to see all of her children at her home. Anne has, at the very least, started using a nickname for my chosen name; however, it's also a nickname for my legal name, and given what she said and how she acted previously, it's hard not to see this as yet another way for her to refuse giving me even the most basic form of respect.

I understand this is a lot of stuff probably best talked about with a therapist, and I'll be getting one as soon as I can. Until then, I'm struggling to find a way to somehow repair things with her without accepting her disrespect of me and all the negative effects that come with it. I still love her a lot, and I still want her in my life if I'm able to somehow salvage things with her. My husband, however, believes the best choice is to go low contact and tolerate her until we're able to cut her out entirely, which I understand may be the only way forward. I just want to see if anyone has any thoughts to anything else I could do before making that call."

It's a very rare occurrence and typically has happened in laboratory settings. 

Dr. April Davis did a spectacular job conducting this study. One of my favorite things that the researchers did was capture wild bats, quarantine them for 6 to 8 months, and used them as one of the animal models. Dr. Davis' thought processes for this study are mind blowing. It's super cool that she chose the two bat species, Big Brown (Eptesicus fuscus, most common bat in north America) and Mexican free tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis).  Big Brown bats are also the most commonly tested bat species for rabies virus in the USA (CDC, 2023). All the bats survived the exposure of rabies and even started producing rabies neutralizing antibodies, while some of the mice succumbed to rabies. Bats also were monitored 6 months after being exposed and did not have much protection when serology was performed. 

What are your thoughts on this study? I personally love this. I work with bats and rabies virus and I think this was an amazing way to test aerosolized exposure in a safe environment.

I don’t know / remember all the right terms for stuff so please bare with me if I get stuff wrong. 

I feel as though I have “subsystems(?)” which are sort of like… alters within alters, or grouped into alters that are very similar to eachother, and switching within this “group” doesn’t seem to cause any super noticeable physical side effects, but switching from one “group” to another seems to cause extreme fatigue, derealisation and brain fog for a prolonged period of time.

I rarely switch between these groups, it’s likely that one “group” will be “host” for a long time, up to a year maybe? And only switch between that group then when eventually a switch happens to a totally different “alter” it’s like it kills my body and brain for weeks and I need to totally readjust. I might also have some kind of physical disorder that causes fatigue but I noticed that the more drastically different the “alters” are, the more of an effect it has on physical health.

Is it normal to have these sorts of groups & has anyone experienced anything like this before? Also sorry for putting stuff in quotation marks but I feel guilty calling it alters and stuff when I’m not diagnosed so it’s just to alleviate my own guilt

The Three Main Men All Display Character Regression as the Show Went On.,fullhouse,1i9qlbo,2025-01-25 11:25:02,8,0.9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fullhouse/comments/1i9qlbo/the_three_main_men_all_display_character/,Hamiltonfan25,Show Discussion,"Granted, a lot of this can be attributed to the fact that this show is a sitcom/comedy and a lot of times the characters are more or less doing what the plot demands.

It is just so jarring because we see so much growth and expansion of the girls as they get older. It makes sense, childhood is a time of darn near constant development, but once you become an adult that development slows down significantly as you go through your mundane daily life. It can be easy for adults to become accustom to a variety of situations because your brains are pretty much done expanding, so it tries to compensate by seeking things that are routine and (more or less predictable).

A few examples I can come up with are moments like when Joey went from this guy who on surface level seems shallow, but who shows so much care for others, yet still has a backbone and demands respect from others and who knows just how to make someone feel better when they need it most, to a spineless jellyfish who can’t even be bothered to demand that Danny respect his gift to the older girls. Or literally playing his favorite sport like a wussy because he can’t help Michelle understand what’s real and what is just putting on an act.

Then, Danny goes from being this tough but fair father who tries his very best to do right by his daughters (with OCCASIONAL bias towards the baby of the family) and who does what he can to mold them into the best possible adults to a guy who let his eight year old have the final say on where they live.

He also went from defending DJ’s right to privacy to HIM PERSONALLY reading her personal notes and refusing to allow her privacy on a literal date.

Jesse, to me, is simultaneously given the most growth as a character, while also displaying some of the worst regression in the series. On the growth side of things, you see him have this super flippant attitude towards devoting his time (and his pride) towards raising the daughters. They make it perfectly clear that Jesse was not comfortable with the chaotic family life that he was thrusts into and that he had a lot of maturing to do. It is rewarding by the end of the series to see how much he’s grown since moving in. He proves himself to be a great family man who legit enjoys his life and his family (while still keeping parts of his own unique personality).

But then you have episodes where he’s yelling at a bunch of 12/13 year old girls because they aren’t taking their music seriously enough for him. Or how his entire personality was suddenly changed and was replaced with his Greek heritage. His mention of Pam being his sister got more and more rare (and yes, I understand that the longer that she’s gone, naturally he’s going to slowly start talking about her less and less. I don’t have a problem with that. I have a problem with giving him multiple episodes exploring his family where Pam doesn’t come up once).

I also believe that the show really wants to give Jesse a prominent arch of going from this single bachelor who only thinks about himself, into this fantastic family man, but it just doesn’t work as a complete piece to me. Yes, he grows up in a lot of ways, AND some of his bad moments can be attributed to his family letting HIM down (like any time the family wanted to shame him for trying to be a steady provider for his family), but he still shows so many moments where he’s shown being absolutely clueless. 

Like the episode where he tries to force DJ and Stephanie to give Michelle one of their toys as an incentive to not be jealous of the new baby. This includes trying to get Stephanie to give Michelle Mr. Bear, despite KNOWING he’s a keepsake from Pam, AND there being an entire episode about trying to get him to empathize with Stephanie’s attachment to him. Even taking the trauma out of the equation, Jesse’s parents reminded him that he once had a toy that was just as special to him (and that he still remembers fondly as an adult as evidenced by him recounting exactly how he used to play with him).

Yeah, he did something similar with Stephanie’s pink bunnies by taking them down and giving Michelle one of the bunnies in a frame BUT that was different because Stephanie no longer showed any attachment to them. She still made it obvious that she still felt attached to Mr Bear but Jesse still forcibly placed her in a situation where she felt pressured to give him away."
Leather face; the baby brother of the Slaughter Family,TexasChainsawGame,1i9qg9q,2025-01-25 11:18:53,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TexasChainsawGame/comments/1i9qg9q/leather_face_the_baby_brother_of_the_slaughter/,tranaconda,Discussion (TCM)," The poster boy and deadliest threat of the game able to one shot most but two shot at the worst. Definite game changer and the only person almost to solo carry games. Then again his kit serves its purpose but the top of the tree got only 1 is instant activation is highly useful to the point it’s the only one to use 100% of all bubba mains. Here is a purpose changes I could suggest.

Left tree I like to see is demolition side where he has a heavy duty chainsaw mod destroy everything faster with walk gaps also destroyed and rarely stalls but at a cost of raving it 1 pump and move speed about -5%. Super loud to victims know what tree he going for.

Middle is his undebatable that instant rev is good. Rarely offer different gameplay so it stays as it is.

Right side should be a muffler attach it with lower proximity aura on victims. May be a lighter chassis to run abit faster and instant stall on over head. Should put on jump scares back in game.

The way up is mostly just over heat and one path just stall resistance. The path should be from left to right would love to have is about overhead damage, stall resistance, and serration damage (no over head to proc this unless top right tree is maxed).
Then why would you have blood lust as his unique perk with not DoT makes it pretty useless 1/million blue moon it would work."
Looking at which type is the best OFFENSIVE pairing with the Ghost type,stunfisk,1i9qffi,2025-01-25 11:17:52,71,0.96,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/1i9qffi/looking_at_which_type_is_the_best_offensive/,DJ_Tile_Turnip,Discussion,"Ghost is a very interesting offensive type. A powerful one, certainly, with its impeccable neutral coverage, though it lacks in many super effective hits and strong attacks. This fact may influence ranking what types Ghosts want as coverage moves. Say you have a Ghost type with its own STAB move, what type of attack do you want for the best coverage move?

  
17th: Dark

Dark and Ghost are so similar that the combination of them is nigh useless. Ghost only has trouble against Normal and Dark types, and Normal is covered by every type, but Dark is not helping against opposing Dark types. Super effectively, Dark adds nothing- it's still just Psychic and Ghost. Even the moves don't go well together: Poltergeist + Knock Off is anti-synergy and Shadow Ball + Dark Pulse is just 2 weak attacks.

  
16th: Psychic

Psychic is another type that does absolutely nothing into the Dark types that stop Ghost, in fact having no effect at all. However, Psychic is better than Dark because it at least gives you a couple of super effective hits.

  
15th: Poison

There are now many types which tie for being neutral against Normal and Dark, and Poison ranks at the bottom of them. It lacks in super effective hits and especially neutral coverage against the array of dual typed Pokemon.

  
14th: Grass

Ghost + Grass has the most Pokemon out there which are able to resist it out of this group, leaving it ranking quite low. It at least has decent super effective hits, so there's that.

  
13th: Electric

Electric is pretty poor in terms of adding super effective hits, but it is considerably less commonly walled than Grass.

  
12th: Normal

Although Normal type coverage is actually quite rare to wall (Tyranitar and Kingambit would like to have a word with you), the fact it adds 0 super effective help to Ghost makes it pretty undesirable.

  
11th: Dragon

Ghost and Dragon function quite similarly offensively, being powerhouses neutrally. As such, it's actually not helpful to combine them unless it's a dual STAB. Dragon does boast a single super effective hit, 1 higher than Normal can provide.

  
10th: Steel

Steel gives you 3 super effective hits and is generally not walled by too many Pokemon, not much more to add.

  
9th: Flying

The Flying type is pretty good offensively and it combined with Ghost is walled by fewer Pokemon than Steel, while also providing solid super effective hits.

  
8th: Water

Similar to Dragon, Water coverage is adding a powerful neutral type to Ghost. The Pokemon that can stop Ghost/Water are actually quite few, and Water is much better than Dragon when it comes to super effective hits.

  
7th: Ice

With 4 whole newfound super effective hits, Ghost types really appreciate this boon in their offensive arsenal.

  
6th: Fire

Fire, likewise, is providing a solid 4 types of super effective coverage and is walled by the same number of Pokemon as Ice. Fire is better into the omnipresent Steel types, Kingambit particularly.

  
5th: Bug

Bug is very interesting, as it's actually super effective against the Dark types that resist Ghost! However, because of how lacking Bug is as an offensive type otherwise, it actually ends up around as commonly walled as most other types. Still, most of the dual types which resist Ghost + Bug are relegated to a single evolution line each, aside from Normal/Flying.

  
4th: Rock

Ghost/Rock coverage has some of the fewest resists out of them all and also provide some superb super effective coverage. The only flaw is that you're either a physical Ghost type or a special Rock type, whose moves each have issues.

  
3rd: Ground

Being the absolute best at patching up for super effective hits of all the types, with 5 new ones, as well as being one of the best in terms of neutral coverage, it's no surprise Ground ranks highly.

  
2nd: Fairy

Alright but now we get to territory that is just leaps and bounds above the rest. Ghost/Fairy is fantastic with both a super effective hit against opposing Dark types and being incredibly hard to wall.

  
1st: Fighting

Not a single other type has had Normal type necessary to mention, but notably here Fighting is super effective against those Normals that block Ghost moves, AND Dark types which resist them. If that wasn't good enough, the only fully evolved Pokemon who can beat this combination is Zoroark-Hisui. It's clearly the best, no contest."

So naturally I just find swearing strange or out of place. I will occasionally swear here and there but it’s nothing compared to my friends at college or frankly everyone else. When people talk to me for the first time I always get a sense that they belittle me or see me as if I am younger or more innocent than them. Which is not the case at all. I think just like them or act similarly I just don’t share with the world me deepest or private thoughts like they do so openly.

randomly developed sleeptalking,sleep,1i9pk6o,2025-01-25 10:39:48,4,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1i9pk6o/randomly_developed_sleeptalking/,Relevant-Judge2887,,"I’m 18 years old and very recently started sleep talking. i don’t think i ever used to up until recently and I’m unsure if i should worry. it rarely happens but I’ve experienced catching myself sleep talking three times. the first instance i was at my boyfriends house spending the night, he was playing video games super late so i decided id drift off and go to sleep. i started saying pick-axe in my sleep (maybe i thought he was playing fortnite idfk) and he responded with “what?” so we went back and forth, me saying pick-axe and him saying “what?”. i kept saying pick-axe not even knowing why i was saying it. i felt very confused. the second instance is not sleep talking but more of doing in action while laying in bed. i woke up to myself spitting on my pillow. not slobber but genuinely spitting as if i were spitting food out or something of the sort. it woke me up and i freaked out confused as to why i would do that. the third instance happened today and freaked me out really bad. i woke myself up whispering the words “id kill myself” in the middle of the night. i look around my room and decide i feel like im not alone and someone is in my room watching me (i have a background of having paranoia) and turn my LED lights on until i check around my room and see nobody is there so i just lock my door to ensure no one can enter. TLDR i just have random sleep talking/doing that started out of nowhere and it gives me feelings of fear and confusion and i want to know what could cause this or if anyone has any similar experiences because it really affects my quality of sleep."
I hate school,Vent,1i9pfxq,2025-01-25 10:34:26,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i9pfxq/i_hate_school/,West-Strain-1445,,"Yes, I am a crybaby snowflake crying unnecessarily. I don't care what you think and you are free to think and downvote this post. But when almost all of your negativity stems from one thing, something is actually wrong.

School was the worst thing that happened to me. My school life is almost over now, and I have always irrationally disliked school, but when I realised how it affected and turned me into a big loser, I burned with so much hate.

I remembered how I was when I was a child. Super confident. Didn't cared what others think. I looked unrecognisable back then.

School butchered my confidence, my self esteem, made me very insecure, and tried to kill my creativity. 

Maybe humiliating a kid in front of everyone isn't creating another future legend. I didn't cared about it most of the time, but it slowly made me more hesitant and I felt like a sheep in a slaughterhouse, like a slave. What could I had done about it back then my age was in single digit. Thank you school, your repetitive insults made me capable of holding unhealthy grudges. I now irrationally feel like skinning my people alive and I can't stop it.

Look at the kids who are indisciplined, yes they are annoying fuckers but teachers literally tend to demoninse them so many times. I wasn't in that place for most of my school life, but when I was 12 I got enrolled in a new school. I was sincere, but I wanted friends so badly back then. So I turned into a kind of like bully but not really bullied anyone kind of guy, just to make more friends. And it worked. But on the other hand now I was getting detentions, suspended. No that frequently though. But then I repeatedly tried to be a better student, yet no teacher couldn't see me other than a child demon. So I remained that. 

I was good with theory, but very bad with assignments. I almost never submitted my assignments on time. I wanted help so badly but everytime I asked for it they would tell me to fuck off or said okay so I will beat tf out of you if you didn't completed your assignment. Fun fact, if you tell a 10 year old that you will beat him instead of helping him with care he will be scared and won't ask for your help. Shocking? Thank you, now I have no social life. Now I am a fucking procrastinater, and I have no energy, not that same level of burning interest in the thing I loved so much anymore. Now I feel like wandering mindlessly.

I hated how I was labelled as misogynist a lot of time, JUST BECAUSE I COULDN'T TALK TO GIRLS LIKE WTF I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I DON'T HATE THEM SHUT UP

And school wasn't my learning place too. Class based learning never helped, and I wasn't even bad at academics. Most of my learning came from internet, when kids my age were on Tiktok I was learning about Science and History. It drastically improved my academics. Even for other subjects I would resort to internet.

School never did me favour for most part, but only made me worse.

I no longer talk to anyone about anything personal, but rarely resort to means where I feel like talking to a wall, like here. You are people, but in front of me.

I will be adult and am a man-child now with no goals.

The way I wrote it, it will seem that I am just a crybaby snowflake or cloutbaiting. But I am not used to speak out my feelings. Please don't say anything, just downvote and move on."

Kitten Put on a Diet?,CATHELP,1i9p69f,2025-01-25 10:21:42,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1i9p69f/kitten_put_on_a_diet/,_WendyBird_,,"I have a male kitten who is just about 7 months old. He was neutered almost 3 weeks ago. When I first got him, he had worms and anything we fed him was just going straight through. He still has some digestive things, but he isn't defecating constantly like before, which has been awesome. Two of the vets have said that they think he is overweight. I think around the 6 month mark he was over 7lbs, probably closer to 8 than not. They have asked me to put him on a 225cal/day diet and ""if we end up seeing his ribs we have gone too far the other way"". He is super active - I think he sleeps probably on average is 10 hrs a day (7-8 through the night which is a blessing and maybe 2ish in the daytime). I am worried that he is really hungry. He walks around and cries constantly sometimes. We play with him and give him lots of attention, and I work from home so he is rarely alone at all. He goes absolutely NUTS when it is feeding time yelling and running around our legs. He eats super fast and then yells for a while after expecting more. He WILL leave some of the kibble on occasion even though, so there is some self control. He paces around the kitchen thinking about how to get up on the counters. Every time we are in the kitchen, he thinks he is also getting food. He sometimes tries to get to our food when we are eating and sometimes distracting him with interactive toys doesn't work - he will still beg for food. His obsession with food just seems to be SO much worse since the 225cal limit. He was getting about 275-370cal/day before the diet suggestion, depending on how hungry he seemed on the day to day (the variation was based on how much of a can of his wet food he would get in a day). Is 225cal/day enough for a growing 7-month-old kitten? I feel really bad and feel like he is very hungry. He is also a chewer, which I worry some of it is some pica. We spread out the feeding into like 4 meals and 2 tiny autofeeder snacks a day. He also has a handsome primordial pouch already that is very fluffy, but I personally don't think he otherwise looks fat. You can see his waist from above, feel his ribs running fingers along etc. A vet tech told me she disagrees with the vets and thinks he is perfect (pre diet). I am at my wits end a bit."
Someone please convince me on Kasparas,NBA_Draft,1i9p57f,2025-01-25 10:20:20,21,0.9,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/1i9p57f/someone_please_convince_me_on_kasparas/,Jamie-----,,"The production is incredible. The vision and off-the-dribble shooting are elite. Super crafty drawing fouls. Love the size. Generally love the creativity, processing, and legit lead guard disposition. And I'm not concerned about turnovers - I love to see prospects testing the limits while young. 

But does he have the driving ability to weaponize the pass, pull-up, and foul drawing? What gives us confidence he can beat great athletes off the bounce? 

Who's an elite NBA guard with equally poor burst and quickness? Is he the rare exception because he's just so good that he can just crush in PnR? 

The bar on offense is high for a top 5 pick that projects as a negative defender. I want to believe!

Later,it turned out he was funny, mature, understanding and an amazing guy this whole time.Even tho we had known eachother for 3.5 months but it felt like years.

After back and forth texting for like 1 month, in Nov, we confessed that we liked eachotther.He would rarely flirt with me, more like love bomb me sometimes. I felt like he had this ""meye toh already potey gese, efforts diye ki hobe!"" Vibe(I confessed first). This whole time he never once asked me out on a date. He told me that he had some past traumas from his previous relationships, I gave him time for that. 

Last Sunday he confessed that he got ""feelings"" for me over text and I told him that I wanted him to confess atleast over call or irl and he said he wasn't ready to do it yet. I said ""It's okay then do it when you are ready"". AND he expected me to confess back. But I didn't. And as we both wanted a serious relationship, to make the next move, for me, I had to meet him a couple of times and then finally decide. He didn't expect to hear a ""No"" from me. Once again he was like ""I'm not ready to go on a date"" and I said ""it's okay"" and tried reassuring him.

Everything was alright, said goodnights, went to sleep. Next day, I came back home at 6pm, super sick, went to sleep and woke up around 11pm and No text from him. But he posted a story and a note an hour ago. Normally he would send texts or reels and I would come back home and reply to those and if ik that he was busy, I would do those. Figured out that he was ignoring me after confessing the day before. Gave him another day and still no text from him. And finally on tuesday I blocked him from EVERYWHERE without any words.

Now a part of me is guilty that I could've texted him and asked what's wrong. But another part of me is angry at him at the fact that I didn't deserve to be treated like that. Now the fact that I'm constantly checking my phone for a call or anything is making me feel so pathetic that I can't describe.I'm so anxious and frustrated all the time and this whole thing is so overwhelming for me. How should I deal with this situation?

(Long as paragraph! Ik. Sorry about that and posting about my personal issue is weird ik but I was feeling so lost. TIA)

First time posting here,worldbuilding,1i9oct2,2025-01-25 09:42:20,50,0.97,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9oct2,n1trous_Xpress,Lore,"Lore: year is 3477 a plague called ""urus virus"" has been ravaging neighboring states civilians and all nations of  austrum hexadia are fighting for power over the weakened nations dealing the virus. And the leader of the krux ""jarles von Ormy"" has been assassinated by a  S.S.A (superior state agency) member. and from the chaos of the plague rises the second order war... 

STATE EMPIRE,ARMARIDIAN STATE REPUBLICANS,EMPERIALIST STATE EMPIRE : centuries old an overly powered nation combined together into an unstoppable force. The russia of the austrum hexadia  dictators controlling and manipulating the poor and the weak with their propaganda to Manning gigantic industrial weapon factorys and fighting meaningless wars just for all for the emperors entertainment. always making weapons of war from atomic guided missiles to super destructive lasers. often taking part in almost all controversial events. even betraying smaller nations and committing hundreds of surrendered civilian killings and war crimes. Their grounds covered in gigantic fortresses and strongholds that stretches for miles 

KRUX: formed after the first order warmainlyc managed by rebels and people who found out the state empires brainwashing hands often  stealing the states secret weapons and making weapons of their own. It is the only nation who can go toe to toe against the state empire

Krixus rebellion: a rebellion against a rebellion. controlled by smaller bands of state patriots and unkown rebel bandwagons

The fallen order: a mysterious and dark nation rumored to have dragons tucked into their caves and giants with epic proportions roaming their land managed by medieval like ancient people who know how to arm themselves with modern weapons

Astra congrador emperium: a relatively weak and little bit strongn nations that was mainly being used as a trade route from neighboring states that has been turned into a paradise of rebel skirmishesando rebel uprisings

Nitron emperium: as futuristic ancient ""mechanoids"" that has been discovered by the state empire managed by ancient mech people who have the strongest arsenal of weaponry and often defying logic and physics with their strange element littered in their lands called ""elgarmentium"" thats so rare that even national leaders would sacrifice their high ranking soldiers to get their hands on the element

Sinoprium: the little brother of the Astra congrador that's mainly the entire army of the Astra. Sinoprium and astra are the first to get attacked by the state empire because they got framed for ""assassinating the krux leader"" and then led to the war

Shigaru states: an Asian nation combined and sharing supplies together during the first order war and an old friend of the jacked mountains and is the second neutral nation

Jacked mountains: coming from  mysterious Asian dimension that adapted the art of making break through technology weaponrys back when the first and second war happened. Maintained by high elite generals that have strong bond with their soldiers and also the enemies of every nation

Sastala tranza: first to be captured back in first order war by the both the state and the krux but they got released by both of them after what the state and krux thought was going to an easy take over was it was a year long stalemate against each other and a huge waste of resources and men. Maintained by a small surviving government and being threatened to support the krux 

Sebasta union: the smallest nation in austrum hexadia maintained by the S.A.G.A (sebasta union Government agencies) and has a relatively strong army for a small nation but still neutral

Iron union: same centuries old and a fighting force and a right handman of the state empire having the strongest walls that stood back in the first order war and stronghold fortesses that scatter across the barren wasteland of the state empire

Chaktra takista:a terrorist and a illed nation that got it's governments killed during a massive riot that marked the nations downfall maintained by the fallen order because of the chaktra terrorists tries to invade the fallen orders territory

My (24f) best friend (24f) wants to date my brother (30m) who molested me as a kid. Should I tell her?,trauma,1i9obao,2025-01-25 09:40:18,3,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1i9obao/my_24f_best_friend_24f_wants_to_date_my_brother/,ComedianCautious887,,"I don't want to make this a super long post, but it might be a bit of a read. My brother will be B, my friend with be F. basically my brother and I were always very close. Unfortunately, though, he did very very inappropriate things with me when I was 10/12 and he was 16/18. For a few years after it stopped, I distanced myself from him because I came to realize how wrong it was. I've spent years forgiving him within myself. When he was around 20 years old, he was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with a rare illness called Labrynthitis, which caused him to become deaf in his left ear, and gave him permanent tenitis.

He says he doesnt remember much from before Labrynthitis, so whether or not he remembers what he did, I'm unsure about, but I think he does and pretends he doesn't. He's certainly changed a lot since then, and I've gotten a half hearted, vague apology from him in the past. ""Sorry if I did anything to you when we were younger"". I've found some semblance of forgiveness in my heart for it, and we are good friends again, and have been for years. But, I'll be honest, the anger and disgust still lingers. All his girlfriends since he recovered from his illness have been around my age, and though theyre adults, it still grosses me out. I actually went to school with 2 of them.

Now to throw in my friend. She is a wonderful person, and he's expressed interest to me in the past while they were both in relationships. He said if both their relationships don't work, send her his way. At the time in my head I'm like ""yeah not gonna happen"".

Fast forward to now. My brother and his gf broke up not even 3 weeks ago. My friend and her bf broke up literally 8 days ago. Neither of them have been single for more than 6 months for about 6 years, and that's not an exaggeration. F is a very nieve girl who genuinely needs to find herself, and they both keep jumping into one relationship to the next. My trauma aside, I still generally believe they shouldn't even be entertaining the idea of another relationship for themselves until they've spent more time by themselves.

That being said, F had shown a picture of my brothers to her mom, and her mom said ""omg you should just date him!"" Pointing to B, and she's been so excited about the idea since. She loves the idea of us being sisters, and her mom loves the idea of me being like a daughter, which is very sweet. They added each other on snapchat and have been texting nonstop for a little over a week now.

Without all this context, I honestly think they'd make a good match. They've both had some pretty bad goes at relationships, and I think they would be generally compatible, but I just can't get over my disgust. It just grosses me out. Something deep down inside of me is saying for christ's sake, bro. Stay the fuck away from my friends!!!!

I've had to live with this secret all my life as to not tear my family apart and ruin his life, and he's had no consequences. I believe in change, and I do believe he's a better person now, but I've had to struggle with what happened basically all alone - which reminds me - I actually did tell F about this when we were drinking, but months later when I asked if she remembered, she fuckin didn't. She was too intoxicated to remember, and I didn't want to tell her again, because her bf at the time, who is friends with my brother was there. There is a level of pain that came with that. She's one of my best friends in the world, and now I feel like I can't talk to her about this, meanwhile she talks about her trauma to me all the time, and it just reminds me of what happened to me. If this goes any further, I'll never be able to express myself, or relate to her in the same way. I will, once again, have to repress my experiences so other people can be comfortable.

I love about them both and I want them to be happy, but it'll be at my expense forever. Am I being selfish? Should I tell her what happened, or keep it to myself? They've only been talking for like 9 days, do I just nip this in the bud? It'll be a very difficult conversation. She seems to like him a lot and vice versa. I feel so evil for wanting to stop this but I will resent them both if I don't. I just really need some advice right now haha. Thank you in advance <3"

This is my PoB:  
[https://maxroll.gg/poe2/pob/h5qzw054](https://maxroll.gg/poe2/pob/h5qzw054)

I'm super confused about PoB configuration.

**In short**: This is not my main character. I just want to play around in PoB.

For now, I'm focusing only on Lightning Arrow and don't care about the rest. My main goal is to properly configure PoB for DPS, as I suspect it's not accurate right now.

**Problem**: Currently, 90% of the rare items in my build come from the ""Trade for these items"" button. I've purchased a lot of them (for testing, max 1 Divine each). However, I'm having problems with DPS numbers—they seem off. I assume I haven't configured things correctly.

I'll list my questions below:

1. For Lightning Arrow, should I set it to ""Projectile"" or ""Beam""?
2. How many counts of Lightning Arrow should I set? Should I leave it at 1 or match the number of arrows it shoots?
   * If I increase the arrow count, my DPS skyrockets. For example, I bought a **Dualstring Bow** with +2 arrows and set the arrow count to 5. The DPS became super high in PoB, but this doesn't reflect actual gameplay. When I stand far away from monsters, the arrows spread too much.
3. For **Enemy Stats**, should I leave it at ""No Boss"" and leave the enemy level blank, or should I configure it as ""Pinnacle Boss""?
4. Since the build relies on **Freeze** and **Shock**, where can I configure these effects in PoB? I can't find a setting for freeze or shock chance or their effectiveness.
   * When I use the ""Trade for these items"" button for bows or quivers, many of the items focus on added Fire or Physical damage instead of Cold or Lightning, which the build relies on.

My game knowledge is limited, so there might be other aspects I'm overlooking. Please clarify anything I'm missing."

BF freaks out anytime the idea of me partying is mentioned!,Advice,1i9mtjh,2025-01-25 08:21:45,0,0.46,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9mtjh/bf_freaks_out_anytime_the_idea_of_me_partying_is/,papalapris,,"My (F22) amazing bf (M20) has only ever had bad experiences with clubs and partners at clubs and it makes him really nervous anytime the idea of me going to a club is mentioned.

I want to approach this situation with as much empathy and understanding as possible, but part of me is like omfg I just want to dance with my girlfriend's, I'm not your ex, I can take care of myself,get over it. The other part of me understands his experiences have been traumatic and I want to be sensitive to that!

Essentially I need advice on how best to approach the conversation/how to handle it.

I'm not a big drinker at all, both my parents were alcoholics so I very rarely drink. Sometimes I go out and don't drink at all, other times...I just want to get shit faced with my best friend and have serious girl time.

I think there's a misconception of people only going to clubs for random hookups but all the girls I know are going for the other girls! I think it's a guy thing! Unsure...

I haven't actually been out by myself since being with him. I haven't been out with him either actually. I just havent been out. It's not something I'm into religiously so I've been skipping any urges to go out since it makes him so uncomfortable, but at some point I'm going to want to go out with my friends - and I don't want to feel like a criminal for doing so. Yes I've asked him to come along but he doesn't like clubs so it's hard to get him to come out. He goes to my favourite dive bar with me occasionally but we barely stay an hour.

Anytime the topic is brought up he goes into a panic and needs time to process and calm down. The most recent example was me excited to share my best friend is meeting me in Europe for a few days on our trip!! (I have a few days gap while he's with family there. I'm not going because it's on a horse ranch and I'm allergic to horses.)

He was excited for me, then his first question was asking if we're going clubbing. My best friend lovesss going out and usually drinks but she's not by any means a bad influence or promiscuous in any way... although tbh I hope she gets some...it's been a while...anyway...

I said like yeah probably once or twice but I'm definitely not the type to get blind in another country. Especially some of the counties in Europe where drugs are more common. Not my cup of tea.

He immediately went into a panic and stepped away from the convo saying he needed some time to process, and we'll talk about it in person. Totally fair! At the same time...I'm worried that even if I do go out I'm going to be the girl that's messaging and sending photos to her boyfriend the whole time.

Our relationship is absolutely beautiful, he's my soulmate and I don't think he has any insecurity about our actual relationship or that I'd cheat, I think it's just past experience that's causing a bit of a fight or flight reaction.

He's never said anything that would be guilt tripping like ""Go if you want, you obviously don't care about me"" type stuff, so I think hes aware that it's a him problem and not something that I'm doing wrong. With my (abusive) relationship history I tend to assume I'm the one in the wrong and I feel really guilty - but I know logically it is a normal thing to go clubbing with friends in your 20s! Although I'm super open to other perspectives if I might need a reality check?

What are your thoughts? How should I go about chatting to him about it?

I basically want to say ""I understand this is a worrying topic for you, but it's also something that is totally normal and shouldn't be an issue.""

He also has some autistic traits and I think spontaneity is difficult for him. If I said ""hey so and so has invited me out last minute. I'm leaving in 30."" he'd probably like actually pass out.

He also has this overwhelming need to protect me and is nervous if he can't be somewhere to protect me...as if I haven't been taking care of myself my entire life. Also a factor.

Keep in mind this man was walking the streets of london blind drunk and like 7am on his last trip so...there's that too.

TL;DR: My boyfriend hates the idea of clubbing because of trauma. I want to go out with my girlfriends a normal amount. How should I work through this with him?

Edit: I want to assure you my bf is not insecure, he's traumatised from being jumped and cheated on at clubs. The advice I'm looking for is how to approach a conversation about dealing with this trauma/his relationship to clubs and it's impact the things I get up with my friends."

Heterotopic Ossification VA Claim,VeteransBenefits,1i9miaz,2025-01-25 08:04:00,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/1i9miaz/heterotopic_ossification_va_claim/,Emotional-Buyer-5903,VA Disability Claims :claim:,"Does anyone have any experience with the VA for a Heterotopic ossification claim? 

While in C school in 04 I had an allergic reaction to something (Never happened before or again). Went to the base doc and showed him the swelling on my body including the ball of my left foot. He gave me some Benadryl, told me I was having an allergic reaction to myself (no lie) and set me on my way. All the reaction went away except for the swelling on my left foot. Went back because the Benadryl was making me fall asleep at the school house and he switched to to Claritin. I took Claritin for thirteen years thinking it was helping. I bought insoles for my boots and shoes to help with the pain. I know now that was stupid and I should have paid closer attention to it and went back to medical for it but I didn't. So please don't give me all your what ""I should have did"", while warranted, and I assure I'm aware, not helpful.

Fast forward to 17 (4 years after I got out) and finally the pain is too much. Went to a foot specialist he says its a plantar fibroma. Cuts it out and it heals with minor nerve pain and scaring. Well its back and as angry as ever. Fast forward through two foot docs and a cancer specialist (they thought it was a super rare form of cancer for a few months). Doc says it is a Heterotopic ossification. Basically a bone growing in a place it isn't supposed too and doc says most likely had a hairline fracture in my foot (most likely in boot camp)causing my stem cells to leak out and grow a bone. 

The First surgery sucked and left me with nerve pain and scar tissue. I'm sure a second one is going to make it even worse. I want to add it to the VA but I have been fighting with them for years on other shit and sure this will be much of the same. Lowkey I don't even know if I want to mess with it. Only thing in the med record is the trip to medical for the allergic reaction. 

Any insights/ideas/helpful information of the best way to go about it, I would be grateful for. Thanks "

first of all, Hyderabad Karnataka, antha Karibedi. We hate to associate with that word it is good to recognise us as Kalyana Karnataka.

yes all those points accept 5th one are true Barri paan navu matra tintidre bere kadde iroo pan masala angandi band agbek ittu

The situation of KK is mostly because of the nizam's exploitation during british rule, it wouldn't be the situation if we were under british or mysore region

Hopeless politicians who just use people for vote bank and some community people who just vote for them

Try walking into the cities of bidar, kalaburgi,raichur and Yadgir. You will notice mini-pakistan kinds of areas around all prominent cities. People just don't ask questions to politicians like those from bengaluru,mysore and hubli, even if anyone dares to do so, you will be silently finished or ignored. so, instead of that, people in these regions use their caste to please these casteist-minded politicians when they get elected. these politicians only visit the constituencies during K-K Liberation day, Independence Day, etc

current situation: half of the population of all the rural areas are working in bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad as construction workers , just see the crowd when any train from Gulbarga comes to Bengaluru. the rest half are involved in farming with no hope for the future, those who don't own the farms move to towns to work as daily labourers in market places. The only aim of these people is to get good education for their children and settle them in bengaluru!

The politicians are just opening hospitals after hospitals but not doing anything to solve the migration issues of the region. Adu yeno KKRDB antha madudru Adre, 80% of the positions are still vacant, and those who have jobs are just looting money from that board in the name of development.

monne yesto jana pregnant women sattru wrong medicine supply inda yardadru respond madudra, be it politicians or media, all were busy with DBOSS and BIGG BOSS

Just yesterday their was a protest in kalaburgi for a separate railway division because it was joined with the Solapur division. Just look at the revenue that comes from kalaburgi, Yadgir, and Raichur areas, it is more than Solapur, but still we are forced to be in that division.kalaburgi railway station earns more income than than hubli railway station but still were not getting included in SWR.

Even after so many years of hand -party rule, nothing good has happened in the region. People tried voting for the flower party, and after that, we just saw those mla's and mp's building their super deluxe, multi storied houses for them and their closer families. These mla's and mp's have local rowdies support who are associated with different castes they set up their businesses across the cities and help politicians during elections, and in return, politicians help them in return. People just want one half bottle of beer and a 500 rupee note to vote for the particular party. Yav party jasthi rokka kodutho avrige vote!

Those have already left the region and found the job elsewhere will rarely visit whenever yella - amavasi or some laxmi pooja comes avrdu voting ille idru use ila antha yarru bandu vote hakkala deserving people elections gellala and power alli iroru avr community janake ond 5% help madhanga madi mast asthi madkotarre ,aste!There is huge demograhic change that is happening the cities of these regions in the last 3-4 years recently u people might have heard some gang operating from bidar doing murders and smuggling etc because nobody cares about anything here and people are even afraid to go to some of the areas in the cities.

youth who stay here are mostly illiterate who just want to fight with youth of other communities and vise verse.On every festive celebration their will huge dolby speakers carried on trucks and tractors and do dances in thousands.and all these arrangements we will done by local polticians yestu jasthi rokka hakki grand agi celebrate madtarro the best the politician for the youths!

Need advise on whether these parts are worth the money,buildapc,1i9l6rj,2025-01-25 06:39:48,1,0.66,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1i9l6rj/need_advise_on_whether_these_parts_are_worth_the/,Any_Letterhead2575,Build Help,"I decided to take the plunge and build my first desktop after using laptops for nearly my entire life. Now, I rarely game (I may play something as intensive as Counter Strike or TF2 every once in a while) and this will mostly be a productivity work station. I don't want to go over $3,000 if possible.

I believe the most intensive things my computer will be doing include converting audio and video editing. I also like to dabble in Ethical Hacking™, so while I don't need the beefiest graphics card in the world, I would like one that won't break under pressure if I throw a bunch of password hashes at it. Ideally Nvidia, since they tend to be more compatible with password cracking software like Hashcat. I also plan on installing Arch Linux btw for those of you that don't care.

I have already purchased some parts, but I'm becoming increasingly picky about some of the components: mostly the CPU, cooling, motherboard, and graphics card.

Here are the parts I've purchased already:

* Case: [Fractal Torrent Mid Tower](https://www.newegg.com/black-fractal-design-torrent-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811352147)
* HDD: [Seagate 4TB BarraCuda SATA III](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1673383-REG/seagate_st4000dm004_barracuda_4tb_3_5_5400.html)
* SSD: [SAMSUNG 990 PRO 2TB SSD](https://www.newegg.com/samsung-2tb-990-pro-nvme-2-0/p/N82E16820147861)
* Memory: [G.SKILL Flare X Series 64GB (2 x 32GB)](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-64gb-ddr5-6000/p/N82E16820374518)

Here are the other parts I'm looking at:

* CPU: [AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-Core](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)
* Cooler: [Noctua NH-D15](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y87YHRH?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1)
* Motherboard: [MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHCCNSRH?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1)
* Graphics: [MSI Gaming RTX 4070 Super 12G Ventus 3X OC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSHFM3D5?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)
* Power supply: [SeaSonic FOCUS GX ATX 3](https://www.newegg.com/seasonic-focus-gx-atx-3-gx-1000-1000-w-80-plus-gold-certified/p/N82E16817151270)

I ran these parts through pcpartpicker and there doesn't appear to be any comparibility issues. However, since this is my first time doing this, I would appreciate some input to see if I'm being smart about the parts I'm picking. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
How's the stats?,SquadBusters,1i9kymi,2025-01-25 06:23:46,11,0.7,11,https://i.redd.it/yofofug6k4fe1.png,Relative_Economy3766,Strategy ,Tell me guys 🙃
