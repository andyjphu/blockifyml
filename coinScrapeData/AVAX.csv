That's my tryout to create a better view of Avalanche's american roots, with the flag at the back and Donald Trump, which is the main focus on US right now (even with his own token), also used AVAX + US colors to do those letterings and used AVAX's symbol to give a better branding (and it contrasts really good with the flag), hope you guys liked it, drop feedback frens :D"

I’ve had some luck with meme coins and decided to slowly start testing the waters with more stable coins. Essentially the plan is to put $10k more into my account this week. I’m not looking to withdraw anything anytime soon and am fine with being patient.

With that, if I distributed $10k more into these coins I currently have, what would you rate my current line up 1-10? Also, if you had to reco one to kill and another new coin, what would it be?

Note I put $10k into bitcoin, eth and litecoin through fidelity this week as well. Hoping I didn’t get in too late and beat any rush to crypto Trump might unlock in the coming years.

Goal: Hoping to beat the SP500 YoY gains.

What's your view on this take?,Avax,1i3qayg,2025-01-17 15:46:18,10,0.92,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/1i3qayg/whats_your_view_on_this_take/,Phrontifugist,Discussion,"My AI generated summary follows about an article on SeekingAlpha. The overall point being that explosive growth on Avalanche subnets won't translate to token value, which resides on the L1. I'm curious if you concur or disagree with his point, and offer a why/why not response. \[Note: I own a substantial amount of AVAX myself.\]

The author evaluates the current state of the Avalanche (AVAX-USD) blockchain ecosystem, focusing on its network usage, token demand, and staking performance. Key points include:

1. **Network Usage**: Avalanche transactions have increased significantly in Q4 2024 compared to the previous year, with projected 25% growth. However, most growth occurs outside the primary C-Chain, which undermines demand for the AVAX token since subnets don't require it for gas fees.
2. **AVAX Token Demand**: While gas usage has grown, active addresses have not increased proportionally. Over 90% of blockchain fees come from the C-Chain, raising concerns about the token's relevance if ecosystem growth continues to occur off the C-Chain.
3. **Staking**: AVAX offers a competitive staking reward rate of 7.8%, but the real rate after inflation adjustments (3.2%) lags behind competitors like Polkadot and Cosmos. Staked AVAX and C-Chain validators have both declined in 2024.
4. **Stablecoin and TVL Growth**: Stablecoin supply on Avalanche has grown 75% year-to-date but remains small compared to other blockchains. Total Value Locked (TVL) is modest at $1.6 billion, ranking Avalanche ninth in the sector.
5. **Concerns and Competition**: The reliance on C-Chain for AVAX utility limits the token's growth potential, especially as subnet adoption increases. Competing EVM-compatible blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum are capturing more migration from Ethereum's high-fee environment.

**Conclusion**: The author appreciates Avalanche as a user but remains cautious as an investor, citing structural challenges with AVAX token demand and competition from other ecosystems. The token is rated as a ""hold"" rather than a ""buy"" due to these issues."

Examples of AI agent use cases:   
Financial management: Monitor portfolios, execute trades, or stake tokens.  
Gaming: Act as virtual companions that evolve with you, offering strategies or in-game support.  
DAO governance: Help make decisions autonomously and transparently.

From significant price movements to regulatory developments and institutional shifts, here’s everything you need to know about today’s highlights.

**Bitcoin Breaks Through $96,000**

Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $96,000 today, marking a 4.36% increase over the last 24 hours. Analysts attribute this rise to renewed institutional interest and macroeconomic trends favoring digital assets as a hedge against inflation. Many are watching closely as BTC inches closer to the $100,000 psychological barrier.

**Ethereum Whale Resurfaces**

A prominent Ethereum (ETH) whale, dormant for over two years, transferred 10,000 ETH to Kraken earlier today. This move has sparked speculation within the crypto community, with some suggesting an upcoming sale and others theorizing it as a strategic reallocation. Ethereum's price, currently hovering around $5,200, has remained relatively stable despite this news.

**Kazakhstan Tightens Crypto Regulations**

Kazakhstan’s government announced stricter measures for non-resident crypto operations. Non-residents will soon face a one-year validity limit on local financial accounts, a move aimed at curbing unregulated activities. This policy could significantly impact crypto miners and traders operating in the region, given Kazakhstan’s role as a major crypto mining hub.

**Market Analysis: Bullish Yet Cautious**

Market analysts are projecting a mixed outlook for the coming months. While short-term corrections may drive Bitcoin down to $50,000, a bullish long-term view persists, with price targets reaching as high as $250,000 by the end of 2025. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) are also seeing increased attention due to their growing ecosystems.

**NFT Market Update**

While the NFT craze has cooled compared to its 2021 highs, activity remains steady in niche sectors. High-profile artists and gaming platforms continue to launch innovative projects, keeping the market alive. However, overall volumes have dipped, and many wonder if a second wave of adoption is on the horizon.

**TradingView: An Essential Tool for Crypto Traders**

For traders navigating today’s volatile market, TradingView remains an indispensable platform. Known for its real-time charts, extensive library of technical indicators, and user-friendly interface, TradingView enables crypto enthusiasts to make informed decisions. Its community feature allows traders to share ideas, fostering a collaborative environment in the trading world. [TradingView Premium for Free](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/)

**What Lies Ahead?**

The coming days promise to be pivotal as traders await further clarity on regulatory measures, macroeconomic shifts, and potential announcements from crypto giants. Staying informed and agile is the key to capitalizing on opportunities in this ever-evolving space.

Keep an eye on these developments, and as always, ensure your strategies are backed by thorough research and risk management practices."

In a dramatic turn of events, the crypto market is witnessing a significant selloff, with traders hastily dumping their holdings in Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe, and Bonk. This sudden move has left many in the crypto community reeling, as these memecoins, once the darlings of speculative investors, are now facing a brutal reality check.

The broader crypto market, including major players like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is also feeling the heat. Bitcoin, which had been hovering around the $104,000 mark, has shown signs of weakness, while Ethereum continues to grapple with high network traffic and skyrocketing transaction fees.

Solana (SOL), another significant player, is seeing some volatility, but analysts remain optimistic about its potential, especially with projects like Aptos and LSD showing promising signs. The Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain is also gaining attention for its high transaction throughput and decentralized nature, making it a viable alternative to Ethereum[2].

As the market navigates this turbulent period, investors are advised to be cautious and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. The allure of quick gains in lesser-known coins is tempting, but it's crucial to identify undervalued gems rather than chasing already-popular coins that may have limited upside left[1].

Which Crypto Has Defi?,CoinsForge,1hyes1v,2025-01-10 15:57:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinsForge/comments/1hyes1v/which_crypto_has_defi/,Dunnoman7,,"# The rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is transforming the cryptocurrency landscape, creating a financial system free from intermediaries. Built on blockchain technology, DeFi relies on decentralized applications (DApps) to provide financial services. But which cryptocurrencies are at the forefront of this revolution? Let’s uncover the top players in DeFi.

# Leading Cryptocurrencies in the DeFi World

# Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the trailblazer of DeFi, hosting the majority of decentralized finance projects. With its robust smart contract functionality, Ethereum enables developers to build innovative DApps. Popular DeFi platforms such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound thrive on Ethereum, establishing it as the backbone of DeFi. Additionally, Ethereum’s extensive developer community ensures continuous innovation, keeping the ecosystem dynamic and competitive.

# Binance Smart Chain (BNB) Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a strong competitor, offering low transaction fees and fast processing speeds. Its affordability has attracted projects like PancakeSwap and Venus, making it a popular choice among DeFi users. BSC’s compatibility with Ethereum’s ecosystem, through its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allows developers to migrate projects seamlessly, contributing to its rapid adoption.

# Solana (SOL) Solana stands out for its exceptional speed and minimal transaction costs. The platform’s scalability has made it a favorite for developers, with platforms like Serum and Raydium gaining traction. Solana’s high throughput, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, positions it as a top choice for DeFi applications that require efficiency.

# Polygon (MATIC) Acting as a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Polygon enhances scalability and reduces costs. It supports DeFi platforms like QuickSwap and the Polygon version of Aave, offering a seamless user experience. Polygon’s interoperability with other blockchains and its focus on user-friendly development tools make it a critical part of the DeFi ecosystem.

# Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is designed for high performance, boasting fast transaction speeds and scalability. Projects like Pangolin and Trader Joe have become integral parts of its DeFi ecosystem. Avalanche’s unique architecture, which includes three interoperable blockchains, ensures flexibility and efficiency for developers.

For the EIGHTH STRAIGHT YEAR: Announcing The Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment for 2025!,CryptoCurrency,1hvu3fn,2025-01-07 10:37:33,32,0.83,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hvu3fn/for_the_eighth_straight_year_announcing_the_top/,Joe-M-4,ANALYSIS,"https://preview.redd.it/ste610s7clbe1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1ee5bed78d2b78254f99cd2962945d2473e2976

# The 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment Has Begun!

For the [**eighth year in a row**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/), I am happy to announce the launch of the Top Ten Cryptocurrency Index Fund Experiment for 2025.  

For those unfamiliar with the Experiments, my annual tradition is to buy $100 of each of the Top Ten Cryptos every New Year’s Day since [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

***The Top Ten Experiments have now purchased a total of $8,000 in crypto since January 2018.***

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio includes the following cryptos, in descending order as per [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/) on January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/zex7wo5cclbe1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4818de85bafc0aff776f36ff8f3df0ee075989de

**That’s a $1000 investment on the 1st of January, 2025**, ($100 each) of #1 **BTC**, #2 **ETH**, #3 **XRP**, #5 **BNB**, #6 **SOL**, #7 **DOGE**, #8 **USDC**, #9 **ADA**, #10 **TRON**, and #11 **AVAX**.

Fun fact #1: *For the second year in a row, all 2025 coins have appeared in at least one past Top Ten Portfolio, meaning no new cryptocurrencies have joined the overall Experiment.* 

Long time Top Ten Experiment followers will notice **I’m again breaking the tradition of strictly investing in the Top Ten by market cap, no matter what.**  To stay consistent with past Experiments, I will only include one stablecoin, so #11 **AVAX** is in and #7 **USDT** is out.  I made a similar decision with the [**2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/), [**2023**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023/), and [**2024 Top Ten Portfolios**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/).  

**USDC** will remain in the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio. 

So: ***The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio = Top Ten – USDT + #11 AVAX.***

Q: *Why keep a stablecoin in the portfolio at all?* 

A: Consistency.  For better or worse, I included **USDT** in the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and one stable in every subsequent year since.  Including a stablecoin in the 2025 Top Ten is my attempt at an honest/fair comparison between each year’s portfolios.

Q: *Why were stablecoins included in the Top Ten Experiments in the first place?*  

A:  Check out the [FAQs](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/).

# Where Did You Purchase The 2025 Top Ten Crypto?

Thanks to the good work they’re doing over at [Universal](https://app.universalassets.xyz/), I barely had to leave Base this year. Details/proof of purchases below:

I used [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/) on Base for **WBTC (ahem, cbBTC)** and **WETH:**

Fun fact #2: *For the first time in Experiment history, I purchased 100% of the Top Ten on Decentralized Exchanges*

# My Homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Fund VS Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an *attempt to capture the gains of the entire cryptocurrency market.*  

No crypto indexes existed, so I created my own.

Crypto has rapidly progressed in recent years and now more and more options exist.

This year I’ll be comparing my homemade Top Ten Index to [Coinbase’s COIN50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), Coinbase’s benchmark crypto index, which offers “diversified exposure to 50 leading digital assets.”  Here’s the snapshot of what COIN50 was worth on 1 January 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/lpxn0y2wclbe1.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=264120ef3c9e74a0ae217fc463236474e9e6e690

**Here’s the question I’ll be tracking:** as the year goes by, ***will COIN50 outperform my homemade Top Ten Index Fund?*** 

# All Systems Go!

Like every year, I’m excited to launch the latest iteration of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. If you’re new to the Experiments, welcome! If you’ve been following over the years, many thanks for sticking around. 

The first monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio will drop in early February.  Other reports from the 2018-2024 Top Ten Portfolios will be released periodically over the course of the year.

In the meantime, you’re welcome to pour through years of data [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

Happy New Year and here’s hoping for an up only 2025 (insert rocket emoji here).

Staking Explained in Simple Terms: What It Is and How Beginners Can Earn,u_Ok_Note8852,1hvp53e,2025-01-07 06:11:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Note8852/comments/1hvp53e/staking_explained_in_simple_terms_what_it_is_and/,Ok_Note8852,,"In traditional finance, a popular way to earn passive income is by keeping money in bank deposits or low-risk investments in bonds. This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking — a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

https://preview.redd.it/1xu7ktmi1kbe1.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b6f20bc05e4cdde2acbd5082eee55f8b245028

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

The key metric when choosing a network and platform for staking is APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which reflects the annual return considering reward reinvestment. It’s important to balance rewards, network reliability, and asset volatility.

Here is a list of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies for staking as of this article’s writing, according to Staking Rewards.

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** The largest PoS blockchain with $132.4 billion locked in staking. The network offers an APY of 3.48%.
2. **Solana (SOL):** Known for high transaction speeds and low fees. $91.2 billion locked, with an APY of 6.65%.
3. **Sui (SUI):** A next-gen blockchain quickly gaining popularity. $33 billion locked, with an APY of 2.81%.
4. **Cardano (ADA):** One of the earliest and most stable PoS networks. $26 billion locked, with an APY of 2.67%.
5. **Binance Coin (BNB):** Native token of Binance Smart Chain. $21.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.22%.
6. **Tron (TRX):** One of the oldest blockchains with staking. $13 billion locked, with an APY of 4.65%.
7. **Aptos (APT):** A rapidly developing network competing with Sui. $12.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.00%.
8. **Avalanche (AVAX):** A popular ecosystem with high transaction speeds. $12.41 billion locked, with an APY of 7.79%.
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** A blockchain with unique architecture supporting parachains. $8.65 billion locked, with an APY of 11.96%.
10. **Celestia (TIA):** A modular blockchain launched in 2023. $6.12 billion locked, with an APY of 10.69%.

These projects offer unique opportunities for users wishing to earn through staking due to varying reward parameters and use cases.

# Best Staking Platforms

The choice of a provider depends on the supported assets, reliability, and user preferences.

Below is a list of the largest staking providers with a brief description and statistics on the amount of locked capital (TVL) and the number of stakers. Data is from StakingReward and is accurate as of the article’s writing.

1. **Ether.fi:** A decentralized platform for Ethereum staking. TVL: $22.7 billion, stakers: 260K.
2. **Kiln:** A corporate-level platform for Ethereum and other PoS assets. TVL: $10.7 billion, stakers: 97K.
3. **P2P.org:** A professional staking provider supporting networks like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. TVL: $10 billion, stakers: 90K.

These platforms offer a wide range of staking solutions, catering to both institutional and retail users. The supported networks allow every investor to find their balance between returns and risk.

# Conclusion

Staking is a way to earn passive income and actively participate in supporting blockchain operations. Its popularity is explained by energy efficiency compared to mining, ease of participation, and the potential for stable rewards.

However, participating in the network’s infrastructure requires understanding technical processes and associated risks. For beginners, staking can offer an easy and accessible way to earn, provided they use providers that lower the entry barrier and technical complexities. It's crucial to carefully choose platforms and projects to minimize potential threats.

With innovations like liquid staking and restaking, users have even more tools to manage their assets flexibly. These solutions make the process more convenient and appealing for both experienced investors and newcomers eager to integrate into the crypto ecosystem."

Check out the cryptocurrencies that appreciated the most in 2024 and left Bitcoin behind,CapitalistExploits,1hsmhwe,2025-01-03 08:30:26,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hsmhwe/check_out_the_cryptocurrencies_that_appreciated/,kayakero,,"The cryptocurrency market in 2024 was marked by major swings, with alternative assets (altcoins) outperforming Bitcoin in terms of appreciation throughout the year. Despite this, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is still delivering a 117% appreciation in 2024.

While Bitcoin posted solid gains driven by factors such as the approval of spot ETFs and growing institutional adoption, other tokens achieved even more remarkable returns.

Narratives such as memecoins, exchange tokens, layer 1s, and DePIN assets were some of the projects that achieved percentage increases that far outpaced BTC's performance. Below is a list of the five cryptocurrencies that appreciated the most so far this year (YTD):

* **Baby (BABY)** : 1.318%
* **dogwifhat (WIF)**: 1.047%
* **Bitget Token (BGB)**: 895%
* **On (SUI)** : 404%
* **AIOZ Network (AIOZ)** : 385%

https://preview.redd.it/kgdzzx9rcfae1.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69ee1c05789ca341bec6ae4461b45bb2e1338a6

Four of these five cryptocurrencies also renewed their all-time highs in 2024. PEPE hit $0.00002803 on Dec. 9, WIF recorded $4.83 on Mar. 31, BGB hit $8.45 on Dec. 27, and SUI marked its all-time high price of $4.91 on Dec. 16.

# Cryptocurrencies that appreciated the most in 2024

It is important to note that none of these cryptocurrencies are part of the Top 10 (the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization). The largest of them, in terms of market value, is PEPE, which occupies only the 25th position in the CoinGecko ranking.

If we consider the top 10 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins like USDT and USDC and the synthetic ETH), the one that delivered the largest annual appreciation (so far) is also a memecoin: **Dogecoin (DOGE)** with an annual increase of 250%. In second place is **XRP** with an increase of 233%. The following cryptocurrencies are:

* **Toncoin (TON)** : 145%
* **TRON (TRX)**: 138%
* **BNB (BNB)** : 125%
* **Bitcoin (BTC)**: 117%
* **Solana (SOL)** : 79.4%
* **Ethereum (ETH)**: 45,7%
* **Cardano (ADA)** : 39%

The only crypto asset in the Top 10 to record losses in 2024 (-12%) was **Avalanche (AVAX)**, according to data from the [Blockchain Center](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/) platform.

https://preview.redd.it/hsxp5paxcfae1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d50e0166167c3fda08b07801cfa75e75022e50f

Bitcoin also hit its 2024 all-time high, reaching $108,135 on Dec. 17. Similarly, BNB hit its ATH of $788 on Dec. 4, SOL hit $263 on Nov. 23, TRON hit $0.43 on Dec. 4, and Toncoin hit its all-time high of $8.25 on Jun. 15.

This subreddit and the discord seem  to have slowly dwindling amounts of interaction. What use to be technical analysis or news related posts have become a random question or posts about small projects launching and the posts receive very little attention.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad we’re not getting spam posts about price action and what not like other pages but the lack of interaction in general is beginning to be concerning. 

There have been some exciting projects and the launch of Avalanche 9000 and there wasn’t a huge uplift in community engagement. There is lots of buzz in the world of crypto right now and yet I rarely see Avax mentioned. This subreddits member count is above 55k yet we have some days without a single post. I don’t mean to bash on the community or compare us to other subreddits but I’m just wondering if there is any cause for concern in the long term or if I’m just overly concerned. "

I also hear good things about Polkadot, SUI, TRAC and Internet Computer ICP.

My original plan was to diversify so I didn't miss out if any one of them started to ""win"".

But obviously, my investment is being split so there's less in each one than if i just picked one.

Which Cryptocurrencies Could Rise After the New Year: Predictions and Trends,TradingElite,1ho0k00,2024-12-28 02:19:40,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1ho0k00/which_cryptocurrencies_could_rise_after_the_new/,Maylights,,"The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and highly volatile, where price fluctuations can be sudden and sharp. However, several factors can help traders and investors make informed predictions about which cryptocurrencies might experience growth in the coming year. These factors include analyzing trends, news, technological updates, and market sentiment following the New Year celebrations.

In this article, we will explore cryptocurrencies that may rise after the New Year based on current trends, key events, and promising projects.

**1. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Leader with Growth Potential**

Bitcoin (BTC) has always been the leader of the cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin rises, many altcoins tend to follow suit with positive price movements. Despite experiencing some corrections throughout 2023, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto space, and its long-term outlook continues to be positive for several reasons.

Why Bitcoin Could Rise:

\- Institutional Interest: Bitcoin has been increasingly adopted by institutional investors as a store of value, similar to digital gold. With rising inflation concerns and uncertainty in traditional markets, Bitcoin could attract more capital from both institutional and retail investors in the upcoming year.

\- Halving Event (2024): The next Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, is a key event that has historically led to significant price increases. Halving reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin, which tightens supply, often leading to upward price pressure.

\- Regulatory Clarity: As governments around the world continue to refine their regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies, clearer regulations could provide Bitcoin with more legitimacy and confidence from investors.

**2. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract Giant**

Ethereum (ETH) has long been the dominant blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the successful transition to Ethereum 2.0, which introduced the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ethereum is well-positioned for future growth.

Why Ethereum Could Rise:

\- Ethereum 2.0 and Scalability: Ethereum’s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 has significantly improved its scalability, transaction speed, and energy efficiency. This makes Ethereum more appealing for developers and businesses building on its platform.

\- DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As both sectors continue to evolve, Ethereum is likely to see increased adoption.

\- Layer 2 Solutions: With the growing popularity of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, Ethereum is expected to handle more transactions with lower fees, further driving its utility and use case in 2024.

**3. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Blockchain with a Strong Ecosystem**

Solana (SOL) is often regarded as a ""Bitcoin alternative"" due to its high transaction speeds and low costs. Although the network faced challenges in 2022, it has shown resilience and continues to be one of the most promising platforms for decentralized applications.

Why Solana Could Rise:

\- Faster Transactions and Lower Fees: Solana’s blockchain offers incredibly fast transaction speeds and low fees compared to Ethereum. This makes it an attractive option for developers and users, particularly in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs.

\- Continued Ecosystem Growth: Solana has seen significant growth in its developer ecosystem, with various projects building on the platform. If this trend continues, Solana could benefit from increased demand for its network.

\- Strong Partnerships and Adoption: Solana has secured partnerships with major players in the crypto space, including institutions and blockchain projects, which could increase its adoption in 2024.

**4. Cardano (ADA): A Contender in the Smart Contract Space**

Cardano (ADA) is often viewed as a competitor to Ethereum due to its focus on building a scalable, secure, and sustainable blockchain. While Cardano’s development has been slower than Ethereum’s, it has made significant strides in 2023, particularly with the launch of smart contracts.

Why Cardano Could Rise:

\- Ongoing Development and Partnerships: Cardano’s team, led by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, continues to make progress on key updates and improvements to the platform. The network has established partnerships with governments and organizations, which may boost adoption in 2024.

\- Focus on Sustainability: Cardano’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake model has become a selling point as environmental concerns around proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin grow.

\- Growing Ecosystem: With the introduction of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), Cardano has the potential to attract more developers and users in the coming year.

**5. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Interoperability**

Polkadot (DOT) aims to solve one of the biggest challenges in the blockchain space: interoperability. Its unique architecture allows different blockchains to communicate with each other, which is crucial for the growth of decentralized finance and the broader crypto ecosystem.

Why Polkadot Could Rise:

\- Interoperability and Parachains: Polkadot’s parachain model allows multiple blockchains to operate alongside each other, making it easier for developers to create customized blockchains for specific applications. This could position Polkadot as a major player in the multichain ecosystem.

\- Strong Ecosystem and Development Activity: Polkadot has attracted numerous projects to build on its platform. As the ecosystem grows, demand for DOT may increase.

\- Potential for Enterprise Adoption: Polkadot’s focus on scalability and interoperability makes it an attractive option for enterprises looking to build their own blockchain networks.

**6. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Solution for DeFi**

Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts to interact with real-world data. It plays a crucial role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing reliable off-chain data to blockchain applications.

Why Chainlink Could Rise:

\- Increased Demand for Oracles: As the DeFi space continues to grow, the demand for reliable data feeds will increase. Chainlink’s technology is critical to the functioning of many DeFi applications, making it a key player in the space.

\- Partnerships and Integrations: Chainlink has established numerous partnerships with major blockchain projects and traditional financial institutions, which could further drive its adoption in 2024.

\- New Use Cases: Chainlink is expanding into new areas like insurance, supply chain management, and gaming, which could open up additional growth opportunities.

**7. Avalanche (AVAX): Scalable and Fast Blockchain for dApps**

Avalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that focuses on fast transaction speeds and low costs. It aims to be a competitor to Ethereum by offering a more efficient blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps).

Why Avalanche Could Rise:

\- High-Speed Transactions: Avalanche’s consensus protocol allows for thousands of transactions per second, making it a strong contender for high-traffic dApps and DeFi protocols.

\- Ecosystem Growth: Avalanche has attracted a growing number of projects in the DeFi space, which could drive demand for AVAX in the future.

\- Strong Developer Community: Avalanche’s developer community continues to grow, and the platform’s ease of use and scalability make it an attractive option for dApp developers.

**8. Chain (XCN): Potential for Long-Term Growth**

Chain (XCN) is a relatively new but promising cryptocurrency that focuses on creating decentralized financial infrastructure for businesses and institutions. As more businesses explore blockchain adoption, XCN could experience significant growth.

Why Chain Could Rise:

\- Enterprise Adoption: Chain’s focus on facilitating enterprise blockchain adoption positions it well for long-term growth as more industries begin to incorporate blockchain technology into their operations.

\- Unique Use Cases: Chain's partnerships and real-world use cases in sectors like finance and supply chain management could drive increased demand for its tokens.

**9. TradingView and Crypto Heatmaps: A Tool for Identifying Market Trends**

For traders looking to track potential price movements of these cryptocurrencies, TradingView is a valuable platform. [TradingView ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/)offers advanced charting tools, real-time market data, and crypto heatmaps to quickly assess the performance of various cryptocurrencies.

By incorporating TradingView’s tools into their trading strategies, investors can stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions about potential investments.

**Conclusion**

While predicting the future of any cryptocurrency can be challenging due to the volatility of the market, several factors suggest that the following cryptocurrencies have the potential for growth after the New Year: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chain (XCN). These coins are backed by strong technology, growing ecosystems, and increasing adoption, which position them well for continued success in 2024.

As always, it is essential for investors to conduct thorough research and consider the risks associated with cryptocurrency investing. While the future looks promising for these projects, the crypto market can be unpredictable, so a diversified portfolio and proper risk management are key to success.

"Is it true Avax is going to have to rely on improving subnet usability, better incentives to developers and faster transactions in order to dominate its niche?

It has its own goals and I love what the team is aiming for and I believe it has a genuine chance at widespread utilization and adoption moving forward, but it is quite appparent that its adoption is lower than Solana and ether as of right now due to the lack of prioritization on what avalanche aims to achieve, and that is many things, but particularly hyper custom and independent blockchains that can be developed on the main network. 

The difficulty in using subnets I have heard has led to a lack of adoption compared to Solana that, may not be as custom and independent in regard to what developers can do, but it has a friendly system that attracts a lot of developers to develop projects on its ultra fast and user friendly platform. Avalanche is not as fast or friendly, but i believe it has a stronger place in the crypto world if it can get what it needs to do right.

My thing is, is it possible for avalanche to become more streamlined in order for its ecosystem to grow? Because I think it’s hyper customization ability on block chain can benefit web 3 gaming and projects to a greater degree than many other blockchains, and its privatization in doing so I believe positions itself very well. I have been researching the project all day and love what I have been reading, but a lot of it is future goals rather than anything now, hence why it isn’t as popular as a few other big layer 1s. 

Let me know if you all think avax needs to address what I mentioned in the title in order to succeed, and let me know if there is objective truth in this project being able to stand out in what it wants to do"
