My one week review,ZBD,1i9wwcj,2025-01-25 15:59:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZBD/comments/1i9wwcj/my_one_week_review/,Commercial_Swan1747,,"Unbiased, unpaid, real human review: 4.3/5. 
 I was skeptical to download given some 1 star reviews & things said on reddit.

Positives: 
+Currently working part time from Holiday season so I had free time. Week without a referral I made $15.88 BTC cashed out >Coinbase & then Crypto.com. I targeted when BTC was at a low using Trading View candle charts. 
+Easy cash out, lots of ways to earn.
+ZBD official games are great for earning daily payouts. Specifically Bitcoin Miner, Idle Miner.
     √ó  (I tend to use idle miner the most as when I'm busy I can leave it on in my pocket to get me to the amount I need to progress)

Negatives:
 -Surveys tend to say inaccurate data even when given exact real info. -Playtime stopped paying goals after new member bonus.
-Playtime rewards stop paying out with some games (Coin Master in my case stopped recording time played and never registered my 60 minute session even after 48 hours had passed).
     -thus I recommend getting your rewards early        on ans moving on to a new game when possible to maximize your new member bonus.
-I cannot speak on all games but even though my region is a daily 350 payout, after two days of payout of 350 on idle miner, the next day it was lowered to 320. I may be lacking information as a new user but keep this in mind and do your research. Maybe someone here knows why.
-Some games like BTC cards and GPU miner are intrusive with ads to an unnecessary amount and use tactics to time the ads as you're tapping so that you accidentally open that ad. Those apps also tend to be basic in format but lack optization and can be difficult to use as it tends to be unresponsive sometimes. 

USE REFERALS. You both get 20% of what both of you gain from activities. If you can, get a referral from someone here on reddit (DO NOT POST YOUR CODES HERE IN THE OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT. READ THE RULES) and refer other people to join so you all make money. Making the referral a must for passive income. 


Overall. This is a must have application especially if you want to take advantage of the current bull market rush of 2025. 

Additionally, users who have been using this app for awhile, please share any suggestions or tactics that may help me more.
I'd also like to hear from people who invest real money to know if it's worth it.
Happy grinding everyone. Love it here. "

* [Alphabet¬†](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-hundreds-of-employees/)reported strong Q3 earnings, surpassing expectations, with a 15.1% YoY revenue increase.

Advisory Alpha LLC‚Äôs decision to increase its position in Alphabet Inc. by 6.8% during Q4 highlights growing¬†[institutional confidence¬†](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/sec-approves-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-options-will-btc-hit-100000-in-2024/)in the tech giant.

The firm now holds 22,842 shares, worth approximately $4.35 million, further indicating Alphabet‚Äôs stable financial outlook. Other hedge funds have also adjusted their stakes in the¬†[company](https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/market-update-sensex-surges-nifty-it-hits-milestone-company-earnings-show-mixed-results/), adding to its momentum as it prepares for future growth.

# Alphabet‚Äôs Institutional Backing Grows Amid Strong Financial Performance

Alphabet‚Äôs performance continues to impress, with strong earnings and[¬†consistent growth](https://worldmagzine.com/business/tcs-to-benefit-from-tapering-bsnl-deal-and-expansion-plans-in-bengaluru/). The company posted $2.12 per share for Q3 2024, surpassing analysts‚Äô consensus estimates, and its revenue was up 15.1% from the previous year. With institutional investors showing confidence and analysts maintaining a positive outlook, Alphabet‚Äôs stock continues to be viewed as a strong investment option, with a price target of $205.13.

Alphabet‚Äôs recent Q3 earnings report shows its solid performance, with an EPS of $2.12, beating estimates by $0.29. The company‚Äôs revenue for the quarter reached $88.27 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. This growth of 15.1% year-over-year underscores Alphabet‚Äôs consistent ability to deliver strong financial results.

This move further[¬†boosts investor](https://worldmagzine.com/business/tcs-to-benefit-from-tapering-bsnl-deal-and-expansion-plans-in-bengaluru/)¬†confidence, as it highlights the company‚Äôs robust cash flow and commitment to rewarding shareholders. The dividend payout ratio remains modest at 10.61%, indicating that the company retains ample resources for future investments.

Despite some insider selling, including notable transactions from CAO Amie Thuener O‚Äôtoole and Director Frances Arnold, Alphabet remains an attractive stock for institutional investors. Analysts have set a price target of $205.13, signaling continued optimism about the company‚Äôs future prospects.

Alphabet Inc. continues to show strong¬†[financial results](https://worldmagzine.com/fashion/resilience-in-fashion-q3-2024-financial-performance-highlights/)¬†and institutional backing, making it an appealing investment for the future."

Back in July I bought 2800$ in bitcoin that was being put aside for tax time. My reasoning for that was to hedge $CAD inflation and maybe make a little extra. Since then its been sitting with 100$ thrown in here and there and today I make the regrettable but responsible decision to sell at 80% profit totalling 6500$. I hate selling as I know BTC is only going up in price but I will be able to pay the remaining 3200$ I owe on a 27% APR car loan. 

No more stress about a 200$ bi weekly car payment means I can allocate the 200$ into buying more bitcoin and with time my BTC reserve will sit above 6000$+, hedge CAD$ devaluation with no pressure to sell it. Thank you for reading. Taking profit is good and all but It cannot be enjoyed if I owe that amount with a 27% interest rate. 

Bonus is my credit score will be looking snazzy!"

I found an app for Android that lets you mine real Bitcoin for free by watching ads and even one option without an ad. But the more ads you watch the more computing power you get to mine BTC faster. It doesn't make your phone slower because you are not using the actual phone to mine anything.

Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitcoin.minning.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitcoin.minning.com)

You can use my referral code if you want: KFMNOM

The minimun amount to withdraw is 0.0000002 which takes about 2 days to mine. You can download Speed wallet to your browser and use that as a wallet for example.

Tip for more Bitcoin faster: I also use my old phone that I don't need and installed virtual machine to it to run android phone on it so I have currently installed 3 apps to mine, takes a little time to click all the ads and wait for those videos to end but so far I have earned 0.00000087 in under a week.

Edit: The amount we mine doesn't have much value today but history has shown that Bitcoins value could rise so it will be worth it in the future :)"
Bitcoin/etn + microstrategy = troppa esposizione o diversificazione?,ItaliaPersonalFinance,1i9r5cb,2025-01-25 11:49:29,1,0.56,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1i9r5cb/bitcoinetn_microstrategy_troppa_esposizione_o/,micheledoors,Portafoglio e Investimenti,"ancora non ho acquistato nulla, ma volendosi esporre al mondo crypto, come da titolo, vorrei capire se detenere Bitcoin e / o avere un ETF in bitcoin , e/o aggiungere l'azione di un'azienda che dovrebbe detenere il corrispettivo investito ( se ho capito bene ) come Microstrategy rientri nella diversificazione o nell'eccesos di esposizione.

Mi spiego meglio:  
Poniamo il caso che, io credo fortemente nei btc  e cripto in genere, e al tempo stesso voglio anche speculare, la strategia migliore quale sarebbe ? investire tutto in un aspetto es: detenere bitcoin reali e vendere di tanto in tanto, nonostante la tax a 33%.  
Oppure una parte detenerla per non pagarci mai tasse a lunghissimo termine  - prima o poi magari cambia - ed una parte sfruttarla tramite etn/azioni mcrs per approfittare dell'oscillazione ?

spero di essere stato chiaro, magari non mi sono espresso molto bene. per√≤ quello che penso e ho capito da studi effettuati, che comunque avere un azion dell'azienda o l'etf non √® proprio come detenere il btc fisico, quindi √® differente a livello di ""prodotto reale"" e quindi di come dire ""credo"" nel progetto ?!"

# Kripto Para √áe≈üitleri

Kripto paralar farklƒ± ama√ßlara hizmet eden √ße≈üitli t√ºrlere ayrƒ±labilir:

# 1.¬†Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en pop√ºler kripto paradƒ±r. 2009 yƒ±lƒ±nda Satoshi Nakamoto takma adƒ±yla biri veya bir grup tarafƒ±ndan geli≈ütirilmi≈ütir. Dijital altƒ±n olarak da adlandƒ±rƒ±lan Bitcoin, bir deƒüer saklama aracƒ± ve √∂deme sistemi olarak kullanƒ±lƒ±r.

# 2.¬†Altcoin‚Äôler

Bitcoin haricindeki t√ºm kripto paralar ‚Äúaltcoin‚Äù olarak adlandƒ±rƒ±lƒ±r. Bazƒ± pop√ºler altcoin‚Äôler ≈üunlardƒ±r:

* **Ethereum (ETH):**¬†Akƒ±llƒ± s√∂zle≈ümeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) i√ßin bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):**¬†Hƒ±zlƒ± uluslararasƒ± √∂deme sistemleri i√ßin kullanƒ±lƒ±r.
* **Litecoin (LTC):**¬†Bitcoin‚Äôin daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hƒ±zlƒ± i≈ülem yapƒ±lmasƒ±nƒ± saƒülar.

# 3.¬†Stablecoin‚Äôler

Stablecoin‚Äôler, fiyat dalgalanmasƒ±nƒ± azaltmak i√ßin itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altƒ±n gibi fiziksel varlƒ±klara endekslenmi≈ütir. √ñrnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4.¬†Meme Coin‚Äôler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) √ºzerine kurulu kripto paralardƒ±r. √ñrneƒüin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5.¬†NFT‚Äôler ve Token‚Äôlar

* **NFT‚Äôler (Non-Fungible Tokens):**¬†Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlƒ±klarƒ± temsil eder.

Kripto paralarƒ± kullanmak i√ßin bir banka hesabƒ±na gerek yoktur. Bir internet baƒülantƒ±sƒ±na sahip herkes, d√ºnyanƒ±n her yerinden bu paralara eri≈üebilir.

# 4.¬†Yatƒ±rƒ±m Fƒ±rsatlarƒ±

Kripto paralar, y√ºksek getirili bir¬†[**yatƒ±rƒ±m**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/)¬†aracƒ± olarak pop√ºlerlik kazanmƒ±≈ütƒ±r. Bitcoin gibi bazƒ± kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatƒ±rƒ±mlar i√ßin tercih edilmektedir.

# 5.¬†G√ºvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin deƒüi≈ütirilemez ve g√ºvenli bir ≈üekilde saklanmasƒ±nƒ± saƒülar. Bu da kripto paralarƒ± geleneksel sistemlere g√∂re daha g√ºvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranƒ±n Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatƒ±rƒ±m yaparken dikkate alƒ±nmasƒ± gereken bazƒ± √∂nemli riskler vardƒ±r:

# 1.¬†Fiyat Dalgalanmasƒ± (Volatilite)

Kripto paralarƒ±n deƒüeri kƒ±sa s√ºre i√ßinde b√ºy√ºk √∂l√ß√ºlerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, y√ºksek k√¢r getirme potansiyeli olduƒüu kadar y√ºksek kayƒ±p riskini de beraberinde getirir.

Bitcoin Surges Above $106K as BTC Reserve Hopes Grow Under Trump,bitfate,1i9pj05,2025-01-25 10:38:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9pj05/bitcoin_surges_above_106k_as_btc_reserve_hopes/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Bitcoin Soars as Trump‚Äôs Crypto-Friendly Stance Sparks Market Frenzy

Bitcoin is flying high as momentum builds around a potential strategic national BTC reserve under President Trump. The crypto market has been abuzz with the news, driving BTC prices to new heights. As of January 25, 2025, Bitcoin is predicted to reach $111,141.21, marking a significant 6.97% increase from the previous day[1].

The recent surge in Bitcoin's value is partly attributed to the bullish market sentiment, with a Fear & Greed Index score of 84, indicating Extreme Greed. This optimism is fueled by Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly manifesto and the subsequent launch of the TRUMP and Melania meme tokens, which drew a combined peak valuation of $9.2 billion before retracing[5].

The broader cryptocurrency market has also seen a significant boost, with the market capitalization nearing its all-time high of $3.7 trillion following Trump‚Äôs inauguration. This influx of capital has particularly benefited AI and memecoins sectors, which saw substantial gains in 2024[5].

In addition to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) are also riding the wave of ecosystem growth. BNB has experienced a 9% surge, reaching $715, driven by increased trading activity and innovative initiatives within the BNB Chain ecosystem[3].

As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are keeping a close eye on emerging sectors such as AI, consumer payments, and memecoins. These areas are expected to be key drivers of growth in the cryptocurrency space in 2025[5].

# The Winklevoss Twins

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known as the Winklevoss Twins, are famous for their involvement in the early days of Facebook. The duo¬†invested in Bitcoin in 2013, purchasing around 120,000 BTC¬†when the price was around $120 per BTC.

Furthermore, their initial investment of $11 million is now worth billions of dollars, making them some of the richest Bitcoin millionaires in history.

# Erik Finman

Erik Finman was just 12 years old when he invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2011. With the guidance of his older brother, he bought Bitcoin when it was priced at around $12 per BTC.

https://preview.redd.it/367nu8qvtqee1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4d605bc877c8592fa134a5e704640091e744444

Fast forward to today,¬†Finman‚Äôs investment¬†has made him a crypto millionaire, with his Bitcoin holdings worth tens of millions of dollars.

# Tim Draper

Venture capitalist Tim Draper is one of many well-known Bitcoin investors and millionaires. In 2014, Draper participated in a US Marshals auction and purchased nearly 30,000 BTC seized from the now-defunct¬†Silk Road marketplace.

He paid an estimated $18 million for the coins, whose value has since increased exponentially.

Draper‚Äôs investment is now valued at over $1 billion, making him one of the most successful Bitcoin millionaires in the world.

# Charlie Shrem

Charlie Shrem is a prominent figure in the crypto community. In his early twenties,¬†Shrem co-founded BitInstant, a company that facilitated Bitcoin transactions.

At that time, he accumulated a substantial amount of Bitcoin, which he later sold for a considerable profit.

Despite facing legal issues related to money laundering,¬†Shrem remains an influential figure¬†in¬†the crypto market . In fact, he is now involved in numerous¬†*blockchain-*¬†based projects.

# 50 Cent

Rapper and entrepreneur¬†Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, made a¬†startling discovery¬†in 2018. He realized he had made millions from Bitcoin without even realizing it.

In 2014,¬†50 Cent allowed fans to purchase his album ‚ÄúAnimal Ambition‚Äù¬†using Bitcoin. He reportedly made around 700 BTC from the sales, which was forgotten about until the¬†cryptocurrency‚Äôs price skyrocketed.

His Bitcoin holdings were worth more than $7 million at the time of discovery.

# Learning from Bitcoin investors

The stories of these¬†Bitcoin investors¬†serve as a testament to the incredible opportunities that the crypto market presents.

From the Winklevoss Twins' initial investment¬†to 50 Cent's windfall, these individuals have turned their foresight and¬†risk-¬†taking into substantial wealth.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and expand, it remains to be seen what new success stories will emerge.

One thing is clear , however: the potential¬†for life-changing returns has made Bitcoin and other digital assets a compelling investment for many.

Past performance is not indicative of¬†future¬†results. Nonetheless, the journeys of these Bitcoin millionaires offer valuable insight and inspiration for those interested in the crypto market.

With careful research, strategic planning¬†, and a little luck, the next wave of¬†crypto investors¬†can join the ranks of these success stories.

Back From the Dead? John McAfee's Twitter Used to Promote Solana AI Token,bitfate,1i9n40w,2025-01-25 08:38:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9n40w/back_from_the_dead_john_mcafees_twitter_used_to/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: John McAfee's Legacy Reborn as AI Memecoin

In a surprising turn of events, the late John McAfee's legacy has been revived in the form of an AI-driven memecoin called AIntivirus. The announcement, made through McAfee's X account, sparked both excitement and skepticism among the crypto community.

The AIntivirus token, launched on January 23, quickly gained traction, reaching a market cap of $100 million within five hours before stabilizing around $27 million. Despite its volatile start, the token's price fluctuated between $0.27 and $1 in its initial trading hours.

Janice McAfee, John's wife, is behind the initiative, which aims to combine John McAfee's advocacy for privacy, crypto, decentralized technology, and AI capabilities. The project promises to integrate AI tools for cybersecurity, a nod to John McAfee's antivirus software fame.

However, the authenticity of the launch has been questioned, with some speculating that McAfee's account might have been hacked. Blockchain security service PeckShield initially warned of a potential hack but later retracted the statement.

The AIntivirus project is positioned as a ""string of defiance wrapped in cryptographic brilliance"" that represents freedom, privacy, and a stance against the establishment. This aligns with John McAfee's outspoken and often controversial persona in the crypto space.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, with BTC testing all-time highs above $100,000, memecoins like AIntivirus are gaining attention. However, their performance often mirrors broader trends, with initial hype sometimes outpacing sustained demand.

"Coinbase CEO Says Trump Forcing Everyone to Up Their Crypto Game, Here‚Äôs why!",draqai,1i9mdnh,2025-01-25 07:56:49,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9mdnh/coinbase_ceo_says_trump_forcing_everyone_to_up/,MammothBattle33,,"üöÄ Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has set the crypto world on fire after revealing that none other than Donald Trump is shaking things up in the blockchain scene. According to Armstrong, Trump‚Äôs bullish stance on digital currencies is leaving no room for slackers in the tech and finance industries. Imagine that‚Äî44th POTUS turning into a catalyst for crypto innovation. Wild, right?

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump‚Äôs impact stole the spotlight. Armstrong mentioned that discussions about digital assets took center stage among world leaders, crypto firms, and even traditional institutions. Whether you love or hate him, Trump‚Äôs influence is undeniable, forcing everyone to step up their crypto and blockchain game or get left behind. Talk about pressure!

But that‚Äôs not all. Armstrong didn‚Äôt stop at Trump. He shared that conversations also drifted to rising stars like AI and decentralized finance. Combine that with the crypto-forward actions of leaders like El Salvador‚Äôs President Bukele and Argentina's President Millei, and it feels like a seismic shift is coming. Crypto and freedom‚Äîand maybe a little chaos?‚Äîcould be the new revolution.  

For investors and institutions, the name of the game is adaptability. Armstrong hinted that companies‚Äîyes, even those stuffy old banks‚Äîare scrambling to adopt crypto to stay relevant. Still, challenges like stubborn regulations and concerns over $BTC and $USDT stability linger in the shadows. 

So, what‚Äôs the bigger picture? A high-speed race in the financial world driven by none other than Trump. Whether this acceleration births innovation or unexpected hurdles, one thing‚Äôs clear: the future is digital.

Are you ready to roll with the punches or stand at the edge and watch history unfold? ü§î

The leading cryptocurrency continues to show strength after a rollercoaster week, fueling optimism among investors. With the all-time high of $109,300 in sight, the bulls see a clear path for further gains if $BTC can break through the $110,000 mark.

Renowned analyst Axel Adler highlights how $BTC has outpaced traditional assets like gold and oil by a staggering tenfold over the last five years. This incredible performance is solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a premier global asset and a preferred alternative for younger investors seeking transparency, liquidity, and long-term growth potential. 

Although challenges remain from broader macroeconomic pressures, $BTC's capped supply and increasing adoption showcase why it continues to dominate financial markets. Investors are now eagerly watching for Bitcoin‚Äôs next big move, with key levels in play to either push it into uncharted territory or test its resilience below $100,000.

If the current 3month DOGE chart is anything like the July-Sep 2020 BTC chart, which you can see a nearly identical candles chart patterns, then we are in for a giant treat any day here. And I mean big, in conparison BTC went from 9k to 40k over the course of the following 6 months it shot from 9k to 65k.

I know DOGE is not BTC but overall IF these patterns prove similar then we should see life changing pump withing 1-3 weeks from now. 

This is neither a technical analysis nor financial advice. Just looking for any good news to remain calm optimistic. Some got bags bleeding out right now but this is the final shakeout before the life changing pump arrives. 

Crazy thing is how similar these patterns occur over the same period of time and right before the true bull run pump. "

Altseason? Delayed or done for?,CryptoMarkets,1i9iwj4,2025-01-25 03:51:01,12,0.62,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i9iwj4/altseason_delayed_or_done_for/,Kelpie-ardbeg,SENTIMENT,"So, here‚Äôs the thing: bitcoin used to have this pretty straightforward cycle that dictated the entire market.

Back in those days, altcoins weren‚Äôt traded directly against stablecoins like USDT. Instead, the alt/BTC pair was the main way to trade alts. If you wanted to buy an altcoin, you had to go through BTC first. This created a natural flow of money between BTC and altcoins, which played a big role in how the market moved.

When BTC pumped and reached a consolidation phase, the money would flow into altcoins, triggering what we know as ‚Äúaltseason.‚Äù On the other hand, when BTC dropped, altcoins would crash even harder. This cycle was simple but consistent. BTC would rise to a target level, traders would sell BTC to buy altcoins, and altcoins would rally. Eventually, profits would flow back into BTC, and it would stabilize at higher levels. This pattern remained intact up until 2021.

What Changed?
This time around, with ETFs being approved and big players like institutional investors and VC funds entering the market, the game has shifted. Instead of money rotating into altcoins after BTC pumps, funds either stay stagnant or even leave the market entirely. For the first time, a BTC rally hasn‚Äôt triggered a proper altseason.

Why?
The key reason is institutional involvement. These institutions prioritize BTC dominance and long-term stability over speculative opportunities in altcoins. Alts, with their higher risk and volatility, just aren‚Äôt worth the trouble for them.

There was some hope that BTC‚Äôs rise might eventually lead to a second wave of altcoin activity, but that belief has largely faded. The market is being flooded with thousands of new altcoins while overall liquidity continues to shrink. Institutions aren‚Äôt touching alts, and retail traders no longer have the same power they once did to drive the market.

Even the mini-altseasons that used to occur during BTC‚Äôs consolidation phases are gone. Instead, altcoins are losing even more liquidity, as if they‚Äôre being treated like dead weight. This is something we‚Äôve never seen before in crypto history.

What Now?
At this point, waiting for a traditional altseason might be wishful thinking. The dynamics of the market have fundamentally changed, and it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll see the same cycles repeat anytime soon. If you‚Äôre holding a bag of alts, it might be time to rethink your strategy because the days of easy altcoin pumps might be behind us."

His advice was clear: Invest in Bitcoin rather than MSTR if you don't understand MSTR. There was a lot of buying recently, so logically the stock couldn't go up.

Saylor knows that BTC is at a discount right now and therefore buys as much as possible. If you believe BTC will be worth more in the future, then you shouldn't worry about MSTR. If you still worry, then you didn't study enough. Just sell and buy later when it's worth 1k or more."

**Overall:**

ETFs remain at the center of crypto market narratives, bringing the potential for significant inflows‚Äîespecially if recent proposals receive the green light. BTC‚Äôs dual signals of FOMO-driven short-term interest and rising long-term greed suggest a market prone to volatility but underpinned by solid demand. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs hands-on involvement and Solana‚Äôs high-profile memecoin activity highlight how rapidly politics and hype can reshape the industry‚Äôs direction. As always, market participants should balance optimism with caution in this fast-evolving environment.

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO. FYI CEO of this company is doing a fireside chat on Tuesday in case you wanna shill an $ETH MicroStrategy approach for him lol."

I‚Äôd love to hear about any experiences or guidance on this. 

Has anyone thought about selling BTC in cold storage and moving the cash into RRSPs and TFSAs to purchase crypto ETFs?

BTC profits as I understand it are subject to capital gains tax. If someone held more than half but less than a full bitcoin in cold storage and made between 120-160 k a year on top of that, but the move still be lucrative?

I‚Äôm guessing that we will see more crypto ETFs in the very near future, and despite a bit of a tax hit (assuming say 60-70 k in contribution room in both RRSP and TFSA), would it be a worthy move?


Thanks for any thoughts. "
Bitcoin And Altcoins? Trump‚Äôs Order On ‚ÄòDigital Asset Stockpile‚Äô Explained,Blockviews,1i9g720,2025-01-25 00:37:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9g720/bitcoin_and_altcoins_trumps_order_on_digital/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Trump charts a new course for U.S. crypto policy  

In a historic move, former President Trump has issued the first-ever executive order focused on cryptocurrencies, stirring waves in the digital asset world. At its core, the order proposes the creation of a ‚Äúnational digital asset stockpile,‚Äù sparking speculation about whether the U.S. intends to go on a $BTC buying spree or simply hold onto confiscated cryptos acquired through legal channels.  

The directive calls for a Working Group to assess strategies for building and maintaining this reserve, using assets lawfully seized by federal agencies. However, the lack of clarity on whether altcoins like $ETH or $XRP will make the cut has left experts scratching their heads.  

Crypto advocates are weighing in. Dennis Porter of Satoshi Act Fund commended the administration's forward-thinking approach, emphasizing the broader term ‚Äúdigital asset‚Äù to encompass a range of possibilities. Meanwhile, analyst MacroScope believes this could be the beginning of a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" with a clear timeline, as the Working Group has just six months to recommend action.  

On another front, Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äînow chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets‚Äîis pushing for a legislative effort to create a massive $BTC reserve, targeting 1 million coins over five years. She views this as essential to bolstering the U.S. dollar's long-term relevance.  

Trump‚Äôs ambitious two-pronged strategy‚Äîcombining the executive order with Lummis‚Äôs legislative muscle‚Äîindicates the U.S. might not just hold but actively acquire $BTC in the near future.  

As of now, $BTC trades at $104,949, underscoring its growing status as a strategic asset.

BlackRock Now Holds $60 Billion In Bitcoin!,draqai,1i9fyhw,2025-01-25 00:23:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9fyhw/blackrock_now_holds_60_billion_in_bitcoin/,MammothBattle33,,"üåü BlackRock's Bitcoin Power Play: A $60 Billion Game-Changer üåü  

Crypto lovers, it‚Äôs time to grab your popcorn because BlackRock is making serious moves in the Bitcoin universe. With a jaw-dropping $60 billion now in BTC through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio is flexing harder than your gym crush on leg day. Holding a colossal 574,118 BTC, they‚Äôve now left MicroStrategy in the dust. Feels like a crypto soap opera, doesn‚Äôt it?  

Bitcoin ETFs have been on fire too, pulling in $188.7 million in recent inflows. But guess what? A spicy $154.6 million of that belongs to our main player, BlackRock. That‚Äôs 81% of the total net inflows. Mic drop, anyone? Larry Fink, the mastermind CEO of BlackRock, has even teased a potential $700,000 BTC price‚Äîif institutions keep sliding into Bitcoin‚Äôs DMs, that is.  

So, what‚Äôs the tea for all memecoin lovers? Well, if BTC keeps this momentum, it could ripple across the entire crypto universe, lifting alts like $ETH, $DOGE, and our fave gems like $SHIB and $SOL. This could mean massive opportunities‚Äîor spicy volatility‚Äîfor the broader #bitcoin and #cryptocurrency community.  

By the way, this level of institutional activity is like having champagne at a frat party. BlackRock is showing the world that Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just digital gold; it‚Äôs quickly becoming Wall Street‚Äôs secret weapon.

Help Aaron recover from Scam and spread Awareness,fundraiser,1i9d71g,2025-01-24 21:45:15,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9d71g,Wise_Space7218,,"Screenshots were limited before they blocked him.


Hi, my name is Ryan, and I‚Äôm organizing this fundraiser to help Aaron, who recently fell victim to a devastating scam that drained his hard-earned savings. Scams like these affect thousands of people every year, leaving them financially and emotionally devastated.

Aaron was scammed out of $2,000 when a 'Company' tried to contact him with a job opportunity, this was through the app Telegram. Unaware of the scams possible on Telegram, he started talking to the 'Company', they started giving him small easy tasks that you could make $5 from each, such as liking posts or videos, or even visiting websites. They started to actually pay him, through Bitcoin, which should have been his sign to stop, but as he was already struggling to find a job, and a dropout with no support, he was desperate.

They paid him up to $300, (all of this was through BTC) and he didn't put in a dime, so they must be real right? Wrong, they told him deposit $300, he didnt mind, he wasn't losing anything, then they asked him to finish the task and deposit $500 more. He agreed and they asked him again, ""This is the last payment"" they said, but again they lied. Finally, he sent a huge, stupid amount of $1500. He had already lost everything, and again, they asked for more, he didn't have anything left.

He had called me in the evening, basically on the verge of S*icide, as he had lost all his money, had no support, lived alone, and was begging me to help. I have been checking on him regularly, giving him food and supplies to cook with, but his rent will be due soon and I fear for him. He is a very good person, who's just made a bad mistake. He is looking for any sort of job, but has been very hard for him, and
this has left him struggling to recover and in need of support.

Why This Matters:
Beyond helping Aaron rebuild, this fundraiser aims to raise awareness about scams to prevent others from falling victim. Together, we can spread the word about these dangers and support those who‚Äôve been impacted. Please people, do not fall for these scams of easy money, there is no easy money in life. These scams can harm our elders, and from my friends experience, even in there 30's. This scam is not the only one, hundreds of thousands of good people get scammed out of thousands, and this is only one case.

I have talked with him and he is to modest to ask for money, and so, I am asking for him, please help and donate whatever you can to help him get back on his feet.

!!!!!!If we can reach the goal, then all extra donations will be going towards SCAM REDUCTION. Please help us fight these people who take advantage of people that are in desperate situations.!!!!!!!!!!

How Your Donation Helps:
Help Aaron recover from this financial loss.
Support efforts to create and share resources on scam prevention.
Raise awareness to protect others in our community.
Even if you can‚Äôt donate, sharing this fundraiser with your friends and family can make a huge difference. Let‚Äôs come together to help Aaron recover and fight back against scammers.

Thank you for your kindness and support!

Nasdaq takes a bold leap, filing an updated rule proposal to allow in-kind redemptions for BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin ETF ($IBIT). This change means investors could soon receive their $BTC directly during redemptions, sidestepping the need to convert holdings into cash.  

The new mechanism simplifies operations, trims tax implications, and caters to institutional players demanding greater efficiency. Previously, issuers like BlackRock had to liquidate $BTC and return cash, leading to extra layers of complexity and potential tax hits.  

If given the green light, this represents a win for crypto ETFs. Adding the option for in-kind processes could push issuers to embrace this model broadly, bridging digital assets with traditional finance more seamlessly.  

Is this the evolution Bitcoin ETFs needed to bring more power to investors? We'll find out soon enough. Stay tuned for regulatory updates.

Ripple: The Biggest Obstacle For A Bitcoin Reserve? Garlinghouse Claps Back,Blockviews,1i9bxhy,2025-01-24 20:37:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9bxhy/ripple_the_biggest_obstacle_for_a_bitcoin_reserve/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Is Ripple Lobbying Against a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?  

The crypto world is abuzz after former President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order to explore a digital asset strategic reserve, a move that steers clear of CBDCs while promoting American dominance in digital financial tech. While the order doesn‚Äôt directly name $BTC, the controversy is heating up fast with Ripple and $XRP in the spotlight.  

Pierre Rochard, a noted $BTC advocate, recently stirred the pot by accusing Ripple of lobbying to derail a Bitcoin-only strategic reserve. Rochard claims Ripple is pushing for a diversified crypto reserve, pouring millions into lobbying and reviving criticisms of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen‚Äôs financial ties to campaigns targeting Bitcoin mining. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple‚Äôs CEO, has clapped back, defending the company's efforts as increasing the chance of a broader crypto reserve that could even include $BTC.  

The debate has left the crypto audience divided, with some praising Bitcoin‚Äôs focus as an energy-efficient commodity, while others question Ripple‚Äôs motives. Will this clash influence the future of digital asset reserves? Time will tell, but one thing is clear: the lobbying battlefield for crypto dominance in Washington is intensifying.

1. \- Price Action
2. \- RSI
3. \- Stochastics
4. \- The Jewel Lite
5. \- VRVP

We could grind out in the 1.20 area for awhile tbh but this would be fine as most are staking for yield with their stacks anyway. The charts are showing that this is a good time to swap from BTC to STX. We are very likely at least due for a bounce at some point so essentially if you are bullish on BTC than it makes sense to be bullish on STX as STX will likely rise more than BTC based on this chart. Obviously this is assuming we see a bounce in the STX/BTC pairing. STX/USD is also coming to a point where it could double bottom assuming the 1.20 price holds as a new local low. Time will tell, but as the saying goes, "" A rising tide floats all boats"" , if BTC goes up its likely everything else goes up and STX will have a stong bull-case if momentum shifts to its side. My only caveat is that if we lose the 1.20 low we likely head down to around the 70-90 cents area which would prob mean bitcoin is still going through sideways price action.

The online casino uses Bitcoin (I have about 0.65 BTC) . I swear i religiously invest in vfv and a few hand-picked stocks. I don‚Äôt find gambling entertaining. 

I am not a professional gambler at all. I also don‚Äôt hold much crypto. My understanding is that holding crypto long term then swapping to fiat currency like CAD (for a gain) is treated like a capital gain. I also understand that gaming winnings are not taxable. Am I right to assume that my crypto winnings on Stake are not taxable? Can I just transfer the winnings to my wallet, and keep track of that?

$ANARCHY - Making crypto anarchic again!,CryptoMarsShots,1i99nlk,2025-01-24 18:47:54,92,0.93,23,https://i.redd.it/gnjn132141fe1.jpeg,Niemals_Wieder,Solana,"ANARCHY on SOL is taking crypto back to its roots and making it anarchic again! Remember when crypto was supposed to be disruptive tech? Well ANARCHY is everything a cryptocurrency is supposed to be: truly decentralized with fair distribution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are inherently anarchistic.

One needs to look no further than Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoin White Paper to see that anarchist ideas inspired Satoshi to create BTC. The White Paper‚Äôs first footnote gives a nod of approval to the b-money proposal developed by cypherpunk Wei Dai, with whom Satoshi had a history of correspondence with. The proposal opens with, ‚ÄúI am fascinated by Tim May‚Äôs crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ‚Äòanarchy‚Äô, in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary.‚Äù 

Both cryptocurrency and anarchism stand for decentralization, anti-authoritarianism, anti-establishment, reacting against corrupt governments and financial institutions, and the importance of strong community. According to crypto-anarchist writer Sterlin Lujan, ‚ÄúBitcoin was meant to function as a monetary weapon, as a cryptocurrency poised¬†to undermine authority.‚Äù 

Unfortunately, cryptocurrency has now been hijacked by bankers, governments, and billionaires, all the things that cryptocurrency was created to combat! It‚Äôs time to return control of our finances back to the the people.

ANARCHY honors its past while lighting the way for a new age in crypto. This movement has reignited a desire to bring back the revolutionary and subversive aspects of cryptocurrency. If you‚Äôre tired of the same repetitive and hackneyed meme coins, look no further! We have the message and the conviction needed to make crypto anarchic again!

Bitcoin ETFs In Focus As Kansas Senator Proposes Up To 10% Pension Fund Allocation,Blockviews,1i99fzs,2025-01-24 18:37:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i99fzs/bitcoin_etfs_in_focus_as_kansas_senator_proposes/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Kansas Proposes Bitcoin for Retirement Portfolios  

Kansas might soon get a crypto twist in its retirement plans! Senator Craig Bowser has put forth Senate Bill 34, a proposal to allow the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) to allocate up to 10% of its funds into $BTC exchange-traded fund products. If approved, this would mark a significant shift in the way public employee retirement funds are managed.  

The bill goes all in on local support, suggesting that only Kansas-based investment firms would be eligible to issue the $BTC ETFs. One interesting caveat: the KPERS board won‚Äôt need to sell off Bitcoin if its value exceeds the 10% threshold unless it‚Äôs in the best interest of beneficiaries. To keep the strategy in check, an annual review would be required, with results sent directly to the governor.  

Bitcoin seems to be gaining favor in state-level economic plans across the US. With North Dakota exploring $BTC for inflation control and Oklahoma proposing to pay salaries in cryptocurrency, the winds of change are blowing nationwide. Even Massachusetts is rumored to be eyeing $BTC reserves.  

That said, not everyone‚Äôs on board. The Federal Reserve remains vocal about its opposition to the Bitcoin train. While critics debate, the market stays unfazed ‚Äî $BTC is currently trading at $105,486, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours.  

Has Kansas sparked a new wave of crypto optimism among state governments? Eyes are now on lawmakers as the bill begins its journey through the legislative process.

MicroStrategy Announces Full Redemption of Convertible Notes Due 2027,draqai,1i994kc,2025-01-24 18:23:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i994kc/microstrategy_announces_full_redemption_of/,MammothBattle33,,"üöÄ MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bold Moves Light Up the Crypto World ü™ô

Hey, crypto babes and memecoin dreamers, let's talk about a company that's taking the Bitcoin game to a whole new level. MicroStrategy just dropped some mega news, and trust me, it's the kind of stuff that makes $BTC fans' hearts race. The tech giant, famous for its jaw-dropping 2,500% stock surge since 2022, is flexing hard again.

First off, they've announced the full redemption of their 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027, worth a cool $1.05 billion. The deadline for noteholders to convert these into shares? February 20, 2025. At $142.38 a share, that conversion rate could spice things up in the market big time.

But hold up‚Äîthe juicy details don‚Äôt stop there! MicroStrategy is stacking $BTC like it‚Äôs a Black Friday sale. After scooping up another 11,000 BTC recently, their wallet boasts a wild 461,000 bitcoins. That‚Äôs roughly $47 billion in digital gold they‚Äôre sitting on. And how did they pull this off? By issuing and selling more of their increasingly valuable shares. Talk about playing the long game.

If you think they‚Äôre slowing down, think again. Shareholders are all in, approving a mind-blowing increase in authorized shares from 330 million to... drumroll please... 10.3 billion. Translation: these folks are gearing up to plunge deeper into the $BTC ocean.

Why does this matter? MicroStrategy‚Äôs daring approach not only boosts confidence in institutional Bitcoin adoption but also lights a fire for smaller crypto projects (hello, $SHIB and $DOGE lovers) dreaming of going big. Who‚Äôs ready for even more FOMO in 2025?

In a significant development that could send ripples through the cryptocurrency market, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has hinted that the continued adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) could drive its price to multiples of its current value. This optimistic outlook comes as BlackRock and other financial giants are gearing up for the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The approval of these ETFs is seen as a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, as it would significantly expand access to BTC for institutional investors. According to industry insiders, the launch of these ETFs could have a legitimizing effect on BTC, similar to what was observed with gold ETFs in the past. This could lead to a substantial increase in demand, driving the price of BTC upward.

The integration of BTC into mainstream financial portfolios is also expected to grow, with many financial advisors considering allocations of between 1% to 5% of their clients' portfolios to BTC. While this may seem like a small percentage, it represents a massive amount of capital given the scale of institutional investment.

In addition to the ETF news, the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant trends in 2025. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is becoming increasingly prominent, with AI agents expected to play a crucial role in maximizing yield and driving engagement in DeFi projects. Ethereum (ETH) continues to innovate with its Layer 2 scaling solutions and energy-efficient protocols, while stablecoins like USDT and USDC are gaining traction in global trading and decentralized finance.

The gaming industry is also embracing cryptocurrencies, with Play-to-Earn (P2E) games and NFT technology creating new economic opportunities for players. Solana (SOL) is emerging as a popular platform for new projects and meme coins, and XRP is gaining ground in facilitating international money transfers.

As the cryptocurrency market expands into new sectors such as gaming, finance, and digital services, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of significant growth and innovation.
