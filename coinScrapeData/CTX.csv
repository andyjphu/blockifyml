For anyone interested- cryptex is an interesting coin.  Low market cap, one of the smaller AI coins available.  Currently at $5, but was over $20 at last bill run.  Low circulating amount.  Poised to make a big jump in next 6 months.  Check out their website @ https://cryptex.finance

They just released pi which I think is a big step up in the AI crypto world.  "

Hey there. This prompt is for a food crop scientist persona. It gives the model expertise in all sorts of related skills like CRISPR-cas9 gene engineering and all sorts of sustainable stuff. Just run on a model like ChatGPT (by pasting it into the chat window, Instructions in a CustomGPT, or System pane on playground, for example) and you should get performance in those domains about as well as the model can provide. Just talk with her naturally to interface. Should start up with an introduction. Please share with any food scientist or ag types. There's a lot of folks facing food insecurity this year. Great on 3.5, but is a rockstar on 4.  


\[Note: This works fine on ChatGPT. Different models sometimes need a bit of tweaking to the role adoption language at the top. A preface directing it to ""Please adopt the role in the prompt below. Thanks!:"" or similar should suffice if it doesn't take.\]

"Helping the above average John guy understand the Defi space : Decentralized indices, The DeFi ETF Landscape, Index Cooperative (INDEX), Indexed Finance (NDX), PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power (CVP), How to compare them, risks and notable mentions",CryptoCurrency,16yvrtu,2023-10-03 12:01:44,0,0.44,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16yvrtu/helping_the_above_average_john_guy_understand_the/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**""Decentralized indices? I don't remember talking at all about them.""** Don't panic John, here is what they are :

They are like crypto portfolios you can invest in without monitoring each coin. They're similar to traditional ETFs that track assets like stocks or commodities. ETFs have historically had good returns. In 2021, decentralized indices had about $234 million in assets, and this could grow massively. These indices help you diversify your investments with less effort.

Indices protocols are like asset managers, and index tokens are like ETFs. Owning index tokens means you own a share of the portfolio and get profits as the assets grow. Some protocols also have governance tokens, giving you a say in how the index works.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Before going into more details, let's take a look at the DeFi ETF Landscape (2021 data):***

In the world of DeFi ETFs (crypto portfolios), Index Cooperation is the big player with 60% of the market. PowerPool has 14%, and Indexed Finance has 12%. Even though there are more than 20 DeFi index tokens available, this market isn't too crowded. The total value in these DeFi ETFs is just 0.3% of all DeFi assets. Now Johny, let's explore the top 3 DeFi ETF providers: Index Cooperative, PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power, and Indexed Finance. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok fellow crypto bro, tell me more about Index Cooperative (INDEX).""** It's my pleasure :

This is one of the first decentralized indices protocols. It was created by Set Labs Inc., the same company behind Set Protocol.

With Index Coop, people can invest in a wide range of cryptocurrencies without buying them individually. If you own their index tokens, you essentially own a piece of the assets in that index.

Index Coop partners with different data providers, called methodologists, who decide the strategy for each index. As of April 2021, they offer five indices:

1. DeFiPulse Index (DPI)
2. CoinShares Crypto Gold Index (CGI)
3. ETH 2x Flexible Leverage Index (ETH2X-FLI)
4. BTC 2x Flexible Leverage Index (BTC2X-FLI)
5. Metaverse Index Token (MVI).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What is up with the Indexed Finance (NDX)?""** Here is your answer John :

This is a protocol that's all about managing portfolios. People can create, exchange, or remove the index tokens and the assets they represent. They use an Automated Market Maker system borrowed from Balancer to automatically balance their indices.

The team behind Indexed Finance consists of five members, with one choosing to remain anonymous.

As of April 2021, they offer seven different indices:

1. DEGEN Index (DEGEN)
2. Cryptocurrency Top 10 Tokens Index (CC10)
3. Oracle Top 5 Index (ORCL5)
4. DEFI Top 5 Tokens Index (DEFI5)
5. NFT Platform Index (NFTP)
6. 484 Fund (ERROR)
7. Future Of Finance Fund (FFF)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And the last one with this long ass name : PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power (CVP)?""** Please watch your language boy. Here is my answer : 

PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power (CVP) is a set of intelligent pools built on Balancer's Automated Market Maker (AMM) with some extra features. These pools are designed to bring together governance tokens for tasks like lending, borrowing, and making decisions about governance rules. Users can also directly trade one governance token for another within these pools.

PowerPool is managed by an anonymous team and offers four different pools:

1. Power Index Pool Token (PIPT)
2. Yearn Ecosystem Token Index (YETI)
3. ASSY Index (ASSY)
4. Yearn Lazy Ape (YLA)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""How should I compare those?""** The answer is really simple John : 

1. **Protocol fees**: This is how much it costs to use the protocol or buy its tokens. It's like a membership fee.
2. **Protocol strategies**: These are the methods the protocol uses to manage and invest the assets in its index. It's like their game plan.
3. **Fund weighting**: This is how the assets in the index are divided and balanced. Think of it as how they spread the money around.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Let's break down the fees for these protocols, shall we?**

**Index Cooperative**: They charge management fees, which are shared between them and the methodologist. For example, DPI has a fee of 0.95%, CGI is 0.60%, and FLI is 1.95%. Only FLI has an exit fee of 0.1%, but there are no exit fees for DPI and CGI.

**Indexed Finance**: They have a 2% swap fee, which is applied when you swap tokens within the index. This fee goes to liquidity providers. However, if you use all the underlying assets when you create or redeem an index token, this fee doesn't apply. There's also a fixed 0.5% fee when you redeem an index token, and this fee goes to NDX token holders.

**PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power**: They have three types of fees: entry, swap, and exit fees. When you create an index token, you pay a 0.1% entry fee. Swapping one governance token for another incurs a 0.2% fee, which is divided between liquidity providers and the treasury. Exiting the index comes with an additional 0.1% fee.

Comparing these fees, Index Coop charges the highest, earning them the most revenue. Indexed Finance relies mainly on the 0.5% exit fee. PowerPool has a mix of fees from minting, swapping, and exiting.

If you're a long-term investor John, consider that PIPT is the least expensive option compared to DPI and DEFI5, especially if you don't want ongoing costs like DPI's 0.95% annual fee.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Now, for their strategies :** 

**Index Cooperative**: They have a rigorous process. First, new product ideas are discussed with their community. Then, a product application goes to the governance forum. After that, they have two snapshot votes: one for vetting review and another for product release. It's quite thorough, and, for example, it took around three months to launch the Flexible Leveraged Index (FLI).

**Indexed Finance**: They move relatively quickly. For instance, their first index fund, ORCL5, took only 18 days from voting to launch.

**PowerPool Concentrated Voting Power**: Their latest product, Yearn Lazy Ape, had its governance vote on January 17, 2021, but it didn't launch until almost three months later on March 3, 2021.

Currently, Index Coop and Powerpool each have four index products, while Indexed Finance has seven.

Indexed Finance seems to be the fastest at launching indices, but Index Coop and PowerPool take more time to ensure their products are safe and well-considered. Indexed Finance might slow down a bit with its Sigma program, which involves collaborations with external partners and could take longer. For example, the DEGEN index fund, a collaboration with Redphonecrypto, was announced in December 2020 but only went live three months later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Now, for the last part, the fund weighting :** 

1. **Market Cap Weighted (e.g., DPI)**: This method looks at each token's market cap and assigns them a weight based on how big they are compared to others in the index. It means tokens with larger market caps have a bigger influence on the index's performance.
2. **Square Root of Market Cap Weighted (e.g., DEFI5)**: Here, the index considers the square root of each token's market cap in relation to the others. This method tones down the impact of tokens with really large market caps.
3. **Equally-Weighted Market Cap Weighted (e.g., PIPT)**: In this approach, all tokens get the same weight. For instance, if there are eight tokens in the index, each gets a 12.5% weight. This method treats all tokens equally, whether they have large or small market caps, and is influenced by their price movement.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""They come with risks, aren't they?""** Always have been amigo :

1. **Code is Law**: Even though the top protocols are audited, remember that audits don't make them completely immune to hacks. Crypto has seen its share of breaches, and once funds are lost, they're usually gone for good.
2. **Mercenary Capital**: Many protocols use liquidity mining programs to attract liquidity providers, but much of this capital is just looking for the highest returns. When a better deal comes along, they'll leave. When these rewards dry up, it can lead to a rush of withdrawals and harm the protocol.
3. **Systemic Risk**: DeFi protocols are often built on top of one another, like a stack of money Legos. While this allows for innovation, it also introduces a new kind of risk. If one protocol in the stack has a problem, it can affect all the others relying on it. For example, PowerPool's Yearn Lazy APE has exposure to ten different risks from its five Yearn stablecoin vaults.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What if I want to work with other protocols?""** Why you got to be so curious John... Here is what you want : 

1. **BasketDAO - Interest Bearing DPI (BDPI)**: BDPI, created by BasketDAO, is like a more profitable version of DPI. It takes the assets in DPI and lends them out to platforms like Aave and Compound to generate extra yield. This means that holding BDPI can potentially earn you higher returns compared to DPI.
2. **Cryptex Finance - Total Crypto Market Cap (TCAP)**: TCAP, developed by Cryptex Finance, gives you exposure to the entire cryptocurrency market. The team behind this project also plays a role in ETH 2.0 through Prysmatic Labs, one of the research teams that worked on it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR :***

Decentralized indices are like crypto portfolios, easy to invest in. Top providers are Index Cooperative, PowerPool, and Indexed Finance. They vary in fees, strategies, and asset allocation. Be cautious of smart contract risks. Consider alternatives like BDPI and TCAP for different benefits. 

&#x200B;

Here is the list of all the official r/CryptoCurrency Events (CCE) that have taken place on r/CryptoCurrency since they have become an official promotion, paid by burning Moons. [CCIP-043](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/ccip/043), [CCIP-047](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/ccip/047) and [CCIP-067](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/ccip/067) have since been passed to determine the pricing of all events.

Some events in the list have not incurred any Moons burn, either due to the now deprecated CCIP-047, or because of the value they presented (ie: CCE-023).

Let's talk about smart contracts, the digital agreements that power blockchain networks. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions written into code. They automatically execute transactions once the conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries and ensuring transparency and immutability. [Smart contracts](https://cryptex.net/en/bitcoin-to-cash) enable a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management and beyond. Share your favorite use cases or questions about smart contracts below! #SmartContracts #TrustInCode

We are [u/JoeCryptex](https://www.reddit.com/user/JoeCryptex) and [**u/tommatz**](https://www.reddit.com/user/tommatz/), the co-founders behind Cryptex Finance, a multi-network DeFi protocol that aims to make crypto-native markets tradable.

From 11am EST to 12pm EST today, we will host an AMA to answer your questions about Cryptex V2, our innovative decentralized perpetual markets platform. With V2, we're allowing users to trade crypto-native markets with up to 20x leverage, starting with TCAP / Total Crypto Market Cap and releasing more markets soon.

[V2 went live to the public last week with $100,000 in incentives for the first 90 days](https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-finance-launches-cryptex-v2-a-decentralized-perpetual-markets-platform-with-20x-leverage-2dbf3da1c30a), including $50,000 in our governance token, CTX, and $50,000 in Arbitrum’s governance token, ARB.

In the first week, it’s surpassed $1M+ in trading volume. You can view more data metrics about V2 on Dune [https://dune.com/sashimiboi/cryptex-v2-dashboard/0ea5f798-0b01-4018-af34-f6820554fd93](https://dune.com/sashimiboi/cryptex-v2-dashboard/0ea5f798-0b01-4018-af34-f6820554fd93)

### About Cryptex

Founded in April 2021, Cryptex Finance was created with the mission of leading the way for a more accessible, secure, and transparent financial future.

We started with the tokenization of TCAP, the world's first total crypto market cap token, and have since expanded our offerings with JPEGz, an NFT Blue-Chip Index token. We worked together with Chainlink to create highly accurate custom price oracles, and real-time market prices for the tokens we track, ensuring maximum precision in price determination through custom price oracles.

Now we're taking it a step further by introducing Cryptex V2, a groundbreaking decentralized perpetual markets platform that allows users to long or short crypto-native markets with up to 20x leverage!

This platform has been developed in collaboration with [Perennial Labs,](https://perennial.finance/) leveraging their on-chain decentralized leverage perpetual system, providing a safe, trustless trading environment. V2 is currently live on Arbitrum, providing users with low fees and quick transaction times, so try it out [here](https://v2.cryptex.finance/), and let us know what you think!

=========================================

Cryptex Finance Introduces Cryptex V2 - Trade the Entire Crypto Market Cap with up to 20x leverage!  


Hello everyone!  


We are \[u/JoeCryptex\](https://www.reddit.com/user/JoeCryptex) and \*\*\[u/tommatz\](https://www.reddit.com/user/tommatz/)\*\*, the co-founders behind Cryptex Finance, a multi-network DeFi protocol that aims to make crypto-native markets tradable.  


At 11 am EST, we will be hosting an AMA to answer any questions you have about Cryptex V2, its features, our partnerships, or anything else related to our project! So, feel free to ask away, and let's dive into the exciting world of decentralized perpetual markets!  


\### About Cryptex  


Founded in April 2021, Cryptex Finance was created with the mission of leading the way for a more accessible, secure, and transparent financial future.  


We started with the tokenization of TCAP, the world's first total crypto market cap token, and have since expanded our offerings with JPEGz, an NFT Blue-Chip Index token. We worked together with Chainlink to create highly accurate custom price oracles, and real-time market prices for the tokens we track, ensuring maximum precision in price determination through custom price oracles.  


Now, we're taking it a step further by introducing Cryptex V2, a groundbreaking platform featuring decentralized perpetual markets that allow users to long or short TCAP and eventually JPEGz with up to 20x leverage! This platform has been developed in collaboration with \[Perennial Labs,\](https://perennial.finance/) leveraging their on-chain decentralized leverage perpetual system to offer a secure and trustless way to trade in these unique markets.   


Additionally, we're thrilled to announce that Cryptex V2's decentralized perpetual markets will be launched exclusively on the Arbitrum platform, as part of our long-standing partnership.

New Tires for 2018 Crosstrek,XVcrosstrek,13h1eps,2023-05-13 23:34:58,8,0.79,25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/13h1eps,Fantastic_Win3852,,"I found a screw in my tire today and I’m assuming the tire is a goner. My tire tread is 8/32 on all four based on my last service done a few weeks ago. I’m assuming Discount Tire will tell me I need to replace all four. Anyway, I bought this 2018 Crosstrek used in December 2021 and it’ll be my first time needing to buy new tires. I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to cars. What would be your recommendation for replacements? The pic shows what Discount Tire is recommending. I currently have the OEM Geolander G91Fs but I’m not sure if they are worth using again.

PyBroker - Python Algotrading Framework with Machine Learning,algotrading,12iu751,2023-04-11 15:12:39,247,0.98,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/12iu751/pybroker_python_algotrading_framework_with/,pyfreak182,Infrastructure,"[Github Link](https://github.com/edtechre/pybroker/)

Hello, I am excited to share PyBroker with you, a free and open-source Python framework that I developed for creating algorithmic trading strategies, including those that utilize machine learning.

Some of the key features of PyBroker include:

* A super-fast backtesting engine built using NumPy and accelerated with Numba.
* The ability to create and execute trading rules and models across multiple instruments with ease.
* Access to historical data from Alpaca and Yahoo Finance, or from your own data provider.
* The option to train and backtest models using Walkforward Analysis, which simulates how the strategy would perform during actual trading.
* More reliable trading metrics that use randomized bootstrapping to provide more accurate results.
* Support for strategies that use ranking and flexible position sizing.
* Caching of downloaded data, indicators, and models to speed up your development process.
* Parallelized computations that enable faster performance.

PyBroker was designed with machine learning in mind and supports training machine learning models using your favorite ML framework. Additionally, you can use PyBroker to write rule-based strategies.

## Rule-based Example

Below is an example of a strategy that buys on a new 10-day high and holds the position for 5 days:

    from pybroker import Strategy, YFinance, highest
    
    def exec_fn(ctx):
       # Get the rolling 10 day high.
       high_10d = ctx.indicator('high_10d')
       # Buy on a new 10 day high.
       if not ctx.long_pos() and high_10d[-1] > high_10d[-2]:
          ctx.buy_shares = 100
          # Hold the position for 5 days.
          ctx.hold_bars = 5
          # Set a stop loss of 2%.
          ctx.stop_loss_pct = 2
    
    strategy = Strategy(YFinance(), start_date='1/1/2022', end_date='1/1/2023')
    strategy.add_execution(
       exec_fn, ['AAPL', 'MSFT'], indicators=highest('high_10d', 'close', period=10))
    # Run the backtest after 20 days have passed.
    result = strategy.backtest(warmup=20)

## Model Example

This next example shows how to train a Linear Regression model that predicts the next day's return using the 20-day RSI, and then uses the model in a trading strategy:

    import pybroker
    import talib
    from pybroker import Strategy, YFinance
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    def train_slr(symbol, train_data, test_data):
        # Previous day close prices.
        train_prev_close = train_data['close'].shift(1)
        # Calculate daily returns.
        train_daily_returns = (train_data['close'] - train_prev_close) / train_prev_close
        # Predict next day's return.
        train_data['pred'] = train_daily_returns.shift(-1)
        train_data = train_data.dropna()
        # Train the LinearRegession model to predict the next day's return
        # given the 20-day RSI.
        X_train = train_data[['rsi_20']]
        y_train = train_data[['pred']]
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        return model
    
    def exec_fn(ctx):
        preds = ctx.preds('slr')
        # Open a long position given the latest prediction.
        if not ctx.long_pos() and preds[-1] > 0:
            ctx.buy_shares = 100
        # Close the long position given the latest prediction.
        elif ctx.long_pos() and preds[-1] < 0:
            ctx.sell_all_shares()
    
    # Register a 20-day RSI indicator with PyBroker.
    rsi_20 = pybroker.indicator('rsi_20', lambda data: talib.RSI(data.close, timeperiod=20))
    # Register the model and its training function with PyBroker.
    model_slr = pybroker.model('slr', train_slr, indicators=[rsi_20])
    strategy = Strategy(YFinance(), start_date='1/1/2022', end_date='1/1/2023')
    strategy.add_execution(exec_fn, ['NVDA', 'AMD'], models=model_slr)
    # Use a 50/50 train/test split.
    result = strategy.backtest(warmup=20, train_size=0.5)

How To Start YouTube Automation?,YouTubeAutomators,11zkcsg,2023-03-23 09:25:45,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeAutomators/comments/11zkcsg/how_to_start_youtube_automation/,EconomicsBubbly9305,,"***HOW TO START YOUTUBE AUTOMATION???***

**1st STEP:**

Create a *good looking* YouTube channel with a good logo, background, name.

**2nd STEP:**

Pick a *niche*. A niche is what your YouTube channel will be all about. For example: sports (football, boxing, basketball), drama (social media drama/beef), finance (money making strategies)

**3rd STEP:**

*This is very important*. Got to [www.fiverr.com](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=690679&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2Fhttps://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=690679&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2Fhttps://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=690679&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2F) and create an account. **You will use fiverr to find people that will work for you and create your content.**

**4th STEP:**

Once you've created your fiverr account - find a script writer, a video editor, and a voiceover person.

Some recommendations that are proven by other YouTube Automators to generate great results:

**YouTube script-writer:** ***Dr. Sikandar Hayat*** (a professional script-writer)

He will provide:

*> Well researched topics and content*

*> Plagiarism free content*

*> Loyalty*

**YouTube voiceovers:**

Generally speaking there isn't really *the best* voice over since you might need a man's voice (for sports) or a female's voice (for drama). And you also need to consider accents. I suggest you go through this page of [Professional Voiceovers](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=690679&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2Fcategories%2Fmusic-audio%2Fvoice-overs%3Fsource%3Dcategory_tree) and pick the one that suits your niche the best!

**5th STEP:**

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the seventh monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JAN Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for nearly 5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the new features in the 2022 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***.***
* **YEAR END Highlights:** \-   Could you repeat the question?

## Month Twelve – Down -80%

https://preview.redd.it/l5rl7o6n7tca1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=e11f52921e2f95019c5ffc5da1604c81409adc3c

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC/UST, XRP, LUNA/LUNC, DOT, AVAX.**  

**Year End highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:**

* Could you repeat the question?
* **BNB** claims first place after Year 1, down -53%, followed by second place **XRP** (-61%).
* The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the five [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -80% so far.
* Surely the 2022 Portfolio had the worst start of any of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments, right?  Nope – that distinction goes to the [2018 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twelve/), which was -85% after its first year.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranking twelve months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/ww7yveco7tca1.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=51dbe1cc7adec58ee03f6b5ec35c2eeae8874e91

**AVAX, SOL, DOT,** and **LUNC** have dropped out, replaced by **BUSD, DAI, DOGE,** and **MATIC.**  

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  No winners this month, although **BTC’s** \-3% return outperformed the field.

***December Losers*** – for the second month in row, **SOL** was the worst performer of the portfolio, losing more than a quarter of its value (-28%) after losing more than half of its value the month before.

## Overall Update: BNB wins 2022 followed by second place XRP. All cryptos in negative territory. LUNC worst performing in the 2022 Portfolio and worst performing crypto of all the Top Ten Experiments.

What. A. Year.

In 2022, crypto victory means ending the year down “only” about half: **BNB** was the best performing of the Portfolio, finishing the year -53%. In distant second place was **XRP** (-61%), only then followed by the big boys: **BTC** and **ETH** fell -65% and -68%, respectively.

Ever since **LUNC’s** (then known as **LUNA**) [crash in May](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/), it has remained hopelessly at the bottom, worth a fraction of a cent.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** twelve months ago is worth $0.0002 today – the worst performance of any coin in any of the five Top Ten Experiments.  It’s hard to remember/believe that **LUNA** was the highest performing Top Ten Crypto of the first quarter of the year. 

The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is the worst performing of the five [Top Ten experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), -80% so far.

But – this is by no means the worst first year in the history of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments.  That honor goes to the [2018 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twelve/), which was -85% after its first year.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio lost -$35 this in December and $795 since January.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$205.** 

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

As you can see, there wasn’t a green month all year, although the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio flirted with the break even point in [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) and the value has remained within a tight range since [May](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5).  

## Factoring in USDC Gains

**New feature this year** – In retrospect this was not my best idea: I was a bit bored of simply holding a stable in the Top Ten as I’ve been doing since 2019, and thought I’d showcase some of the possibilities available in crypto to build on a stablecoin holding.  My plan was to start nice and easy with trusted CeFi platforms, taking advantage of sign up bonuses, then moving to the safest of DeFi (Anchor) then get into some more advanced DeFi strategy.

It was going pretty well until May.

Then LUNA happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.02, down -98%.

Two out of the three platforms I used died.  On Nexo is still around.

I took this as a good reminder that anything can and does happen in crypto and to continue to be careful. I’m thankful that the lesson only cost me $100:  I know a lot of other people got hit much, much harder.

## 2022 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)

**Another new feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 5 years, including Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects that have created index tokens to capture segments of the crypto market (DeFi, the Metaverse, Blue Chips, etc.) instead of manually buying coins and tokens ([like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).

A project of particular interest in 2022 to the Top Ten Experiments was the **Total Crypto Market Cap** ([**TCAP**](https://cryptex.finance/)) **token,** created by [Cryptex](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptex/), which tracks the entire crypto market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

I thought it would be interesting to compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to **TCAP** for a bit of a friendly competition. 

Here’s the question I’ve been tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of TCAP instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

***So, one year later, we have an answer to that question!***  **TCAP** snapshot January 1st:

**December Performances:**

* **The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio**: -15% 
* **TCAP**: -9%.

The December monthly victory goes to: **Cryptex’s Total Crypto Market Cap (TCAP) token** 

**Overall since January 1st, 2022:** 

* **The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $205 (-80%) 
* **TCAP:** current value $283 (-72%)

Overall winner is: **Cryptex’s Total Crypto Market Cap (TCAP) token** 

Visual summary below:

**TCAP’s** dominant victory (it’s been in the overall lead most of the year) is in line with what I expected and in line with the lessons learned from the Top Ten Experiments:  with the exception of the 2021 Portfolio, every year the Total Market Cap outperforms a Top Ten approach.   Here are the figures, as of 1 January 2022, with the five entry points:

* 2018 Top Ten Portfolio: -59% for the Top Ten vs. +38% for the total market cap
* 2019 Top Ten Portfolio: +126% for the Top Ten vs. +525% for the total market cap 
* 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: +251% for the Top Ten vs. +319% for the total market cap 
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio:  +40% for the Top Ten vs. +3% for the total market cap *(an outlier – if history is any indication, I expect the Top Ten gains to fall behind the Total Market Cap over time, like the other Experiments*).
* 2022 Top Ten Portfolio: -80% for the Top Ten vs. -64% for the total market cap

## Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom ended the year at 40.1%. For context, we’re about back where we started in January and there hasn’t been much movement on this metric at all in 2022. Chart below:

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it can signal appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -59% (total value $413)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +126% (total value $2,260)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35): up +251% (total value $3,513) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +40% (total value $1,402)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) down -76% (total value $240) (***worst performing portfolio****)*

Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $5,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$7,828.** 

**That’s up +57%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/dfrn6wyx7tca1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=4489f02ef329bbc96acad5093fa76716eff10f3c

&#x200B;

In summary: ***That’s a +57% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/f14j5m3z7tca1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=242bc3134b0eb9ba8d2d60a067f1d2b2d1a99a85

The S&P 500 is down -19% so far in 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $810 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,440 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,530 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,190 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,020 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $810 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After five $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $5,990.**

That is up **+20%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+57%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

So, that’s it: the end to a crazy year.  Never a dull moment in crypto…

But the last section demonstrates, if you can stomach crypto’s volatility (a big if), you’ll find better overall returns over time in crypto vs. traditional markets – at least at this point in the Experiment.

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  December’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-57), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), and [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35) reports as well."
