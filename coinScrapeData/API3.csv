[Chart performance of low cap altcoins](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-investment-calculator/custom-portfolio?period=5+year&CRV=20&API3=20&CELR=20&BAT=20&RAD=20)  
Historically, you would expect low-cap altcoins to have increased by 10x by now, but they remain at their lows. Is the crypto market becoming more mature, or do retail investors not yet feel the FOMO to 10x their money yet? At these prices, many low-cap altcoins won't survive the next crypto bear market and may go to zero. Is a cleansing on the way in the next three years?"

DGB, API3, cUSD, ERG, FLR, SHIB. LUNA.

Of those:

SHiB, cUSD, API3, ERG have been listed.

*It is obvious why LUNA was not.
*FLR was the new kid on the block, completely unproven.

And then, there's #Digibyte. I can find no obvious reason and there's plenty of decentralized provenance.  

What are your thoughts?

Low Market Cap Gems: Promising Crypto Projects Outside the Top 100,30BussinessNews,1h16yhz,2024-11-27 10:31:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/30BussinessNews/comments/1h16yhz/low_market_cap_gems_promising_crypto_projects/,30bussinessnews,,"I've been diving into some **underrated crypto projects** with low market caps that are flying under the radar. These are coins **outside the top 100** in market capitalization but have solid fundamentals, innovative ideas, or growing communities. Perfect for those looking for **high-risk, high-reward opportunities**!

Here are some of the projects I found:



# 1. Mina Protocol (MINA)

* **Why it’s interesting:** World's lightest blockchain, with a focus on Zero-Knowledge proofs. Mina enables **privacy-preserving apps** while keeping the chain lightweight (\~22 KB).
* **Market cap:** \~$200M (not in the top 100).
* **Potential use case:** Revolutionizing blockchain scalability and privacy.

# 2. Velas (VLX)

* **Why it’s interesting:** A fork of Solana with added EVM compatibility. It boasts **high transaction speed** (up to 30,000 TPS) and low fees. Backed by partnerships with projects like Ferrari Esports.
* **Market cap:** \~$70M.
* **Potential use case:** DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 apps with a focus on speed and compatibility.

# 3. Reef (REEF)

* **Why it’s interesting:** Built on Polkadot, Reef aims to be a one-stop-shop for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming with a user-friendly interface and scalability.
* **Market cap:** \~$40M.
* **Potential use case:** Bridging DeFi to retail users.

# 4. API3 (API3)

* **Why it’s interesting:** Competes with Chainlink by providing **decentralized APIs** for Web3. Focuses on data transparency and cutting out intermediaries.
* **Market cap:** \~$100M.
* **Potential use case:** Powering decentralized applications with reliable off-chain data.

# 5. Gamium (GMM)

* **Why it’s interesting:** Metaverse-focused project creating interoperable avatars and digital identities for Web3. Aims to integrate metaverse economies seamlessly.
* **Market cap:** <$30M.
* **Potential use case:** Digital identity across multiple metaverse projects.

💡 **Important Reminder:**

* These projects are high-risk because of their low market caps. Do your own research (DYOR), and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
* Look for solid teams, real-world use cases, and growing communities to separate the gems from the noise.

I have a couple of questions about the Azure API Management service:

1. Is it possible to grant access on specific APIs implementation, making users able to see some APIs but not others inside the same Azure API Management Gateway? For example: User1 can manage green ones, but not red ones.

2. Is it possible to hide only certains APIs on the developer Portal? Example: Ony API1 and API2 are visible on the Developer portal, API3 and API4 are hidden.

Thanks."

However, with 14 coins in my crypto portfolio, the performance is good enough for me. I do add more capital to these coins when the markets experience significant corrections, usually 2-3 times a year.

Crypto feels like angel investing to me; you need to have many coins in your basket because you can't predict which one will surge and gain adoption, nor can you foresee which one will fail. I can't seem to narrow down my collection.

"Oracles, blockchain innovation and the need for an innovative approach.",Crypto_General,1fdprap,2024-09-10 14:56:07,5,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1fdprap/oracles_blockchain_innovation_and_the_need_for_an/,stormingaround10,Daily Discussion,"I have always been an enthusiast when it comes to Oracle projects. I have followed the development of Chainlink, Band, API3, and Dia data for a long time. It is impressive to see consistent development, integrations, and partnerships, following all new trends. This all led me to think about their essential role in the ecosystem and the fact that in every area oracle services are crucial. As people say, data is new oil. That is why we need reliable and accurate data. Oracle projects are so important for blockchain technology. It seems that not enough attention is paid to them. 

Ethereum Book [here](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/11oracles.asciidoc) includes dissuasion of Ethereum oracle use cases the neediness of oracles, as well as other useful details we should know. Recently I came across very useful X threads about the Sight AI oracle approach, but also other products included in this project. In order to enable security and reliability in a decentralized world, Sight AI supports multiple FHE schemes and it is compatible with various heterogeneous blockchain networks. 

Development pushes the boundaries more and more, so it's smart to follow innovations closely and research carefully."

If it is to grow, then the industry’s infrastructure will see substantial development.   
If you believe blockchain has immense potential, then looking into cryptocurrencies that support the Web3 infrastructure might be a wise choice. Essentially, putting your money where your mouth is could be a strategic move. Does this make sense?

Wallet Drainer... is there any way to get out of it?,ethereum,1fbtkdp,2024-09-08 05:06:38,7,0.82,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1fbtkdp/wallet_drainer_is_there_any_way_to_get_out_of_it/,X4TheRidDler4X,,"Some time in the past I was apparently stupid in dabbling with everything Defi old and new and at some point I approved a drainer contract on my ETH account on Ledger. Now i've been pretty lucky and its not moved anything else on the entire thing except when I transfer ETH into it. Fortunately I rarely have and always just top it up with enough gas if I want to do something, but soon as it has enough gas to do a tx it moves it out to another address. At the time I realized this I moved everything else on the Ledger out to new addresses, but there is still about 3 tokens on the original ETH address that are staking away (MATIC, Graph, API3) however I can't load gas to move it. Every month or so I check to see if its still active by moving about $20 on but sadly its still there. I've read one can revoke all approvals via a website however sadly you need gas for that, which is part of the problem.

  
;TLDR Is there any way to break out of a wallet drainer contract on ETH (Ledger)?"

Which service do you recommend to move everything to Azure?,AZURE,1f4vclt,2024-08-30 09:32:23,5,0.86,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1f4vclt/which_service_do_you_recommend_to_move_everything/,MovingShadow10,Question,"On my job our bosses are considering moving into the cloud, they've started looking for people with experience in Azure in general to help us do that.

Me and my current team have zero experience with anything Azure related, so we are slowly introducing courses and other stuff for us to learn everything we can, but then it comes the problem of what exactly should we use for our current apps.

We just started using Azure DevOps for source control of our apps.

Besides moving our apps to the cloud we are expected to add things like Azure AD and SSO, but that's a different problem for later, we first need to move everything.

Our main App that's hosted on prem and we plan to move to the cloud is like this:

- A frontend, made with React

- 3 APIs made with .NET 8

- 1 extra API (API4) made with .NET Framework 4.8

They're hosted in 3 different on prem servers:

Server 1: Frontend and API1

Server 2: API2

Server 3: API3 and API4

The frontend calls API1 and that fordwards the request to API2 and then that fordwards it to API3. API4 is called by API3 on some specific requests, its not a part of the ""Main"" circuit of APIs.

  
We need to have 3 enviroments for each of the 5 parts of this project, DEV, QA and PRD. We would like to keep the same server structure we already have, but in the cloud

  
The have been talks of using APP Services for this, but recently we heard that alternative for it could be Kubermetes services too.

  
I would go for App Service since from what i understand its the easiest of the 2 to handle, Kubermetes requieres a steeper learning curve, but it gives you a lot more control of everything.

  
Ignoring costs for now, since i know that's another can of worms, Which of the 2 would you say its the better path for us to follow in the future?"
Are Decentralized Oracles the Next Big Investment?,CryptoCurrency,1exasyw,2024-08-20 19:45:05,0,0.23,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1exasyw/are_decentralized_oracles_the_next_big_investment/,Mr_Hodlerr,MARKETS,"LINK has been dominating the decentralized oracle space, while API3 has shown the highest growth in TVS. Together, decentralized oracles support around 51% of the total value locked (TVL), highlighting their significant role in the growing DeFi infrastructure. LINK and API3 stand out with impressive offerings and could become the leading oracles in this sector. At present, decentralized oracles appear undervalued.

Yesterday, OrthoChristian reported that “Greek Orthodox media is warning of attempts by the Coptic church to seize the ancient St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mt. Sinai.”

Today, August 8, His Eminence Archbishop Damianos of Mt. Sinai issued the following statement:

His Eminence Archbishop Damianos, abbot and representative of St. Catherine’s Monastery, categorically denies any connection to the news published on the website [vimaorthodoxias.gr](http://vimaorthodoxias.gr) on 7/8/2024.

He also denies any involvement of the Coptic Church in the affairs of the monastery's properties currently being circulated.

It should be noted that the relationship between St. Catherine’s Monastery and its head and the Coptic Church and His Holiness the Pope is strong and characterized by cooperation and friendship.

But it has become an alternative to lottery for many. Because when they pump they can produce 50x-100x.

* The pump mania is pretty quick and you have create partial exits during the mega pump.
* 95% people can't control their greed and keep holding.
* Some add more to the lottery system thinking they found the true coin which will give them a good retirement.

Looking at the charts below, the sharp quick moves and exit liquidity indicates that if you can't lose money or are not a profitable experienced trader then **stay away**.
