It's important to exercise caution and do thorough research before investing in any tokens or projects, especially those that are considered small-cap. These types of investments can be highly speculative and volatile, and there is always a risk of losing your investment. It's important to only invest what you can afford to lose and to seek out professional financial advice if necessary."

How launchpads work and why they‚Äôre underrated.,ethtrader,y41f05,2022-10-14 14:25:57,201,0.96,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/y41f05/how_launchpads_work_and_why_theyre_underrated/,Garatinil3,Strategy,"There are several layers when it comes to investments in the crypto space. Many people limit their trading strategies to dollar cost averaging across high or mid-cap tokens, taking part in yield generating programs such as single sided staking programs or liquidity mining events, etc. Another common approach among the real DeFi players is participating in IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). 

It‚Äôs not wrong to assume that we‚Äôre in the early days of crypto. There are countless numbers of developments going on in different sectors, including GameFi, the metaverse, Move-to-Earn, Play-to-Earn, etc. Therefore, a corresponding number of promising projects are coming onboard every month, each of them bringing something unique to the space. The majority of them begin as low caps and work themselves up on the market cap leaderboard. As you may expect, a new token doesn‚Äôt just get listed in a DEX out of the blue. A presale, otherwise known as a public sale event, takes place prior to exchange listings, giving a selected few the opportunity to buy the token at an IDO price (often much lower relative to the value the token eventually hits). This is an investment opportunity, and a brilliant one. 

Launchpads facilitate presales and IDOs, serving as the gateway for low cap projects to launch into the market after sufficient publicity and sensitization to the public. In a bull market, many have bought tokens at their IDO prices and seen massive returns (sometimes up to 500x) after it gets listed on an exchange - they then often sell at higher prices, making outrageous profits within a short period of time. In a less exciting market, you may not see such big pumps, but newly launched tokens typically pump if everything goes well. 

Despite the interesting nature of this investment strategy, every launchpad has its own peculiarities (pros and cons). Today, I‚Äôll be comparing three well known launchpads: Poolz, Polkastarter, and Uplift based on several common elements. 

**Whitelisting Criteria**

Not everyone who desires to buy new tokens at very low prices get the opportunity to do so. The demand usually surpasses the supply for a token sale event. Therefore, it makes sense that the launchpad comes up with a strategy to fairly select those who can participate. On Polkastarter, you need at least 250 POLS tokens to stand a chance of getting whitelisted. 

The barrier to entry is slightly lower with Poolz, where you can receive whitelist spots by staking as low as 50 POOLZ. On Uplift, at least $100 worth of LIFT is required to participate at the most basic levels.

Lottery-based systems are common among all of these launchpads, so don‚Äôt take it personally if you don‚Äôt get whitelisted after applying for an IDO spot. However, you can increase your chances of getting whitelisted depending on how much of the respective tokens you hold or stake. 

**Guaranteed Allocations**

There‚Äôs nothing IDO investors love more than the sound of guaranteed allocations. Getting guaranteed allocations is not an easy thing to achieve. There‚Äôs a strategy to getting them, though, but the requirement is often crazy and quite unaffordable to many. On Poolz, there was a time when you had to be positioned as a top 100 staker on their leaderboard - the requirement was later adjusted to staking at least 250 POOLZ. 

On Polkastarter, you need to be among the top 10 holders to get that kind of advantage, which requires significant capital. On Uplift it‚Äôs a little more interesting, considering the focus of the project is to make their launchpad whale resistant. There‚Äôs a maximum lottery ticket you can have as a member, but not everything can win an allocation. So, if you‚Äôre thinking about going full whale in such a system, think again. 

**Refunds & Security**

In a decentralized system, it‚Äôs quite difficult to always listen to community demands. However, the DeFi space is quite complicated and, oftentimes, unexpected things tend to happen. An example is when the price of a token falls below its IDO price. Doesn‚Äôt that defeat the whole purpose, you may ask?

Every launchpad has their own policies and methods of handling such situations. Uplift offers the IDO Price Protection Promise (PPP), something that is quite rare in the space. This feature ensures users will always receive a refund if the price of an Uplift-backed IDO token goes below the original price at TGE (Token Generation Event). On Poolz, they‚Äôve established a similar design and mechanism with its risk-free and secured model. However, Polkastarter doesn‚Äôt offer refunds of any kind - it‚Äôs actually very uncommon to see tokens listed in Polkastarter (or any launchpad whatsoever) going below their IDO price. 

**Wrapping Up**

In my opinion, the points listed above are the basic elements of any launchpad. Of course, it would be preposterous to say that I‚Äôve covered everything. If you want to learn more about them, you‚Äôve got to DYOR and see if any presale is coming up across their ecosystems. 

Perhaps it‚Äôs time to upgrade your investment strategies in DeFi."

We are back and delighted to engage with our fellow Redditors.

It‚Äôs that time again for our monthly recap and discussion post.

The big talk of the month was The Merge of ETH and the shift from a Proof- of- work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a Proof- of- stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

PoW and PoS advocates within the crypto community often debate each method‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses around network security, scalability, and decentralization. You can read our full report [here](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/58b6xidjxk44xedc), and let us know all your thoughts for our monthly discussion.

Has the theme with Polkasterter's IDOs become obsolete?,CryptoMarkets,tzuhxh,2022-04-09 10:37:32,16,0.84,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/tzuhxh/has_the_theme_with_polkasterters_idos_become/,Lakrichka,DISCUSSION,"It looks like the Polkastarter is having problems. Recently, it rarely hosts IDOs, and some projects are trading below the IDO price. The last example is the Deliq Finance project. IDO's price of $DLQ was $0.15. Now the price is $0.13. At the same time, investors' funds are frozen due to vesting. Everyone received only 25% of their tokens on listing. In #Polkastarter and Deliq chats people ask about low price, but unfortunately most of the messages are deleted by admins.

Participation in IDO is a privilege investors pay for by buying POLS tokens. Even if we have POLS it is not a guarantee of approval, we must register in each project, then answer questions, subscribe to social networks, wait if we are lucky or not. Therefore the listing price must be higher than the purchase price, otherwise it makes no sense to conduct IDO. We can buy tokens on the market, and at the same time our funds will not be frozen.

I thought that the Polkastarter gets our investments in order to filter for IDO for high-quality and honest projects. But now it feels like they are ready to place everything indiscriminately.

What do you think of all this? Has the theme with Polkastarter's IDOs become obsolete?"

How High Could DEGEN RISE?

Paul Feldstein and Edward Renshaw turned the investing world upside down in January 1960.

The college student and college lecturer presented a contentious argument in a four-page white paper.¬†

They demonstrated that by purchasing ""a corporation committed to the goal of tracking a representative average,"" passive investors may do just as well as professional asset managers.

Their study was included in the Financial Analysts Journal, a renowned publication.

Soon, John Bogle, a manager of Wellington Fund, one of the oldest and largest mutual funds at the time, published a blistering rejoinder in the journal. Bogle attempted to contradict the article's conclusions under the pen name John B. Armstrong. He refused to think that passive investments could ever be a viable alternative to active management.

If you've heard of Bogle, you already know where this is going.¬†

Only 14 years later, Bogle launched the mutual fund behemoth Vanguard Funds, which allows investors to choose funds that passively imitate indexes.¬†

Bogle is widely regarded today as the ""Father of Index Funds."" And these funds manage more than $7 trillion in investor assets.

Investors can now choose between actively managed and passively managed funds. Today, many investors define their success or failure by investing in the correct industries at the appropriate time.

The investing world is once again being turned upside down.¬†

One cryptocurrency effort is developing passive funds that are handled fairly actively by smart contracts and investors. I'm referring to decentralized, real-time-weighted index investment, in which the community chooses to add or exclude holdings.¬†

We may hold a portfolio of 11 crypto projects with significant development potential with just one investment. We believe that 1,000% gains are conceivable.¬†¬†

So, lets get started‚Ä¶.

Index Tokens are Being Introduced

As cryptocurrency investors, we approach investments in a unique way.¬†

We're investing in an asset class unfamiliar to the general public. We glance up and down while everyone else is thinking right versus left. To put it another way, we look beyond the ""x"" and ""y"" investment planes to the ""z"" plane.

That is exactly what we are doing this month...

We're looking at an active, passive investment rather than just the ""x"" of passive investing and the ""y"" of active investing.

You see, it's now feasible for anyone to access a smart contract that holds a certain basket of investments. While this would be enough to make any passive indexer proud, the smart contract also smartly and actively maintains balances and exposures according to rules that would satisfy any active manager.¬†

It's the crypto version of an index fund‚Ä¶. and the end result is smarter, easier, and less expensive than buying the same basket of tokens yourself.

¬†It's all Done via Indexed Finance

Finance is a decentralized portfolio management technology that uses ""Index Tokens"" to represent the aggregate value of underlying assets in a pool.

In a nutshell, the values of many tokens are combined into a single representative token.

Each asset in the pool is assigned a weight based on the square root of its market capitalization. The smart contract then compares this to the asset's current weight and rebalances the pool automatically as people join and leave it. The targeted weight of each asset is also updated regularly to ensure an equitable and fair distribution throughout the index pools.¬†

Anyone who holds an Index Token owns a portion of the underlying assets to which it is linked. Indexed Finance has no control over the assets that make up any Index Token pool. As a result, Index Token owners can ""burn"" their balance to redeem any of the tokens that comprise the pool for each index for a modest charge.

For example, if you hold an Index Token representing tokens XXX, YYY, and ZZZ, you might burn your balance to redeem any one of those three tokens in a fair distribution based on their current value. This is a significant feature that could lead to greater profits.

The Indexed Finance protocol is governed by the entire user community, which votes on requests for updates and changes to the protocol.

In brief, Index Tokens, like stock and bond index funds, make it simple and inexpensive to own a basket of cryptos. Unlike standard index funds, Index Tokens allow for adjustments to the underlying investments and pool weightings depending on community votes.¬†

And now is an excellent moment to buy. Because of the recent volatility, we're seeing a buyer's market for numerous cryptocurrencies. Almost any top project can be purchased for $0.30 to $0.50 on the dollar compared to where it was just 60 to 90 days ago. Patient, contrarian investors understand that making judicious investments when the market is in distress can pay off handsomely.

That brings us to‚Ä¶

DEGEN Index Token (DEGEN)

Indexed Finance presently has seven Index Tokens available. However, the DEGEN Index (DEGEN) token has caught our interest the most.

The DEGEN Index was inspired by a user's description of the need for an index comprised of high-risk, high-reward decentralized finance (""DeFi"") crypto projects on Twitter. These projects would have minor market capitalizations but significant upside potential.

The concept rapidly sparked widespread attention...

As previously said, DeFi has established ""trust less"" transactions that will alter banking as we know it through peer-to-peer lending, decentralized margin trading, stable coins, and yields that banks cannot provide.

Over the last year, the overall value of DeFi projects has risen from $1 billion to as much as $86 billion. They currently have a total value of roughly $60 billion locked in. This is an example of ""high risk, high gain.""

The DEGEN community agreed on Indexed Finance as the ideal platform to house the token a few weeks after its conception. On January 29, 2021, a proposal for the development of DEGEN was made to the Indexed Finance community.

Originally, the proposal listed 30 different tokens, but the community cut it down over time. Only 11 tokens remained after the proposal was authorized in February and presented to the market in March.

The term ""Degen"" is a condensed variant of ""degenerate."" However, this does not imply that the investment is degenerate.

Degen, like many other words, has evolved in meaning. It's similar to how the term ""criminal"" can refer to someone who engages in illegal activities or an exaggeration of how amazing something is.

So Degen may have connotations of ""degenerate gambler"" or someone who would do anything for a quick profit... but the term has been co-opted by crypto investors attempting to mimic the sense of outrageous potential gains.

Indexed Finance describes DEGEN as a high-risk, high-reward Index Token comprised of Ethereum protocols with the potential for significant growth over time. DEGEN, in a nutshell, is a laser-focused portfolio of DeFi projects that are hyper-tuned for growth.

The Ten DeFi-based tokens are as follows:

o ¬† Reserve Rights (RSR)

o ¬† 1 in (1INCH)

o ¬† RenVM (REN)

o ¬† Curve DA(CRV)

o ¬† Badger DAO (BADGER)

o ¬† Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA)

o ¬† Polkastarter (POLS)

o ¬† Oceans Protocol (OCEAN)

o ¬† Wrapped MIR(WMIR)

o ¬† Rari Governance Token (RGT)

These initiatives all meet the following requirements, according to Indexed Finance:

¬†

The token's market capitalization ranges from $50 million to $2 billion (calculated by a rolling 14-day time-weighted average price on Uniswap).

This token has been around for at least a week.

There have been no serious flaws detected in the token contract.

The supply of the token cannot be arbitrarily increased or deflated maliciously.

The control model should be explored if the supply can be changed through governance actions. The token also does not have transfer fees or other non-standard balances.¬†

Updates

The token fits the standards of the ERC-20 standard.

There is sufficient liquidity in the Uniswap market pair between the token and wrapped ETH (WETH). (WETH is exempt from this.)

The token is one of the following:

Protocol token for a project based on Ethereum.

A governance token for use in a DeFi project.

Wrapper token for a blockchain's native currency.

These requirements ensure that the pool will function properly. However, DEGEN token holders predict substantial profits because of the possible upside for each token.

So, let's look at the DEGEN Index token's underlying assets...¬†

o ¬† 1 in (1INCH)

Regular readers will recognize 1inch as a decentralized exchange (""DEX"") aggregator. When someone wishes to trade two tokens on a DEX, 1inch can help them get the best price with the lowest costs.

Because DEX exchange rates are not fixed, the more you exchange, the worse the exchange rate can get.¬†

The market can also be moved easily in tokens with significant liquidity. This is known as ""price slippage.""

1inch analyses current rates and liquidity on DEXs to find you the best exchange rate. In a nutshell, 1inch seeks to make the entire DEX process more user-friendly.

The governance token for the 1INCH protocol is 1INCH. 1INCH holders can vote on ideas for rewards, swapping fees, price impact fees, and other costs.

On the Ethereum blockchain, there are currently over 60,000 1INCH token holders. And the 1inch team is distributing tokens via airdrops over a four-year timeframe.¬†

Users that achieve certain criteria, such as completing four exchanges totalling $20, are eligible for the airdrops.¬†

1inch is presently the tenth largest DEX, with daily trading exceeding $150 million. But we think it will only increase from here.¬†

o ¬† Reserve Rights (RSR)

Reserve Rights is developing a decentralized stablecoin to provide users with a global safe location to hold (or ""reserve"") their money.

As most of us know too well, central banks can't always be trusted in many countries. Some governments run massive deficits and print massive amounts of a new currency, undermining the purchasing power of their population in the process. Reserve Rights is seeking to address this issue.¬†

But it isn't the only issue Reserve Rights is attempting to address‚Ä¶. The team thinks that everybody in the globe should be able to conduct business with anyone else without the need for an intermediary.

The Reserve Protocol employs three types of tokens. The Reserve token (RSV) is a stablecoin with a fixed value that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. RSV is intended to be a decentralized currency that cannot be influenced or manipulated by a government or central bank.

RSV's peg is maintained by an automated stability mechanism that uses a second form of the asset-backed token as collateral to cover the total value of RSV tokens. If the price of RSV falls below $1, the protocol will buy more RSV in exchange for tokenized assets to raise the price back up. Similarly, if it exceeds $1, the system exchanges newly created RSV for tokenized assets.

The Reserve Rights token is the protocol's third type of token. Its main objective is to assist the stability of the RSV stable coin by guaranteeing its collateralization rate and peg to the U.S. dollar. In brief, the Reserve Protocol mints and sells new RSR tokens in exchange for extra collateral tokens to ensure that the whole value of the RSV token is fully covered. However, RSR is also utilized as the Reserve protocol's governance token, allowing its holders to initiate and vote on proposals.

On the Ethereum blockchain, there are approximately 50,000 RSR token holders. And that figure should rise as the Reserve Protocol expands.¬†

o ¬† RenVM (REN)¬†

The RenVM network, formerly known as the ""Republic Protocol,"" enables users to transfer wealth between networks by offering inter-blockchain liquidity. In a single transaction, users can interact with various assets and chains. The network, in fact, brings cross-chain interoperability to the world of decentralized finance (""DeFi"").¬†

The REN token is required as a bond to register and run a node on the RenVM network. On the Ethereum blockchain, there are currently around 52,000 REN holders.

For example, if a person wished to utilize their bitcoin on the Ethereum network, they would ""lock"" it inside RenVM. Ren would then transmit a ""minting signature"" for the original depositor to sign, which is normally done automatically via the protocol. The depositor then receives renBTC in their Ethereum wallet of choice, which may be sold or used in DeFi protocols as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network.¬†

RenVM has grown tremendously since its introduction last summer. On its network, it just passed $4.5 billion in cross-chain volume. Growth is also accelerating RenVM took 144 days to reach $1 billion in total chain volume‚Ä¶ 87 days to pass $2 billion‚Ä¶. 44 days to pass $3 billion‚Ä¶. and 37 days to pass $4 billion in total chain volume.¬†¬†

o ¬† Curve DAO (CRV)

The Curve is a decentralized autonomous organization (""DAO"") dedicated to facilitating liquidity between stablecoins on the Ethereum network. It intends to address price slippage and liquidity issues with previous automated stablecoin exchanges.

The Curve allows users and smart contracts to swap stablecoins like Dai (DAI) and USD Coin (USDC). Curve also enables liquidity providers (""LP"") to build pools to generate fees.

When it comes to trading between stablecoins, Curve is the go-to automated market marker (""AMM"") because it has the lowest slippage between like assets and the lowest trading fees. The CRV token's trading fees and rewards are paid to liquidity providers for Curve's pools.¬†

Curve uses the CRV coin for governance. Holders of CRV tokens can vote on proposals, and the longer they keep their CRV tokens, the more voting power they have. L.P.s for the Curve procedure is paid in CRV at a decreasing annual rate.

Curve published a whitepaper for its V2 in early June. Curve previously only facilitated trade between similar items (i.e., coins that in theory have the same intrinsic value). Curve's latest plan, however, will create a three-crypto pool comprised of WETH, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and Tether (USDT). This pool is a positive sign for Curve because it will now compete directly with Uniswap.

Curve stated in February that it had received $4 billion in deposits. This makes it one of the largest DEXs in the world. Since then, Curve has added more than $2 billion in deposits, raising its total locked value to roughly $8 billion.¬†

There are more than 35,000 CRV holders on the Ethereum blockchain alone. Curve's recent integrations with the Fantom and Polygon blockchains indicate that there is still plenty of room for expansion.¬†

o ¬† Oceans Protocol (OCEAN)

The goal of the Ocean Protocol is to ""unlock the value of data."" Users may purchase, sell, and exchange data assets safely and securely through its Ocean Market. Ocean has essentially created a decentralized exchange for data rather than money. It accomplishes this by issuing and deploying ERC-20 ""data tokens"" to represent various data assets. Users can consume these data tokens by spending them via the protocol.¬†

When a provider creates its data token, it needs to provide various parameters to mint and publish the token on Ocean's marketplace. This comprises a title, description, pricing, and a URL indicating where to find the data. When buyers are interested in a data token, they can purchase and redeem the token to receive a downloading link that goes to the required dataset ‚Äî as long as they are linked through the same wallet used to make the transaction.¬†

Consumer browsing data and listings on sites like Amazon and eBay are among the most traded assets on the Ocean Market.


The Ocean Market's native token, OCEAN, is the default token for buying and selling data tokens. People can use OCEAN to stake various data assets and vote on ideas as a governance token. The token's value is determined by its usage rate.

Currently, over 30,000 OCEAN tokens are in circulation. However, as more people interact with the market, this figure should increase.

o ¬† DAO Badger (BADGER)

Through its bitcoin-pegged token DIGG, Badger DAO aims to bring bitcoin to DeFi. DIGG auto-rebases remain loosely linked to the price of bitcoin. Badger DAO also integrated RenVM, which allows it to provide a bitcoin bridge from bitcoin to renBTC or WBTC.

Once you've bridged the gap from the Bitcoin blockchain, Badger DAO allows its users to deposit their bitcoin-pegged assets to earn interest on them through Sett Vaults, which are tokenized bitcoin vaults that deploy automated techniques across different DeFi platforms to generate yield.

The protocol provides excellent annual returns on investment (""ROI"") for storing the DIGG token in a vault and many benefits for additional deposits.

Depositing a SushiSwap-Wrapped BTC-interest-bearing BTC liquidity pair (SLP-IBBTC-WBTC) into a Badger DAO vault, for example, pays the depositor with SUSHI, BADGER, DIGG, and SushiSwap LP fees overall, the ROI amounts to a sizable 28 % to 63 % early return.

Since its inception, Badger DAO has been ""community owned."" And it intends to keep it this way through publicly available auditing reports of its smart contracts and governance voting via its native token BADGER.

As long as bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency in market capitalization, protocols like Badger DAO will be required to bridge the gap between bitcoin and DeFi. And, with over 25,000 BADGER token holders, it's evident that Badger DAO is building a sizable user base.

o ¬† Alpha Finance Lab (ALPHA)

Alpha Finance Lab is a collection of DeFi products that work together to give liquidity providers and yield farmers competitive yield rates, reduced risk, and ease.

Its main platforms for yield farming and L.P.s are divided into three categories. Alpha Homora and Alpha Homora V2 are both built on the Ethereum blockchain. The third, Alpha Homora, is based on the Binance Smart Chain. Currently, the total value frozen across all three platforms is roughly $1 billion.

L.P.s can make significant yields ranging from 30% to 300% by providing liquidity pairings to Alpha Homora products (UNI-ETH or BNB-CAKE). These liquidity pairs raise annual percentage rates (APRs) on trading fees.¬†

Participation in leveraged yield farming is also available via token pairs, which pay out additional native tokens for DeFi protocols such as Curve DAO (CRV) or SushiSwap (SUSHI). The Alpha Homora protocol automatically reinvests these tokens to enhance yield farming and trading fee APRs. Alpha's native token, ALPHA, is earned through L.P.s and yield farming on the Alpha Homora platforms.

ALPHA supports the Alpha Tokenomics product. Users can stake their ALPHA to gain incentives and unlock additional leverage on Alpha Homora products via Alpha Tokenomics. Staking 1 million or more ALPHA will get you the highest position, Alpha Pack Leader. This enables 40% more leverage on the Alpha Homora V2 platform.

There are presently roughly 6,000 ALPHA holders on Ethereum, indicating that there is still a lot of possibility for development as the Alpha Finance team continues to develop their offerings.

o ¬† Polkastarter (POLS)

Polkastarter is a decentralized cross-chain system that uses token pools and auctions to help new projects obtain funds and establish a community.

Polkastarter is based on Polkadot, a platform that prioritizes security, scalability, and interoperability.

What truly distinguishes Polkastarter is the team's thoroughness and study into each project posted on the marketplace.

Thousands of DeFi projects, for example, are launched with no thought or forethought. This can swiftly lead to the demise of projects. Polkastarter also provides fixed ratio swaps, limiting the amount an individual investor can deposit while encouraging token distribution.


POLS is Polkastarter's native governance token. It is in charge of whitelisting investors and allowing them to buy tokens for an initial decentralized sale. The token is available on Ethereum as well as Binance Smart Chain.

This procedure is governed by a ticketing system in which every 250 POLS equals one ticket that is whitelisted at random. The more tickets you have, the more likely you are to participate.¬†

Another approach to obtain tickets is to provide liquidity to the Uniswap ETH-POLS or PancakeSwap BNB-POLS pools. Each L.P. token is worth 100 POLS. So, five L.P. tokens are worth 500 POLS, or two tickets.

On the Ethereum blockchain alone, there are over 40,000 POLS token holders, with approximately 3,500 holders on the Binance Smart Chain. Polkastarter has successfully launched over 100 projects through its token pool method since late 2020, with many more on the way.

o ¬† Wrapped MIR(WMIR)

Wrapped MIR is a Mirror Protocol (MIR) token ""wrapped"" in an Ethereum smart contract.

The MIR token, you see, is inherent to the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem. The token can be traded on the Ethereum blockchain and exchanges such as 1inch and Uniswap by wrapping it.

Mirror Protocol monitors the prices of stocks, futures, ETFs, and other traditional financial assets. Then it allows users to create synthetic assets known as Mirrored Assets (""mAssets""), which ""mirror"" the price behaviour of real-world assets by reflecting exchange prices on-chain. Mirror Protocol was the first to do this.

Mirror's mission is to provide investment opportunities to people who have been excluded from global financial systems. Anyone can use Mirror to invest in synthetic assets that mirror the top U.S. stocks.

Anyone holding MIR tokens ‚Äì the Mirror Protocol's governance token ‚Äì can introduce new assets beyond the first 12 synthetics tracking the most prominent U.S. technology equities. The idea is then presented to a vote, and if approved by the DAO, the new asset is added.

Mirror's goal of generating synthetic assets for global buyers could become one of the most significant prospects in crypto, in our opinion.

On the Ethereum blockchain, there are now roughly 24,000 WMIR holders.¬†

Because ownership of the token determines whether you may utilize Mirror, the token's value will climb as the world finds its power.

o ¬† Rari Governance Token (RGT)

RGT is DAO Rari Capital's governance token.


Rari Capital is an internet service that helps those who desire to build their fortune with DeFi. It enables individuals to obtain safe yields on dependable investments while assuming less risk.

Rari grew to offer leveraged yield-farming techniques after its first launch, and it now allows investors of any risk level to access yield-earning options.

Rari maximizes returns from asset pools, such as stable assets and lending or farming, using multiple DeFi protocols such as Compound and Aave. RGT is used to vote on or create ideas submitted by other token-holding community members.¬†

Token holders will be able to delegate their voting power to another address in the future to pool voting power. The governance system governs every aspect of Rari Capital, including token buybacks and burns, which can boost token value by reducing supply.

RGT is remarkable for its so-called ""fair launch,"" The DAO elected not to sell any tokens at its first public offering. Instead, its distributed tokens to liquidity miners who backed the protocol and the founding team.

Plans for Rari include cross-chain bridges, which could help Rari reach its ultimate objective of attracting all of DeFi's liquidity (now $58 billion). This is a lofty aim, but we feel Rari can achieve it swiftly. On the Ethereum blockchain, there are presently roughly 10,000 RGT holders.



Acquiring DEGEN

DEGEN tokens can be achieved in two ways: by purchasing them on an exchange or by minting them from the underlying assets.

When you mint DEGEN tokens, you use a smart contract to exchange one or more tokens for a freshly generated DEGEN token. Please keep in mind that you will receive a percentage of DEGEN dependent on the token you mint (not a one-to-one swap). As a result, the overall supply of DEGEN is not fixed.

Please remember that every option for purchasing or minting the tokens will include fees, with some as high as 2% to 5%. When you close the position, you'll have to pay extra fees. We're paying for the convenience of entering or exiting the portfolio.


Tokens can be produced in three ways:


1. Indexed Finance mints single coins.

You can easily produce DEGEN tokens if you own (or intend to buy and then mint) one of the index's component coins. Remember that this will incur ETH gas expenses and a fee to the Indexed Finance smart contract, which is typically approximately 2%. Make sure, at the end; you have some ETH in your wallet to cover the amount.


Keep in mind that the pool is constantly rebalancing, and if the coin you're minting happens to be overweighed in the pool at the time, you may receive a little lesser quantity of DEGEN coins for your money.

2. Indexed finance's multi-coin minting

You can utilize more than one of the index's component coins to create DEGEN tokens when you have more than one of the index's component coins. Please keep in mind that this will incur ETH gas charges and the smart contract fee, which is typically approximately 2%. Well, make sure that you have some ETH in your wallet to cover the amount.

Be mindful that the pool is constantly rebalancing, and if the coins you're minting happen to be overweighed in the pool at the time, you may earn a little lesser number of DEGEN coins than you would have otherwise.

3. Indexed Finance Router Minting

If you have ETH, DAI, or USDC, you can use the mint tab to pick ""Router."" This smart contract routes to SushiSwap and Uniswap to ensure you get the greatest pricing. This will have ETH gas fees, exchange fees, and indexing fees, which will be roughly 2% to 3%. As a result, you must have some ETH in your wallet to cover the amount.

Purchasing DEGEN

¬†DEGEN tokens can be purchased in four locations:

1. from Indexed Finance


If you have ETH, DAI, or USDC, you can purchase DEGEN through Indexed Finance. It should be noted that there will be ETH gas fees, perhaps slippage fees, and indexing fees of up to 2%. As a consequence, confirm that you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fee.¬†

2. From Uniswap

Uniswap allows you to exchange any ERC-20 token for DEGEN. WETH is the most liquid token, although any token swappable on Uniswap will work. Remember that ETH gas fees and slippage will apply. As a consequence, confirm that you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fee.¬†

¬†3. From SushiSwap

This is a WETH- DEGEN pool, similar to Uniswap. It is brand new and has low liquidity, but we anticipate that it will expand over time. The Indexed team will be transferring the Uniswap liquidity here in the following weeks. Remember that ETH gas fees and slippage will apply. As a consequence, confirm that you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fee.¬†

4. Using QuickSwap

DEGEN token holders have connected their tokens to the Polygon (MATIC) network, allowing you can purchase them directly on the native QuickSwap exchange. While the costs will be low, you may have to pay a big market premium for your tokens if liquidity is limited.

Should You Mint or Purchase DEGEN?

Even with the 2% cost, most investors benefit better by minting tokens because buying the tokens frequently results in significant premiums and slippage.¬†

If you buy DEGEN on an exchange by exchanging it for another cryptocurrency, such as DAI, USDC, or ETH, the exchange may value DEGEN higher than its net asset value (""NAV"").¬†

As a result, you may pay a premium for DEGEN and receive less than what you paid for.

DEGEN's NAV may be found in the upper right corner of the chart (updated hourly):

¬†How High Could DEGEN Go?

We expect a 1,000% return on DEGEN tokens in 12 to 24 months.

As more individuals become aware of DeFi and the technology develops, hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested. The potential returns are simply too high. Crypto, particularly DeFi, used to be a career danger if an institution owned it... eventually, not holding it will be a career risk.

DeFi projects currently account for 4.9 % of the bitcoin market. Meanwhile, financials account for approximately 10% of the S&P 500's market capitalization. While it is impossible to directly compare cryptos to stocks, it is evident that DeFi should continue to expand.¬†

And each of DEGEN's projects is only getting started.

The average market capitalization of DEGEN's various components is less than $350 million. However, the average market cap of the top 20 DeFi coins is currently more than ten times that amount. That doesn't guarantee us any gains, but it demonstrates how far these tokens can go when they get the market's attention.¬†

We feel that each of these cryptocurrencies has the potential to become one of the top 20 projects in the world.

As previously stated, DEGEN assigns a weighting objective to each index component based on the square root of the market capitalization.

While this may be an unneeded complication, it is a wonderful touch when dealing with highly volatile stocks. Because of the nature of square roots, the greater a cryptocurrency's market cap, the less influential it becomes in the portfolio because of the square roots' nature.

Consider two cryptocurrencies... ABCD has a market capitalization of $4, whereas EFGH has a market capitalization of $100.

The square root of four dollars is two dollars, and the square root of one hundred dollars is ten dollars. Even while EFGH is 25 times larger than ABCD in real life, its target weighting in the ""square root"" portfolio is just five times greater.


As a result, smaller market capitalizations can have a greater impact on the portfolio. And, as the value of a token rises, the intelligent passive index reduces the portfolio's effective size. Meanwhile, if the value of a token falls, its weighting should rise accordingly to the larger tokens. Essentially, the index profits on winners automatically buy the dip on underperformers. That is why we wish to acquire DEGEN tokens."
