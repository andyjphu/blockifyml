Top 5 Ideas for Hosting a Princess Party in Tampa,u_erepresent,1i9uo5w,2025-01-25 14:21:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9uo5w/top_5_ideas_for_hosting_a_princess_party_in_tampa/,erepresent,,"Hosting a princess-themed party is a magical way to celebrate your child‚Äôs special day. In a beautiful city like Tampa, the options for creating an enchanting event are endless, thanks to its stunning venues, vibrant community, and sunny weather. Whether you‚Äôre planning an indoor or outdoor event, the right theme and activities can transform your celebration into a fairy-tale experience. To help you plan, here are the top five ideas for hosting a Tampa princess party that will make your child feel like royalty.

# 1. Transform Your Venue into a Royal Castle

One of the best ways to bring the magic of a princess party to life is by turning your venue into a regal castle. With some creativity and attention to detail, you can set the stage for an unforgettable celebration.

* **Decor:** Use pastel-colored balloons, shimmering curtains, and fairy lights to create a whimsical atmosphere. Add castle-shaped banners, royal thrones, and princess-themed table settings to enhance the theme.
* **Photo Backdrop:** Create a photo booth area with a castle backdrop, props like crowns and wands, and twinkling fairy lights for stunning pictures.
* **DIY Ideas:** Incorporate simple DIY projects, such as crafting paper crowns for the tables or decorating chairs with sparkly ribbons.

Whether you‚Äôre hosting the party at home or at a rented venue, the royal castle theme is guaranteed to captivate your guests.

# 2. Host a Garden Tea Party

Tampa‚Äôs sunny weather makes an outdoor princess tea party a fantastic choice. This idea combines elegance with fun, giving kids the chance to enjoy a royal afternoon in a beautiful garden setting.

* **Decor:** Arrange tables with lace tablecloths, floral centerpieces, and vintage tea sets. Add pastel umbrellas or canopies for shade and a touch of sophistication.
* **Activities:** Include crown decorating or flower crafting as pre-tea activities. Let the kids enjoy a ‚Äúroyal tea tasting‚Äù with pink lemonade or juice served in tea cups.
* **Menu:** Serve finger sandwiches, mini cupcakes, and cookies shaped like tiaras and stars.

This idea works wonderfully in Tampa‚Äôs parks or even your own backyard, creating a charming and memorable event.

# 3. Plan an Enchanted Under-the-Sea Adventure

If your child loves mermaids and ocean-themed adventures, an under-the-sea princess party is the perfect option. Tampa‚Äôs proximity to water makes this theme even more fitting.

* **Decor:** Use shades of blue, teal, and purple with touches of shimmering silver. Add seashells, starfish, and netting to create an underwater effect.
* **Activities:** Organize a treasure hunt for ‚Äúpearls‚Äù and ‚Äúgold coins,‚Äù set up a bubble-blowing station, or host a mermaid sing-along.
* **Menu:** Offer snacks like fish-shaped sandwiches, ‚Äúseaweed‚Äù veggie sticks, and ocean-themed cupcakes.

Whether you host the event poolside or at a waterfront venue, an under-the-sea theme is sure to make a splash.

# 4. Create a Winter Wonderland Princess Party

Bring the magic of a snow queen to sunny Tampa by hosting a winter wonderland princess party. This frosty theme is perfect for kids who love all things icy and magical.

* **Decor:** Use icy blues, whites, and silvers for your color palette. Add snowflake cutouts, faux snow, and silver garlands to create a wintery atmosphere.
* **Activities:** Kids can decorate snowflake ornaments, enjoy a ‚Äúsnowball toss‚Äù game with white beanbags, or sing along to their favorite snow queen songs.
* **Menu:** Serve marshmallow ‚Äúsnowballs,‚Äù frosted cookies, and hot chocolate with whipped cream.

This theme works well for indoor parties or air-conditioned venues, offering a cool escape from Tampa‚Äôs warm climate.

# 5. Host a Princess-Inspired Dance Party

For a lively celebration full of movement and music, a royal dance party is an excellent choice. Kids can channel their inner princess while twirling and dancing the day away.

* **Decor:** Turn your venue into a royal ballroom with elegant drapes, chandeliers, and a dance floor. Hang a disco ball for extra sparkle.
* **Activities:** Hire a princess performer to teach the kids simple ballroom dance moves. Add a freeze dance game with princess-themed music for extra fun.
* **Entertainment:** Play classic princess movie songs or hire a DJ to keep the energy high.

A dance party is perfect for kids who love to move and is guaranteed to have everyone smiling from ear to ear.

# Tips for Enhancing Your Princess Party

No matter which theme you choose, there are a few additional touches that can make your Tampa princess party even more magical:

* **Hire a Professional Princess Performer:** A professional princess can lead activities, sing songs, and create a truly immersive experience for your child and their guests.
* **Capture the Memories:** Set up a dedicated photo area and take plenty of pictures to remember the special day. Consider hiring a photographer for high-quality photos.
* **Send Guests Home with Favors:** Party favors like mini crowns, wands, or princess-themed goodies make for great takeaways.

# Final Thoughts

Hosting a Tampa princess party is a wonderful way to create cherished memories for your child and their friends. Whether you‚Äôre planning a royal ball, a garden tea party, or an under-the-sea adventure, Tampa‚Äôs versatility and charm provide the perfect setting for a magical celebration.

By combining thoughtful details, engaging activities, and a touch of creativity, your party is sure to be a hit. Let your little one‚Äôs fairy-tale dreams come to life with an unforgettable **Tampa princess party** that will leave everyone smiling."

A bit iffy on the coherence and a little rambly, but I'm trying to commit to a weekly schedule. Thus, it's time to Just Post.

**Evening**  
**Transgracian Academy of Magical Arts, Dining Hall Kitchens**  
**Cadet Emma Booker**

I once again found myself heading down to the kitchens, this time bypassing the domain of the snooty Executive Chef and heading straight for the lower kitchens, where Chef Keiran and his brigade of gremlins worked. It had been a couple days since I first met them to solve my food sourcing issues, which they had sorted out with a refreshing directness that I had sorely missed in the Nexus. So far, I‚Äôd been sitting pretty, almost pampered even, by the steady supply of top-notch homestyle cooking coming from the kitchens. Sure, it wasn‚Äôt as haute cuisine as the regular dining hall menu, but it was good, hearty fare all the same.

The change in circumstances got me thinking, though. How long until I started craving a taste of home? Which then led to me thinking, why wait for the homesickness to set in, and proactively indulge myself instead? I was already bombarded with incredibly annoying amounts of Nexian ‚Äòhospitality‚Äô on a daily basis, so a little comfort food shouldn‚Äôt be too much to ask for the sake of my mental health. Building and maintaining morale was critical to mission stability, after all.

Which is why I was paying another visit to Keiran‚Äôs merry band. Pushing through the doors of the lower kitchens, that familiar wall of noise hit me immediately. As usual for this time of night, the brigade was doing prep work for the following day, making sure that the upper kitchens had the raw materials on hand to work their culinary magic. I was familiar enough with them now that I didn‚Äôt need the HUD to put names to faces.

Closest to me were Stitch and Sooty. Both of them were similarly tall and lanky, but carried themselves differently. Stitch was the severe-looking, buttoned up one, carrying out his role as Keiran‚Äôs sous chef with professionalism. Sooty was far more laid back, with a slack posture, and clothes that seemed to fluctuate between being one or two sizes too large for him. Goose and Boots were on the opposite side of the bench, Goose‚Äôs large, stocky frame contrasting with Boots‚Äô short and wiry build.

Stitch noticed me first, and called out, ‚ÄúHullo, Cadet Booker, good seeing you again! Chef‚Äôs out for a bit, but he should be back soon.‚Äù He gestured to an array of animated copper and steel utensils making short work of mountains of meat, vegetables, and herbs.¬†  
‚ÄúSorry about the wait, but we‚Äôve got to knock out the prep work for tomorrow. The automatics do a fair job, but they need minding,‚Äù he explained. Near each group of ‚Äòautomatics‚Äô was one of Keiran‚Äôs crew, keeping an eye on the processes while portioning and storing the end products into jars and ramekins, reminding me of Sorecar‚Äôs manufactorium tour. Funnily enough, the ‚Äòautomatics‚Äô seemed to be moving in time with the music, just like how I was low key rocking out to the [raucous song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrkuo0y8gMU). This time I could make out the lyrics as the vocalist shout-sang the lyrics, his voice ten thousand cigarettes.

*Delving in the caverns,*  
*Seek the glint of gold!*  
*You can catch me resting,*  
*When I‚Äôm dead and cold!*

*‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm*  
*SIX FURLONGS UNDERGROUND*  
*SIX FURLONGS UNDERGROUND*

*I‚Äôm going*  
*SIX FURLONGS UNDERGROUND*  
*SIX FURLONGS UNDERGROUND*

A grin spread across Sooty‚Äôs face as he took notice. ‚ÄúHaha, got your head bobbing, eh?‚Äù He pointed his thumb at the source of the music, a rickety looking device that looked like a three-way collision between a phonograph, a tacky lampshade, and a lava lamp. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre called Throat Punch! Brilliant, yeah?‚Äù  
Apparently my enjoyment of the music was noticeable even through the exosuit. I nodded my head enthusiastically, replying, ‚ÄúYeah man, this is good stuff! Throat Punch, huh?‚Äù  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got loads of songs about adventuring, finding loot, cracking skulls. Perfect to listen to when yer knocking out donkey work like this,‚Äù explained Sooty with the vigor of a die-hard fan. Oh yeah, this guy‚Äôs wardrobe was definitely 75% band shirts. I made a note in my journal to get music recs from Sooty, if only to scandalize and horrify Ilunor.

The main doors opened behind me, revealing Chef Keiran returning from his meeting. ‚ÄúAh, Cadet Booker, always a pleasure,‚Äù he said with a genuine smile. ‚ÄúAll is well with the meals we‚Äôve been preparing, I trust? Any issues to report, or room for improvement?‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh no, everything‚Äôs been top notch, Chef,‚Äù I replied, giving him a big thumbs up. ‚ÄúThe stuff from the taverns was good, but the stuff you guys make is outstanding!‚Äù  
‚ÄúGlad to hear it, but if everything is satisfactory, what brings you here?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAh, right. Well, the stuff you‚Äôve been serving up really has been great, but lately I‚Äôve gotten a hankering for some real Earthrealm food.‚Äù  
Keiran nodded in understanding. ‚ÄúFeeling a touch homesick? Not to worry, our students hail from Realms far and wide, and we‚Äôve been able to satisfy their cravings no matter how exotic. Consider the challenge accepted! Now, what is it you need prepared?‚Äù

While talking, we strolled over to the large table in the middle of the kitchen that served as a makeshift meeting area for the brigade. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a couple of dishes that I had in mind, but I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve got a point of reference for them,‚Äù I began. Fundamental Systemic Incongruence permeated every aspect of inter-realm diplomacy, so was it any surprise that ideas and standards of food preparation fell under that umbrella? Wanting to get ahead of any potential crossed wires, I enacted my ‚Äòcultural exchange‚Äô plan.

I started taking out the materials I‚Äôd prepped for this meeting, laying them out on the table while Keiran and his crew watched with interest. First came the nutripaste tubes, about six of each flavor provided by the LREF. ‚ÄúSo I thought, why not give you guys a point of reference for Earthrealm food, or at least the flavors? They don‚Äôt taste exactly like the real deal, but close enough. I figured it would be better than going in blind and doing things by trial and error,‚Äù I explained as the stack of paste tubes grew. Now that I‚Äôd secured a stable source of food, I could afford to ‚Äòburn‚Äô some of my rations on side projects like this.¬†

I had also brought samples of *nam prik pao*, the ‚Äòmulti-tool‚Äô of Thai cuisine, and *nam pla*, Thai fish sauce. They were non-negotiable condiments for me, thanks to growing up on a steady diet of Auntie Ran‚Äôs cooking, which meant a jumbo portion of each in my personal effects. ‚ÄúThese are a selection of the rations that I was supplied with, one of each type of flavor, plus my preferred condiments.‚Äù  
Chef Keiran regarded the tubes and vials arrayed before him, and whistled in appreciation. ‚ÄúWell, your quartermaster didn‚Äôt leave you wanting for variety, did they?‚Äù he mused, examining one of the tubes. The others drew close to have a look as well.  
‚ÄúStill, pastes for rations? Seems a bit odd, but if it works, it works,‚Äù said Goose, peering closely at another tube.¬†  
‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt be worse than those ration bricks we had to choke down in the Navy, at any rate,‚Äù chimed in Boots, who seemed to be more interested in the tubes than their contents.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve also got illustrated recipes for ration, or at least the dishes that they‚Äôre supposed to be,‚Äù I added, taking out a small stack of printed docs. 

Putting together illustrated recipes for Terran food was surprisingly difficult when you had the added limitation of not including humans or human hands in the pictures. Luckily I had a military-grade VI to help me doctor the images when needed. Keiran raised an eyebrow at the stack of docs, chuckling. ‚ÄúYou Earthrealmers are a diligent lot, aren‚Äôt you? My thanks in advance for being so thorough. This will likely save me and the lads a fair bit of time,‚Äù he remarked, taking the documents with a smile.¬†  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad it helps. So yeah, I figured you guys can try out these rations and maybe try making the real deal with local ingredients. Does that sound fair?‚Äù‚ÄúAye, no trouble. Besides, it‚Äôs good for the lads to chew on riddles every now and then, it keeps the mind sharp,‚Äù Keiran explained. Retrieving a wooden box from a shelf behind him, he continued, ‚ÄúOn top of that, we‚Äôve got a Sense Recorder on hand, so if all else fails, we can turn to the housekeeping archive,‚Äù he added.  
That got an eyebrow raise from me. ‚ÄúSense Recorder? Housekeeping archive?‚Äù I asked with the now routine sideways tilt of my helmet.  
‚ÄúOh right, that sort of artifice is probably a bit advanced for newrealmers,‚Äù replied Keiran. He scratched his chin in thought before elaborating further, ‚ÄúSense Recorders are special helms that, well, record particular sensations felt by the wearer. The one we have is specifically keyed to taste, of course. The spellwork for it is far beyond my ken, but using it is a simple enough affair. Put it on, eat the food of interest, taking your time to savor the taste properly. As you taste things, all of it gets recorded on the memory crystal slotted in the helm.‚Äù  
‚ÄúHuh, and what happens after you make the recording?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAfter we‚Äôre done recording, we pop out the crystal and send it up to the housekeeping offices, and they do whatever they do to identify and catalogue the flavors. You can imagine that the Academy has built up quite the library over the centuries. We‚Äôve probably got the taste of just about any ingredient or dish you‚Äôd care to name,‚Äù he explained with a chuckle.  
‚ÄúAlso, the Culinarian‚Äôs Guild has a bounty on novel flavors and dishes. Every now and then we pocket a nice bit of coin for the odd discovery,‚Äù chimed in Boots, who seemed to always have a side hustle going on.

Once again, I was hit with whiplash. The high fantasy trappings of Keiran‚Äôs magical items was in stark contrast to the decidedly sci-fi elements of this Housekeeping Archive he was talking about. A database of flavor profiles that could be queried to reverse engineer recipes sounded like some niche hypernet service, ripped from the What‚Äôs Hot section of Futurism Today. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty neat! Can the archive figure out whole recipes by cross-checking all the flavors in a dish?‚Äù I asked, which made Keiran and the crew laugh.  
‚ÄúAye, they‚Äôve got spellwork that can do that. Or at least, it TRIES to have a go at guessing recipes, but they‚Äôre rubbish at best and utter swill at worst! What me and the lads usually do is get the ingredient list it spits out, then try to suss out the recipe from that. But sometimes the havoc it claims to be a recipe is good for a laugh.‚Äù  
‚ÄúHeh, I guess it‚Äôs a case of Artificial Intelligence being more like Natural Stupidity, huh?‚Äù  
Another belly laugh from Keiran. ‚ÄúHah! You Earthrealmers can turn a phrase, that‚Äôs for sure! Well, if that‚Äôs all, I suppose we can get into it then?‚Äù  
‚ÄúSure, go ahead. Don‚Äôt go too overboard though, I do have a lot, but it‚Äôs still a limited supply,‚Äù I replied, and the whole kitchen crew nodded in response. They tentatively unscrewed the tubes, and after some instruction on how to pierce the protective foil, began sniffing and tasting the contents.¬†  
‚ÄúHang on‚Ä¶ this is‚Ä¶‚Äù muttered Stitch to himself, holding the vial of *nam pla* up to the light.  
‚ÄúWhat you got there, Stitch?‚Äù asked Goose, also curious about the man‚Äôs reaction to the fish sauce.  
‚Äú*Garum piscatus aureus*, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got!‚Äù exclaimed Stitch.  
‚ÄúGold grade, seriously? From a newrealm?‚Äù replied Boots, an incredulous look on his face.  
‚ÄúAye, the nose on it is unmistakable, and the clarity is excellent,‚Äù explained Stitch. He tipped a drop of the fish sauce onto his palm and tasted it. ‚ÄúThat is absolutely *garum piscatus*,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúIt would get silver on the clarity alone, the aroma and taste get a gold from me, but that could be argued,‚Äù he elaborated, before turning to me.¬†  
‚ÄúCadet Booker, I can definitely get a hold of something similar to this. Hells, I might even try my hand at brewing a fresh batch of it,‚Äù he said with a confident grin.  
‚ÄúOh bugger off, you just want an excuse to set up one of your alchemical experiments in the larder,‚Äù declared Goose with a scowl. ‚ÄúTry not to kill us with the stink if you do, all right mate?‚Äù  
‚ÄúBarbarians,‚Äù muttered Stitch, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúNo appreciation of the subtle art of fermentation.‚Äù

Stitch‚Äôs grumbling blended in with the rest of the crew‚Äôs chatting, which grew increasingly rowdier as they tasted more nutripaste tubes. Finally, Keiran silenced them with a loud and sharp whistle. After they quieted down, Keiran instructed them, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre excited about getting first tries at newrealm‚Äôs grub, but be a bit more orderly about it. You heard the Cadet, this stuff doesn‚Äôt grow on trees. Slow and steady, don‚Äôt be wasteful. Make sure to take notes, and use the Sense Recorder, too!‚Äù

With some direction from Keiran, his crew conducted themselves like a well oiled machine, tasting a measure of nutripaste while poring over the corresponding recipe card, excitedly scribbling notes in the margins and their personal notebooks. As I watched them work, it became clear to me they were skilled professionals, but they had the misfortune of being of low birth and lacking in mana proficiency. Too coarse to be let near the higher ups, but too valuable to cast aside. Making small talk with Keiran confirmed this. It turns out most of the staff had served in the Nexian Interrealm Navy in something called the Aquarion Campaign. The kitchen crew was literally Keiran‚Äôs crew in a sense, although he had been a Quartermaster rather than Captain. Still, it was an officer‚Äôs rank, enough to let him claw his way into the Academy kitchens. He wasted no time giving his men a hand up the ladder.

The group had decided to sort the ‚Äòtasting menu‚Äô based on similarity to mainstream Nexian cuisine, basically the stuff they regularly served in the dining halls. As I expected, what we‚Äôd call ‚Äòwestern cuisine‚Äô back home hewed close to what the Nexians were accustomed to. Shredded BBQ Beef, Braised Lamb Shanks, Salmon Pesto, Meatball Marinara, these all fell into that category. Teriyaki Chicken served as a kind of midpoint between Nexian cuisine‚Äôs European trappings and the more Asian bent that the rest of the nutripaste flavors took.

The Asian side of the ‚Äòtasting menu‚Äô really got the crew worked up, especially the Nasi Lemak‚Äôs *sambal* kick, the sweet-hot tingle of the *Pad Krapow Gai*, and the tangy savoriness of the Chicken Adobo. They were very interested to know why there was such a stark difference in flavor profile. As I explained how varied and distinct Earth‚Äôs many cuisines could be, I noticed them exchanging odd looks. The directional mic picked up snatches of conversation in a language that wasn‚Äôt in EVI‚Äôs databases. The conversation quickly escalated into bickering, still in Not-Nexian, as the cooks argued while pointing at the ration tubes, the recipes, and even the recipe booklets and their spiral bindings.

A sharp look from Keiran and some stern words in that same language brought things to a halt. He turned to address me directly, and cleared his throat. ‚ÄúTruth be told, we‚Äôre all a bit‚Ä¶ curious about the particulars of Earthrealm. A lot of what you‚Äôve shared with us has been‚Ä¶ unexpected, let‚Äôs say,‚Äù he stated in a diplomatic tone of voice, professional mask fully affixed. ‚ÄúPerhaps we can pursue those questions at a more appropriate time?‚Äù he added, the question directed more at the brigade than at me.  
‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù said Sooty with a shrug. Everybody else muttered a grudging agreement. ‚ÄúRight, getting back to the food then‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúAll in all, everything‚Äôs quite decent, I‚Äôd say,‚Äù ventured Goose.  
‚ÄúRight, but the texture, or lack thereof, is complete \[trough wash\]. No offense to your quartermaster, Cadet Booker,‚Äù countered Sooty.  
‚ÄúNone taken. Imagine how I felt chowing down on that sludge for a week or two,‚Äù I replied. The brigade winced sympathetically.  
‚ÄúTexture is something we can definitely fix, though. Look at this ‚Äòadobo‚Äô stuff, for instance,‚Äù commented Keiran, pointing at the recipe for Chicken Adobo. The paste tastes good already, but if you look at the pictures, it‚Äôs supposed to be stewed fowl of some sort. Reckon it‚Äôd be quite lovely, done up with a proper bird, like a \[town crier\] or \[reed skimmer\].‚Äù  
‚ÄúAye Chef, we can probably get within spitting distance of most of this lot with the spice on hand,‚Äù agreed Stitch, gesturing to the ‚ÄòNexian-like‚Äô pile. ‚ÄúThese ones though, from the Eastern kingdoms, is it? These will need some puzzling out, but I think there‚Äôs a great deal of potential.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs potential all right, potential to make a tidy sum. The Guild ought to transfer that bounty to our coffers right now. Erm, with your permission of course, Cadet Booker,‚Äù said Boots, referring to the ‚Äònovel tastes‚Äô bounty he mentioned earlier.  
‚ÄúSure, just as long as I get my cut,‚Äù I shot back, much to the amusement of the crew, Boots included.   
‚ÄúFair deal, Cadet Booker. I say we commemorate this occasion with a cheeky smoke. How about it, Chef? We‚Äôre almost done with the upstairs restock, and we‚Äôve got a fresh set of mana pots coming in the loading bay. Good way to kill time while we wait, eh?‚Äù  
‚ÄúFine, but before you go, finish up properly and tidy up your stations. I‚Äôll join you in a bit.‚Äù

I followed the crew to what looked like a medieval loading dock, where they gathered in a circle and began to light up, initiating the sacred blue-collar ritual that was the smoke break. Pipes, cigarillos, even skinny black cigarettes that reminded me of Indonesian *keretek*, almost everyone had their own way of getting their nicotine fix. At least, I assumed nicotine was the active substance.¬†

Sooty in particular was enjoying the hell out of his smoke, a hand rolled number filled to bursting with a generous pinch of leaf. The way Sooty took a drag off that thing, you'd think it tasted like steak and lobster tail. Not a single molecule of that smoke went to waste as he held it for a moment, then exhaled. ""Ah, nothing like \[burning a bush\] after a slog of a shift.‚Äù  
""You‚Äôre more of a forest fire, you madman. I swear, you use half a bag when you roll those fat bastards.""  
‚ÄúBold flavor requires bold action, boys. Life‚Äôs too short to act like a dried prick.‚Äù  
""If you're burning leaves by the fistful, you ought to use a pipe like ol' Chef there,"" Goose chimed in, gesturing to Keiran, who had just arrived.  
""Aye, Chef's a man of refinement he is. Plus, there's loads of other things you can smoke in a pipe,"" he commented, earning knowing chuckles from the rest of the crew.  
""Very funny, you scallywags. Just remember, what you smoke on your own time is your own business, trusting that you aren't a moron about it. But if I catch any of you on shift with a head full of \[dream herb\], I'll have your hide,"" grumbled Keiran as he lit his pipe. ""The highborns in the towers might not give a tinker's cuss about us gruel-stirrers, but you all know there's a limit to the foolishness they'll ignore. Got it?""  
The crew droned in chorus, ""Aye Cap'n,"" while mock saluting, earning more grumbling from Keiran as he puffed away on his pipe.  
""What about you, Cadet? Ever had a go with \[dream herb\], pinch of \[slack weed\]? Oh, right, can't smoke with all that clanking bedlam you've got on. Probably would sieve the smoke out of the air even if you could.""  
""Well, she could always eat it...""  
""Haha, too right! How long has it been since we've baked a Halfwit's Tart, lads?""  
""Not long enough, that's for sure. Bloody wasteful compared to just smokin' the stuff.""  
""S'only wasteful if you over-boil the treacle and scorch the herb.""  
""Yeah, but if you UNDER-boil it, the bitters don't cook off and it tastes like a clod of dirt.""  
""Bugger off with that, you fancy lad. Since when has anyone eaten Halfwit Tart for the taste?""  
""That right there is why it should be called Bollocks Pie. Tastes like shite and takes half of forever to kick in. I'd sooner mess about with hot knives...""  
""Oh but when it kicks in, s'like you're smokin' the whole bleedin' bag at once!""

I let the profound silliness of the situation sink in. Hanging out on smoke break with a bunch of dirtbag line cook aliens, engaged in a spirited debate on the best way to get high on fantasy weed.

At the same time, it was reassuring. The Nexus loved projecting the totalitarian nature of their influence. How everyone was an obedient cog in this vast, divine machine of theirs. But in human history at least, claims of that sort were always bullshit. No matter how mighty and powerful you made yourself out to be, no matter how strong a chokehold you had on hearts and minds, there would always be little forgotten corners like this, where people sneak a few moments of respite to have a smoke and speak their mind.

A soft chime brought me out of my musings, followed by a timed reminder from the EVI. ‚ÄúCadet Booker, this is a reminder that you still have 4 outstanding items on the ‚Äòto do‚Äô list for today. Your next scheduled meeting will be in 30 minutes.‚Äù I sighed, looking around at Keiran and his crew shooting the shit before the next rush. Any remaining feelings of urgency left my mind as I enjoyed being in the moment.

I gave the EVI my firm reply. ‚ÄúEVI, I‚Äôm on smoko, so leave me alone.‚Äù"

If this post is more than 48 hours old please do not reply to it, it might be outdated and I might no longer be looking for games in the title, please look for the most recent post instead.

I'VE BEEN SUBSCRIBED TO HUMBLE CHOICE FOR OVER 2 YEARS, ANY COMMENTS ASKING ""anything here (mostly choice games from the past few months or fanatical mystery trash) for this game"" WILL BE IGNORED

Primarily looking for the games in the title, if you post a list without the games from the title I want chances of me finding something I'm willing to trade for is low.

If you're not from EU I will only sell if you cover the paypal fees and pay in EUR instead of your native currency. I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC PRICE IN MIND, THE PRICE DEPENDS ON GREY MARKET PRICING BUT I'M OPEN TO OFFERS. Aside from games listed in the title I'm not very interested in offers for new games atm, even wishlisted ones

DO NOT send me a chat invite before having agreed on a trade in the comments. I do not check chat often and it's a rule to not send a chat invite before commenting anyway.

Help me find a Power metal album cover. Please!,MetalForTheMasses,1i9tnp9,2025-01-25 13:38:04,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetalForTheMasses/comments/1i9tnp9/help_me_find_a_power_metal_album_cover_please/,Tromocraut1917,,"Alright so here is the deal. I asked about everywhere. I remember seeing and listening to a power metal album last year alright, but i cant remember the name just the cover art (vaguely i think). Alright, so it had a viking warship sailing in a sea filled with ice chunks floating. The art work was very similar in bright pastel colors and style to early Heavy Load and looked very much as it was hand drawn on paper. The name of the band and the name of the album were on the top left corner and i think they had a gold letters font (not sure on that one) It also kinda reminded me of Windir's Arntor with its style but a bit more saturated colors?! I had checked the band on metallum back then, so i know its there. Last the name of this album was something along the line of ""Tale from the Adventures at the Northern Seas"" or ""Adventures at the North Winds""?. Also if i remember correctly this album was released in the late 80s early 90s. If it helps i remember that the band switched to thrash at some point with an album that had a skull wearing a green beret with a knife in its teeth titled ""USA Death Squads"" or ""I need you to die!"" i could be wrong about the title though, but the skull with the knife is 100% correct. Last there was definitely a title track (dont know if that helps) and a song about Riders at Valhalla, Riding to Valhalla? (cliche i know)

Sorry for this post being all over the place it just been so long and i gave only a few listens to the album. Thanks in advance mates. "

***
> In the coastal city of **[Neverwinter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ooWG7JvAYVgmxZbx28VnSmDV2lYs2WLZ/view?usp=sharing)**, an up-and-coming dwarf merchant and entrepreneur named **[Gundren Rockseeker](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5BnuFzkhSqxWkZSQ2tuZjJGbWs/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-gX0BOTKURKW4bFfPf448lw)** has hired you, a party of rookie adventurers, to bring a wagon-load of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of **Phandalin**, roughly a few days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was barely able to conceal his own excitement but remained secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found ""something big,"" and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for safely escorting his supplies to **Barthen's Provisions**, the trading post in Phandalin. He then set out on horseback, a few days' ride ahead of you, alongside a hired warrior escort named **Sildar Hallwinter**. You recall Gundren gruffly stating that he would need to arrive early, in order to, ""take care of some minor business.""

>&nbsp;

> You've spent the last few days following the **High Road** south from Neverwinter, and have just turned east onto the **Triboar Trail**. You've encountered no trouble so far, but the untamed areas of **[the North](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bDWf-0ht1IYieiSZvKOOMqOuRYOb0tEu/view?usp=sharing)** are dangerous. Bandits, monsters and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail. 

>&nbsp;

> It is [Ches](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjZ_105Obng3Gt14U9USzN3T6Io2z46W/view?usp=sharing) the 16th, just a few days before the spring equinox. This far north, it's still quite cold out. The weather has been fair during your journey so far, but it's known to turn quickly in the Savage Frontier and northern Sword Coast regions.

>&nbsp;

> The geography of the North ranges from the rugged mountains of the Spine of the World to the lush forests of Lurkwood and Moonwood and a great deal more in between. Within these highly unique areas lie ruined towers, lost gold, and enough rumors to keep even the most active adventuring company busy.

# **About the Game**
***
###**The Adventure**

***Lost Mine of Phandelver*** is a wonderful introduction to D&D [5e] and the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for both new and experienced adventurers wanting that ""classic"" D&D experience. You will get to experience a balanced offering of all three pillars of adventure: exploration, combat and social encounters. This adventure is designed to take characters from **levels 1 to 5** and can easily transition into more expansive and challenging adventure modules, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* and more!

&nbsp;

###**Scheduling**

We'll be playing **weekly(ish) on Saturdays**. Tentative time will be **[2-6pm EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250125T190000&p1=tz_et)**, but I can be flexible on the start time by ¬±4 hours or so. Sessions will go for 3-4 hours with a break somewhere in the middle. 

&nbsp;

I'm hoping for this to become a **long-term campaign**, so I'm looking for committed players. Occasional absences are entirely expected and not unreasonable. I, myself, will be absent on game day twice in the next couple of months. Let's all just try to maintain good overall attendance and give notice ahead of time, whenever possible, if you can't make it. I'm okay with continuing if we have 1 player absent, but more than that and I usually will postpone the session. I'm happy to run oneshots or even other adventures for players that still want to play on the off-weeks.

&nbsp;

###**Hardware/Software**

You will need the following:

- PC/Laptop with Chrome/Firefox and reliable internet

- Microphone or headset with a decent, working mic. 

- Discord app for voice and video (webcams will always be optional but are strongly encouraged)

- Free accounts on the [Forge](https://forge-vtt.com/account/signup) and [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/create-account?returnUrl=https://www.dndbeyond.com/)

&nbsp;

###**Game Features**

We'll use D&D Beyond to create and manage your character sheets which will be imported into the game. Access to the book content will be provided once you're in the game, you won't have to buy anything. I like to use some mods for the game, such as, ""Dice so Nice"" and ""Polyglot,"" that add fun, immersive features to the game such as customizable dice and special language fonts for the in-game chatbox that can only be read/translated by players with characters that read or speak that language. Quality-of-life mods such as a HUD for quickly making rolls and referencing will also be included.

&nbsp;

###**Table Talk: Guidelines and Ground Rules**

* You don't have to start with an intricately-detailed backstory, although that is certainly welcome. Broad-strokes are fine and fleshing out a character as we go is to be expected. Start out with their basic drives, bonds, flaws, strengths and so on and then go from there.
* There will be no erotic roleplaying. Instead, we use things like ""fade to black,"" a convenient smash-cut to another character, or something along those lines.
* ""R-rated"" violence and swearing will be common enough, but there will be no descriptions of extreme gore. 
* Teamwork! Antagonistic/malicious actions against other player characters generally will not be allowed. If you think it would be interesting/compelling to have your character butt heads with another in the party, speak with the player about it first and make sure they are cool with it.
* You'll never be expected to have anything memorized. However, I do ask that you at least be familiar with the basics of your character's features/abilities and to know where to look stuff up if it's not already on your sheet. The VTT will perform most of the roll calculations for us, which is extremely convenient, but it's not always perfect and you should be aware of which stats/mods are being used in the rolls you're making. I'll always be there to help where I can, but I also rely on my players to meet me halfway.

&nbsp;

# **About the DM**
***
I'm in my mid-30's and have been DMing for several years now. Almost all of my experience lies in 5th ed. D&D, mostly playing online. I love D&D for combining some of my favorite things; hanging out with friends, collaborative story-telling and gaming! I also DM a weekly Sunday game that is now just two players and myself, but it's been going for four years and I feel so lucky to have found them. Maybe I'm being greedy, but I want more of that in my life and that's why I'm here!

&nbsp;

I would say my style overall is casual. I'm not a pro by any means, but I do my best! I try to make the games feel immersive with added visuals, such as additional maps/battlemaps, artwork, music (I often like to use movie soundtracks), and sometimes I'll even muck around with a voicemod app for special NPCs and monsters. Expect to see some of the encounters done in ""theater of the mind,"" as well. I like to do character voices here and there, but I won't be ""in character"" the whole time. 

&nbsp;

I don't mind some [meta](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=fed3e2472714e5db&q=what+is+metagaming+in+DnD&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ1Ymii5GLAxU5HjQIHfcrPZAQBSgAegQICRAB&biw=1707&bih=906&dpr=1.5)-discussion; in fact, I try to encourage players to think strategically and to ask questions. But, I also believe that it should mostly be done before or after the actual game (or at least during our mid-game break) in order to keep things immersive and compelling for everyone. I want to strike a balance between actually enjoying the mechanics (and mastering them) along with the story-telling aspects of the game.

&nbsp;

I tend to go with the rules-as-written in making rulings, but I never try to use the rules as a ""gotcha"" against players or to undermine your intentions. I do make mistakes sometimes and will simply tell my players about it (if needed), unless they were the ones to catch it, and then just try to move on as gracefully as we can.

&nbsp;

I don't tolerate bigotry, disrespect, or other forms of assholery; the number one rule is [be excellent](https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/bill-ted-excellent-riff/) to each other!

&nbsp;

***
# **Character Creation** 
***
Characters will be created when we get together for the planning session, or ""Session 0,"" where we'll introduce ourselves and get to know one another while crafting your characters and familiarizing yourselves with D&D, Foundry, Discord and D&D Beyond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed, I'm happy to help!

&nbsp;

Even though character creation won't ""officially"" occur until Session 0, please keep in mind the following character and roleplaying guidelines, in case you already have ideas:

&nbsp;

* Characters will be created at **Level 1**. 
* Ability scores will be determined using the **Standard Array** (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or **[Point Buy](http://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html)** (PHB pg. 13).
* If you don't want to take one of the standard equipment load-outs for your class, then you can roll for starting wealth (PHB pg. 143). No re-rolls!
* Rolls must be made in-game with the group present.
* Characters will be good-aligned, i.e., Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good or whatever particular shade your character may be. Their exact alignment isn't important (unless you want that element in particular to be in their character-arc), but just know that evil or ""true neutral"" characters won't be allowed for this one.
* No content from 2024 Player's Handbook, Unearthed Arcana (UA) or homebrewed races/classes. 
* Customized backgrounds are encouraged, just run them by me first and remember that your characters are level 1.
* This adventure will take place in the [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) campaign setting; races/species and other content from settings such as Eberron, Greyhawk, Planescape, Ravnica, etc., will not be featured.
* Content from the *Player's Handbook (2014)*, *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* and *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse* may be used. Content from other sources, such as Volo's Guide to Monsters, Elemental Evil Player's Companion, other modules, older editions, etc., will require some further discussion. 

&nbsp;

# **Applying for the Game**
***
Interested? Please fill out this [application](https://forms.gle/LEp5987yj52PEERK9). For the sake of my own sanity, I will not be able to respond to everyone who applies and I won't reply to messages here on Reddit. **If you don't hear back from me on DISCORD** in the next 24 hours, then I'm afraid you won't be in the game. If you're flexible and want to be kept in mind in case someone has to drop out, be sure to mention that in the application. I'm grateful for your time and interest, regardless. Thank you and happy adventuring!

"Create Magic with a Princess Party in Fort Lauderdale, FL",u_theonlineforyou,1i9sqxe,2025-01-25 12:58:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1i9sqxe/create_magic_with_a_princess_party_in_fort/,theonlineforyou,,"Throwing a princess-themed party for your child is a wonderful way to create a magical, unforgettable experience. In Fort Lauderdale, FL, the warm weather, scenic venues, and vibrant culture make it the perfect place to bring a fairy tale celebration to life. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a birthday party or a special gathering, this guide will help you plan an enchanting event that will leave everyone feeling like royalty.

# 1. Choose a Stunning Venue

Fort Lauderdale is filled with breathtaking venues that set the stage for a magical celebration. Whether you prefer the beauty of a beachfront location, the serenity of a park, or the comfort of your own backyard, the city offers endless possibilities.

For an outdoor party, you can decorate the space with castles, flowing drapes, and floral arrangements to create a fairy-tale-like setting. Indoor venues can be transformed into royal ballrooms with sparkling lights, colorful balloons, and themed decorations that make the event feel straight out of a storybook.

# 2. Start with Magical Invitations

Set the tone for your princess party by sending out elegant invitations that capture the magical theme. Scroll-style invitations or cards adorned with crowns, castles, or fairy tale illustrations can excite guests and give them a preview of what‚Äôs to come.

Don‚Äôt forget to include important details, such as the date, time, location, and a note encouraging kids to dress up as their favorite princess or prince. Digital invitations with animated effects or music are also a fun way to make an impression.

# 3. Transform the Space with Princess-Themed D√©cor

To create a magical atmosphere, focus on decorations that reflect the fairy tale theme. Use pastel colors like pink, lavender, and gold, combined with shimmering accents like glittery tablecloths and fairy lights.

Set up a castle backdrop or throne area for photo opportunities, and add touches like tiaras, wands, and floral centerpieces to the tables. A royal touch of elegance will make the kids feel like they‚Äôve stepped into a magical kingdom.

# 4. Dress Up for the Occasion

Encourage the kids to come dressed in their favorite princess or prince costumes to get into the spirit of the party. For added fun, create a dress-up corner where they can don capes, tiaras, crowns, or accessories like wands and jewelry.

A mini makeover station can also be a big hit. Offer glittery face paint, temporary tattoos, or simple hairstyles to complete their royal transformation. Seeing the little ones dressed up adds an extra layer of magic to the event.

# 5. Keep the Kids Entertained with Fun Activities

The heart of any princess party is the fun and interactive activities that keep kids engaged. Here are some great ideas:

* **Interactive Storytime:** A princess can read classic fairy tales, inviting the kids to join in on the magical adventures.
* **Craft Stations:** Let kids create their own crowns, wands, or bracelets to take home as keepsakes.
* **Royal Dance Party:** Play their favorite princess songs and encourage the kids to twirl and dance like royalty.
* **Treasure Hunts:** Hide ""royal jewels"" or other treasures around the venue for the kids to find.
* **Princess Games:** Organize activities like freeze dance, ‚Äúpin the crown on the princess,‚Äù or a royal relay race.

These activities not only entertain but also create lasting memories for the kids and their families.

# 6. Serve a Feast Fit for Royalty

A princess party isn‚Äôt complete without a delicious menu that‚Äôs fit for royalty. Create a spread of treats that match the theme, like sandwiches shaped like crowns, cookies with sparkly icing, and cupcakes decorated with edible flowers.

For beverages, serve ‚Äúmagic potion‚Äù drinks such as pink lemonade, fruit punch, or sparkling juice in elegant cups. Of course, the highlight of the feast should be a beautifully themed cake featuring tiaras, castles, or fairy tale characters.

# 7. Add a Princess Performer for Extra Magic

To truly elevate your princess party, consider hiring a professional performer to bring the magic to life. Watching their favorite princess interact with them in person is an unforgettable experience for kids.

The performer can sing songs, tell stories, and lead games or dances, making the event even more enchanting. They can also take part in key moments like the cake cutting or posing for photos, creating picture-perfect memories that will last a lifetime.

# 8. Create Lasting Memories with Photos

Capture every magical moment of the day by setting up a photo area with a themed backdrop. Use props like crowns, wands, and royal chairs to make the pictures extra special.

Consider hiring a photographer or asking a friend to take candid shots of the kids enjoying the party. These photos will become cherished keepsakes that you and your child can look back on for years to come.

# 9. Send Guests Home with Magical Favors

End the day on a high note by sending guests home with thoughtful party favors. Fill goodie bags with princess-themed items like mini tiaras, wands, stickers, or bracelets.

You can also include crafts the kids made during the party or framed photos of them with the princess as personalized keepsakes. These little touches leave a lasting impression and remind guests of the magical day.

# 10. Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs Unique Charm Enhances the Experience

Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs sunny weather and picturesque locations make it the perfect backdrop for a princess party. Whether you‚Äôre celebrating at a beachfront venue or a cozy garden, the city‚Äôs natural beauty and lively atmosphere create a setting that feels straight out of a fairy tale.

# Final Thoughts

A princess party in Fort Lauderdale, FL, is the perfect way to celebrate your child‚Äôs special day. With the right venue, magical d√©cor, fun activities, and a touch of royal charm, you can create an unforgettable event filled with laughter, joy, and wonder.

Whether you‚Äôre hosting a grand celebration or an intimate gathering, Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs unique charm and family-friendly vibe ensure that your **princess Fort Lauderdale FL** party will be a magical experience for everyone involved."

My Narrative (Act 1-3 Heavy Heavy Spoilers),Pathfinder_Kingmaker,1i9rrmr,2025-01-25 12:15:52,6,0.87,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/1i9rrmr/my_narrative_act_13_heavy_heavy_spoilers/,Grand_Brain_487,Righteous : Story,"Zarus, the Eldritch Apostate

Born under a moonless sky, Zarus's origins remain shrouded in mystery. His first memories are of the hot stone halls of a temple devoted to a cruel and unyielding god. Raised by zealots who sought to mold him into a weapon of malice, Zarus was an anomaly among his kin. While other tiefling children reveled in the malevolence encouraged by their elders, Zarus's heart rebelled. The darkness that seemed to come naturally to others felt alien to him.
What set Zarus apart‚Äîwhat earned him the favor of Desna‚Äîwas his willingness to believe that his choices alone determined his fate. He rejected the idea that gods, birth, or fate dictated the path he must walk. This belief, though born of defiance and self-preservation, aligned with Desna‚Äôs ideals of freedom and self-determination. Though her intervention was subtle and cloaked in mystery, it was Desna‚Äôs blessing that helped Zarus channel the strength to break free from the chains of his past and escape the indoctrination of his youth.
Branded an apostate and outcast, Zarus fled the temple, carrying little more than his bow, his wits, and a burning desire to find a place where he could simply exist without doctrine.
For Zarus, breaking free from the indoctrination of his childhood was an act of sheer will, not overt divine intervention. He felt abandoned by the Good-aligned gods, who had watched his suffering but never lifted a hand to help. Redemption, in Zarus's eyes, is unnecessary‚Äîhe does not believe he needs to atone for something he never chose. His only goal was to escape the fate others tried to impose on him and live life on his own terms.
The Dual Nature of Power
Zarus‚Äôs eldritch power is a constant reminder of the life he left behind and the strength he gained through his struggles. While he recognizes its dark origins, he has come to understand that there is something more at work within it‚Äîa mysterious blessing from Desna. Through her subtle guidance, Zarus has learned to channel this power for good, wielding it with precision and purpose.
Yet, the darkness within his magic still calls to him. When he is strong, Zarus uses his abilities to protect the innocent and uphold the freedom he values. But when he is weak‚Äîwhen memories of his past creep in or he feels powerless‚Äîthe whispers grow louder, tempting him with promises of strength and ease. He fights against this pull, knowing that his power is a tool, not a master, but the struggle is ongoing.
For Zarus, Desna represents freedom and self-determination, not redemption. She does not demand he change who he is, only that he forge his own path. This faith resonates deeply with Zarus, who sees Desna‚Äôs ideals as the savior to his tormented past.
A Chance Encounter
In his travels, Zarus encountered people who showed him kindness, not despite his infernal heritage but because they saw his heart. A wandering priest of Desna once took him in after finding him wounded in the forest. The priest‚Äôs words were simple yet profound: ‚ÄúGood and evil are choices, not destinies. And much lays beyond Good and Evil alone‚Äù
These words helped Zarus understand that he was not bound by the circumstances of his birth or the expectations of others. While he grew to trust Desna, he remained wary of other good-aligned gods. Their rigid ideals of righteousness felt oppressive, restrictive and separate from the harsh reality he knew. Their strict ways reminded him of the judgment he had endured in his youth and his constant struggle with the possibility of true redemption under such an idealistic code. Zarus, who does not seek their favor or forgiveness; he sees no need to justify his existence to them. They abandoned him in his birth and his fate had carved him towards evil. It was his actions, not the actions of any god, that freed him from his past.
Present Day
Now a seasoned traveler, Zarus roams from town to town, seeking to experience, explore and understand the true purpose in life. He never stops to aid those who are struggling but leaves quickly as forming attachments bring fear of rejection, betrayal, commitment or emotional connection. Yet those who meet him never forget his deeply tormented soul and the unwavering non-judgemental understanding and altruism it generates. His chaotic neutral nature means he values freedom above all detesting both malicious evil for what it did to him and the restrictive, self-righteous orders of Lawful Good that never aided him. His Tiefling appearance, fondness for self-fulfilment and poetry draw him to spend his life under the mystical but often lonely grace of Desna‚Äôs light.
Beneath his standoffish exterior lies a soul at peace with his past, though not completely without internal conflict. Zarus has no desire for redemption; his only wish is to live freely, untethered by the chains of his past. Still, the duality of his power forces him to walk a fine line, with the darkness of his heritage ever ready to reclaim him.
Guided by the stars and Desna‚Äôs quiet influence, Zarus continues to chart his own course, proving with every step that his fate belongs to him alone.


Act 1

Having emerged from the brutal battle for Kerebaras, Zarus stood on the edge of a precipice, the weight of his journey settling heavily upon him. The war against the Worldwound had only just begun, and the chaos unleashed by the Crusades felt like a tempest growing ever stronger around him. He had fought alongside allies whose causes were righteous in their eyes, yet he found himself questioning the ideals they held dear. He had witnessed horrors that reminded him of the twisted teachings of his childhood‚Äîfanaticism, blind loyalty, and the dark urge. Despite all the battles and bloodshed, Zarus‚Äôs resolve remained unchanged: he would not be tethered by others' notions of fate or righteousness. The darkness within him was still there, a gnawing presence he couldn't completely escape, but it no longer defined him. His journey was his own, a path of his choosing, and whatever the coming storm brought, Zarus would face it with the same defiance and independence that had guided him from the very beginning. 

When Zarus struck the Wardstone under the blessing of the Aeons he felt their lawful self-righteousness consume him. Their blessing and their power gave him the strength to push back the Eldritch call gnawing at his mind and he vanquished the demons who gathered before him. After the fight Iomeadae and Desna themselves appeared to Zarus in a dream and offered him freedom from his cursed past. Desna had seen the destiny which lay before him and Iomeadae knew they could work together to change fate. When he restrained the dark call as he gazed forth into the Wardstone Iomeadae, hearing the pleas of Desna, offered to lift his curse, renew his spirit and redeem his soul but at the cost of losing his connection with the Eldritch powers within. Zarus, fearful of the power he wielded in the shield maze and of the darkness consuming him relinquished his Eldritch essence and embraced the life of a Demon Slayer. But as the Gods drifted back to their heavens Zarus knew he had stolen the Wardstone‚Äôs power for himself. To use the gift of strength to restore balance and then toss it back aside to the whims of fate and chaos. Zarus saw that he had the strength to rise to the call but not the spirit to serve blindly and eternally. And as Zarus drifted deeper into his dreams he heard echoing maniacal laughter as he saw prismatic colours spiral, engulf and shatter the Wardstone and the codified laws inscribed upon it. Only to wake to the sight of a nobel Elk standing boldly before him as if to remind of how deeply he craves true freedom but is forced to embrace the noble destiny before him.

Act 2 part 1
As the leader of the crusade against the forces of the Abyss, the weight of responsibility pressed heavily upon Zarus. The Worldwound, a vast scar on the land where demons and darkness reign, continued to threaten the realm of mortals. Zarus already proven himself as a force to be reckoned with in the struggle, but the war was far from over. With the demons‚Äô numbers growing, his mission becomes clear: to push deeper into the Worldwound and rid the land of the Abyss‚Äôs influence once and for all.
Zarus‚Äô journey shifted into the Wilderness, a region plagued by demons and monstrous creatures, and filled with factions vying for power in the midst of the chaos. Here, Zarus faced not only external threats, but internal divisions. His allies has their own agendas, their own desires for power, and navigating these complex relationships becomes as important as leading the army to victory on the battlefield. When Zarus stumbled upon Regill and the remnants of his Hell Knight legion it presented this very dilemma. A skilled, cunning and experienced commander whose ruthless adherence to law and order strikes fear and terror into all manner of men and women, including his own legion. Yet Regill‚Äôs tact and unwavering allegiance to his cause makes him a powerful ally against the demon horde. Zarus‚Äôs own cunning beckoned him. His army is too small and the self-righteous forces of Good never saved him. At the advice of his good friend Lann Zarus‚Äô welcomed Regill into his crusade. Not out of love or goddess but out of respect for the power he commands and the trust he has in Regill‚Äôs resolute obedience to his duty.
Zarus‚Äô path led him closer to Drezen where he faced the Swarm Queen. Pressed with a difficult decision, Zarus chose to send Irabeth into the swarm. Not to conquer it but to distract it as he led himself deeper towards the Swarm Queen. Irabeth deep commitment to the cause and her strength would be essential to win the crusade but there was no one else he could trust with such an essential mission. After a grueling journey through treacherous terrain, Zarus finally tracked her to her lair ignoring the glint of gold armour and jewelry adorning all the caravaneers who fell before his arrival.
The battle against the Swarm Queen was a test of his strength and cunning. Her forces were relentless and the swarm was nearly overwhelming.But with a final, decisive blow, fueled by the prayers and blessings of Iomeade & Desna Zarus brought the Swarm Queen to her knees, her swarm of demons dissipating in the wake of her death. The land breathes a temporary sigh of relief, and the crusade gains a much-needed victory.
Yet, in the aftermath of the battle, the sense of triumph is fleeting. Her defeat is merely a single victory in a war that stretches far beyond the reach of one battle. It becomes clear that the forces of the Abyss are far more deeply entrenched than he ever imagined, and the Swarm Queen was but a piece of a far larger puzzle. While his enemies are momentarily scattered, they will soon regroup, and the true extent of their plans is still shrouded in mystery. Zarus, upon learning of the trickery played upon him from within his ranks was faced with a difficult decision. The swarm was truly powerful, and the scent-soaked cloths could be turned against the very swarm itself. Could Zarus harness this power against the demon swarm? Or would the swarm turn and consume what is left of the crusaders? Zarus, a man who knew the powerful call of the Eldritch force, its corrupting whispers and warm abyssal blanket that can only come from limitless power, stared deeply at the cloth before tucking it quietly into his cloak. His companions saw him and were left with their own quiet, nervous distrust of his decision but only one spoke up. Their numbers are too low and the swarm‚Äôs power is too great to throw away such a powerful tool, even if it could consume them. And Zarus deep within himself asked can darkness be used for good after all? Or will he fall into his Tiefling urges and childhood indoctrination failing to complete his new destiny?
Zarus, descending deep into the caverns was tested again. Having battled through the Wights on the water‚Äôs edge, he found the source of their necromancy. The darkness whispered to him, encouraging him to take the power for himself as he did the swarms cloth. Only through the wands strength, the strength of the swarm and his partnership with Regill could he ever hope to defeat the demonic horde at Drezen. And the angel‚Äôs quiet whisper, the angels  who abandoned him since the moments of his birth, spoke so softly he almost didn‚Äôt hear it. Destroy it. Destroy this power once and for all. For how can you hope to defeat the demonic horde with the very darkness that first brought it here. And Zarus, without his companions looking, quietly tucked away the wand within his pouch as he contemplated if the Angelic Host could ever hope to defeat the demonic horde if it wasn‚Äôt willing to bend the rules in such pressing circumstances. And that night, as Zarus set up his camp with his companions he reflected on how this 5th crusade had come about from the failures of the Lawful Good. The failures of the light to protect him and the failure of the gods to have him be born a murderous, malicious, blood soaked Tiefling given to the temple of Baphomet so long ago.
Zarus continued to adventure forth moving even closer to the city of Drezen. Several victories by his crusader army left them all in high morale as they approached the citadel. But as his army came closer they were quickly taken by ambush. Gargoyle raiders over-took them taking the crusaders. His companions and his generals flying off deep into the night. Zarus pushed and found the strength of his army was much greater than he first realized. His army had already begun to overthrow the gargoyle swarm but the risen crusaders, this growing Ghoul army made it impossible for his allies to achieve victory. Zarus pressed forth slaying the Gargoyle king using the same inner light that saved Kenebres. But Zarus felt it corrupted, or maybe strengthened, by his anger. His rage. His latent Eldritch power coming forth again as he unleashed his final arrow then wathcing the Gargoyle King fall. Despite his weakness and growing lust for power, causing him to stow the rag and the wand, this time he harnessed the power for the Light. To redeem mankind, to redeem this world but most importantly to redeem himself of all the dark shadows of his past.
	As Zarus‚Äô and his companions descended from the mountain top he felt an Eldritch force call to him from beneath the fortress. Zarus‚Äô descended into its catacombs feeling pulled by the wand which rested inside his pouch. The stench of the catacombs was appalling and he slew the ghouls which littered this unholy pit until he found Zacharius the lich king himself standing before him. Zacharius demanded the return of his wand, his phylactery, in exchange for unfathomable power. A power over life and death strong enough to repel the demonic horde. Zacharius himself preached how he too could join his forces with Zarus and seal shut the Worldwound. Despite the temptation of power Zarus knew that would only leave him once again enthralled in darkness for the rest of eternity, He had broken free from his dark past, lead the first successful push of the crusade and now is once again tested by the dark. The dark which strengthened him when he was young but plunged him into spiritual nihilism. Zarus refused and Zacharius unleashed his dark magic upon the crusaders but Zarus was prepared. A lifetime as an acolyte of the Temple of Baphomet left him ready and Zacharius was finally slain, marking another great victory that day. But the deep thoughts began once again resonating inside Zarus‚Äô deep mind. The crusades had failed 4 times before. The light had not saved them as the darkness always pushed them back. Maybe what Zarus needed was the darkness itself. He reflected on the rag stowed in his pouch, his own Eldritch past and the power it gave him today. And Zarus wondered, maybe he would have to risk his life and his soul. Maybe he would have to use the darkness itself to defeat it and pray the Gods of the light would contain the evil within him enough that the corrupt did not consume him entirely. As Zarus slept that night he heard Desna speak to him ‚ÄúThere is the path we pick for ourselves, and the path fate picks for us combating each other intensely as we move forward into our uncertain destiny‚Äù. And as Desna‚Äôs voice faded he heard a maniacal laughter. ‚ÄúMorality, fate, destiny, light, darkness. These are all but tools ever swirling, ever mixing as we move into our chaotic future. The choice is always yours but the outcome is never known. How do we then choose? Or do we accept our broken fates, the unresolvable reality of suffering and live, freely for ourselves and for today? Beyond law, beyond fate beyond Good and Evil‚Äù
As Zarus fought through the fort of Drezen he witnessed the death and suffering of friend and foe alike. Slaughter, murder, screams. The sounds of his childhood. Keeping his internal suffering quiet he fought deep into the heart of the citadel and retrieved the Sword of Valour. The deep wound inside his heart opened once again. Three choices lay before him. The path of the angel. The ascendant righteous warriors who are too good and too proud to meddle in the affairs of men. The path of the demon. The dark force within him given sentience. Unleash it and he will become more powerful than anyone else in this realm but he would become one with the very force he fought so hard to escape. Lastly he saw the Aeons. Law-makers and law keepers of the great divide who seek to guide this realm to their foretold destiny. A secret counsel whose rules of law had yet to manifest a realm without extreme suffering. Zarus stood, starring at the doors. His pragmatic, morally grey essence staring at the three choices caused Zarus to stumble. He fell to his knees in laughter and in tears. No earthly, celestial or divine force can overcome this endless cycle. The constant turning of fate, destiny, choice. Good and evil. Luck and misfortune. Zarus starred deeply into these intertwining cosmic forces which span endlessly across time. There was no stepping above it. This became clear. His only choice was to step beyond. Into an unthinkable realm. Of madness, of chaos, of freedom, of liberty and of doing whatever he needed to do to lay this realm at peace. His eye, but for a moment glimpsed a dimension beyond the rule of law. Not an abyssal void but a realm where his imagination could become real. Where his choices, his will would bend reality. Not into suffering but into a new shape that would meld and break the dogmas of the past. Zarus feared this force for its unpredictability but felt it was the only force he could trust for it was the only force which came from within him directly. And Zarus gave himself to it. To the Gods of Freedom, liberty and Chaos feeling his first step towards his new place in the universe. Or should we say his place between it.
Zarus‚Äô reputation spread quickly and the banner of the sword of valor shifted to a set of dice. Funny. Zarus always viewed his life and his destiny as one built on choice and determination. Of wise action and maybe a touch of faith not chance but luck was exactly what saved him, and what put him here. This mysterious power that has both blessed and cursed him did not come from him alone. It was fates heavy hand that placed this burden upon his shoulders. & Zarus knew, that his freedom, his independence and his selfishness much be set aside to close shut the Worldwound. For the gods and the crusaders seemed to favour him for this destiny. 
Zarus quickly took the helm of command. Assembling counsels, leading the first few expeditions and instructing the armies to push back the demonic forces that have inched closer to Drezen. And Zarus was effective. Quickly the city and the surrounding area had been stabilized and he began to softly calculate his next moves. But there was a more mysterious counsel. One which lay inside his wardrobe. A collective of various factions, often in conflict, which sought to unify against this threat. And Zarus had been invited. Given his power, his rank and his reputation for silence and non-judgement the counsel welcomed him amongst the table so they too could silently plan the fate of the Worldwound.
Zarus rescued Woljif, enlisted Greybor but it was Arueshalae who caught his eye. A fellow demon who forsakened their twisted fate to embrace a new destiny. One which would aid in sealing shut the doorway of corruption for the remainder of this aeon. But Arueshalae found fault in her own action, fault in her past, fault in herself for being born a demon and a succubus where as Zarus knew it was the Aeons cruel game which placed him like a pawn inside that temple at his birth. But something about Arueshalae‚Äôs beauty. A light shining under the soft pink skin called to Zarus. His heart beat heavier when she was around and as they fought they arrows flew in near unison as they inched closer to the worldwound.

1. The True History of the Void Century
	‚Ä¢	Clues:
	‚Ä¢	The Void Century is a 100-year period erased from history by the World Government.
	‚Ä¢	The Poneglyphs, scattered around the world, contain fragments of this lost history. Nico Robin‚Äôs goal is to uncover it.
	‚Ä¢	Gol D. Roger‚Äôs crew, including himself, learned the True History when they reached Laugh Tale.
	‚Ä¢	Rayleigh told Robin that they discovered everything but didn‚Äôt reveal it, implying it‚Äôs deeply impactful.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	If the One Piece includes the full account of the Void Century, it could expose the crimes of the World Government and the fall of the Ancient Kingdom.
	‚Ä¢	Roger‚Äôs laughter may stem from an ironic truth, such as the World Government hiding something absurdly simple yet world-changing.

2. Physical Treasure
	‚Ä¢	Clues:
	‚Ä¢	Roger referred to the One Piece as a ‚Äúgreat treasure.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Oda has confirmed the One Piece is not symbolic and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something real that will make people happy.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Whitebeard‚Äôs final words emphasized that the discovery of the One Piece would shake the world.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	While a literal treasure chest of gold and jewels could exist, the One Piece is likely more than that. It could be artefacts, technology, or a tangible item tied to the Ancient Kingdom, such as plans for reshaping the world.

3. The Ancient Weapons
	‚Ä¢	Clues:
	‚Ä¢	The Ancient Weapons‚ÄîPluton, Poseidon, and Uranus‚Äîare world-destroying tools from the Void Century.
	‚Ä¢	Poseidon (Shirahoshi) has already been revealed, while Pluton lies beneath Alabasta, and Uranus remains unknown.
	‚Ä¢	These weapons are tied to the Poneglyphs and the legacy of the Ancient Kingdom.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	If the One Piece involves the Ancient Weapons, it would explain Whitebeard‚Äôs claim that it could ‚Äúturn the world upside down.‚Äù These weapons could be used to overthrow the World Government or reshape the seas.

4. A Plan to Destroy the Red Line
	‚Ä¢	Clues:
	‚Ä¢	The Red Line divides the world and separates the Grand Line from the Four Blues.
	‚Ä¢	Some fan theories suggest uniting the seas into ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù (a single ocean) is the ultimate goal. Destroying the Red Line would connect all seas and bring true freedom to the world.
	‚Ä¢	The prophecy of the Sea Kings mentions the ‚ÄúDawn of the World,‚Äù which could refer to such a unification.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	If the One Piece includes plans or tools for destroying the Red Line, it would physically unite the world, creating a symbolic ‚ÄúOne Piece‚Äù and fulfilling Luffy‚Äôs dream of freedom for all.

5. Joy Boy‚Äôs Legacy
	‚Ä¢	Clues:
	‚Ä¢	Joy Boy was a key figure during the Void Century and is tied to the Ancient Kingdom, the Sea Kings, and the Noah.
	‚Ä¢	The Poneglyph in Fish-Man Island contains Joy Boy‚Äôs apology for failing to fulfill a promise.
	‚Ä¢	Luffy, as the new bearer of Joy Boy‚Äôs will, is destined to complete what Joy Boy started.
	‚Ä¢	Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	The One Piece could include Joy Boy‚Äôs final message, his unfulfilled dream, or a gift left behind to aid in uniting the world.
	‚Ä¢	Roger‚Äôs crew laughing upon discovering it might stem from the humor or irony of Joy Boy‚Äôs legacy being misunderstood or hidden for centuries.

Most Likely Scenario: A Multifaceted Treasure

Based on the clues, the One Piece is likely a combination of the True History, Joy Boy‚Äôs legacy, and a physical tool or treasure tied to the Ancient Weapons or uniting the world. For example:
	‚Ä¢	A record of the Void Century, exposing the truth about the World Government.
	‚Ä¢	A mechanism or plan to destroy the Red Line and create the ‚ÄúAll Blue.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Joy Boy‚Äôs vision for a free world, symbolizing the ultimate freedom Luffy seeks.

Roger‚Äôs laughter could have come from the irony of how simple yet profound the treasure‚Äôs meaning is, such as Joy Boy‚Äôs failed promise or the absurdity of how the world has been shaped since the Void Century.

Key Takeaway: It Will Unite Themes

The One Piece will unify the story‚Äôs core themes:
	1.	Freedom ‚Äì Luffy‚Äôs ultimate goal and the promise of a world without oppression.
	2.	Truth ‚Äì Exposing the lies of the World Government and the true history.
	3.	Adventure ‚Äì A treasure worthy of the Pirate King, inspiring the next era.

Keep the guest list size and weather conditions in mind when choosing your venue.

# 3. Bring the Magic with Stunning Decorations

Transforming your venue into a magical kingdom is all about the details. Use decorations that align with your theme and bring the fairy-tale world to life.

* **Color Scheme:** Stick to pastel shades like pink, lavender, and gold for a classic princess vibe, or opt for icy blues and silvers for a winter theme.
* **Royal Touches:** Add elements like castle banners, tiaras, and glittering table centerpieces.
* **Photo Area:** Create a photo booth with a princess-themed backdrop, props like wands and crowns, and sparkly accents.

With the right decorations, any space can feel like a scene from a storybook.

# 4. Hire a Princess Performer

One of the most magical ways to elevate your princess party is by inviting a real-life princess. Professional princess performers bring fairy tales to life with their costumes, charm, and ability to connect with children.

* **What They Offer:** Performers often sing iconic songs, tell captivating stories, and lead games or activities.
* **Why It‚Äôs Special:** Meeting their favorite princess in person is a dream come true for many kids and creates unforgettable memories.

Make sure to book your princess early, as they‚Äôre often in high demand for weekend events.

# 5. Plan Engaging Activities

A successful princess party keeps the kids entertained with fun and interactive activities. Tailor the activities to your theme for an immersive experience.

* **Craft Stations:** Set up areas where kids can decorate tiaras, wands, or bracelets with glitter and jewels.
* **Storytelling Time:** Have the princess or a parent read a classic fairy tale.
* **Treasure Hunts:** Create a scavenger hunt for hidden ‚Äúroyal treasures‚Äù around the venue.
* **Dance Party:** Play iconic princess songs and encourage the kids to show off their royal dance moves.

These activities will keep the kids engaged and ensure everyone has a great time.

# 6. Serve a Royal Feast

The food at a princess party should be as magical as the event itself. Create a menu that ties into the theme while catering to young appetites.

* **Cupcakes and Cakes:** Decorate cupcakes with edible glitter, crowns, or princess-themed toppers.
* **Themed Snacks:** Serve sandwiches cut into shapes like stars and crowns, along with fruit skewers resembling wands.
* **Royal Drinks:** Offer pink lemonade or ‚Äúfairy punch‚Äù in fancy cups with decorative straws.

A beautifully decorated cake featuring castles or tiaras will be the centerpiece of the celebration.

# 7. Send Guests Home with Magical Favors

Thank your guests for coming with party favors that match the princess theme. Some ideas include:

* Mini tiaras or wands
* Stickers or coloring books
* Sparkly bracelets or necklaces
* Personalized thank-you notes

Thoughtful party favors will leave a lasting impression and serve as a reminder of the magical day.

# 8. Capture the Memories

Don‚Äôt forget to document every magical moment! Whether you hire a photographer or take photos yourself, capturing the smiles and laughter of the day is essential.

* **Photo Booth Fun:** Encourage kids to pose with props and princess-themed backdrops.
* **Candid Moments:** Snap photos during activities like crafts and storytelling to capture the excitement.

These photos will become cherished keepsakes for years to come.

# Final Thoughts

Creating a magical princess party in NYC is all about bringing fairy-tale dreams to life through thoughtful planning, creative d√©cor, and engaging activities. With the city‚Äôs incredible venues and talented entertainers, the possibilities for hosting a memorable event are endless.

By focusing on the details that matter most‚Äîlike a captivating theme, fun activities, and an enchanting atmosphere‚Äîyou‚Äôll ensure a celebration that leaves your child feeling like royalty. Get ready to create a day filled with joy, laughter, and plenty of magic with your very own **princess NYC** experience!"

Today I have worlds to choose and one was used for short, spess DnD campaign. 

  
*1. Land of Erros. A mainland consisting of many kingdoms and lordships. A place truly fit for those who seek gold and blood. War here never really did end: there was always a war somewhere. But I don't worry for the sword on my neck, or the dagger in my belly. For what I really worry deeply, is one particular dark mage. You might say, what he did? Did he make skeletons go dancing and stole your booze? You'd say it's too precise, and I say: yes, it did happen. It took a place. But they just didn't waltzed in and took the bottle. I'd say... It was an intimidation. I, of course, take a lot of insults in my address since I am the Harbor Chief. But... They came with heads on their belts. They put a sign in front of my house, built out of bones and the words there written by fecal matter. ""Your next"". Those were skeletons wearing different armour, but I saw not just three. Not just ten or twenty. I saw 30, death silent cadavers. That's why this paper exists! A group of fine and well adventurers. To seek this dark mage and... Probably unleash the same treatment he wanted to do to me. I will be really glad if you would come at the address written underneath, and you would help me. Please.*

*2. United Space Territories. A term that once had a huge respect and everyone once obeyed to its laws. Sadly, now all that is Space: are smugglers, pirates and not only on them the list ends. I saw death cults praising the God of Blood while making the corpse look like a whole cherry pie. I saw how the machines went rogue and their insanity crawled upon the crew of the starship, making it a whole other different kind of bloodbath. I saw how Space swallowed whole innocent: their mind was and then blank. Nothing. Void. I had many wars. I had many deaths. I had many kills. I record this death-letter of mine to give one last distress signal before my lungs go black. I want someone to investigate Fed's Starship ""Laios"". Get a gun, friends too. It was Security Officer Jenkins Browlow, off signal-* ***SHOOT***



Now, I'll say few words about me and you may jump right into my DMs.

I write lit style, 3rd person, require at least 1 paragraph coming out of you or more than that. Oneliners may go away, NSFW isn't allowed. Only light things as kisses and more or so close hugs, things kinda like that.

See you!

Faction sanctuaries are personalized, instanced camps where all of your characters on a server gather in a shared space. These sanctuaries serve as a hub for interaction, trading, and seamless character transitions, creating a more immersive way to manage your roster.

Key Features

Faction-Based Camps

Horde and Alliance characters each have their own distinct camps.

Camp locations are tied to faction-specific zones (e.g., Horde camps in Durotar or the Barrens; Alliance camps in Elwynn Forest or Dun Morogh).

Character Presence

All your characters appear in the camp performing idle or class-appropriate activities:

A Warrior might be sharpening a blade.

A Mage might be reading a spellbook.

A Druid could be meditating or communing with wildlife.

Customizable idle behaviors allow for unique flavor based on each character's personality.

Interactable NPCs

Each character becomes an NPC that your active character can interact with.

Features include:

Trade: Easily transfer items, gold, and materials between characters without needing a mailbox.

Dialogue: Unique interactions between your characters, showing relationships, jokes, or even rivalries.

Gear View: View each character‚Äôs equipment, stats, and talents without logging out.

Seamless Character Switching

Transition between characters directly in the camp:

Approach a character and select ""Switch Control"" to instantly play as that character.

Two options for returning to the world:

Portal Option: Open a portal to return to the last location the character was in.

Wander Option: Walk out of the camp and begin adventuring from its location.

Camp Customization

Players can customize the camp with faction-themed decorations, trophies from achievements, or rare items collected in the world.

Expandable through achievements or gold, unlocking additional areas or features, such as:

Training dummies.

A small garden or herb patch.

A forge or crafting station.

Dynamic Environment

Day/night cycles, weather, and NPC interactions make the camp feel alive.

There can be events based on your progress:

A celebration if you‚Äôve recently defeated a major boss.

Mourning or repairs if a faction leader has fallen.

Social Integration

Invite friends or guildmates to visit your camp for trading or RP purposes.

Camps can temporarily merge during cross-faction play, creating a neutral ground.

Benefits

Immersion: Makes your roster feel like a cohesive team rather than isolated individuals.

Convenience: Streamlines character management and trade, reducing reliance on mailboxes.

Roleplay Opportunities: A great addition for players who enjoy storytelling and roleplay.

Customization: Provides a new avenue for players to showcase achievements and personal style.

Potential Challenges

Technical Constraints: Managing real-time transitions between characters without load screens could be complex.

Instance Design: Balancing the personalization of camps with server load.

Abomination System - Chapter 2,HFY,1i9nrr4,2025-01-25 09:13:21,19,0.92,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9nrr4/abomination_system_chapter_2/,Darren_Park,OC,"[Chapter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/rtUs0T3xQ4)

***

I was six when I used my first healing spell. It was nothing important or grand. But as I watched the old flowers get just a little more colour in their petals and stems, I knew exactly what Class I wanted to choose.

In hindsight, perhaps, I should have explored other options to see if I had talent for them. But in our small village, even a day lost not training for your future path was a day wasted. And so, at the age of six, I locked myself into the path of a Healer.

Still, unlike Elias, I at least had a choice.

The Born Classes like him were both a subject of envy and pity. The fact that they were born with their Class already determined often meant that the System had special plans for them. They were often referred to as the System‚Äôs favoured children.

Teaming up with a Born Class was a gamble. While there were many stories of even the most regular and unimpressive adventurers developing by leaps and bounds in the presence of Born Classes, there are many more stories of the regular people dying because they were in the same part as them.

Many Born Classes often hid their status because they didn‚Äôt wish to be taken advantage of or be ostracised and blamed. It was a smart decision. If I were one of the Born Classes, I probably would have done the same.

Elias wasn‚Äôt me, however.

Just like in the previous timeline, he confessed the truth to me on the very same day we met. And now he was waiting for my answer on whether I still wanted to stay in the party with him or not.

‚ÄúI will understand if you decide to partner up with someone else,‚Äù he said sincerely. ‚ÄúYou are a Healer, after all. Guys like you are valuable.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt quite wrong. Even though I had a pretty low Level for a Healer, I still could help any beginner party save up on the potions and improve their odds in the Quests. 

However, as the party progressed, I would become less and less valuable. Abomination System has shown me some of the worst ways a party could throw out their Healers once those lost their value. Elias, at the very least, kicked me out to keep me safe.

And I killed him in return. Sticking with him seemed like a good way to atone for that.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd rather stick with someone who won‚Äôt judge me for my Level,‚Äù I said, which cheered Elias up a bit. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind, though, any reason why you told me you were a Born Class?‚Äù

There was no way to tell he was, after all. If he wanted to, he could claim to be a regular Warrior instead. Nobody could prove or say otherwise. Nobody ever had in any of our past adventures.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like secrets,‚Äù Elias answered firmly. ‚ÄúThere are few things words than a party member who puts others in danger because of their own beliefs or feelings. If we are going to work together, it is only right you know everything about me and my abilities.‚Äù

I could feel Abomination System laughing at this. It could feel my shame and guilt over hiding its existence from Elias. Especially when I echoed the sentiment and agreed with everything the other guy said.

‚ÄúSince we got that out of the way, let‚Äôs discuss our plans moving forward,‚Äù Elias pulled out a map with several areas circled in red. ‚ÄúSince there is only two of us, we can‚Äôt get any jobs above C-tier. But if we go with my schedule, we could use it to impress potential party members in joining us.‚Äù

I remembered those days quite well. C-tier missions were strictly beginner level. Nothing more dangerous than defeating a single beast or protecting small-time merchants to the nearby town. To many Born Classes, especially those of Level 50 and above, such things were way below their dignity.

Elias, however, never considered any job too small or too unimportant for himself. Even if it was something as trivial as helping a woman find her lost pet, he gave it his all. 

We spent almost two months doing the small errands until we finally caught an eye of another party member. 

However, we didn‚Äôt have time for that.

I didn‚Äôt have time for that.

If I was kicked out of the party in a year, Abomination System would lock me down into that horrible future where I killed everyone and destroyed everything. 

Changing things up so early in our adventure was a risk. But with Abomination System and its reign as alternative, it was a risk I had to take.

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt reveal my plans to Elias. 

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I smiled even as Abomination System laughed in the back of my head. ‚ÄúIf we give it our all, we are going to have a full party in no time.‚Äù

We had for weeks until I would start changing things. And so for the entirety of that time, I enjoyed the peaceful days that seemed almost like a dream.

The Quests we took on were all so small and safe that they almost felt like a game. A way to distract myself from the horrific future I would bring about if I failed. We hunted down some low-tier beasts, collected some semi-rare ingredients and helped out the civilians with small stuff they wanted to be done. 

Of course, I knew better than just wasting this peaceful time.

Whenever the night fell, I activated Abomination System. It felt like waking up from a pleasant and happy dream to face cold and harsh reality. No matter where I looked, Abomination System focused only on the worst aspects of it. It was trying to get me angry. It wanted me to be back under its control.

I knew better than to trust it. Its only use to me now was the perk of not having to sleep. And the ability to move through shadows with **[Duskwalking]**, of course.

Every time I stepped into the dark and activated that skil, I could feel the Abomination System pulling at my mind. It fed me the visions of everything I used this skill for. From assassinating lords and royalty to trapping adventurers in forever darkness, it showed me every single life I took. As well as the smile that I wore while doing it.

It only pushed me harder to find anything I could about Abomination System. I refused to believe that I was the only one to unlock Negative Levels. Given how destructive it was in the hands of a nobody like myself, I doubted that public archives would keep any record of them.

Which left me with only one option.

I switched back to normal System, my Level going back to 15 as I stepped into a dirty and empty alley. What followed next could only be described as a set of annoying little rituals I needed to perform.

Feed some meat to a rat with the red mark on its back. Hum a quiet melody of children‚Äôs nursery. Stand in the same place for an hour, staring at only one wall and nothing else.

If I didn‚Äôt have my past memories to rely on, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed this was a real way to get inside the lost city.

‚ÄúPassword?‚Äù

I tossed my small sack of coins at the wall. I watched it sink into the stony surface like it was made of water. There wasn‚Äôt much inside but money was not what these people wanted.

They wanted to know you gave them all that you had. All without any guarantee that you would get inside.

Luckily, whatever they found on me in the last hour didn‚Äôt paint me as a threat. The wall fell inwards, forming a narrow but clear path for me to walk through. I spotted my sack of coins as I walked further into the wall. Another trap I would have fallen for if I didn‚Äôt know this place‚Äôs tricks.

‚ÄúWelcome to the Whisper Walls,‚Äù a cloaked figure greeted me, its voice sounding identical to mine. ‚ÄúHope you shall find whatever it is that you seek.‚Äù

In this place, all names and Levels were concealed under the special charm. Still, given the kind of people that knew about the existence of this place, it was better to conceal my face just in case. A simple combination of a hood and a mask allowed me disappear among the crowd of people roaming around the city.

In Whisper Walls, there were only two ways to obtain information. You either had to buy it - and other information was the only currency here - or you had to find it on your own.

I switched to Abomination System and activated **[Duskwalking]**. As always, my mind was immediately bombarded with the screams and pictures of destruction I would cause in the future. There was little I could do about them. All I could do was concentrate on the shadows as I searched for anyone who might give me the answers I so desperately wanted.

Travelling between the shadows, I could hear everything. Assassination plots among nobles, conspiracies among  merchants, words of envy and hatred uttered between supposed friends. I spent hours jumping from one dark corner to another in search of the answers.

After hours of searching, I finally found something.

‚ÄúIs it really true?‚Äù a figure in a grey cloak asked, his excitement apparent even with the wooden bird mask obscuring his face. ‚ÄúYou know a way to cheat the System?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù the other person said with smug tone. She wore a red fish mask that contrasted with her blue robes. ‚ÄúBut what will you offer me for this information in return?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could pay you fifty gold pieces now. Another fifty if your method works.‚Äù

I whistled at the offer. Fifty gold pieces for just information was quite the offer. The woman, however, was not impressed.

‚ÄúYou know the rules. Knowledge can only be traded for knowledge,‚Äù she turned away and headed for an exit. Two more men blocked her path, however. ‚ÄúWhat do you think you are doing? You cannot take the knowledge by force either! That‚Äôs-‚Äú

‚ÄúAgainst the rules?‚Äù The cloaked figure asked mockingly. His allies restrained the woman and made her kneel. ‚ÄúPerhaps. But I am not afraid of Whisper Walls and its supposed omniscience. If it truly knew everything, it would have never let me in.‚Äù

He reached for her mask, ready to expose her face. Most likely, he wanted to remember it should she escape so that he could find this person outside Whisper Walls. 

Neither of them actually mattered to me or my plans. I didn‚Äôt recognise their voices. And our party never had to deal with someone trying to cheat the System. Whatever happened between the two in the original timeline, it didn‚Äôt seem like anything that affected me or my friends.

My goal was to avert the horrible future and save the world from Abomination System. I had to leave and resume my search for the answers. 

And yet, this is not what my friends would have wanted from me. 

‚ÄúWhat the- Hey, he grabbed the girl!‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter him!‚Äù

Breaking down the door, I carried the woman in my arms. I needed to get some distance and give her warning before making another shadow-leap.

‚ÄúI can get us out of here. But only if I use my skill,‚Äù I explained to her as the men behind started firing their own spells. ‚ÄúIt comes with a nasty side effect, though. Are you-‚Äú

I was interrupted by an orb of fire and acid exploding inches away from us.

‚ÄúJust get us out of here!‚Äù

If Abomination System was an animal, it would be salivating right now. It‚Äôs been so long since I used the skill with someone along for the ride. The only thing I could was give her a warning.

‚ÄúJust remember,‚Äù I whispered as I dragged us both into the shadows. ‚ÄúNo matter what you see or hear, none of it is real.‚Äù

As we travelled through the shadows, I could see every single horrific and painful moment in her life. 

The loss of her parents.

The abuse and ridicule she suffered as Classless.

The failures she encountered in her search for a way to end the System. 

The trip through the shadows lasted no longer than a few seconds. But by the time we stepped out of them on the other end of the city, I knew the girl almost as well as she knew herself.

I saw her entire life and its most painful moments, after all. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ in the Hells‚Ä¶ was that?!‚Äù She turned on me, her hand grabbing hold of a dagger she kept on her hip. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ What did I just see?‚Äù

And, in return, she saw mine."

Welcome to Madman‚Äôs Shifting Mines layered random dungeon encounter builder! This document serves multiple purposes which are relevant to my group‚Äôs home campaign, and I encourage anyone who likes what I have assembled, and wants to use it, to adjust it to suit your own setting.

I originally started writing this up because we there have been several times now where we have had 1-2 people absent from our 5-character group and the DM he wanted everyone to be present for large plot progression. So, I thought about how we could still play, not progress the main plot, and do something useful that also didn‚Äôt conflict with dungeons and points of interest that the DM had already put on the map. Our DM has had things for us to do every session without my little project, so I didn‚Äôt do this out of necessity.

Another thing that our group has been talking about is how we want to incorporate the crafting of magic items into our world. Personally, I think the ambiguity of ‚Äúthe materials required for crafting a magical can be found a certain percentage of the time‚Äù is a little lacking. I‚Äôm sure that is intentional so anyone can adjust crafting in their game. I chose to have the mines be a renewable source of these materials gated behind something that takes more effort than throwing heaps of gold at cities and getting what you want. These materials are in the form of ore that can be retrieved only at certain tiers of the mines. This prevents a flood of magical items and lets people who have more availability do useful, off schedule, missions that are exceptionally useful and won‚Äôt make anyone feel like they missed out on plot.

The intention is to be able to quickly prepare increasingly difficult encounters and let your players test their mettle. When we ran this, we had 3 level 3 characters and made it to layer 6 with one short rest. That last fight was a close one though!  Please take a look through what I have prepared and share your thoughts on aspects you like, would improve, or omit. Enjoy!

**Layers and Minerals**

The mines are organized by CR. Layer 1 has a CR 1 encounter, layer 2 CR 2 and so on. Layers 1-4 are Tier 1, 5-8 Tier 2, 9-12 Tier 3, 13-16 Tier 4, and 17-20 Tier 5. Each Tier yields a unique mineral that is required to craft magic items. Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary follow the Tier 1-5 progression. Five ore can be refined into one unit of the corresponding mineral. Each rarity of item requires 10 units on the mineral from its tier and 10 units of minerals from each tier below the rarity of the item.


Column A | Column B | Column C | Column A | Column B | Column C
---------|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------
Layer|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
CR|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
Tier|1|2|3|4|5 
Rarity|Common|Uncommon|Rare|Very Rare|Legendary
Mineral|Phoscarnet|Thiazide|Cystine|Irudin|Conazonium

¬†

Once a layer has been cleared, the party can gather 1d4 ore of the type corresponding with the tier they are on. Mining takes 30 minutes of work and requires everyone to participate. A layer that has been mined cannot be mined again until the next dawn. Every 30 minutes spent on a layer there is a cumulative chance of an incursion. 30 minutes after combat roll 1d4 and on a 1 roll only on the monster table and those creatures arrive to claim the ore. If there is no incursion, after the next 30 minutes spent on that layer roll again and on a 1 or 2 there will be an incursion and so on. If this is too much of a drain on your party, change the incursion rate to 60 minutes or lower the % chance by rolling a d6 instead of a d4. If there is an incursion, the chance drops back down to triggering on a 1. You could also omit the incursions to keep things moving.

In our game, finding the recipe for a magic item is an ordeal as well. There is a place where ancient runes line the walls, and you need to start deciphering and transcribing them. I have two methods in mind and our group haven‚Äôt even gotten close to needing rules for this, so we haven‚Äôt decided yet.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† An Arcana check elicits the rarity of the item you have discovered the blueprint. Common (DC 12) Uncommon (DC 16) Rare (DC 20) Very Rare (DC 24) Legendary (DC 28)

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Arcana check determines the loot table you roll on. (DC 14) table B, (DC 16) table C, (DC 18) table D, (DC 20) table E, (DC 22) table F, (DC 24) table G, (DC 26) table H, (DC 28) table I.

¬†When you roll, you can also choose any rarity from a threshold you‚Äôve surpassed. I.E. On a roll of 21, you could choose table B, C, D, or E to roll on. Deciphering/Transcribing takes 8 hours of work but then that item is available to be crafted. Any crafting rules for that item still apply. ¬†

The layers may have traps or hazards. The DC for an effect from the layer is 12 plus one half of the layer rounded down. If an effect deals damage, roll a number of d6‚Äôs equal to the tier. ¬†

Table: Roll once for each aspect. The duplicate options are Intentional to increase the likelihood of those options occurring.

**Creature Types**

The creature types do not have to be all be the type rolled but that can make it easier if you are using an encounter generator. I am currently using Kobold Fight Club.

The ‚ÄúVendor‚Äù is a non-hostile entity that is in the mines in search of the ore. They have interacted with other adventurers many times and have brought some items of interest with them. In exchange for allowing them to have all the ore on this level, they will let the party buy these items from them. I recommend rolling on the magic items loot table appropriate for the layer they are on. (I.E. a vendor on layer 8 would have the magic items found in a CR 8 Treasure Hoard.) I suggest if you roll on the Treasure table and there are no magic items in that range, roll again on the next lower CR range table. The gold cost for these items should be appropriately high so your party would likely only be able to afford one or two.¬† ¬†¬†

**Difficulty**

The layer that you are on governs the CR of the encounter calculations. The result rolled on the difficulty table tells you how easily a party of that CR would fare. For example, if you are on layer 10 and get a Deadly result on the difficulty roll, your encounter would be ‚ÄúDeadly‚Äù for a group of 4 level 10 adventurers. Conversely, ‚Äúminions‚Äù all have 1 health each and basically gives your players a freebie layer. Your party will likely surpass their level range and move to higher CR layers quickly so make sure they‚Äôre aware of the dangers.¬† The intention was to have a series of manageable encounters that whittle away at the party‚Äôs resources. If you want to add a boss type encounter on the last layer of a tier, then do as you see fit for your game.

**Environments**

I recommend there always be a path for a cart to be moved from the beginning to the end of each layer. This gives the party a way to haul a large amount of ore and gives them something to defend. There may be smaller side passages, but they shouldn‚Äôt lead to the next layer.

The mines and any layer traveled to are contained in a bubble-like field that blocks all travel unless you have an amulet from the keep. If you interact with the field, it will not let you pass unless you are wearing a pendant from the keep then focus and push though. A creature wearing a pendant that pushes through the field is taken back to the entrance. If a creature from the mines that is not from the players time takes a pendant from a player and attempts to exit the barrier to reach the keep is aged 400-900 years as its displacement catches up with it.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Clockwork Halls

o¬†¬† The floors are likely worked stone or metal and there are many moving gears and other mechanical parts in the walls and ceiling. A wall that is already torn away reveals a vein of ore.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Desert

o¬†¬† Sandy floors and sandstone walls are found here. The passageways were likely carved or burrowed.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Earthen

o¬†¬† Packed dirt and natural stone can be found here. Fairly moderate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Glacial

o¬†¬† These tunnels have smooth deep blue walls and howl with biting winds. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a warmer climate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gravesite

o¬†¬† This could be a tomb, catacomb, or a series of burrowed tunnels under a cemetery. Bones litter the floors and a roll of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 on the creature table are considered Undead instead of the listed type.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mining Tools

o¬†¬† This may be the closest to the original mines as it gets. There is a large, stationary, functional, mining apparatus which automatically yields 5 ore after 30 minutes instead of 1d4, with no effort from the party. ¬†Any attempt at removing the mining apparatus causes it to age rapidly and disintegrate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mossy

o¬†¬† These caves are damp and grow harmless moss.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Quarry

o¬†¬† This 40ft deep bowl-like quarry has a path around the top edge and a winding path around the inner wall leading to the bottom where the ore is found.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ravine

o¬†¬† You‚Äôre lucky the cart barely fits through this narrow craggy ravine. There is a single path through that rarely is wider than 10-15ft.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rocky

o¬†¬† These caves have been eroded by water over many years. Stalagmites, stalactites, and pools of still water are very common here.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Swamp

o¬†¬† Roots and stones are the only reason the walls don‚Äôt fall in on themselves. These muddy caves often have murky water of unknown depths.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tropical

o¬†¬† A warm breeze carries the scent of sea spray through these sandy floored rocky caves.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Underdark

o¬†¬† These dank caves are lined with unusual fungi and vegetation. Not much light can be found in these caves. It is rare even to find bioluminescent plants. Any roll of dim light on the visibility table counts as darkness and any roll of well-lit counts as dim light.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Volcanic

o¬†¬† Almost every room is glowing with red hot molten rock or filled with smoke. Any roll of darkness on the visibility table is considered heavily obscured instead. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a cooler climate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Worked Stone

o¬†¬† These halls were made to last. The floors are paved and sturdy, large pillars support the ceiling, and large open sections of the walls reveal an ore vein.

**Hazards**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Acid pits

o¬†¬† Any creature that touches the acid take Acid damage. If a creature is splashed with the acid, they can make a dexterity saving throw to take half damage on a success. ¬†¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Astral Sea

o¬†¬† This layer is adrift somewhere in the astral sea and gravity doesn‚Äôt work the same way here. There may be holes in the floor, no walls or ceiling, or other floating platforms and debris. Each creature gains a fly speed equal to 3 times their intelligence score and can hover.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Boiling Springs

o¬†¬† A steaming hot spring is nearby and is hot enough to burn you. A creature that is submerged in the water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take fire damage or half as much on a success.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Deteriorating

o¬†¬† The edges of this layer are no longer stable enough to remain. Every 15 minutes 1d4-1 squares of space (5ft) disintegrate and fall away. The path leading from entrance to the exit is the last to go.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Earthquakes

o¬†¬† The ground shakes and rumbles regularly. Each round on initiative 20, each creature that is standing on the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Creatures that are huge or larger have advantage on the save.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Jagged Crystals

o¬†¬† Sharp crystals line the walls of these caverns. Any creature that forcefully (push, shove etc.) ¬†comes into contact with the crystals must make a dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lava Hazards

o¬†¬† When a creature Enters the lava or ends it turn there it takes 10d10 fire damage. Any creature submerged in lava takes 18d10 fire damage.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mostly Underwater

o¬†¬† These caves have long been flooded and are exceptionally difficult to navigate. The path for the cart is on higher ground but anything of interest is below. Hopefully, there will be some pockets of air down there‚Ä¶

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Noxious Fumes

o¬†¬† Volatile gases seep up from cracks in the walls and floors. Any creature that gets within 5 feet of the gas must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take poison damage. If there is any fire, fire damage, or lightning damage in the space of the gas, it explodes and each creature within 10ft must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take fire damage and pushed away a number of squares(5ft) equal to the tier.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Siege Weapons

o¬†¬† There is a functional siege weapon that can be used here. A ballista, cannon, or suspended cauldron is generally appropriate for the low ceilings, but a mangonel or trebuchet may work in the quarry, astral sea, or any place you decide has large, high ceilings.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Slippery Ice

o¬†¬† The temperature is unusually low here and slick ice has formed on many surfaces here. A creature that attempts to move on the ice must make a dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Any creature that is on the ice has disadvantage against being pushed and if a creature is pushed while on the ice they go twice as far. The increased push distance ends when the ice ends.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sparking and Derelict Lab Equipment

o¬†¬† A laboratory of some sort was built here at one point, but the equipment has long been in disrepair. Electricity regularly leaps from one machine to another. (kind of like a lightning fence). A creature that moves between the two points must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or takes lightning damage and can‚Äôt take reactions until the start of their next turn.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Stunning Pseudopods

o¬†¬† Clusters of jellyfish-like, wriggling, and writhing tendrils emerge from cracks in the floor, ceiling, and walls. They have a number of hit points equal to 5 times the tier. They automatically fail all saving throws and have an AC of 5. The pseudopods immediately attack any creature that gets within 10ft of them. They have a bonus to hit equal to 3 plus twice the tier. On a hit the creature must make a constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of their next turn. A creature with resistance to poison has advantage on the saving throw and a creature that is immune to poison is not affected at all.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tar Pits

o¬†¬† Pools of thick, sticky tar dot this layer. Any creature that enters the tar or starts their turn there must make strength saving throw. On a failed save their speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn. On a success their speed becomes 5ft until the start of their net turn. Another creature may attempt to pull a creature out of the tar by making an Athletics check.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Traps

o¬†¬† Bear traps, tripwires, pressure plates, dart traps, spikes, pitfalls, you name it. Traps can be spotted with a perception or investigation check and avoided with a dexterity saving throw.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Unstable Tilting

o¬†¬† This layer is somehow detached from its surroundings and subjected to strange forces. On initiative count 20 there is a cumulative 5% chance that the entire layer will tilt. (the first roll would trigger on a 1, the second would trigger on a 1 or 2 and so on) If there is a tilt, roll a scatter die to determine the direction. (Roll a d8. On a 1 ‚Äúnorth‚Äù for the purposes of this effect is toward the DM. Subsequent numbers follow the cardinal directions clockwise. 2 is NE, 3 is E, 4 is SE, and so on.) Each creature must make a strength saving throw or they are pushed in the direction on the scatter die a number of feet equal to 5 times the tier.¬†

**Terrain**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Close Quarters

o¬†¬† There are many short winding hallways or twisting caves. Few open spaces.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Difficult

o¬†¬† For a variety of possible reasons, a significant portion of this layer has difficult terrain.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Favorable Structures

o¬†¬† There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the players to find cover behind.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Imposing Walls

o¬†¬† Large portions of this layer are entirely separated by walls. The cart path may even be the only way into the next room.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Neutral

o¬†¬† Basic flat rooms with some rocks or other thematically appropriate contents.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Unfavorable Structures

o¬†¬† There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the enemies to find cover behind.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wide Open

o¬†¬† Very little cover for anyone. This space is open and has very few side paths.

**Visibility**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dark

o¬†¬† There is no light currently in this space. There may be unlit lanterns if thematically appropriate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dimly lit

o¬†¬† There is a small amount of light here. Possibly candles, bioluminescent plants, or something else.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Heavily Obscured

o¬†¬† Fog, dust, smoke, or another airborne substance is heavily obscuring this area.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Magically dark

o¬†¬† Most, or all, of this area is blanketed in magical darkness.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Well lit

o¬†¬† There is plentiful lighting here.¬†

**Lore (from our campaign)**

After the awakening of the great slumberer, the stability of the planes has been interrupted. The abandoned mines of Cresemba (name subject to change), long protected by the keeps seal on the great beast, have become open to intrusion. The entirety of the mines had been magically locked to the point in time when the devourer was trapped so they are unstable now that it is free. These mines were heavily stripped in the past when they were in their prime, many hundreds of years ago, but some resources can still be found. The magnitude of the magic used was so great that each day the mines partially revert to the state they were in when they were time locked. However, due to the unraveling of the time binding magic, other planes bleed freely into the material plane and the mines often adopt unexpected forms. These minerals are up for grabs to anyone, from anywhere, any plane, and any when, who chooses to brave the treacherous mines.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† An Arcana check elicits the rarity of the item you have discovered the blueprint. Common (DC 12) Uncommon (DC 16) Rare (DC 20) Very Rare (DC 24) Legendary (DC 28)

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Arcana check determines the loot table you roll on. (DC 14) table B, (DC 16) table C, (DC 18) table D, (DC 20) table E, (DC 22) table F, (DC 24) table G, (DC 26) table H, (DC 28) table I.

¬†When you roll, you can also choose any rarity from a threshold you‚Äôve surpassed. I.E. On a roll of 21, you could choose table B, C, D, or E to roll on. Deciphering/Transcribing takes 8 hours of work but then that item is available to be crafted. Any crafting rules for that item still apply. ¬†

The layers may have traps or hazards. The DC for an effect from the layer is 12 plus one half of the layer rounded down. If an effect deals damage, roll a number of d6‚Äôs equal to the tier. ¬†

Table: Roll once for each aspect. The duplicate options are Intentional to increase the likelihood of those options occurring.

**Creature Types**

The creature types do not have to be all be the type rolled but that can make it easier if you are using an encounter generator. I am currently using Kobold Fight Club.

The ‚ÄúVendor‚Äù is a non-hostile entity that is in the mines in search of the ore. They have interacted with other adventurers many times and have brought some items of interest with them. In exchange for allowing them to have all the ore on this level, they will let the party buy these items from them. I recommend rolling on the magic items loot table appropriate for the layer they are on. (I.E. a vendor on layer 8 would have the magic items found in a CR 8 Treasure Hoard.) I suggest if you roll on the Treasure table and there are no magic items in that range, roll again on the next lower CR range table. The gold cost for these items should be appropriately high so your party would likely only be able to afford one or two.¬† ¬†¬†

**Difficulty**

The layer that you are on governs the CR of the encounter calculations. The result rolled on the difficulty table tells you how easily a party of that CR would fare. For example, if you are on layer 10 and get a Deadly result on the difficulty roll, your encounter would be ‚ÄúDeadly‚Äù for a group of 4 level 10 adventurers. Conversely, ‚Äúminions‚Äù all have 1 health each and basically gives your players a freebie layer. Your party will likely surpass their level range and move to higher CR layers quickly so make sure they‚Äôre aware of the dangers.¬† The intention was to have a series of manageable encounters that whittle away at the party‚Äôs resources. If you want to add a boss type encounter on the last layer of a tier, then do as you see fit for your game.

**Environments**

I recommend there always be a path for a cart to be moved from the beginning to the end of each layer. This gives the party a way to haul a large amount of ore and gives them something to defend. There may be smaller side passages, but they shouldn‚Äôt lead to the next layer.

The mines and any layer traveled to are contained in a bubble-like field that blocks all travel unless you have an amulet from the keep. If you interact with the field, it will not let you pass unless you are wearing a pendant from the keep then focus and push though. A creature wearing a pendant that pushes through the field is taken back to the entrance. If a creature from the mines that is not from the players time takes a pendant from a player and attempts to exit the barrier to reach the keep is aged 400-900 years as its displacement catches up with it.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Clockwork Halls

o¬†¬† The floors are likely worked stone or metal and there are many moving gears and other mechanical parts in the walls and ceiling. A wall that is already torn away reveals a vein of ore.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Desert

o¬†¬† Sandy floors and sandstone walls are found here. The passageways were likely carved or burrowed.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Earthen

o¬†¬† Packed dirt and natural stone can be found here. Fairly moderate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Glacial

o¬†¬† These tunnels have smooth deep blue walls and howl with biting winds. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a warmer climate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Gravesite

o¬†¬† This could be a tomb, catacomb, or a series of burrowed tunnels under a cemetery. Bones litter the floors and a roll of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 on the creature table are considered Undead instead of the listed type.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mining Tools

o¬†¬† This may be the closest to the original mines as it gets. There is a large, stationary, functional, mining apparatus which automatically yields 5 ore after 30 minutes instead of 1d4, with no effort from the party. ¬†Any attempt at removing the mining apparatus causes it to age rapidly and disintegrate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mossy

o¬†¬† These caves are damp and grow harmless moss.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Quarry

o¬†¬† This 40ft deep bowl-like quarry has a path around the top edge and a winding path around the inner wall leading to the bottom where the ore is found.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ravine

o¬†¬† You‚Äôre lucky the cart barely fits through this narrow craggy ravine. There is a single path through that rarely is wider than 10-15ft.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rocky

o¬†¬† These caves have been eroded by water over many years. Stalagmites, stalactites, and pools of still water are very common here.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Swamp

o¬†¬† Roots and stones are the only reason the walls don‚Äôt fall in on themselves. These muddy caves often have murky water of unknown depths.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tropical

o¬†¬† A warm breeze carries the scent of sea spray through these sandy floored rocky caves.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Underdark

o¬†¬† These dank caves are lined with unusual fungi and vegetation. Not much light can be found in these caves. It is rare even to find bioluminescent plants. Any roll of dim light on the visibility table counts as darkness and any roll of well-lit counts as dim light.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Volcanic

o¬†¬† Almost every room is glowing with red hot molten rock or filled with smoke. Any roll of darkness on the visibility table is considered heavily obscured instead. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a cooler climate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Worked Stone

o¬†¬† These halls were made to last. The floors are paved and sturdy, large pillars support the ceiling, and large open sections of the walls reveal an ore vein.

**Hazards**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Acid pits

o¬†¬† Any creature that touches the acid take Acid damage. If a creature is splashed with the acid, they can make a dexterity saving throw to take half damage on a success. ¬†¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Astral Sea

o¬†¬† This layer is adrift somewhere in the astral sea and gravity doesn‚Äôt work the same way here. There may be holes in the floor, no walls or ceiling, or other floating platforms and debris. Each creature gains a fly speed equal to 3 times their intelligence score and can hover.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Boiling Springs

o¬†¬† A steaming hot spring is nearby and is hot enough to burn you. A creature that is submerged in the water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take fire damage or half as much on a success.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Deteriorating

o¬†¬† The edges of this layer are no longer stable enough to remain. Every 15 minutes 1d4-1 squares of space (5ft) disintegrate and fall away. The path leading from entrance to the exit is the last to go.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Earthquakes

o¬†¬† The ground shakes and rumbles regularly. Each round on initiative 20, each creature that is standing on the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Creatures that are huge or larger have advantage on the save.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Jagged Crystals

o¬†¬† Sharp crystals line the walls of these caverns. Any creature that forcefully (push, shove etc.) ¬†comes into contact with the crystals must make a dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lava Hazards

o¬†¬† When a creature Enters the lava or ends it turn there it takes 10d10 fire damage. Any creature submerged in lava takes 18d10 fire damage.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mostly Underwater

o¬†¬† These caves have long been flooded and are exceptionally difficult to navigate. The path for the cart is on higher ground but anything of interest is below. Hopefully, there will be some pockets of air down there‚Ä¶

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Noxious Fumes

o¬†¬† Volatile gases seep up from cracks in the walls and floors. Any creature that gets within 5 feet of the gas must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take poison damage. If there is any fire, fire damage, or lightning damage in the space of the gas, it explodes and each creature within 10ft must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take fire damage and pushed away a number of squares(5ft) equal to the tier.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Siege Weapons

o¬†¬† There is a functional siege weapon that can be used here. A ballista, cannon, or suspended cauldron is generally appropriate for the low ceilings, but a mangonel or trebuchet may work in the quarry, astral sea, or any place you decide has large, high ceilings.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Slippery Ice

o¬†¬† The temperature is unusually low here and slick ice has formed on many surfaces here. A creature that attempts to move on the ice must make a dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Any creature that is on the ice has disadvantage against being pushed and if a creature is pushed while on the ice they go twice as far. The increased push distance ends when the ice ends.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sparking and Derelict Lab Equipment

o¬†¬† A laboratory of some sort was built here at one point, but the equipment has long been in disrepair. Electricity regularly leaps from one machine to another. (kind of like a lightning fence). A creature that moves between the two points must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or takes lightning damage and can‚Äôt take reactions until the start of their next turn.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Stunning Pseudopods

o¬†¬† Clusters of jellyfish-like, wriggling, and writhing tendrils emerge from cracks in the floor, ceiling, and walls. They have a number of hit points equal to 5 times the tier. They automatically fail all saving throws and have an AC of 5. The pseudopods immediately attack any creature that gets within 10ft of them. They have a bonus to hit equal to 3 plus twice the tier. On a hit the creature must make a constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of their next turn. A creature with resistance to poison has advantage on the saving throw and a creature that is immune to poison is not affected at all.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tar Pits

o¬†¬† Pools of thick, sticky tar dot this layer. Any creature that enters the tar or starts their turn there must make strength saving throw. On a failed save their speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn. On a success their speed becomes 5ft until the start of their net turn. Another creature may attempt to pull a creature out of the tar by making an Athletics check.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Traps

o¬†¬† Bear traps, tripwires, pressure plates, dart traps, spikes, pitfalls, you name it. Traps can be spotted with a perception or investigation check and avoided with a dexterity saving throw.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Unstable Tilting

o¬†¬† This layer is somehow detached from its surroundings and subjected to strange forces. On initiative count 20 there is a cumulative 5% chance that the entire layer will tilt. (the first roll would trigger on a 1, the second would trigger on a 1 or 2 and so on) If there is a tilt, roll a scatter die to determine the direction. (Roll a d8. On a 1 ‚Äúnorth‚Äù for the purposes of this effect is toward the DM. Subsequent numbers follow the cardinal directions clockwise. 2 is NE, 3 is E, 4 is SE, and so on.) Each creature must make a strength saving throw or they are pushed in the direction on the scatter die a number of feet equal to 5 times the tier.¬†

**Terrain**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Close Quarters

o¬†¬† There are many short winding hallways or twisting caves. Few open spaces.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Difficult

o¬†¬† For a variety of possible reasons, a significant portion of this layer has difficult terrain.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Favorable Structures

o¬†¬† There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the players to find cover behind.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Imposing Walls

o¬†¬† Large portions of this layer are entirely separated by walls. The cart path may even be the only way into the next room.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Neutral

o¬†¬† Basic flat rooms with some rocks or other thematically appropriate contents.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Unfavorable Structures

o¬†¬† There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the enemies to find cover behind.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wide Open

o¬†¬† Very little cover for anyone. This space is open and has very few side paths.

**Visibility**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dark

o¬†¬† There is no light currently in this space. There may be unlit lanterns if thematically appropriate.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dimly lit

o¬†¬† There is a small amount of light here. Possibly candles, bioluminescent plants, or something else.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Heavily Obscured

o¬†¬† Fog, dust, smoke, or another airborne substance is heavily obscuring this area.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Magically dark

o¬†¬† Most, or all, of this area is blanketed in magical darkness.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Well lit

o¬†¬† There is plentiful lighting here.¬†

**Lore (from our campaign)**

After the awakening of the great slumberer, the stability of the planes has been interrupted. The abandoned mines of Cresemba (name subject to change), long protected by the keeps seal on the great beast, have become open to intrusion. The entirety of the mines had been magically locked to the point in time when the devourer was trapped so they are unstable now that it is free. These mines were heavily stripped in the past when they were in their prime, many hundreds of years ago, but some resources can still be found. The magnitude of the magic used was so great that each day the mines partially revert to the state they were in when they were time locked. However, due to the unraveling of the time binding magic, other planes bleed freely into the material plane and the mines often adopt unexpected forms. These minerals are up for grabs to anyone, from anywhere, any plane, and any when, who chooses to brave the treacherous mines.

This game invites players into a magical winter night adventure, where they play as a brave beetle making its way through the snow. The game features stunning visuals, with a snowy ground contrasting beautifully against the deep blue night sky, creating a serene yet mysterious atmosphere. Players use the keyboard to control the beetle, avoiding various obstacles and traps, such as pits and suddenly appearing monsters. If the beetle falls into a trap or collides with a monster, the game ends. However, the beetle has a special ability‚Äîit can load itself into a cannon and be fired out at the right moment to leap over obstacles. Along the way, players can collect gold coins scattered along the path, which not only increase the score but also come with rich sound effects, adding much fun to the gameplay. This is a game that tests players' reaction speed and strategic planning, perfect for those who enjoy a challenge.

Which option to SKIP ?,NHLHUT,1i9l3zo,2025-01-25 06:34:22,0,0.17,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NHLHUT/comments/1i9l3zo/which_option_to_skip/,MelonCat_10,Team Advice,"I think if I grind everything + sacrifice everything then I can do 2 of these 3 options !!

I already made Mackinnon, and with the Xfactor sets Poulin would be a bit cheaper than others. I probably won't be able to afford McDavid+Makar+Hellebuyck.

(Sorry for the spam, feel free to skip the next 3 paragraphs)

Poulin/McDavid is the option I am leaning to do most. It doesn't help my team very much at all but it would be fun because I could play Poulin with fantasy Stacey and I want to play McDavid at C to feed Draisaitl 1Ts at RW (better faceoffs/endurance). Tape2Tape and Edges are awesome for McDavid to feed Draisaitl but I don't really care for Poulin's abilities that much. Even though Poulin is much more expensive, this option is more about upgrading McDavid to be a better fit for the McDraisaitl line.

Makar is the one I'm leaning to skip but I think he could actually end up being the most fun because of abilities, especially with Wheels and stuff on a Dman (it's not meta but would be fun for breakouts and stuff). He could also get some other good abilities... hopefully Yoink! or In Reverse but I doubt it. My D is already really good too with cards like ASP/Ekholm/Hedman.

Hellebuyck would be extremely helpful and fun if he got some unique abilities. No Timer is good for the D2D spamming that I hate but when I tried it on Lehner it didn't do much for D2Ds yet it made him stop some very nice 1T plays that my opponents deserved to score on, so it wasn't really doing what I wanted it to do which was stop D2Ds. I still think with better stats and the gold ability it would be an improvement on stopping D2Ds. I'm not sure what other abilities he would get, but putting some random free ones on my goalie would be fun even if they didn't activate often (I'd love the Adventurer ability but I doubt EA bothers with that). Unlike my defense, I do not have a single good goalie. If I don't go for Hellebuyck I'll get Luongo instead but he might suck at D2Ds.

Hello, over the past week, I had a water leak in the house, while the leak itself was major, nothing worth mentioning got damaged **MANGA IS SAFE,** the leak turned out to be the fault of the city, so looks like the major expenses will be covered etc... however, there are some stuff that aren't covered, and some expenses that were unforeseen. I was already doing a purge, so most of what is posted here was up for sale before, I did however pull out a few more cool things that I can part with, and if need be, I might be able to squeeze out a few more things for sale... with that being said, I did lower some prices, very slightly tho, I am not going to be selling them for retail if they are pricey obviously, but the prices remain negotiable, so feel free to send me offers!

Shipping from Canada, and prices don't include shipping costs, but I am not charging actual shipping costs, meaning that I will help you eat some of the costs for shipping if the purchase warrants it, also, I do my customs info accurately to reflect what is being sent, years of experience in shipping got me to figure out a way to ship **LEGALLY** and still not have you as the receiver incur customs costs to receive the package!

Any random floppy you see listed below contains manga, thats why I have it in the first place, if you would like to know what it contains, reach out to me and ask!

DM me for better detailed pictures.

How to Plan the Perfect Princess Party in Arizona,u_Jinanlee,1i9k50k,2025-01-25 05:24:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jinanlee/comments/1i9k50k/how_to_plan_the_perfect_princess_party_in_arizona/,Jinanlee,,"A princess party is one of the most magical ways to celebrate a special occasion, whether it‚Äôs your child‚Äôs birthday, a milestone, or just a reason to create lasting memories. In Arizona, the warm climate and stunning scenery provide the perfect backdrop for a fairytale event that will have every little guest feeling like royalty. With some thoughtful planning and creative touches, you can organize a princess party that will leave everyone in awe. Here‚Äôs how to make it happen.

# 1. Choose the Right Location

Arizona‚Äôs natural beauty offers a variety of stunning venues for a princess party. You can host your celebration in a cozy backyard, a park with lush greenery, or even a venue that resembles a castle. For indoor events, transform your space into a royal ballroom with draped fabrics, fairy lights, and regal d√©cor.

If you‚Äôre planning for an outdoor event, Arizona‚Äôs sunny weather is perfect for a garden tea party or picnic-style setup. Just be sure to plan around the time of year and provide shaded areas or cooling options during the hotter months.

# 2. Select a Magical Theme

The key to any successful princess party is a well-thought-out theme. Whether your child loves a classic princess, a courageous adventurer, or a modern heroine, choosing a specific theme sets the stage for the entire event.

Decorate your party space with elements inspired by the theme, such as pastel balloons, glittering crowns, and floral arrangements. Incorporate themed tableware and signage to create a cohesive look that feels straight out of a storybook.

# 3. Send Enchanting Invitations

The magic begins with the invitations! Get creative by designing invitations that look like royal scrolls, complete with gold accents and a wax seal. Use language like ‚ÄúHear ye, hear ye!‚Äù and include details like the ‚Äúcastle location‚Äù (your venue) and ‚Äúroyal time‚Äù (party schedule).

For a more interactive approach, consider including small surprises with the invitations, such as a mini crown or a sprinkle of glitter. These little touches help build excitement for the event.

# 4. Plan Princess-Themed Activities

Keep your young guests entertained with a lineup of fun and engaging princess-themed activities. Some ideas include:

* **Royal Crafting Stations**: Let kids decorate their own crowns, tiaras, or wands using gems, glitter, and stickers.
* **Storytime with a Princess**: A magical moment where a princess reads a beloved fairytale.
* **Sing-Alongs and Dancing**: Play popular princess songs and encourage kids to sing and dance along.
* **Treasure Hunts**: Organize a scavenger hunt for hidden jewels or royal treasures around the party space.

These activities not only keep kids engaged but also make them feel like active participants in the fairytale world.

# 5. Dress the Part

Encourage guests to dress up as their favorite princesses, princes, or royal characters. Provide a dress-up corner at the party with capes, tiaras, and costume jewelry for those who don‚Äôt have their own outfits.

You can also surprise your child with their very own princess gown to wear for the day. A ‚Äúroyal coronation‚Äù moment, where your child is crowned the star of the celebration, adds an extra layer of magic to the event.

# 6. Set Up a Royal Feast

No princess party is complete without a feast fit for royalty! Keep the menu simple yet enchanting with treats like:

* **Cupcakes decorated with edible crowns or flowers**
* **‚ÄúMagic wand‚Äù pretzels dipped in chocolate and sprinkles**
* **Mini sandwiches shaped like hearts or stars**
* **Pink lemonade served in fancy cups or teacups**

If you‚Äôre hosting a tea party-style event, set up small tables with pastel tablecloths and delicate tableware. Add floral centerpieces and tiered trays of treats for an elegant royal touch.

# 7. Include a Princess Appearance

To truly bring the magic to life, consider having a princess make an appearance at the party. The excitement of meeting a princess in person will be the highlight of the event for your child and their friends.

A professional princess can lead activities like storytelling, singing, and games while making each child feel special. Be sure to capture the moment with plenty of photos of your child interacting with their favorite character.

# 8. Create a Picture-Perfect Setup

A princess party offers plenty of opportunities for adorable photos. Set up a photo booth with themed props like crowns, scepters, and royal capes. Use a castle backdrop or floral arches to make the photos look magical.

You can also capture candid moments of the children laughing, playing, and dancing. These memories will become treasured keepsakes that your family can look back on for years.

# 9. Give Out Royal Party Favors

Send your guests home with a little piece of the magic by giving out princess-themed party favors. Consider items like mini tiaras, wands, or personalized goodie bags filled with small toys, stickers, and treats.

Party favors serve as a sweet reminder of the day and leave your guests feeling like royalty.

# 10. Keep It Fun and Stress-Free

While it‚Äôs tempting to aim for perfection, the most important part of any party is ensuring everyone has a good time. Plan ahead, delegate tasks if possible, and stay flexible. With thoughtful preparation, you‚Äôll create a day that‚Äôs just as enjoyable for you as it is for your child.

# Conclusion

Planning a princess party in Arizona is an incredible way to celebrate your child‚Äôs special day while creating magical memories for everyone involved. From enchanting decorations to interactive activities and unforgettable moments with a princess, the possibilities are endless.

If you‚Äôre organizing a **princess party AZ** event, focus on the details that make your child‚Äôs dream come true. With a little creativity and a sprinkle of fairytale magic, their special day will be an enchanting success."
Met with emotional turmoil and said Nope .. I am guy2 in story.,Indiangirlsontinder,1i9jnv4,2025-01-25 04:49:02,25,0.84,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiangirlsontinder/comments/1i9jnv4/met_with_emotional_turmoil_and_said_nope_i_am/,atvt27,,"Her life is a timeline of catastrophically bad decisions, where every new chapter somehow managed to outdo the last in terms of poor judgment. Her knack for choosing the wrong men could be an Olympic sport, and she‚Äôd win gold every time.

In **2003**, She met Guy 1, fell hopelessly in love, and after six months of pining, finally mustered the courage to propose. Guy 1, being the smooth operator he was, politely said goodbye and left her clutching her broken heart like a sad rom-com heroine. Instead of moving on, she spent the next decade holding a candle for him, proving that sometimes, the light at the end of the tunnel is just an oncoming train.

By **2013**, still hopelessly stuck on Guy 1, she decided to rebound straight into marriage with Husband 1‚Äîa man who can best be described as a walking cautionary tale. They didn‚Äôt consummate their marriage, didn‚Äôt live together, and barely functioned as a couple. She moved back in with her parents on the same day she got married, while Husband 1 stayed in a PG, probably wondering what he‚Äôd gotten himself into. Unsurprisingly, their union was as fulfilling as a bag of air, with she footing the bill for the entire wedding while Husband 1 contributed absolutely nothing‚Äînot even emotional support. His greatest achievements included skipping ring shopping and bringing an IIT degree that didn‚Äôt land him a stable job. By **2018**, She had finally had enough and divorced him, effectively ending the most pointless five-year relationship in history.

But Her adventures didn‚Äôt stop there. In **2017**, during her sham of a marriage, she met Dr. Manipulative‚Äîher gynecologist, no less‚Äîwho convinced her that he was helping her ‚Äúknow herself.‚Äù Spoiler alert: he wasn‚Äôt. Using her trust and vulnerability, he took advantage under the guise of care, leaving her questioning not just him but also her life choices.

In **2019**, as if the universe hadn‚Äôt laughed enough at her expense, Guy 1 re-entered her life. This time, he was conveniently interested because his wife wasn‚Äôt around. Effectively serving as his emotional doormat, She welcomed him back, proving once again that her self-respect had gone on a permanent vacation.

By **2022**, after nearly two decades of being tethered to the emotional baggage of Guy 1, she finally managed to let go‚Äîonly to stumble right into another disaster. In **2023**, she met Guy 2, who was looking for a no-strings-attached fling. Predictably, She got emotionally attached, but Guy 2, sensing her issues, decided to bail because he didn‚Äôt want to play therapist. Now, still reeling from that rejection, She has decided to experiment with hooking up with random people to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù what FWB means. At this rate, she‚Äôll soon be eligible for a Guinness World Record in questionable life choices.

TLDR - Met a girl, her life is a journey of emotional missteps. After falling for her first love in 2003 and being rejected, she rebounded into an unfulfilling marriage in 2013, which lasted five years without intimacy or cohabitation. Post-divorce in 2018, she faced manipulation from a doctor and reconnected with her first love in 2019, only to be used again. By 2022, she moved on from him, but a new attachment in 2023 to a man uninterested in emotional baggage left her exploring casual relationships. Her story reflects the struggles of seeking validation, enduring poor choices."

"Create Unforgettable Memories with a Princess Party in Frisco, TX",u_erepresent,1i9hmg5,2025-01-25 02:15:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9hmg5/create_unforgettable_memories_with_a_princess/,erepresent,,"There‚Äôs nothing quite like the magic of a princess-themed party to make your little one‚Äôs dreams come true. Whether it‚Äôs a birthday celebration or a special gathering, hosting a princess party in Frisco, TX, is the perfect way to create unforgettable memories. From enchanting decorations to fun-filled activities, there‚Äôs so much you can do to make the day truly magical. Let‚Äôs dive into the best ideas and tips to help you plan a princess party that will leave everyone spellbound.

# 1. Choose the Perfect Theme

The first step to planning an amazing princess party is selecting a theme. While some kids love classic fairy-tale princesses, others may dream of underwater adventures, snow kingdoms, or enchanted forests.

* **Classic Fairy Tale:** Think castles, tiaras, and ballroom dances.
* **Winter Wonderland:** Inspired by icy blue and white tones with a snow-themed setup.
* **Underwater Adventure:** Perfect for mermaid-loving kids, complete with sea-themed decorations.
* **Garden Tea Party:** A charming outdoor celebration filled with flowers and tea sets.

Choosing a theme that aligns with your child‚Äôs favorite princess or fairy tale will make the celebration extra special.

# 2. Decorate Like Royalty

The right decorations can transform your venue into a magical kingdom. Use a combination of balloons, streamers, and fairy lights to create an enchanting atmosphere. Add themed elements like castles, carriages, or enchanted forests to bring the story to life.

* **Color Palette:** Stick to soft pastels, glittering golds, or icy blues, depending on the theme.
* **Photo Backdrop:** Set up a royal photo booth with props like crowns, wands, and capes.
* **Royal Table Settings:** Use sparkly tablecloths, themed plates, and napkins to add a royal touch.

Whether you‚Äôre hosting at home or renting a venue in Frisco, creative decorations will make the event feel magical.

# 3. Invite a Princess Performer

One of the most magical additions to a princess party is having a real-life princess attend. Professional princess performers can captivate the kids with their charm, storytelling, and songs. They‚Äôre experts at engaging children, making them feel like they‚Äôve stepped into a fairy tale.

From coronation ceremonies to sing-alongs, these performers can entertain the children with a variety of activities. Plus, the chance to meet their favorite princess in person will be a memory your child treasures forever.

# 4. Plan Fun and Interactive Activities

A great princess party is all about keeping the kids engaged and entertained. Here are some activity ideas to consider:

* **Princess Crafts:** Let the kids decorate tiaras, wands, or bracelets with glitter, jewels, and ribbons.
* **Storytime:** Have a princess read a magical tale to the children.
* **Dance Party:** Play iconic princess songs and let the kids show off their royal dance moves.
* **Treasure Hunt:** Create a scavenger hunt with ‚Äúroyal treasures‚Äù hidden around the venue.

These activities will keep the kids entertained while also giving them fun keepsakes to take home.

# 5. Serve a Magical Feast

No party is complete without delicious treats, and a princess party is no exception. Create a menu that ties into the theme, combining tasty snacks with royal presentation.

* **Themed Cupcakes:** Decorate cupcakes with edible glitter, crowns, or princess toppers.
* **Royal Sandwiches:** Use cookie cutters to create crown-shaped finger sandwiches.
* **Fruit Wands:** Skewer fresh fruit on sticks to resemble magical wands.
* **Princess Punch:** Serve colorful drinks in clear cups with sugar-rimmed edges.

A beautifully decorated cake featuring castles, tiaras, or the birthday child‚Äôs favorite princess will be the centerpiece of the celebration.

# 6. Provide Memorable Party Favors

Send your guests home with magical party favors that reflect the theme. Fill goody bags with items like mini crowns, wands, stickers, or bracelets. You could even include personalized thank-you notes to make each child feel special.

These thoughtful touches will leave a lasting impression and remind the kids of the magical day they had.

# 7. Capture the Magic

Don‚Äôt forget to document the special moments! Designate a family member or hire a photographer to take pictures throughout the event. Set up a photo booth with a princess-themed backdrop and props so guests can pose for fun pictures.

These photos will serve as beautiful memories of your child‚Äôs special day and can be shared with friends and family.

# 8. Consider Frisco‚Äôs Fantastic Venues

Frisco, TX, is home to several family-friendly venues that can perfectly accommodate your princess party. Whether you choose a spacious park for an outdoor tea party or a cozy indoor venue for a winter wonderland theme, Frisco has plenty of options to fit your needs.

Hosting the party at a local venue can also make planning easier, as many locations offer rental packages that include decorations and entertainment options.

# Final Thoughts

A princess party in Frisco, TX, is the perfect way to celebrate your little one‚Äôs special day. From choosing a magical theme to planning fun activities and hiring a talented princess performer, there are endless ways to create an unforgettable experience. With the right touches and a little creativity, you can bring your child‚Äôs fairy-tale dreams to life and make memories that will last a lifetime.

So, whether you‚Äôre hosting at home or at one of the city‚Äôs fantastic venues, get ready to make your child feel like royalty with a **princess Frisco TX** celebration they‚Äôll never forget."

I‚Äôm from the Philippines, looking for someone to share life‚Äôs adventures with.

A bit about me: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2"", slim, with brown skin and dark hair. I also have a tattoo on my arm (because, why not?).

People say I look intimidating at first, mostly because I don‚Äôt smile or talk much. Blame it on my RBF and being introverted. But once I‚Äôm comfortable, you‚Äôll wish I was quieter, because I‚Äôll never stop talking or cracking jokes.

Fair warning though, if English is your first language, don‚Äôt expect comedy gold‚ÄîI‚Äôll be struggling to find the right words in English, since it‚Äôs not my first language. So, don‚Äôt be too harsh on my attempts at humor! üòÇ

I‚Äôm family-oriented, and I hope you are too. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs kind, respectful, and, of course, funny. If you like physical touch (that‚Äôs my love language), we‚Äôre off to a good start. Also, cooking is another way I show love, so hope you‚Äôre into that!

So you wanna‚Ä¶ | A Guide to Wyvernheart,Anbennar,1i9da8j,2025-01-24 21:50:01,136,0.99,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anbennar/comments/1i9da8j/so_you_wanna_a_guide_to_wyvernheart/,PotatoeChisps,Other,"***So you wanna turn orcs into hideous abominations.***

Wyvernheart‚Äôs your country.

Starting in the region of Escann, Brave Brothers begins amidst the end of the Greentide as an adventurer band originating from the town of Trunaire in the country of Verne.

Their formation into the country of Wyvernheart brings conflict and darkness to Escann. Forcible assimilation of other ethnicities under their culture, the experimentation and transformation of orcs and goblins into shock troops and a government focused entirely on the superiority of magic. If you like the idea of making all of Escann into one culture, specialized mercenary companies consisting of orcs with various body parts attached to them and building up to the mage supremacist nation of the Black Demesne, Wyvernheart‚Äôs your country.

Pros:

* Guaranteed Mage Rulers
* Many, many mission events which give amazing lore and content
* **Orcish abominations:** Unique mercenary companies (which grow stronger overtime)
* Unique government with powers (Replenish manpower, temporary countrywide buffs, levelling a random magic school)
* Strong economy (Religious culture bonus, increased tax, production and manpower)
* Amazing synergy and flow into forming Black Demesne (competing with Covenblad)
* One of the coolest characters in the mod through sheer **aura.**¬†
* Magical supremacy
* >!A very short and simple disaster!!<

Cons:

* Culture conversion focus, be prepared for it to take 20+ years to complete two missions (respectively, so 40+ for both)
* Slow early-game (need a lot of money, and quite a bit of conquest)
* Tiny bit RNG dependent (mostly for the mission needing two legendary magics, your ruler might die before you reach it. Mine certainly did. Twice.)
* Missions can be **infuriating** (eg; culture converting 3 areas with a +25% conversion time, needing two specific legendary magics, needing -5 diplo rep, build a mage tower with 6 manpower in every state of Inner Castanor, West Alenic Frontier and Central Alenic Reach, culture converting the entirety of West, Inner and South Castanor‚Ä¶)
* Merc focus (An EU4 problem, not a Wyvernheart problem), be prepared to repeatedly reattach cannons when your troops get exiled and utilize number keys to manage troops, (ctrl + number)

# Author‚Äôs Note

This is meant to be a sort of country guide + review. This probably is going to be different from other walkthroughs, less of a step by step and more of my personal experiences and advice. Small spoilers ahead, I‚Äôm not going to be spoiling every event or mission, but I‚Äôm putting this warning just in case, cause I‚Äôll be showing pictures of things ingame.

I played this campaign using many other sub-mods; monuments, xorme ai, responsible blobbing and warfare, more idea groups slots‚Ä¶ as well as using quite a lot of save scumming. This isn‚Äôt going to translate exactly as in the base game, but I hope parts of it still help. I‚Äôm just saying this in case something different happens and I can‚Äôt really help with it.

# National Ideas

[Courtesy of the Anbennar Wiki. Check it out at https:\/\/wiki.anbennar.org\/Anbennar\_Wiki.](https://preview.redd.it/wjc9zny4w1fe1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=1513547ff51e64b0436b826485fffd99b5e89532)

Wyvernheart‚Äôs ideas are honestly just okay? They have good ideas like +10% morale, +1 land leader fire and maneuver, -10% advisor cost. But nothing really that unique.¬†

¬†Wyvernheart leans towards‚Ä¶

* Increased mana efficiency through cheaper advisors, tech cost and a free military policy
* Winning wars through better leaders, morale and land fire damage
* Governing and assimilating their land as their own with autonomy change and tax.
* Showing the superiority of their culture and their ruler through‚Ä¶ prestige and legitimacy? (I think?)

To make their ideas more unique, I would have traded better leaders and morale for insane amounts of fire and shock damage as well as mercenary bonuses to highlight their Burnbloods. I would also add some culture conversion cost in there but that‚Äôs my opinion. Let‚Äôs get to the actual gameplay.

# Opening

I‚Äôm only going to get into Wyvernheart after you finish the adventurer opening with migration and federations. There are already a ton of other guides for that. I will say, decide if you‚Äôre going to focus on the west or the east when consolidating tribal land. You need the west for your mission tree and the more you have of it, the easier of a time you‚Äôll have after forming Wyvernheart, but you also should grab Castanor before anyone else.

So you formed Wyvernheart, what‚Äôs the first thing to do?

https://preview.redd.it/jftn87a9w1fe1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=633f3517cc90af6500f3ccaeae13df3a3c91781e

Well, you‚Äôre going to be having a rough early-game. The opening I primarily split into two parts. The left is focused on the conquest and development of West Castanor. The right focuses on estates and building mage towers (and warring with Vrorenmarch but that‚Äôs for later). It‚Äôs going to take quite a bit of money, quite a bit of building and quite a bit of conquest before you can truly become ‚ÄúWyvernheart‚Äù, which occurs around the mission ‚ÄúA Beast Unlike Any Other‚Äù. Let‚Äôs check the left side first.

# Left Side (Annex West Castanor):

You need to conquer a significant chunk of West Castanor, and this will lead to warring against the likes of Nurcestir, Alenor, Elikhand, Luciande, and if you‚Äôre unlucky, Ibevar. They‚Äôll probably have allies, so you‚Äôre gonna need to use mercs to even the playing field. Look out for other Escanni nations who lost land as they probably have many cores you can use to reconquer for little AE. I had around five escanni vassals over the course of my consolidation.

As you annex your fellow Escanni countries, Ibevar may or may not decide to conquer Escann from the west. If they do, you gotta deal with a country with higher discipline and morale than you, and when I fought them they also had a war wizard.¬†

If that happens, maybe you should hold off on that and wait until they enter a war.

[Marrhold and Blademarch alliance to the East. Super strong Ibevar to the West. This is just great.](https://preview.redd.it/f79muiyaw1fe1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bfb904c5769f3e86880154bcdf301959b680d4c)

After you conquer west castanor, you‚Äôre gonna need to build it up afterwards. Workshops to complete ‚Äúweapons of adventure‚Äù and forts to complete ‚ÄúThe hunter in the woods‚Äù. However, the rewards for these aren‚Äôt super powerful and you don‚Äôt need to complete these in the beginning to get your power-spike. I finished these missions around the late 1500‚Äôs to progress the left side of the mission tree as I was focusing more on consolidating Escann to skip the wars of consolidation as well as the right side of the mission tree.

So you‚Äôre at peace, maybe you got truces on everyone in the west. Maybe you‚Äôre waiting for the perfect moment to attack Ibevar. Let‚Äôs move to the right side of the mission tree.

# Right Side (Estate management + Mage towers):

The first couple missions involve playing around with the adventure and mage estate. Pretty simple, although the mage mission will cost a bit of gold and 1 stability.

After that?

To continue, you‚Äôre going to need to build around 3 mage towers in key provinces to progress. This is a bit of a pain. They cost 400 each and you‚Äôre not exactly strapped for cash in the early game. You also are going to need to conquer the provinces to be able to complete the missions in the first place.¬†

You also, also get missions to conquer Vrorenmarch but honestly, I‚Äôd save it for later. Vrorenmarch tends to be pretty strong compared to the Escanni nations, so I‚Äôd focus on Escann first.

It took me a bit to finish the needed missions for ‚ÄúA Beast Unlike Any Other‚Äù, around 1520. A powerful Ibevar blocked me from completing ‚ÄúDescend upon the Alen‚Äù but as mentioned, you can save dealing with ‚ÄúWeapons of Adventure‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Hunter in the Woods‚Äù for later.

The progress probably would look something like: Right side + Central (estates) -> Left side (conquer west) -> Right side (mage towers, 5 years needed to unlock ‚ÄúA Beast Unlike Any Other‚Äù) -> At your own pace

So you finally completed ‚ÄúA Beast Unlike Any Other‚Äù. This begins the start of something truly great.

# Burnbloods

**‚ÄúBy the time the blood loss from being disemboweled felled the thing, it had long since pried the werewolf‚Äôs head from its body.‚Äù**

https://preview.redd.it/uru6b6cdw1fe1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=66fe7d90fb6cfdcd13db4ef916288c5216a39f3e

The main reason you‚Äôre playing Wyvernheart. Burnbloods are a monstrous amalgamation of orcs, goblins and half-orcs. In-game, they act as a unique mercenary company with a set of modifiers, which upgrades itself as you progress through the mission tree. They also don‚Äôt cost any professionalism to hire (but you‚Äôre most likely going for merc ideas, so it‚Äôs more of a nice early-game touch.)

Initially you start with just one army. A single army of 20 infantry and nothing else. They also aren‚Äôt exactly the super power spike yet which allows you to snowball. They start with -25% reinforce cost and +10% shock damage but as a downside, have +25% shock damage taken. They are going to do a lot of damage but take a lot of damage and honestly, they‚Äôre kind of just an extra mercenary company. The first time I used them, they ran out of manpower in two decently large battles.

¬†Over time however, these modifiers get stronger and stronger and you eventually get four of these armies, fit with a complete combat width of both infantry and artillery. They further get improved with a loyal adventurer‚Äôs estate, giving extra discipline (High adventurer influence gives you +10% merc discipline) and they become ridiculous with mercenary ideas, which you should 100% grab. Remember to attach some cannons to your Burnbloods using the attach button on the right. Also remember that you can set a number to the army by doing ctrl + ‚Äúnumber‚Äù.

[For comparison, my entire manpower pool is 172k in 1688. This is the second-final version to the Burnbloods.](https://preview.redd.it/1ivf7yqgw1fe1.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b27fdc1fb93a9ca9d2e5b75dbc4960a6713ebbf)

The mission events upgrading your Burnblood are also some of my favourites in the entire mod. They showcase the absolute insanity which is Wyvernheart as a country. I originally thought Wyvernheart was going to be based on taming wyverns. I now see that I was terribly misled.

[They do use Wyverns, just not in the way I expected.](https://preview.redd.it/mlyctsbjw1fe1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7fc5dead8d741b06d4fdeda54bb6349969035b6)

# Exploit

Now, this is all well and good. But let‚Äôs be honest. Four companies is nice, but is pretty much a drop in the bucket in the late game. You‚Äôre going to be fielding around 1 million troops and an extra 300k in mercenaries is nice, but not enough (this is why I use responsible warfare).

You‚Äôre probably going to have to hire some other mercenaries, and deal with their odd and unusual unit compositions, and it is not fun.

[Why an odd number of infantry and cannons??](https://preview.redd.it/zlntwu0mw1fe1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9820cac5b6ee348495cef7370a3c2fc9e52590f2)

However, there‚Äôs an easy exploit which takes two seconds. You don‚Äôt have to do it, but I honestly recommend it for the fun and roleplay of having an army entirely of Burnbloods.

Whenever you complete a mission to upgrade your Burnbloods, they will get disbanded and a portion of the cost refunded to you. The Burnbloods will then be replaced a couple days later by a newly updated set of Burnbloods, complete with new modifiers.

Emphasis on a **couple days later.**

You can still hire the burnbloods before they get replaced, and you‚Äôll continue to keep them after it updates. You can then buy the newly updated burnbloods, increasing your total.

[If you want to know, the last number is 13](https://preview.redd.it/bvplywuow1fe1.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=63df2dc921f2448800b3ebf9eaa2bfb28b74aafd)

If the older burnblood gets stackwiped, you won‚Äôt be able to get it back, so keep them safe. I didn‚Äôt discover this exploit until much later, so I was only able to get around 13 total Burnblood companies. The actual number should be around 15 or 17? The Burnbloods also will have different modifiers, regiments and manpower depending on their ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù, so use the newer ones for war and the older ones to manage and defend your territory.

# Floodborn

The Burnbloods are amazing, but what I‚Äôd consider Wyvernheart‚Äôs true increase in power is after the Crimson Deluge and the formation of the Floodborn Council.

https://preview.redd.it/e9zqwzktw1fe1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=faf122d9b4fce62924342750aba00c8d0a1ca884

To perform government actions, you need ‚ÄúBloodbrand‚Äù which you get overtime rather quickly, even when you first get it. You have three actions which are all incredibly powerful. You will also gather bloodbrand faster by building mage towers, making your mages more loyal or following your mission tree. Bloodbrand is incredibly easy to gather, so don't be afraid to spam powers. Using powers also makes your mage estate more loyal and also gives a tiny bit of crownland (2%?).¬†

[Side note: You also get some modifiers the more bloodbrand you have. These aren‚Äôt really amazing so you may just want to burn bloodbrand to get rid of the unrest.¬†](https://preview.redd.it/iwixyqb0x1fe1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efbbacee33402957b7d0ae3cbb9c07a257145c2)

# Brand New Burnbloods:

**Regenerates up to 25% of the manpower for EVERY burnblood company currently active. 30 Bloodbrand.**

https://preview.redd.it/ymjip3i3x1fe1.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fdc7374330762f6574d9b49b22728fff14db18

This is a large reason why Burnbloods are so powerful, because at one usage a year, you can refill your entire manpower supply in four years. With the exploit mentioned, you regenerate hundreds of thousands of manpower every year. This also stacks with the 30% increased manpower capacity from mercenary ideas, getting you even more manpower per Burnblood. This basically allows you to throw Burnbloods into difficult fights to drain the manpower of other countries, retreating when your cannons start to take damage and get all of it back for the low cost of 30 bloodbrand. Who needs Quantity?

Side Note: It also allows you to core one annexed province for the cost of 3 development. I don‚Äôt do it, but the option is there.

# Imbue a New Overseer:¬†

**Promote an Overseer to manage a region, providing buffs and giving a very strong general (with 7+ shock). 60 Bloodbrand.**

https://preview.redd.it/0jrpu3x4x1fe1.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da1b360b2e5fc0f26a831b1cd3809a23b428fb1

The most unique option out of the 3. You can have up to six of them for every region you own a part of (I think you only need a part and you don‚Äôt need to own the whole thing?). There are six overseers to choose from which give their own buff to both the country and the region it governs, like lowering rebel progress, years of separatism, providing mercantilism or missionary strength.

The strongest one is probably the overseer giving +5% discipline in exchange for less monthly bloodbrand. You get bloodbrand back so quickly so feel free to place down as many overseers as you can.

# The Flood:

>!**Pre-Disaster:**!< **Turns your ruler/heir into a mage in exchange for 1 in every monarch stat**

>!**Post-Disaster:**!< **Pick a random school of magic and increase it by 1 level. School of magic stays until reaching legendary. If all schools are legendary, level up 1 random monarch stat.**

Absolutely busted and compensates for you not using Liches. You can legendary schools of magic from proficiency in less than 10 years. However, if it lands on a weaker school like necromancy or Illusion, you‚Äôre going to have to legendary the school to change it, as the school carries over after ruler death. Late-game when you‚Äôre almost done with your mission-tree, you‚Äôll be able to use this in less than 2 years. Also is amazing in Black Demesne when you‚Äôre gonna need as much magic as you can.

# Culture Conversion

Wyvernheart has a very large emphasis on culture conversion. One of their early-mid missions make them physically unable to accept other cultures with a -99 accepted culture slots debuff, in exchange for a -10 years of separation buff. They later get a unique version of the Clergy Privilege ‚ÄúReligious Culture‚Äù, called ‚ÄúCulture of the Heart‚Äù giving double the bonuses that Religious Culture gives in provinces with Wyvernheart culture (-2 unrest, +20% tax, production and manpower). It also provides a province modifier in every province with the wrong culture, giving +5 unrest in exchange for a 33% culture conversion cost and **TIME.**¬†

https://preview.redd.it/axf2v4ldx1fe1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c323cbaf2b5838633dc451969ddba03b348c0c8

This gives Wyvernheart a sizable economic boost in their main provinces which only increases the more you convert other cultures. This also further stacks with Religious Culture for a total of -3 unrest and +30% tax, production and manpower in applicable provinces. Remember that you can‚Äôt culture convert provinces that are not your religion, so grab religious and culture convert everything you get your hands on. You‚Äôre going to need it for some of your missions.

# Ideas

There are two idea combinations you could pick up in the beginning.

Diplomatic, Administrative and Offensive: One of the safest openings for just about any nation. Diplomatic to help prevent coalitions + take more land, Admin to core faster and Offensive to siege faster and win wars faster.

Influence, Religious and Mercenaries: Actually a really strong combination for Wyvernheart. Religious is necessary for all the culture conversion you‚Äôre going to be doing. Influence is a really nice idea group and you‚Äôre going to need it as a Witch King if you ever use vassals. Mercenary further improves your Burnbloods. Every idea group also gives a policy with each other for three across every group.

* Influence + Mercenary gives a +50% vassal force limit contribution and the ability to use **client states early**
* Religious + Influence gives -15% culture conversion cost
* Mercenary + Religious gives +2% missionary strength and +10% morale

In order of priority:

**Necessary:**

* Influence: 100% needed if you want any hope of integrating vassals as a witch king. Also good to have when you form Black Demesne to help deal with acolytes. Escann is a battleground and you can grab/release vassals with a ton of reconquest cores. You can also get client states super early with mercenary which is cool. -15% culture cost when paired with Religious for -40% culture conversion cost total
* Religious: You‚Äôre going to be going Corinite (or Infernal Court), and you can‚Äôt culture convert provinces until you change them to your religion. Also gives you -25% culture conversion cost saving you hundreds in diplo mana by the time you finish your mission tree. Also also, Deus Vult!

**Amazing:**

* Administrative: If you want to skip the Escanni wars of consolidation, you‚Äôre going to want Administrative for the -25% core reduction. Also pairs amazingly with Influence for an additional -15% vassal integration cost and with Mercenary for -20% mercenary maintenance.
* Mercenary: This is just to make your burnbloods as strong and useful as possible. You‚Äôll probably be using other mercenaries as your actual army so this further helps, making purchasing them cheaper, lowering their maintenance and giving them large amounts of manpower almost like a bootleg quantity. Also gives some bonuses like 10% infantry combat ability and 5% discipline for all your mercenaries.
* Offensive: Simple and powerful military group. Better leaders, 20% siege ability, 5% discipline‚Ä¶ Offensive is just amazing.

**Good:**

* Infrastructure: The later parts of the mission tree require you to develop quite a few provinces. Dev cost will save you some mana, but Infrastructure is also just a nice group to have.
* Diplomatic: Lots of diplomats and improved relations for cutting down coalitions, +2 diplo rep to further help when you‚Äôre hit with that -6 diplo rep penalty from the witch king and -20% warscore cost is nice to have.¬†
* Trade: Money. You‚Äôre going to conquer up to Bay of Chills and all the trade nodes in Escann are gonna lead up to it. You want money, you grab trade.

**Bad:**

* Quantity: You already should be getting Mercenary ideas which gives 30% mercenary manpower. Sure, you could field more infantry and cannons if you need to but Quantity just seems redundant. Force limit wise, just hire more mercenaries to fight stronger countries.

# Corinite or Infernal Court

Canonically in the lore, Wyvernheart goes Corinite but if you‚Äôre going to go Infernal, it would be best to go early while you‚Äôre still an adventurer.

At their most useful, Corinite gives access to a permanent 10% morale and holy orders. Infernal Court gives access to more versatility through its regent court mechanics, very strong modifiers if you have negative personality traits, deus vult and -15% war score cost against **everyone.** (Corinite has this too but a lot of countries will also go Corinite) The most useful god, is probably Hedine who gives you +2 diplo rep, because you‚Äôre going to need all the diplo reputation you can get when you become a Witch King.

Corinite however is also worth considering due to its holy order ‚ÄúOrder of the Orchard‚Äù, which reduces culture conversion cost and **time** by 25%.

If you‚Äôre annexing and coring everything on your own, go with Corinite. If you heavily utilize integrating vassals, go Infernal Court.

Corinite probably will allow you to finish your mission tree faster with its faster culture conversion, but Infernal Court is probably stronger in general with Deus Vult, its 15% war score cost against everyone and versatile line up of gods (but you're just going to pick Hedine)

# Undead Army?

No.

While the roleplay potential is cool (undead orc abominations, anyone?), undead army is actively detrimental to your Burnblood companies.

* \-25% mercenary manpower
   * Directly ruins the Burnblood‚Äôs ability to repeatedly enter battles for little manpower cost. Almost cancels out the manpower bonus from Mercenary ideas.
* \-30% fire and shock damage
   * Basically turns the Burnblood‚Äôs into regular troops. Cancels out their fire and shock modifiers and probably even drops it into the negatives
* \-40% movement speed
   * I don‚Äôt think I have to explain this one.

Force limit and increased manpower isn‚Äôt that helpful for Wyvernheart. The insane amounts of morale is nice but your Burnbloods already win fights through sheer amounts of fire and shock damage, and you lack the ability to keep piling on wave after wave of burnbloods to win fights. Do yourself a favor, and don‚Äôt grab undead army.

# Afterwards

So you made it through your mission tree. It‚Äôs probably around the mid-1500's. You got your burnbloods and a mercenary army, you got your floodborn council, you‚Äôre one of the strongest powers in Escann. Good job! From here on out, you can probably figure out what to do next. But here are some goals to push towards in case you‚Äôre lost.

* Push into Gawed
* Consolidate Escann
* Annex the Bay of Chills and move your main trade city there
* Culture converting every province you own
* >!Deal with your disaster (It should only take a year!)!<

# Review and Conclusion

I hope this helps out anyone looking to do a Wyvernheart game or at least thinking about doing one. This is by far my longest Anbennar campaign ever and is probably going near the end to finish the Black Demesne mission tree.

Overall, Wyvernheart‚Äôs probably my second favourite campaign of all time. Despite the infuriating missions and the wonky mercenary focus, the events and lore were a blast, utilizing magic was great (divination is now officially my most beloved school) and I loved how things got more and more disturbing as the mission tree progressed.

Wyvernheart gets an 8.5/10. Thank you for reading and remember to make sure a lot of orcs have a **very** bad time. Long live the Sovereign! May only the strongest rule!"

Top 5 Themes for Frisco Princess Parties,u_erepresent,1i99zcw,2025-01-24 19:03:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i99zcw/top_5_themes_for_frisco_princess_parties/,erepresent,,"Planning a princess party in Frisco, Texas, is an exciting opportunity to bring a magical fairy-tale experience to life. With so many creative themes to choose from, you can tailor the celebration to perfectly match the birthday child‚Äôs favorite princess or magical world.

# 1. Classic Fairy-Tale Princess Theme

# 2. Underwater Princess Adventure

If your little one dreams of life under the sea, an underwater princess theme is the way to go. This magical ocean-inspired party allows kids to dive into a world of mermaids and aquatic wonders.

* **Decor:** Think blue, teal, and purple color schemes with shimmery fabrics to mimic the ocean. Add seashells, starfish, and sparkling lights to create an underwater vibe.

* **Food:** Serve blue punch, sea-themed cupcakes, and ‚Äúfish-shaped‚Äù snacks. Include a cake decorated with seashells, coral, and a mermaid tail for the perfect finishing touch.

This theme is especially popular during the summer months and is great for poolside parties.

# 3. Winter Wonderland Princess Party

For a cool and magical experience, a winter wonderland princess party is a dazzling choice. Perfect for colder seasons or air-conditioned venues, this theme brings the icy beauty of a snow kingdom to life.

I recut Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen into a unified album,RedHotChiliPeppers,1i99yno,2025-01-24 19:02:24,0,0.4,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedHotChiliPeppers/comments/1i99yno/i_recut_unlimited_love_and_return_of_the_dream/,TanTanner,[DISCUSSION],"# [Link here.](https://youtu.be/84FkJSvS_20?si=fOxwhpEBnZiwI_ij)

Tl;dr This isn‚Äôt a playlist. I edited almost every song and remixed the songs from the last two songs into a more cohesive conceptual album. There are hundreds of edits across the album!

Lately, I've been inspired to reimagine and merge Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen into a single album. There are some elements across all these songs whether musically, lyrically, or thematically that got me thinking more and more about turning this idea into a full project. When apart, these albums' tracks are generally standalone, but this project sought to splice and regroup songs into a more cohesive package. I've always been an album guy over individual songs, and that was my goal with this project! It's my first time doing something like this, so above all else, at least I had fun.

To achieve this, I mostly edited intros/outros and tried to let certain parts breathe a bit more. The songs have mostly been de-""single""-ized

Let's look at the albums three sections and track list (in order):

**Part 1 - Awakening (Tracks 1-9)**  
La La La La La La La La \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Black Summer \[Unlimited Love\]  
Poster Child \[Unlimited Love\]  
Shoot Me a Smile \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Aquatic Mouth Dance \[Unlimited Love\]  
The Great Apes \[Unlimited Love\]  
Tippa My Tongue \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
These are the Ways \[Unlimited Love\]  
Reach Out \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]

**Part 2 - Falling (Tracks 10-18)**  
Copperbelly \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
White Braids and Pillow Chair \[Unlimited Love\]  
Here Ever After \[Unlimited Love\]  
It's Only Natural \[Unlimited Love\]  
She's a Lover \[Unlimited Love\]  
Handful \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Peace and Love \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Bella \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Fake as Fu@k \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]

**Part 3 - Alone (Tracks 19-27)**  
Nerve Flip \[Unlimited Love B-Side\]  
Afterlife \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Eddie \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
The Drummer \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Bag of Grins \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
Whatchu Thinkin \[Unlimited Love\]  
The Heavy Wing \[Unlimited Love\]  
Carry Me Home \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]  
In the Snow \[Return of the Dream Canteen\]

**Cutting room floor**  
**From Unlimited Love:**  
Not the One  
Bastards of Light  
One Way Traffic  
Veronica  
Let 'Em Cry

**From Return of the Dream Canteen:**  
Roulette  
My Cigarette

Just because a song got cut doesn't mean it's bad (TBF IMO the only decent song that got cut is My Cigarette), but more so didn't fit the vision for the album I had in mind. That also means a song that made the album isn't necessarily a great song on its own but fits the concept nicely.

I won't go track by track but I'll give a condensed album liner summary to get buy in for the loose concept. Think of this album as being from someone's perspective in journey. For good measure, let's imagine our character's name is Tony Flow.

Track 1. (La La La La La La La La)  
I'm sure some people will be turned off by such an unpopular song being the opener. Well, this song's atmosphere is lovely, but I cut out most of the ""filler"" parts of this song. It's the opener to establish that Tony is in a dream like state. By the end of the song, he's ""waking up"" from some sort of stasis.

Track 2. (Black Summer)  
With Tony exiting stasis, he finds himself already on a journey to somewhere, anywhere really. He's not sure exactly where he's going or where he came from, but at least he has his self-characteristics to go off of.

Tracks 3-8. (Poster Child, Shoot Me a Smile, Aquatic Mouth Dance, The Great Apes, Tippa My Tongue, These are the Ways)  
Tony is just feeling himself right now. He's warming up and hanging with his crew.

Track 9. (Reach Out)  
Tony finds someone who he really cares about.

Tracks 10-16. (Copperbelly, White Braids and Pillow Chair, Here Ever After, It's Only Natural, She's a Lover, Handful, Peace and Love)  
Turns out Tony is really thinking that this person is more than just friends. As he warms up to this idea, he is practically enchanted. The honeymoon phase. Is this real or fantasy? What could go wrong?

Tracks 17-18. (Bella, Fake as Fu@k)  
Turns out this Bella fella ain't all that.

Tracks 19-20. (Nerve Flip, Afterlife)  
Tony returns to his life of degeneracy and adventure to dull any feelings he has from this series of events. He is sure that this will help him move forward.

Tracks 21-26. (Eddie, The Drummer, Bag of Grins, Whatchu Thinkin, The Heavy Wing, Carry Me Home)  
Tony wavers between acceptance and anger, but after an undisclosed amount of time, he realizes that he's just alone. Totally isolated. What he had before may have been too good to be true, but he would do anything to get another chance. After all, ""it's only gold.""

Track 27. (In the Snow)  
Tony's come a long way since he began his oddysey. Somehow he is right back where he began...

Let me know what you think. ü§ò I personally will be using this to listen to songs from this era moving forward. I was fairly neutral on both of these albums before, but I have a newfound appreciation for what soundscapes they created during these sessions."

Loadout Preference? We'd love to hear your feedback!,ForTheKing,1i9770f,2025-01-24 16:58:02,50,0.96,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForTheKing/comments/1i9770f/loadout_preference_wed_love_to_hear_your_feedback/,Brewd_IOG,For The King 2,"Hello folks! Brewd here the Community Manager from IronOak! Outside of my ""chatting to people on the internet role"" I also playtest the game a whole bunch‚Äîwhich is what brings me to your welcoming doors today, Adventurers.

We're working on some Loadout changes for future content updates, with some themed changes, buffs, and balances to the gear you can take along with you in both Overworld and Dark Carnival. But as I dive into my preferences and some of the data we've collected from player habits, I wanted to reach out and chat with folk from the community to learn more about player preference with a more open question, rather than pure data.

* Do you enjoy the Loadout system?
* What do you feel is lacking in the Loadout system?
* We'll likely be adjusting Loadout point values as well, but, for the time being do you feel the Loadout points work well? (Inc. amount for difficulty, total, item price, etc)
* Any other Loadout feedback?

For me, I love running some Gold on my first character to pick up an early Merc, with the odd piece of Candy, Lockpick, a Tinderpouch, and gear, depending on the stage. But I know some players prefer just to grab all candy to sell, all gold, etc.

We want to make those choices a bit more fun, so one prevailing meta doesn't entirely control the Loadout, but also injects some fun flavour tied to updates and feedback, so conversations like this really help!

Want to say as a side note, that not many developers are fortunate enough to have a community willing to provide great feedback in comprehensible and actionable ways, so just want to bring extra attention to how grateful I am for having a space like Reddit, Discord, and social where we can reach out, chat, and have genuine conversations with players, so thanks <3

**Chapter 9: Cavalry:**

A few hours later, Jed reopened the game to find Kosma asleep, curled up in the seat, covered by a deflated inflatable raft she was using as a makeshift blanket. Her ears twitched from time to time and there was a soft rumbling sound coming from her.

¬†

""OH MY GOD, ARE YOU PURRING!?"" said Jed in a very excited tone as Kosma jerked awake, immediately stopping the purring, horror washing over her face as her brain processed what Jed had just said.

¬†

""WHAT!? NO! SHUT UP!"" her eyes darting nervously from side to side as she was caught red-handed.

¬†

""Come on Kosma, it's adorable, I bet you'd love to be petted..."", as Jed said this she shot him a killer look.

¬†

""IT'S NOT CUTE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! STOP MAKING THINGS UP!"" she was so angry, and he loved every second of it, but now that she was awake, they had to continue their journey.

¬†

""Ready to save the guys on the surface? You know, if the fleet is coming to help, wouldn't that mean the game is about to end? It's weird that no villain has shown up or anything,"" Jed said as Kosma lowered the submersible into the water and disconnected it from the crane.

¬†

""I mean, yeah, kind of a weird story, there must be someone behind these robots..."" she tilted her head in curiosity as she flipped through a manual on the basic controls of the sub while the key bindings for it appeared on the in-game interface for Jed.

¬†

""It's like the cutscenes are missing, you know? That robot was clearly after you in particular, hell, there's no music either, which is weird for a game like this, don't you think?"" he wondered what an actual soundtrack for their game would be like. On the other hand, maybe it was better that there was no looping music on every level, it would drive her crazy after a few days.

¬†

""Hmmm yeah, what do you think they look like? Maybe an ancient Onirak general, kept alive by cybernetics, sending his army of machines to take revenge on those who defeated his empire long ago..."", Kosma imagined an angry Onirak cyborg screaming at his underlings when he saw her decapitating his stupid assassin robot.

¬†

""Hmm, maybe it's a different species altogether, who says it's a he? What if it's a she, a super-hot abomination with ridiculously skimpy armor, a pair of robotic limbs sticking out of her back, and glowing red mechanical eyes,"" Jed described his version of their supposed antagonist, Kosma shooting him a strange look.

¬†

""First of all, you're a pervert, and secondly, you wouldn't be saying that if you knew what an Onirak looked like... because damn it, they make even humans look normal,"" Kosma said, remembering pictures from history books of the multi-limbed creatures with wrinkled, leathery bronze skin and deep black eyes adorned with gold-trimmed armor.

¬†

""Ouch... they must be pretty horrible then, I'll be honest, I was imagining a human girl, probably a redhead, you know, to match the color scheme of those robots!"", the more she heard Jed describe this fictional woman, the more she squinted her eyes and the further back her ears went.

¬†

""Are you jealous right now?"", Jed asked in an incredulous yet teasing tone.

¬†

""No... I just want you to shut up until we get to shore... HMPF!"" she huffed as she grabbed the controls of the submarine and began to sail up towards the surface. Soon the darkness began to lift with her ascent, and as a few rays of sunlight became visible, she saw a pod of four glidefish swimming just below the waterline.

¬†

Her intercom came to life again as a very stressed technician spoke;

""KOSMA! HOW LONG TILL YOU GET HERE!? There is a crane on the shore, approach it and it will lift the sub to the landing pad, we left your armor there, HURRY!"" as the Indaran technician spoke, a firefight could be heard in the background.

¬†

Eventually, the clamps of the crane could be seen just below the surface near the shore. Kosma maneuvered the submarine underneath them and felt the cockpit shake as the magnetic clamps grabbed her and began to pull her out of the water.

During the slow ascent, she noticed a large mothership like the one that had attacked Octanor Station looming on the horizon, as dozens of transports emerged from it and flew toward the control center, red bolts of energy coming from all over the island.

Once the submarine was placed on a platform near the landing pad, Kosma ran quickly to her ship, hastily changing into her old armor as Jed minimized the window to give her privacy.

¬†

""It's good to wear something decent again,"" she said as she put on the final pieces of the suit.

¬†

""Are you still mad?"" asked Jed with a hint of concern in his voice.

¬†

""Just a little, help me smash that stupid redhead's toys and we will be even!"", Kosma replied with a smile as she tried to turn her beam pistol once more. She forgot to put the safety on and accidentally pulled the trigger, causing the beam to deflect off the wall of the ship and hit her shoulder, with the armor absorbing most of the damage. Ignoring the pain, she walked out of the ship as if nothing had happened.

¬†

""You... really should stop doing that..."", Jed said, laughing audibly.

¬†

""Come on, I almost got it right this time,"" Kosma was just thankful that the beam didn't deflect directly into her face.

¬†

The Indaran technician was waiting for her at the roof entrance of the building with two Narokan security guards holding U.F.R. weapons next to him.

¬†

""KOSMA! OVER HERE!"" he waved enthusiastically, glancing over his shoulder from time to time, as the moment Kosma approached, a transport ship opened large doors on its sides, revealing racks full of spider-bots that quickly deployed on the roof as it used its turret to cover the dismounting troops before flying away.

¬†

""I'll leave the shooting to you, leave the melee to me,"" Kosma said as she trained her weapon on one of the enemies, Jed quickly dispatched several of the spiders with the beam pistol, then switched to the U.F.R weapon and fired it at a spider-bot on the other side of the rooftop. The bullets that didn't completely miss did very little damage, and it took more than half the magazine to put one of them down.

¬†

""THIS GUN SUCKS! No wonder security is struggling..."" Jed complained as he made Kosma switch back to the ray pistol.

¬†

""Hey! Against those crabs it was incredible, I didn't let you control me because it was too much fun..."", Kosma replied as she dodged an incoming volley of red bolts, being able to use her suit's thrusters again made dodging so much easier.

¬†

""Let me guess... you want me to leave a few alive so you can use your new sword on them?"" he teased as Kosma watched the guards struggle to take down a single bot in the time she was able to dispatch over eight of them, the U.F.R. really were not the right weapons for the job.

¬†

""Whoa! How did you know?"" said Kosma with a grin as Jed took down a few more of the enemies, leaving only three of them standing.

¬†

""Oh, I know what the ladies like,"" Jed replied in a smug tone as he watched Kosma equip the blade. It was so large that she had to hold it with both arms at an odd angle to keep her balance as she attacked the remaining trio of enemies.

Kosma let out a mighty battle cry as she swung the blade in a wide arc, striking all three enemies and cutting through them like butter. However, the blade was very heavy and had a lot of momentum behind it as she spun out of control and fell face first into the ground, the blade sending one of the guards flying and impaling him on the wall.

¬†

""Jed... not a word..."" Kosma said as she got back up, then she noticed where the blade had landed.

¬†

""I'd be very freaked out right now if I didn't know better... I thought you said NPCS were unkillable?"" asked Kosma nonchalantly, pulling the sword out of the corpse.

¬†

""Probably only the plot-relevant ones, like the technician, damn, that was cold,"" Jed said, watching her calm demeanor.

Kosma just shrugged before replying, ""Like I said, if I had done that to a sentient being, I would never sleep again.

The group made their way through the control center, finding small groups of guards engaging the robotic menace as she helped turn the tide of each battle. Though her new sword was extremely awkward to use and she didn't really know what she was doing with it, she felt incredibly badass slicing through enemies with it, even if she got hit a few times for insisting on using it.

¬†

""We just need to get through this door to the security office and we can turn on the defense system!"" The technician said as he pressed his face to the retinal scan of a door. It opened to a huge courtyard decorated with strange purple plants and a pair of wooden bridges crossing an artificial river below and statues lining the sides.

¬†

Kosma froze when she saw what awaited her in that courtyard, she froze in fear. Four vanguard eliminator units with two heavy walkers behind them and several smaller spider-bots.

The heavy walkers immediately trained their weapons on Kosma, while the smaller bots prepared to rush her. Then one of the vanguard Eliminators, adorned with a larger shoulder pad with white stripes, raised its left hand with an open palm and closed its fist in the air before speaking,

""Hold your fire, she is ours,"" it said in a voice identical to the machine it had fought at the facility. The four robots grabbed their blades as they approached Kosma.

¬†

""No... no no no no no no!"", Kosma fell to her knees as tears streamed down her face and just stared at the four robots making their way towards her.

¬†

""Kosma get up, it will take a few tries but we can do it!"" said Jed with little confidence in his own words, they barely managed to defeat a single Vanguard Eliminator and now the game was treating her like a normal enemy.

Kosma was also barely responding to the inputs, her shaky legs carrying her awkwardly forward and her weak arms struggling not to drop her weapon.

¬†

""Jed, before I lose my mind forever, it has been an honor to know you..."", Kosma said, turning to the camera and smiling one last time before facing her opponents. She braced herself for pain as her ears picked up something that had been conspicuously absent throughout the adventure, music.

¬†

""C... can you hear that too?"", the sound of music and the roar of engines, quickly getting louder, but only coming from one side of the screen.

¬†

""Yes... why now?... KOSMA LOOK!"" Jed shouted as the heavy walkers aimed their weapons at the air and began firing, a volley of missiles quickly dispatching them as the music grew louder. A torrent of blue energy bolts rained down on the other machines, obliterating the smaller spider bots as the mechanical swordsmen blocked the fire with the energy fields of their blades.

¬†

The fire came from a group of four white and orange transport gunships, their wings painted with the flag of the Sadurian Stellar Union and an Indaran skull logo.

¬†

""This is the 118th Battalion of the Sadurian Defense Force, we are here to protect you!"" a voice boomed over the loudspeakers of one of the ships as they passed directly over Kosma, still laying suppressive fire on the vanguard eliminators.

¬†

Ropes came down from the ships as a number of robotic soldiers rappelled into the courtyard and took up firing positions.

The Sadurian robot soldiers were similar in proportion to Kosma, only slightly taller. Their heads were smooth cylinders with antennas on the sides and a single large, glowing orange eye that could compress itself and change shape slightly, giving the troopers a surprising amount of expression. They had the skull logo of the 118th Regiment on their left shoulder and the flag of the Sadurian Union on the other, their serial number printed on the front and back of their torso. They had beige plating covering their gray inner frames, with bright orange markings.

¬†

""Protect the Fuzzies!"" one of them shouted in a stereotypical robotic voice,

¬†

""Let them have it!"" shouted another of the troopers as they began unloading their weapons on the vanguard eliminators, which blocked almost every projectile that came their way.

¬†

""CONCENTRATE FIRE ON THEIR LEADER, YOU MORONS!"" shouted a stern voice, still robotic but much more expressive than the others, coming from a taller robot wearing a white captain's hat attached to its head with elastic bands. It looked much closer to a robotic version of an Indaran than the others, except for the conspicuous absence of a tail, and the ears were replaced by flat antennas pointing upwards, its head was shaped like a simplified skull, missing the lower jaw, with a pair of round glowing white eye sockets. He was covered in a dark gray and faded blue paint scheme, a similar shade to Indaran's fur with orange accents, but covering a larger area than his troopers, as well as some hand-painted markings on his shoulders and forearms.

Kosma watched in disbelief as they took down one of the vanguard Eliminators in seconds, overwhelming its defenses as the other three began to rush their position.

¬†

""DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING? The idiots with the heavy weapons are doing your job!"" the leader slapped a trooper with a rocket launcher on his back as he hastily mounted the heavy weapon. Another rocket trooper followed suit, firing a pair of rockets at the oncoming enemies, instantly obliterating their upper torsos, leaving only their legs, which took a few steps forward before collapsing.

¬†

The last vanguard eliminator was brought down by the combined fire of the troopers as the leader turned to Kosma,

""Captain Kalax at your service, Trailblazer, we were told you needed help turning on the defense system,"" it said, making an exaggerated salute as Kosma just began to hug Kalax, even wrapping her tail around him.

¬†

""JED! I WANT TO MARRY THIS ROBOT!"", Kosma exclaimed as the captain showed no reaction to her sudden affection.

¬†

""I don't blame you... I'd do the same... talk about a deus ex machina... literally,"" Jed said, relief washing over him.

¬†

""Deu what?"" said a confused Kosma, still clinging to the robot.

¬†

""Never mind... just a human expression,"" Jed replied as he watched the Captain bark orders at his troopers and walk around with Kosma clinging to Kalax's chest like a koala.

¬†

The Captain replied to something Kosma must have been scripted to say, ""Kosma, I'll lead the way, don't worry, we'll save some toasters for you,"" Kalax raised his weapon and racked the bolt, causing Kosma to fall off him as Jed wondered why an energy weapon would need a bolt at all.

¬†

""Captain, that is a very offensive term to refer to robotic life forms..."" one of the troopers said, raising his finger as Kalax gave him the angriest look the limited expression of his mechanical eyes would allow.

¬†

""Trooper, would you like to spearhead the breach or would you like me to stop insulting robots?"" replied Kalax as they took up positions near the door.

¬†

""Lead the way, sir..."" the trooper said in a cowardly tone as he moved to the back of the formation.

¬†

""Thought so..."" said Kalax, as if interactions like this were a regular occurrence.

¬†

""...Uh, isn't that guy a robot too?"", Jed asked slightly confused and amused, ""Like, wouldn't robots be okay with insulting enemy robots?""

¬†

Kosma was about to reply when Kalax interrupted, ""Ma'am, I may be a toaster now, but it wasn't always like that, you can thank the Transcendence Program for that.""

¬†

She blinked in surprise as the Captain seemed to have spoken directly to her, even if it was pre-scripted dialog, it was meant to be about interactions with her, if Jed hadn't brought it up, she probably would have asked the exact same question.

As Kalax placed an explosive charge on the door, he warned the group, ""Charge is armed, stay clear,"" a small holographic projector showed a 10-second countdown. Then the Indaran technician, who had been hiding behind one of the statues since they had entered the courtyard, came running out, flailing his arms when he saw what the soldiers were about to do.

¬†

¬†""WAIT! I have the pass to unlock this door, there is no need to use explosives!"" the technician shouted as the captain stepped away from the door and stared at the technician with an incredulous look.

¬†

""Sir, with all due respect, that would have been great information to have before arming the..."", before Kalax could finish his explanation, the charge completed its countdown.¬† The door was blown off its hinges as the captain and his troopers rushed into the room, while the technician was knocked off his feet by the shockwave.

A trooper came to help him to his feet, making sure the Indaran was not seriously injured.

""Don't worry, sir, the Saurian government will pay for everything we are likely to destroy,"" the robot said before rushing into the building with the others.

¬†

Kosma walked awkwardly past the shocked technician as he ran for cover into the building they had come from.

Despite the chaos around her, Kosma couldn't help but feel a strange sense of comfort. At least the Trooper NPCs were quite competent in combat and she didn't have to do much more than dodge the occasional energy bolt.

There was very little enemy resistance, in fact the Troopers outnumbered the Spiderbots considerably when they stormed the building, which made Kosma worry about what was to come. A few gunfights later, they made their way into a very large, mostly empty room, with a heavy-duty door at the far end leading to the security terminal,

¬†

The room had some conveniently placed solid concrete benches and pillars right in front of the door and was flanked by massive windows that gave Kosma a view of the ensuing battle, more Sadurian dropships were deploying more troopers all over the facility, but it was obvious that the enemy was vastly outnumbered.

""Explosives won't work, E-13, E-19, cut through that door! Everyone else, defensive positions,"" Kalax ordered, as Kosma watched two troopers with yellow paint and slightly bulkier frames take blowtorches to the armored door.

¬†

Seconds later, dozens of spider-bots began to swarm the room, the troopers opening fire as their eyes took on worried expressions,

""Sir! You didn't tell us this was going to be an even fight!"" a trooper shouted in a panicked voice as he ducked behind cover, narrowly avoiding a volley of enemy fire.

¬†

""Don't worry, trooper, the enemy is only outnumbering us 10 to 1!"" the captain said in a nonchalant voice as he killed a few spiders before ducking into cover to reload. Meanwhile, Kosma was hiding behind a piece of cover so small she had to bend her ears to the side so they wouldn't be exposed when Jed said,

¬†

""Hey, I don't think they're going to be able to take them all, are you ready?"", Kosma looked back at him before speaking,

¬†

""Whaaat? Nah, they can do it, they are made for it!"", as if on cue, right after she said that one of the troopers was shot to pieces, erupting in a fiery explosion as his head fell at Kosma's feet.

¬†

""Robot heaven... I see it!"" the disembodied head said before the glow in its eye slowly faded and Kosma simply shoved it aside,

¬†

""Seriously?"", Jed said somewhat incredulously as two more troopers were taken down by enemy fire. Finally, she took a deep breath and prepared herself.

¬†

""FINE! I'LL DO IT!"", Kosma shouted in a frustrated tone as she jumped out of cover, the spider-bots almost on top of her. She ran towards the enemy horde, baton in hand, as much as she liked her new sword, her trusty kinetic baton was far more reliable and she actually knew how to fight with it.

Blue and red bolts whizzed around her as Shy used her rocket boots to leap into the air, landing on a spider-bot and slamming her staff into it, sending sparks and shards of metal flying everywhere. With little input from Jed, she deftly dodged the melee attacks of nearby enemies. She had gotten used to fighting this type of enemy and knew all their moves.

She would counterattack after each enemy strike, quickly thinning their ranks. When it came to ranged combat, she would let Jed take control as he quickly sniped at their weak spots with the beam pistol, switching to the submachine gun to empty the entire magazine into another enemy, completely obliterating them before switching back to the pistol.

¬†

""Trailblazer, that was excellent shooting! You will make the troopers feel insecure!"" shouted Kalax from the defensive position as a trooper interjected,

¬†

""Sir, she took down more than you did!""

¬†

""SHUT YOUR SPEAKER IF YOU DON'T WANT A FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT S-15!"" the captain shouted. This made Kosma feel incredibly empowered, she had probably taken down over half of the enemies alone.

As she took down the last remaining targets with her shotgun, the adrenaline rush helping her to ignore the pain in her shoulder, the robots began to cheer her and raise their weapons in the air.

¬†

""Do you think she is single?"" exclaimed one of the robots, causing Kosma to stare at them with a blank expression,

¬†

""S-12, you are not programmed to feel love..."" another robot replied matter-of-factly as S-12 shrugged his shoulders,

¬†

""Right, I forgot my programming,"" Kosma chuckled as she looked back at the camera,

¬†

""Well Jed, if you don't want to date me, I think there are other people who are interested..."" she said in a playfully teasing tone,

¬†

""And how would you date a robot anyway? They don't even have a face or anything,"" Jed replied.

¬†

""We could... umm, cuddle! While he talks to me about combat protocols and..."", Kosma ran out of things to list as she stared back at S-12, imagining what a dinner date with a Sadurian Defense Force soldier would look like, wondering if he would just rub food on his featureless face while pretending to eat.

¬†

""Besides, didn't you want to marry the captain? And I had feelings for that shotgun, then again, I saw you making bedroom eyes at that new blade of yours... you need to calm down,"" Jed replied, teasing her back as an enemy transport hovered on the other side of the windows and opened fire on Kosma and the troopers.

¬†

""The Captain was... a spur of the moment thing!"" exclaimed Kosma as she dashed behind a pillar using the thrusters on the back of her suit, ""And fine, I have a love triangle with my shotgun and my blade... you wouldn't understand!"" she said in an overly dramatic voice as the transport opened its bay doors to reveal three vanguard eliminator units who immediately rushed at the troopers, deflecting their shots.

¬†

""Great..."" Jed said as Kosma poked her head out of cover to see what was happening.

¬†

""NOT THOSE THINGS AGAIN..."" said Kosma, her ears and tail dropping quickly in fear.

¬†

""WE ARE OUT OF ROCKETS, SIR!"" shouted one of the troopers holding an empty rocket launcher before one of the vanguards plunged his sword through his chest.

¬†

""WHY WOULD THEY PROGRAM US TO FEEL TERROR!?"" shouted another as he began to run away from the vanguards as Kalax grabbed his arm.

¬†

""TROOPERS, DO YOUR GODDAMN JOBS! DISTRACT THE ENEMY AND THE TRAILBLAZER WILL FLANK THEM!"" bellowed Kalax's stern voice with a hint of fear in it as his troops engaged the vanguard eliminators.

The Sadurian Defense Force troops were no match for the Eliminator units in hand-to-hand combat, barely managing to hit them with the butt of their weapons a few times before being quickly cut to pieces.

As one of the vanguard Eliminators vertically sliced a trooper who tried to parry the sword strike with his weapon, Kalax approached the robot with a large combat knife, managing to parry his enemy's blows and somehow keep up.

¬†

""You heard the man, Kosma, this is our chance!"" said Jed, trying to encourage her, as Kosma hyperventilated before psyching herself up to attack them.

¬†

""Let's do it!"" shouted Kosma, shotgun in hand, as she fired at one of the vanguards in the back of the head, completely disintegrating it as the headless body fell to its knees, dropping the blade before falling to the side. The terrified trooper who would have been her next target gave Kosma a quick thumbs up before continuing to fire at another enemy.

¬†

As she approached the next vanguard unit, overwhelmed by the combined fire of the remaining troopers, it locked eyes with her before leaping into the air at Kosma. She was paralyzed, but Jed reacted quickly, making her dodge out of the way and pulling out her baton. Sweating bullets, he worked with Kosma to parry the onslaught of attacks from the machine as the troopers fired at it.

¬†

""We are supposed to protect the fur-ball, but the fur-ball is protecting us!? DOES NOT COMPUTE!"" one of the troopers shouted, causing Kosma to lose her concentration for a moment.

The vanguard hit her stomach with a horizontal slash, it would have cut her in half if she hadn't dodged at the last second, but it still managed to inflict a large wound on her belly. Kosma was glad she wasn't still wearing the diving suit as her armor covered the wound with foam to stop the bleeding, the hit had taken over a quarter of her health bar, but she could still fight.

""STUPID TROOPERS! No wonder the captain..."" she jumped back to avoid an attack that would have decapitated her, ""...no wonder he is so rude to them..."" Kosma said in an annoyed tone.

¬†

She managed to hit the machine a few times as it began to emit smoke and sparks as its once swift movements became jerky and clumsy. Thanks to the Troopers' chip damage, the battle had been considerably shorter, and it also helped that she had her suit's thrusters for extra mobility.

As soon as Kosma saw an opening, she switched to her blade and sliced diagonally through the robot's chest, watching it fall to the ground as it burst into flames.

As she turned to fight the last Vanguard Eliminator, Kalax kicked it in the chest, knocking the robot onto its back. The Captain stepped on the blade to prevent the robot from lifting it and grabbed his sidearm, a beam pistol not unlike Kosma's, and fired into the Eliminator's chest until the weapon overheated long after it had stopped moving.

¬†

The engineers conveniently finished cutting through the door only seconds after the fight ended. Kosma was stretching her right arm and rubbing her shoulder when Kalax turned to speak with her.

¬†

""That was some impressive shooting, Trailblazer, may I ask your name?"" the captain said as his mechanical eyes locked with Kosma, who thought for a second before smiling.

""I am Adelaine the Third, Queen of the Trinary Suns,"" Kosma replied in a deadpan tone as she heard Jed utter an audible ""What?"".

¬†

""Well, Kosma, you made my troopers look bad, now let's get that defense system online!"" the captain continued with his scripted lines to her mild amusement.

Kosma sighed as she followed the troopers through the door, ""Man, it's finally over, that guy feels like an interesting person to meet, I wonder what happened to turn him into a robot..."" she pondered as she watched Kalax and his soldiers standing around the security terminal, clearly waiting for her to interact with it.

¬†

""Is the Transcendence program some kind of digital brain scan?"" asked Jed with genuine curiosity,

¬†

""Wait, you can wrap your mind around that? Color me surprised!"" she raised an ear and an eyebrow curiously as she used a vial of regen-gel to heal the wound on her stomach.

¬†

""I mean, we may be primitive, but there is a thing called science fiction, you know?"", Kosma watched her wound and the gap in her armor close before her eyes, but the term ""science fiction"" made her shoot a strange look at Jed.

¬†

""As in... fake science? How does that even work?"" as she asked him, Kosma realized something she had not noticed before. Despite the huge gap in technological advancement between them, Jed didn't act shocked or surprised by robots or faster-than-light travel...

¬†

""Well... technically yes, it is made up, but how, for entertainment, we write stories of what the future might look like, we are very far from copying our minds into robots. Hell, it's considered impressive when we make a robot that can climb stairs without falling over..."" Jed explained, surprised by Kosma's look of utter curiosity and confusion.

¬†

""I mean, my people also write fantastic stories, but usually it's either a made-up world or the idealized past... finally something that doesn't make you humans have nightmares!"", as Kosma made it clear that her kind had no concept of science fiction, Jed was already making a huge list of media to show her, wondering how she would react.

¬†

""Kosma, I will bombard you with recommendations when we get back to the ship. Now, about Kalax, is he like a copy of a dead man's mind transferred into a robot body?"" before Kosma could answer Jed's question, one of the troopers waved his hand and yelled;

¬†

""TERMINAL IS RIGHT HERE!"" and then pointed to the defense system with both hands in a cartoonishly exaggerated motion.

¬†

""They're kind of cute, but damn, they're starting to get annoying,"" Kosma said, squinting at the trooper before shaking her head and looking back at Jed,

""Wait, a dead man? No! That sounds very messed up. The transcendence program just puts your mind into a robot body...um, how do I explain this...before regen-gel was a thing, if someone was critically injured or afflicted with something incurable, they would do this to them...it's still done when someone suffers from certain diseases or gets wounded so badly that not even regen-gel or medical bays can cure it.... But yeah, it's still pretty messed up,"" this explanation surprised Jed quite a bit, as from what he saw, regen-gel seemed like a magical cure-all.

¬†

""So, no coin toss? No loss of continuity? Sounds like a lot to me,"" Jed said, wondering what it would feel like to inhabit a military-grade mechanical body, it would certainly be better than the slowly decaying flesh vessel he was confined to.

¬†

""WHAT!? NO! That's a fate worse than death! Look at him, it would take a very strong or very crazy person to go through with this... I would go crazy if I woke up as a robot after my next death... no skin, no fur, no mouth... in a way, yes, transferred humans are dead men walking. Besides... coin toss?"", she sounded as if the whole idea upset her deeply, but Jed was still struggling to see the disadvantages of it.

¬†

""KOSMA! GET YOUR FURRY ASS OVER HEARTS AND ACTIVATE THE DEFENSE SYSTEM!"", Kalax shouted in the stern voice he had so far only used on his troops, causing Kosma's ears to perk up before he turned back to Jed.

¬†

""Eh, you don't want to know what the coin toss is, trust me... I think we should get going,"" Jed said as Kosma started to walk to the terminal.

¬†

""Seriously? Jed... I had my skull crushed by a murderous robot and saw what my intestines look like today, I doubt some made-up human science is going to make my mental state any worse than it already is..."", Kosma replied with a serious tone, feeling as if Jed was being condescending.

¬†

""I mean, considering you've been traumatized by furry artwork... look, it's just that you seem to be at your limit, I wouldn't want to cause unnecessary stress,"" after finishing his sentence, Jed quickly pressed the interact button on the terminal when Kosma felt her hands move towards it.

¬†

""HEY! Sheesh point taken... AND THAT WASN'T JUST ARTWORK, IT WAS THE MOST BIZARRE AND UNSETTLING STUFF I HAVE EVER SEEN!"" Kosma fumed as Jed had reawakened her memories, once again unable to suppress his laughter.

¬†

The terminal's interface displayed options for deploying automated defense turrets and fighter drones. However, the large anti-orbital pulse cannon displayed an error message: ""Requires on-site activation"".

¬†

""Seriously? I guess it's up to me to activate it... and it's over 8200 meters away, great..."" her ears dropped as she clenched her fists in frustration, wishing this level would end already.

Do faction benefits appply to others in the warband or only to the specific character?

I'm mostly wondering in that I'm leveling an alt and I don't normally get the table rewards from draenor/shadowlands that reward gear because it's vendor trash for my main and not worth the gold it takes to sell.  But I was thinking since I have a couple alts I'm working on maybe they might make use of the gear drops from the adventure tables?

It's bind on pick up, but if my warband characters can pick up the adventure clearning then that would very much give them the gear rather than my main and free purple gear is free purple gear while leveling.

Any thoughts appreciated :)

I know their's heirlooms but that's a whole system I've invested nothing into and I'm not sure it's worth grinding that out since it doesn't offer bonus XP anymore.  Without the bonus xp it wouldn't save much time if I have to go get another currency to farm gear for a character that will be max level in a couple days anyway."

# About the adventure

Hi! **Wrath of the Kaiju** is an exciting series of Kaiju hunts taking place in the Yokai Realms, an eastern-asia-inspired setting from the amazing folks at Loot Tavern, described in the **Ryoko's Guide to the Yokai Realms**, one of the most successful TTRPG Kickstarter projects of all time. Five factions are active in the Yokai Realms, and all of them are looking for the help of brave or otherwise trouble-looking adventurers to deal with the most troublesome form of Yokai there is: Kaiju. Each faction has their own goals, and would like for these quite literally colossal problems to be dealt with in different ways, each offering their own reward. Which of these will appeal more to you? And what might these factions be scheming behind the curtains?

The campaign is designed with a dynamic level tier, so the Player Characters should start as a group of either 5th, 11th or 16th level characters! A nice chance to jumpstart the initial grind, with the certainty that the dangers that lie ahead will pose an adequate and exciting challenge.

So... Do you feel ready? Then sharpen your dice, and let's hunt some kaiju!

Even if it means teaming up with a young lich who dreams of conquering the world, a thief seeking to steal from a death god and a paladin too holy for her own good. As they dive into the largest dungeon in the world, eyes are on them.""

""Another undead army has risen from the Paris catacombs. King Le'quein has ordered a full evacuation of the eastern district as a result-"" The TV droned on as Zaire stretched his aching legs against the kitchen table. A new monster wave in Europe meant extra work for him. As his grandfather's only employee, it was on him to assemble the teleportation apparatus. He sighed. What can a guy do to get a break around here?

There were times Granddad forgot he was one person. His muscles were still sore from the two hours of crawling through the station's air ducts for a dead pixie. The smell had yet to clear from his memory. Just as he thought of calling for the old man, the kitchen door opened. The stout mage wore his trademark two-sizes-too-small military jacket over a gaudy ensemble of home-stitched clothes, a smile on his wrinkled face. A smile that dropped when he saw Zaire.

""Boy, get your sweaty body off my table,"" The old man said, the sequins of his pants gleaming from black to gold as he shifted into a military stance.

""Why it's not like we eat here,"" Zaire replied.

Grandfather was what adventurers called a mana whale‚Äî a mage who fully devoted themselves to growing their mana pool with little consideration of other traits. Instead of spell flinging, they would pump high amounts of mana into prebuilt runes, apparatuses, and foundations. In his grandfather's case, the term whale was more than fitting."

[SOTC] Watch Collection at 19,Watches,1i95exv,2025-01-24 15:40:48,7,0.68,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i95exv,Reeves_Wilmoth,I took a picture,"I've been collecting since I was 16. I think I am done for now and won't be saving up for another watch for a at least 5 years or more. Each watch in the box has a cool story behind it, so I'll cover them real quickly.

Omega Speedmaster 3861 Sapphire:
This js my dream watch, I got her for $3k under retail vrand new box and stickers and warrenty through an online watch dealer who worked with a boutique. I love this thing and it is my daily driver of a watch.

Tissot Seastar:
My uncle gave me this watch a couple months ago. He wore it from the 70s to the 2000s. He got it as a gift from an offical at Tissot after installing a new kitchen into his house in the 70s.

Seiko 6139-7060:
I saved this watch from a crackhouse in September after seeing a listing for watches on Facebook marketplace. The person had 2 Walmart bags of crap watches and this was in there with it. When I showed up to his house to look at his watches by myself (dumb idea) it was a run doen trailer with random people just tweaking out inside. He had the watch apart and tried ""fixxing"" it himself. It cost me $7 for the watch and I got it completely refinished and fixxed for $360. I got a Porche Martini Racing strap to wear it on and it looks great. I just got it back from service today.

KM Siegerin Kriegsmarine WW2 watch:
I bought this watch from a military surplus store off of Gold Beach at Normandy on a school trip to France. It is all orignal parts and band and was never refinished. I never wear this watch as there is no way to take the band off without damaging it, it's more of a memory / historical peice for me. It was most likely worn by a German naval officer in WWII and was most likely produced from 1937 - 1939

Hamilton Khaki King Automatic (ETA Movment)
This was the first watch I bought for myself. I got it from ebay when I was 16. I wore it every day for 4 months straight until I got my second watch. I still wear it occasionally now, but it lives mostly in the box. 

Sekio Alpinist Sarb017:
My pride and joy, this is my favorite watch. I wore this 24/7 (except showers) every day from November 2022 to October 2024. It was my everything watch. I have worn this watch through thick and thin and it has never failed me. The 200m water resistance and the Sapphire glass really makes this thing a dressy beast. I wear it regularly alongside my Speedy.


Rest of watches: the majority all have their own little stories, but aren't nearly as interesting. The G Shock and Garmin are going to be my millitary watches as I ship to Army Basic this Monday. I hope you all enjoyed reading about my watch collecting adventures. 


TLDR; I got a lot of cool watches."
Time Gate Thread,idlechampions,1i94gk7,2025-01-24 15:00:10,9,1.0,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/idlechampions/comments/1i94gk7/time_gate_thread/,AutoModerator,Time Gate Thread,"# It's Time For Time Gates!

As you enter the Tower of Mystra to seek advice from Kaylaar Allun, a tiny, magical, one-eyed construct whirs to life and calls for attention, speaking with a familiar voice...

**<*****Mip-Mop*****>** Greetings, champions! This is an automatically generated scheduled post for the open discussion of Time Gates. Please use this thread to ask questions and seek advice concerning Time Gates. Don't know what Time Gates are? Not sure which champion to choose for your Time Gate? This thread is for you!

* Time Gates allow players to unlock and gear up previously released event champions! 
* A natural Time Gate opens every three weeks, on weekends in between normal events. 
* Time Gates can also be opened manually by using six Time Gate pieces, which have a chance to drop from defeated bosses in any adventure every five to six days. 
* Natural Time Gates offer a random selection of event champions. Manual Time Gates allow you to choose any event champion from the full list. 
* Once you choose a champion, you can play their event adventures. Complete up to two normal adventures and one adventure variant for that champion to receive one gold chest for that champion for each completed task. You can also do free plays of the event adventure. 
* Each time you defeat a boss on unique stage increments of 100 during that Time Gate, you will earn one silver chest for that champion. 
* From the moment a Time Gate opens, you have exactly three days to earn its rewards before it is closed. 
* When the Time Gate closes, you will be forced to convert your Mystra's Favor to a permanent campaign favor of your choice, however the conversion rate will be 25% that of normal event favor conversion rate. For example, 1.00e10 Mystra's Favor will grant a 25% increase to a permanent campaign of your choice, whereas this same favor amount during an event would grant a 100% increase. 
* You will be given two Time Gate Pieces when the Time Gate is closed (minus one for each claimed gold chest reward).

Good luck with your Time Gates, champions! **<*****Mip-Mop*****>**"

Here's a detailed journey through what to expect and how to make the most of your time.

**Day 1: Marrakech to Dades Valley ‚Äì The Journey Begins**

# Morning Departure and High Atlas Mountains

The adventure kicks off early in the morning, with a departure from Marrakech just as the city begins to stir. The journey takes you southeast, ascending into the breathtaking High Atlas Mountains. The scenic drive through the Tizi n'Tichka Pass (the highest in Morocco) offers panoramic views of rugged peaks and lush valleys. The winding roads might test your nerves, but the vistas are worth every twist and turn.

Small Berber villages dot the landscape, their clay-built homes blending seamlessly with the surroundings. Your guide might stop at a local cooperative where women produce argan oil. It‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to learn about traditional methods and pick up a bottle of the liquid gold.

# Ait Benhaddou: A Glimpse of History

By midday, you‚Äôll arrive at Ait Benhaddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This ancient ksar (fortified village) has served as a backdrop for countless films, including *Gladiator* and *Game of Thrones*. Its earthen walls and maze-like alleys feel like stepping back in time. Take a guided tour to uncover its history and marvel at the panoramic view from the top.

# Dades Valley: The Road of a Thousand Kasbahs

As the day progresses, the journey continues to Dades Valley via Ouarzazate, often called the ""Hollywood of Africa."" The landscapes transform, and you'll soon find yourself surrounded by dramatic rock formations and the iconic ""Monkey Fingers"" hills. The valley is lined with traditional kasbahs and lush oases, creating a contrast that‚Äôs nothing short of mesmerizing.

Spend the night in a charming riad or guesthouse, where you‚Äôll savor a home-cooked Moroccan meal. The warm hospitality of the locals will make you feel like family.

# Day 2: Dades Valley to Merzouga ‚Äì Into the Desert

# Todra Gorge: Nature's Grandeur

After a hearty breakfast, your journey leads to Todra Gorge, a canyon with towering cliffs that reach up to 400 meters. The gorge is a popular spot for rock climbers and photographers, but even casual travelers will be awestruck by its scale and beauty. A short walk through the gorge allows you to soak in the atmosphere and perhaps interact with local shepherds herding their goats.

# The Road to Merzouga

As you head toward Merzouga, the gateway to the Sahara, the scenery shifts to barren plains and occasional clusters of palm trees. The sense of anticipation builds as you catch your first glimpse of the golden dunes of Erg Chebbi.

# Camel Trek and Desert Camp

Arriving in Merzouga, you‚Äôll trade your vehicle for a camel‚Äîa truly iconic desert experience. As your camel caravan makes its way through the dunes at sunset, the surreal beauty of the Sahara will leave you speechless. The shifting colors of the sand, the play of light, and the vast silence create a moment of pure magic.

Your destination is a traditional Berber desert camp nestled amidst the dunes. Here, you‚Äôll be welcomed with mint tea and a warm smile. After dinner, gather around the campfire for Berber music and storytelling under a sky brimming with stars. The lack of light pollution makes the Milky Way appear impossibly vivid, a sight that will stay with you forever.

# Day 3: Merzouga to Marrakech ‚Äì The Return

# Sunrise Over the Dunes

Rise early to witness the sunrise, a moment that feels almost sacred. Watching the first rays of light illuminate the dunes is an experience that words can barely capture.

After breakfast, it‚Äôs time to bid farewell to the desert. The camel ride back to Merzouga offers one last chance to savor the tranquility of the Sahara.

# A Scenic Drive Back

The return journey retraces part of the route but still offers plenty to see. Stop for a leisurely lunch in Ouarzazate or another scenic spot along the way. By the time you arrive back in Marrakech, the city's vibrant energy will feel like a sharp contrast to the peaceful solitude of the desert.

# Practical Tips for Your Trip

* **Pack Smart:** The desert gets chilly at night, even in summer. Bring layers, comfortable shoes, sunscreen, and a hat.
* **Stay Hydrated:** The dry climate can be deceiving. Always keep a bottle of water handy.
* **Respect Local Customs:** Morocco is a predominantly Muslim country. Dress modestly and be mindful of cultural norms, especially in rural areas.
* **Bring Cash:** Small villages and desert camps may not accept credit cards, so carry enough cash for tips and souvenirs.

# Why This Trip Is Unmissable

This 3-day journey offers more than just stunning landscapes. It‚Äôs a chance to connect with Morocco's diverse culture, from the Berber communities of the mountains to the nomads of the Sahara. You‚Äôll leave with a deeper appreciation of this enchanting country and memories that will last a lifetime.

Whether you're traveling solo, with friends, or as a family, a Sahara Desert trip from Marrakech is an adventure that should be on every traveler‚Äôs bucket list. The stories you'll gather, the photos you‚Äôll take, and the moments of quiet reflection amid the dunes will make it a highlight of your Moroccan adventure."
"I dreamed about an anime, and now I'm trying to make something out of it",writers,1i93xrw,2025-01-24 14:37:29,0,0.3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1i93xrw/i_dreamed_about_an_anime_and_now_im_trying_to/,Mountain_Ice_6433,Sharing,"I had a dream. I will write it out, but I forgot some parts of it so I'll replace them with something that makes sense. I'll also add a LOT of new stuff, because obviously the dream by itself isn't really making sense. I envision this as a serious anime, with maybe some comedic moments.

Chapter 1: Beginning  
It starts with a guy of around 22 years old, looks bad and unattractive, unshaved beard, tired eyes, messy hair, very old clothes that don't fit. He is sitting in his dark room, with completely closed blinds. The room is messy, with a lot of trash scattered across it. The bed is in a corner, placed weirdly, right in front of the window.  
We can see the boring life he has, of eating, sleeping, and sitting in front of a very old computer.  
He is on the Internet, searching for something. The browser prompt is, ""How do I find a job"". He reads something, sighs, reads, reads and reads.

The guy stands up, and stretches. He thinks to himself,  
""My parents can't keep giving me money. I should be responsible for my life, I'm not a kid anymore."".  
""But... why can't I just stay like this? I have my parents, right? So I'm good!"".  
...  
""No... they won't be there forever, and they're old. I'm the one that was supposed to be helping them."".  
The guy opens his window and blinds, and looks out of it, with some determination in his eyes.

The guy is walking around outside. He sees a group of three people, a woman and a man in their 40s, and a very young and innocent looking girl with a kind of bob haircut, looking around the age of 18. The adults seem to be the girl's parents. They all very look wealthy. They are walking, and they're about to cross a road.  
The girl notices the guy, and his poor state. She stops on the crosswalk, at the left side of the lane (closer to the guy's side), and looks curiously at him passing by the crosswalk. During the whole time, the guy thinks to himself,  
""Even if I do find a job, the only thing I have is to wait until the end of my days. What's the point if I can end it now?"".  
The girl's parents are distracted by some important conversation. But then, suddenly, the guy hears a car moving rapidly towards the crosswalk. That's when he realized, the car is about to hit the girl. At this moment, time seemed to freeze, and the guy starts thinking to himself,  
""Now... now is my chance to be useful, at least once in my life."".  
The guy reacts, tries to get to the girl before the car does, and tries to protect the girl behind his back. When the car is about to hit them, he closes his eyes.

""... Am I alive?"".

The guy opens his eyes, and sees a car right in front of him. The guy feels a huge relief. After looking around, he sees the parents running to their daughter. The driver walks out of the car, looking confused, VERY scared, and surprised all at the same time. The driver looks at the guy, and says,  
""That was dumb, you know? Really dumb."".  
The guy thinks,  
""I'm not the one who almost killed two people..."".

After some time, the police arrives to deal with the situation. The guy thinks,  
""What was I thinking? I could've not only died myself, but it would also be useless since the car could've killed both of us..."".  
After the guy gets interrogated by the police, he sits down, and overhears the girl's parents conversation, which sounds more like arguing.  
Mother: ""She almost died. She's all I live for. And it's all your fault."".  
Father: ""My fault? How? You were the one that started arguing again! It's because of you, we started arguing instead of paying attention to our girl."".  
Mother: ""Oh yeah sure, it's all my fault now!"".  
Father: \*sigh\* ""Ok, calm down. It's no one's fault."".  
Mother: ""Then find her a man! She's 18 already, she needs to marry a wealthy and responsible man."".  
Father: ""Oh please, don't start this again. This topic was the very reason why this all happened."".

The parents get interrogated by the police. The girl is sitting and looking at the guy, still in shock. After her parents are done talking with the police, with a little bit of hesitation, they start walking towards the guy, who is also still very confused. The girl is looking out from behind her dad's back.  
The guy notices them, and he stands up.  
Mother: ""Why? Why did you..."".  
Father: ""It doesn't matter. You risked yourself for our girl, and I want to thank you."".  
Mother: ""You're right. Thank you... uh, what's your name?"".  
Guy: ""Guy."". (I haven't made a name for him yet (or for any character in general))  
Mother: ""Guy... thank you."".  
Father: ""Still. Why did you risk your life?"".  
Guy: ""Well... let's say, I was confident that I'll be able to pull it off, haha."".  
Father: ""Well, seems like you would've got hit by the car, so it wasn't exactly a success. Although, it was very brave of you, young man. Hey, you know what? Perhaps, you want to..."".  
The father looks at the mother, which is angrily staring at him.  
Father: ""Nevermind."".  
Guy: ""Oh, alright."".  
Mother: ""Anyway, thank you again, but we'll go now. Be careful on your way!""

The guy sighs, and after some time, finds a bench to sit on. Time to collect thoughts.  
""What did the father want to say? There's no way he wanted me to be his daughter's husband, haha..."".  
""It's still around 1 PM, but I think I should go home for now. That's enough adventures for today."".

After the guy returns home, he returns to his boring life, right after one of the most action-filled moments in his life. He stays in his room for the rest of the day.

On the next day's night, the guy is sleeping, but suddenly he wakes up. He sees a very weird little hexagon on the ceiling, and gets pulled to it by an invisible force. He eventually gets sucked into the hexagon, and appears in a huge room, decorated with very expensive stuff. That place is very weird, colored in red, a lot of gold, cyan and a little bit of white colors, with a rich architecture.  
The guy tries to escape, and finds two staircases that lead to a huge door at the top. After opening that door, the guy sees a room with just stairs going in circles, and they go very hight. He climbs up the stairs, getting tired after 20 seconds of doing so. He moves through sweat and pain, and finds a door with an ""Exit"" sign at the top of it.  
After entering it, he sees some sort of witch, which also sees the guy. After a second, the guy decides to run away to another door, but the witch smirks and seems calm. She puts some kind of spell on the guy before he leaves the room. Nothing seemed to happen after that spell, until very soon, while the guy is running, he starts to fade slowly.

When the guy starts seeing nothing, he tries to open his eyes, and finds himself in his room, on his bed, with the morning light pouring through the window.  
He thinks to himself,  
""So this was a dream. Well, it's kind of obvious. It felt very real though."".  
""I'll just stay lying for a minute..."".  
...  
After around 20 seconds of staring at the ceiling, the guy feels movement and hears sounds on the other side of his bed. He slowly turns around in fear, to find a girl lying beside him, completely naked. It is the same girl that he saw the day before, the girl that he risked his life for. The girl seems to be sleeping, but after a few seconds, wakes up with a stretch, turns around to face the guy, and sees him. After half a second, they both gasp, blush, and turn around at the same time. They then immediately look at each other again at the same time, and do the exact same thing again.  
The girl screams,  
""GET OUT, DON'T LOOK!"".  
The guy stays and thinks to himself,  
""A young girl... lying on my bed, completely naked. What is she doing here!? Wait, what if I just... NO. I have to get out until I do something horrible."".  
The girl: ""Do you even hear me!? I SAID, GET OUT!"".  
The guy continues thinking,  
""I... can't fight it. Let me just..."".  
The girl looks scared, as the guy starts approaching her and holding her arms down on the bed.  
The girl: ""What are you doing? Stop!"".  
The guy looks out of his mind, he is not in control anymore. He looks like he is on autopilot.  
The girl: ""I DO NOT CONSENT!"".  
Something clicks in the guy's head, he gets weaker for a moment. The girl uses the opportunity to punch him in the gut and get away to the other side of the room, covering herself.

\-----

That is all I had in my dream, at least all I can remember. I fixed a lot and added a lot, but the idea is the same. Maybe, just maybe, I will be adding more into this.

Also, I know that after this point, a lot of people are grossed out. I understand.

Oh, and my writing is also pretty bad. I'm not really an experienced writer or anything, but hope this community takes my writing well.

\-----

This is an idea for the rest of the story:

After the situation, the conversation shifts to the guy's loneliness and dark thoughts. The girl proposes the guy to fix his problems of loneliness, bad looks, and most importanly, his dark thoughts and impulses. Then, they get together often, and get closer and closer, as they try to fix the guy's problems.  
Sometimes, the girl would suddenly disappear when she's out of sight, even in places where she couldn't go anywhere else, but then after some time she reappears again with a believable reason to why she disappeared. She always seems to know exactly what the guy is thinking. Her advice feels strangely tailored to what he needs at that moment. She avoids direct questions about her life or family.

At the end of the story, when the guy seems to have finally fixed most of his problems, the girl says her last goodbyes to the guy, and he can already guess why. He looks sad, and asks, ""You're not real, are you?"" in the end, and she smiles in reply. She disappears in front of the guy, and he gets a flashback, when the driver of that one car said ""That was dumb."". He realizes that when it all started, he jumped under a car, and there was no one there. No parents, no girl. Only the car that was about to hit him. The arguing that he was hearing was from completely different people, and the actual arguing was a little different from what the guy hallucinated.

The story ends on that.

\-----

I recently watched Welcome to the N.H.K. and I really like the anime. I got a little inspired by it, so it's kinda similar. But anyway, I don't think this story is good enough to be something big, so I'll just post this here. I don't think I will be working on it anymore. But there is a chance.

Anyway, thanks for reading, bye!"

If this post is more than 48 hours old please do not reply to it, it might be outdated and I might no longer be looking for games in the title, please look for the most recent post instead.

I'VE BEEN SUBSCRIBED TO HUMBLE CHOICE FOR OVER 2 YEARS, ANY COMMENTS ASKING ""anything here (mostly choice games from the past few months or fanatical mystery trash) for this game"" WILL BE IGNORED

Primarily looking for the games in the title, if you post a list without the games from the title I want chances of me finding something I'm willing to trade for is low.

If you're not from EU I will only sell if you cover the paypal fees and pay in EUR instead of your native currency. I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC PRICE IN MIND, THE PRICE DEPENDS ON GREY MARKET PRICING BUT I'M OPEN TO OFFERS. Aside from games listed in the title I'm not very interested in offers for new games atm, even wishlisted ones

DO NOT send me a chat invite before having agreed on a trade in the comments. I do not check chat often and it's a rule to not send a chat invite before commenting anyway.

The Best Princess Party Themes for Denver Celebrations,u_Jinanlee,1i930f8,2025-01-24 13:58:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jinanlee/comments/1i930f8/the_best_princess_party_themes_for_denver/,Jinanlee,,"Hosting a princess party in Denver is an exciting way to celebrate your little one‚Äôs special day. With so many enchanting themes to choose from, the possibilities for creating a magical experience are endless. Whether you‚Äôre planning a simple gathering or a grand royal affair, a well-thought-out theme will make the day unforgettable. Here are some of the best princess party themes that will delight your child and guests alike.

# 1. Classic Fairy-Tale Princess Party

A timeless choice, the classic fairy-tale princess theme never goes out of style. This theme brings to life the magic of storybooks with castles, crowns, and royal gowns. Decorate with glittering gold and pastel hues, and create a regal atmosphere with castle-shaped backdrops and a throne for the birthday princess. Incorporate activities like storytime or crafting royal wands to keep the little guests entertained.

# 2. Enchanted Forest Theme

For a nature-inspired twist, an enchanted forest theme transforms your party into a magical woodland setting. Think twinkling fairy lights, leafy garlands, and soft, earthy tones. Add details like faux flowers, butterflies, and fairy wings to enhance the forest vibe. Activities can include building fairy houses, creating flower crowns, or a treasure hunt for hidden gems in your backyard or a Denver park.

# 3. Winter Wonderland Princess Party

Denver‚Äôs stunning winters make this theme an ideal choice, especially during colder months. Transform your venue into a snowy kingdom with white, silver, and icy blue decor. Use faux snow, snowflake cutouts, and shimmering fabric to create a frosty atmosphere. A hot cocoa bar and winter-themed crafts like decorating snowflake ornaments can keep the little ones warm and entertained.

# 4. Under-the-Sea Mermaid Princess Party

For a splash of magic, an under-the-sea theme is perfect for Denver kids who dream of being mermaid royalty. Decorate with shades of blue, purple, and teal, along with seashells, starfish, and shimmering balloons. Activities could include making seashell necklaces or a fun ‚Äúfishing‚Äù game. For food, serve snacks like ‚Äúocean jello‚Äù and cupcakes with mermaid tails.

# 5. Medieval Princess and Knights Party

Transport your celebration to medieval times with a princess-and-knights theme. This imaginative idea combines princesses, castles, and even dragons for an adventurous royal affair. Set up a castle-themed play area, and provide knight costumes or shields for the young warriors. You can also organize activities like ‚Äúdragon egg‚Äù hunts or a royal jousting game with pool noodles.

# 6. Royal Tea Party Theme

A royal tea party theme adds a touch of elegance to your Denver princess party. Set up small tables with fine china, tiered trays filled with finger sandwiches, and delicate pastries. Add floral centerpieces and pastel tablecloths to create a regal ambiance. Kids can dress in fancy gowns and hats, and you can include tea etiquette lessons or a cupcake-decorating activity.

# 7. Magical Unicorn Princess Party

Unicorns and princesses go hand in hand when it comes to enchanting themes. Deck your venue with rainbows, glitter, and lots of pastel colors. Unicorn balloons, streamers, and tableware can tie the theme together beautifully. Activities might include making unicorn headbands, face painting, or a pi√±ata filled with magical goodies.

# 8. Space Princess Adventure

For a unique and out-of-this-world experience, a space princess theme is perfect for adventurous little royals. Blend the wonder of space exploration with royal flair by using silver, purple, and blue decor with star and planet motifs. You can include fun activities like DIY rocket ship crafts, a space-themed photo booth, and a ‚Äúspace treasure‚Äù scavenger hunt.

# 9. Garden Princess Party

Celebrate the beauty of nature with a garden princess theme. Denver‚Äôs lovely spring and summer weather make this theme ideal for outdoor gatherings. Use floral decorations, butterfly motifs, and soft pastel colors to create an enchanting garden setting. Plan activities like planting flowers, painting flower pots, or hosting a butterfly-release ceremony.

# 10. Arabian Nights Princess Party

For a more exotic vibe, an Arabian Nights theme offers a rich and colorful experience. Decorate with jewel tones, draped fabrics, and gold accents. Create a cozy setting with pillows and rugs, and plan activities like henna-inspired crafts or a treasure hunt for jewels. This theme is perfect for imaginative storytelling and creating a magical, cultural experience.

# 11. Pirate and Princess Mash-Up

If your guest list includes kids who prefer pirates over princesses, a mash-up theme can make everyone happy. Combine pirate ships and treasure maps with royal castles and tiaras. Set up separate activity zones for pirate games and princess crafts, then bring everyone together for a treasure hunt or group dance party.

# 12. DIY Craft Princess Party

A craft-focused princess party is a wonderful way to keep kids engaged while unleashing their creativity. Provide materials for making tiaras, wands, or jewelry. Decorate tables with glitter, gemstones, and art supplies that match the princess theme. The kids can take home their creations as a fun and meaningful party favor.

# 13. Cultural Princess Celebrations

Celebrate diversity with a princess party theme inspired by different cultures. Choose a princess or royal tradition from around the world and incorporate elements like traditional music, decor, and food. This is a fantastic way to create a fun yet educational experience for the kids, while honoring cultural heritage.

# 14. Rainbow Princess Party

A rainbow princess theme is all about vibrant colors and joy. Use rainbow balloons, streamers, and tableware to create a cheerful atmosphere. Include activities like rainbow slime-making or creating colorful bead bracelets. A rainbow cake with layers of bright colors inside is sure to be a hit with the kids.

# 15. Vintage Princess Theme

Take your party back in time with a vintage-inspired princess theme. Use antique-style decor like lace, pearls, and ornate frames. Dress the birthday princess in a Victorian-style gown, and encourage guests to wear vintage outfits. Activities like designing old-fashioned fans or playing classic parlor games can add to the timeless charm.

No matter which theme you choose, the key to a successful celebration is tailoring the experience to your child‚Äôs interests and adding those magical touches that make the day truly special.

(Olsen's quotes generally taken from the autotranscript, lightly edited for fillers, repetitions and stutters.)

>Later on he \[Tolkien\] is going to have lots of speculations: Was there mithril in Numenor, was there mithril in Valinor. But I want to not think about that stuff. We have to, here, accept what Gandalf says:

The implication of mithril also in Valinor emerges with the various revisions to Errantry/Earendil was a Mariner:

*""His bow was made of dragon-horn,*

*his arrows shorn of ebony,*

*of mithril was his habergeon""*

...and:

*""His boat anew they built for him*

*of mithril and of elven-glass""*

The Collected Poems of J R R Tolkien, 128

(Hammond & Scull judge that the final version of the poem is from 1952)

Also, in initial drafts, mithril (under various names) is implied to be found (rarely) in places other than Moria:

*""But the mines were most renowned for the metal which was only found here in any quantity: Moria-silver, or true-silver as some call it. Ithil the Elves call it, and value it still above gold.""*

HoMe VI, The Story Continued, XXV

*""...only in Moria was mithril found save rarely and scantily.""*

CT notes:

*""It is still said that mithril was not found only in Moria: ‚ÄòHere alone in the world, save rarely and scantily in far eastern mountains, was found Moria-silver.‚Äô""*

*""It is quite possible, of course, that certain ‚Äòelements‚Äô or conditions of matter had attracted Morgoth‚Äôs special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own plans). For example, all gold (in Middle-earth) seems to have had a specially ‚Äòevil‚Äô trend ‚Äî* ***but not silver***\*. Water is represented as being almost entirely free of Morgoth.

>We have exactly two named characters of the Silvan Elves, Legolas' dad and Legolas' grandpa

>IGN The Lord of the Rings Expert Reacts to The Rings of Power

Referring to Thranduil and Oropher.

And they are Sindar, not Silvan Elves. But taking his assertion as correct, if they were Silvan, then so too would be Amroth and his father Amdir/Malgalad.

Still, this answer is false. Galion, the Elven-king's butler, is named in The Hobbit. In LotR, there are Haldir and his two brothers, Rumil and Orophin, as well as Amroth's lover, Nimrodel. And UT names Nimrodel's handmaiden, Mithrellas.

>Tolkien gives little description of even central characters. What colour is Merry's hair? No idea, he never says

IGN The Lord of the Rings Expert Reacts to The Rings of Power

Taking Olsen's assertion as fact, Tolkien does say of Hobbits ""the hair of their heads, which was commonly brown."" (LotR, Prologue)

Which, in the absence of an explicit description otherwise, should indicate that Merry's hair is brown.

And Olsen knows that as, in Exploring the Lord of the Rings - Episode 55, when asked about Frodo being ""fairer than most"" hobbits, he noted while fair can mean ""attractive"" or ""handsome"", that:

""...especially when used in a physical description like this, it probably just means that his hair is lighter color, because remember hobbits all have brown hair. That's sort of standard, so I think that he, Frodo, seems to have lighter color hair than most of them do. That would seem the simplest interpretation of that.""

Of course, Olsen is just plain wrong regarding Merry:

*""A young man he looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in height; his head of* ***brown curling hair*** *was uncovered...""*

The Road to Isengard

*""‚ÄòGladly will I take it,‚Äô said the king; and laying his long old hands upon* ***the brown hair*** *of the hobbit, he blessed him. ‚ÄòRise now, Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld!‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòTake your sword and bear it unto good fortune!‚Äô""*

The Passing of the Grey Company

*""Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry‚Äôs head, and passing his hand gently through* ***the brown curls***\*, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name.""\*

The Houses of Healing

>Question: I've seen a lot of people asking and even some complaining that Elrond doesn't have long flowing elvish hair what's up with that?

>Olsen: No, it's a Peter Jackson thing. We don't know anything about elf hair. Again we know something about the color of some of the elves hair, but we know literally nothing about how long their hair is. No reason to think that elves had long hair, no reason to think think they had short hair either, but that is totally not a book detail, that is absolutely a movie thing.

>I totally understand people who have grown up with the Peter Jackson films, and so like to them the visuals of the Elves, the long-haired Elves and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, that's what Elves look like, and so to have them not look like that is some kind of hideous violation, but it's not. It has nothing to do with the text

>IGN The Lord of the Rings Expert Reacts to The Rings of Power

Notice here the blame Jackson, while asserting that Tolkien does not tell us about Elf hair (then saying except colour), it is not in the text.

If it was a ""Jackson thing"", it is something Jackson was correct about.

And Olsen should know this.

He had read in Mythgard Academy: The Nature of Middle-earth - Session 13:

*""Finw√´ (and M√≠riel)* ***had long dark hair***\*, so had F√´anor and\* ***all the Noldor***\*, save by intermarriage...""\*

... about a month before (and even referred to what he had read in this specific episode in another point in the IGN video).

In LotR, Glorfindel is described as:

*""..his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed.""*

Elrond:

*""His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver...""*

Arwen:

*""The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost...""*

Note that:

*""...so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred...""*

Arwen, her hair braided, closely resembled her father (though in woman's form).

These thus all suggest long hair.

Nimrodel:

*""Her hair was long, her limbs were white""*

Amroth:

*""The wind was in his flowing hair,""*

Galadriel & Celeborn:

*""the hair of the Lady was of deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright""*

*""the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses""*

Whether stated or implied these are all indicative of long hair, in LotR.

Yet in OM&H #7 Olsen says:

And it is not the ""only time"" Tolkien ever addressed it:

>Tolkien never says female dwarves have beards

This encapsulates Olsen: make an assertion that Tolkien ""never"" says something that Tolkien does in fact say, (or the reverse, claim Tolkien does say something he does not). (And blame it on Jackson.) Often along with a mis-characterization about what Tolkien does say:

>he says they rarely wander around, and when they do they're often mistaken for dwarven-men. Meaning they keep to themselves and you don't know that it's a woman

What Tolkien says of dwarf-women:

*""They seldom walk abroad except at great need,* ***They are in voice and appearance***\*, and in garb if they must go on a journey,\* ***so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart.****""*

*""Indeed this strangeness they have that no Man nor Elf has ever seen a beardless Dwarf - unless he were shaven in mockery, and would then be more like to die of shame than of many other hurts that to us would seem more deadly.

>Dol Amroth is about the latitude of Morocco

>Hobbits in the Second Age? The Tolkien Professor Corey Olsen on possibilities for the Amazon show, youtube channel of The Clueless Fangirl

>For instance, Dol Amroth, according to Tolkien's notes about latitude, would be somewhere around the latitude of Morocco.

>Signum University, The Tolkien Professor's Reddit AMA in rtolkienfans

>When he was writing doing his maps, for instance, he said things like so Minas Tirith is about the latitude of central Italy, and Umbar, the city down in the south where the Southrons come from, is about the latitude of Carthage in North Africa. In other words, all of the southern front of the Lord of the Rings right Gondor and all of that so that means that Dol Amroth down on the southern shore of Gondor would have been about the latitude of like Morocco, southern Spain, perhaps.

>IGN The Lord of the Rings Expert Reacts to The Rings of Power

No. Just No.

Morocco latitude: 31.7917

Tangier, Morocco latitude: 35.7595

Malaga, Spain latitude: 36.7178

Granada, Spain latitude: 37.1825

Carthage latitude: 36.8551

The self-declared ""Tolkien Professor"", by claiming that Umbar is at the latitude of Cathage, is placing it north of Dol Amroth, which he usually claims is at the latitude of Morocco, or maybe southern Spain. Even the main northern city of Tangier is a degree of latitude south of Carthage.

Going with Olsen's 'maybe southern Spain', even that is south of Carthage, until you get north up into Granada.

In fact, he mis-represents what 'Tolkien's notes' say:

*""The action of the story takes place in the North-west of ‚ÄòMiddle-earth‚Äô, equivalent in latitude to the coastlands of Europe and the north shores of the Mediterranean. But this is not a purely ‚ÄòNordic‚Äô area in any sense. If Hobbiton and Rivendell are taken (as intended) to be at about the latitude of Oxford, then Minas Tirith, 600 miles south, is at about the latitude of Florence. The Mouths of Anduin and the ancient city of Pelargir are at about the latitude of ancient Troy.""*

Letter 294

...and:

*""Minas Tirith is about the latitude of Ravenna (that is 900 miles east of Hobbiton or near Belgrade). Bottom of the map (1450 miles) is about the latitude of Jerusalem. Umbar the city of Corsairs ‚Äì about that of Cyprus.""*

Note on the Baynes Map

Florence, Ravenna and Belgrade are at latitudes of:

43.7700, 44.4184 and 44.8125 (note that Tolkien referred to the longitude of Belgrade), respectively.

Troy latitude: 39.5727

Cyprus latitude: 35.1264

Limassol (southern Cypress): 34.6786

Kyrenia (northern Cypress): 35.3323

Jerusalem latitude: 31.7683

As best I can make it, Pelargir and Dol Amroth both seem to be about 125 miles south of Minas Tirith. The Mouths of the Anduin about 190 miles and Umbar about 550 miles south of Minas Tirith.

The latitude of Troy is too far south by 2-3 degrees to fit with even the mouths of the Anduin, and certainly not Pelargir. Umbar would be about 8 degrees south of Minas Tirith. So Cypress would be approximately correct.

That the name 'Tom Bambadil' is late is evident even from LotR, where Elrond says:

*""Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council.""*

The Akallabeth

>Tar-Palantir was named Tar-Palantir before Tolkien invented the palantiri

The palantiri seem to have been 'invented' in 1942-44 (see HoMe VII and VIII), while Tar-Palantir only seems to emerge with The Akallabeth and Appendix A (post DAII and FNIII, see HoMe IX and XII).

>The interesting thing is that there is a palantir in The Lord of the Rings that fits that description. There is a stone set on a tower in the west coast of Middle Earth and it only looks back across the sea at Numenor

No, ""it only looks back across the sea at"" Tol Eress√´a:

*""But we are told that it was unlike the others and not in accord with them; it looked only to the Sea.* ***Elendil set it there so that he could look back with ‚Äòstraight sight‚Äô and see Eress√´a*** *in the vanished West; but the bent seas below covered N√∫menor for ever.""*

>The Valar passed a rule called the ban of the Valar that forbade the Numenoreans to sail west towards Valinor. The whole ocean west of the island was a no sail Zone

No. They could sail west, as long as they remained within sight of Numenor.

*""But the Lords of Valinor forbade them to sail so far westward that the coasts of N√∫menor could no longer be seen...""*

The Akallabeth

*""...in those days the N√∫men√≥reans were far-sighted; yet even so it was only the keenest eyes among them that could see this vision, from the Meneltarma, maybe, or from some tall ship that lay off their western coast as far as it was lawful for them to go.""*

The Akallabeth

>Numenor is on the equator, so when we meet the Numenoreans in theory they will have been a culture living on the equator for thousands of years I see no reason to think based, you know, from Tolkien's story that they should be Viking looking white folks.

>IGN The Lord of the Rings Expert Reacts to The Rings of Power

That Numenor is on the equator is an assumption. It is generally taken from maps of Arda that Tolkien made before he had even invented Numenor.

Even with those maps (see HoMe IV), Numenor would be north of the equator. But granting Olsen's assertion of Numenor being in a roughly equatorial region, Numenor's climate is not equatorial, but rather temperate:

*""Now aforetime in the isle of N√∫menor the weather was ever apt to the needs and liking of Men: rain in due season and ever in measure; and sunshine, now warmer, now cooler, and winds from the sea. And when the wind was in the west, it seemed to many that it was filled with a fragrance, fleeting but sweet, heart-stirring, as of flowers that bloom for ever in undying meads and have no names on mortal shores.""*

The Akallabeth

(as for ""Viking looking white folks"", the stereotypical ""Viking"" is a blue-eyed blond, and the Numenorean population was majority Hadorian, who were blue-eyed blondes, and ""white"").

>Tolkien never explains why Sauron does what he does. Sauron in the book is just the Dark Lord.

>Rings and Realms S02E01

Tolkien seems to 'never say' a lot of things he actually says:

*""Seeing the desolation of the world, Sauron said in his heart that the Valar, having overthrown Morgoth, had again forgotten Middle-earth; and his pride grew apace. He looked with hatred on the Eldar, and he feared the Men of N√∫menor who came back at whiles in their ships to the shores of Middle-earth; but for long he dissembled his mind and concealed the dark designs that he shaped in his heart.""*

The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age

*""Sauron, however, inherited the ‚Äòcorruption‚Äô of Arda, and only spent his (much more limited) power on the Rings; for it was the creatures of earth, in their minds and wills, that he desired to dominate.""*

Morgoth's Ring, MT VII, Notes on motives in the Silmarillion

*""Sauron had never reached this stage of nihilistic madness. He did not object to the existence of the world, so long as he could do what he liked with it. He still had the relics of positive purposes, that descended from the good of the nature in which he began: it had been his virtue (and therefore also the cause of his fall, and of his relapse) that he loved order and coordination, and disliked all confusion and wasteful friction.""*

ibid.

*""But like all minds of this cast, Sauron‚Äôs love (originally) or (later) mere understanding of other individual intelligences was correspondingly weaker; and though the only real good in, or rational motive for, all this ordering and planning and organization was the good of all inhabitants of Arda (even admitting Sauron‚Äôs right to be their supreme lord), his ‚Äòplans‚Äô, the idea coming from his own isolated mind, became the sole object of his will, and an end, the End, in itself.\*""*

*""\*\[footnote to the text\] But his capability of corrupting other minds, and even engaging their service, was a residue from the fact that his original desire for ‚Äòorder‚Äô had really envisaged the good estate (especially physical well-being) of his ‚Äòsubjects‚Äô.""*

>Nerd of the Rings The Tolkien Professor, Dr. Corey Olsen - Livestream Q&A

The Akallabeth does not say Sauron set aside the One Ring and went to Numenor, it says he took it up again after the Downfall:

*""But Sauron was not of mortal flesh, and though he was robbed now of that shape in which he had wrought so great an evil, so that he could never again appear fair to the eyes of Men, yet his spirit arose out of the deep and passed as a shadow and a black wind over the sea, and came back to Middle-earth and to Mordor that was his home. There he took up again his great Ring in Barad-d√ªr, and dwelt there, dark and silent, until he wrought himself a new guise, an image of malice and hatred made visible...""*

The Akallabeth

It is also not ""the only thing we get"". There is this from Letters:

*""Ar-Pharaz√¥n, as is told in the ‚ÄòDownfall‚Äô or Akallab√™th, conquered or terrified Sauron‚Äôs subjects, not Sauron. Sauron‚Äôs personal ‚Äòsurrender‚Äô was voluntary and cunning: he got free transport to N√∫menor!* ***He naturally had the One Ring, and so very soon dominated the minds and wills of most of the N√∫men√≥reans.****""*

I can't think off the top of my head of any other time I've ever seen Tolkien do that; talk about ""my world"". Now he does put it in quotation marks, right; he does kind of distance himself from that idea that he has ""a world"".

Also the word 'Uruks is an anglicized form of Uruk-hai:

*""Uruks  Anglicized form of Uruk-hai of the Black Speech; a race of Orcs of great size and strength.""*

>Maggie: ""Do we know what happens to the shieldmaidens between Eowyn and Hera? Is there any kind of history?""

>Olsen: ""No. All we have is Tolkien... the most we get, frustratingly, is actually from Tolkien's drafts. Tolkien contemplated having a bunch of shieldmaidens show up at the muster of Rohan. To have that be a thing. It is like an established thing that there is a subset of the women of Rohan who act as shieldmaidens, and Eowyn was just going to be one of them. He cut that...""

>OM&H 87

No. That is not what happened.

Here is the passage Olsen seems to be referring to:

*""√âowyn says that women must ride now, as they did in a like evil time in the days of Brego son of \[mark showing name omitted\] Eorl‚Äôs son, when the wild men of the East came from the Inland Sea into the Eastemnet.""*

HoMe VIII, Part 3, II, ii The Muster of Rohan

The correct answer to Maggie is ""No"" (because there is no character named ""Hera"" and WotR is not ""history"").

Even utilizing the passage referred to, the 'shieldmaidens' would have been near 2 centuries before Helm's death:

*2512-70 2. Brego. He drove the enemy out of the Wold, and Rohan was not attacked again for many years.*

*2691-2759 9. Helm Hammerhand. At the end of his reign Rohan suffered great loss, by invasion and the Long Winter. Helm and his sons Haleth and H√°ma perished. Fr√©al√°f, Helm‚Äôs sister‚Äôs son, became king.*

*LotR, App. A II, Kings of the Mark*

And what Tolkien seems to have 'contemplated' was having Eowyn suggest calling up women, not having some established group of shieldmaidens join.

>In other words, that's where the Rohirrim come from. From the people of Bor.

>War of the Jewels series Session 4

*""Indeed it is said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the N√∫men√≥reans in their beginning; not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his people as went not over Sea into the West, refusing the call.""*

LotR, Window on the West

*""Most of the Men of the northern regions of the West-lands were descended from the Edain of the First Age, or from their close kin. \[...\] From the lands between the Gladden and the Carrock came the folk that were known in Gondor as the Rohirrim, Masters of Horses. They still spoke their ancestral tongue, and gave new names in it to nearly all the places in their new country; and they called themselves the Eorlings, or the Men of the Riddermark.""*

App. F I, Of Men

The Rohirrim (tall, fair, blue-eyed blondes) are descended from the Marachian/Hadorian Edain, not the folk of Bor (short, swarthy or sallow, dark-haired and -eyed).

>The land where the Rohirrim lived. It was the Eotheod, that's the word I was blanking. The people of the Eotheod before they came down, before Eorl the Young brought them down. Them and the Breelanders I think would both count as living in the north of Eriador.

>War of the Jewels series Session 4

Eriador is the lands west of the Misty Mountains:

*""Eriador was of old the name of all the lands between the Misty Mountains and the Blue...""*

LotR, App. A I, iii

...while Eotheod was east of the Misty Mountains:

*""Eorl the Young was lord of the Men of √âoth√©od. That land lay near the sources of Anduin, between the furthest ranges of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost parts of Mirkwood.""*

LotR, App. A II

>""That same passage where he \[Gandalf\] talks about his many names he says: ""To the East, I go not.""

>When we look at that quote in context, he's talking to a dude from Gondor, and the people of Gondor. They call Mordor ""the East"".

>He meant: ""Don't expect me to go throw down with, you know, the Dark Lord at the gates of Barad-dur.""""

>Amazon 'no canon' video

The passage referred to:

*""‚ÄòMithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,‚Äô said Faramir, ‚Äòand he was content. Many are my names in many countries, he said. Mithrandir among the Elves, Thark√ªn to the Dwarves; Ol√≥rin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Inc√°nus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.‚Äô""*

LotR, Window on the West

Tolkien writes that it means:

*""...* ***Beyond N√∫rnen Gandalf had never gone.****""*

Unfinished Tales, The Istari, a pre- 2nd edition of Lord of the Rings note

and:

***""Gandalf disclaimed ever visiting ‚Äòthe East‚Äô****, but actually* ***he appears to have confined his journeys and guardianship to the western lands***\*, inhabited by Elves and peoples in general hostile to Sauron.""\*

Unfinished Tales, The Istari, 1967 note

>Tom Bombadil says that he came to Arda, that he came to Middle Earth, to that place in Middle Earth, in the beginning before Morgoth came into the world. In other words he seems to have arrived in Middle Earth at the same time as the Valar, and the Maiar who came with them. Now that doesn't mean that he's necessarily one of the Maiar in the sense of being if you define Maiar as one of those spirits who were sort of affiliated with the Valar.  
D√ºnyaca √únl√º The Tolkien Professor ile Orta D√ºnya R√∂portajƒ± (Dr. Corey Olsen) - Y√ºz√ºklerin Efendisi

No, Bombadil does not say that he came to Middle-earth, he says he was ""here"":

*‚ÄòEh, what?‚Äô said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you know my name yet? That‚Äôs the only answer. Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that‚Äôs what I am. Mark my words, my friends:* ***Tom was here*** *before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless ‚Äì before the Dark Lord came from Outside.‚Äô*

...not that he came from the Outside.

What Makes Jewelry Mixed Lots a Perfect Gift Option for Jewelry Lovers?,u_shahla_naz,1i90qo1,2025-01-24 12:24:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_shahla_naz/comments/1i90qo1/what_makes_jewelry_mixed_lots_a_perfect_gift/,shahla_naz,,"Gift-giving is a heartfelt gesture that lets us express love, gratitude, and appreciation. When it comes to gifting jewelry, the stakes feel even higher because it‚Äôs not just about aesthetics- it‚Äôs about value, sentiment, and individuality. If you‚Äôre searching for a gift that combines these qualities while being budget-friendly, unique, and versatile, [**jewelry mixed lots**](https://www.truegether.com/category/jewelry-watches) are the ideal solution.

https://preview.redd.it/qwrl6r1j7zee1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fef2b5226ffd70afb03e09b994e8399a9480498

**What Are Jewelry Mixed Lots?**

Jewelry mixed lots are collections of assorted jewelry pieces sold together as a single package. These lots often contain a variety of items, including necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings, brooches, and more. What sets them apart is their unpredictability‚Äîeach lot can be a treasure trove of unique pieces. Some include brand-new items, while others may feature vintage, pre-owned, or artisan-crafted pieces.

According to a 2023 report by Statista, the global jewelry market is projected to reach $307 billion by 2026, with the demand for unique, sustainable, and affordable options growing significantly. Jewelry mixed lots fit right into this trend, making them an attractive option for gifting.

**1. Endless Variety: The Gift That Keeps on Giving**

One of the biggest draws of jewelry mixed lots is the variety they offer. Unlike gifting a single necklace or bracelet, mixed lots allow recipients to explore multiple styles, colors, and designs. This variety ensures that there‚Äôs something for every mood, outfit, or occasion.

For instance, a jewelry lover who enjoys mixing and matching accessories can use pieces from a mixed lot to create unique combinations. This versatility transforms a single gift into an ongoing experience of discovery and creativity.

Did you know? According to a survey by NRF, 65% of consumers prefer gifts that offer personalization or creative freedom, making jewelry mixed lots a perfect choice for today‚Äôs gifting trends.

**2. Affordable Yet Luxurious**

Finding a gift that feels luxurious without breaking the bank can be challenging. Jewelry mixed lots bridge this gap beautifully. By purchasing a collection of items in bulk, you often pay a fraction of the price you would for individual pieces.

For example, while a single designer bracelet could cost upwards of $100, a mixed lot containing 15-20 items might be available for the same price. This affordability doesn‚Äôt compromise quality‚Äîmany lots include high-end materials like sterling silver, gemstones, or even gold-plated items.

In 2022, IBISWorld reported that the average American spent $764 on holiday gifts, with jewelry being one of the top three most popular categories. Mixed lots provide an affordable way to give high-value gifts without exceeding your budget.

**3. The Joy of Surprise**

There‚Äôs an undeniable thrill in the unexpected, and jewelry mixed lots deliver that in spades. Opening a mixed lot feels like unwrapping a treasure chest‚Äîit‚Äôs an adventure full of surprises. This element of mystery adds a layer of excitement to the gift, making it memorable and unique.

Psychologists have found that surprise gifts trigger stronger emotional responses, creating lasting memories for both the giver and the recipient. By gifting a jewelry mixed lot, you‚Äôre not just giving accessories; you‚Äôre gifting an experience.

**4. Perfect for All Occasions**

Jewelry mixed lots are suitable for various occasions, from birthdays and anniversaries to holidays and ‚Äújust because‚Äù moments. Their diverse contents allow recipients to find pieces that resonate with specific events or outfits.

For example:

* A delicate pendant for a romantic dinner.
* Bold statement earrings for a party.
* A classic bracelet for everyday wear.

This flexibility makes mixed lots a practical and thoughtful choice for jewelry enthusiasts who value having options for every occasion.

**5. Sustainability: A Gift with a Conscience**

In today‚Äôs world, sustainability is more important than ever. Many jewelry mixed lots include vintage or pre-loved items, promoting the reuse and repurposing of materials. By gifting such a lot, you contribute to reducing waste and supporting a circular economy.

According to a study by McKinsey, 71% of consumers under 35 are willing to pay more for sustainable products. Jewelry mixed lots often meet this demand while being more affordable than brand-new luxury items.

Additionally, some lots come with opportunities for creative upcycling. For example, recipients can repurpose broken pieces into new designs or incorporate them into DIY projects. This adds a personal touch and aligns with the growing trend of eco-conscious gifting.

**6. A Treasure Trove for Collectors**

Jewelry lovers with a penchant for vintage or rare pieces will appreciate the thrill of discovering hidden gems in a mixed lot. Many lots include unique or one-of-a-kind items that are no longer in production, making them valuable additions to a collector‚Äôs inventory.

For example, a 2021 analysis of online auction platforms found that vintage jewelry lots frequently include pieces from iconic eras, such as Art Deco or mid-century modern, which are highly sought after by collectors.

**7. Encouraging Self-Expression**

Jewelry is deeply personal‚Äîit reflects one‚Äôs personality, style, and mood. Mixed lots encourage self-expression by providing a wide array of styles to experiment with. From bohemian beads to classic pearls, recipients can mix and match to create looks that feel authentic to them.

A 2024 survey by Fashion Insights found that 78% of consumers prioritize individuality in their fashion choices. By gifting a mixed lot, you empower your loved ones to embrace their unique style and showcase their creativity.

**How to Choose the Right Jewelry Mixed Lot**

To ensure your gift is well-received, consider the following tips when selecting a jewelry mixed lot:

1.¬†¬†¬† **Understand their preferences:** Take note of the recipient‚Äôs favorite metals (gold, silver, etc.), colors, and styles.

2.¬†¬†¬† **Check the description:** Look for lots that specify the type and condition of items included.

3.¬†¬†¬† **Research sellers:** Opt for reputable sellers or marketplaces with positive reviews to ensure quality.

4.¬†¬†¬† **Add a personal touch:** Pair the lot with a handwritten note or a small jewelry box for presentation.

How to Plan the Perfect Princess Party in Cincinnati,u_erepresent,1i8zdyk,2025-01-24 11:29:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i8zdyk/how_to_plan_the_perfect_princess_party_in/,erepresent,,"Planning a magical princess party for your little one is an exciting adventure filled with tiaras, glitter, and all things enchanting! Cincinnati offers a variety of ways to make your celebration truly memorable. Whether you're dreaming of transforming your space into a royal castle or hosting the party outdoors, here's how to plan the perfect princess party in Cincinnati, step by step.

# 1. Choose the Perfect Venue

The venue sets the tone for the party. If you have enough space at home, consider transforming your living room or backyard into a royal kingdom. For larger parties, renting a local event space in Cincinnati can be a great option. Look for venues that are kid-friendly, spacious, and can accommodate your theme. Parks and community centers are also excellent choices if you're planning an outdoor celebration.

# 2. Pick a Magical Theme

Every princess party needs a theme. While a general ""princess"" theme works, you could also tailor it around your child's favorite princess or story. Think of a fairy-tale forest, an ice castle, or a glittery ballroom. Once you‚Äôve chosen the theme, base your decorations, costumes, and activities around it to tie everything together seamlessly.

# 3. Send Royal Invitations

Make sure your little guests feel like royalty from the moment they receive their invitation. You can craft elegant, personalized invitations using pastel colors, glitter, and fancy fonts. Include details like the date, time, location, and any dress code (like dressing up as their favorite princess or prince). To make it extra fun, call it a ‚ÄúRoyal Ball‚Äù on the invite!

# 4. Plan the Decorations

For a princess party, the decorations should be enchanting and whimsical. Use lots of pinks, purples, golds, and silvers. Hang up banners, balloons, and streamers in matching colors. Table settings can include sparkly tablecloths, crown-shaped centerpieces, and elegant dinnerware. Fairy lights and faux flower arrangements can add an extra magical touch. Don‚Äôt forget to have a designated throne area for the birthday child‚Äîit‚Äôll make them feel extra special!

# 5. Create a Dress Code

What‚Äôs a princess party without gorgeous costumes? Ask your guests to dress up as their favorite royal character. The birthday child can wear a special gown or outfit to stand out as the star of the day. Provide inexpensive tiaras, capes, or crowns for guests who might not have costumes‚Äîit‚Äôs a simple yet thoughtful way to make everyone feel included.

# 6. Plan Fun Princess Activities

The key to any successful party is keeping the little ones entertained! Cincinnati has plenty of kid-friendly activities you can incorporate into your party:

* **Royal Craft Station**: Set up a table where kids can decorate their own tiaras, crowns, or wands.
* **Storytime with a Princess**: Read a magical princess tale or hire a storyteller to bring the magic to life.
* **Dance Party**: Play some fairy-tale music and let the kids have their own royal ball.
* **Face Painting**: Add a touch of magic by painting sparkly designs or princess characters on the kids' faces.

# 7. Plan a Royal Feast

The menu should match the party theme and be simple enough for little hands to enjoy. Think cupcakes topped with crowns, ‚Äúmagic wand‚Äù pretzels, and cookies shaped like castles. For drinks, serve pink lemonade or ‚Äúfairy punch‚Äù in glittery cups. A princess-themed cake is the centerpiece of the table, so consider one shaped like a castle or featuring your child‚Äôs favorite princess.

# 8. Include a Photo Opportunity

Every great party needs a photo op! Create a backdrop with sparkly curtains, balloon garlands, and props like royal thrones or enchanted forests. Parents will love snapping pictures of their kids dressed up in their princess best, and these moments will make wonderful keepsakes.

# 9. Give Out Royal Party Favors

Send your little guests home with a token of appreciation. Party favors like mini tiaras, magic wands, stickers, or small toys work perfectly. Wrap them in glittery bags or boxes for an extra special touch. Personalized ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù notes from the birthday child can add a sweet and memorable gesture.

# 10. Make It Extra Special

To make your princess party unforgettable, consider adding a unique surprise. A princess character appearance, a mini magic show, or even a small treasure hunt can bring an extra layer of excitement to the day. Cincinnati offers various resources for interactive entertainment, so take advantage of what the city has to offer!

# Conclusion

Hosting the perfect princess party in Cincinnati is all about creating magical memories that will last a lifetime. With the right planning, you can turn your child‚Äôs special day into an enchanting experience filled with laughter and wonder. Whether it‚Äôs the sparkling decorations, fun activities, or the look on their face when they wear their favorite princess dress, the effort is truly worth it.

Anyone Share My Picky Taste in Games?,macgaming,1i8y93m,2025-01-24 10:40:56,0,0.32,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1i8y93m/anyone_share_my_picky_taste_in_games/,bread-it,Discussion,"I strongly dislike 95% of computer games. But I really love the ones I love. Maybe some of you share my taste, and we can swap tips. The rest of you, as you were! :)

# What I Like:

I like games that are unique from the ground up, not just a variant on a genre (exception for extremely creative,  perfectly-tuned genre games like Alto's Adventure, Subway Surfers, Bioshock, Pack-Man 256, Inside, MiniSquadron). Uniqueness, though, isn't enough. It's also got to be infectiously great. This is why I like so few games! :)

I appreciate originality, attention to detail, high-quality writing, and careful tuning. So I love  Laya's Horizon, Strategery, Osmos, ""Miyamoto"", Fallout Shelter, Flow Free, A Dark Room, Sid Meier's Pirates, I Dig It, Universal Paperclips, Tetris, Bugdom (and anything else from Pangea), ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!"" (original version), and all the Infocom adventures.

A lot of those titles are older or ancient. Nothing against modern high-res games, but they tend to be imitative/genre (""like GTA but with submarines""), to protect the dev investment. Bleh.

# What I Dislike:

I dislike games where I need to develop expertise. I'd rather learn French or cello in the real world. Fallout Shelter represented the most learning I want to undergo to play a game. SIMS are ok-ish. Civilization is over the line.

Some combat is okay, but I dislike games that are mostly combat/shooting.

I don't like dungeon level games. Hated Infinity Blade.

Perfunctory writing (especially clich√©d mythologies) drives me nuts.

Puzzle box games like Myst leave me frustrated and googling solutions.

=======================

*Edit: Ooh! I ran the above by chatGPT, and got back a gold mine of tips*!

You have an¬†**extremely refined and discerning**¬†taste in games, which makes recommendations tricky but fun. You like¬†**truly original, impeccably designed, and highly polished**¬†games, but without excessive complexity, grinding, or genre tropes. Based on that, here are some games that I think fit your preferences:

# Deeply Original, Highly Polished, and Infectiously Great

1. **Baba Is You**¬†(PC, Switch, iOS, Android) ‚Äì A¬†**truly unique puzzle game**¬†where you manipulate the game‚Äôs rules by pushing words around. Every level is a mind-blowing moment of discovery.
2. **Return of the Obra Dinn**¬†(PC, Mac, Switch, PS4, Xbox) ‚Äì A¬†**one-of-a-kind detective game**where you reconstruct the fate of a lost ship. Uses a stark monochrome aesthetic and an ingenious deduction mechanic.
3. **Outer Wilds**¬†(PC, Mac via emulation, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**nonlinear, time-loop exploration game**¬†that gradually reveals its mysteries through discovery rather than puzzles or grinding. If you ever wanted a¬†*truly*¬†unique game, this is it.
4. **What Remains of Edith Finch**¬†(PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**beautifully written interactive story**¬†that plays with different gameplay mechanics in each chapter. Short but unforgettable.
5. **ElecHead**¬†(PC, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**minimalist yet brilliant puzzle-platformer**¬†where your character¬†**conducts electricity**¬†by touching walls, creating clever interactions.
6. **Superliminal**¬†(PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**perspective-based puzzle game**¬†where the world bends around optical illusions.
7. **Papers, Please**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, PS Vita) ‚Äì A¬†**bureaucratic dystopian thriller**¬†where you play as an immigration officer. Sounds mundane but becomes deeply compelling.

# Casual Yet Smart & Well-Tuned

1. **Holedown**¬†(PC, iOS, Android) ‚Äì A¬†**brilliant physics-based ball-bouncing game**¬†with an addictive loop and satisfying tuning.
2. **Hidden Folks**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**hand-drawn, interactive ""Where‚Äôs Waldo?"" game**¬†with tons of charm.
3. **Desert Golfing**¬†(PC, iOS, Android) ‚Äì Utterly¬†**minimalist but weirdly compelling**.
4. **Mini Metro**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**stylish transit simulation game**¬†where you create subway networks.
5. **Mini Motorways**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Switch) ‚Äì The¬†**spiritual successor to Mini Metro**, focusing on roads instead.
6. **Threes!**¬†(PC, iOS, Android) ‚Äì The¬†**original**¬†elegantly simple tile-merging puzzle game (not 2048, which ripped it off).

# Experimental, Thoughtful, & Short but Memorable

1. **The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe**¬†(PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**hilarious and self-aware game about choice and narrative**.
2. **Journey**¬†(PC, PS4, PS5, iOS) ‚Äì A¬†**wordless but emotionally powerful adventure**.
3. **Minit**¬†(PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**quirky RPG where you die every 60 seconds**¬†but carry progress forward.
4. **Donut County**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì¬†**Katamari-like**, where you control a hole that swallows everything.
5. **Sayonara Wild Hearts**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**rhythm-action game disguised as a dreamlike pop album**.
6. **Gorogoa**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**stunning hand-drawn puzzle game**¬†that plays like an interactive graphic novel.

# Weird, One-of-a-Kind Games That Might Click

1. **Slay the Spire**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**roguelike card game**¬†that is¬†**hyper-polished and strategic but not overly complex**.
2. **Katamari Damacy Reroll**¬†(PC, PS4, Xbox, Switch) ‚Äì¬†**Roll up the world into a ball**¬†in this delightfully weird and addictive cult classic.
3. **Wilmot‚Äôs Warehouse**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**puzzle game disguised as warehouse management**.
4. **The Witness**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, PS4, Xbox) ‚Äì A¬†**puzzle game with no instructions, forcing you to learn its language**. You hate Myst-style puzzles, but¬†*this one*¬†teaches logic through experience, which you might appreciate.

# Bonus: Great Infocom-Style Interactive Fiction

1. **80 Days**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**narrative-driven globe-trotting adventure**based on¬†*Around the World in 80 Days*.
2. **Heaven‚Äôs Vault**¬†(PC, Mac, iOS, PS4, Switch) ‚Äì A¬†**linguistic archaeology game**¬†where you uncover an ancient language.

# TL;DR

If you want¬†**pure infectious brilliance**¬†like¬†*Osmos*¬†and¬†*Laya‚Äôs Horizon*, start with:

* **Baba Is You**
* **Outer Wilds**
* **Return of the Obra Dinn**
* **Papers, Please**
* **ElecHead**
* **Superliminal**
* **Holedown**
* **Mini Metro**
* **The Stanley Parable**

If you want something¬†**surprisingly thoughtful but easy to pick up**, try:

* **Hidden Folks**
* **Mini Motorways**
* **Threes!**
* **Journey**
* **Donut County**
* **Sayonara Wild Hearts**
* **Minit**
* **Gorogoa**"

LTJ #14: Generic Macabre Carnival,JumpChain,1i8xxuw,2025-01-24 10:27:21,26,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1i8xxuw/ltj_14_generic_macabre_carnival/,Sin-God,BUILD,"It‚Äôs been a while since a generic was the central focus, but today we‚Äôre visiting [Generic Macabre Carnival](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18K1bkdZ11Y55ghvxWNTDr14fzR86rG5i/view?usp=sharing).

Scenario: Desde Abajo De Devora (Gotta feed that carnival, bud)

Starting Location: Lakeland Florida

**Story Notes**

LTJ and their eerie carnival pops up in Lakeland Florida in, let‚Äôs say 2009. The carnival itself is not a small thing, employing over 100 people. LTJ‚Äôs eyes open up in a rather nice looking room in one of the residence tents near a set of train tracks where the *Steam Smoke and Steel* carnival feature is presently located. LTJ‚Äôs first order of business is to summon some of¬† their securitrons and to program them to patrol the carnival grounds. At the same time a clone of theirs is conjured and ordered to invisibly patron the carnival grounds. During this time they get to spy many of the features of the carnival (which I invested a good deal of points into), and also come across the Whiteface Clown. They order the clown to be ready for a chance to spread violence and to keep an eye out for someone abusive to sacrifice to the carnival. The clown, loyal to LTJ thanks to LTJ‚Äôs nature as the master of the carnival, nods and prepares himself.¬†

LTJ masterfully performs that very night, and their incredible charisma allows them to effortlessly entertain the crowd (and they minorly use emotivore, enjoying the ability and how it meshes with their charisma) and their clown minion successfully identifies a few applicable targets for the carnival. The eerie follower of LTJ picks one person and nabs them, taking them to the ringmaster‚Äôs quarters for the sacrifice. LTJ successfully performs the sacrifice, sating the carnival for now, and also activating the *A Wish For Peace* perk which undoes some of the evil done by the abusive husband the carnival is now feeding on.¬†

After the ritual LTJ meets with the other members of the carnival and has a business meeting to discuss where they should go next. The plan is to stay in Florida for two weeks before moving elsewhere along the east coast, and during that time Madam Octa exerts her influence and authority, which LTJ patiently accepts. Some peeps have questions about the robots, but when LTJ uses their charisma everyone just accepts LTJ‚Äôs science-y explanation.¬†

LTJ‚Äôs carnival successfully performs for the next few weeks, while easily dealing with the drawbacks we‚Äôve taken and keeping the carnival sated. Clones wander towns in other states and kidnap people that they place in LTJ‚Äôs inventory for use in the sacrificial ritual. Additionally, a clone tends to one of the bars located in North Carolina, and that particular clone also allows the companions from Fallout New Vegas to chill and go on adventures of their own. Cassidy relaxes and spends her days guarding the bar, while Arcade opens a clinic and Lily enjoys some youth and a human alt-form that LTJ gives her at the start of the jump.¬†

About three months into their stay in this setting, LTJ encounters the first of the spooky ghosts they need to capture per the *Chest of Demons* drawback. Armed with their magitech *Atomic Blaster* (which has long since been enchanted to be able to do stuff to ghosts and other incorporeal beings), the help of their clown minion, and the assistance of a plucky band of mystery solvers, they manage to trick and contain the ghost. Over the next year they encounter three more ghosts, and have wacky misadventures with their companions, including their Fallout friends, to contain them. At about 15 months into their stay in this setting, and after dozens of sacrifices, LTJ and their carnival crew decide to go west with their carnival, moving from Vermont through the upper part of the country. They encounter more ghosts as they spend the next three years leisurely traveling from Vermont to Washington state. Along the way LTJ uses assorted Fallout followers to add science and medicine to their carnival, often having a free health clinic as part of the reasons to come on down, and some of their Followers of the Apocalypse followers are just always active in NC, working to set up traveling health clinics (along with the support of dolls that the NC clone creates out of corrupt government officials to overcome red tape) and doing important philanthropic work all over the state. Over time LTJ integrates many different things into their carnival, adding some of their machines from jumps like Generic Restaurant to them, as well as adding the Essence Store and one of their bars to the carnival, making it altogether more useful (and transforming the wandering carnival into even more of a base).¬†

Nothing about this jump is wild or especially difficult for LTJ to overcome. As LTJ travels they spend their days looking for amusing people to grant wishes for, using a range of their perks from Love List Cupid to their charisma perks, to see who has what needs and to offer them to such people. One of their favorite things to do is to find sick millionaires or billionaires and mesh their charisma with the patent nostrum and magical contract items to get them to pay heavy prices for the medicine. This empowers LTJ thanks to the *Power of Money* perk from Wario World. LTJ will also offer people much cheaper access to the Doctor‚Äôs Bag, at least if they decide the people deserve it, offering children or poor adults very cheap deals in exchange for bringing their loved ones back, but informing them that the person will not be FULLY back (and will be out of sorts for a while). They keep the fact that their mere presence is a bit of a social balm a secret, with *A Helpful Hand* being active and thus subtly making things better for people even if they just casually chat with the Master of Ceremonies and opt to refuse a deal (which LTJ passively accepts, wishing them well). *Ring A Ding Ding* also has a chance to prove its worth, making the carnival run much more smoothly and become more profitable. After a bit LTJ also begins to experiment with *Jumper*, working on transporting more and more stuff at once. Some years pass and the jump comes to an end, allowing LTJ and their eerie carnival to move on.¬†

**Perk & Item Notes & Synergies**

This jump has some secret cracked perks and items. I‚Äôll start off by mentioning my favorite in the ‚ÄúSecretly cracked‚Äù category; Dangerous Outline. This goofy perk makes you immune to getting hit by a projectile smaller than yourself, which is unbelievably strong. It‚Äôs worth coming to this jump for this perk if nothing else, as this perk means that most (though NOT ALL) projectiles won‚Äôt do shit to you. There are ways around this, with explosives being good at rendering this useless, and people can just use huge projectiles against you (like a big ass boulder), but when this is useful it‚Äôs REALLY useful. We were just in Fallout and in Fallout this is almost as incredibly useful as the *Demolition‚Äôs Expert* perk can be. This is also ridiculously useful in, say, Elder Scrolls where it‚Äôd stop a lot of magic and many ranged weapons would suddenly become useless. Also, in the wicked little hands of LTJ this perk‚Äôs real usefulness can become even more apparent since LTJ can freely turn into a platinum behemoth, or other large monsters like deathclaws. This also helps with thrown explosives, like our grenade satchel or projectile weapons like the atomic blaster. Unsurprisingly this is very synergistic with LTJ‚Äôs preferred fighting style which is that of a ranged rogue who also has *Sniper* (which makes each blow much stronger if you strike someone from a distance).

From here we can glance at the origin-ed perks. LTJ is very charismatic so they can easily benefit from *Somnambulism* (which they use to great effect during the jump, using it on various people to attain a number of different ends such as diverting law enforcement or helping people be honest with themselves. *All part of the Show* is something they use to show off their powers in front of audiences. *Emotivore* is fun, and they use it to replenish their stores of arcane power with surprising ease.¬†

The items here are a delight, with some being quite powerful. LTJ is especially happy to have Patent Nostrum, which is a snake-oil cure-all that actually works. LTJ uses theirs quite regularly, happily selling it to people and sometimes just using it purely benevolently. They are also thrilled to have the Magical Contract item which is worth its weight in gold and is quite nice for someone who delights in being a shady merchant. It‚Äôs also very powerful when used in conjunction with the trial essences from the essence meta CYOA jump. Doctor‚Äôs Bag is very nice, and while the simple way to use it is to gain undead laborers LTJ uses it to help families. The Cabinet is not especially useful, but I like to snag items in sets, and I know it can be handy in the right circumstances. LTJ‚Äôs particular carnival is also popular and is a nice little downtime item for LTJ to run since it will guarantee a healthy income and provide a nice cover for wandering adventures and downtime activity (in case it‚Äôs not obvious LTJ tends to wander and enjoys moving from place to place). It helps that the traveling carnival is also a fantastic pretext for activities that LTJ enjoys like wandering health and medicine things, as well as deal making.¬†¬†

Also I rule that all companions, be they Fallout companions or the clown or spider from here, function as followers unless specifically imported via paid CP. I don‚Äôt really like companions, but it makes sense that LTJ would naturally acquire followers over the course of their adventure.¬†

**Overall Build Notes**

At this point LTJ is a rather fascinating jumper. There is a HEAVY focus on things like charisma, magic, science and psychic abilities, with LTJ being especially nasty in social scenarios and in unorthodox battles. LTJ has the potential to fight and defeat a range of foes, especially since they have cloning powers, the ability to shred immortality and invulnerability, and a wicked slate of forms that they can use thanks to *Skull Absorption* and their Omnitrix alt-form (and among other things they can turn into a Mogo, a terrifying lifeform that can grant humans and humanoids telekinesis and mentally enslave them). Nonetheless, LTJ is probably outperformed by any mid-grade superhero or supervillain in terms of raw physical stats, even though this is someone who has the power to chuck cars at people, shapeshift, and teleport. In all honesty one of the most fucked up tricks LTJ has, other than just talking people into allying with them or stoking hatred against someone else, is their ability to just blow shit the fuck up, which is not very rogue-like but is a rather amusing trick. They are perfectly willing to summon their experimental MIRV and point it at the ground, and then actually fire the weapon (which would not only not harm them it‚Äôd deal damage for twice as much range as it should!). They also have a ghoulish ability to spontaneously irradiate the area around them at will, which they can opt to make helpful for allies.¬†

Some perks are incredible aces in the hole. *Inverse Ninja Law*, *Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint*, and now *Dangerous Outline* are part of a really sick package of powers LTJ has that make them incredibly dangerous. And sometimes individual perks synergize in horrifying ways, like *Sniper* and *Dangerous Outline* making it so that LTJ is an incredible sniper and assassin and makes it incredibly tough to snipe them back (though, again, they can be fucked up in other ways). *Explosives Expert* and *Demolitions Expert* is incredibly nasty, with it being one of LTJ‚Äôs favorite tactics when there‚Äôs a pack of enemies who just HAVE to die. A really wicked facet of it is a secret synergy that happens when you use the party system gamer system feature, which immunizes allies to friendly fire. Another really sick combo is *Jumper* and *Powers* which grant LTJ remarkable mobility by allowing them to fly and telekinetically fuck with their environment while warping from place to place. A fourth secret combo is the fusion of science perks from *Jumper* and *Generic 50s Sci-Fi* (and also the science reward perk from Old World Blues, which bolsters your learning speed by 5 times when it comes to science which is INCREDIBLE) which grant LTJ a breathtaking level of skill with science. We have acquired a healthy number of science perks, and we‚Äôre not done, but remembering just how strong our science stuff is feels good. Some random perks get used for fun all the time, like the Love List Cupid perk, or the Perfect 10 for anybody perk. Beyond that, some handy perks like Secrecy Insurance are passively protecting our jumper and just always handy speaking broadly.¬†

LTJ‚Äôs items have been steadily growing in number since the start of their chain. The addition of the carnival, coupled with items that can outright resurrect the dead (which is something wholly new that LTJ has just not had until now), is extremely neat. It also meshes well with stuff like their Fallout items, especially the Autodoc. I really like the idea of placing the‚Ä¶ super bars that LTJ owns in small towns in North Carolina, as these bars are just about as fully upgraded as they can be (only missing the superhero and their sidekicks). LTJ doesn‚Äôt have a warehouse but they do have the Mojave Wasteland, which they CAN import (they just don‚Äôt want to do that). Going further beyond our most used items tends to be robotic servants, generic magitech, and various QOL things like Supplier Contracts, the restaurants, things like food trucks and delivery drones."

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the time he returned to the market square, Zain was tired, hungry, and had a hell of a headache. But he had successfully arranged for a cart ride back and convinced the cart rider and another mage-for-hire of the benefits of physical labour. The benefits were mostly Zain pinching his wallet, and agreeing to pay them a gold drachma each for helping him with the hard part for the next day. He had also agreed to pay for the food and drinks naturally.

It was an expensive arrangement, and it hurt having to pull the coins out of his wallet, but it would be worth it if could get the work started as quickly as possible. Zain had already figured out that he was massively out of his depth on the walk back to the city, a little bit of help would make things go so much easier.

It wasn't long before Zain was heading back towards the farms. By his side was Asha, another hedge-mage. She had purchased some manner of physical magic that allowed her to boost her strength and endurance and was currently hawking her services in the city market to gather enough funds to apply to train for the city guard.

The cart driver was the same teenager he had met yesterday, and Alric, as he was named had apparently sunk all his money into buying a spell that gave him a monstrous amount of stamina. From all the chatter, he had figured out that Alric's dream was to one day own ""a herd of carts"" and retire early enough to enjoy his youth while he still had it. It was a simple wish, but respectable.

Physical ""mages"" like Alric and Asha hadn't yet completely replaced oxen, cattle and horse-driven labour but that was only because you didn't need to teach them magic, every beast simply learned a little throughout its life. Still, it looked to be going that way, mostly because using a beast of burden meant that you would have to have a human simply to oversee the work.

Still, *they must use oxen and horses in villages and towns near the city*, he thought. It was simply far easier for the city to have everyone in the town be *initiated* than it would be for a far-away village to do it.

*Initiation* was a simple ceremony, typically conducted as one turned thirteen, where an elder mage would guide a novice through their first act of magic - it needn't be anything great or spectacular, some simple sparks or gust of wind, anything would do. The importance of the *initiation* ceremony was that it allowed the empire to safely introduce its young people to magic. He had read once that before the empire discovered how to *initiate* people, fatalities were distressingly common when trying to awaken one's magic.

After the discovery of the standard method about a hundred and twenty years, the empire had rapidly undergone a period of expansions and military campaigns which led to a quick absorption of the city-states nearby. It certainly had led to a startling explosion in the population of the *initiated* among the citizens of the empire. With even the passive spark of magic lending an undeniable vitality, there were hardly any people in the bigger cities who were uninitiated. Still, this didn't mean that spells were a common thing as well - those were hoarded jealously by the various academies and clans around the city. A single new spell or a novel application could indeed be a family inheritance. Zain himself had paid a total of hundred and seventy golden drachma for his two spells, and he considered the cost entirely worth it. A few more months of work and he would be back in the black - and then it would just be smooth sailing and quick money.

His life was looking up.

All this woolgathering meant that enough time had passed that they had reached the city gates, and it would only be a little bit longer to the farms themselves. There wouldn't be much time before the sun set but he was determined to at least get through the de-weeding process.

There was a semblance of a plan in his mind - he would have Alric and Asha take a section of the farm each, their task being to pull up the weeds in the entire area and then distribute them somewhat evenly. Then, he would spread around his spell-slips in the field - having had the chance to stock up on them, in the market itself. Once it was all set up, he would trigger one of the slips and let the fields burn. He had bought a little bit of lamp oil to hasten the process along. As the fire spread, the three of them would move on the fields besides the one already burning, and make sure there was no break in the dry grass.

He only had to make sure that the area around the barn was wet enough that the fire did not spread towards it, but it wasn't a major concern, since he could keep up a constant wall of rain clouds for a considerable amount of time. It wouldn't be safe to sleep before the fire burnt through the entire farm but it would be far less work than having to pull out each weed up by its roots.

Zain found himself oddly eager, looking forward to the evening with anticipation. Even though the work would involve some hard labour, the blaze was going to be so pretty. Perhaps he'd even get enough practice that he would able to improve his *heat* spell enough to spark fires instantly, instead of having to go the slow route of gradually increasing the temperature enough to have most things spark to fire naturally.

""We'll be there soon, Zain. Just a couple more minutes. You better work fast if you want to get any use out of us today, haha. I won't hesitate to thank you for free money""

He shook his head as he patted his pockets, once more paying attention to the road. They soon passed by the lake shore and reached the farms. Zain had Alric secure his cart in the barn since it wouldn't be safe enough to leave it outside without keeping an eye on it. They all sat down on the floor, mostly to let the young man have a breather.

""We should start soon, but have something to eat first. Makes no sense to work on an empty stomach"" Zain said once Alric's breathing seemed to have calmed down. There was a light sheen of sweat on his brow, but aside from that he looked entirely unbothered, which was impressive for a man having ran six miles dragging a cart, two people and not a small amount of supplies.

Their meal was a simple affair eggs, onion and bread. The eggs and onions were crushed and spread out on a simple bun, which Zain toasted with a simple twist of his will. The air around his hands quickly warmed, and in only a bit of time, he had a pair of buns toasted for the three of them. They quickly tore into their meal, washing it down with some cold water, and then headed out to the farm.

It looked just as daunting as it did in the morning, the vast expanse lying barren and uncultivated. But now that Zain had a semblance of a plan, his task wasn't so hopeless. It took only a couple of minutes to direct Asha and Alric to their sections of the farm, where he told them to clear about a small block's worth of farmland. By his estimate in the morning, it would take about twenty spell-slips to burn through an entire field, and the entire farm was divided into a grid of thirty fields total.

While Alric and Aisha started pulling out and spreading the weeds around, Zain sat down and took out fresh paper and started preparing more spell-slips. He had only prepared about forty in the morning, and if he needed enough for the entire farm, that would be five hundred and sixty more slips.

The magic academies in the city were curious things, operating less like schools, and more like shops for magical artefacts, spells, warding formations and other knick-knacks. Once someone purchased a spell, they were assigned a tutor to make sure that they were *initiated* and that they wouldn't blow themselves or others up in the process of learning the spell. The entire 'course' was typically three weeks to a month, depending on how long you took to learn, and you ended up with 'certification' at the end. Zain wasn't sure the certifications were quite necessary to use the spell itself, but hardly anyone would hire a new mage if one did not have the necessary paperwork.

Zain had gotten the hang of basic applications of *heat* quite easily, the spell application being straightforward and quite obvious. It only took him a week. So, he ended up paying a little extra to learn how to apply the spell through warding arrays. That was how Zain earned most of his money, going around refreshing and repairing heat arrays and kitchen stoves around the city.

Farm work was an entirely different beast, and he had only taken the job because of how much it paid. Regardless, now it was his responsibility to finish it.

The spell-slips were something he had figured out on his own, being a derivation of the warding arrays. They were easier to make, requiring nothing but paper and magic, but quite a bit more unstable. He had noticed how the warding arrays drew on the natural mana around them, not pulling energy from his reserves to run, and had been inspired by the necessity to create something similar that would allow him to exceed his mana capacity if he for some reason required a lot of fire at once.

The only issue was that the spell slips were inherently unstable, simply being woven mana and paper, and they spontaneously burst into fire and ash in around a week. For the same reason, they could be triggered at will, or stuffed with more mana in an instant. This would result in a quick conflagration that would die out instantaneously unless it caught other stuff on fire.

The act of making a spell slip was simple, Zain would simply tear out small slips of paper, the size didn't matter much as long as it wasn't too small - and weave his mana through the fibres of the paper impressing upon it the flavour of heat and fire. He would only give each slip enough mana that magic wouldn't immediately dissipate, and then the paper would do its job, the fibres within causing the magic to stick around unable to dissipate but not having enough energy to burn the paper to ash. As he made one slip after another, the act slowly became meditative.

It was as if he was in a trance, he could feel the mana rushing from his lungs and down his arm before it was expelled from the centre of his palm, and caught by the tips of his fingers. He then slowly and methodically weaved it into the paper slips, making sure to give the spell-pattern only enough energy to stick to the paper fibres like gum to sticks.

It took him about two or three hours before Alric and Asha were back for a small break.

""We've gotten through about a quarter of the farm of weeds and spread the dry grass through all of it"", Asha told him. ""It shouldn't take much more than a little oil and spark to have the entire thing go up in flames.""

""Damn, you guys work way faster than I expected"". Poor planning had delayed Zain about four hours, so while it was close to noon when he had started walking back to the city, he reached the market near about an hour and forty minutes past noon. With it taking him half an hour to gather materials, and another forty minutes to find the two of them, he estimated it was nearly two-thirty in the evening before he left for the farms again.

He had expected Asha and Alric to be out pulling weeds till the damn sun set, but they were so much faster than his estimates.

""You fire-slinging morons always underestimate us physical types."" Asha flexed her biceps, the corded muscles in her arm going taut, reflecting a quiet strength. ""It might not look like it, but what we do is also magic"" she continued.

""I'm nowhere near strong enough for an adventurer party"", said Alric wistfully, ""but I never tire unless I run out of mana. Us pulling out some weeds was never the hard part, we could even do the rest of it, it'll only cost you slightly more time and coin""

Zain shook his head back and forth almost on instinct, a denial slipping out of his lips. ""I've spent so much time and energy planning this out, might as well test it out. I can always consider other options later.""

He wasn't going to consider other options, because he was going to burn the freaking weeds down to the roots if he could. It was almost a matter of pride at this point. He picked up the slips he had prepared and started distributing them, dividing them evenly between the three of them.

""Take these, and spread them evenly around the farm, about two meters apart from each other.""

""What are these?"" Asha asked.

""You'll find out soon enough, don't worry! It'll be a nice surprise""

Before he forgot, he also picked up the clay pots of oil he had bought and handed one each to both of them.

""While you place the spell-slips around, please also soak them and some of the grass around. Should make things a lot easier, I think""

""Are you sure this is safe? I don't fancy burning to death myself"" Alric said, but shook his head and walked alongside.

The two of them followed him outside, and it took only a little bit of time to prepare the arrangement. Once done, Zain directed the three of them towards the barn-house. There they prepared a clean fire-break from the surrounding farm, digging a miniature moat around the house itself.

Zain and Alric then stacked the earth in a small mound following the inner curve of the trench, before a small casting of *conjure rain* filled the trench with water. They also compacted and drenched the earth-and-grass dam in water. There was no way any fire was breaking past this barrier. A steady casting of *conjure rain* would continue to keep the ground wet, and they could safely rest here.

Then, it was time.

Zain walked out to the nearest slip, overloaded it with a bit of his own mana, and set it off. He could feel the rush in the air as the slip eagerly burst into a small inferno. It was as if the rush of magic and fire had set off a domino, with nearby slips catching on fire as well.

Zain could feel the heat on his face, his mouth splitting into a wide grin as the fire spread. He could sense the mana in the air rushing towards the slips, setting off the barely stable spell woven into each of them. There wasn't much time to safely admire it, however as the temperature spiked almost immediately.

He turned around and almost ran to the firebreak, feeling the heat on his back all the way out.

""Guess we are having no sleep tonight, yes?"" asked Asha as he jumped over the small mud ramp.

""You two can, but I will have to maintain the damn and water level. I can not, I think"" Zain said.

""We can sleep in shifts, and one of us will wake you when the water gets low""

The entire farm was lit up by flame, and It looked hauntingly beautiful. Zain felt like he could feel the wind on his back, air rushing towards it.

It was indeed the most beautiful thing he had seen. He could almost feel the current of the environmental mana, rushing down towards the unlit spell-slips and among itself, maintaining a steady fire as it rushed outwards, catching dry grass on fire. The fire almost seemed like a living creature as it swallowed more ground.

Eventually, he was forced to maintain an active casting of *conjure rain*, as the mud wall around had gotten visibly dry. While Asha and Alric took a well-deserved break and ate, he walked around the barn house, making sure not an inch of the firebreak was dry.

There was a little struggle, as the mana he expelled seemed as if it wanted to rush into the roaring wildfire they had set off, but with the ease of long practice he moulded it into the spell he wanted, and the air around them visibly darkened with humidity.

Slowly, water began to fall out in little drops, and he could smell the pleasing scent of wet earth.
