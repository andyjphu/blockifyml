Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 7 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $35

Enjoy 8437% Gains :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede And Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

When Newtons Wave reaches the intersection as shown on the chart, then it will turn.

The date and time at which it will reach the intersection, is dependent on human behavior.

The distance between peaks never changes, but the time it takes to travel to them can. This is based on the frequency of purchases and sales. (Like wind in the sails). The stronger the wind, the quicker the distance will be traveled.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

Top 100 highest % from ATH in the coingecko top 500 coins,CryptoCurrency,v5btca,2022-06-05 07:54:53,13,0.69,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v5btca/top_100_highest_from_ath_in_the_coingecko_top_500/,lexwolfe,METRICS,"as a follow up to this [recent post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v4c83w/top_100_sorted_by_from_all_time_high/), I present this table of the 100 highest percentage from all time high in the coingecko top 500. I got this information from the coingecko API which is super easy to use and doesn't require membership for basic queries [https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)

Age is an estimate from the oldest year of ath and atl. There's not an age field otherwise.MCR = Market cap rank

I wonder if there's a way to create a meaningful ""score"" from % from ath and days from ath.

\- dApps on Polygon charges around THIRTY % less with Gasless vs Polygonscan

 \- dApps on Ethereum saved over $183,000 or $6.80/transaction with Gasless vs. Etherscan  - In 2021, it was $154,000 making 2022 the year with highest amount of saved gas 

 While Gasless API allows the integrated dApps pay lower gas fee than the one without Biconomy, on behalf of their users,  users can interact at 0 cost. That's a win-win!  

\- At the time of tweeting, [$BICO](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BICO&src=cashtag_click)\-system has welcomed hundred of dApps who trust in Web3 mainstream adoption

KuCoin remains committed to discovering the next hidden gems in the crypto space and so we are actively adding new coins to our platform all the time. Previously, we posted all listing-related info in the Subreddit to keep everyone informed. However, some users feel that method is a bit spammy, so we are trying another way to deliver such info.

We will now start summarizing all listing-related info within the week into one post so that you can easily get the whole picture, as well as  find detailed information regarding each listing.

It’s that time again for our monthly recap and discussion post.

In case you missed it, we listed the following assets in February:

[Sand (SAND), Maker (MKR)](https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1489312863122604032?s=20), [Altair (AIR)](https://blog.kraken.com/post/12904/altair-air-trading-starts-february-8-deposit-now/), [TerraUSD (UST)](https://blog.kraken.com/post/12977/terrausd-ust-trading-starts-february-17-deposit-now/), [My Neighbor Alice (ALICE), Audius (AUDIO), Biconomy (BICO), Ethereum Naming Service (ENS), Gala Games (GALA), Immutable X (IMX), Keep3r (KP3R), Merit Circle (MC), Woo Network (WOO), Yield Guild Games (YGG)](https://blog.kraken.com/post/13040/trading-for-alice-audio-bico-ens-gala-imx-kp3r-mc-woo-ygg-starts-february-25-deposit-now/), and [pSTAKE (PSTAKE)](https://blog.kraken.com/post/13076/pstake-pstake-trading-starts-february-24-deposit-now/)!

Additionally, we listed [Songbird (SGB)](https://blog.kraken.com/post/12942/kraken-supports-the-songbird-sgb-airdrop-for-xrp-holders/) and released the airdrop to those who held XRP or a leveraged long XRP position at the time of the snapshot.

Equally as exciting, in an effort to lead the industry in transparency, we released the results of our [Proof of Reserves audit](https://blog.kraken.com/post/12774/verify-your-bitcoin-and-ether-balances-on-kraken-with-proof-of-reserves/). Now our clients are able to verify that their bitcoin and ether balances were held securely by Kraken at the time the audit took place. If you haven’t done so yet, we highly recommend you check it out!

Have something you'd like to share with the Kraken Support team? We're all ears. Feel free to thread your questions or comments below.

Warm thoughts and well wishes to you all. ♡

Here’s what you need to know about the assets:

**My Neighbor Alice (ALICE)** is a multiplayer game by Antler Interactive that aims to make blockchain tech more approachable for non-crypto players. Players can earn rewards and purchase, own and customize virtual land, all while interacting with other players.

**Audius (AUDIO)** is a blockchain-based music streaming platform built for artists to grow a larger fanbase, share works-in-progress as well as completed songs without having to rely on an intermediary record label.

**Biconomy (BICO)** aims to streamline crypto transaction flows by reducing gas fees and increasing the ease of transferring assets across protocols so as to make Web 3.0 more composable and interoperable for all.

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** is a distributed domain naming system for the Ethereum blockchain. It maps human-readable identifiers to machine-readable ones, such as Ethereum addresses and plaintext URLs.

**Gala Games (GALA)** is a blockchain games studio aiming to create ‘blockchain games you’ll actually want to play.’ It seeks to establish an ecosystem where players can take ownership over their in-game assets and achievements.

**Immutable X (IMX)** brands itself as the first Layer 2 NFT platform on Ethereum. It boasts zero gas fees, instant trades, and carbon-neutral NFT creation and trading.

**Keep3r (KP3R)** is a decentralized job board platform designed to connect projects needing development operation resources with those who can provide the required services, known as Keepers.

**Merit Circle (MC)** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on developing the play-to-earn (P2E) economy through the management and sponsorship of gamers, who in turn generate yield for the platform by earning in-game rewards.

**Woo Network (WOO)** is a liquidity network connecting traders, exchanges, institutions and DeFi platforms. The WOO token is used in the network’s CeFi and DeFi products for staking and fee discounts.

**Yield Guild Games (YGG)** is a play-to-earn gaming guild that brings players together and empowers them to earn rewards via blockchain-based economies. The project’s DAO allows users to leverage its NFTs for gaming and collects a portion of the revenue from users’ activities.

### 

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch – not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken’s listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken’s blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future. 

### Trade and invest with caution

Limit orders are recommended when trading starts since the markets may be illiquid initially. Be extremely careful with market orders and orders that trigger market orders (e.g. stop loss).

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."
