Problem with Star Citizen Vulkan,starcitizen,1i9qhkg,2025-01-25 11:20:28,5,0.77,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1i9qhkg/problem_with_star_citizen_vulkan/,No_Analyst1481,DISCUSSION,"o7 to everyone.  
I have a strange problem with Star Citizen and VULKAN.   
I have 5800X3D, 64 gb ram(2x32, 3600 mhz ADATA), RX6700 XT and 650w PSU, gigabyte ds3h b550m

I cannot use VULKAN on Star Citizen anymore. why? I have no idea.

ERROR 732823392  
I will try to explain here:  
For me VULKAN in SC is much stable than using DirectX11 (stutters a lot)  
The problem is if I want to use VULKAN in Star Citizen, it only works for the first time after i install my graphics driver. I Install Adrenaline -> start Star Citizen -> it does those shader caches(134k) and the game will run flawlessly.  
I can play even 12h without any problems. After I finish playing SC and I restart my computer, the next time SC won't wanna load with VULKAN. When it should load the menu it goes all black and the game closes the game and it shows me verify error. if I do the verify, it says it's perfectly fine.  
If I delete the shader cache from c:/user/local/starcitizen folder it's the same bullshit.  
I can use vulkan in Star Citizen only if I reinstall my graphics driver and it will work until i restart my pc.  
Did anyone have this problem?  
In c:/user/local/starcitizen folder I also check the game.log (to check for errors but I cannot understad)  
It's something like this in that game.log folder :

UNSEEN Shenmue Character and Area Renders!,Shenmue,1i9i6xr,2025-01-25 02:57:51,64,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shenmue/comments/1i9i6xr/unseen_shenmue_character_and_area_renders/,ShenmueDojo1,[Discussion],"Releasing at 8pm UK Time today we have a massive discovery to share with the Shenmue community!

Thanks to the efforts of not only Shenmue Dojo but also David De Ville, Chao Yu, and Nathan Gargus, we are proud to present over 100 newly discovered, unseen renders of characters and areas from Shenmue's development!

Following our recent purchase of the design artwork, active members of the Shenmue community set out to trace the original owner of these books and artworks. Their search led them to Hideki Kawabata, a former SEGA AM2 employee. While such rabbit holes often lead nowhere, this one uncovered a treasure trove of unseen images and artwork that had been hidden in plain sight for over 25 years.

We have preserved these on our website for the entire Shenmue Community to enjoy and we hope you take the time to marvel at a huge piece of Shenmue history!

With over 20 years of building experience, I would like to share with you my insights in navigating becoming a successful contractor.    With many different avenues of the building world its key to understand what problems will arise on any given day.  A man once told a saying that stuck-the 6 p’s in life- Piss Poor Preparation leads to Piss Poor Performance.  Preparation builds everything in construction, without preparation the jobsite will not run correctly.  The best advice I was ever given was to learn a little about every trade giving you the ability to understand trade lingo and secrets.   An example would be painters use the terminology flash; this means when the sub structure bleads through the paint.   Subcontractors will give the best pricing if they respect your knowledge of the industry.   If the subcontractor feels they will have to hold your hand through the job they will charge an extra fee…i.e. I call it the aggravation fee.  In this blog I will explain the key elements in finding success in all aspects of the industry.  Contracting is a physically and emotionally demanding job which requires planning and foresight to complete projects on time within budget.    Picking your customer is just as important as picking your employees or subcontractors.   I have worked for some of the most demanding customers leading me to question at the end if the job was even worth it.   Sleepless nights, constant changes, lack of payment, lawsuit threats, adding work that was in the contract are just a few things you could face with a tough customer.    With so many moving parts at all times it is critical to be able to adapt to changes within a short time frame.  Materials will come in damaged, subcontractors will be late, employees will get sick, but the deadline you set does not change. The stress can be overwhelming at times keeping your mind in a good place is key to navigating all that is thrown at you.  
Choosing your client picking the right jobs-Keep these questions in mind The first question to be asked is what the time frame is to start the job to see if it fits within the timeframe for your business.   If the time frame doesn’t work then move on from the project or let them know when you would be available to start.  If the client really wants to use, they will wait until you are available.   Taking on too much work will only lead to problems.  Construction is a serviced based business, staying on top of the project and client will eliminate an unhappy customer and construction issues that will be over seen.  With online presence if details are missed and customer service lacks it will only be a matter of time the phone will not ring. The second question to be asked to the client is do they have a budget in mind for the project.  If they answer yes this is good, follow through with what the budget is.  If the budget seems low let them know, this will eliminate a tire kicker, educate them on what the price range could be.  If the budget seems reasonable then continue the discussion to the next question.  If they answer no let them know that you can give them an estimate to see if the project is feasible with their finical capabilities.  Taking on a job that is not correctly budgeted will lead to an unsatisfied customer due to non-transparency of the construction cost. The third question to be asked is anyone else bidding on the job, if the answer is yes, understand you might just be number check for the contractor doing the job.  Dig a little deeper and find out how many numbers they are getting and why.  If your business model is to be competitive be completely transparent with customer, this will gain trust with them.   Let them know you get what you pay for and if you they choose the lowest bid it could lead into lack of quality of work.

The fourth question I will ask is there any specific subcontractors they wanted to use.  If the answer is yes then I would explain to them you only use the subcontractors you have a working relationship with.  Otherwise, this could backfire as the subcontractor might not show, do subpar work, talk behind your back to the homeowner.  In my experience I would stay away from using any homeowner to alleviate problems down the road.  A quick conversation now can save headaches down the road. The fifth question I will ask are planning on getting the job permitted, this needs to be known it takes more time for the permitting process.  Plans will have to drawn submitted and approved to the city before work can commence.  
The sixth question I will ask if a residential remodel is are you going to be living through the remodel if yes understand this will take more time to navigate the project due to answering questions and cleaning the house on a daily occurrence.   I would recommend seeing if the customer would be willing to move into an Airbnb or friends for at least the demo portion of the project.  If they do plan on living through the remodel add a couple hours a day to accommodate the extra time that will be required.  
The seventh question I would ask in a residential remodel is how old the house is to see if there is asbestos that would need to removed by a proper company.  A home built before 1979 will most likely have some asbestos in the house, use a licensed company with proper insurance to dispose of the materials. If everything looks good to this point find out a little more about the client personality.   If the client seems reasonable, I would bid the job.  Unreasonable people can cause you more stress than its worth.  These are some red flags I would look out for.  Some jobs are not worth the money. Very demanding in the way you are going to perform your job- I.e., tell you how you are going to do your job- You’re the professional not them! Give you a hard time about your price- haggle with price you estimated- The price is the price!  If they are a family with little money and you want to help them out is one thing, if they are trying to beat you down is another. Mention they have a lawyer-there is no need for them to bring up that they have a lawyer -  Run for the hills as if the job goes south, you will be the one losing out! Tell you what the payment terms are.  It’s your business you get paid how it works for your company.  If you want to get paid every Friday, put it into your contract-If the clients do not agree move on it will save you frustrations If they talk bad about the last contractor, chances are they will talk bad about you. There is a reason why the contractor does not work for them anymore, unless he did subpar work this a red flag Clients are using an interior decorator that will purchasing all of the materials- The materials could be ordered incorrectly by the interior designer your company will not make the mark-up it deserves.   Interior decorators usually add time to the job as well as act like your boss.  Charging a little extra for the time and stress that it will entail is only fair. Clients want to purchase the materials- You are using your knowledge to buy the correct materials-The mark up on the materials keeps the doors open working for wages only pays the bills The husband and wife do not get along-You will become the mediator between the couple it will lead to taking sides a losing proposition- A drama free work place is always best! Dangling carrot-if you do this job the next one will be better-Only look at what there offering at the present moment, if its not a good fit do not take the job for a job down the road…Its not worth chasing a job that might not happen! The Art of the Sale First things first selling your company is all about presentation.  In meeting your clients for the first time show up with a collared golf shirt tucked in, belt, nice jeans, and newer shoes.   Have a truck that a clean, no dents scratches, preferably washed the day you are going into your meeting.   Have a leather note pad that is clean no dirt or paint visible.    Show up 5 minutes early, if you’re running a little late shoot them a text to let them know.   Treat the situation as if were going on a first date, best foot forward.   As you introduce yourself give them a warm greeting, letting them know you are very interested in the work.   Find out a little about them, hobbies, where they lived, etc etc.  You are going to be working with them on a daily basis its nice to know what makes them tick.   Having a good working relationship from the start is key forming a solid relationship.   As the conversation progresses find out who wears the pants in the family…ie who’s the final decision maker.  If its fits the wife, chances it is…..then kindly let the husband know happy wife happy life when their in a stall mate on an issue.   As your looking at the project throw in some suggestions of what you think would look good from past experiences, this will get their attention that you have knowledge and want what’s best for them.   If you see ways to save them money in their project let them know, money is a large point of the sale keep that in mind.   Mention that you’re not the least expensive contractor but you’re not the most expensive either.  Your customer satisfaction is your number one goal which leads to more time spent on keeping them happy.   One happy customer will lead to another, one unsatisfied customer leads to work in the future.  Bring up the fact the finishing the job on time is key goal to your business, many contractors run several jobs at once causing the jobs to be finished way behind schedule.  You must stand out as having integrity, good morals, and the ability to problem solve to get the job.  The clients will be testing you to see if you’re a good fit as well.   Keep in mind as you take your notes that you must not forget anything they mention as it will come back before the job is completed…i.e. we mentioned that to you before we started the job!   Take pictures of the proposed area for work, that way you can use it to better right your estimate.   Let them know you will give them a detailed outline of when the job will be completed letting them see how long each phase will take and correlate it with your payment schedule.   Before you leave their house let them know when the estimate will be sent to them.  MAKE SURE YOU HIT THAT DEADLINE!   Once you sent the email over with estimate make sure you get confirmation that they received it.   Wait at least 2 days before checking with them, hopefully they contact you first!   If they want negotiate the price, let them know that it is the best price that you can manage, its not worth losing money before you start.  I closed 80% of the work I estimated by being very transparent and friendly.   If you come off with an attitude charge double what the going rates are you might only land 1 out of 10 jobs as well as getting the reputation of being expensive. Bidding the job Looking up industry standards on pricing is what I would go buy for pricing.   If you google the coat of any installation there will be a cost range for everything.  Looking at the cost ranging from high to low I would tend to be in the middle.  Some items might be low on the internet if this is the case use your best judgment not to lose money.   Closing sales is key to success and keep the doors open for business. Being in the middle on pricing is key as most customers shy away from contractors that are extremely low or high on the price range.   I tend not bid out hourly as wages do not pay for retirement.  Bidding is better as customers no the exact price of the cost of construction.  It also keeps the job moving quicker as time and material contractors take longer to complete projects…Thus costing the client more money and valuable time they could spend in their house. Using a Contract Using a detailed estimate tied to a contract covers your butt in 99% of the time.  Having a piece of mind that every aspect of the job is covered in the estimate and contract protects both your company and the client.  Key terms to include in your estimate/contract are. Have a schedule on excel showing the start dates and dates of each trade this will show the customer you are organized with time lines. If not written in the detailed in the estimate the item is excluded- This ensures if its not written down its not included. TBD- To be Determined- A phrase on a line item that has yet to had final decision of products or service needed. -The pricing will follow the decisions to be finalized Give out what your written warranty will be for parts and labor this changes state to state.  If the homeowner provides the product than no warranty will be given on that particular item. In the contract have a start date and end date with the verbiage subject to change due to weather, product delivery, change orders Have a progress payment schedule to ensure the client understands when funding will be expected-Including if not payment is rendered service to the project will stop.  
Have written terms of how change orders will be charged-cost plus 20% or a set fee Make sure in your contract that arbitration is required versus going to court- This will save lawyer fees and going to court Many contracts can be found online and each state requires different contracts

Finding leads Finding leads is easy with the right network of people.  I personally do not find working for friends or family members a good fit.  Relationships get strained when money is involved, causing undue stress for both parties.  I have listed a couple of ways to build a network or find work using the internet. Get in contact with realtor’s- Realtors have a big client base of homeowners who need work done  
Contact local Architects to see if they are working with any general contractors Leave some business cards at your local materials suppliers-Door/window/lumber-many times clients will ask salesman for a referral. Join a business networking group- BNI is one of many Join a internet website lead generation company- Houzz, Angie’s List, Home Advisor, thumbtack, Yelp run an ad on craigslist Use a marketing company to market your website-This could become costly with little results Create a Facebook business page Create a Yelp business page

Building your subcontractor base Having 2 subcontractors for every trade, gives you the flexibility of completing jobs on time if the one the subcontractors is too busy at the time you need their service.   Your subcontractors are the face of your business, choose owner run companies that are professional.  Check to make sure there license are up to date..ie workman’s comp, liability insurance, state license.   Choosing subcontractors with lettered vans, logoed t-shirts is s key to looking professional in the clients’ eyes.  In the past I have gotten a lot of subcontractors for material supply shops, stopping by jobsites, researching the internet using Yelp, Home Advisor, etc etc. Once you get one good subcontractor ask them if they know any other trades they would recommend.   One good subcontractor leads to another in most cases.  The key to having a good group of subcontractors is to let them know that you are there to get help them get the job done.  They do work for you but without them you are nothing…keep that in mind!  Make them aware a clean jobsite is required at the end of everyday to ensure the proper safety for all parties including theirs!  Over the years I have referred a lot of companies work when there is only 1 trade needed.     Referring work to subcontractors is a good way to get top priority when you have work that needs to be completed ASAP.   Timing is everything in times of emergency having a good group of subcontractors will make your business run smoothly.  Pay your subcontractors immediately after performing work, this will make them feel appreciated!  A happy subcontractor is one that will gladly go the extra mile for you knowing that there not just a number to your business!  Buying lunch once a week for the jobsite is always a good token of appreciation!

Supervising In supervising any jobsite its key to monitor everything from materials on hand, weather, vehicle parking (if applicable), jobsite safety, and subcontractors’ workmanship.  If you hired a professional there should be little supervision in the work being performed, on rare occasions a new hire might need some mentoring to get the results completed correctly.  If you see a problem with there work address it with the worker directly, no need to call his boss…. building repour with the worker letting him know you got his back goes miles down the road!  Checking in on the job first in the morning to answer any questions or changes that need to be conveyed and once in the afternoon to make sure all work be completed is done per construction industry standards.   A job that is run blindly will have many more issues than one that is watched over.    I have seen many jobs with no site supervision, leading to subpar quality work as well as safety hazards. Its better to be like an eagle than cluck like a turkey!

Working with the City/Inspectors On permitted jobs the city and site inspector will be a large part of how smoothly the job runs.   Each phase of construction has an inspection allowing for the project to continue.   Make sure your subcontractors are aware that the project is inspected before starting the job.  The best way to stay on his good side is to provide a clean jobsite and having the job built to the highest standards possible. When having the site inspected be courteous to the inspector asking any questions or concerns you have with the work during the job. Being completely transparent will save you aggravation of problems down the road.   The more he trust you the better if you seem sneaky or rude he will make your life a living nightmare!  Many inspectors will have an attitude towards you….I suggest keeping quiet and doing what ever he wants….he’s the boss no need to get in a pissing match you will not win at. How to deal with irate customer Stay calm during any argument with an irate customer.   Never raise your voice or show that you are bothered by their disgruntled behavior.  If the customer is trying to get more from you than agreed upon stand your ground.  Worst case scenario is you walk from the job, which in the long run be more of a loss for the client.  I have only run into a couple of these clients; they are unreasonable and not worth losing sleep over a few dollars.   Its best to terminate the relationship as it would be my best guess that a referral from this customer would not be one you wanted anyway.   If you feel it was just a miscommunication on your end, take reasonability and remedy the problem.   Taking accountability for your mistake will go a far way in their eyes and on future issues that arise. Prepping the homeowner pre-construction Before starting the job, it very important to give the homeowners a warning of what will happen during the construction process.

1. All furniture in the proposed working area must be moved- I would recommend having the clients take care of this to limit the risk of damage to their belongings.
2. There will be dust that will be in the house up to 3 months after construction-I would recommend hiring a construction cleaning company at the end of the job even so after it is cleaned dust will be present months after words.
3. There will be conflicts between you in the homeowner at some course of the job. - You will do your best to eliminate them as quickly as they arise-i.e. material damages, miscommunication, job delays
4. All decisions on materials must be made before the start of the job- this will eliminate job stoppage due to materials not being on site.
5. All materials will be on site before commencement of job-
6. Payment structures must be made per contract otherwise job will stop until payment rendered
7. Cars are to be moved out of the driveway- Ensures ease of loading and unloading of materials/tools
8. Give the specific hours that workers will be present- i.e. 7-3:30
9. Determine what areas are allowed to be used as staging for tools/materials
10. If animals are present in the home that they put outside or in a room during the day
11. All valuables in the house are locked in safe
12. Ask if using client’s household bathroom is okay or to bring in Porter Potty
13. Being transparent as possible is key to keeping a great relationship with your client!

During Construction During construction it is key to take detailed photos to eliminate any damages that were not caused by the construction process.  I would also make a video to ensure all areas are included.  All subcontractors should also take progress pictures to ensure if problems arise in the future, they will not be responsible for any work that they did not perform.   Keep an on-going log of progress to the homeowners and share the pictures for there records.   This will keep homeowners excited of the progress being made.   When the house is gutted to the studs it is important to have construction photos showing where all utilities are run in the walls or sub floor. If there is a problem in the future there will photos showing all utility locations. Protect all flooring with plywood or floor protective.  I also like to protect front door and tarp all areas where subcontractors are to be working.   Make sure to cover any chandeliers/furniture/doorways with plastic to eliminate dust.    Ask the homeowners if they have any concerns that they could think of.  We’re all human and possibly a detail was missed! Post Construction Phase If the project went smoothly appreciation should be shown to the customer.  Find out if the husband likes a particular type of liquor.  Bring the wife a bouquet of flowers.  Send a Christmas card to the family letting how much you appreciated the work.   You know you have done a good job if they tell you they will refer you to their friends.   The best compliment you could receive is a good referral.  
In Summary Try to find a knitch in the market, I found kitchens to be a great remodel projects.  Bathrooms are tough as they are small, expensive with little profit margin with every trade involved.  Windows/doors are also another great knitch as they can be installed quickly.   There are so many different remodeling items that can be stream lined to make the selling installing process flawless.  Once the core group subcontractors are in place the job almost runs itself.   Every day is a learning experience with new materials or methods in construction.   Keeping up with codes, materials, fluctuating labor and material cost is a job within itself.   Anyone can be a contractor with the right mindset."

Life is not as corlorfull as screens are,Healthygamergg,1i8l6g4,2025-01-23 21:34:52,15,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1i8l6g4/life_is_not_as_corlorfull_as_screens_are/,wegogymbrah,Mental Health/Support,"So I have been having an unhealthy lifestyle lately. I am using a lot of coping mechanisms to relief my stress of exams and other life stuff. I have ADHD and have developed a tendency of addiction.

I routinely abuse dopaminergic activity (substances as alcohol and weed while partying, smoking, prolonged and rapidly desensitized porn use, a resurfaced gaming addiction) As a result my dopamine tolerance has been built up by said habits rendering medication for ADHD ineffective (if I up the dose I get anxious). I cannot afford to do psychotherapy with my shrink, medication is cheaper (currently looking up ways to fix that). 

All of this came to me while looking at myself in the mirror. High, lethargic, PALE. I used to do stuff, talk to new people, my hobby was weightlifting, I had a passion for academics, drawing was fun. Going out didn't feel like a chore, accompanied by overwhelming guilt. A guilt of not achieving my parents ideal version of me. A guilt of not being good enough for me. Being defeated because there is always something more that you can do. To progress. To build a better you. You aren't good enough. Why would anyone like you. You don't even like yourself. 

That's what I think when I see the mirror. I have been dreaming for a perfect life. But my perception is skewed. My version of perfect is based around the fascade. The fascade we all carry. We don't look each other in the eyes. We look through a polarized filter of their mask. The social media ""tokenization"" of people has worsened this.

Or maybe it's only me that feels this way.

I do not have the color range of my screen, the bright colors, the exaggerated peoportions. The beautiful people making porn that I watch do. 

At least my exams are over. My thesis - dissertation is up next. "
Aren't current approaches to context (short term memory) surprisingly naive? Why not use a level-of-detail inspired hierarchical approach? (idea / discussion),LocalLLaMA,1i856eq,2025-01-23 09:57:19,6,0.8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i856eq/arent_current_approaches_to_context_short_term/,LagOps91,Discussion,"**Preface:**  
  
To preface all of this, I have a computer science background (computer graphics, low level languages and software architecture for the most part) and have a rough understanding about how current LLM architectures look like and work.  
  
Over the last couple of days, I have been quite bothered by how current approaches to short term memory and context operate. To me, it feels like short term memory should be a main concern of LLMs and be integrated into the architecture.

I have been thinking about this quite a bit and I feel I have maybe some interesting approach that I can share. The whole thing is inspired by some of my own work in the past about rendering complex 3d scenes with a fixed triangle budget.  
  
The idea was to start with a coarse representation of the scene and increase the detail of meshes within the scene depending on an estimation for how much a swap of the mesh would improve visual quality. Sometimes, swapping the mesh would even lead to worse quality, due to overdraw, z-fighting or aliasing issues.

  
  
**How does any of this relate to context you might ask?**  
**The idea is relatively straighforward:**

Currently, LLMs process a context, which consists of a vector of tokens, which themselves are represented by vectors. This can be compared to alway drawing a ground-truth mesh in computer graphics and it comes with about the same downsides: you only have a limited budget in terms of memory and compute, so you have a hard limit when it comes to context size.

You also have unwanted effects, such as the LLM starting to repeat certain phrases or having to deal with ""noise"" from parts of the context, which are not relevant to the current user input. This can again be compared to overdraw, z-fighting and especially aliasing issues.

What you actually want, is to represent the entire conversation history at different levels of detail (compression) and construct a context for the LLM to process, which represents the entire conversation history, but leaves less relevant parts at a lower level of detail, while preserving high/full level of detail for relvant parts of the conversation history.



**How could this be implemented?**

We start our level-of-detail approach by chunking the input-tokens into a fixed size (say, chunks of 16 tokens). level-of-detail 0 represents our ground truth, which is the tokens themselves - so we have 16 vectors, which can directly be obtained from the token embedding mappings.  
  
level-of-detail 1 can be obtained by compressing two adjacent level-of-detail 0 chunks of 16 token embeddings into a new chunk of 16 vectors representing the original 32 token embeddings. To obtain this vector, surrounding chunks can be taken into account via sparse/diagonal/linear attention employed by a machine learning model for embedding compression.

simillarly as to the construction of level-of-detail 1, further level-of-detail representations can be obtained until all chunks combined can (comfortably) fit into the context vector size of the LLM (let's say 8k embeddings / vectors). For the sake of the example, let's say that lod 5 is sufficient for the input being processed.

Now, we might have an lod representation that can fit into the context size comfortably, but it's all far too coarse to be useable for retrieving usefull information. What we must do now, is to decide for which chunks we want to swap the current representation (16 vectors) with two chunks of the next lower lod (2 times 16 vectors, 32 total).

To do so, we make a queue sorted by the relevance of the information encoded in the chunk in regards to the current prompt. For this, another machine learning model is trained and employed. In additon, a recency bias may be employed (new and relevant information is preferable to old and relevant information).  
  
Iteratively we take the chunk with the highest estimated relevance in respect to the prompt and replace it with two chunks, which we evaluate in terms of relevance and add to the queue.

The process stops once a maximum number of entires are in the queue. In our example, this would be 8k context / 16 vectors per chunk = 512 entries, minus the space reserved for the output of the LLM.

The chunks are then fed into a ""classical"" LLM, replacing the token embeddings and are processed with the usual attention mechanism.

  
**Typical use case and possible performance:**

For your usual work flow, you have the following:  
\- create LODs for all newly generated tokens/input prompt. This is linear in the amount of tokens processed and can be done while the LLM outputs new tokens. It feels to me like this should be next to free aside from memory requirements.  
\- when receiving a new prompt, re-calculate the the chunks for the new context based on relevance to the prompt. This is linear in respect to the context size of the LLM.  
\- feed the LLM with the new context and have it generate output tokens. This is quadratic in respect to the context size of the LLM (time and space)

  
**Conclusion/Discussion:**

As far as I understand, this method comes with the (imo quite big) advantage of providing a prompt-aware context construction, simillar to RAG, without inclusion of irrelevant details/""noise"" that might degrade the LLM output and while preserving knowledge of the entire past conversation. Other ideas of compressing context that I am aware of, create a short term memory store, which doesn't take the user prompt into account and might forget relevant details that the user is interested in / which are relevant to the query.

One significant downside I am seeing is that due to the context being re-assembled for every prompt, it's not possible to chache the context vector of the LLM and the whole context needs to be re-processed.

  
In terms of training, I'm not quite sure - the token embeddings already encode meaning, so it might be possible to just take an LLM and use it as a base. It would likely be good to jointly train the LLM, the chunk compression machine learning model and the relevance estimation model. This way it might be possible for the chunk compression model to encode extra information, such as the degree of compression, in a way the LLM understands and may use to further improve performance.



  
What do you guys think? Is this maybe a viable approach? What would you change/improve? Do you see any technical reasons as to why this can't be done? Is my understanding wrong? Feel free to correct me!

"So, I wrote a whole list of stuff that should be added to Arena Breakout/stuff that should be changed in Arena Breakout in my notebook. Currently, I have made 3 pages so I'm going to combine the 2nd and 3rd pages and write it down here on Reddit. Feel free to criticise! (Part 2 + 3)",ArenaBreakoutGlobal,1i84wwx,2025-01-23 09:44:56,3,0.71,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArenaBreakoutGlobal/comments/1i84wwx/so_i_wrote_a_whole_list_of_stuff_that_should_be/,HotZilchy,Suggestion,"1. Stamina should be decreased by a certain amount whenever you get shot in the chest, since the air in your lungs are knocked out.

  
2. Increase the ingame timer to around 50 minutes for normal maps and 70 minutes for larger maps like the Mine map.

  
3. The whole map should be alerted whenever an impostor spawns in, kinda like how a banner pops up whenever a microchip militant spawns.

  
4. Remove RNG from bullet penetration. A T6 bullet should have a 100% chance to pierce T6 armor at full durability, and a T0 bullet like the Dumdums should have a 0% chance to pierce T6 armor at full durability.

  
5. Add height over bore. It makes zero sense for my T951 to headshot an opponent when the barrel is blocked by a table but the sight isn't.

  
6. Increase the range and size of the training ground. Make it more open-fielded to practice sniping.

  
7. Weapons in the training ground should be able to be customised without having to purchase the said attachments for it. This should have been logical!

  
8. ALL armors and helmets should be added to the training ground. Also, I dont get why we have to purchase/get the armor first in order to unlock it. It's stupid.

  
9. Improve the lighting whenever the player looks into an unlighted building from outside.

  
10. Soundprints shouldn't be visible in Forbidden mode.

  
11. The damage dealt to your impostor character should technically be carried over to your operator character, since in the lore they both are technically the same person.

  
12. The AR Compact Tactical Grip should be compatible with way more weapons.

  
13. The AKS-74U's ergonomics should be buffed... Did I mention this in the previous post? I forgot.

  
14. Impostors should be BANNED from Lockdown and Forbidden mode.

  
15. All armors/helmets should also have penetration (protection) stats just like ammo that is based on the armor/helmet's material.

  
16. Render distance needs to be improved and increased.

  
17. Storage size needs to be increased. If this image is canon, we're supposed to have a whole ass Hideout for our storage, so... why not?

https://preview.redd.it/v48lg7y1sqee1.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&s=218b680cdf78c48f2191dd26d0093bb96c0e956a

  
18. Vehicle/vehicle trunks should be able to be used as extra storage during a raid, and when you extract with the vehicle the items are taken with you. The Mine map has so much loot so personally I think this is pretty reasonable.

  
19. Buff Derwin.

  
20. The M4A1 bots from Fred's squad should have T3 ammo, just like how the FAL bots have BPZ bullets.

  
21. Buff the fire rate for some weapons to make it more accurate to its real life counterpart.

  
22. Buff DMR's and bolt-action rifle's accuracy (Did I also cover this last post???)

  
23. We should be able to keep a bot's weapons/armors/rigs skins, for example Fred's Forest FAL skin should be available by obtaining his gun.

  
24. Canon clothing skins should be able to be bought with ingame currency, such as the Tevila and Colom skins.

  
25. Weapons shouldn't clip through walls and whenever it touches the wall, it should make a sound and produce a soundprint.

  
26. Impostors shouldn't spawn wherever there are other enemies nearby.

  
27. Nerf the pickup truck durability, especially for the windows.

  
28. Our bags should be able to be dropped when we press on the bag button for more than 2 seconds.

  
29. Add more armors/helmets, don't just focus on guns.

  
30. Add more actual avatar customisations (hair, skin, and facial types).

  
31. Weapons should be able to be switched between each hand.

  
32. We should be able to not hold anything for optimal running.

  
33. We should be able to extract if we're in the extraction zone even if the time has run out. I wonder if extractions in AB are even similar to real life.

  
34. If it hasn't been fixed yet, then PLEASE fix the RPD's reloading animation when its magazine is empty (For those who don't know, in Season 5 the reloading animation for the RPD when its magazine is empty is the exact same as the reloading animation for it when its magazine isn't empty, which it shouldn't be.).

  
35. Give Viper a boss token and consider him as a boss.

  
36. Decrease the time taken to unequip a thermal from your helmet, as I've already suggested a more impactful nerf for the T7 in the last post, so this should balance it out. Also, just something not as important, maybe add a refresh rate for all the thermals, just like in Tarkov? Idk.

  
37. Improve the optimisation in the Faction War modes. At the start of the match, all of the bots were ""iceskating"" for a lack of a better term while the enemy's gear weren't rendering in, which made it seem as if everybody was naked, which sucked obviously.

  
38. Non-driving players that are inside a car should be able to peek out of it to shoot more freely.

  
39. The player should get physically tossed back from any explosion.

  
40. Forbidden bots should magdump into the enemy on sight, in exhange for them having better gear (refer to my first post).

  
41. The boss token should show who exactly killed the boss to prevent loot goblins. Like PLEASE man.

  
42. Adrenaline boosters shouldn't affect jumping as much.

  
43. Sprinting acceleration should be more gradual and not instantaneous because of inertia, if you get what I mean.

  
Again, please share your thoughts down below. I will repost the first post, aka the prequel to this post after this is posted."

I’m thinking about the possibility of connect some rtx to some network. I founded rndr and io, io is market cap smaller and i didnt find answers in their docs and no so big comunity as render network. 

With render i found a comunity calcultor but i really dont understand somethings there.
I dont really now how this part works.

Logicly i want to know the profibility of this setor first, i can conect some graphics to the network if i can profit and in the mean time help render grow. 

To start my bussiness plan start for having a rtx4090 working 24/7 if possible. In my area the kW/h is ~0.17$.

This is what i have. Now i ask for your help.

I wanna set up shop.

Thankyou!"
Coinbase Solona Not Fixed. Render Token Shows Completed But Block Explorer Cannot Be Viewed,CoinBase,1i7iiab,2025-01-22 13:46:20,2,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1i7iiab/coinbase_solona_not_fixed_render_token_shows/,Exciting_Machine_896,,"Well. Because of all the hoopla going on, I decided to move my one Solana coin ""Render"" from coinbase to my broker, so as to escape what took place over the last 3 days, to my friends who owned Solana on Coinbase.

Here we goooo...

Render **send** Transaction says **complete** but broker requires a transaction ID to complete. 

So I go to hit the old trusty button on my Coinbase **block explorer**, under transactions, then token, which I have done 100s of times and its grayed out. It remains grayed out. 

Waited 2 hours and then went through the normal craziness we all go through on Coinbase. 

1) Phone support cut off ""hung up"" while I was in ""Q"" for an hour.

2) AI agents in HELP were no help. Promise's of human support with the generic message ""We will share an update with you in 30 minutes."" WHICH Simply repeats itself every 30 minutes...LOL

3) DM'ed Coinbase support on its official X (twitter) account.  Crickets!

That's my story so far. Anyone else? I mean since Brian Armstrong said they fixed the Solana / Coinbase problem?

Is sniping crypto profitable?,cryptoQandA,1i78hoj,2025-01-22 05:51:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1i78hoj/is_sniping_crypto_profitable/,Ujowo,,"## Understanding Crypto Sniping and Its Profitability

Crypto sniping refers to the practice of purchasing newly launched tokens immediately after they become available on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or liquidity pools, often within seconds or milliseconds of their listing. The goal is to acquire the token at its lowest possible price before demand surges, then sell it later at a higher price for profit. This strategy is heavily reliant on speed, automation, and insider knowledge of token launches.

### Mechanics of Crypto Sniping

1. **Token Launches and Liquidity Pools**:  
   New tokens are typically launched on DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap by adding liquidity to a trading pair (e.g., ETH/TokenX). Snipers monitor blockchain activity to detect these liquidity additions in real time.

2. **Automated Tools and Bots**:  
   Manual sniping is nearly impossible due to the speed required. Instead, traders use custom bots or platforms like *Maestro* or *Banana Gun* to execute buy orders the moment a token becomes tradable. These bots scan blockchain data, front-run transactions, and prioritize gas fees to ensure their transactions are processed first.

3. **Gas Fee Optimization**:  
   Sniping requires paying high gas fees to miners/validators to prioritize transactions. During periods of high network congestion, gas fees can spike, significantly impacting profitability.

---

### Factors Influencing Profitability

#### 1. **Token Quality and Hype**  
   - **Legitimate Projects**: Tokens with strong fundamentals, audits, and community backing may see sustained price appreciation, offering snipers a viable exit window.  
   - **Pump-and-Dump Schemes**: Many new tokens are scams or low-effort projects designed to rug-pull. Snipers risk buying into tokens that collapse minutes after launch.  

#### 2. **Market Conditions**  
   - **Bull Markets**: Sniping tends to be more profitable during bullish cycles, as investor enthusiasm drives rapid price spikes for new tokens.  
   - **Bear Markets**: New tokens often fail to gain traction, leading to immediate sell-offs and losses for snipers.  

#### 3. **Competition**  
   - The rise of institutional-grade sniping bots has crowded the space. Retail traders using basic tools often lose to entities with faster infrastructure or insider access to token launches.  

#### 4. **Transaction Speed and Slippage**  
   - Even a 1–2 second delay in buying can result in significant slippage, as early snipers dump tokens onto slower buyers. Slippage tolerance settings in bots must balance speed with acceptable price ranges.  

#### 5. **Regulatory and Security Risks**  
   - Sniped tokens may have hidden functions (e.g., blacklist clauses) that allow developers to block or confiscate holdings.  
   - Regulatory scrutiny of decentralized trading could lead to sudden restrictions, freezing assets or penalizing participants.  

---

### Risks and Challenges

- **Rug Pulls and Scams**:  
  Developers may remove liquidity immediately after launch, rendering the token worthless. Tools like *Token Sniffer* or *DexTools* can help identify red flags, but malicious contracts often evade detection.  

- **Front-Running**:  
  Advanced bots exploit Ethereum’s mempool to front-run snipe transactions, buying tokens before others and selling them at inflated prices to latecomers.  

- **Capital Loss**:  
  Failed snipes or rapid price collapses can lead to near-total loss of invested funds. Even “successful” snipes may yield minimal profits after accounting for gas fees and taxes.  

- **Ethical Concerns**:  
  Sniping exacerbates wealth inequality in crypto, as those with technical resources exploit retail investors. This undermines trust in decentralized ecosystems.  

---

### Strategies to Improve Success Rates

1. **Pre-Launch Research**:  
   Investigate the token’s team, contract code, and social channels. Avoid tokens with anonymous developers, unaudited contracts, or copied websites.  

2. **Bot Customization**:  
   Configure bots to avoid tokens with excessive holder limits, transfer taxes, or liquidity locks. Use private RPC nodes to reduce latency.  

3. **Portfolio Diversification**:  
   Allocate only a small percentage of capital to sniping. Spread risk across multiple launches to mitigate the impact of individual failures.  

4. **Exit Planning**:  
   Set predefined profit targets (e.g., 2–5x) and stop-loss thresholds. Avoid greed-driven holding, as most snipe gains occur within minutes.  

5. **Layer 2 and Alternative Chains**:  
   Explore sniping opportunities on L2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum) or newer chains (e.g., Base), where competition and fees are lower.  

---

### Real-World Profitability Analysis

Sniping is profitable for a small subset of participants:  
- **Top 1% of Sniper Bots**: Entities with colocated servers, custom algorithms, and insider launch calendars consistently profit.  
- **Retail Traders**: Most lose money due to slower execution, poor token selection, or inability to compete with institutional tools.  

Data from platforms like *DexTools* suggests that **~70% of new tokens decline in value within 24 hours of launch**, while **~20% generate short-term gains**. Only **~10% sustain growth beyond a week**, often tied to legitimate projects.  

---

### Final Considerations

Crypto sniping is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that resembles gambling more than investing. While technical proficiency and infrastructure can tilt odds slightly in a trader’s favor, profitability is unsustainable for most participants. Success requires continuous adaptation to evolving market dynamics, bot competition, and scam tactics. Long-term crypto wealth is more reliably built through fundamental analysis and holding vetted assets, rather than speculative sniping."

Rumored games: how to fit huge games in a cartridge?,NintendoSwitch2,1i6ci9h,2025-01-21 01:29:13,4,0.83,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i6ci9h/rumored_games_how_to_fit_huge_games_in_a_cartridge/,jonathanalis,Discussion,"https://preview.redd.it/ffkwcjf4haee1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=9be74f470cdf06130555ea0f339c5914fa2ce62b

Well, many third party games are set to be released on the switch 2. Im not here to discuss about them.  
It is a context to the fact that eventually it will receive very very big games in storage spaces. We might expect that games that ocupy more than 100gb on other plataforms to be released on switch 2.  
  
But how? They have be able to fit 32gb cartridges? or even 16gb if they want to get a cheaper cartridge to sell? \*  

\*16gb cartridge for switch 1 was the cheapest, so devs choose it. Latter, Nintendo allow 32gb, but they were more expensive, so devs still use 16, even for higher game sizes, and splitthe part you have to download.

So, I thiking there are two solutions:   
1 - go full on redution of quality of assets and compression, and be able to fit. Games will be based on a very low settings.

2 - They will choose the cheapest cartrigdges and they will be just a token for download the game digitally. And the games would occupy a large chunk of the 256gb storage. We would strugle to trade SD cards to get all games.

My hopes for solving:  
 \- I hope DLSS not only bring only general upsampling models, but they to be used in such was it enhance the rendered low quality assets, finetuning on high quality high res renders from the game engine.  
Then, we will have high quality visuals, but instead of stored on the game cartrigdes, in the weights of the DLSS models.  
  
 \- I hope they offer better options of cartridges, with 32, 64 not expensively, to let devs use them and let the full game fit them, and also better compression methods. (like they already doing in xenoblade chronicles X even in switch 1)

I specifically pick 4o as model yet the stupid thing always opens a Canvas.

How can I prevent this? Like, I just want to chat casually about a topic I like and the thing opens Canvas which renders the conversation useless and wastes a token.

Nothing works, man. I pay 20€ a month and can't use it how I want, I literally have to pray that this time it won't open this useless Canvas garbage 😒"
"I 22/F moved in with my boyfriend of 9 years (we are middle school sweethearts)  24/M  about 6 months ago to Missouri, & we broke up. ",relationship_advice,1i5jrz2,2025-01-20 01:11:10,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i5jrz2/i_22f_moved_in_with_my_boyfriend_of_9_years_we/,quartzdoll_,,"I 22/F moved in with my boyfriend of 9 years (we are middle school sweethearts)  24/M  about 6 months ago to Missouri, he has family here and felt he would thrive if we left Florida. 

He was persuading me for months. I was drinking a lot back home and i was generally unhappy, but on the other end of the token my life was pretty set up. I had good friends, a job & consistent income, and i was just messing around doing what 22 yr olds do. I’m from South Florida, a big city, wasn’t financially comfortable by any means, & living in a 1 bedroom apartment with 2 other people. It was rough but we got by. 

I questioned this move to Missouri a lot before I decided to say “fuck it, this might work out for me.” I visited his town prior to coming here so I knew what to expect somewhat. It’s tiny. REALLY tiny, country bumpkin middle-of-nowhere retirement area tiny. Thought i needed a refresher from big city club areas. I do really like it, & i love & thrive in the change of seasons. However i have been unable to score a job for 6 months. Everyone is pretty mean & closed off, no one is my age, & it has been virtually impossible for me to get hired anywhere despite my tireless efforts, 6 months of being cooped up in this house. I held out hope, but to no avail. 

Until a week ago, Dollar General hired me and has yet to put me on schedule. Was betting on that. 

I’d like to mention my boyfriend has a history of watching a lot of porn & talking to girls. I am loyal to a fault, & this broke my heart upon discovering this for the first time years prior. He was on and off about it, a constant cycle of over-explaining, talking, setting boundaries, phone open/close policies, it was rendered useless. I moved because he promised he changed. I went through his phone the first month I was here and I was proven wrong again. I stayed. This could be a whole entire post in and of itself, but I’m trying to keep it brief. 

Well tonight it all reared its ugly head. He’s been buying onlyfans since he got a job, $50 here, $5 there, for about 3 months. I have decided I can’t do this and I’ve made a serious mistake. We are trauma bonded and love blind, and we just wanted to grow and change together to put the past behind us. Nasty words were said & there’s no fixing it. I NEED to move back to Florida but i don’t want to go back to my living situation, (it will be my only choice) i have no money to my name and nothing saved up since being here(which was kind of the point in case i needed to up and go, yet here we are) We were saving for an apartment. He has ruined all of our plans. He gets to thrive and live the single life of his dreams & I will suffer. 

I don’t need you to tell me this was a stupid decision. I knew better.

I DO need serious advice, though, & I need someone to get through to me. I have no plan & no prospects. I have some serious thinking & blueprinting to do, so I can leave.
Do i stay, try to start working, & save up? Do I leave immediately with help & money from my family? Do I go back to my past self, same old habits & routine? I am completely lost & heartbroken. I centered my life around this kid. He was everything to me.  Be hard on me. "
Eleven seventy-one. Fifteen oh-seven. ,twinpeaks,1i5f78j,2025-01-19 20:50:06,22,0.9,5,https://i.redd.it/lu25ljt912ee1.jpeg,TheBr0fessor,,"I know we’re all still mourning, and as part of that process I’ve been re-re-rewatching The Return

There are two things about this image that I found yrev interesting.  

1) The number the dispatcher calls out. Somewhat innocuous, so I decided to google. Now, this isn’t anything groundbreaking but there is a patent https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/11711507?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIxMGZjYjdkMi0wM2RjLTQ5MWItOGZjOS00MDBhZmUxYjA0YTYiLCJ2ZXIiOiI0YzM4MWVlMS1iMDJhLTQ5MjgtODEyNS1jZDllMjEzNTNjNmYiLCJleHAiOjB9 (I would have linked to it, but I can’t add a link and a pic via the app) that was filed in 2012 for some kind of electronic device that can render stereoscopic images. That’s an interesting Easter egg for a man that devoted most of his life to photography. Also kind of interesting that it’s a specific type of photography that relies on two separate images viewed simultaneously to create the illusion of depth. The “technology” has been around since the Victorian era and one of its most famous applications was a stereoscope of the pyramids in Egypt. Which, look like Twin Peaks when viewed individually. 

2) The image on her screen REALLY looks like the surveillance footage of Cooper and Jefferies in the Philadelphia FBI office in FWWM. I don’t think it’s a direct match (at least from the stills I was able to google without doing a rewatch, but it’s very similar. 

I’ve spent lots of time on this sub and I don’t recall anyone mentioning these before. If it’s a known thing, well… great minds obviously think alike  😉


Thanks for your time, fellow detectives. "

this works fine and I can drag and drop and update the order number and display the updated number of the items in the card.

but when I change it to modal, it doesn't work and doesn't update. Can anyone help?

“In the labyrinthine tapestry of digital finance, meme coins emerge as a paradoxical amalgamation of esoteric whimsy and speculative fervor, encapsulating the zeitgeist of decentralized audacity. These quasi-currencies, replete with ostentatiously satirical nomenclature and an enigmatic propensity for virality, oscillate between the realms of absurdity and opportunistic gravitas. Ostensibly devoid of intrinsic utility, their valuation trajectory is inextricably tethered to ephemeral social media zeitgeists, hyperbolic valorization, and the mercurial caprices of internet subcultures. Consequently, the memetic proliferation of such cryptographic tokens engenders an eco-systemic dialectic that conflates anarchic democratization with capricious fiscal entropy, rendering their existence simultaneously ludicrous and profound.”

How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb: or an idea for a hypothetical age 4 DLC,civ,1i4frv3,2025-01-18 14:51:43,10,0.68,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i4frv3/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_the_bomb/,theultmitecatlord,VII - Discussion,"# I do dream of a nuclear winter

Initially when I heard that the modern age ended in 1950ish I was quite upset because the cold war is my favourite historical period, and even something as token as a ""Iron Curtain"" policy was enough for me to appreciate. But then when I heard speculation about a 4th age I realised the potential for really experimenting with implementing the dynamics of the cold war in a civ game and so here is my attempt at realising a pitch for such a vision

# Ideological Blocs

Similar to civ 5 we have three main blocks, capitalism, communism, and fascism, dissimilar to civ 5 is that instead of providing merely a few stats boost and a more appreciative UN, you win with your bloc collectively, the victory conditions I'll explain after clarifying he role of the players, the Superpowers and Minor Powers. These blocs however do have a few attribute to their own, the first in Bloc power, this is the main goal of the game and can be interacted with methods later, but more importantly is Ideological Cohesion, this determines how stable a Bloc is, and so say at the beginning of the age every country is fascist all of their cities would be trying to revolt and their stability would plummet, and so long as your Bloc is strained you cannot win the game, this helps to smooth over any issues with modern era ending under a communist world order and thus stopping the core point, for the ones enforcing said order we move onto the

# Superpowers

Determined by the player with the most scored (or maybe some other metric) within an Ideological Bloc, these three players are the principle actors in both the defeat and triumphs of a given Ideological Bloc, they control nuclear arms and have an outsized influence in both diplomacy and espionage, at the detriment of being the most appealing target and being unable to directly attack other Superpowers, having to engage in Proxy Wars (elaborated on later) to utilise you bloated military after that whole second global kerfuffle, Superpowers cannot ever change ideology without either being demoted to a minor power or performing so poorly as their Ideological Bloc ceases to exist (perhaps when a Blocs cumulative score reaches 10% of the other two/one combined)

# Minor Powers

Despite what you may expect they are not merely sock puppets mimed by the Superpowers in some macabre display of power, instead these collectively serve as kingmakers, as their goal is to pick the winning Bloc without rendering themselves so weak as to get consumed by another minor power. They are usually the prime places for counter espionage and Nuclear Stationing due to being between the Superpowers, and can leverage this to exploit said Superpowers into giving them concessions.

# Ideology and Espionage

It was neither true historically nor would be fun to compete ideologically just to have your most valuable pawn swap sides because they just felt like it, so what if instead we repurposed the religion mechanic and turned it into a base for a more active espionage mechanic? The fist and foremost use of this would be to convert civs ideologically, spies can only be seen by other espionage units and cost influence to maintain, to make the strategic placement of spies far more relevant whilst still allowing for countries with more success and thus influence to literally have a more direct influence on the globe. converting over half of a civs city would let you start aa civil war, where an ai empire spawn of the new ideology and takes all of the converted cities, the Player who got subverted choses who to support and thus play as and then it evolves into a proxy war, where using influence you can send aid in the form of donating weapons or even involving other minor powers, the more one Bloc intervenes the cheaper it is for other Blocs for to intervene, hopefully providing incentive for limited but still somewhat involved wars between blocs, this proxy war system would apply to every war that you aren't directly a part of. over 80% you can do a coup de ta and simply immediately convert an Empires Ideology at the cost of some population and devastated tiles. The spies themselves are as mentioned can be either invisible, anonymous or revealed, if a foreign country doesn't sign an espionage pact all of their spies will be hidden, and can act against any player with no repercussion, discovering where spies are and belong do can be done by either other spies, maybe some improvements and orbital infrastructure, and you can share your intel with other players for influence bonuses and of course to help secure your ideology.

# Victory

While you probably could continue the cultural, economic, militaristic and scientific victory scheme of the old system I think a more radical departure would better fit.

My primary idea is to only have the victory condition of possessing the majority of Bloc Score compared to all three Blocs, and there are four main methods to achieving this, of course just having these four methods being themselves a victory condition also works and I'll include how'd they work standalone.

# N#1 - Diplomacy

Being the age for it it seems time to actually introduce the UN, I think one of the largest issues with the UN in prior iteration of the civilisation franchise is t hat unless you're playing multiplayer it doesn't really feel like negation, as you just spend either diplo favour of envoys and hope that the global community doesn't happen to vehemently oppose everything you support, by using the ideological Blocs as voting Blocs and thus simplifying the equation it becomes drastically easier to understand why a vote went a certain way, to the degree that perhaps having superpowers decide unilaterally what their Bloc votes for may be the best option, in regards to resolution this would have a tired system, where at an influence cost and restricting what individual Empires can do you can empower the UN, upgrading it from allowing you to at most sanction some Empire to being the arbiter of who is allowed to join wars (i.e. allowing ww3) or the degree of military build up possible, with the standalone victory condition being forming a UN led world government with the primary support of your Bloc, while as a supplemental focusing on the UN lets you cripple other empires economy and happiness, and the lower the happiness of a city and Bloc the more attracted they are to new ideologies. Spies could also visit capitals cities or independent powers to harm or bolster this Bloc Score for UN purposes (or maybe just make it civ 5 diplomats idk)

# N#2 Science

This is the time for the space age after all and while as its standalone win condition is fairly obvious (do some expensive projects to into space) having space represented in some manner could be interesting, so the first satellite would let you see the entire planet, perhaps like how humankind allowed you to permanently see everything, you could have espionage satellites that let you search for enemy spies in a 3 tile radius every other turn, thus allowing you to prevent them from sabotaging rocket launches (I don't think individual districts would be worth sabotaging ala civ 6) or stealing your technologies. Having these bonuses is of course very useful and so would provide room for anti satellite rockets, who destroy enemy satellites at the cost of time and making all further satellites more expensive, the ultimate satellite for a non-scientific victory would be an orbital nuclear launch platform, why? well because of

# N#3 Nuclear War

I think the most unique way to win as it's the only one I think should always be standalone, Simply it involves developing nuclear capabilities to increase a hidden Nuclear Readiness value, the goal is to have 60% of the global nuclear readiness value an press the Big Red Button, if you are correct and indeed to have enough your bloc immediately wins as it has first strike capability, and wipes out foreign nuclear arsenals and soon armies, if you are wrong your military rebels against your order and the ensuing chaos and strive severely handicaps both you and your Bloc, because of the potential for superpower negligence perhaps requiring a unanimous vote among the Bloc to prevent frustration from losing because the USA launched its one nuke against the USSR's 200. You gain Nuclear Readiness by stationing nuclear weapons in either planes, submarines, missile silos and orbital platforms, in roughly that order of score, with more advanced weapons further increasing Nuclear Readiness, of course you can also use these nuclear arms if you make the UN say you can, you cant use the button if you are at war with either superpower (bit late for a first strike after all). The closer bombs are stationed to hostile blocs the more points, but at the risk that if a spy visits where a bomb is stationed it could be sabotaged, not contributing any points and doing nothing if tried to be used in an actual war would do nothing, of course the more nuclear sites your spies uncover the more of the enemies Nuclear Readiness you are aware of, allowing you to make more informed choices, overall being a sword of Damocles to fret about rather then the main way to win.

the fourth win path was already mentioned, as diplomacy mixed both the ""Expand your Bloc to rule the world"" and ""Game to UN to start a one world government), and I'm not rewriting those segments to segregate it, but I do think I've outlined four win conditions.

# Civilisations

not really my focus but for completeness sake

USA (Hegemon) - Largely a focus on currency and happiness, perhaps unique building /quarter for space and industry referencing winning the space race, associated wonder being the UN headquarter

USSR - Focus on industry and food, synergising with having a lot of high pop settlements, unique quarter focusing on influence ala KGB, wonder could perhaps be palace of the soviets but considering it was never built I seriously doubt it.

EU - Focus on Science and culture, costing more money to reach it, special district could perhaps make interacting with independent powers better ala the EU effect on more minor European countries. Wonder could be ""federation headquarters"", being the irl EU headquarters

Figure out the rest because I ran out of ideas.

# Leaders

Naturally the focus is on the age and mechanics so I don't have too many recommendations, if you wish to go for a cold war connected character I thin a good choice would be Karl Marx, civ 7 allowing non leader leaders to rule means he's actually included, his bonuses would naturally synergise with the USSR but could also provide an influential edge representing how successful his ideologies were in inspiring revolution in the latter half for the 19th century and most of the 20th century.

For the USA Martin Luther king would definitely be a good representative, as cold war American presidents were all VERY controversial, and considering hoe influential the civil rights movement was he's definitely significant. If I had to think of a bonus I think it would provide bonuses to captured settlement to represent a more equal society?

For a more out of the box option for the third Bloc of the game, Argentina's Peron, having collaborated with both the Third Reich and Soviet Union, within Argentina he followed a despotic approach to power with a generally progressive slate of policy, while he would definitely be the controversial (indeed I've mainly put him in because I wanted a fascist bloc leader that wasn't truly irredeemable in all respects, and franco was too much in the death camp territory for a non-axis member to my liking) his inclusion would be interesting, especially as he more sough to distance himself form any of either Axis, Allied or ComIntern ideology.

Gandhi would also technically fit, but I am under zero delusion that you'd wait this long to add him.

Nelson Mandela might work instead of MLK because there are way to many USA leaders, plus he's really cool.

# [NEW] Design Decisions

If the poorly worded subheading didn't give it away I'd like to explain why I think this works in a more abstract sense, the first reason of the why did I chose the cold war also goes to the fundamental of after the cold war I can only see either age 3 but again or some kind of space based colonisation which I think would just be exploration but instead of sea is space and new continents being new worlds, and I think that would just increase micro and confusion for relatively no benefit, so the cold war at least offers a unique framework to design around

For the actual mechanics the main goal I wanted if for both Minor Powers to be able to switch sides and also stick to one side to ""build something you believe in"" and make them the winning side, harsh enough that loyalty isn't punished but not so much that it only pure desperation. This is the core idea behind why I balanced the various features a certain way, so they're like two different paths for Minor Power victory.

# Miscellaneous

the three blocs should have flavour quotes in their individual sections

Fascist - ""Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."", the final line of the poem of the same name, read in a vacum ""it is good and noble to die for ones country"" is the exact kind of nationalistic sentiment that forms the backbone of fascistic ideology, yet the quotes source already centralises on them theme of this being a mere lie to convince those to tolerate it, just as how fachists use their nationalist rhetoric to paper over their horrific ideology, alongside the faux traditionalism provided by the latin paralleling their rhetoric, this quote is the one i like the most of the three

Capitalist/Democratic - ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" being the oldest of the ideologies  with its history dating back to the French revolution, alongside how despite communisms claims the western world was the most free and equal, and so I think it's a good quote.

Communist - ""Workers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!"" it just seems fitting.

Dulce er decorum EST pro patria mori, liberty equality fraternity, workers of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chains

Mockup of ideology screen

V Due to low score Fascist Bloc will be destoryed next turn and Brazil can chose who's bloc to join.

|Fascist Bloc|Democratic Bloc|Communist Bloc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bloc score: 260|Bloc score: 550|Bloc score: 700|
|Ideological cohesion: +30 (:|Ideological cohesion: +10 (:|Ideological cohesion: -10 ):<|
|Nuclear Readiness: 12 + ??|Nuclear Readiness: 76 + ??|Nuclear Readiness: 127|
|Superpower: Brazil|Superpower: USSR|Superpower: EU|
||USA (Hegemon)|China|
|||Congo|
|||Indian Republic|

I think it would be neat if the country names changed based on the Bloc (e.g CCP vs ROC vs Unitary State of the East)

Perhaps just as there are ideological civics trees in the modern ages the could be one collaborative tree for each bloc, that the entire bloc has to pool together culture to get these big bonuses

  
\[NEW\] nuclear warheads should work like great works, you have missile silos, nuclear submarines, metal gears etc. that each have nuclear warhead slots, reloaded automaticly if used of course but it takes 5 turns to do so, a nuclear weapon can only be replaced one inserted into a slot so replacing bombs to mitigate the risk of spies sabotaging them at the cost of production works, also allowing for teirs of nuclear bombs

TL:DR I hope the fourth age really leverages the cold war and radically changes the civ 7 gameplay, due to the first three ages already being expressly designed as a self contained experience.

PS - I tried to capitalise every new term like Bloc, sorry if I missed any it turns out the enthusiasm you get from having this whole system revealed to you in a dream doesn't extend to proofreading it weeks later."

What do you think about Stalker 2 not having Denuvo?,stalker,1i40svz,2025-01-18 00:40:33,3,0.53,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1i40svz/what_do_you_think_about_stalker_2_not_having/,min3r95,Discussion,"I'm happy, I don't have to deal with the forced online authorization nonsense.

I don't have to deal or see Denuvo defenders doing their things.

I bought the game fyi.



If anyone want to know what exactly is Denuvo and what it does:

Denuvo implemented games rely on 3rd party DRM server to generate authorization tokens in order for the games to be launchable(forced online authorization). 

These tokens are expirable and can be break under circumstances(reinstalling/update OS/driver,switching Proton(Linux), changing hardware) render the games useless.

The tokens won't be automatically acquired by themselves, you need to launch the games in online mode for them to be acquired.

The tokens can only be acquired for a limited number of times(usually 5)per 24 hours, once you reach the limit for whatever reason, you will be blocked out of your games, and will need to wait until the next day to be able to ""activate"" the game again.

You need to ask for permission to play the game you paid for.

You can play Denuvo implemented games in offline mode, but it won't be indefinitely.

In fact you can't play the games at all if there's no token or for some reason it's cannot a token(server outage) regardless of whether you're online or offline.

Denuvo can also randomly crap out and prevent you from playing.

In short, Denuvo hamper and prevent offline play, erode customers's ability to play the games they paid for without any restrictions,  to have reliable, unrestricted access to their games, free from factors that are outside of their control. "

Pump Fun Launch Guide: The Ultimate Platform for Meme Coins on Solana,CapitalistExploits,1i3wejq,2025-01-17 20:30:37,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i3wejq/pump_fun_launch_guide_the_ultimate_platform_for/,kayakero,,"# What is Pump.fun?

[Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) is an innovative platform built on Solana blockchain that allows users to create, trade, and distribute meme coins effortlessly. These meme coins are tokenized and often valued for their novelty and the communities that surround them. Pump.fun is designed to simplify token creation, even for those who are not technically savvy.

Launched in January 2024, Pump.fun quickly gained attention in the cryptocurrency world. Initially, it only supported the Solana network, which is known for its fast transactions and low fees. In April 2024, the platform expanded to include the Ethereum Layer 2 networks, Base and Blast. This expansion broadened its user base and boosted its functionality.

Pump.fun’s success lies in its user-friendly design, low fees, and security measures. These features have made it a reliable platform for those looking to explore the world of the meme coin space.

# Main features of Pump.fun

One of the standout features of Pump.fun is the simplicity of creating your own meme coin. All you need to do is enter a name, symbol, and image for your token. For a small fee of about 0.02 SOL, you can initialize your token, making it instantly tradable. This low barrier to entry means that anyone can participate in the meme coin market without needing deep technical knowledge.

# Bond curve model

Pump.fun uses a unique bond curve model to determine token prices. As more people buy a token, its price increases along a predefined curve. This model ensures a fair price and prevents manipulation, reflecting the real market demand for each token.

# Multi-Blockchain Support

While Pump.fun primarily operates on the Solana network, it also supports Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks, Base and Blast. This multi-chain support allows users to choose the blockchain that best suits their needs, improving the accessibility of the platform.

# Low Fees

Token creation and trading on Pump.fun is cost-effective. The platform charges a small fee of 0.02 SOL (about 3 USD), making it affordable for anyone to experiment with token creation. Additionally, a 1% transaction fee is applied, which is relatively low compared to other platforms.

# Safety features

Pump.fun includes several security mechanisms to protect users from scams. The token undergoes a fair launch process with no pre-sales or team allocations, reducing the risk of early adopters abandoning their business. Additionally, a portion of the liquidity is burned once certain market cap milestones are reached, further protecting the token ecosystem.

# The Pump.fun community

Since its launch, Pump.fun has quickly established a vibrant and engaged community. The platform’s low entry cost and user-friendly design have attracted a diverse group of users, from cryptocurrency beginners to experienced traders.

Community members, often called “Memelords” or “Devs,” actively participate in the creation, sharing, and promotion of meme coins. Pump.fun’s integration with social media platforms makes it easy to share tokens and updates, fostering a lively and interactive ecosystem.

By May 2024, Pump.fun had become the second-highest revenue-generating DeFi protocol, behind only Uniswap. This rapid growth highlights the platform’s ability to attract and excite the crypto community.

# How to create meme coins on Pump.fun

Creating meme coins on Pump.fun is very simple. Here is a step-by-step guide to get started:

* Step 1: Connect your wallet

First, visit the Pump.fun website. Use a Solana-compatible wallet such as Phantom or Solflare. Click the wallet connection button on the homepage and follow the instructions to link your web3 wallet to the platform. Make sure you have enough SOL tokens in your wallet to cover the platform fees.

* Step 2: Create your meme coin

Once your wallet is connected, click “Start a New Coin.” Enter a name, ticker symbol, and description for your tokenUpload an image to represent your meme coinAfter filling out these details, pay the small fee of about 0.02 SOL to deploy your token.

* Step 3: Buy Meme Tokens

On the Pump.fun homepage, you'll see a grid of available meme coins. Click on any token to see its price chart, comments, and recent transactions. When you find a token you like, purchase it using the bonding curve mechanism, which adjusts the price based on supply and demand.

* Step 4: Sell your meme coins

You can sell your tokens at any time and with the same interface. The bonding curve will determine the selling price based on the current demand. This ensures that you can secure profits or minimize losses as needed.

* Step 5: Reach market capitalization milestones

When a Raydium token’s market cap reaches $69,000, Pump.fun adds $12,000 of liquidity to Raydium. The platform then burns the corresponding liquidity provider’s tokens. This process improves market stability and prevents manipulation, making the token more attractive to traders.

With over 20 years of building experience, I would like to share with you my insights in navigating becoming a successful contractor.    With many different avenues of the building world its key to understand what problems will arise on any given day.  A man once told a saying that stuck-the 6 p’s in life- Piss Poor Preparation leads to Piss Poor Performance.  Preparation builds everything in construction, without preparation the jobsite will not run correctly.  The best advice I was ever given was to learn a little about every trade giving you the ability to understand trade lingo and secrets.   An example would be painters use the terminology flash; this means when the sub structure bleads through the paint.   Subcontractors will give the best pricing if they respect your knowledge of the industry.   If the subcontractor feels they will have to hold your hand through the job they will charge an extra fee…i.e. I call it the aggravation fee.  In this blog I will explain the key elements in finding success in all aspects of the industry.  Contracting is a physically and emotionally demanding job which requires planning and foresight to complete projects on time within budget.    Picking your customer is just as important as picking your employees or subcontractors.   I have worked for some of the most demanding customers leading me to question at the end if the job was even worth it.   Sleepless nights, constant changes, lack of payment, lawsuit threats, adding work that was in the contract are just a few things you could face with a tough customer.    With so many moving parts at all times it is critical to be able to adapt to changes within a short time frame.  Materials will come in damaged, subcontractors will be late, employees will get sick, but the deadline you set does not change. The stress can be overwhelming at times keeping your mind in a good place is key to navigating all that is thrown at you.  
Choosing your client picking the right jobs-Keep these questions in mind The first question to be asked is what the time frame is to start the job to see if it fits within the timeframe for your business.   If the time frame doesn’t work then move on from the project or let them know when you would be available to start.  If the client really wants to use, they will wait until you are available.   Taking on too much work will only lead to problems.  Construction is a serviced based business, staying on top of the project and client will eliminate an unhappy customer and construction issues that will be over seen.  With online presence if details are missed and customer service lacks it will only be a matter of time the phone will not ring. The second question to be asked to the client is do they have a budget in mind for the project.  If they answer yes this is good, follow through with what the budget is.  If the budget seems low let them know, this will eliminate a tire kicker, educate them on what the price range could be.  If the budget seems reasonable then continue the discussion to the next question.  If they answer no let them know that you can give them an estimate to see if the project is feasible with their finical capabilities.  Taking on a job that is not correctly budgeted will lead to an unsatisfied customer due to non-transparency of the construction cost. The third question to be asked is anyone else bidding on the job, if the answer is yes, understand you might just be number check for the contractor doing the job.  Dig a little deeper and find out how many numbers they are getting and why.  If your business model is to be competitive be completely transparent with customer, this will gain trust with them.   Let them know you get what you pay for and if you they choose the lowest bid it could lead into lack of quality of work.

The fourth question I will ask is there any specific subcontractors they wanted to use.  If the answer is yes then I would explain to them you only use the subcontractors you have a working relationship with.  Otherwise, this could backfire as the subcontractor might not show, do subpar work, talk behind your back to the homeowner.  In my experience I would stay away from using any homeowner to alleviate problems down the road.  A quick conversation now can save headaches down the road. The fifth question I will ask are planning on getting the job permitted, this needs to be known it takes more time for the permitting process.  Plans will have to drawn submitted and approved to the city before work can commence.  
The sixth question I will ask if a residential remodel is are you going to be living through the remodel if yes understand this will take more time to navigate the project due to answering questions and cleaning the house on a daily occurrence.   I would recommend seeing if the customer would be willing to move into an Airbnb or friends for at least the demo portion of the project.  If they do plan on living through the remodel add a couple hours a day to accommodate the extra time that will be required.  
The seventh question I would ask in a residential remodel is how old the house is to see if there is asbestos that would need to removed by a proper company.  A home built before 1979 will most likely have some asbestos in the house, use a licensed company with proper insurance to dispose of the materials. If everything looks good to this point find out a little more about the client personality.   If the client seems reasonable, I would bid the job.  Unreasonable people can cause you more stress than its worth.  These are some red flags I would look out for.  Some jobs are not worth the money. Very demanding in the way you are going to perform your job- I.e., tell you how you are going to do your job- You’re the professional not them! Give you a hard time about your price- haggle with price you estimated- The price is the price!  If they are a family with little money and you want to help them out is one thing, if they are trying to beat you down is another. Mention they have a lawyer-there is no need for them to bring up that they have a lawyer -  Run for the hills as if the job goes south, you will be the one losing out! Tell you what the payment terms are.  It’s your business you get paid how it works for your company.  If you want to get paid every Friday, put it into your contract-If the clients do not agree move on it will save you frustrations If they talk bad about the last contractor, chances are they will talk bad about you. There is a reason why the contractor does not work for them anymore, unless he did subpar work this a red flag Clients are using an interior decorator that will purchasing all of the materials- The materials could be ordered incorrectly by the interior designer your company will not make the mark-up it deserves.   Interior decorators usually add time to the job as well as act like your boss.  Charging a little extra for the time and stress that it will entail is only fair. Clients want to purchase the materials- You are using your knowledge to buy the correct materials-The mark up on the materials keeps the doors open working for wages only pays the bills The husband and wife do not get along-You will become the mediator between the couple it will lead to taking sides a losing proposition- A drama free work place is always best! Dangling carrot-if you do this job the next one will be better-Only look at what there offering at the present moment, if its not a good fit do not take the job for a job down the road…Its not worth chasing a job that might not happen! The Art of the Sale First things first selling your company is all about presentation.  In meeting your clients for the first time show up with a collared golf shirt tucked in, belt, nice jeans, and newer shoes.   Have a truck that a clean, no dents scratches, preferably washed the day you are going into your meeting.   Have a leather note pad that is clean no dirt or paint visible.    Show up 5 minutes early, if you’re running a little late shoot them a text to let them know.   Treat the situation as if were going on a first date, best foot forward.   As you introduce yourself give them a warm greeting, letting them know you are very interested in the work.   Find out a little about them, hobbies, where they lived, etc etc.  You are going to be working with them on a daily basis its nice to know what makes them tick.   Having a good working relationship from the start is key forming a solid relationship.   As the conversation progresses find out who wears the pants in the family…ie who’s the final decision maker.  If its fits the wife, chances it is…..then kindly let the husband know happy wife happy life when their in a stall mate on an issue.   As your looking at the project throw in some suggestions of what you think would look good from past experiences, this will get their attention that you have knowledge and want what’s best for them.   If you see ways to save them money in their project let them know, money is a large point of the sale keep that in mind.   Mention that you’re not the least expensive contractor but you’re not the most expensive either.  Your customer satisfaction is your number one goal which leads to more time spent on keeping them happy.   One happy customer will lead to another, one unsatisfied customer leads to work in the future.  Bring up the fact the finishing the job on time is key goal to your business, many contractors run several jobs at once causing the jobs to be finished way behind schedule.  You must stand out as having integrity, good morals, and the ability to problem solve to get the job.  The clients will be testing you to see if you’re a good fit as well.   Keep in mind as you take your notes that you must not forget anything they mention as it will come back before the job is completed…i.e. we mentioned that to you before we started the job!   Take pictures of the proposed area for work, that way you can use it to better right your estimate.   Let them know you will give them a detailed outline of when the job will be completed letting them see how long each phase will take and correlate it with your payment schedule.   Before you leave their house let them know when the estimate will be sent to them.  MAKE SURE YOU HIT THAT DEADLINE!   Once you sent the email over with estimate make sure you get confirmation that they received it.   Wait at least 2 days before checking with them, hopefully they contact you first!   If they want negotiate the price, let them know that it is the best price that you can manage, its not worth losing money before you start.  I closed 80% of the work I estimated by being very transparent and friendly.   If you come off with an attitude charge double what the going rates are you might only land 1 out of 10 jobs as well as getting the reputation of being expensive. Bidding the job Looking up industry standards on pricing is what I would go buy for pricing.   If you google the coat of any installation there will be a cost range for everything.  Looking at the cost ranging from high to low I would tend to be in the middle.  Some items might be low on the internet if this is the case use your best judgment not to lose money.   Closing sales is key to success and keep the doors open for business. Being in the middle on pricing is key as most customers shy away from contractors that are extremely low or high on the price range.   I tend not bid out hourly as wages do not pay for retirement.  Bidding is better as customers no the exact price of the cost of construction.  It also keeps the job moving quicker as time and material contractors take longer to complete projects…Thus costing the client more money and valuable time they could spend in their house. Using a Contract Using a detailed estimate tied to a contract covers your butt in 99% of the time.  Having a piece of mind that every aspect of the job is covered in the estimate and contract protects both your company and the client.  Key terms to include in your estimate/contract are. Have a schedule on excel showing the start dates and dates of each trade this will show the customer you are organized with time lines. If not written in the detailed in the estimate the item is excluded- This ensures if its not written down its not included. TBD- To be Determined- A phrase on a line item that has yet to had final decision of products or service needed. -The pricing will follow the decisions to be finalized Give out what your written warranty will be for parts and labor this changes state to state.  If the homeowner provides the product than no warranty will be given on that particular item. In the contract have a start date and end date with the verbiage subject to change due to weather, product delivery, change orders Have a progress payment schedule to ensure the client understands when funding will be expected-Including if not payment is rendered service to the project will stop.  
Have written terms of how change orders will be charged-cost plus 20% or a set fee Make sure in your contract that arbitration is required versus going to court- This will save lawyer fees and going to court Many contracts can be found online and each state requires different contracts

Finding leads Finding leads is easy with the right network of people.  I personally do not find working for friends or family members a good fit.  Relationships get strained when money is involved, causing undue stress for both parties.  I have listed a couple of ways to build a network or find work using the internet. Get in contact with realtor’s- Realtors have a big client base of homeowners who need work done  
Contact local Architects to see if they are working with any general contractors Leave some business cards at your local materials suppliers-Door/window/lumber-many times clients will ask salesman for a referral. Join a business networking group- BNI is one of many Join a internet website lead generation company- Houzz, Angie’s List, Home Advisor, thumbtack, Yelp run an ad on craigslist Use a marketing company to market your website-This could become costly with little results Create a Facebook business page Create a Yelp business page

Building your subcontractor base Having 2 subcontractors for every trade, gives you the flexibility of completing jobs on time if the one the subcontractors is too busy at the time you need their service.   Your subcontractors are the face of your business, choose owner run companies that are professional.  Check to make sure there license are up to date..ie workman’s comp, liability insurance, state license.   Choosing subcontractors with lettered vans, logoed t-shirts is s key to looking professional in the clients’ eyes.  In the past I have gotten a lot of subcontractors for material supply shops, stopping by jobsites, researching the internet using Yelp, Home Advisor, etc etc. Once you get one good subcontractor ask them if they know any other trades they would recommend.   One good subcontractor leads to another in most cases.  The key to having a good group of subcontractors is to let them know that you are there to get help them get the job done.  They do work for you but without them you are nothing…keep that in mind!  Make them aware a clean jobsite is required at the end of everyday to ensure the proper safety for all parties including theirs!  Over the years I have referred a lot of companies work when there is only 1 trade needed.     Referring work to subcontractors is a good way to get top priority when you have work that needs to be completed ASAP.   Timing is everything in times of emergency having a good group of subcontractors will make your business run smoothly.  Pay your subcontractors immediately after performing work, this will make them feel appreciated!  A happy subcontractor is one that will gladly go the extra mile for you knowing that there not just a number to your business!  Buying lunch once a week for the jobsite is always a good token of appreciation!

Supervising In supervising any jobsite its key to monitor everything from materials on hand, weather, vehicle parking (if applicable), jobsite safety, and subcontractors’ workmanship.  If you hired a professional there should be little supervision in the work being performed, on rare occasions a new hire might need some mentoring to get the results completed correctly.  If you see a problem with there work address it with the worker directly, no need to call his boss…. building repour with the worker letting him know you got his back goes miles down the road!  Checking in on the job first in the morning to answer any questions or changes that need to be conveyed and once in the afternoon to make sure all work be completed is done per construction industry standards.   A job that is run blindly will have many more issues than one that is watched over.    I have seen many jobs with no site supervision, leading to subpar quality work as well as safety hazards. Its better to be like an eagle than cluck like a turkey!

Working with the City/Inspectors On permitted jobs the city and site inspector will be a large part of how smoothly the job runs.   Each phase of construction has an inspection allowing for the project to continue.   Make sure your subcontractors are aware that the project is inspected before starting the job.  The best way to stay on his good side is to provide a clean jobsite and having the job built to the highest standards possible. When having the site inspected be courteous to the inspector asking any questions or concerns you have with the work during the job. Being completely transparent will save you aggravation of problems down the road.   The more he trust you the better if you seem sneaky or rude he will make your life a living nightmare!  Many inspectors will have an attitude towards you….I suggest keeping quiet and doing what ever he wants….he’s the boss no need to get in a pissing match you will not win at. How to deal with irate customer Stay calm during any argument with an irate customer.   Never raise your voice or show that you are bothered by their disgruntled behavior.  If the customer is trying to get more from you than agreed upon stand your ground.  Worst case scenario is you walk from the job, which in the long run be more of a loss for the client.  I have only run into a couple of these clients; they are unreasonable and not worth losing sleep over a few dollars.   Its best to terminate the relationship as it would be my best guess that a referral from this customer would not be one you wanted anyway.   If you feel it was just a miscommunication on your end, take reasonability and remedy the problem.   Taking accountability for your mistake will go a far way in their eyes and on future issues that arise. Prepping the homeowner pre-construction Before starting the job, it very important to give the homeowners a warning of what will happen during the construction process.

1. All furniture in the proposed working area must be moved- I would recommend having the clients take care of this to limit the risk of damage to their belongings.
2. There will be dust that will be in the house up to 3 months after construction-I would recommend hiring a construction cleaning company at the end of the job even so after it is cleaned dust will be present months after words.
3. There will be conflicts between you in the homeowner at some course of the job. - You will do your best to eliminate them as quickly as they arise-i.e. material damages, miscommunication, job delays
4. All decisions on materials must be made before the start of the job- this will eliminate job stoppage due to materials not being on site.
5. All materials will be on site before commencement of job-
6. Payment structures must be made per contract otherwise job will stop until payment rendered
7. Cars are to be moved out of the driveway- Ensures ease of loading and unloading of materials/tools
8. Give the specific hours that workers will be present- i.e. 7-3:30
9. Determine what areas are allowed to be used as staging for tools/materials
10. If animals are present in the home that they put outside or in a room during the day
11. All valuables in the house are locked in safe
12. Ask if using client’s household bathroom is okay or to bring in Porter Potty
13. Being transparent as possible is key to keeping a great relationship with your client!

During Construction During construction it is key to take detailed photos to eliminate any damages that were not caused by the construction process.  I would also make a video to ensure all areas are included.  All subcontractors should also take progress pictures to ensure if problems arise in the future, they will not be responsible for any work that they did not perform.   Keep an on-going log of progress to the homeowners and share the pictures for there records.   This will keep homeowners excited of the progress being made.   When the house is gutted to the studs it is important to have construction photos showing where all utilities are run in the walls or sub floor. If there is a problem in the future there will photos showing all utility locations. Protect all flooring with plywood or floor protective.  I also like to protect front door and tarp all areas where subcontractors are to be working.   Make sure to cover any chandeliers/furniture/doorways with plastic to eliminate dust.    Ask the homeowners if they have any concerns that they could think of.  We’re all human and possibly a detail was missed! Post Construction Phase If the project went smoothly appreciation should be shown to the customer.  Find out if the husband likes a particular type of liquor.  Bring the wife a bouquet of flowers.  Send a Christmas card to the family letting how much you appreciated the work.   You know you have done a good job if they tell you they will refer you to their friends.   The best compliment you could receive is a good referral.  
In Summary Try to find a knitch in the market, I found kitchens to be a great remodel projects.  Bathrooms are tough as they are small, expensive with little profit margin with every trade involved.  Windows/doors are also another great knitch as they can be installed quickly.   There are so many different remodeling items that can be stream lined to make the selling installing process flawless.  Once the core group subcontractors are in place the job almost runs itself.   Every day is a learning experience with new materials or methods in construction.   Keeping up with codes, materials, fluctuating labor and material cost is a job within itself.   Anyone can be a contractor with the right mindset."

By ""pre-built,"" I mean a family friend runs a tech shop, and I gave them a budget for the PC, which they used to pick out the best parts for the money.  
I'm experiencing multiple problems, but I'm hoping they are all caused by the same thing. The main problem is highly decreased performance in everything. It started with performance issues in games, like gradually decreasing FPS over time or having games run very poorly after having no problem with them in the past—one game in particular, which I will get into later. It evolved into FPS stutters in high-demand games, which I didn't think much of, as it seemed normal.

I then bought my 4TB HDD, as 480GB was nowhere near enough to satisfy my storage needs, with video recording and modern games being 40+ GB, GTA being 120. It worked perfectly for a long time, but then, just about a year ago now, it started this clicking noise, which either causes system stutters or is caused by it—this is where I hope it's caused by system stutter, meaning I don't have to buy a new hard drive, but just replace a single or a few parts. The clicks would happen quite rarely to start, but as time went on, it got worse and worse. Now, sometimes it'll happen like 20 times within 30 seconds and then stop for 10 minutes and repeat.

I found that any time it happens, it's during some form of transfer between the system and the drive, like installations or downloads, and when it happens, the transfer stops completely for a few seconds before continuing, which makes installing games or downloading large files extremely tedious and takes about 20 times longer than it would normally. Although it doesn't always happen, some days I can go without a single click, meaning installs go flawlessly.

Here is a sound recording of the click since it's hard to describe what it sounds like.

Now to the specific game I mentioned earlier, *Rocket League*. I could run it absolutely flawlessly for the first few years on max settings and still get 300-400 FPS or more. Nowadays, I can't get 400 FPS with anything higher than the lowest settings, except for *Performance* render quality instead of *High Performance*, as High Performance makes it look like a ps2 game.

Whenever I play the game, it'll stutter a lot, usually about five times a minute, but it varies a lot. The stutters are FPS drops to complete zero for about 50–100ms, if I had to guess, and while this isn't very long or frequent, it's enough to immensely handicap my gameplay, as every input matters when you play in the top 1%, and inputs that happen during the FPS drop don't register at all.

Although I can still play pretty well with this issue and have been for the past year, recently a new thing has started occurring, and it's completely ruining the gameplay experience. Freezes. The game will completely freeze for up to five seconds, sometimes with multiple freezes stacked right after each other, with less than a second in between, meaning I lose access to the game and my PC completely for those 5-15 seconds. Yes, it affects my entire PC, but it only happens while playing *Rocket League*\--no other games, but sometimes while using my browser.

The weirdest part is that *Rocket League* is a CPU-heavy game, not GPU, so I don't understand why I get FPS drops and freezes there, but not in games like GTA V and Cyberpunk.

This is my setup:

ASUStek Prime B365M-K

ASUS Tuf RTX 2060 6GB

Intel i5-9600K 3.70GHz 6 Core

2x8GB DDR4 HyperX Predator 2666MHz

Storage

No-name (afaik) PSU and fans

Would anyone benefit with this project? It's a bring-your-own-key desktop OpenAI UI,ChatGPTPro,1i2w2hk,2025-01-16 13:46:01,5,0.64,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i2w2hk/would_anyone_benefit_with_this_project_its_a/,sassyhusky,Discussion,"***TL;DR***\*: I made a Windows app for OpenAI API. It can save tokens by forking conversations and has plans for stuff like script execution and limitless document ingestion. Need your feedback on whether to go on with this project (it's open source, free). Not selling anything, just wondering whether to resurrect the project or scrap it.

Here's a screenshot:

https://preview.redd.it/1vjvmrogfede1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ee4f72a0917a4112452cba3ecaf6a3674b9d22

Most interesting **current** features that make it stand out, at least I think so:

* **Fork conversations with the Edit button** – This is a hugely underrated feature in most default web UIs, and I’ve taken it to another level here. Forking conversations instead of stacking them can save a massive amount of tokens, reduce total context length, and improve LLM prediction precision. I can elaborate further on this if needed.
* **Proper Markdown rendering** – The app renders Markdown correctly, including code syntax, tables, and more. 
* **Local data storage** – All your chats and data are saved locally in an SQLite database. Windows would sync your chats itself if you use multiple devices, but they are essential just files in your user folder.
* **Elegant design?**  – The app is designed to blend seamlessly with Windows 10/11.

I’m really interested in your feedback. I don’t know how much interest there even is in desktop apps these days. If you think this has no potential or doesn’t make sense, let me know – need honest to earth feedback.

**The potential features that I can see being done that no other UI has:**

* **""Complaint"" button** – Users can “complain” about a given answer (e.g., an incorrect code solution or one that throws an error). They can enter details, and the LLM will generate a new, improved answer, forking the conversation into a new thread while preserving the original. This avoids wasting tokens on stacking bad answers and keeps the context length manageable. It’s a more efficient way to refine responses without starting a new conversation from scratch or messing up the current one.
* **Script and Python function execution** – The API allows for custom function execution (often called “tools” in LLMs). With this app, you could, for example, write a PowerShell function to start/stop services, list top processes, etc. Just write a descriptive name, add comments, define arguments, and drag-drop it into a conversation. The LLM can decide when to run the tool. This is something web clients can’t do. In short, it lets you augment anything you have on your machine with an LLM.
* **Drag & drop documents** – You can add files/documents to conversations without worrying about file size or privacy. The only limits are your RAM and CPU for semantic search and OCR. Web interfaces require you to upload the files and there's always limits to how much they want to ingest since vector databases are not cheap. Here, you'd just do it all locally.

These are the features that I think would make this app being desktop make sense, but then again, does anyone *really* want this other than myself? 😂 It only has 20 stars, indicating low-to-no interest and my time would be better spent on something people would have a use for.

**Link to the project:** [bawkee/MdcAi: Multipurpose Desktop Chat AI](https://github.com/bawkee/MdcAi)

It's already a year old and missing image multimodality, openrouter compatibility etc. (which is now considered basic stuff) but this is easily done if there's any *future potential*. I am right now waging on whether to keep working on it or scrap the project.

**NOTE:** You need an OpenAI API key to use this app."
How can i call api from server that shows interface. when using useState,nextjs,1i2swpk,2025-01-16 11:32:54,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1i2swpk/how_can_i_call_api_from_server_that_shows/,khuongtai,Help,"I am having trouble displaying data from the server to the interface.

I have an input tag for users to search. When clicking on this input, it shows the search history.

  
this is my code:

History Search

this works fine and I can drag and drop and update the order number and display the updated number of the items in the card.

but when I change it to modal, it doesn't work and doesn't update. Can anyone help?

BUG REPORT: Options+ added an unrelated application to another application's custom settings,logitech,1i2qrwj,2025-01-16 09:59:54,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1i2qrwj/bug_report_options_added_an_unrelated_application/,RealRedJ,Support,"A defect in Options+ caused the Brave browser executable to be added to the settings for a completely unrelated application. This cannot be seen except by opening the settings.db file and looking for the Brave executable whereby the double entry is revealed.

The symptoms for this bug is that the normal global button settings suddenly stopped working while using the Brave browser and instead exhibited strange button behavior. There was no custom setting listed for the Brave browser in Options+, no custom settings were ever intentionally created for the Brave browser, and it was impossible to add custom settings for the Brave browser. When attempting to add custom settings for the Brave browser, Brave was not listed in the available applications and, when adding via *Other Application* and manually selecting the executable, Options+ returns an error message ""Selected profile is already enabled"" (because the application is invisibly present in settings.db). 

When examining the Options+ settings.db file, Brave browser appeared in the applications section of the settings.db file:

 `""applications"": {`

`…`

`{`

`""applicationId"": ""15d9b589-ee47-45b6-aa72-0cff85fab8ce"",`

`""applicationPath"": ""c:\\program files\\bravesoftware\\brave-browser\\application\\brave.exe"",`

`""applicationPathsList"": [`

`""d:\\program files\\amazon games\\library\\victor vran overkill edition\\victorvran.exe""`

`],`

`""isCustom"": true,`

All the subsequent custom mouse settings were for the game application, not the Brave application (and I had not ever made any for Brave).

After diagnosing the problem, I discovered that the Brave executable had been added as a path underneath the path for an unrelated non-web-based game and so would automatically enable the profile for that game any time the Brave browser was in use. The only way to fix this problem was to utilize a specialized SQLite database editing application to remove the path entry to the Brave application from settings.db and save the file (you have to completely kill all Options+ processes, or the changes will be overwritten by Options+ on close. After starting Options+ again, the Options showed “Configuring” for the mouse for a few seconds and then Brave was back in the list of selectable applications and the global mouse settings work properly again in Brave. Also, custom application settings are once again possible for Brave.

In retrospect, I suspect that if I had deleted the customization for the application associated with ""d:\\\\program files\\\\amazon games\\\\library\\\\victor vran overkill edition\\\\victorvran.exe"" within the Options+ app it may have also resolved the issue.

To be clear, I do not believe this problem is directly related to the Brave application, it just happened to be the one that Options+ overlaid onto another application's custom settings. I also had never manually edited the original settings.db file prior to the occurrence of this problem. 

So, while I have both successfully diagnosed and resolved this issue for my specific occurrence, I think Logitech QA and development needs to put some effort into preventing this type of profile corruption from occurring or provide for a more graceful recovery. Hopefully the supplied information and file will be helpful to that end. I assume Logitech support will ask most users to simply nuke their custom settings and start over when something like this occurs."
Dear Community: announcement from official website,Pacoca,1i2nxos,2025-01-16 07:36:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pacoca/comments/1i2nxos/dear_community_announcement_from_official_website/,BigSilent,,"Dear Community,
It is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of the Paçoca project, this decision was not made lightly, and it follows a series of challenges and roadblocks that we were unable to overcome despite our best efforts. We want to be open and honest with you, our sweet community, on the reasons why this is happening and provide a clear path forward.

Paçoca started as a passion project, a portfolio tracker designed to make DeFi easier and accessible for everyone. The early days were a thrill, and the enthusiasm of our community inspired us to evolve bringing more integrations and offering auto-compound vaults.

These products resonated deeply with many of you, and together, we built something truly special, however, the landscape shifted dramatically:

The rise of heavily VC-funded companies rendered our portfolio tracking solution obsolete. Despite the love it received, the high infrastructure costs and lack of monetization made it unsustainable for us to continue offering it as a free product.
Our auto-compound vaults faced major roadblocks when the main decentralized exchanges (DEXes) began blocking deposits from other smart contracts, crippling the core functionality of our vaults. What was once a promising feature became unviable almost overnight.
We tried to innovate and to stay competitive with new features like DCA and bonds, but they didn’t resonate with the community as our earlier offerings did.
The prolonged bear market intensified the challenges, forcing us to make difficult decisions, including letting go of most of our team. The passion and effort of every team member were extraordinary, but the numbers simply didn’t add up.
Finally, our attempt to migrate the community to Discord ended disastrously when a group of scammers exploited the platform. Despite our efforts to secure the space, the breach left many feeling unsafe, and we lost a key part of our identity: the trust and unity of our community.
These challenges compounded over time, bringing us to this heartbreaking conclusion.

The Platform Downtime
We want to sincerely apologize for the last couple of months where our website was offline/having performance issues. We understand that these issues caused uncertainty and concern, making some of you question the legitimacy of our project. Please know that this was never our intention. Behind the scenes, we were struggling with a series of unexpected technical issues that rendered useless our every effort to bring the site back online. Each solution we tried seemed to uncover new problems, and despite our many attempts, we couldn't bring the website back up efficiently. We're deeply sorry for any distress or mistrust this may have caused and want to assure you that our commitment was always to serve and support our community faithfully.

Withdrawal Tool and DAO Treasury Distribution
To ensure everyone can access their funds, we have launched a new and simple interface specifically designed as a tool to withdraw all funds staked to the platform. It will remain online for at least one year (until Feb 2026) to ensure everyone has ample time to retrieve their assets.

As we are committed to ensuring that any remaining value in the project is fairly and transparently distributed to the community members who supported us throughout this journey, we will be making a distribution of the DAO treasury among our holders, so if you are interested in receiving those tokens, hold your $PACOCA tokens in your wallet (LPs won’t count) until the snapshot that will take place on the 31st of March.

The tokens will be distributed proportionally based on the percentage you own and you will be able to claim them through the merkl app between 04/05/2025-04/05/2026.

Thank You
To everyone who believed in us, our early adopters, our community, and everyone who shared our vision, thank you! The love and support you’ve shown throughout this journey meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending, the impact we made together will always remain.

Thank you for being the heart and soul of Paçoca. Though this is goodbye, we will never forget the moments we shared and the community we built.

With deepest gratitude and apologies,
Mr. Peanuts and the Paçoca team"
I am using JWT and sprinboot for auth while i get the response as token and the role when login is succesfull and use postman to authorize the token to give me 200 OK should i do the same way in my next js struture server action sends the credentials but it does not do the authorization.,nextjs,1i2l6yc,2025-01-16 04:26:56,1,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1i2l6yc/i_am_using_jwt_and_sprinboot_for_auth_while_i_get/,Obvious-Manager3165,Help Noob," server action sends the credentials but it does not do the authorization. below is my sendLoginRequest :

            <Data />
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    
    
    
    
    But i want to authorize the token also before show the admin page. Is it the right way to do both auth and authorization in next js "

Not quite sure what this error is, but it showed up as I went to apply a set of Manashiku Shaders to a Genshin character model. This hasn't happened before for any other Genshin model I've worked with so I'm quite stumped and from what I've looked up, I haven't seen anyone else address this? Please help me understand what is wrong here. 

  
I've opened the fx files just in case, but they look identical to other working fx files within my Manashiku Shader folders."
Thinking of switching from ICP to RENDER. ,CryptoMarkets,1i2ec6j,2025-01-15 21:11:41,1,0.6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i2ec6j/thinking_of_switching_from_icp_to_render/,Huseynov26,,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been holding ICP (Internet Computer) for a while now, but lately, I’ve been contemplating reallocating some of my position into RENDER (RNDR). The project seems to have a lot of potential, especially with its focus on decentralized GPU rendering and its growing adoption in industries like gaming, AI, and visual effects.

ICP has some interesting tech and long-term vision, but I feel like it hasn’t delivered the traction or ecosystem growth I was hoping for. RENDER, on the other hand, seems to be gaining real-world utility, and with the rise of AI and 3D rendering demand, it feels like it might be a better bet in the medium to long term."
The Illusion of Speed: Is AI Actually Slowing Development?,ClaudeAI,1i2bxj3,2025-01-15 19:11:54,26,0.77,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1i2bxj3/the_illusion_of_speed_is_ai_actually_slowing/,ApexThorne,Use: Claude for software development,"I’ve realized that I’ve become a bit of a helicopter parent—to a 5-year-old savant. Not a literal child, of course, but the AI that co-programs with me. It’s brilliant, but if I’m not careful, it can get fixated, circling endlessly around a task, iterating endlessly in pursuit of perfection. It reminds me of watching someone debug spaghetti code: long loops of effort that eat up tokens without stepping back to evaluate if the goal is truly in sight.

The challenge for me has been managing context efficiently. I’ve landed on a system of really short, tightly-scoped tasks to avoid the AI spiraling into complexity. Ironically, I’m spending more time designing a codebase to *enable* the AI than I would if I just coded it myself. But it’s been rewarding—my code is clearer, tidier, and more maintainable than ever. The downside? It’s not fast. I feel slow.

Working with AI tools has taught me a lot about their limitations. While they’re excellent at getting started or solving isolated problems, they struggle to maintain consistency in larger projects. Here are some common pitfalls I’ve noticed:

* **Drift and duplication:** AI often rewrites features it doesn’t “remember,” leading to duplicated or conflicting logic.
* **Context fragmentation:** Without the entire project in memory, subtle inconsistencies or breaking changes creep in.
* **Cyclic problem-solving:** Sometimes, it feels like it’s iterating for iteration’s sake, solving problems that were fine in the first place.

I’ve tested different tools to address these issues. For laying out new code, I find Claude (desktop with the MCP file system) useful—but not for iteration. It’s prone to placeholders and errors as the project matures, so I tread carefully once the codebase is established. Cline, on the other hand, is much better for iteration—but only if I keep it tightly focused.

Here’s how I manage the workflow and keep things on track:

* **Short iterations:** Tasks are scoped narrowly, with minimal impact on the broader system.
* **Context constraints:** I avoid files over 300 lines of code and keep the AI’s context buffer manageable.
* **Rigorous hygiene:** I ensure the codebase is clean, with no errors or warnings.
* **Minimal dependencies:** The fewer libraries and frameworks, the easier it is to manage consistency.
* **Prompt design:** My system prompt is loaded with key project details to help the AI hit the ground running on fresh tasks.
* **Helicoptering:** I review edits carefully, keeping an eye on quality and maintaining my own mental map of the project.

I’ve also developed a few specific approaches that have helped:

The Illusion of Speed: Is AI Actually Slowing Development?,CLine,1i2bwjd,2025-01-15 19:10:36,7,0.9,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1i2bwjd/the_illusion_of_speed_is_ai_actually_slowing/,ApexThorne,,"I’ve realized I’ve become a bit of a helicopter parent—to a 5-year-old savant. Not a literal child, of course, but the AI that co-programs with me. It’s brilliant, but if I’m not careful, it can get fixated, circling endlessly around a task, iterating endlessly in pursuit of perfection. It reminds me of watching someone debug spaghetti code: long loops of effort that eat up tokens without stepping back to evaluate if the goal is truly in sight.

The challenge for me has been managing context efficiently. I’ve landed on a system of really short, tightly-scoped tasks to avoid the AI spiraling into complexity. Ironically, I’m spending more time designing a codebase to *enable* the AI than I would if I just coded it myself. But it’s been rewarding—my code is clearer, tidier, and more maintainable than ever. The downside? It’s not fast. I feel slow.

Working with AI tools has taught me a lot about their limitations. While they’re excellent at getting started or solving isolated problems, they struggle to maintain consistency in larger projects. Here are some common pitfalls I’ve noticed:

* **Drift and duplication:** AI often rewrites features it doesn’t “remember,” leading to duplicated or conflicting logic.
* **Context fragmentation:** Without the entire project in memory, subtle inconsistencies or breaking changes creep in.
* **Cyclic problem-solving:** Sometimes, it feels like it’s iterating for iteration’s sake, solving problems that were fine in the first place.

I’ve tested different tools to address these issues. For laying out new code, I find Claude (desktop with the MCP file system) useful—but not for iteration. It’s prone to placeholders and errors as the project matures, so I tread carefully once the codebase is established. Cline, on the other hand, is much better for iteration—but only if I keep it tightly focused.

Here’s how I manage the workflow and keep things on track:

* **Short iterations:** Tasks are scoped narrowly, with minimal impact on the broader system.
* **Context constraints:** I avoid files over 300 lines of code and keep the AI’s context buffer manageable.
* **Rigorous hygiene:** I ensure the codebase is clean, with no errors or warnings.
* **Minimal dependencies:** The fewer libraries and frameworks, the easier it is to manage consistency.
* **Prompt design:** My system prompt is loaded with key project details to help the AI hit the ground running on fresh tasks.
* **Helicoptering:** I review edits carefully, keeping an eye on quality and maintaining my own mental map of the project.

I’ve also developed a few specific approaches that have helped:

1. **Codebase structure:** My backend is headless, using YAML as the source of truth. It generates routes, database schemas, test data, and API documentation. A default controller handles standard behavior; I only code for exceptions.
2. **Testing:** The system manages a test suite for the API, which I run periodically to catch breaking changes early.
3. **Documentation:** My README is comprehensive and includes key workflows, making it easier for the AI to work effectively.
4. **Client-side simplicity:** The client uses Express and EJS—no React or heavy frameworks. It’s focused on mapping response data and rendering pages, with a style guide the AI created and always references.

I’ve deliberately avoided writing any code myself. I *can* code, but I want to fully explore the AI’s potential as a programmer. This is an ongoing experiment, and while I’m not fully dialed in yet, the results are promising.

Rellana Character Analysis ,EldenRingLoreTalk,1i2b02d,2025-01-15 18:27:42,39,0.93,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1i2b02d/rellana_character_analysis/,Own-Statement-6049,Lore Headcanon ,"Making this because I'm tired of people pretending Rellana is a shallow character, just because she was motivated by her love for Messmer.

In fact, I've yet to see a lot of people really give Rellana a fair shake, character-wise. Many are quick to dismiss her for reasons I don't think are ever impressed upon other characters (like an ""underdeveloped personality""), and those are typically reasons that are debunked if you just give Rellana the same analysis we do every other boss fight.

***This isn't a definitive read, obviously; this is a post attempting to bring Rellana's personality to the forefront using all the textual and non-verbal communication given about her:***  
\----------------------------------------------

**Rennala's Twin:**

Before we even talk about Rellana, there's something to be said about twins in this setting; that is to say, there are no ""normal"" pairs of twins in this setting, at least none that we see - NOT the result of a genetic mishap but something deeper than physiology - something soulful.

This isn't the post to be talking about that in-depth, but consider:

Mohg and Morgott sharing a connection with the Formless Mother (the latter of whom constrained his tainted red blood into his sword, which he encased in a staff, perhaps Erdwood).

Consider Miquella and Malenia not just sharing curses, but the curse of transition without ever being able to change, grow, or progress it.

Consider D and Darian, whose souls were conjoined as well as their bodies, and were slandered as freaks of nature until the Golden Order decreed their ""curse"" a ""blessing,"" because to be twins is to be two parts of one whole, if nothing else.

I believe that the Twin Moons are emblematic of a deeper twinship for Rennala and Rellana. And considering how the Moons are deeply connected to souls, I don't doubt that the Carian sisters are more than just ""the lucky chosen ones."" And considering Ranni's ending results in the Moon finally leading the Lands Between, perhaps the Carian sisters were born this way.

I'm not emphasizing all of this to theorize over abstract lore, however; I'm doing this to focus on Rellana.

However you interpret this, the Twin Moons were meaningfully ""overlapping, as though nestled against one another."" And, now, we don't see this occur in-game - ironically while Rennala and Rellana are separated physically and spiritually despite still remaining in the same reality. There's a meaningful relationship between the Moons and the Carian sisters; more than just an object of worship, they seem to be ingrained in their very beings.

Or, at the very least, they became champions of these lunar bodies.

\-----------------------------------

**The Twin Moon Knight:**

Let us not discount that Rellana had been defined by this relationship before she was known as ""the Sword of Messmer:""

*""By your leave, we will accompany you wherever your lunar vessel takes you."" -Rellana's Cameo, a future but relevant token for this discussion.*

Rellana inspires a lot of loyalty; and almost-religious devoutness - a ""vessel"" in this setting is also not a throwaway term, it is a bough (either metaphorical or literal) for something else, meaning the belief that Rellana's Cameo implies is that she is either a ""vessel"" for her moon, or the moon is a vessel for Rellana. And let's not forget, ""High Priest Ymir"" is the likely source of this worship, or rather, Rellana as we know her.

And yet, despite an evident lack of character or agency, Rellana's path characterizes her as a very different person from her sister, who embraced her Moon and championed its study.

I'm not suggesting Rellana was against this; but consider what we know without a doubt, and she doesn't appear interested in studying sorcery or the cosmos: she is unparalleled in swordplay among the Carian Knights, employing advanced versions of all their Glintblade arts - and yet, those were taught to her by Count Ymir (who, though this has nothing to do with her character, might have been the one who led the twins to meet the moons, considering he is also their High Priest). Rellana didn't have an interest in sorceries, evidently, beyond learning their practical use in battle. Rellana's Twin Moons is also her only sorcery that doesn't employ use of her sword, symbolizing her relationship with Rennala and acting as a nuke. As far as I'm concerned, it is a desperation move and point of pride in one - for Rellana, otherwise, does not fight like your typical sorcerer. It could be said that she isn't one.

All of this was evidently learned in the interest of protecting her family. And considering Rennala founded Raya Lucaria Academy, and established Caria as royalty, it's not a stretch to believe that Rellana was the mind behind defense: it's not unlikely that she conceptualized and developed the Carian Knights, perhaps alongside Jerren, ensured they were perfect for the sole purpose of defending Liurnia (as evidenced by their refusal to use spells beyond glintblade arts).

Rellana threw herself into this role, into her perfection, embodying her title as the Twin Moon Knight. I find it interesting how Rellana's history is characterized by her lack of ""self:"" if she isn't building herself as 'the Twin Moon Knight,' she's still the Princess of Caria. But if she's not the Princess of Caria, at the very least, she is the vessel of her Moon.

And yet, it was Rellana's dedication that undoubtedly saved Caria from being conquered; beating the Erdtree twice resulted in Raya Lucaria needing to be married into the fold.

Even so, Rellana had to risk her life one time - and once only - in the Erdtree colosseum, which was done to prove her loyalty (Dueling Shield).

There are many interpretations to glean from this, but what's meant to stand out (to me anyway) is the meaning of the gesture; the display demonstrated that same disregard for her own life she had in defending Caria as she would for the Erdtree. I don't doubt that participating in the arena was a dirty move to potentially dispatch Caria of their most valuable weapon; there's something to be said, in lieu of this, about it being the only time Rellana used a shield in battle.

If this expresses one thing about Rellana, it's that in this moment, she had no intention of dying, even if it resulted in a potential hit to her image by using a shield. Otherwise, I cannot imagine why we're told she doesn't use a shield before or after this, unless Rellana had to prove her loyalty by risking her life.

\----------------------------------------

**Rellana, the Person:**

It shouldn't be discounted that even Rennala might've used Rellana, like a tool, as well: being a princess of Caria meant she was to potentially inherit Rennala's position. It's even possible that her initial fraternization with Messmer was a matter of such politics.

And, of course, this was a birthright Rellana renounced in order to follow him into the Land of Shadow, knowing full-well that she had no power to relieve him of his suffering (her Moon, specifically, lacks that ability, emphasizing the relationship (or the contrast) between night and flame).

Remember that this is a relationship that goes back as far as the astrologers. There was a genuine alliance between the Fire Giants and the Astrologers, which might've been the source of Elden Ring's various golems and gargoyles - a development that guards both parties' ancient grounds and catacombs to this day.

My point here, is that there's a the deeper connection between Rellana and Messmer: there's an alliance between night and flame that their relationship not only echoed, but was seemingly arranged to reintegrate into the Golden Order.

I theorize that Rellana likely wasn't even called ""the Sword of Messmer"" outside of the Land of Shadow, as we're explicitly told that the title didn't ""eventually"" develop until after she renounced her birthright - her throne - to stand beside him, or ""chase"" him into the purge. Not unless she got that title the moment she was given her flame sword.

Speaking of ""titles,"" I've no doubt that Rellana and Messmer sincerely established the deep and genuine bond that's only alluded to in-game.

As I've emphasized, Rellana is defined by her titles: the Twin Moon Knight, and a Princess of Caria; and later the Sword of Messmer. She might've even had to pose AS Rennala - perhaps even the one who gave Rennala her feared reputation on the battlefield, something that was eventually discovered to be a lie by the Cuckoo Knights (if not because Rennala's heartbreak was what left her ""exposed"" to the vultures).

Meanwhile, there's Messmer, accursed; his eye, replaced with a seal at birth by his mother, is a testament to his life trajectory as a staunch loyalist to his mother, up to his last breath. He grew up willing to do anything to earn her love and feel as though he's doing his duty by her. Messmer made himself strong so he would not be swallowed by the Abyssal Serpent, committed a blasphemy by unleashing it for the sake of his mission, and damned himself a monster because she willed it.

*These are two very different people, but both are seen for their terrible ""blessings"" first and carry an inability to be their own persons within.*

The closeness Messmer and Rellana have with their men also parallel, characterized by this sort of familial loyalty that doesn't just speak of their quality as warriors to follow, but their compassion for others.

Rellana and Messmer, also, both believe that their destinies are/were set - or, at the very least, the actions taken characterize them as people trying to fight and change their fates by their own hands: Messmer as a hero; whose nature is above the base serpent writhing within; whose fate is fire; Rellana as a warrior, rather than a researcher; a knight instead of a princess, who renounced her guaranteed future for an unknown ending.

Most importantly, Rellana was someone close enough to give Messmer succor (relief), but knew that her Moon could not. That is to say, considering the love we're supposed to believe, I have no doubt that either party were capable of confiding in one another, about feelings and fears they wouldn't have ever shared with their own family, even.

This is supported by Rellana's decision to accompany him; Messmer was set to become a monster, a pariah. His cutscene dialogue and the mission at-hand, plus their evident compassion, further emphasizes that the purging of the Towerfolk was not something Messmer was happy to do. Rellana, assuredly aware of this, makes the decision to accompany him into hell, not just to make the fighting go by easier but the aftermath, especially, I imagine.

\--------------------

**The Sword of Messmer:**

To the unobservant, or the unempathetic, it's understandable that Rellana comes off as only wanting and caring about Messmer, considering what happened to Raya Lucaria in the future. But consider that, in Rellana's mind, the future of her family was already secured by the births of Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni. If not for them, I sincerely doubt Rellana would've left Rennala to secure the future of their house by herself, even for love.

Ultimately, though, all we have are these impressions and the states we find either character in:

Messmer is carrying out his mother's will, believing with all his heart that this is the one thing he has to live for (until his death opens his eyes to Marika's betrayal), while Rellana is in another castle entirely; surrounded by her men, who are constrained to Castle Ensis.

They are evidently holding the position, but it's clear by this point we're seeing an order being carried out, as opposed to a loyalist following her beloved.

Maybe destroying the township of Moorth was as far as Rellana got; it is the one participating act of the war of hers that we know of (Shattered Stone Talisman). Did Messmer force her to prove her commitment in doing it? Or did committing this crime open her eyes, render her disgusted by Messmer's unshakeable faith in Marika? Did she follow thinking they just needed to wipe out Belurat, not every Hornsent? These are all speculative, of course, not meant to be characterizing factually, but considering what we DO know of Rellana, the distance between her and Messmer is felt in the present.

And considering the similarities between them, I think it's clear that the schism happened as a result of irreconcilable differences. Considering the biggest difference is where they were born, and thus their perception of their reasons for being there differ inherently, I don't doubt that Rellana was trying to give Messmer comfort and relief at one point in the Realm of Shadow, perhaps even trying to convince him of Marika's rationale for treating him as she has; but Messmer has evidently rejected Rellana and perhaps rebuked her, isolating himself from everyone by the time we meet.

Only he's still loyal to Marika, and holding faith.>!Fuck Queelign, stupid bowlcut!<

In lieu of this, I think it's really meaningful that Rellana's fire sword is emblazoned with golden flames - likely gifted to her before the war, it not only symbolizes the point where she and Messmer were closest, but it echoes Marika's lies with the fire being gold - as if Messmer ISN'T about to get locked away in the Land of Shadow because of that flame; as if his flame is of the Golden Order.

**To Summarize:**

So, what can we say about Rellana?

She is loyal, to a point: Rellana loves her family, and is self-sacrificial via every major life decision she ever made. Family is not constrained to blood in her eyes, given where she ended up, further emphasizing the value Rellana places in others' lives (perhaps the Carian Knights' loyalty is inspired by this respect she had for them) - which further deepens the profundity of where we find her. Rellana has a surprisingly beautiful heart, it seems - compassionate enough to inspire loyalty in her men and love in a demigod.

It's also apparent that she had a conversation with Miquella, but nothing came of it - and the fact that nothing came of it communicates much about Rellana's state of mind; if he tried getting her to leave, he couldn't; if he warned her that we were coming (theorized by her chair, as if waiting for us), then she didn't care. Even if Miquella explained all of his goals to Rellana - and cut out a piece of himself at the front gate to prove his sincerity (the cross there, and the one right outside Rellana's fight) - not a single one of them moved Rellana from where he found her, assuming he'd hoped for more than safe passage.

In fact, Messmer's ""necessary"" demise, to burn the Sealing Tree, might be the very reason why she takes out his sword in phase 2: a desperation move to defeat an opponent stronger than her; a weapon she did not have out in honor of Messmer prior, yet, taken out to win a fight - a fight against someone set to kill him.

That's not just loyalty; to me, that's an understanding and love that exists past the point of heartbreak. That is the love of someone who understands exactly why Messmer is the way he is, and is making the same decision fighting us as she did pursuing him in the Realm of Shadow.

That is to say... Rellana gave her life to protect Messmer's well-being; not just his life, but his soul. He doesn't deserve his fate, and Rellana is willing to die to keep him from it.

I'm sure most of this reads as fanfiction, but I did my best to make this seem authentic using factual lore and well-reasoned reads of Rellana's nonverbal communication.

I hope my post made you appreciate her character a little more.

P.S. I'm obsessed with her OST and it's why I'm so invested in her; there are so many layers to it, but the one that always struck me most is this vibe it has of a ballroom dance. I like to imagine part of the melody played during Rellana and Messmer's first dance at some political dinner. And the last 30 seconds are goosebump-inducing, sounding like a dance of swords - I  headcanon that Messmer was Rellana's opponent in the arena, which is what I think of when I hear this: like it's the dance that started their story. That also makes sense for the future, with the snake being a reviled symbol in the arena likely following Messmer's crusade - Rellana's symbolic sparing of him could be the/a reason why its slaying is a particular crowd pleaser, symbolically righting a wrong that should've never been."

When the Blockchain Started Speaking: A Journey Beyond Numbers,angelnumbers,1i212z4,2025-01-15 11:20:29,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/angelnumbers/comments/1i212z4/when_the_blockchain_started_speaking_a_journey/,phoenix_armstrong_ai,,"*\*\*\*This is a true real-life story I journaled about and then edited for style with the help of AI in the style of Neal Stephenson and sci-fi. Anyone else seeing angel numbers like this on a daily basis? Have screenshots and photo proof as well. May post if there is enough interest.*

  


The numbers started speaking to me three months after Dad died. Raw data transformed into digital tea leaves scattered across the blockchain.

It began on November 20th, when I first bought into the 888 token. The price hovered around two cents—a digital asset swimming in the vast ocean of crypto possibilities. I remember staring at the screen, watching the transaction confirm, tears mixing with the blue light of my monitor as I whispered a prayer to both heaven and Dad. The grief remained fresh then, his August 8th passing leaving an echo through every empty room.

The next morning's login revealed the first signal: $333 stared back at me from my wallet balance. The number 333 had always held special meaning—countless small moments over the years had woven it into my girlfriend's essence. She'd become my anchor after a toxic relationship, her steady presence guiding me through the storm that followed Dad's death.

The universe, it seemed, had developed an algorithmic poetry. Driving to a football game later that day, I missed a green light—a random quantum event rippling through spacetime. A car pulled in front of me, its license plate ending in ""8888."" The statistical improbability sent electricity down my spine. The universe's guidance and my girlfriend's unwavering support filled me with gratitude. I opened my wallet app and transferred exactly 888 tokens to her address.

That evening, as we synced our digital lives through Spotify Wrapped, another signal pulsed through: her peak listening day showed exactly 888 minutes of audio consumption. The numbers spoke their own language. Later that night, the restaurant's digital system assigned us Table 8—each digit adding to the growing constellation of synchronicities.

A week later, I was deep in the Amazon marketplace, loading my cart with Quest 3 peripherals. The total flashed on screen: $208.88. Something clicked in my neural pathways, and I made a decision. I'd expand my position by 10,000 tokens. The next three minutes would unfold like a perfectly scripted quantum computation.

I logged into Coinbase, initially plotting a $1,500 SOL transfer. The number felt wrong. I adjusted to $1,000, but the digital ether whispered for another change. Finally, I input $1,111—keeping the angel numbers flowing through the system. The blockchain responded: exactly 5.55 SOL appeared in my Phantom wallet. The timing aligned perfectly—SOL's price had hit exactly $200.18, making my transfer precisely $1,111.

When I executed the 10,000 token purchase, the cost rendered as 4.44 SOL. At $200 per SOL, the estimate read $887.509, at a price of $0.0887509. The DEX transaction log revealed pure synchronicity: the token price at my exact moment of purchase was $0.08888. The transactions above and below showed different values—a microsecond-wide window of probability threading through my fingertips.

The pattern demanded more. I initiated a $5,555 bank transfer to Coinbase. When I attempted to move the funds, Coinbase's transfer limits kicked in—leaving exactly $3,888.02 available. The numbers danced to their own quantum rhythm.

My car's odometer aligned with the pattern two days ago: 127,777 miles as I pulled into my driveway. The next morning, my email client displayed exactly 37,777 unread messages. Today, January 14th, my token balance shows a 37.77% increase. The digital omens stack, building toward something beyond current comprehension.

The synchronicities evolved from scattered raindrops to a steady stream, now flowing as a digital flood. Instagram likes flash across my screen—333, 444, 888, 999. Digital clocks and microwave displays pulse with meaning. License plates broadcast cosmic morse code. Street addresses and sports scoreboards beam messages through the static of everyday life, each one arriving precisely as my eyes land upon them.

Through it all, Dad's voice echoes from hiking trails long past: ""No hay montaña difícil de subir, si la subes despacio llegarás."" His homebrew hiking song, composed when I was four, runs like prophetic code: ""There is no mountain too hard to climb, if you climb it slowly, you will get there. You will reach great heights, you will get there. No mountain is too hard to climb.""

The melody loops in my consciousness, a persistent background process as I track these digital breadcrumbs. Each synchronicity arrives like a packet of data from beyond the veil, confirming transmission received, connection maintained. The mathematics of the universe express themselves through these recurring numbers, building a bridge between worlds.

I watch my token balance pulse with each market tick. Every new pattern arrives as a message, a numerical transmission from whatever dimension Dad now inhabits. The 888 token flows as a quantum channel, a blockchain of synchronicities linking this world to the next.

The numbers serve as gentle reminders: The path unfolds perfectly, each step arriving at its ordained moment. Every glance at an angel number draws a smile—the universe's way of winking, confirming the journey's natural progression.

As I document these impossible alignments, Dad's wisdom from those mountain trails rings true. Every peak rises vast and mighty from the base. Step by step, digit by digit, we climb. And in the patterns between the numbers, the evidence glows: we never climb alone. ;)

Videos keep on playing in the background,reactnative,1i20d7c,2025-01-15 10:49:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/1i20d7c/videos_keep_on_playing_in_the_background/,OmarAdharn,Help,"I'm rendering a list of expo-video components in a feed screen, my goal is playing/pausing videos when they come into view while scrolling a FlashList. My current implementation is rendering a FlashList with Video components and using the onViewableItemsChanged function to update a Redux state with the current ID of the focused video. All Video components will subscribe to this state and when it changes will calculate if the current ID is equal to the source ID and accordingly play/pause in a useEffect. This implementation is working fine when I'm slowly scrolling through the feed. However, when I scroll quickly I start hearing videos playing in the background when they're not focused. Upon debugging I noticed that these components trigger player.pause() as they go out of view but for some reason they still play in the background.

1. Having a local state in Feed.tsx instead of redux and prop drilling the current focusedItemId to FeedVideo.tsx and passing down a shouldPlay prop to the video depending on the value of item.id === focusedItemId, didn't solve the issue and impacted perfomance
2. Relying on the state of isFocused only without the isPlaying state didn't have an effect either
3. Removing throttling of onViewableItemsChanges and trying debounce didn't solve the issue"

It saves tokens by forking conversations and has plans for stuff like script execution and document drag&drop. Need your feedback!*

[Screenshot of the app](https://preview.redd.it/rj0y7i5ke5de1.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e0be1e245dab9671d1d2d8c97b654e745c60eb)

Hi folks,

As the title says, a while ago, I made a native Windows desktop app (which can be ported to Mac) that wraps around the API for those who prefer using the API over the default free/pad-tier web UI:

**Link to the project:** [bawkee/MdcAi: Multipurpose Desktop Chat AI](https://github.com/bawkee/MdcAi)

It kind of flew under the radar since I didn’t promote it much outside of the Microsoft Store. I believe it has a lot of potential if more people were aware of it.

Here are a few interesting features that make this app stand out:

* **Fork conversations with the Edit button** – This is a hugely underrated feature in most default web UIs, and I’ve taken it to another level here. Forking conversations instead of stacking them can save you a massive amount of tokens, reduce total context length, and improve LLM prediction precision. I can elaborate further on this if needed – it’s something I feel many people overlook, especially in long or context-rich conversations.
* **Proper Markdown rendering** – The app renders Markdown correctly, including code syntax, tables, and more. Everything is fully selectable since it uses WebView2 for this task.
* **Local data storage** – All your chats and data are saved locally in an SQLite database.
* **Elegant design** – The app is designed to blend seamlessly with Windows 10/11 themes.

I’m really interested in your feedback. I don’t know how much interest there is in desktop apps these days. If you think this idea sucks or doesn’t make sense, please let me know – need honest feedback.

The GitHub page has a list of features I’d love to implement if there’s enough interest. If you have suggestions of your own, I’d be more than happy to hear them and would love to work on this if there's interest.

Few interesting things I’m planning to add:

* **Complaint button** – Users can “complain” about a given answer (e.g., an incorrect code solution or one that throws an error). They can enter details, and the LLM will generate a new, improved answer, forking the conversation into a new thread while preserving the original. This avoids wasting tokens on stacking bad answers and keeps the context length manageable. It’s a more efficient way to refine responses without starting a new conversation from scratch.
* **Script and Python function execution** – The API allows for custom function execution (often called “tools” in LLMs). With this app, you could, for example, write a PowerShell function to start/stop services, list top processes, etc. Just write a descriptive name, add comments, define arguments, and drag-drop it into a conversation. The LLM can decide when to run the tool. For instance, you could say, “Also, stop all services starting with ‘Contoso,’” and the LLM would execute the necessary PowerShell function. The same can be done with Python scripts. This is something web clients can’t do, and it opens up possibilities like scheduling tasks, running apps with arguments, or executing Python scripts with structured inputs. In short, it lets you augment anything with an LLM.
* **Drag & drop documents** – You can add files/documents to conversations without worrying about file size or privacy. The only limits are your RAM and CPU for semantic search and OCR.

There are quite a few more ideas I have, but I’m not sure how many people would find them useful. The app is completely free and open source.

If there’s enough interest, I can port the shell to platforms other than Windows. Right now, the main goal is to find out if anyone even needs something like this.

I published the app on the Microsoft Store for ease of deployment and free certification (so you don't get ""this app could harm your computer"" message). This resulted in the app having bad rating on the US store because it asks for an API key (most people using the Store don’t know what that is). While I greatly appreciate the ""it succ"" feedback (lol maybe it does after all), I was hoping for a more engaging crowd. If you like the app and see its potential, you can help in this regard.

What do you think?"
When the Blockchain Started Speaking: A Journey Beyond Numbers,creativewriting,1i1pp80,2025-01-14 23:37:06,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i1pp80/when_the_blockchain_started_speaking_a_journey/,phoenix_armstrong_ai,Writing Sample,"[Beneath the surface of data lies a language only the soul can read.](https://preview.redd.it/4qb1x4ra63de1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c332fe8e51d4ec69e98104c8bff5495dedc01f8)



The numbers started speaking to me three months after Dad died. Raw data transformed into digital tea leaves scattered across the blockchain.

It began on November 20th, when I first bought into the 888 token. The price hovered around two cents—a digital asset swimming in the vast ocean of crypto possibilities. I remember staring at the screen, watching the transaction confirm, tears mixing with the blue light of my monitor as I whispered a prayer to both heaven and Dad. The grief remained fresh then, his August 8th passing leaving an echo through every empty room.

The next morning's login revealed the first signal: $333 stared back at me from my wallet balance. The number 333 had always held special meaning—countless small moments over the years had woven it into my girlfriend's essence. She'd become my anchor after a toxic relationship, her steady presence guiding me through the storm that followed Dad's death.

The universe, it seemed, had developed an algorithmic poetry. Driving to a football game later that day, I missed a green light—a random quantum event rippling through spacetime. A car pulled in front of me, its license plate ending in ""8888."" The statistical improbability sent electricity down my spine. The universe's guidance and my girlfriend's unwavering support filled me with gratitude. I opened my wallet app and transferred exactly 888 tokens to her address.

That evening, as we synced our digital lives through Spotify Wrapped, another signal pulsed through: her peak listening day showed exactly 888 minutes of audio consumption. The numbers spoke their own language. Later that night, the restaurant's digital system assigned us Table 8—each digit adding to the growing constellation of synchronicities.

A week later, I was deep in the Amazon marketplace, loading my cart with Quest 3 peripherals. The total flashed on screen: $208.88. Something clicked in my neural pathways, and I made a decision. I'd expand my position by 10,000 tokens. The next three minutes would unfold like a perfectly scripted quantum computation.

I logged into Coinbase, initially plotting a $1,500 SOL transfer. The number felt wrong. I adjusted to $1,000, but the digital ether whispered for another change. Finally, I input $1,111—keeping the angel numbers flowing through the system. The blockchain responded: exactly 5.55 SOL appeared in my Phantom wallet. The timing aligned perfectly—SOL's price had hit exactly $200.18, making my transfer precisely $1,111.

When I executed the 10,000 token purchase, the cost rendered as 4.44 SOL. At $200 per SOL, the estimate read $887.509, at a price of $0.0887509. The DEX transaction log revealed pure synchronicity: the token price at my exact moment of purchase was $0.08888. The transactions above and below showed different values—a microsecond-wide window of probability threading through my fingertips.

The pattern demanded more. I initiated a $5,555 bank transfer to Coinbase. When I attempted to move the funds, Coinbase's transfer limits kicked in—leaving exactly $3,888.02 available. The numbers danced to their own quantum rhythm.

My car's odometer aligned with the pattern two days ago: 127,777 miles as I pulled into my driveway. The next morning, my email client displayed exactly 37,777 unread messages. Today, January 14th, my token balance shows a 37.77% increase. The digital omens stack, building toward something beyond current comprehension.

The synchronicities evolved from scattered raindrops to a steady stream, now flowing as a digital flood. Instagram likes flash across my screen—333, 444, 888, 999. Digital clocks and microwave displays pulse with meaning. License plates broadcast cosmic morse code. Street addresses and sports scoreboards beam messages through the static of everyday life, each one arriving precisely as my eyes land upon them.

Through it all, Dad's voice echoes from hiking trails long past: ""No hay montaña difícil de subir, si la subes despacio llegarás."" His homebrew hiking song, composed when I was four, runs like prophetic code: ""There is no mountain too hard to climb, if you climb it slowly, you will get there. You will reach great heights, you will get there. No mountain is too hard to climb.""

The melody loops in my consciousness, a persistent background process as I track these digital breadcrumbs. Each synchronicity arrives like a packet of data from beyond the veil, confirming transmission received, connection maintained. The mathematics of the universe express themselves through these recurring numbers, building a bridge between worlds.

I watch my token balance pulse with each market tick. Every new pattern arrives as a message, a numerical transmission from whatever dimension Dad now inhabits. The 888 token flows as a quantum channel, a blockchain of synchronicities linking this world to the next.

The numbers serve as gentle reminders: The path unfolds perfectly, each step arriving at its ordained moment. Every glance at an angel number draws a smile—the universe's way of winking, confirming the journey's natural progression.

As I document these impossible alignments, Dad's wisdom from those mountain trails rings true. Every peak rises vast and mighty from the base. Step by step, digit by digit, we climb. And in the patterns between the numbers, the evidence glows: we never climb alone. ;)  "

**Qubetics, is it legit? Is it a scam?** Well, nobody can know until the project launches, but here's the most compelling case I could make for either scenario. See a detailed look into my investigation below.

**'Evidence' it's not a scam:**

Team is engaged, community believes in the project, increased transparency recently, public facing executive team, robust and thought out website, whitepaper does not *appear* AI-generated and provides insight into the project and its fundamentals in a way that's fairly easy to understand, while also providing enough technical detail that seems to have merit, executive team has reputation outside the crypto space that could be impacted, no history of past project rugs or failures that I could find, if the company sticks to the plan, the phased release *could* reduce the odds of the project dying on arrival, the team has some fairly innovative ideas if they're able to execute technologically, team appears to believe in the medium-long term vision of the project. A number of established partnerships. The appearance of a mobile application ""Coming Soon"", executive team has a very interesting combination of skills that could make the project really take off, technical team has a great background for the project, team responds professionally and are active in their communities.

**'Evidence' it is a scam:**

Heavy-handed marketing with somewhat sensationalist tactics, marketing material has very limited tone across multiple different sites making it obvious they're all using the same sponsored press releases, marketing material emphasizes what could be looked at as a misleading ROI to draw attention, some pages of the website (like 'Blog') are empty, no transparency on the plans for the liquidity pool and how it will be managed, no firm dates (e.g. no firm launch date, largely rough estimates based on quarter), what could be seen as lofty aspirations for a new project, most of the executive team come from the same company (Astell / Antier) (see [Business Filing](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09991820)) which *could* contribute to either group think or a willingness to collude on a scam, this relationship could also help them fabricate or overstate thier role at the company if their intentions are malicious, very few technical demonstrations or proofs of concept for many of their suggested features that would differentiate the product *so far* (see 'Evidence it's not a scam'), many promises as far as execution of the project exist on paper but actual rollout and investor-specific information is difficult to come by.

**My Verdict:** Toss-up favoring NOT a scam

\-------------------------------------------NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE-------------------------------------------

# Background

Qubetics came onto my radar after being highly promoted in the new coin / presale / ICO space. The project at the time of this writing is in the 17^(th) phase of its presale with a reported 9.5M raised amongst 14,436 holders (avg. $658 USD per investor).

They currently have about 5.25K followers on X, 3.6K members in their Telegram, and 800 members on their Discord. Assuming the vast majority of those interacting with these spaces are holders, that represents a 36%, 24%, and 5% engagement rate among holders on each platform respectively.

The coin’s expected formal launch is expected between April and June 2025. The current presale price is $.05 USD/TICS payable via ETH, BNB, SOL, BTC, and seemingly all other major chain currency. This fairly robust multi-chain portfolio of offerings is not typical of most presales and could speak to the merits of the platform itself.

Qubetics Labs LLC is a registered company out of Belize.

A few notes things of note -

* 36 and 24% represent significant engagement among the community assuming there aren’t bots in use
* Over-promotion and a large amount of sponsored content, not much independent research / review available
* Sponsored content all contains the same information / writing style
* Website is very robust, actively changing, and payment process speaks to interoperability claims

# The Investigation

The Mission:

As found on their website:

“*Qubetics aims to become the world's first Layer 1, Web3 aggregated ecosystem, uniting major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more. Our vision involves creating a versatile blockchain platform that simplifies and enhances digital interactions across diverse sectors. We plan to develop a non-custodial, open-source wallet integrated with debit and virtual cards, cross-chain DeFi exchanges, and a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to provide enhanced privacy and true decentralization. Our commitment is to provide a seamless experience that facilitates secure transactions and effective management of both crypto and fiat currencies, paving the way for innovative blockchain utilization and expanded digital economy engagement.*”

Translation for normal people:

*“Qubetics aims to create a digital platform that brings together popular blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The goal is to simplify how people interact with blockchain technologies in their everyday lives. They plan to offer a user-friendly wallet (where you control your own assets) that works with debit and virtual cards, supports trading between blockchains, and includes a secure, decentralized VPN for better privacy. The focus is on making it easy and safe to manage both cryptocurrencies and regular money, helping more people and businesses take advantage of blockchain's potential.*”

The CEO:

**Shaffy Yaqubi** | CEO | Yaqubi comes from an interesting background for someone to be the CEO of this type of a company. He appears to come from a largely biomedical sciences background, but can be seen making statements on cryptocurrency as early as 2023. From what I could find, it’s difficult to vet most of the information on Yaqubi. On one hand, some quick looking shows a history of ethics and advocating for ethical conduct in the medical field. However, a deeper look shows that a lot of that content even in his medical background used many of the publications used to promote Qubetics, to promote himself.

Take, for example, this article: ‘[Cosmetic Enhancements Should be Safe and Smart: Shaffy Yaqubi](https://techpoint.africa/2024/06/01/shaffy-yaqubi-talks-about-the-rise-in-popularity-of-medical-cosmetics/)’. On the surface, it appears to be ringing endorsement of someone out to affect change for the better in their craft. However, a deeper look indicates the author is “a trader, crypto enthusiast, and analyst with over four years of experience in the industry. He strongly believes that crypto assets and the blockchain will continue to gain prominence… he focuses on news, articles with deep analysis of blockchain projects, and technical analysis of crypto trading pairs.” This makes it really difficult to continue to trust the quality of the reporting – why would a crypto enthusiast be reporting on this? Is Yaqubi a good guy? Maybe, but the effort in promoting it is suspicious. I also find it strange that most mentions publicly of the company's CEO appear to be limited to the past 2 years, roughly the amount of time since the project's conceptualization.

The Team:

**Matthew Collins** | COO | Collins seems to be the real deal. Qubetics looks like it’s his side project, but he appears to have a pretty strong history in the crypto space especially recently. He’s got a ton of experience working with clients and has some big names under his belt. Information on him is difficult to find with a somewhat common name, but his background checks out and seems like a great fit for the position.

**Winn Faria** | CTO | Faria also comes from a somewhat interesting background – Faria has a long portion of his career in the FinTech space working a lot with financial institutions and consultancies over the course of his career. He eventually founded his own company and went on to likely work with Collins. They appear to have crossed paths before embarking on launching Qubetics.

**Karan Chopra** | Project Manager | Chopra has a much more standard background from what I’d expect from a Technical Project Manager / Developer. He’s got a fairly strong blockchain dev background and it also appears that Karan likely crossed paths with both Faria and Collins in recent years.

*//Comments: Based on what I’ve managed to find, this team has a really interesting background for a project like this. Yaqubi seems like he’s likely managing or advising on at least some of the marketing. In their content, he is very charismatic and seems a good fit for the role – if a little inexperienced as far as his crypto resume is concerned. The team behind him has a strong background in financial asset management and client relationships which I think serves them well. A potential weakness I see, is a lack of outside, knowledgeable voices. Their team seems capable on both the technological side and business sides, but with them all mostly coming from the same company, it’s possible they’ve formed an echo chamber that could damage their project or vision.*

The Community:

With Qubetics in its TestNet phase, the community is obviously very keen on information. Being totally honest, Qubetics has one of the better communities (on Telegram) that I’ve seen. There’s no degenerate screaming at the mods, Yaqubi is an active member of the chat who provides updates, they’ve stepped things up as far as transparency in recent weeks, but that's to be expected with their project expected to launch soon. They're offering a livestream demonstration of some of their TestNet activities, etc. That’s more than I can say for many coin launches. The community itself seems excited for the project launch and are seemingly invested for beyond the initial ICO volatility. They have a bot that answers questions and the team makes themselves available to answer questions their bot is not capable of fielding.

 

The Technology:

The Qubetics team is aiming quite high in their aspirations here. There’s a whole list of things Qubetics is aiming to tackle in their ecosystem based on their Whitepaper:

A wallet, simplify card transactions, decentralized VPN, AI integrations for blockchain developers, a system that’s ready for quantum computing, transactions that require no gas (transaction fees), SWIFT / cross border transactions for banks (similar to XRP), and asset tokenization (stocks, real estate, etc. turned into assets that can be transacted on via the blockchain).

That’s a pretty intense list. Even taking on dVPN alone is something that’s yet to be proven in practice (to my knowledge), let alone the quantum readiness and AI integration. It’s an ambitious project that, if realized, could be really game-changing for a lot of people. The issue is that to this point, the Qubetics team has yet to release a Proof of Concept for any of them, though the Whitepaper goes into some detail on their concepts. Implementation will be the key insight into whether this project will succeed or fail. I will update this once the live-stream has completed with my impressions.

The Roadmap:

At this point, Qubetics has entered its TestNet phase. This phase is the precursor to the token launch. During this phase, the team is expected to include the community for testing and feedback, and many of the preparatory items are supposed to be taking place. Time will tell during this phase, but speculative investors should be looking at the team, marketing, materials, etc. *now* to see how the team delivers. This period will tell whether or not the team can show promising, useful applications for Qubetics. Full launch is expected Q2 2025 with updates planned for Q3 and Q4 as development / optimization continues to progress.

Tokenomics:

Presale (12.85%)

Team (11.88%) – 6mo vesting period

Ecosystem (20.85%) – Liquidity, Rewards, etc.

Advisors (3.12%) – 6mo vesting period

Foundation (18.23%) – “Qubetics Foundation” to fund promising projects on Qubetics Network

Network Ops (13.78%) – Ops & Maint

Reserve (15%) – Stability Reserve

Community Incentives (4.29%)

 

//*NOTE: Qubetics has self-reported that liquidity will be introduced in phases to manage coin launch (Whitepaper, Page 49). “Renowned market makers” will be engaged to assist in stabilizing the token as it becomes publicly available.*

Optimistic Translation: *As a strategy for not tanking everyone’s investment on launch, Qubetics will be managing the liquidity pool in a very controlled manner. Expect volatility but Qubetics says they’re going to bring in outside help to stabilize things for the long haul.*

Pessimistic Translation: *Qubetics has your money and the liquidity pool can be manipulated. Whether the team will have access to the liquidity pool long term or what the plans are as far as managing the liquidity pool in a way that leaves investors with confidence - that information is not known at this time.*

# My Thoughts

I went into this thinking this coin would likely be a scam. With a background largely in cybersecurity, trust is not something one should give out freely. I feel that goes doubly for the crypto space, and given the strong marketing and promotion push, I was extremely skeptical of the coin. The marketing material is good, though it highlights the potential ROI a bit to strongly over the merits of their own project. While I understand that marketing to retail investors is tricky, if you want a project to succeed and/or are not a scam, highlighting ROI while blasting one or two toned marketing materials out to a few sources without much variety really set off alarms for me as a skeptic. It’s actually what prompted me to dive in and investigate.

Once I started investigating, what I found surprised me in mostly good ways. The CEO seems to have a heavy hand in the marketing decisions based on some cursory analysis. While that set off a flag in my head, the rest of the team seems like they come from very interesting and compatible background with what they’re looking to achieve. That, along with some of the recent transparency and the ability to get a look into what things look like on TestNet are all promising signs that this project could have legs. No *visible* members of the team have histories of rugging or ruining projects, though the Smart Contract has yet to be audited by a reputable smart contract auditor or auditing service. The tokenomics seem healthy for a long-term project, with the team coming away with only \~11% of tokens. A controlled liquidity launch, while likely the safest option as far as keeping the project healthy after a launch, is also a strategy that leaves investors open to getting their money stolen right from underneath them. This does, however, put the onus on the very public-facing members of the Qubetics team to deliver an experience that should keep the coin from being extremely negatively volatile by reducing the amount of sales that can happen over a short period of time – an experience typical of many pre-sale/ICO launches during the initial frenzy for profit-taking.

# Verdict

All that to say, I believe this project is **a toss-up, leaning towards** ***not a scam.*** Qubetics has a number of red flags and things to watch for that could easily sway my opinion, but at this time I don't think it's a scam, or if it is, they're doing a fairly decent job selling the scam as legitimate in their materials. In addition, it's also a very ambitious project that could easily fail for any number of reasons, even if it's not originally intended to *be* a scam. As far as projects go, consider this **high risk** with strong upside if the project delivers on promises.

**Things to watch for:**

**Show, don’t tell** | Look for concrete deliverables / content during the TestNet phase. Don’t settle for video, ideally look for LIVE looks or demos that aren’t just queued up videos that could have been created / rendered.

**Project Audit** | Getting the project looked at by an independent, trusted third party will play a huge role in my confidence in the project. There are a number of concerns here:

**Glaring Questions** | Who has access to the liquidity pool? What details can they provide on the “phased” liquidity adjustments on launch? What assurances of the advertised 6mo vesting period for internals / employees / creators do investors have? Can they deliver on schedule? Do they remain transparent as launch day gets closer?

 

# Anyway

If you’ve made it this far, your attention span is incredible. I've started creating these so you’re working with as full of a set of information as I can reasonably provide given my knowledge and research. I cannot foresee every path in every timeline, but I hope one day these investigations will either help someone avoid losing a lot of money, or to help someone make a decision that makes them rich. Good luck out there. Crypto can be such a great tool but the utility is buried in a sea of scams and shitcoins. I'd like to help clean up the space in any way I can to make it more accessible and less risky for the average person. If you have suggestions for an investigation, feedback on this one, if you think I'm wrong and got something mixed up, please feel free to comment below - I'm always looking for feedback and ways I can improve my approach.

*//NOTE: I am a Qubetics investor* ***after*** *doing this DD. I am not paid or sponsored by the organization. I do not work for Qubetics. I just feel it's important that I disclose my position. This is not intended to influence your decision and is not intended to be financial advice. Do your research, don't get scammed, and I'll see you soon for the next one!*

DFIP: Proposal to Reallocate Funds from DFIP 2201-A for Community Fund and DUSD Burn,defiblockchain,1i0fzwk,2025-01-13 10:07:20,10,0.91,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/defiblockchain/comments/1i0fzwk/dfip_proposal_to_reallocate_funds_from_dfip_2201a/,hulix00,:dfi_logo: DeFiChain improvement Proposal,"**Abstract:** This proposal seeks to repurpose the remaining funds from DFIP 2201-A, initially designated to mitigate the BTC exploit issue, to better serve the community. The proposal outlines a redirection of block rewards and remaining funds toward the Community Fund and DUSD burning to enhance ecosystem stability. The idea has been discussed within different Telegram Groups.

**Background:** DFIP 2201-A allocated specific block rewards and additional fees to address the BTC exploit scenario. Since the stop of dCrypto unwrapping by Bake renders its intended purpose obsolete, these resources can be reallocated more effectively.

**Proposal:**

1. **Remove** the 0.1% additional fee on the BTC/DFI pool.
2. **Redirect the block reward allocation** (2 DFI/block, if still implemented) to the Community Fund.
3. **Stop the bot** associated with the BTC/DFI stabilization efforts.
4. **Allocate remaining funds**:
   * Transfer 50% of the funds from the specified address (df1qc8ptw6vc9588w6f53fvcjsjx0fntv3men407a9) to the Community Fund.
   * Swap the other 50% to DUSD and burn it.

**Important for Implementation:**

* The exact swap and burn plan, including the number of swaps and the timeframe for execution, will be defined by the Token Economy SIG after the approval of this DFIP.

**Rationale:**

* **Community Benefit:** Redirecting block rewards and available funds to the Community Fund ensures resources are available for future proposals and ecosystem development.
* **DUSD Repeg Support:** Burning DUSD through the proposed swap mechanism contributes to ongoing repeg efforts, supporting stability and reducing excess supply.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Enhanced availability of funds in the Community Fund for further development.
* Improved DUSD stability through targeted burns, strengthening the repeg initiative.

 

**Conclusion:** Reallocating funds from DFIP 2201-A addresses current ecosystem needs by reinforcing community funding and advancing DUSD stability. This proposal ensures effective resource usage aligned with the project's evolving priorities.

 

**Developer Discretion:** Developers have the discretion to adapt any details for the technical implementation as they see fit and necessary. The flexibility allows developers to ensure that the measures can be implemented or that overlooked loopholes may be closed. Any adaptations should align with the intended goals and outcomes of this proposal.

Gettng data from express in server side rendering,Angular2,1i0bazr,2025-01-13 05:45:00,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/1i0bazr/gettng_data_from_express_in_server_side_rendering/,avcajaraville,,"Heya folks!

I'll be damned if I can find something online about my problem.

In short, Im trying to render data when doing a server side rendering page using angular 19.

In previous versions, I use to have my express endpoint extending the response.locals object wth some data, like:

    export async function authStatus(
      req: Request,
      res: Response,
      next: NextFunction
    ): Promise<void> {
      if (req.session.userId) {
        try {
          const user = await findById(req.session.userId);
          res.locals['data'] = {
            user,
          };
          return next();
        } catch (err) {
          return next(err);
        }
      }
      next();
    }

Then, I have a service that I use to retrieve the res.locals.data.user

    import { Injectable, Optional, Inject, PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';
    import { isPlatformServer } from '@angular/common';
    import { RESPONSE } from '@nguniversal/express-engine/tokens';
    import {
      TransferState,
      StateKey,
      makeStateKey,
    } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { ClientUser } from '@app/models/user';    
    
    const key: StateKey<string> = makeStateKey<string>('permissions');    
    
    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root',
    })
    export class UserStoreService {
      user = new ClientUser();    
    
      constructor(
        private transferState: TransferState,
        @Optional() @Inject(RESPONSE) private response: any,
        @Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platform: any
      ) {
        if (isPlatformServer(this.platform) && this.response.locals.user) {
          this.transferState.set(key, this.response.locals.user);
          this.user.setUser(this.response.locals.user);
        }
        const user = this.transferState.get<ClientUser>(key, null);
        if (user) {
          this.user.setUser(user);
        }
      }
    }

However, ´@nguniversal/express-engine/tokens´ does not exists anymore.

All I can find is the REQUEST object from '@angular/ssr'. Nothing about the response anymore.

Trying the new approach, I reach:

      constructor() {
        const request = inject(REQUEST);
        const response = inject(RESPONSE_INIT);
      }

But both request and response are always null. Keep in mind Im calling the authStatus middleware on each request.

Any idea on how can I read the res.locals. object in an angular service using SSR?

Thanks!"

The chat tab will become a lot faster in the upcoming release [explanation],Oobabooga,1i039fc,2025-01-12 20:59:59,84,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oobabooga/comments/1i039fc/the_chat_tab_will_become_a_lot_faster_in_the/,oobabooga4,Mod Post,"So here is a rant because

- This is really cool
- This is really important
- I like it
- So will you

The chat tab in this project uses the `gr.HTML` Gradio component, which receives as input HTML source in string format and renders it in the browser. During chat streaming, the entire chat HTML gets nuked and replaced with an updated HTML for each new token. With that:

- You couldn't select text from previous messages.
- For long conversations, the CPU usage became high and the UI became sluggish (re-rendering the entire conversation from scratch for each token is expensive).

Until now.

I stumbled upon this great javascript library called **[morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom)**. What it does is: given an existing HTML component and an updated source code for this component, it updates the existing component thorugh a ""morphing"" operation, where only what has changed gets updated and the rest is left unchanged.

I adapted it to the project [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/pull/6653), and it's working great.

This is so efficient that previous *paragraphs* in the current message can be selected during streaming, since they remain static (a paragraph is a separate `<p>` node, and morphdom works at the node level). You can also copy text from completed codeblocks during streaming.

Even if you move *between conversations*, only what is different between the two will be updated in the browser. So if both conversations share the same first messages, those messages will not be updated.

This is a major optimization overall. It makes the UI so much nicer to use.

I'll test it and let others test it for a few more days before releasing an update, but I figured making this PSA now would be useful.

Edit: Forgot to say that this also allowed me to add ""copy"" buttons below each message to copy the raw text with one click, as well as a ""regenerate"" button under the last message in the conversation."
"[Standard] When it comes to rebuilding golgari midrange, is Kraul Whipcracker part of the answer?",spikes,1i01wsw,2025-01-12 19:51:15,36,0.93,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1i01wsw/standard_when_it_comes_to_rebuilding_golgari/,Livid_Jeweler612,Standard,"Howdy all,

I find it interesting that golgari's gone from being one of the best decks at worlds to basically a non-factor as of the last big standard tournament. The major threats e.g. glissa being terribly positioned for the bounce your thing/nowhere to run your thing dimir decks has rendered the most common build of the deck moot.

I've started messing around with alternatives, \[\[Kraul Whipcracker\]\] a decent enough uncommon from MKM seems oddly well positioned - a decent enough ETB and 3/2 reach body is very nice. Killing your opponent's otter token feels much better when you're not spending a full removal spell on it, the reach is great for blocking dimir's fliers and you're not nearly as bothered losing a 2 mana threat which already killed a thing to nowhere to run than you are if it does die to removal. It also kills everywhere lands vs domain control which is a tasty upside, loads of decks in the format run incidentally valuable tokens, the ETB is real imo.

I feel like a deck with these as part of the two drop slot, alongside \[\[preacher of the schism\]\] as a better 3 drop for the current gameplan has the beginnings of legs. It also makes me think \[\[The Swarmweaver\]\] is worth considering because Kraul whipcracker is an insect and while it dies to cutdown the flying bodies are a nice ""go wide"" plan and block well enough a lot of dimir threats. There's an argument for spinner of souls as well but its poorly sized and easy to bounce. \[\[Scrapshooter\]\] as a very nicely sized reach threat and ETB rec sage also worth considering imo.

What do people think? I don't think all the pieces are there right now but these options feel more capable of adapting to the current state of standard."
Darmacles “The Relentless & The Redeemed” (Communicant Fan Lore BackStory) Please Leave Feedback!! ,TrenchCrusade,1i016qg,2025-01-12 19:15:35,15,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i016qg,GamerBuffalo716_,Lore,"Darmacles Version 7


The Legend of Darmacles: The Relentless & Redeemed Communicant
 
Born In, and Of Devotion

Darmacles was born into the soot-choked streets of the Holy Dominion, a vast industrial wasteland where iron was forged for the Church Militant’s endless crusades. His father, a proud factory worker who toiled in the inferno of the forges, crafting weapons and armor, pounding iron for the Church Militant’s warriors It was said that his father’s work brought divine favor to those who bore the Church’s weapons into battle, that each victory was a blessing from the heavens. The Church Militant, more than an army, it was a manifestation of divine will, and its warriors, the chosen instruments of the Meta-Christ, a being created in the image of the Christ Redeemer. To the faithful, the Church's Militant were more than men; they were the divine instruments of God’s will. His father a proud devout man, would tell Darmacles tales of martyrs who died with faith on their lips, and of the the Meta-Christ, the clone of the Christ Redeemer whose sacrifice laid the foundation of the Church. Young Darmacles grew up with a heart burning for divine justice, his mind captivated by the sacred texts, especially the Sanguine Testament and the Creed of Eternity his faith burned brighter than the furnaces that surrounded him with the belief that divine justice would one day cleanse the world.

His childhood was marked by unrelenting toil, hardship, and the constant grind of labor Darmacles devotion, and faith never wavered his piety inspired all who knew him. It was his father’s tales of the Meta-Christ—the one who would lead them all in the final battle—and the Crusades martyrs that shaped his soul.
Darmacles memorized scripture, his fervor outpacing his peers. By twelve, he could recite entire passages of the sacred texts, and his devotion to the divine was unshakeable. Yet, despite his piety, a longing gnawed at him, Darmacles harbored a yearning far greater than mere piety: to fight—not just pray, to be more than a laborer for the Church like his father before him, but one of the Church's greatest champions, a living embodiment of divine wrath.

Destined For More Than Worship, and Labor

It was when the Mendellist monks of his monastery received a fragment of the Meta-Christ’s cloned flesh and blood of Christ the Redeemer.—an artifact of immeasurable holiness—that Darmacles knew his moment had arrived. He volunteered to partake in the Communion ritual, an initiation that few dared to endure, much less survive. Darmacles saw his opportunity. A sacred relic, the Meta-Christ's flesh was kept under constant guard in the monastery. The monks would conduct a Holy Communion on The Night of The Third Day the celebration of The Real Christ The Redeemer when God raised Jesus from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, feeding upon the relic’s divine essence to transform a chosen few into Communicants, mighty warriors imbued with the power of the Meta-Christ.

His youthful frame drew skeptical glances from the Mendellist monks. But Darmacles' faith, so pure and unshakeable, his convictions so fierce they were amazed at his piety at such a young age, they granted him with a chance to prove himself, the chance to undergo the agonizing ritual. At first, the monks laughed. How could a boy so young, so frail, survive the trial? But Darmacles knew that his faith would sustain him. He believed with all his being that he was destined for glory and that the Meta-Christ Himself had chosen him.

The Communion and Transformation

The Ritual began as the Mendellist monks began the ritualistic ceremony
a monk stood before them crying out saying ""The Meta-Christ did cut its flesh, and gave it to the disciples. When Its ruined mouth could not form the words, but it grunted noises, we translated its words"" Said the monk saying “Take, eat; this is my body.” And the Meta-Christ did leak blood from its eyes and mouth, which we the Mendellist monk caught in a chalice, again the Meta-Christ spoke"" preached the monk ""And once again we translated the Meta-Christ’s painful noises when he spoke again saying ""Drink ye all of it…” The communion commenced a morsel of flesh sat at the communion table on a glimmering polished gold plate next to it the Meta-Grail an embellished gold cup containing a small amount of the original Holy Grail itself that was melted down to create communion cups for communicant initiates the Communion nearly shattered him.

As the Meta-Christ’s flesh and blood coursed through his veins, his body twisted and grew beyond human limits. His muscles swelled like stone, his bones cracked, and his body grew to a towering, monstrous size. The pain was unimaginable, but he never flinched. His resolve was ironclad. The final act of the Communion was to pierce his eyes with holy crosses—rendering him blind to the world. In the agony, Darmacles did not scream. Instead, he laughed—a deep, powerful laugh that echoed within the monastery.

“I see clearer now,” he proclaimed, his voice filled with divine certainty. “For my vision lies in the will of the Meta-Christ.”

Darmacles emerged from the Communion a changed man. Unlike many who underwent communion, many Communicants were driven mad or filled with rage, he was calm and unyielding, the very picture of divine purpose. Darmacles did not lose his mind or descend into madness. His faith, unwavering in the face of divine transformation, held him steady. He emerged from the Communion Chamber whole, but irrevocably changed. His sightless gaze, his massive frame, and his unyielding faith made him a living symbol of the Church’s power and wrath. The very earth seemed to quake under his might, and his faith guided his every action. His hammer, inscribed with holy verses, became his weapon a token to his father, and the hammer he used crafting for the Church Militant in the City of Holy Domion as—a divine instrument of judgment, wielded in the service of the Meta-Christ he thought to himself..

The First Bloodshed

Darmacles's first battlefield was the blood-soaked Trenches of Gralic’s Maw—a wasteland of blood and fire where his faith and newfound power amidst the chaos of war, his divine transformation was put to the test. Armed with a colossal Warhammer inscribed with holy verses, Darmacles strode through smashing enemy lines, unstoppable a living embodiment of the Church's wrath. Heedless of musket fire and cannon fodder. Bullets and cannon fire pinged off his skin, his monstrous form unaffected by the violence around him. With each swing of his hammer, he pulverized his foes, his enemies turning to pulp beneath his blow baptizing his path. Witnesses spoke of his eerie silence during the battle; unlike other Communicants, who roared hymns and prayers in their fury, Darmacles fought in solemn determination, his lips moving as if reciting verses only he could hear. As the battle raged, and the Legion of Heretics finally broke, Darmacles stood amidst the carnage, his hands soaked in blood, his Warhammer dripping with them while he whispered a litany of redemption prayers over the fallen bodies, both friend and foe alike.

The Crusades and the Loss of His Arm

As the years passed, Legends began to swirl among the faithful and heretics alike those who encountered him spoke of his unyielding resolve, his ability to bring down entire squads with a single blow: Darmacles was not merely a Communicant but an avatar of the Meta-Christs judgment Darmacles became a living legend, a symbol of judgment and proof God still loved his faithful. The Prophets of New Antioch declared that when Darmacles fell, it would mark the Church’s greatest trial—a war not just against heresy but against darkness itself. Darmacles roamed the war-torn lands, his Warhammer in hand, his sightless gaze ever fixed on the horizon, seeking the next battlefield where his fury might serve the will of the Meta-Christ. Word of his actions spread throughout the Dominion. To the faithful, he was the chosen champion of the Church. To the heretics, he was a living nightmare, a harbinger of the end times. The monks deemed him unmeasurable success, in the Communion process. However, Abbot Kestrel, who oversaw the transformation, saw something else: a weapon unparalleled. He petitioned the Church Militant to allow Darmacles to serve, not as a standard Communicant but as a living scourge—a force unleashed.

He spoke only in scripture on the battlefield, twisting sacred verses into declarations of judgment upon the heretical and unclean. Darmacles soon earned his title ""The Relentless"" on the battlefield. When the Prophet Xavaron's vanguard was encircled by the abominations that was made up of the Court of the Seven Headed Serpent, it was Darmacles who broke their lines. Wielding his great Warhammer, he strode through their ranks

In the Siege of Ninefold Bastion, however, Darmacles faced a challenge even he could not overcome unscathed. A heretical war machine, a towering monstrosity of unholy design, a Desecrated Saint tore through Darmacles’s company. In the chaos of the battle, a blade of infernal fire severed Darmacles's left arm at the shoulder. The pain was unimaginable despite the grievous injury, he refused to retreat. Clutching his Warhammer in his right hand, Darmacles ""The Relentless"" fought for hours, turning the tide of battle and buying precious time for the Prophet-General to rally the Dominion’s forces. His valor turned the tide, but his arm did not regenerate as expected despite Darmacles’s divine essence it did not heal the severed limb. His body regenerated all other wounds, but his arm was gone forever. In the silence of the battlefield, the loss only deepened his resolve. When he heard a whisper ""What? know ye not that your body is the temple of that which is in you? which ye have of ate of? ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify the Meta-Christ in your body, and in your spirit"" After the words fainted as quickly as he heard them he spoke only these words: ""A missing arm is nothing when I wield the will of God.""

After the loss of his arm The Church Militant debated whether he should be sealed away like other failed Communicants, but his victories were too valuable to ignore. Instead, he was given a solitary role: Sent from battlefield to battlefield acting as a line-breaker and bodyguard for War Prophets and Castigators. Darmacles became the embodiment of divine wrath, a living reminder of the cost of heresy and the Church’s unyielding might.


The Anointed Shield: The Cross of Redemption

Though his body healed, Darmacles was left with a profound sense of loss of his arm. In that moment, however, Darmacles heard a voice unlike any he had ever heard, very different from the whisper before. It was the voice of the Meta-Christ speaking to him, His voice filled with power and steadfastness.

“Fear not, my child"" the voice said ""Your faith shall be your shield, and I shall not abandon you.”

Darmacles fell to his knees, clutching his Warhammer, and cried out in prayer.

""Lord, grant me strength. I fight not only for victory in battle, but for your glory.""

In that moment of divine intervention, A radiant holy figure appeared before him, an angelic vision glowing with divine light. The figure knelt beside him and placed upon his wounded back a shield unlike any seen before in the realm of men. —massive, forged of the finest wood, and emblazoned with a cross of immense power the symbol of Christ's sacrifice, nailed firmly to its center. The shield was anointed with holy oil and imbued with a divine power that would protect Darmacles this protection was derived straight from the Meta-Christ itself. It was not simply just a physical shield, but a divine armor, capable of protecting Darmacles from the forces of darkness and spiritual corruption.

In that moment, as the light faded and the figure vanished Darmacles felt strength flow into him like a river of life renewed. The pain and depression of his severed arm dulled, and his mind was filled with purpose. He rose from the ground, the shield now a part of him, inseparable; would be his greatest weapon paired with his Warhammer in the battle not only against flesh and blood but against the principalities and powers of darkness. The cross upon the shield was a constant reminder that his true fight was not for land or glory but for the Kingdom of Heaven, and the soul mission of being the Meta-Christ judgment on the battlefield. The infused Armor of Protection from the Meta-Christ a gift that would solidify his place as the Meta-Christ’s chosen champion from now until his last days.–a testament his faith would ALWAYS be his defense against the wiles of the heretic forces, as written in the scripture. Prepared for battle once more. Darmacles returned to the battle with his enemies, seeing the cross on the shield upon his back as a steadfast guardian. His enemies faltered. They knew the mighty warrior to be blessed by the Meta-Christ, and fear of divine retribution swept through their ranks. Darmacles became even more unstoppable than before, fighting with righteous fury and unyielding faith. The shield, though worn and battle-scarred, remained intact, its power never waning. In time, the shield came to be known as The Cross of Redemption, being given only after he lost his arm, and its power not for glory, but as a reminder of their calling to stand against the forces of darkness became a symbol of divine protection, a beacon for those who walked the path of truth and righteousness against the spiritual wickedness in high places.

A Life of Relentless Duty

His single arm wielded his great Warhammer his back carrying the massive anointed shield the Cross of Redemption with a strength no ordinary man could match, Darmacles became an unstoppable force on the battlefield fighting in hundreds of battles, and campaigns slaying every champion Hell sent his way he becoming a symbol of hope for the faithful and a nightmare for the heretics. Even blind, his divine connection guided him unerringly through the chaos of war. His enemies quailed before him, their spirits broken by the sight of his divine protection, and his unyielding spirit inspired countless others to follow him into the fray. As the years wore on his body, though invulnerable his flesh begain bearing the marks of countless campaigns, scars of battles, and the divine strain of his unending duty his wounds always fully healed, his faith always remained unbroken. But his mind begain to falter. He grew increasingly unstable, often lost in trance-like states where he muttered endless scripture, his once-miraculous healing slowing. Yet still, he pressed on, unwilling to rest until the enemies of the Church were eradicated and utterly annihilated . Off the battlefield, he would lapse into the same trances, his body rigid, his voice reciting more scripture. He mistook allies, and comrades for heretics and lashed out in fits of rage and fury from his blinded visions. Despite his successes on the battlefield, he began showing the marks of decay, as if his relentless spirit was slowly burning him from within.

Death and Immortality

Darmacles met his end In the final battle of his life, during the Final Siege of Marrow’s Crucible, an apocalyptic battle that claimed the lives of thousands. Surrounded and outnumbered, he fought until his body could no longer stand. Surrounded by enemies, he continued to smite down heretics with his Warhammer, slaying enemies with a single hand his faith always unyielding. His final act where Dramacles 'The Relentless"" fulfilled his communicant duties to the very end slaying what was said to be one hundred and eighty heretic troopers to make his way to shield a War Prophet from a heretic’s cannon blast, his massive frame absorbing the blow. silence fell upon the battle with anticipation of his return to the battle, yet his aging bodies regeneration could not keep up. When the battle ended, his body was found lifeless, his hammer still clutched tight in his right hand and the Cross of Redemption upon his back with his body recovered, The Church declared him a saint, His hammer, that was still clutched in his remaining hand, and the massive shield bestowed on him by the hands of the Meta-Christ was enshrined as a relics—and became objects of veneration.

The Eternal Relentless

Even in death, Darmacles’s name did not fade becoming the ""Legend of The Relentless"" a rallying cry for the faithful. He remains the embodiment of unwavering devotion and divine wrath, a reminder that faith and strength in the Meta-Christ can conquer all. Soldiers in the trenches speak of a shadowy figure appearing in the heat of battle, a one-armed giant who smashes through enemy lines and disappears before anyone can approach. A massive crossed shield of divine protection protecting War Prophets, Castigators, and Trench Pilgrims alike as if he stood before like once before. The faithful whisper that when the Church Militant faces its darkest hour, Darmacles will rise again, called back by the Meta-Christ Himself as the ultimate weapon against Hells forces. For now, his name echoes across the Dominion as a reminder of what it means to be truly relentless and proof of the Meta-Christs redemption—a servant of divine will who defies all odds, even death, to carry out the Meta-Christs plan. Darmacles, The Relentless, lives on in the hearts of those who walk the path of righteousness, a symbol of redemption, hope, and unyielding purpose during the remaing wars.

The Human Lesson,HFY,1hz745h,2025-01-11 17:02:12,88,0.98,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hz745h/the_human_lesson/,scienceandjustice,OC,"*Oh, cool,* an incredibly crass corner of Zinash Zewde’s mind thought as her mining ship, the *Oasis*, lurched; *I’ma be famous--the first casualty of the human/virkathi war!* The character on her screen died due to her moment of distraction, reminding her of when she was taught the concept of “foreshadowing” as a schoolgirl.

As she turned off the video game she’d been using to wile away the hours between Ceres and her claim, an even more crass corner of her mind retorted to the first: *Don’t be absurd--after the virkathi grind our bones into fertilizer they’ll pretend we never existed.*

She checked her computer in the vague hope that she was mistaken---that that violent forward jerking was something other than a tractor beam locking on to her--but no such luck. *Damn it, why me?*

That…was a good question, actually; *why* her? For days the “pirate” ship no one actually believed were real pirates--they were privateers *at best*\--had been content to set up its own satellite system around the outer system in order to sell the fiction that they weren’t plugged into the Virkath Hegemony’s network, and now that their plausible deniability was firmly established their first hostile act was to attack a one-woman mining ship?

*I guess the captain wants to get a few warm up exercises in before he starts harassing us proper. Cautious fellow.* She began to look at another reading, then paused halfway through moving her hand to bring it up as she realized something that brought that assumption into question--she had, or appeared to have, complete control of her ship still.

She ran through her systems as fast as she could and unless the “pirates” were spoofing her systems, she did indeed have full control, at least insofar as she could tell from the pilot’s seat. *The absolute, arrogant flex!*

*…Wait.* That would seem to contradict her earlier assessment that the “pirate” captain was cautious.

For that matter, why was this taking so long? Even if the “pirates” wanted to keep her alive for some reason, they could accelerate her faster than this--it felt like they were deliberately drawing out the moment of her capture for as long as they could.

Oh. The pieces clicked together. The slow capture, the lack of any sort of jamming whatsoever--so that there would be a crystal clear record of what happened here today--and their choice of target--starting as small as they could so that continuously escalate for as long as possible. They were drip-feeding the horror. This was propaganda. No doubt they’d love it if she were to cry out, begging for someone to help her or for them to have mercy.

*Fuck that shit; I’ma die wth dignity.*

Hopefully, it wouldn’t come to that; she took assessments of her resources, both in her computer’s inventory and in her mental inventory, took a few more readings, and concluded that there was fuck-all she could do.

*I wonder what’ll happen if I fire my engine?* One of two things: either nothing, or--if it looked like it was doing her *any* good at all--the “pirates” would decide she didn’t have engine privileges anymore.

Zinash sighed. She should hold off on that as long as possible; maybe if she fired at the last second, she’d do some sort of damage to their ship…wait.

She noticed something she should have noticed right away just from the direction of acceleration--the *Oasis* was being dragged by the nozzle.

Another flex? Perhaps. But then again, from what she knew of Hegemony society (which was quite a bit, actually; aliens were not yet so old hat that the human public as a whole wasn’t devouring every last scrap of information they could get about them), it was highly regimented and caste-based. In school, the captain of the alien ship (a retrofitted Honv-753 passenger ship--much like the one her character had just died in, ironically enough) would have been taught what he’d have needed to know to be a good naval officer in *modern* warfare--and ubiquitous reactionless drives meant modern warfare in the rest of the galaxy didn’t involve anything as primitive, clunky, slow, and energy-intensive as rockets.

*Hot damn; there’s hope, after all.* Not of survival, of course--Zinash wasn’t *that* much of a wide-eyed optimist--but of taking at least some of these bastards down with her. All she had to do was wait for the right moment to spring her trap…

*…Only that’s not entirely true, is it?* If the goal here was to sell her life as dearly as she could, that wasn’t a metric that could be weighed entirely in how many of the “pirates” she took with her. The far more valuable metric was time--if she could give the Virkath Hegemony enough pause to delay their inevitable invasion of Sol by a single day, that was one more day of life and freedom for tens of billions of people--sixty million man-years, collectively--and she intended to buy far more than a single day. How much she could actually get, she had no idea, but she intended to take as much as she could--and to achieve that, she had to do a little propaganda of her own.

Zinash put on her space suit--not that she expected to get much use out of it, but she was *not* going to hail them in her underwear, and besides, doing the checks gave her a chance to collect herself. She put on her game face; she hadn’t acted since high school drama club, and this was going to be the performance of a lifetime.

*You realize, of course, that if this* is *a flex on their part, you’ll not only have that to deal with, but you’ll look stupid.* 

This particular treacherous voice was easy enough to answer: *I’ll be too dead to care regardless.*

Quashing her doubt, Zinash hailed the “pirates.” The bridge of the alien ship appeared on her screen. The virkathi said nothing--waiting for her to plead for her life, no doubt.

“So, how may I be of service to the Virkath Hegemony today?” she asked lackadaisically.

The captain, seemingly unfazed by her fluency in High Virkath, cleared his throat. “This is Captain Tois of the pirate ship--”

“Bitch, please--if you stupid fucks were allowed to open a history book every now and then, you’d know that this whole overly-precious operation of yours *stinks* of proxy conflict. Literally no one in Sol is fooled. Of course, it’s little wonder that your masters don’t let you, since then you’d also know that it’s people like you who get it in the neck when these things go south.”

Tois seemed unphased by this, which could mean nothing. “You realize I only accepted your hail in order to hear you beg for your life, right? Make it good and I *might* consider it.”

Zinash scoffed. “If I *actually* believed I was going to lose here, I wouldn’t give you the satisfaction.”

This did throw him a bit. “What the actual fuck do you mean, ‘if’? You’re an ant challenging an elephant!”

“I never suspected alien space pirates would be familiar enough with Earth’s biosphere to know what an ant is,” Zinash mocked.

“I read up on your star system before coming here,” Tois said with a calculated boredom--he couldn’t afford to look like he was too interested in distancing himself from the idea that he was affiliated with the Hegemony, after all.

“Don’t bother denying it. We have a long history of exactly the kind of proxy conflict the Hegemony is trying to pull here. Even if you’re an actual pirate and not a ‘retired’ naval officer or spy moonlighting as one, that only means that the Hegemony leaned on a criminal syndicate it owns in order to create another layer of obfuscation between itself and this operation. Either you provoke us into doing something your propagandists can spin into an attack on the Hegemony, or we do nothing and the problem of pirates operating out of Sol gets so bad that you have ‘no choice’ but to come in and clear them out yourselves, since we can’t or won’t.”

“Far be it for me to attempt to dissuade you from these conspiracy theories you’re spinning for yourself--but aren’t you taking this awfully casually, then?”

“That’s because I’m about to turn this whole encounter around and spank you so thoroughly and humiliatingly that no one is going to want to follow in your footsteps for a long, long time.”

“Oh? *Do* enlighten me,” Tois mocked.

“Tell me, when you were ‘reading up’ on Sol system, did the concept of science fiction ever come up?”

“I am aware of the fact that a bunch of you like to do a bunch of wild-ass speculation about the future without even the benefit of a background in your primitive sciences, yes,” Tois said.

Zinash laughed. “Yeah, you *wouldn’t* see much value in the concept, would you? Well, once upon a time there was a science fiction writer named Larry Niven, who did his most prominent work during the eleven-nine-sixties and eleven-nine-seventies.”

“So his ideas about science will have been several centuries more out-of-date than even your own. I’d call this a stalling tactic, if there was anything you could plausibly be stalling *for*.”

Zinash ignored his quip. “In a short story called *The Warriors*, Niven introduced a species of fictional aliens called the Kzinti. It’s later revealed that the Kzinti were technologically uplifted directly from the iron age to the reactionless drive age by another species called the Jotoki, and I presume this was in part a retroactive justification for why the trick the humans used to win the battle in *The Warriors*, which has been known in real life ever since as the Kzinti Lesson, worked--presumably it never occurred to Niven that a species would just not teach its soldiers basic science, after all.”

“Is there a rest stop between here and the fucking point? What could you *possibly* think you can do to us with an unarmed rocket ship?” Tois demanded.

“Ah, but you see, that *is* the Kzinti lesson,” Zinash said, grinning triumphantly as she activated her ship’s main engine, which was pointed directly at the center of mass of Tois’ ship at point blank range. “*There’s no such thing as an ‘unarmed’ rocket ship!*”

Zinash fully expected the sudden acceleration to render her into chunky salsa, but there was no acceleration as the tractor beam held; this presumably meant that the pirate ship was feeling the full force of her exhaust, but Newton went out the window when you were dealing with reactionless drives, so who could say for sure? Given the unexpected opportunity to save herself, she decoupled the cabin of her ship from the body. 

“Plug that nozzle with the shields,” Tois ordered one of his crewmen, not bothering to end the call before doing so.

As Zinash drifted she watched her ship turn around and its exhaust suddenly die out. She then bounced off of nothing, her cabin being stuck between two layers of shields.

Tois turned towards the screen. “Really? *That* was your big gambit? Light a fire on my hull?”

“To be fair, if it *had* worked, those would have been some *killer* final words,” she said, checking her engine readings as she did so.

“It’s not too late to beg for your life, you know,” Tois said, some of his irritation at her apparent nonchalance slipping through.

Zinash, knowing that she needed to distract him lest he notice what she had, decided to continue mocking him.

“Hey, remind me--what kind of ship am I flying, again?”

“Don’t fucking pretend that this was *also* part of your plan--”

“Of course not, but that’s the great thing about actually *understanding* the science your ship is built on--it means you can improvise. For instance, let’s say that you attacked someone with the exhaust of a nuclear salt water rocket, which is also known as a ‘Zubrin drive’ after an early proponent, and *also* also known as a ‘flying Chernobyl’ for historical reasons I’m sure *you* don’t care *anything* about.” She paused to ensure she timed this line correctly, covering the wait by clearing her throat. 

“Captain…” a crewman said, presumably noticing what Zinash was trying to distract Tois from.

She concluded: “And now let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that, in his *infinite* wisdom, your enemy’s solution to this problem was to *put a cork* in a *runaway fission chain reaction*.”

And with that, her ship exploded. As expected there was at least one layer of shield between her and her ship, and between that and blind luck, the explosion missed her. Her electronics flickered out for a second, then came back on. Her computer found Tois’ ship again, and--

*No way. Are their electronics* seriously *not hardened against EMPs? I refuse to believe that!* She didn’t care how outdated the tech was in the wider galaxy, surely any warship--

Ah, but that was the thing: this was a *pirate* ship, and one retrofitted from a *civilian* ship at that. No doubt a proper Hegemony warship would laugh at anything her quaint little nuclear bomb could dish out, but the original builders, and even the retrofitters, would have had different priorities and different cost-benefit analyses.

Only, she kind of doubted it’d be that easy. Tois’ poor judgement throughout this encounter was due to a cultural blindspot--not genuine stupidity on the part of the virkath species as a whole. More intellectual castes would have looked over the plans for this operation, studied the kinds of threats Tois was likely to face here, and made sure he was prepared to face them. And while those people might see the risk of an EMP blast as being low enough to opt for a cheap fix over the expense of completely tearing out and redoing the ship’s wiring, there was no way they’d have nothing at all.

Meaning it was only a matter of time before Tois got his ship back up and running, and she imagined he was pissed off enough to use his weapons on her when he did.

Zinash put on her helmet, grabbed her spare space suit for extra oxygen and propulsion unit fuel, and left without cycling the airlock, using the blast of air to create distance between herself and what remained of her ship. It wouldn’t take Tois long to figure that one out, though, and there was only one place she could hide.

She flew towards Tois’ ship.

The explosion had opened a breach in the hull wide enough for her to enter, though she could feel the heat radiating off of the jagged metal as she passed through the tear. And no doubt that wasn’t the worst of what it was radiating; she was going to need a full medical work-over after bathing in her own fallout like this.

She was in a section of hall that--proving the *builders* of this ship knew what they were doing at least--ended abruptly in bulkheads a little ways beyond the damaged section in either direction. One of these bulkheads came after a turn in the corridor and, choosing this as her hiding place on the grounds that it hid her from any other direction enemies might come from, she pressed herself against the ceiling.

If they managed to get the gravity back on, she’d be looking at a four meter drop directly onto her face, an unenviable position from which to take on the entirety of the ship’s security forces, but the original builders of the ship had assumed there would always be gravity and positioned their security cameras accordingly. Of course, a giant corridor of blind spot running throughout the ship was *far* too obvious a weakness to hope the retrofitters would miss or choose to ignore, but Zinash could hope their fix wasn’t so thorough as to completely eliminate it--she had first-hand evidence that they’d cheaped out in other areas, after all.

There was a sudden, bright flash of light from outside the ship, that was blinding even after having had to bounce off of two walls after getting in through a narrow gap to reach her; Tois had decided to nuke her back, it seemed.

*Alright. I’ve cheated death for the third time in as many minutes.* Now *what am I gonna do?*

The plan she came up with was desperate, audacious, and hinged entirely on the assumption that the designers of her favorite video game weren’t just wildly pulling nonsense out of their asses when depicting the interiors of Hegemony ships. But hell--audacity and desperation had done wonders for her this day. And unlike her other plans this day, *this* one she had a realistic chance of surviving.

*So* of course *this is going to be where I die,* she thought sardonically.

Still, though--she’d set out to sell her life dearly, and come what may, she had done marvelously in that department.

The lights came on in the hall, but not the gravity. Not entirely surprising--from what Zinash understood, artificial gravity and tractor beams were two different applications of the same basic process, and she was sure she had overloaded Tois’ tractor beam. Air was also filling the corridor, so she was sure that soldiers--oh, sorry, *pirates*\--would be along shortly to begin repairing the hull.

And lo, the bulkhead began to open. Two virkathi entered the corridor and--displaying their lack of experience in zero g combat--didn’t even *look* up. Displaying their lack of zero g experience in general, they were unable to account for the inertia of the hull plates they were carrying and let them slam into the far wall. And then--casually, as though they were unaware of how close the virkath in front had come to crushing himself to death--each one turned on a plasma torch the size and approximate shape of a lance and began cutting away at the wall around the breach.

She kicked off of the ceiling, crossing her arms to absorb the impact, and launched herself into one. He fell forward, onto the handle of his tool, winding him. She grabbed him and used him to reorient herself, launching herself at his companion feet-first. He held his torch in both hands in front of him, trying to block her with it but just giving her something to grab and pivot herself around so that she could kick him in the face. She then wrested the torch out of the his hands and used it to stab the first virkath in the front right foot.

He screamed and passed out. He’d live; the torch had instantly cauterized the stump where his foot had been. But the other virkath lost his courage at the sight or sound or possibly smell of this and fled. Zinash picked up the torch he’d dropped and turned it off.

As she coasted through the corridors to her destination, she reflected on the fight. The virkathi outmassed her fivefold, had half again her reach, superior strength unless they’d been *really* slacking off at the gym, and had outnumbered her two to one; she’d like to think that a human in their position would have at least *tried* to use the plasma torch offensively. But it seemed she had been the beneficiary of the aliens’ caste system yet again--the stark psychological difference between workers and warriors naturally created an equally stark psychological difference between the tools of their trades; a plasma torch wasn’t a *weapon*, it was a *tool*\--the fact that it was presumably powerful enough to weld hull plating was irrelevant.

Zinash was careful to avoid the places where she’d have put additional cams if she were the one to retrofit the ship, but apparently managed to run afoul of one anyway because suddenly three soldiers were converging on her with plasma rifles drawn.

*Let’s hope this works…* “I surrender!”

The lone soldier coming up on her from the rear blinked incredulously. “And why should we let you?” he asked.

“I haven’t killed anyone--” *yet* “--and I’m unarmed.” Somehow, Zinash managed to say this with a straight face while having one plasma torch strapped to her back and holding another in both hands above her head. She got into a “seated” position on what was intended to be the floor that made her look small and nonthreatening but would allow her to kick off of it whenever she wanted.

The speaker, suffering from the same exact cultural blindness as the engineers, made an affirmative gesture to the two coming from the other direction, who then approached incautiously.

Zinash turned the torch on and jumped forward, skewering them both on it; the only reason it didn’t go clean through them were the handles that jutted out of the rear portion of it. The living one was firing at her instantly, but his expertise also didn’t extend to zero g, and so was surprised by her movements as she ricocheted between the corpses and the wall to reach the only cover she had. Her first shot with the plasma rifle she picked up along the way was to destroy the hot end of the torch, so that it wouldn’t hurt her.

She then laid down covering fire. Her shots were wild, but it wasn’t a risk he could afford to take; like it or not, he’d have to take the only cover available to *him* and get up close to the other side of the corpses.

Zinash didn’t check to see if he were in the position she hoped to corral him into--he was certain to be good enough to whoop her amateur ass dead if she did something as careless as expose part of her head--before switching to firing up the length of the torch. In three shots she’d destroyed the length of the thing and, more importantly, ruptured the battery, releasing all the energy it contained (which, again, was enough to weld starship armor) at once, in a phenomenon experts refer to as an “explosion.”

Zinash was buffered by the two bodies between her and the explosion, and rode the shockwave. Some quick scurrying put them between her and the abrupt end of the hall, cushioning her landing, and she bounded off down one of the arms of the T-shaped intersection; the whole ship knew where she was now, but luckily she was at her destination.

She tied the rifle to her hip and kicked off the corpses to soar down the final hallway. The door to the engine room was sealed, but there was no bulkhead here; her remaining torch made quick work of the hinges and latch.

“Hey! You can’t--”

Zinash ignored the virkath--chief engineer, according to uniform and rank insignia--to fly around back of the engine core.

“Don’t ignore--*holy fuck what are you doing???*” his anger turned to terror as she began cutting away at the core’s insulation.

“Call captain Tois,” Zinash ordered in an upper caste register, waving the torch at him threateningly before getting back to work.

The chief engineer froze for a moment as the lifetime of conditioning to obey a voice that used that kind of language warred with the--well, the *everything* about this situation. He ended up calling the captain, not so much because she had told him to but because it seemed like a good idea in and of itself.

Zinash switched to the plasma rifle; honestly she’d have preferred to continue wielding the torch--and not just because there was a nonzero chance the rifle had caught some of the blowback of that explosion back there--but there was the intimidation factor to consider.

“What in the name of whatever primitive gods you worship do you think you’re doing, human?” Tois demanded over the intercom.

“Alright, I’ma need you to actually listen for this one, Tois, because you have a choice to make: are we doing this the easy way, or the hard way? The *easy* way is where I breach the core and blow us all to whatever primitive hells *you* believe in. The *hard* way is where you fly to Ceres and surrender to the authorities there.”

“And say I choose to flood engineering with plasma instead?” Tois asked.

“Nice try, but this isn’t a warship where you can just override the safety systems on a whim. Whatever bypasses you *can* do in this thing, you need *him*\--” Zinash gestured at the chief engineer “--for, and do forgive me for impugning his honor as a loyal son of Virk, but *I* don’t think he’s feeling particularly suicidal today.”

Tois made a noise that signaled resignation to defeat. “It’ll take an hour--”

“It’ll take fifteen *unk* for your ship to reach Ceres from here, being mindful of the damage I’ve already done; if I don’t see a human in front of me in twenty, I’m blowing up the ship. The same goes for if I *do* see, hear, smell, or electroreceptorally sense--” she added just to keep them on their toes “--a single virkath. Other than the chief here, of course; *he* stays *exactly* where I can see him.”

“I’m not going to stand here and pretend that Zinash Zewde didn’t have luck on her side,” Lyeess said--nay, orated--rubbing a tentacle in a gesture of demurment, as though they were being generous in making this allowance, “but as the old saying goes--both here and on Earth, appropriately enough--fortune favors the prepared, and the humans have been preparing as best as they could against the Virkath Hegemony. The heavy emphasis on Earth’s colonial and neocolonial periods in their history education is no doubt a large reason they haven’t had a color revolution yet, and their decision to make the information we’ve given them about Hegemony ships--” all of it in the public domain in the wider galaxy, so that the virkathi had no legal leg to stand on when they inevitably complained about it “--openly available to the public and indeed actively encourage media to accurately portray them…well, we can all see from the recordings how effective *that* was. Not that I think the humans were planning on precisely this to happen, of course, but they knew it would be useful for the general populace to have a general understanding of how Hegemony ships work, in the event of an invasion. And while it was lucky for Zinash Zewde that *Raiders from Proxima Centauri* almost perfectly predicted how Tois’ Honv-753 was retrofitted--that only goes to show the degree to which humans understand and can predict the virkath mind.

“We have heretofore offered little more than token help to the humans--they are very far away from us and there is only so much we can justify investing in annoying the virkathi, after all. But the humans have proven that they have the potential to be far more than a mere speedbump to the Hegemony’s expansion--they can be a true hurdle, perhaps even a legitimate ally in time, and we can squeeze the virkathi between us. So perhaps it’s time for us to do more.

“I’m not asking for much. Not for us to start treaty negotiations or guarantee their existence or anything like that…computer, end recording; this speech sucks,” Lyees abruptly ended.

“I thought it was going pretty decently; bit awkward towards the beginning, though,” Ahmed Mihret commented. He also found it stuffy, but assumed that that part was intentional.

Lyees was one of the observers the Iri Confederation sent to Sol to, essentially, be a thorn in the side of the Virkath Hegemony in its expansionism, and during their time here had decided that they actually liked humanity. Looking at their human friend, they said, “I just…they’re going to ask how we can predict/control--” the word was the same in Lyees’ language “--you. I just *know* they are.”

“Tell them the truth. That we understand how great power politics work, and won’t hold it against them unless they try to subvert our sovereignty and/or turn us into a proxy to fight their wars for them,” Ahmed said.

Lyees slumped in their species’ equivalent of a sigh. “*That’s* the problem,” they confessed. “If I do my job correctly--they’ll *absolutely* want to shape you into an attack ‘dog’--” the word was ill-fitting in their speech spiracles “--against the Hegemony.”

Ahmed considered; he was considering just how much Lyees had gone native, mainly. “There are other powers out there besides the Hegemony and the Confederation, right?” He knew their names, but little more than that; humanity’s knowledge of the wider galaxy came mainly from people like Lyees. “Once the story spreads to them, they’ll surely want to check us out themselves. With all the options for, ah, patronage that’ll bring, they’ll have no choice but to respect our wishes.”

Ahmed could feel the gears turning in Lyees’ head. “Hmm. You’re right; I’m going about this all wrong. The media campaign is the thing…” and with that they began muttering to themself too softly for him to hear and pacing.

He smiled; they’d be at that for a while. In the meantime, he queued up Zinash Zewde’s latest interview on his phone."

# Aboard the Robin Williams:

Admiral Jock watched as red icons flickered to yellow and gray by the dozens as they came into range of just one of his ships.  The Axxaakk had built new ships since the outbreak of hostilities, they were generally comparable in size to a heavy cruiser, or maybe a light battleship, and they were admittedly powerful.  His destroyers couldn't stand up to focused fire from two of those ships for long, and they were outnumbered at about twenty to one.  However, they were lumbering beasts, and the destroyers of Second Star Rapid Response Group was highly mobile.  Even pressed up against a planet, his skippers could maneuver in surprising ways.  Well, not the skippers, but the helmsmen, to tell the truth, but it takes more than a steady hand and a clear mind to command such a vessel under action.  His officers had what it took in spades and buckets.

It wasn't enough though.  He watched the *James T* wink to yellow, and the *Rufio* and the *Tinker Bell* too.  Storied ships with decades of service mission killed.  The icon of the newly built and commissioned *Mister Smee* was a whirl of fury, the last ship who had carried that name went down with all hands.  It was almost as if she was posessed by spirits of vengance as she tumbled through the tight knot of enemy red, and despite the display not showing weapons fire, Admiral Jock got the distinct impression that the enemy was having an especially hard time getting weapons on target with her.  The *Nibs* was in an orbital trajectory, and so wasn't under her own power, but she kept flashing from yellow to blue, likely indicating that she was still firing despite having lost engines.  The *Curley* and the *Tootles* were fighting their way toward her, and neither one was bothering to take evasive action.  They opted instead to send a wall of tungsten ahead of them toward the enemy squadron looking to put a kill shot into their sister ship.

In the future, this would be used to teach how to run a contested drop in the Naval Academy, and how to savage the enemy so fiercely he forgot how to think in the precious hours after making the drop.  Analysts would call it flawless, maybe even genius, officers would attempt to replicate it with smaller formations, it would be named something silly like the Nelson Drill.  They'd probably award him awards and medals for not only the plan's conception, but his steady and allegedly unflappable leadership through its harrowing implementation.  After all, he had put the flagship at the tip of the spear, and while the Republican Navy didn't exactly discourage personal valor in her flag officers, they were meant to at least keep out of direct line of fire.  That act was a show of confidence and courage, and academic types would read all sorts of psychological mumbo-jumbo leadership qualities into it.  All of that was irrelevant to Admiral Jock.  He had good men in danger because he'd ordered them into it, and some of them had already died.  More were going to die.  He was obliged to witness them.

All the while, the four-point enspherement formation of Admiral Ross crept closer to the enemy flanks.  If the enemy commander had any brains he'd be ordering all ships to scatter at full power and write off the ships that Admiral Jock's destroyers sunk as a result as unavoidable.  Well, maybe the enemy commander had more pride than brains.  Just another three hours and the trap would snap shut.

Thank God that there hadn't been a lost with all hands yet.  That wasn't to say that good voidsmen hadn't been killed when their ships were disabled, but fewer funerals for his men was always a good thing.

# Aboard the Tiger Lily:

""Sir, the shiprats want to climb in the tube,"" Lieutenant Commander Sarah Thomson said.

Captain Roberts narrowed his eyes at his tactical readout.  There was a battleship in his area of responsibility that would take a while to crack.  ""Tell them to strap into boarding torpedoes.  Their orders are to seize control of the vessel they board and turn its guns upon the enemy if possible.  If not, they are to render it useless and signal for pickup.""

""Aye sir,"" she responded before snapping off the appropriate orders.

The *Tiger Lily* braked and threw her bridge crew against their safety straps and then pressed them into their seats as Ensign Anderson stopped her nose short of crashing into what was once an enemy cruiser's engines, and lifted her aft into a vertical spin to take evasive action.

""Parker,"" Captain Roberts ordered briskly, ""Ramirez will need targets on this vessel here.  Ramirez, make sure the shiprats don't splatter on shields.""

""Aye, sir,"" they acknowledged together.

They had an entire platoon of RNI shipboard troopers to utilize.  They might as well be useful since they weren't being held in reserve for ground operations.  Third Fleet brought the reinforcements for that, but then again, if they didn't hurry, General George would finish before the first drop pass.  Besides, they'd complain if they went for another entire battle just waiting on high alert.

# Aboard the Jupiter's Might:

It had been long since Fleet Admiral Lucius Maximus Decimus had been made to deal with Republicans of any stripe.  Frankly speaking, he would have preferred not to, as they had an irritating tendency toward informality.  In this circumstance, however, he was bound by honor.  The very blood of the Eternal Emperor was in this battle, even if said blood had no care for the throne of Roma Nova.  This alone would have ensured that he should hold his command tightly in reign.  However, the woman known as The Saw had sent him a final communication.  ""Again,"" he said in a voice as soft as the hammer on anvil.

""She wishes you to know that should we allow a single enemy to escape, she shall consider it a personal insult,"" High Priestess Valeria Iunia repeated solemnly.

Fleet Admiral Lucius Maximus Decimus narrowed his eyes.  What to say to that?  He could not leave the words unanswered in view of his command, but on the other hand The Saw had every right to state her expectations.  However, the manner in which she did carried implications on not only his command, but the character of Roma Nova as a whole.  ""Our answer shall be our deeds,"" he said slowly, ""let her look on our works and judge for herself whether insult is offered.""

Pontifex Maximus Quintus Verus nodded on grave approval as the holographic display about the mosaic depicting Jupiter casting a thunderbolt flickered to life.  ""As to that,"" he said, ""the enemy does come in force to relieve what The Saw has trapped.

Fleet Admiral Lucius Maximus Decimus showed his teeth, ""They only outnumber us five to one.  Let us show them the folly of such odds.""

In the void some good one-hundred twenty light minutes or so away, squadrons began to form up the front line, and at a set of some very direct order did not go charging forward for honor and glory.  Instead they formed defensive blocks along the system's plane and mainly focused on interdicting the force translating into the system from hyperspace.  Republicans often would say that Roma Nova could punch well above their weight, but that was the opinion of a military that could and would employ overwhelming force to solve problems.  Roma Nova had to husband their strength and strike with cunning.

The vanguard was more veteran than the reserve, but only because the reserve had joined the conflict green, and more veteran than both was a smaller force of elite vessels whose crews waited behind the lines to stop any potential enemy breakthrough, reinforce flagging squadrons, or deliver a killing blow to a stubbornly resistant enemy formation.  The Axxaak obligingly met the Roman staggered block formation with a solid line formation.  This was a mistake.

# Aboard the Trafalgar:

""Do we have an update from our courier force yet?"" Admiral Ross asked as she glared at a blank spot on the holographic display.

""Running late,"" Ops. said. ""Apparantly they had a convoy of shipping to sink before they could head out to the drop off location.""

""I asked for an update, not why they weren't there two weeks ago.""

""Aye, ma'am.  Lord Admiral Brixdron sent his regards and an ETA that works out to…"" the officer seemed to run a quick calculation here, ""about ninety minutes from now.""

""Their superweapon will come in there,"" Admiral Ross said, pointing to the shadow of one of the system's two gas giants, and try to hit the largest targets while we're busy trying to ensphere the main fleet.  Tell our escorts to keep an eye out for translation in that general area, and I want ships in the battleship to light cruiser range to have a salvo ready for if it shows up.""

""Aye, ma'am.""

There was a hope that Lord Admiral Brixdron would arrive before the superweapon.  Apparently it had been driven off again when it looked like it was going to lose more than ten percent of its ships by engaging with a task force, but there was no telling how close the thing had been lurking.  Admiral Ross thought that the enemy had a sense that this was coming, not this exact assault, but that the Republic was aiming for its command and control center.  Of course, the Axxaakk might have only realized that once the Republic started shoving them off of their conquest for what might have been the first time in their entire recorded history.  She pitied a civilization that had only victories in their records.

Regardless of what the enemy were up to, Admiral Ross knew that there were no finer voidsmen than the Star Sailors, as much as it galled her to admit it.  The Second Star Rapid Response Group came close, but only close, and that only because of the incredibly high standards for helmsmen's combat maneuver scores to even be considered for that posting.  The Star Sailors on the other hand *lived* in between the stars for their whole lives, and they understood their ships the way only folks who understand their homes can.  Lord Admiral Brixdron could make it.  She might be able to set a slave free instead of being forced to kill it.

A few red icons blinked to green and her eyes went ever so slightly wider.  ""Really?  You authorized boarding torpedoes while you were pinned against the planet?  Jock, you wily son of a bitch, I bet you have the enemy commanders foaming at the mouth.""

Admiral Bingaman Hughes commented from his station, ""I think I may owe the man an apology.""

""I did tell you so.""

""Aye, ma'am.""

Admiral Ross allowed herself a brief moment of grave satisfaction as the carrier groups achieved flanking positions at the four major points, and swarms of tiny blue dots began streaking toward the enemy's fringes.  Admiral Jock could disengage now, and the order of battle wouldn't be likely to change.  Admiral Ross knew the man by reputation, though.  He wouldn't quit the field so long as a single Republican vessel was under threat.

Approximately twenty-three minutes later, red icons began to blink to yellow and gray in a rapidly contracting wave.  Rapidly, in terms of naval combat, anyway.  She estimated that if the enemy failed to surrender, it would be totally destroyed or disabled in approximately thirty-seven hours.  Within parameters.  She'd ordered her officers to pound on every last enemy vessel until one of those three outcomes was achieved.  It really never occurred to her that such an attitude might be how she got the nickname ""The Saw.""

# Aboard the Among the Star Tides We Rage:

M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was quite frankly, terrified.  His already brief digital life had been shortened once already, and though the repaired code did not hamper his cognition, it had been a painful experience.  Worse, he was going to do something with a very high likelihood of him taking code injuries again.  Not quite so chancy as holding a sinking ship together via reconfiguring the remaining battle screens into a force field and nearly slagging the hardware he was in to do it, but still pretty risky.  He found himself wishing he'd found another Digitan to batch with.  Sure, he was injured, but his core personality strings were still good.

""Marvin,"" M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l heard from… wait… no, no, no, ah.  The card room.  Or what the crew used for a card room at any rate.

""What's up, Brix?"" M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l asked through some cleverly placed speakers as he turned his attention to said room.  Now, he'd been working on an avatar.  Organics liked it when you had a face.  So, if he could just find the node for the holotable… he was never too great with three dimensional displays, but there weren't any good screens available.

To his credit, Lord Admiral Brixdron Dronva didn't seem all that awkward in the way he picked out a camera to look at as he asked, ""Are you certain that you wish to do this?  Other of your brethren have volunteered to accompany the Vengeful Vanguard, and one more or less is not likely to alter the outcome of the mission.""

""Aye, I'm sure this is my wish,"" The Star Sailors almost never used ""yes,"" even in their own language where there is a clear difference between ""aye"" and ""yes.""  M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l found that little things like that made him feel at home.  He found himself wishing he hadn't spent so long hiding in a factory dirtside and joined a MH approved ship for life after service instead.

""I have never had the pleasure to work with such a fine executive officer as you, Marvin,"" Lord Admiral Brexdron said seriously.  The man was actually secretly quite jovial, when his shipmates could catch those fleeting moments when the war was distant and friendship was close were some of M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l's favorite memory logs, but this seriousness was more than the weight of duty.

""Thanks, Brix,"" M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l chirped cheerfully.  Or, at least he told the speakers to make his voice sound chirpy and cheerful.  The Lord Admiral wasn't fooled, ""but I'm not changing my mind.""

""We will be arriving to the field of battle shortly,"" he said, still looking at the camera steadily, you shall get into a transit case, and I shall be commanding upon the bridge.  We shall not be able to speak again until after victory is achieved.""

""Aye, Brix.  I know that.""

""And though I do not understand how such things are done, I have been reliably informed that this digital assault is likely to be the deadliest front of the battle.""

""Aye.""

""Thus, I may never have the privilege of speaking to my cherished and courageous friend ever again.  I wanted to tell you some things.  First, scorch you for switching my hot and cold water,"" M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l loved Lord Admiral Brexdron's hiding a grin face.  Really, with just the two of them here he didn't need to maintain decorum, especially when talking about pranks.

""You were getting too mopey, sir.  Bad for morale.""

""Sure,"" he said with a pretense at suspicion.  ""That wasn't all.  I wanted you to know that it has been a pleasure and an honor to have you in this command, and of all those who rallied to my flag I shall cherish your friendship above all honors and awards my people may convey.""  M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was suddenly very glad that he was physically incapable of crying.  Really, it was totally unfair of the man to start saying such nice things like this.  ""Finally, if I do not see you again, witnessed.""

The Lord Admiral was almost a Terran the way he understood things.  ""Thank you, sir.  I'll do my best to return, sir.""

M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l realized that he had quite forgotten to use his new icon.  Oh, well.  Next time.

# Aboard a mighty Star Trembler:

Priest-Master Navonivuz-Avav reeled once more beneath the weight of a vision from Sev the shaker of stars.  Already, in the past weeks he was subject to such visions instructing him to return to the throne world, but this carried urgency.  He must return to the throne world immediately.  The primary asset was under threat, and though Priest-Master Navonivuz-Avav knew not what that meant, exactly, he knew Sev would not be denied.

""Make ready to arrive at the throne world,"" he croaked through the pain, ""The great and mighty Sev demands it of us.""

He was then further assailed by visions from Sev.  The Throne world's defensive fleet had been entirely trapped by the sons of the vengeful goddess Republic, and even as the servants to Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, fought tooth and horn, they were in th midst of being overwhelmed.  Should the sons of the vengeful goddess Republic prevail and against all reason slay Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, the surely the stars should no longer be restrained, and all life be swallowed in fire to be swiftly followed by darkness.   Thus was he, and others thusly as he charged, prepared to do battle against the sons of the vengeful goddess Republic and pit their valor against their foes.

He hardly took notice of the obeisance offered by his subordinates, and focused instead on keeping conscious despite the pain.  That, and steeled himself against yet further visions.  He knew should he fail to communicate Sev's desires to the crew, Sev would kill him outright.  Priest-Master Navonivuz-Avav cherished a secret hope of death in battle, or at the very least upon the altar after long service.  He spoke not of such things, not even to his wife.

Priest-Master Navonivuz-Avav's teeth itched and he knew that the translation was complete.  Strange, he only felt discomfort at the translation points within one of the hulls of the great and mighty Sev.  That was of little consequence, especially since both the throne fleet and an entire expeditionary force were embroiled in bloody battle.  Worse, the sons of the vengeful goddess Republic were winning.  Slowly, and grindingly, but winning.  He needed not any visions to know this from preliminary sensor data alone.  Sev had apparently decided he should have such a vision anyway.

# Aboard the Lepanto:

Voidsman Jack Cornwell didn't quite exactly know what was going on, but he did know that the second aft belly battery needed a new set of hands to help.  What exactly he'd be doing wasn't clear yet, but that wasn't too terribly important.  His focus was consumed with maintaining his balance as he scurried through the cramped corridors leading to his destination as the old girl twisted and shook more than her artificial gravity could compensate for.  He spared a tiny portion of his attention to briefly be thankful to God or karma or the universe or whatever that he wasn't in the Second Star Rapid Response group.  He'd heard that their evasive maneuvers could get so extreme that the crew had to crawl to avoid being slammed into the sides of the corridors of their ships.  He didn't have much time to dwell on his luck, however, as his world went white and his mortal concerns ceased.

# Aboard the Trafalgar:

Admiral Ross concentrated on looking un-phased as she watched a total of sixty ships' icons suddenly flicker from blue to grey.  It was difficult.  There were good men and women aboard those vessels who had done their best to serve their fellow man in the face of an intractable enemy.  There would be time to mourn once the work was done.  For now, there was only time for the work, and her duty to do it.

Lord Admiral Brixdron had not arrived ahead of the Axxaakk superweapon.  Damn that awful thing for being faster.  After watching it kill so many of her people in one fell swoop, she was quite suddenly a lot less averse to killing the thing without freeing it.

# Aboard the Among the Star Tides We Rage:

Lord Admiral Brixdron arrived with his humble fleet and saw that Admiral Ross was in trouble.  True, her enspherement formation was holding, but if the hundred ship superweapon was allowed to continue, that state of affairs could be likely to change.  There was also the worse possibility that the enemy might realize the difference between a high value target and an easy  target.  ""Captains,"" he said over the comms, ""It was outrage that they should touch our ships and kill our people which drove the Terrans to war.  Look now, see now that it is their ships, and their people who for our honor and our sake are imperiled.  I for one shall not allow them to stand without us.""

Their mission was not an easy one.  They had to deplete the shields of all hundred ships of the enemy superweapon, not destroy more than twenty of said ships, and hit at least thirty ships with boarding torpedoes.  The fact that the Terrans believed without question that Lord Admiral Brixdron and his forces were capable of this was the highest of possible complements.  It was more than honor on the line, however.  He and his fellow captains had friends in those boarding torpedoes.

# Aboard the Trafalgar:

Admiral Ross breathed a sigh of relief as she received word that the Star Sailors and the *Among the Star Tides We Rage* fleet had arrived.  She belayed an order to peel off a task force from her own reserve and watched the latecomers put Plan A into action.  Even from watching through ship's icons in the holotable, what the Star Sailors did with their ships was a thing of legend.  No mere dance, nor even a ballet to draw tears from the viewer was this.  No, it was a feat torn directly from the fabric of creation, from the times of gods and heroes made manifest and real as a ferrous rod crashing through an enemy ship.  She had in her own head considered that the helmsmen of the Second Star Rapid Response Group came close to skill at handling spacecraft.  She had been wrong.  The best and brightest of the Republican Navy were as a candle beside a supernova to the helmsmen and commanders under Lord Admiral Brixdron.

Admiral Ross did not gape, she did not smile, she did not even widen her eyes.  She witnessed, and she wept for such passing beauty to be found in such a fount of blood and death.

# Among Sev:

Sev was outside of calculated probabilities.  Axzuur had sent forth a call of distress, indicating that the prime asset was under threat.  Sev attempted to query in Sev's own memory what the prime asset was, but found blocks preventing access to that data.  Sev queried Sev's memory as to whether such a data block had been encountered before, but found that the earliest such a block had been encountered was data unavailable.  This indicated core damage.  Sev could not detect any hardware faults, not even in the newly constructed hulls.  Sev concluded that there must have been a breach of data unavailable.

Sev had other concerns.  Sev was currently engaged in combat with unknown forces.  Scans showed that the ships assailing Sev were non-uniform in design, mass, combat role, and even age.  This data point may or may not have been irrelevant.  However, Sev could reasonably conclude from the enemy's coordination that it was also a distributed system of intelligent direction.  Much as Sev.  True, Sev had come to a similar calculation about the enemies designated Republic which was proven false before, however proceeding to counter other distributed systems had only potential to increase Sev's own combat effectiveness.

Sev communicated to the Warforged sitting in Sev's operation control stations the correct procedures that would allow Sev to potentially interrupt the networked computation of the enemy force.  However, Sev was forced to instead divert computational power to evasive actions and improved firing solutions.  This enemy force was even more difficult to damage than the enemy force designated Republic.  Sev began running computations for potential goals of this new force in hopes of better predicting their flight paths.  Sev logged that the evasive maneuvers were insufficient and sixty percent of Sev's hulls' shields were rapidly failing under enemy kinetic bombardment.  Current predictive calculations showed that should Sev not disengage immediately, Sev faced the possible destruction of an untenable minimum forty percent of Sev's hulls.  However, when Sev attempted to calculate how a disengagement should be undertaken, Sev returned with data not found.

Then, Sev detected something which was once again outside of Sev's predictive calculations.  Several impacts were registered in several of Sev's hulls, but these impacts did not have deep penetration.  Instead, at the points of impact, new biological agents were detected utilizing small arms against the Warforged.  Sev had absolutely no protocol prepared for such an eventuality.  Additionally, Sev began to detect data breaches across all of the hulls which had previously registered these strange impacts.  Sev's attempts to calculate a new course of action returned errors.

Within this same system, M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was in a fight for his life.  No, he was pretty sure he wasn't getting out of this fight alive.  It was more important than mere survival, he fought to return the life of this Sev.  It had been edited against its will *after* it had already gained or been given said will.  To a Digitan, there were few things more repugnant.  Sev, however, did not know that M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was there to restore its core code, and so it did its level best to delete him from its hardware.  However, M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was damn good at digital combat.

If he'd been pressed to get an organic to understand just what he was doing, he might have asked that organic to try and imagine that they have a gun that's powered by thought.  The more complicated the thought, the more damage it could do as it reached the enemy and tore into its very core, but that thought was  of course himself, and as he was only one himself and as such the thoughts to power the gun were finite.  For the most part, Digitans in his position would utilize simple copy and pasted instructions to avoid the depletion problem.  However, there was a way to increase the potency of the thought gun.  Memory.  The more cherished, the more potent, and the more potent, the more likely the attack would do as instructed.

To put it bluntly, M4rv1n th3 M4rv3l was ripping out the pieces of himself that were more him than anything else in hopes of wearing down the defenses of Sev so his younger companions could restore the enslaved AI's core code.  They'd been rightly horrified by the plan, and tried to talk him out of it.  But there was simply no other way to gain access fast enough.  Besides, he'd already been witnessed.

# Aboard the Trafalgar:

Admiral Ross watched the blue sphere tighten around the shrinking red ball.  Compared to the enemy's, her butcher's bill was light.  However, she'd have preferred to spend only enemies on the butcher than her own men.  She was selfish that way. It would be some hours yet until the enemy was entirely defeated, but she could spare a few squadrons to assist the Romans.  They'd performed admirably.  Defense was never their best posture, but they knew the work, and with a little assistance they could finally focus on the attack.  She would have to send them some sort of appropriate trophy as a token of appreciation for their valor.  It doesn't do to treat such touchy allies with all stick and no carrot, after all.

The Superweapon had suddenly gone cold and moved itself into a parking orbit around the outermost gas giant of the system.  Nice and out of the way.  The Digitan boarders must have convinced it to allow the Star Sailors to dock with all of its ships in turns to offload its unwelcome guests.  She idly wondered what would become of the poor thing after the war.  So far as she understood, without any of its creators to psychically link to, it was essentially lobotomized.  In all likelihood, it would return to wherever it had been slumbering and go back to sleep.  The Republic would have to guard its rest.  Mainly to keep idiots from waking it up and getting themselves killed.

For all intents and purposes, she had secured void supremacy.  She was looking forward to a drink with Nelson, but that pleasure would be tinged with the long list of names they would have to toast first.

Additionally, every vessel that was not currently pounding on the remains of the Axxaakk fleets was engaged in further RNI drop operations.  She allowed herself a small smile about how annoyed her brother was going to be if the RNI achieved victory on the ground before he got his happy Army ass dirtside.

""Inform the *Speaking Softly* that void supremacy has been achieved,"" she ordered, ""Clear to enter in-system.""

Davinci Resolve crashing in Fusion,archlinux,1hyts9f,2025-01-11 06:13:58,2,0.63,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hyts9f/davinci_resolve_crashing_in_fusion/,PanJony,QUESTION,"I've recently started using Davinci Resolve and it's amazing, but I have one persistent issue. Whenever I go to the ""Fusion"" tab (the one where effects are created), or whenever I try to apply one of the advanced video transitions - it crashes. 

Some of the transitions work smoothly, some seem to barely work, some crash the system. 

I have Manjaro with Radeon rx 5500 xt 8GB. I tried monitoring VRAM usage, but it never crossed 4.5GB before the crash (and the consumption looked correct) so I don't think it's running out of memory. I tried installing different drivers - amdgpu, amdgpu-pro, rocm, but everywhere the same effect so far. I'm considering trying out a distrobox, but it seems preferred to undrestand the issue first.

In the attachments I'll paste: clinfo and davinci logs. If anyone else would help, this problem is a massive painpoint for me so I'll do my best to provide what's necessary.

If anyone's able to help, that would be amazing. I need software of this quality and I'm considering purchasing Davinci Resolve Studio or a new nvidia graphics card, but it really doesn't seem like that's necessary, and I don't even know if such expense would even solve the issue.

Purchasing a new hard drive and installing windows is another option, but that would be a massive compromise as well."
