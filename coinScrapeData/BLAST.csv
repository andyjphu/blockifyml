"The crowd was immaculate - 25th Jan, Ahmedabad",coldplayindia,1i9xfv6,2025-01-25 16:23:40,1,1.0,0,https://v.redd.it/czkr7sh5j7fe1,Money-Adhesiveness83,,"I reached a little late to the concert at around 6:45 pm and I would say that it was perfectly alright because the sets before Coldplay were a bit weak.

The crowd went wild when Coldplay started at exactly around 8 pm. Yellow was amazing as usual, sky full of stars was my favourite of the set. I loved every second of most of the songs except a few songs I genuinely didn‚Äôt know the lyrics for. It was an amazing experience and I‚Äôm sure tomorrow will be awesome!

This experience would have been up another level if they performed Yellow, Paradise or Sky full of stars once again because the crowd shouted ‚Äúonce more‚Äù really loud but they stuck to their set and that‚Äôs perfectly okay. And I believe the crowd near the stage had a better, immersive experience but they probably had to stand for a long time. Trade offs.

Anyways, I hope everyone on this sub who attended the shows till now had a wonderful time and I know tomorrow‚Äôs show is going to be a blast! Have fun guys. I definitely had fun and I‚Äôm grateful.

Should I play the DLCs in KCD 1 before playing KCD 2?,kingdomcome,1i9xdkz,2025-01-25 16:20:49,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1i9xdkz/should_i_play_the_dlcs_in_kcd_1_before_playing/,FokinGamesMan,:dialog_mirrored: Discussion :dialog:,"So I am currently playing through KCD for the first time, and having a blast. After about 70 hours of playtime and having completed a lot side content, I am now approaching the final stretch of main quest-line. 

The only things left for me to do are miscellaneous things like ""activities"", treasure maps and repeatable stuff like the tourney. However considering I have the best sword, very good armor and is essentially level 20 on all important skills I see little reason to continue doing any of those things.

I am considering buying some of the DLCs individually as there is no bundle available on steam. Obviously the game is not out yet, but for those who have played the DLCs - do they seem like they will be offering important stories that connect heavily with KCD 2? If so, which ones?"

[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/s/ZwArjJHl34)

As I mentioned yesterday, **our crowd truly does impact the game like an invisible 12th man on defense, and there is no reason why we shouldn't perform just as well at our 12th man duties as the other 11 players on the field**, and so I decided to start a daily post to put out some advice to other crowd-goers to make sure the 12th man is humming like thirty seven monster trucks in the Sprint Center.

Yesterday I wrote about the ""When"" of **Being as Loud as Possible**. Read more about it in yesterday's post, but in summary, be loud during:

1. Offensive Play-calling (QB with his hands over his ears)
2. Offensive Huddle
3. QB Cadence (Offense lined up)

Today, I will be writing about the ""How"" of being loud. I just popped my sleeping pills, so this post will be a little more brief and serious than yesterday's because I have to get through this one before I start thinking its a good idea to write posts on reddit.

  
So with that, let's get started.

# How to Be Loud

Just like yesterday, I'm going to break this down into parts. How to be loud can be summarized in:

1. Prepare & Warm up
2. This is a Marathon
3. Don't be Muffled

**Prepare & Warm up**

It is a good idea to get and stay hydrated. Don't lose your voice the night before.

As for right before the game, do you see what the athletes do about 90 minutes before they game out on the field? That's called *warming up*, and as the 12th man it is your responsibility to do the same for your voice.

I'll be honest, I'm not a pro at this particular skill, so I'm not going to give a precise routine. But what I will say is, in every sport, warmups involve very light activity (so talking or humming in this case) to get the muscles warm. So talk lightly and humm lightly to get and keep the vocal chords warm.

**This is a Marathon**

Imagine the Chiefs are up by 2 in the 4th quarter with 5 minutes left, but the Bills have the ball on their 27. Josh Allen has put his hands over his helmet to hear the play (part 1 of WHEN to be loud), and you start yelling... oh wait, what's that, you lost your voice, and nobody can hear you? ""The twelfth man is in the tent with the trainers, and I don't think he will becoming back in."" announces Jim Nantz. ""Oh I don't knowwww, Jim."" Chimes Romo.

Morgan Freeman: Romo really didn't know.

...

Let's be real, you don't want to find yourself in the above situation. You are a marathoner in this event, or maybe a mountaineer. You want to selectively choose times to be the most intense, but just like a marathoner falling over the finish line, you want to lose your voice when that red and yellow confetti blasts into the air.

You may be tempted to use your ""head voice"" but you can probably use your ""chest voice"" for longer.

**Don't be Muffled**

""Everybody is going to be wearing a ski mask. People aren't going to be standing and cheering. They're going to be huddled. Wearing wool. Trying to stay warm. Wearing something over their mouths. Home-field advantage via the crowd... DONE."" - Colin Cowherd, about Chiefs fans in the playoffs (thanks to some commenters who pointed this out yesterday - [Different-Package200](https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Package200/)  
 and [Ka-Is-A-Wheelie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ka-Is-A-Wheelie/)).

Please stay warm, but remember this quote if you decide to keep your mouth covered by a ski mask while yelling at the Bills from 80 yards away.

# Closing Remarks

To summarize, the three parts of HOW to be loud are:

1. Prepare & Warm up
2. This is a Marathon
3. Don't be Muffled

That's all I got for the main topic of today. As I put out these posts, some of the ideas are evolving a bit. One of the commenters yesterday ([pornokitsch](https://www.reddit.com/user/pornokitsch/)) pointed out that there have been Chiefs home games where the crowd went silent during the huddle, and that this felt like a missed opportunity. I don't know about you, but I don't want that to be the case this coming Sunday. The fewer people who know the three parts of WHEN to be loud ([Day 1 Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/1i72ajn/day_1_of_posting_12th_man_strategy/)) the greater risk there is of missing this opportunity (hint: share that post, or heck, repost it. I don't care).

Luckily I got through this post before the sleeping pills kicked in too hard. Talk to you loons tomorrow."

Original post can be found on my profile. 

Not sure of anyone still cares,  but i have seen the same question pop up again and again in the subreddits about parents not agreeing to love marriage due to culture and caste issues and whether to keep fighting or give up.

In response to those i would like to share an update. I had posted the original post ~2 years ago or so where my bf's parents were not agreeing to our marriage (the details of my oroginal post can be found on my profile). 

To all those who question whether or not it is worth it to stuggle with family and go through fights to marry your love- it is 100% worth it and even more. After going through fights, emotional talks, threats and the century long question of log kya kahenge, hume samaaj se nikaal denge etc.  our parents finally agreed and when our families met each other at first they were a bit nervous but just in a couple of days eveyone just gelled well with each other. 

Me and my boyfriend got engaged 2 days ago with full blast in front of all the family members, extended family and other knowns and it was uptil now the happiest day of both of our lives. My bf/fiance had a smile from one ear to the other and he was soaking every moment of seeing his family spoil me with so much love. 

Our journey was so difficult, we spent night crying into each other's arms. Doubted if our families ever will agree but for both of us, one thing was certain that we wanted to do this life with each other. Good or bad. 

Since his family agreed i also ensure that i take steps to learn their laguage, respect their culture and customs and learn to cook a bit in their style. I call my in laws nearly every other day and just talk to them to build our bond. 

If you are in this situation, this is your sign. It is difficult. It probably the most difficult thing ever. But once it works out, the pain of all of that hardwork of getting your families to agree just vanishes. Do not give up on your love, we did not and we are happy ‚ù§Ô∏è

Tl;dr: me and bf are nor engaged after struggling for 2 years to get our families to agree. 

Mods i am not asking any question in this post, but it is one of hope and love winning at the end. I wish others who are in this situation to find some courage through this msg, so i request please not to delete. "

My worst date - Amazon woman takes nerd bowfishing,sweetnsourpod,1i9x0io,2025-01-25 16:04:35,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweetnsourpod/comments/1i9x0io/my_worst_date_amazon_woman_takes_nerd_bowfishing/,MisterMrErik,Podcast suggestions,"So, this was years ago when I was fresh out of college. I would go on 2-3 dates per week as I was new to the area and I was in my ""yes to everything"" era. I met a girl on Tinder, we went to dinner. Dinner went well, and it was \~9pm when the dinner was wrapping up that she asked me ""Do you want to come bowfishing with me?"".

I said ""sure, what time?"" and she responded ""right now"".

We went back to my apartment to get some boots and change into jeans, because I figured we would be walking through mud and dirt. **I was not prepared enough.**

The date quickly progressed through 3 levels of **bad**:

# Level 1: Maybe she's not for me

She offered to drive. It was late at night, and she told me there was a great shortcut to get to the stream. She was blasting country music and speeding 70mph in a 45mph area until we reached a parking lot near a graveyard. Walking through the graveyard was the shortcut. At this point she was my ride back home, so I couldn't exactly protest and leave. She grabbed some equipment from her trunk, and we walked through the graveyard (on the designated walking path, not on graves) to a stream.

# Level 2: This woman is Tarzan. I am NOT Jane.

We go to a bridge and she hands me a flashlight. She says ""point the flastlight at the fish you see in the stream and I'll shoot them"". I don't know if I'm dumb, blind, or both, but I couldn't see fish anywhere. *I felt like a child holding a flashlight for my dad when he was fixing stuff in the crawlspace under the house.* She repeated: ""Hold the flashlight steady! Aim it over there! Do you know what you're doing????"" but eventually I figured it out.

**Then she Urgot ults some fish.** Straight up shoots the arrow directly into a fish, the arrow has a fishing line on it, so she reels it in, and then stomps on it in front of me. ""These carp are very invasive, so we just fish them out and kill them.""

I'm a city boy who struggles to kills spiders. At this point I'm mentally holding on for dear life.

# Level 3: Emsculation is an understatement

Remember how I said I was not prepared enough? Well, I'm wearing hiking boots and jeans. She's in short shorts and rubber thigh-high boots. She says ""Hey let's go over there."" and points across the stream to a small island as she starts to wade into a shallow part of the stream. It was only 2-3 feet deep. I say ""I'm not dressed for this"" and she looks at me and without skipping a beat says ""Oh that's true... Hop on my back!""

So I did.... I **hopped on her back** and she carried me across the stream. Now this woman is my ride back across the stream AND my ride home. She urgot ulted a few more fish and I think she noticed I was not having much fun, so she called it a day and took me home.



Needless to say, we did not have a second date. I actually started dating my now fiancee shortly after her but I set her up with my fiancee's friend who actually loves bowfishing. His reaction: ""She's way too country for me."" This was years ago, but I think I still have a video or 2 from her social media that shows her bowfishing that I can share privately (don't want to dox her)."

I think of moments like Shanks vs Whitebeard that I can't help but think if this scene was animated today, it would have been a drawn out energy-attack fest with lightning firing into the sky and tidal waves flying away from the ship.

I think of moments like when Luffy first fought Kaido and how in the manga it was a single quick blow from Kaido, making him seem bored from how effortlessly he took out Luffy, but in the anime, they made it seem like Luffy actually put up a decent effort and Kaido actually exerted himself. All the battles in Wano and Egghead where characters are full on flying while attacking with energy blasts. 

What would the attack on Enies Lobby have looked like if it was done with the current animation? IMO it would have made it way, way less enjoyable, even if it didn't add much in the way of filler.

Thoughts? Y'all enjoy the current animation? "

**Chapter 10: Blazing spear:**

As Kosma walked back to the courtyard, Jed saw a marker appear on one of the gunships,

¬†

""Hey Kosma... looks like you get to ride in that thing, sure beats walking!"" her face lit up as Jed said that. Kosma started to run excitedly towards the plane when she felt something pulling at her backpack.

¬†

""NO, YOU DON'T!"" said Kalax as Kosma stared back at him, flicking her ears back and giving the captain a glare.

¬†

""It's so damn cute when you do that..."", Jed admitted, which only made Kosma angrier,

¬†

""Shut up!"" she squirmed in Kalax's iron grip as he finally let go, causing Kosma to fall to the ground with a loud thud. It took restraint, but Jed made no comment.

¬†

""The enemy has set up anti-aircraft batteries around the pulse cannon, we have already lost three of our dropships to them,"" Kalax explained as he displayed a holographic map from a projector on his shoulder while the troopers gathered around it. There was a heavy anti-aircraft battery protected by small armor at each corner of the cannon's platform. Kalax pointed to a large road that rose above the jungle, connecting the control center to the position of the anti-orbital gun.

¬†

""We'll take this logistics highway all the way to their position, but if our scouts are right, we should expect very heavy resistance. We only need to take out one of those batteries and our transports can land... AM I CLEAR TROOPERS!"" the troopers quickly replied with a resounding ""YES SIR!"", with a metallic ""clank"" as their left hand slammed against their chest as they performed the Indaran salute.¬† Horror washed over Kosma's face at the thought of having to walk all the way to the pulse cannon, and Kalax only confirmed that the path would be littered with enemies. It would be a long slog.

¬†

""If you want, we can stop here. Doesn't look like any enemies are coming,"" Jed said, seeing how beaten Kosma looked,

¬†

""No, let's just do this... it would be incredibly annoying to try to sleep with the warzone atmosphere all around, I mean, blow up the enemy mothership with the cannon and we win, right?"" she asked with a nervous smile.

¬†

""I really hope this is the end of the level, this seems like a fun place to stay... you know, when there aren't murder-bots everywhere..."", Jed replied as Kosma nodded in agreement.

Kosma followed the group as the troopers chatted among themselves. They might only be simple AIs, but the fact that they were robots made it ironically a little easier for Kosma to pretend they were real. As they walked past a cargo bay full of containers and automated vehicles sitting idle at their stations. Kosma ran quickly to try to activate one of them, but to no avail,

""COME ON!... I really don't want to slog through this on foot. Jed, does a prompt appear to interact with any of these?"" asked Kosma as she hooked a cable from her wrist terminal into one of the trucks and randomly tapped things on the interface.

¬†

""At least you have the robots with you... what's left of them,"" Jed replied with a hint of sadness as Kosma resigned herself to walking to the enemy position. As the huge sliding doors leading to the highway opened with a loud hydraulic hiss, Kalax turned to look at Kosma,

¬†

""Trailblazer, I have some very distressing news,"" his tone was incredibly dark and made her fear what information he was about to give her,

¬†

""Y...yes?"" she asked out of pure reflex, though she knew he would continue his dialog anyway,

¬†

""I know how much it meant to you to walk over 8000 meters of bridge, but I ordered APCs to carry us as it will be safer,"" the Captain explained ironically, Kosma tilted her head to the side as she imagined the non-existent mocking grin on his mouthless face. His eyes, however, managed to express the joking tone as he pointed at a pair of incoming Sadurian defense force transports,

¬†

""Son of a..."" Kosma exclaimed, her face lighting up as she watched the transports descend before them, dropping a pair of six-wheeled APCs before flying away. The boxy vehicles were covered in angular armor, the logo of the 118th Battalion stamped on the side next to the vehicles' serial numbers. As the doors opened, she noticed that the transports had room for a gunner, a driver, and eight passengers.

They could see the battle raging throughout the facility, with the defense turrets on the control building shooting down enemy dropships and squadrons of defense drones fighting some kind of enemy equivalent. Still hopelessly outnumbered, the defenses would at least hold the line until they shot down the mothership. Deep down, however, Kosma and Jed knew that the battle was nothing more than a skybox, albeit a convincing one.

The APCs had been delivered with just enough troops to fill every seat, including hers and Kalax's. He turned to Kosma and pointed to the vehicle on the left,

""Get on the turret of the rampart,"" the captain ordered as Kosma boarded the vehicle, relief washing over her. She knew they would have to fight through a bunch of enemies to get to the other side, but at least it would not necessarily be easier. The rampart APCs would make it faster, especially if she didn't have to drive. The interior was a bit cramped, but that was to be expected from a military transport, Kosma was just glad to have a comfortable padded seat.

The moment she got into the vehicle, the camera zoomed in as Kosma got into the gunner's seat and stared at the controls, unsure what to do, when a popup appeared with the controls for Jed.

¬†

""Uhhh... yeah, because of course I can operate military hardware without training..."" as she spoke, Jed tested the controls, her hands automatically reaching for a joystick at her side and pressing a button that lowered a screen showing a camera view of the turret.

¬†

""It says... I can transform the weapon?"" Jed said a little confused as he pressed the middle mouse button. The APC's weapon rotated, transforming into something shorter but wider as Jed fired a large burst of blue energy bolts at it, which spread out in a cone pattern. Switching back to its original mode, the barrel lengthened and the weapon's struts retracted, making it appear thinner as ventilation slits opened on the sides. This mode fired a concentrated burst of energy, presumably designed to take out armored targets, while the other mode was designed to hit groups of smaller enemies.

¬†

""Now that's weird..."" said Jed, switching between modes, firing at lampposts and inactive driverless vehicles to test the weapon.

¬†

""Jed... get your hands off that keyboard. I always wanted to fire one of those things!"", Kosma excitedly fired the weapon, riddling a nearby car with holes from the dispersal mode, then firing a concentrated blast at the engine, causing it to erupt in a fiery explosion,

¬†

""YESSSH!"" Kosma exclaimed with a sadistic grin, feeling like she could take on anything with this turret,

¬†

""Hey psycho, when you are ready to go give the word,"" Jed playfully replied, making Kosma frown, she tried to look at the camera but could feel it was somehow outside the vehicle.

¬†

""Well, let's go... I want to see what this thing does to the robots!"" she made the turret face forward as Jed pressed the interaction button to close the tutorial popup. Shortly thereafter, a female robot voice exclaimed

¬†

""Next stop, anti-orbital cannon!"", the transports began to move forward, side by side. The APC was driven by a slightly smaller and thinner trooper with a less angular design and a vaguely feminine shape.

¬†

""What the hell? Who's driving?"" asked Jed, slightly confused.

¬†

""Another trooper?"" Kosma replied as she moved the turret from side to side, scanning for enemies.

¬†

""Why would they make female and male robots?"" wondered Jed aloud.

¬†

""Originally they all had the same voice, but the support troopers were made smaller and with lighter armor to fit better on vehicles and be more mobile, the soldiers kept calling them female troopers soo... on the next versions they just gave them a girly voice, pretty silly if you ask me,"" she explained while trying to adjust the turret seat to a comfortable position.

¬†

""It probably helps morale, she sounds kind of cute!"" said Jed, oblivious to the jealous look Kosma shot at the driver.

¬†

""JED! ARE YOU HORNY FOR A PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE?"" yelled Kosma as she poked her head out of the turret hatch.

¬†

""I just said she looks cute, I can't even see what she looks like from this angle... Get back inside, I see something approaching!"", Kosma grumbled as she got back inside and closed the hatch. Seeing that a group of heavy walkers and spider-bots had set up a roadblock, she quickly opened fire, Kalax's transports following shortly after.

¬†

""DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT ON ME, BOY!"" a very jealous Kosma shouted as she blasted the roadblock with the turret.

¬†

""Can we discuss this when we're not in combat!"", Jed replied, starting to raise his voice, he didn't want Kosma to get killed over such a stupid argument.

¬†

¬†""Relax, this thing is bolt-proof, ironically it feels like playing a video game. I'm not really mad,"" she said in a cheerful tone, easing Jed's worries, although she was a bit jealous of this driver-trooper.

¬†

They spread out easily to take care of groups of small robots, adjusting their spread pattern based on the distance to the targets. Sending shards of metal everywhere as their power cores exploded violently on impact. One of the heavy walkers locked its weapons on Kosma's APC, firing large bolts of energy into the armor. The attack shook the transport, nearly knocking Kosma out of her seat and making her regret that she hadn't used her seatbelt, something she quickly set about correcting. However, the attack only managed to dent the plating and take a small portion of the vehicle's health bar.

She fired back using the turret's armor piercing mode, which didn't seem to be very effective against the machine's thick front plating, sending sparks and a burst of plasma on impact as the bolts dissipated against it.

¬†

""Aim for its ocular sensor to stun it, if you have bad aim, shoot for the legs,"" the captain advised over the comms as Kosma struggled to aim the weapon while taking enemy fire.

¬†

""Need help?"", Jed offered.

¬†

""No, no... otherwise I'll never learn"", after a few seconds of fiddling with the control joystick she managed to blow three legs off the walker, causing it to collapse to the ground and burst into flames shortly after.

¬†

""NICE SHOT!"" Jed and Kalax shouted simultaneously, making Kosma dizzy.

¬†

A Sadurian gunship, followed by a pair of enemy fighter drones, began to fly parallel to the transports,

¬†

""Get these things off me, sir!"" the pilot yelled over the comms as Kosma turned the turret and began guiding the targets and peppering them with disperse mode.

¬†

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING P-26!? YOU ARE APPROACHING AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY!"" By the time the pilot heard Kalax's warning, it was too late as a missile hit the gunship in one of its engines. It spun out of control as it barreled toward the bridge, Kosma's APC narrowly avoiding it. The gunship's fuel tank exploded as it hit the pavement.

""Damn... no survivors, don't stop,"" Kalax said in his usual stern voice as the drones turned their attention to the transports and began to follow them.

The drones fired salvos of rockets at the APCs as Kosma swung the turret to face them. She heard one of the missiles explode right next to the vehicle, causing it to lurch sideways as the suspension did its best to absorb the shock.

¬†

""AAAHHH!"" Kosma exclaimed as the jolt made her head hit the screen hard, shattering the glass. Had she not been wearing her helmet, she probably would have broken her nose. At least the screen was still working.

She alternated between intercepting the missiles and firing at the drones themselves, with Jed helping her aim. One of the drones crashed into the jungle as she managed to inflict critical damage, while the other rammed in front of the transports and into a truck loaded with energy cells, causing it to explode in an azure blast of energy and electric arcs that temporarily disrupted the vehicles' electronics. The drivers stopped immediately,

¬†

""DAMN IT!"" yelled Kalax as he stared at the massive gap created by the explosion, as a voice came over a nearby PA speaker as a security camera stared at the APCs,

¬†

""I would appreciate it if you would stop damaging my facility more than the invaders! However, I know a way you can cross, let me angle the solar panels,"" the voice belonged to the Indaran technician monitoring their progress from the control facility. Soon gaps opened in the ground at the sides of the road and large photovoltaic panels appeared, angled toward the transports with one side raised toward the abyss.

¬†

""Do they want us to..."" said Kosma in a worried voice, noticing that the solar panels were wide enough to fit the entire APC,

¬†

""YOU HEARD THE MAN! PUNCH IT!"" shouted Kalax in a commanding voice, but the vehicles didn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Kosma saw more enemy drones approaching from the front and prepared herself,

¬†

""Sir... are you suffering from suicidal impulses?"" the driver of the captain's APC replied in a condescending tone.

¬†

""KOSMA! GET YOUR TROOPER OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TAKE OVER!"", Kalax yelled as she heard shifting noises and troopers complaining over the comms,

¬†

""SIR! SEEK A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!"", Kosma heard the driver protest as she got out of the turret seat and made her way to her driver,

¬†

""Uhh... can you please go to the turret?... why am I even talking to this thing..."" she said, staring at the round face of her driver, when to her surprise the trooper answered, mainly thanks to Jed pressing the ""change seat"" button prompt,

¬†

""Ooo, I get to shoot the bad guys now!"" the trooper exclaimed excitedly as she got to the turret. Meanwhile, Kalax was having trouble with his own driver,

""Hey Trailblazer, just for the record, I would never hit a real woman,"" Kalax said over the comms before she heard a loud ""CLANG"" as the captain promptly slapped the trooper to take her place. Kosma could hear Jed laughing audibly over her head,

""ALLRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE LEFT, I TAKE THE RIGHT!"" Kalax ordered as his APC barreled towards one of the solar panels, Kosma staring at the wheels and pedals a bit confused,

¬†

""Jed... do you mind? It's been a long time since I've driven anything with wheels..."" the nervousness in her voice was palpable as the enemy drones were already firing missiles at her vehicle. Fortunately, the soldier on the turret was doing a good job of intercepting most of them,

¬†

""Absolutely!"" said Jed after a quick glance at the popup for the driving controls before accelerating towards the improvised ramp,

¬†

""CAPTAIN YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER I'VE SERVED WITH!"" shouted Kalax's former driver as her APC flew over the cap, Kosma's soon to follow. She felt the suspension bounce violently on contact with the ground as Jed lost control of the vehicle and veered toward a gap in the bridge's walls.

She screamed in terror as the transport plunged into the jungle below, Jed watching in horror as the APC crashed into some jagged rocks. For a few seconds, the camera hovered over the wrecked vehicle, the last checkpoint loaded as she was about to jump the gap,

¬†

""Kosma... I..."", Jed said as Kosma was about to tear off the steering wheel from the sheer stress of hyperventilating,

¬†

""I know Jed, I know,"" Kosma said with a deep, long sigh, ""No matter how many times it happens, it's still horrible... let's... LET'S DO THIS!"" she exclaimed, trying to keep her brave face on. She knew Jed understood her pain and stress, but it was something she mostly did to trick herself into moving forward without having constant breakdowns.

¬†

""Are you sure you want me to drive?"" asked Jed hesitantly as a missile hit the back of the APC, knocking Kosma to the ground,

¬†

""YES, YOU IDIOT!"" she shouted as Jed regained control and heard Kala's ex-driver repeat her voice line as her vehicle jumped with him following through the left solar panel. This time he made the jump, this time maintaining control of the vehicle as they barreled down the highway. Dodging enemy attacks as the trooper in the gunner's seat did her best to keep enemy drones off their tail.

¬†

While Jed hadn't exactly kept the APC intact, it was still running, and Kosma herself remained in one piece. They were almost at the anti-orbital cannon. A gigantic piece of artillery with a rectangular barrel the size of a skyscraper, secured by three pairs of struts along its length. It stood on a square pyramid-like base surrounded by fortifications that had been taken over by the enemy.

Kosma saw a pair of vanguard units at the base of the pyramid's access ramp. Their gunner was busy targeting something behind them, so Jed simply accelerated toward one of them. As was probably scripted, Kalax ran for the other, and the vanguard eliminators were crushed under the weight of the armored vehicles,

""WOOOHOOOOO!!! That was cathartic, this thing is unstoppable!"" shouted Kosma as she felt the last pair of wheels crush the robot,

¬†

""You... really don't want to know how much health we have left..."", Jed said with a hint of concern in his voice as he stopped abruptly in front of a row of pylons along their path,

¬†

""EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE TRANSPOT, WE MUST FOLLOW ON FOOT!"", Kalax shouted as the troopers started to get out of both vehicles. Reluctantly, Kosma got out of the driver's seat as she stared in shock at the sorry state of her APC. The few pieces of armor that hadn't fallen off were riddled with holes and dents, blackened from the fire and explosions, one of the rear wheels was missing entirely, and the headlights had been shot out. On the other hand, Kala's vehicle was spotless, as if it had just rolled off the assembly line,

¬†

""JED YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DRIVER!"" exclaimed Kosma as she pointed with both hands at her barely functioning ride,

¬†

""Unlike us, his was probably indestructible... I got us here in one piece, didn't I?"" replied Jed,

¬†

""That's... technically correct, when you rammed a rock through the cabin, I was only crushed by it, but not split in half,"" Kosma replied cynically,

¬†

""Please don't joke about such things,"" Jed replied in a hurt voice, feeling extremely guilty about the accident,

¬†

""Look, it's either cynical humor or crying... these batteries aren't going to blow themselves up, let's just get this damn level over with... I need a very long shower,"" Kosma said, trying to summon up the courage for the coming battle, as one of the Troopers pointed to something in the sky,

¬†

""INCOMING!"" he shouted as Jed saw red bullet-shaped symbols appear below them, causing Kosma to immediately move out of the way while Kalax pushed one of his troopers out of one of the circles. A single large shell split into a few dozen fragments mid-flight, landing exactly where the circles had predicted, blowing up the APCs and taking out a couple of troopers,

¬†

""YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE AND DESTROYED MY VEHICLE! YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER EVER!"" one of the drivers yelled at Kalax as he ran for cover,

¬†

""HAD I LET YOU KEEP DRIVING WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, NOW SHUT UP AND RUN TROOPER!"", Kalax replied,

¬†

""Can you see the icons too?"" asked Jed as Kosma froze in shock after a grenade exploded a few meters away from her,

¬†

""WHAT ICONS!?"" she yelled in confusion,

¬†

""The game will tell me where the shells will land, just give me full control, even if I make you stand still, okay?"" said Jed as he saw another set of circles appear, causing her to move slightly to the side. Kosma saw the grenades explode around her again, only a few meters away from turning her into red mist,

¬†

""Okay... that's not scary at all..."", Kosma said with a nervous laugh as Jed pushed her forward.

¬†

""Ma'am, I just wanted to let you know that I do not blame you for losing my vehicle..."", Kosma's former driver said in the sleepiest voice her voice modulator could produce. Kosma completely ignored her, having other priorities at the moment.

¬†

At the top of the pyramid, around the massive rotating base of the anti-orbital gun, the enemy had placed AA batteries at the four corners of the structure. The anti-aircraft weapons were large three-legged machines that bore a resemblance to heavy walkers, except they replaced the heavy repeating blasters with an array of missile tubes that fired at incoming security drones from the facility. Protected by dozens of spider-bots, the Heavy Walkers' vanguard units and battle drones, along with transports flying overhead, made Kosma wish she had stayed in the underwater facility.

Running from cover to cover, dodging mortar rounds, Kosma already felt defeated and braced herself for another long series of deaths,

¬†

""Jed... do you have a plan? because I doubt 16 troopers are going to do much against all of... THAT!"" she exclaimed as Jed made her dodge an incoming burst of enemy fire from a walker that took out a trooper behind her, ""15 troopers..."" she said amidst panting,

¬†

""I have a plan, but you won't like it, you've played your share of video games, right?"" asked Jed, struggling to concentrate on dodging the grenades and the conversation at the same time,

¬†

""Yeah..."" she nodded confused,

¬†

""You know when you get frustrated from dying too often and just run past the enemies to complete the objective?"" he asked as Kosma took a split second to give him an incredulous look,

¬†

""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DESTROY THE AA BATTERIES WITHOUT GETTING ANNIHILATED BY EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING!"" she shouted as a piece of shrapnel clipped one of the tips of her tail, making her squeal,

¬†

""Those mortars are relentlessly targeting you, and if you don't stop to attack something and spam your dodge move, we can just trick them into bombing their own robots!"" shouted Jed as a stray shot hit Kosma in the chest, her armor managing to absorb most of the impact,

¬†

""Ouch... good, now focus!"" said Kosma, crushing her last vial of regen-gel and shaking her head at how rude that came out, ""I mean it sounds like a decent plan, but enough chatter... let's do this!¬†

¬†

With her thruster-assisted dodge and rocket boots, she quickly outpaced Kalax and the troopers. Running into the middle of the enemy formation, Jed had them running in circles for a moment that felt like an eternity to Kosma as energy bolts came at her from all directions. Once she was surrounded, Jed waited for the markers of the next mortar strike and let her boost jump out of the way, the explosions from the barrage pushing her further.

She landed awkwardly, belly up, with burning robot parts raining all around her. She used her back-mounted thrusters to immediately get back up and continue her mad dash for the AA tripod,

¬†

""JED, I HATE YOU SO MUCH!"" she shouted as she parried a blow from a vanguard unit's blade before lunging backwards to see it torn apart by a blast from a heavy walker meant for her. She threw herself into the air again, and in a clearing in the jungle below, she caught a glimpse of the machine responsible for the mortars. Like its AA cousin, it was clearly based on the Heavy Walker, but thicker to support the weight of its massive armament. It had ground anchors that pinned it to the ground, presumably to keep it from tipping over from the recoil of firing the weapon.

¬†

""TRUST THE PROCESS!"" he replied, letting her slide right under the AA battery as the enemies swarmed around her. She heard the mortar fire and, sword in hand, dashed out from under the tripod. Skewering a spider-bot through its optical sensor, and fueled by adrenaline, she lifted the blade with the inert robot still impaled. She planted one foot on the ground and used the thrusters on her other boot to spin herself. Kosma gained enough momentum to slam the spider-bot into a vanguard eliminator, completely destroying its upper body along with her blade.

¬†

""KOSMA, THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE SEEN YOU DO!"" cheered Jed as he carried her out of the blast zone. She couldn't help but look back at the clustered group of enemies before the cluster shell rained death upon them.¬† The charge from the mortar rounds combined with the rockets in the tubes of the AA battery to create an explosion so massive that the reflective visor of Kosma's suit lowered to protect her eyes,

¬†

""Yep, that's what I was going for,"" Kosma bluffed, not wanting to admit that her blade had gotten stuck in the spider-bot's eye and she was shaking it because she couldn't get it out, the same went for her missile boot, which accidentally went off and sent her spinning out of control. And Jed pretended to believe her.

¬†

""STELLAR JOB KOSMA!"" she heard Kalax say over the radio,

¬†

As she set off to clear the remaining enemies from the position, the troopers had already caught up to her and opened fire on a group of spiders as they rushed the position,

¬†

""I WANT THAT ARTILLERY PIECE CLEARED FROM THE FACE OF IRUX!"" the captain ordered, putting a pair of fingers to the side of his head as he took cover from an incoming mortar barrage. Soon after, a gunship fired a volley of missiles at the mortar-bot, causing it to explode in a blast that knocked down the surrounding trees with its shockwave.

A large group of gunships and air transports, escorted by security drones, approached. They unleashed a dizzying amount of bolt fire and missiles, utterly destroying the few enemy aircraft patrolling the area. Kosma felt relief wash over her as the small fleet landed around them,

¬†

""Cavalry's here, Captain!"" a female soldier's voice, probably the pilot of one of the transports, exclaimed excitedly as a platoon of robot soldiers disembarked from the dropships. As the transports unloaded two heavy tanks, the ground shook as they separated from the aircraft,

¬†

""85 TONS OF NAROKAN ENGINEERING WITH A MINIATURIZED INDARAN PULSE CANNON!"" said Kalax, his fists on his hips, staring proudly at the armored behemoths. Then he wrapped his arms around the shoulders of the troopers originally assigned to drive their APCS,

¬†

""Ladies, we weren't able to assign drivers to the bulwarks, so I guess it's you,"" he explained as the troopers' faces literally lit up, before giving the captain an Indaran salute and rushing to the tanks' hatches,

¬†

""I went out of my way to order them without drivers, I know how those things get attached to their vehicles... let the troopers know and I will skin you alive and turn you into a fur coat to remind me of my days among the organic..."" the captain said in a somber tone, poking his finger into Kosma's chest plate,

¬†

""Awwww.... has a sweet spot!"" said Kosma as she brought her palms to her chest,

¬†

""Hell, I'd have a hot spot for those things too....have you seen her hips!"" she snapped her head at the camera the moment he said that, going so far as to raise the visor on her helmet to make sure he saw her scowl,

¬†

""If I could reach through the screen, I'd knock those stupid glasses right off your face..."" she muttered angrily,

¬†

""Kosma... we both know something completely different would happen if you could reach through the screen,"" Jed replied with a grin that Kosma couldn't see but felt in his voice, making her laugh nervously as she lowered the reflective visor so he wouldn't see her blush,

¬†

A robot with bulkier armor and a distinctive pauldron with the insignia of a planet orbited by two moons, probably indicating his rank as a lieutenant, approached the captain and saluted,

¬†

""Sir, we'll take it from here!"" the lieutenant shouted before turning to bark orders to his platoon to storm the remaining enemy positions.

¬†

Kosma saw a pair of engineers enter the pyramidal structure, and Kalax stopped her from following by extending his arm in front of her,

¬†

""Yes, I know the control room is in there, but if you fire that thing from inside... you won't be able to see the fireworks,"" the captain calmly explained as a broad smile formed on Kosma's face,

""Ohhoho no way.... NO WAY!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the struts along the barrel of the weapon disengaged. The entire structure vibrated as the massive pulse cannon aimed itself at the enemy mothership with a mighty mechanical roar. An amber glow spread through the cannon, emitting a low hum as unfathomable amounts of energy flowed into it, filling the air with static.¬† The captain looked at Kosma, his face projecting a simplified smiling emoticon hologram as he removed his wrist-mounted terminal,

¬†

""Say, do you want to do the honors?"" he said in the friendliest tone she'd ever heard him use, while handing Kosma the wrist terminal, which showed the hologram of a large red button,

¬†

""I DO!"", Kosma grabbed the device and hovered her finger over the button. Climbing onto a wrecked heavy walker to make sure she had the best possible angle, she turned to face the camera and raised the visor,

¬†

""Hey, I couldn't have done this without you... would you like to do the honors?"" said Kosma as a prompt to press the interaction button flashed on the screen,

¬†

""No way, you heard the man, he wants you to do it,"" Jed replied, surprised by Kosma's gesture, knowing how much firing powerful weapons meant to her. He couldn't possibly deny her the chance to fire the mother of all directed energy weapons,

¬†

""We do it at once, when I say fire, we both press it,"" she took a deep breath and looked at the enemy mothership,

¬†

""THREE, TWO, ONE... FIRE!"" they shouted as she placed her finger on the button while Jed placed his on the interaction button. Rings of energy shot from the cannon's body as a sphere of pure energy formed at its tip for a second before unleashing its power. A golden beam of concentrated pulse energy shot from the mighty weapon as it tore through the skies of Irux at the speed of light. Causing a cataclysmic explosion of amber light that split the enemy ship in half and sent it plummeting to the oceans below.

The shockwave from the explosion took a few seconds to reach the island, shaking the leaves of every tree in the jungle and causing Kosma's ears to flap in the wind as she removed her helmet,

¬†

""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"" Kosma cheered alongside the troopers as the enemy units began to shut down after losing the control signal from the battleship. While the vanguard eliminators were independent enough to function without the control signal, they had no choice but to surrender as they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Sadurian defense forces.

¬†

She took the liberty of stealing a working blade from one of the captured vanguard units and scavenging for some regen-gel to heal her tail before hopping on a gunship to take her back to the control center,

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was intense, I don‚Äôt know how it looked from the screen but‚Ä¶ damn I felt that shockwave go through me‚Äù, she said while staring at the tropical landscape from the window of the gunship,

¬†

‚ÄúI bet it was way cooler in person, you were incredible back there‚Äù, Jed complimented as he sighed in relief that Kosma was finally safe, when her intercom buzzed to life,

¬†

‚ÄúKosma, land on my carrier in orbit, we have to‚Ä¶‚Äù, Kalax was cut off as Kosma deactivated her intercom, and simply enjoyed the view as they flew her to the landing pad where she had parked her ship,

¬†

‚ÄúJed, if you don‚Äôt mind, I will put off adventures for a few days and relax here‚Ä¶ its beautiful, and all to myself‚Äù, Kosma said as she gave Jed a tired smile,

¬†

‚ÄúAbsolutely, it will be nice to put off the madness for a few days‚Ä¶ or weeks. Didn‚Äôt you say something about stealing food and candles? Maybe we could watch a movie together, I have to show you human science fiction‚Äù, said Jed excited about what she would think,

¬†

""It will be nice not to be torn to pieces for a change... when you get off I will take a looooong shower, raid the cafeteria and tomorrow I will steal a boat and go to the beach!"" she smiled excitedly as she laid out her plan,

¬†

""Sounds great, see you tomorrow Kosma, sorry about... all those deaths,"" Jed replied in a slightly sad tone as Kosma sat at the edge of the landing pad, just like when they came to the comms array,

¬†

""I'd still be having a nervous breakdown on Octanor Station if it wasn't for you, goodbye Jed"", Kosma said and waved at him before Jed closed the game and went on with the rest of his day, but not without taking some time to do some drawings of Kosma's journey in his sketchbook.

My Star Trek Re-Marathon: DS9 Season 4,startrek,1i9wj2s,2025-01-25 15:43:31,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1i9wj2s/my_star_trek_remarathon_ds9_season_4/,Sci-FiStorybook,,"Hi, back again with the next part of my Star Trek re-marathon. Just to say, because I forgot again, my favourite episode from VOY S1 was Caretaker: an excellent premiere. But now we're back onto DS9, and just to reiterate: everything is just my opinion, and spoilers for all Star Trek. Also this post is very long, so thank you very much for putting up with that!

**The Way of the Warrior**

After the haunting reveal of the Changelings being 'everywhere' at the end of S3 we see the Alpha Quadrant convulsing with fear over shapeshifting infiltration. This double-length season premiere truly has it all. The excellent introduction of Worf, whose joining DS9 feels like the natural next step for his character, combines with the Klingons entering as a major player into DS9's political landscape, as the big Alpha Quadrant powers start taking especial notice of the Dominion. I just love the Klingons being proper antagonists in Star Trek again. The story of their invasion of Cardassia is gripping, with huge impacts both for Worf personally and the Alpha Quadrant more widely. The Cardassians also play a valuable role in this, as we get the rather good news of a recent democratic revolution, but also see them forced onto the backfoot by the Klingons. I would also like to say that it blows my mind on a rewatch that this Martok is actually a Changeling. I mean, WOW. This episode has superb political intrigue, absolutely epic action sequences, and brilliant character stuff. **10/10**

**The Visitor**

And yet this episode, half the length, manages to be even better. Seeing Jake losing himself after his father's 'death', and how he goes to the most extreme lengths to get him back, is so heartrending. Cirroc Lofton does a fantastic job, and then Tony Todd really steals the show. The final scene between the two of them is so emotionally acted, I can't even. 'Jake, *no*!' And then Sisko goes back and embraces his son, knowing now what lengths Jake would truly go to for him. Certifiably my favourite episode of the season. **10/10**

**Hippocratic Oath**

Another early look at the Jem'Hadar, and while they are truly terrifying to me, this episode also does a great job of making you feel sorry for them. It's not their fault they're programmed to be brutish killers, and this one Jem'Hadar is (to a significant extent), questioning what he's been engineered to believe. You completely understand both Julian's and Miles' points of view. While Julian is inhabiting Starfleet's ideals, Miles ultimately makes the depressing, realistic call to save himself and his friend. The rupture in their relationship and the death of all those Jem'Hadar that result are so very weighty. **9/10**

**Indiscretion**

We start to see another side to Dukat, but we're never quite allowed to forget his inhumane side. I do love how they humanise him here, with his love for a dead Bajoran and the amusing, warming scene where he sits on a spike. Side by side with this is his continued insistence on how the Occupation (and himself) were 'good for Bajor'. And of course, the fact that he was going to kill his daughter. I really don't know if Dukat would have pulled the trigger or not had Kira not been there to influence him: I'm not sure he would have but I'm also not sure he *wouldn't* have. But he does in the end make a loving decision all the same. We see Dukat humanised, but we're never allowed to forget his foul side. **9/10**

**Rejoined**

A lovely, ultimately heartbreaking tale of love across traditional boundaries. Obviously the fact that it's two women isn't what's 'unacceptable' in the 24th Century, but making it a lesbian relationship adds a real-world edge to the narrative about two people who love each other kept apart by the cruel strictures of their society. I also do love the sci-fi dynamic, of two Trill reconnecting with someone from a past life. So lovely and so upsetting, especially at the end. **10/10**

**Starship Down**

Brilliant ensemble piece. Tense naval action at the beginning followed by an exciting exploration of several different paths on the Defiant. Really enjoy them all, honestly, but my favourites would have to be Kira trying to keep Sisko, her friend and her Emissary, awake, and Quark debating the finer points of business with a Karemma. **9/10**

**Little Green Men**

Hilarious twist on the army-finds-UFO trope. The misunderstandings, the deliberate deceptions: all brilliant. I love Quark being both shocked and enchanted by 1940s Earth, and his complete disregard for any temporal implications of his actions. And the Nurse character's optimism about a spacefaring future is infectious: no wonder Gene Roddenberry was able to get TOS made! **9/10**

**The Sword of Kahless**

I remembered not liking this one so much, but I really enjoyed it this time! It portrays the power that history and the thirst for triumph can have on people, as two honourable Klingons devolve into jealous, rageful beasts over the titular Sword. Very clever how a 'unifying symbol' can actually divide people precisely because of its cultural importance. **9/10**

**Our Man Bashir**

A hilarious, loving, mocking tribute/send-up of old James Bond films. Every actor is clearly having a blast in their roles, and my particular plaudits must go to Avery Brooks for nailing it as an insane Bond Villain, and Terry Farrell for playing a stereotypical submissive female character who's so ludicrously unlike Jadzia. And Garak's disbelief over what Julian thinks is spying is so funny. **9/10**

**Homefront/Paradise Lost**

DS9's superb Secret Invasion storyline intensifies, in a 2-parter that subverts everything Part 1 set up in Part 2. We're very aware as viewers of the threat the Founders pose, and are very much on Sisko and co's side when they pressure the President of the Federation into declaring martial law. But then the threads start getting unpicked in Part 2 and we see how fear of infiltration can make even members of the best of organisations (Starfleet) go against everything they stand for. And also, fantastic to see Cadet Nog at the Academy, and Sisko's dad rocks. And finally, the Changeling threat isn't *denied*: take that terrifying scene with the Changeling O'Brien. But it's made clear that paranoia like this is so destructive. **10/10**

**Crossfire**

Oh, *Odo*! My heart breaks for you. You see how much he adores Kira: the way he prepares every little detail for their meetings together. But he just can't muster the courage to say anything. Seeing him become more and more distracted, losing focus on his job, is a whirlwind of pain for the character. And then Quark, disguising his worry for his friend as concern for his business, gives him the best advice possible. And Odo still can't bring himself to say anything, totally understandably: he just starts trying to leave his love for Kira to the side. **9/10**

**Return to Grace**

The fascinating relationship between Kira and Dukat is furthered, as the latter learns terrorist tactics from the former in order to fight the Klingons. Again, we see Dukat's good side (his genuine love for his daughter) and his negative qualities. The way he blows up the Klingons with zero mercy, for example. Ziyal is also a superb character: so kind and gentle, and seeing her father as a good and great man at this point. **9/10**

**Sons of Mogh**

Heartfelt ending for Kurn's story. He's been a powerful presence ever since he first beamed aboard the Enterprise, and it's good to see that Worf's actions at the beginning of the season had consequences. There truly doesn't seem to be any way out for Kurn, and in the end Worf can only offer him a way that robs him of his brother. **9/10**

**Bar Association**

Ferengi episodes are usually comedies: hilarious mickey-takes of capitalism. While this episode is still very much a comedy, it is also very serious and very dark. Brunt was legitimately terrifying, as he conveyed the true viciousness of Ferengi society, in the ways he tried to crush the strike. This episode is also huge for Quark and Rom's relationship: a real rupture comes between them as Rom rejects Ferengi ideals, nearly causing his brother's death. In the end they do largely make up, although there's still an undercurrent of division. Then Rom caps off his arc for the episode: he finally breaks from his brother's shadow, and with Ferengi values, when he becomes an engineer. A masterpiece. **10/10**

**Accession**

By the Prophets, the hits just don't stop rolling! Sisko has a long-running arc of broadening his Starfleet perspective, through how his view of the Prophets changes, and in his acceptance of his role as their Emissary. Through him the audience (myself certainly) experiences an expansion of their perspective. We've always been led to believe, because we see things through a Starfleet lens, that the Wormhole Aliens are just alien entities, worshipped by the Bajorans as Gods. They have no actual connection to Bajor. But this episode gets across that they do have a connection to Bajor: they say they are 'of Bajor'. It's not saying they're definitely Gods, but it does highlight the possibility, and certainly says they're potentially a lot more than what Sisko, and we the audience, initially thought they were. And the entire reason Sisko went and saw the Prophets again was because he was concerned about the impact the 'true Emissary' was having on Bajor, which he has come to care about greatly. So... is he not demonstrating that he is becoming 'of Bajor' as well? An absolutely brilliant episode that challenged what I thought was possible when I watched it (part of DS9 turning me from atheist to agnostic), as it challenges what Sisko thinks is possible, and gets him to start accepting his role as Emissary. **10/10**

**Rules of Engagement**

Courtroom episodes are normally a good bet, and this is no exception. It's fascinating to see a Klingon who's not a warrior in the traditional sense: he knows how Klingons work, and he manipulates all their values to get a rise out of Worf. Klingons can be genius political manoeuvrers as well as soldiers. The shots they do of the crew being back in their memories, but still talking to the camera, are also cool as hell. And the eventual revelation of the Klingons' deception is amazing. **9/10**

**Hard Time**

Yes, I know it's a bit unbelievable that this never gets brought up again. But it was such an emotional experience that I couldn't help but adore it. What Miles goes through is truly traumatic, and his inability to adjust to normal life again, coupled with his flashbacks to killing his friend, are so hardgoing. The climax, after he nearly hits Molly, and then considers committing suicide because he hates what he's become, is the crowning glory of the episode. Colm Meaney absolutely shines in that final scene, and seeing our man the Chief broken like that is unbearable. Alexander Siddig also does a fine job of playing Julian calm and compassionate: he's grown up a lot and is a true friend to Miles. **10/10**

**Shattered Mirror**

The best DS9 Mirror Universe episode for sure. It uses DS9's concept as a political nexus, but for the Mirror Universe. And it couples this great compression of DS9's concept with an emotional story of Sisko and Jake having to see Jennifer die again. And I will also say that Mirror Garak being on a golden chain held by Mirror Worf is legendary. **9/10**

**The Muse**

OK, I suppose we had to have a bad one eventually. I will say that I do feel a genuine connection between Odo and Lwaxana that is quite sweet. But beyond that this episode is a disaster on both its fronts: the pregnancy storyline is contrived and hammy and adds more story for Lwaxana where none was needed after Dark Page. And the Jake storyline is just bizarre. **2/10**

**For the Cause**

An episode that does more with how complex a moral quandary the Maquis represent. You really don't want Kasidy to be helping them for Sisko's sake, but you totally understand why she does. It's a very moving story. Then we have the absolute shocker of Eddington's betrayal. He was built up as such a mild-mannered, dull character that this completely stuns you. It's an excellent twist. His parting speech about why the Federation don't understand the Maquis, because they elected to leave it, strikes a chord, even if ultimately felt angry towards Eddington. **9/10**

**To the Death**

We get our most gripping look yet at how the Jem'Hadar function as warriors: brutally but with their own sense of duty. And we see how they operate under the Vorta with the honeyed tones, Weyoun, played with malevolent relish by the amazing Jeffrey Combs. He's so polite and soft-spoken most of the time, but then you get flares of his true, vicious nature. It's a tense journey aboard the Defiant for most of the runtime, concluding in an exciting action sequence and the death of Weyoun... well, one of them. **9/10**

**The Quickening**

What a masterful episode of Star Trek. Julian has a long arc of maturing and growing up. There's no single moment where he flips from naivety to maturity, of course, but this is the closest thing. He arrogantly believes he can cure a truly horrible sci-fi disease, and ends up making things worse. But he doesn't give up: he learns humility and comes back to try even harder, with much less optimism about succeeding. When he delivers his friend's baby, and the last thing she sees is that he doesn't have the Blight... so astoundingly moving. Even if their lives remain shrouded in the threat of death, Julian gave them a beacon of hope, growing up a hell of a lot in the process. **10/10**

**Body Parts**

A second, still very comedic, but also very dark, Ferengi episode. Quark is backed into a deadly corner by Ferengi practices, but is fervently committed to proving that he is a traditional Ferengi, after all his family have shown themselves to be renegades. But in the end he realises he shouldn't go through with it, and we get a truly heavy scene where Brunt strips him of his Ferengi business licence and all his possessions. And then we get an equally uplifting scene where all his friends come in to help him rebuild. Oh, and Kira has Miles' and Keiko's second baby beamed into her womb, which is very weird but ends up a not totally useless storyline. **10/10**

**Broken Link**

Odo faces a fearsome reckoning for being the first Changeling to ever harm another. The Founders' decision to turn him into a solid, reflecting how he in their minds chose the solids over his own people, is truly harrowing for Odo, who confessed in The Die is Cast that he wanted nothing more than to be back among his own kind. Now he has been forcibly kicked out. Horrendous. And the final kicker that Gowron has been replaced by a Changeling is nothing short of a phenomenal cliffhanger. **10/10**

**Season Review**

Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I freaking LOVED this season. It is my favourite season of Star Trek so far in my rewatch. It intensifies the threat of the Dominion through Changeling infiltration, and has all the Alpha Quadrant species, from the Klingons to the Federation, scrambling in fear of this Secret Invasion. But there's also a lot more than this running thread: we get what are in my view the greatest Ferengi critiques of capitalism, that manage to be hilarious and terrifying all at once, we get Sisko's Starfleet mentality expanded as he becomes more and more 'of Bajor', and we get countless other great comedies, romance stories, and philosophical episodes. What an absolutely cracking season. **S Tier**

That's all! Thank you so so much for reading this, and please tell me your thoughts on this season! I love writing these posts and love interacting with people. As Gowron would say: Glory to you, and your House!"

How to deal with difficult government agencies,neighborsfromhell,1i9wf3g,2025-01-25 15:38:40,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1i9wf3g/how_to_deal_with_difficult_government_agencies/,Fawn-Bettina-Human,Other,"I keep reading posts where people continue to report their NFH and nothing is ever done. So, I thought I would share a technique I learned many years ago when I was in the military. I've found it to be extremely effective...

1) You have to research and know what laws or bi-laws, ordinances, rules, etc are being broken. You're not likely to get much traction if none were or you don't know.

2) Gather evidence. Keep a diary of events, NFH's actions, your actions/response, and when/who you notified. Complaints about your NFH blasting music at 2am may not get you very far. But, if you can show a video or picture of a decibel meter between a clock and glass of water with ripples in it...that's different. If you produce a doorbell video of your NFH screaming, ""Get out here, I'm gonna F--- YOU UP,"" I'll bet a court will take notice. If you complain about your neighbor ripping down your fence...include a property survey and pictures. Without evidence, it's easy for authorities to ignore you.

3) Safeguard evidence and all documents. Obtain copies of all police reports if any pertain. Keep everything in a safe place. Never release or give out your originals or last copy of something...only ever provide a copy from your files. If you think your life might be in danger, or evidence stolen/destroyed...send a copy to someone you trust in a different State or Country.

4) While you're gathering evidence, also do what you can to mitigate damages/impacts, protect yourself/others, and deescalate the situation if possible. Include this in your diary/time table.

5) Write a letter or email to the government agency having jurisdiction or a responsibility to act. Attach a copy of evidence, police reports, and diary/time table. Specify what laws were/are being broken and by whom. Include your desired outcome and expected time of resolution. You have to give the agency a reasonable amount of time to act and solve the problem, but don't give them too much or they'll forget about you. Get everything into written form...phone calls allow agencies to stall or claim they were never informed.

6) When the agency fails to act or no resolution is achieved, write them again. Shorten the time you're giving them this time. Include the previous letter(s) as Enclosure/Attachment (basically a copy of everything you sent them before). With this one, and all future letters/emails pertaining to the matter, send them with tracking (USPS Tracking works well) or return receipt. By doing this you're eliminating the possibility they can claim ignorance. AND, and this is very important, send a copy (CC) to their boss (also with tracking or return receipt). You don't need to send all the evidence to the boss (yet) as your goal at this point is to give a ""Head's up.""

7) Still no action/resolution... Write the boss! Shorten the time even more. Include a copy of all the evidence, plus previous letters. Send it out with tracking. AND, and this is very important, fill out the ""CC"" portion of the letter with the boss's boss's name...and obviously send the copy as well. Again, you don't have to send the boss's boss a copy of all the evidence...yet.

8) Start working your way up the ""Chain of Command"" or ""Food Chain"" using #6 and #7 as guides...Rinse and Repeat technique. You are creating evidence as you go...proving the lower levels were notified and failed to resolve the problem. And they can't claim they didn't know because you've got the tracking numbers that say otherwise.

9) Never complain to a lower level. For example... If your NFH is a Sheriff's Deputy, DO NOT start with your local police...go directly to Sheriff's Office Internal Affairs, State Police, State AG's Office, or even the FBI.

10) Do NOT be afraid to jump to a higher jurisdiction/person/agency when you've reached the top. Example... After reaching the Chief of Police, continue on to City Council and Mayor...or jump to State Police, State AG's Office, etc.

11) When you reach elected officials... Guess who the Mayor answers to? The Governor? Your Congressmen and Senators? Yep, they all answer to the voters! How do you notify the voters? Through your local media (TV, Radio Station, Newspaper, Internet sites, etc). It helps if elections are nearing. Even pointing out, in your letter, when one is up for re-election will get their attention. But, you'd better have good hard evidence if you reach that high, and especially before going to media.

12) I've found it's usually better to ask questions than throw accusations. Examples... **Are laws being selectively enforced? Are City Officials prejudiced against (\_\_\_\_\_)? Would you allow your children to play in this yard (see Enclosure #1)?**...#1 is picture of lawn next to fence with clumps of dog feces thrown there by NFH. **Would you consider 82dB excessive?** (Used when city ordinance #12-567 only states ""Excessive noise prohibited...""...with Enclosure picture showing reading of 82dB on meter between clock showing 12:23am and glass of water with major ripples in it). **Shouldn't I be able to feel safe walking to my car in the morning?** (Enclosure #2 is 12 pictures on two pages...obviously all taken on different days...of NFH's Pitbull, clearly off-leash, in a front yard, taking dumps next to a car.) I think you get the idea. No actual accusations were made...just questions asked...

I know this was lengthy, and I'm sorry. But, I hope you enjoyed reading it anyway and gained a valuable tool you can use when government agencies try to ignore you or stall. Often they don't want to get involved in neighbor disputes, so evidence and documentation are key.

I hope this helps..."

"It's not that things are too fast or too slow, it's that they're weirdly inconsistent",diablo4,1i9wa0v,2025-01-25 15:32:21,32,0.79,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1i9wa0v/its_not_that_things_are_too_fast_or_too_slow_its/,gunfupanda,Opinions & Discussions,"There's been a lot of discussion about the speed of various parts of Season 7. There's an ideological side of it on whether the game should be slowed down or not in various ways, but that's different from what I think most of the people complaining about are referring to.

The main issue I've been seeing in Season 7 is the speed inconsistency. 

For example it's super fast to level, get to Torment 1 or 2 level gear, and blast most of the content.

It's also fast to get enough gear to get through T4 with a decent build. I can quickly find 1-2 GA ancestrals, uniques, or even mythics. 

But then, to engage with a seasonal mechanic (occult gems) or get a specific legendary rune for my build, let alone 6 to craft a mythic unique with all of the Resplendent Shards I have, it takes orders of magnitude longer. The numbers required of these things are disconnected from the reality of playing the game in its current state. 

If everything was moving at this pace, like Path of Exile often can be with its end game mechanics, that would be one thing, but having 90% of the game be arcade blasting and ultra fast gearing to 80-90% of your character's maximum potential, and then having entire end game mechanics locked behind a multiweek grind just to engage with at all feels weird.

Again, I don't think most people are having issues with the speed, in and of itself. I think it's mostly just that the game isn't consistent with the pace you engage with it. If gearing and difficulty increase pacing was aligned with the time it takes to start engaging with the slower mechanics, I doubt it would be a problem, but that isn't how it works right now."

This shows some tremendous growth and maturity on her part."

Karlach, Wyll and Tav would have been fantastic.

Raise the cap to Level 14.

Have Avernus rigging a 'do not leave' protocol in place, rending Plane Shift, or Teleport inoperable.

Crown of Stars, Finger of Death, Forcecage, Delayed Blast Fireball, Divine Word, Firestorm, Prismatic Spray, Simulacrum, Regenerate, Conjure Celestial, Power Word: Pain,  Mordenkenians Sword are all doable in the current game without breaking it.

Have Zariel or Bel as the Big Bad would be a climatic battle. With a potential cure for Karlach and Wyll. One still has an internal heart, the other trapped as a devil.

Raphael, Hope guest staring.

Camp could actually be House of Hope.

Possibly Gale guest starring as God of Ambition or Astarion as Ascended Vampire having an alliance with Avernus mentioned. A Selunite cell breaking in etc.

In-between a quick detour into Mount Celestia would be fantastic. Maybe an 'Ascend to Mt Celestia' type arc.

Probably would be the equivalent to an additional arc.

I'd pay for that kind of content.

Today I'll be requesting a very interesting yet very popular game, Garry's Mod. It's a really popular game so you must have played it. It's a really cool sandbox where you can do pretty much anything.

I really like this game and surprise surprise, I haven't played it. I want to get this game, as it's currently on sale, but I'm extremely short on allowance. I'd love it if anyone could gift it to me. It'll mean a lot.

This game has caught my attention for a long time because of how creative and limitless it is. I've watched countless videos and streams of people building crazy contraptions, playing custom game modes, and just having a blast in the sandbox world. From Trouble in Terrorist Town to Prop Hunt, the possibilities in Garry's Mod are endless.

I've always admired how it allows people to express their creativity and have fun with friends. It feels like a game that I would deeply enjoy and spend countless hours exploring. Sadly, due to my limited allowance, I can‚Äôt afford it right now.

If anyone is willing to gift it to me, I‚Äôd be extremely grateful! I promise to cherish it and dive into the world of creativity it offers. Whether it's building, role-playing, or exploring with others, I‚Äôll make the most out of it.

Thank you for considering my request!

About the game:

Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.

You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day.

If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.

Once again, thanks for considering!

For example, we went to all you can eat sushi where you scan a QR code and order through your phone. My phone was being used by the kids, he was ordering using his. Not once did he let me pick or ask me what I wanted. He ended up over ordering things I'm not crazy about and I had no choice but to eat that. 

I told him I didn't like that, in the car later. He instantly got upset and raised his voice saying I should get over it and there's nothing he can do about it now. 

It took weeks for him to admit it was a dick move. The next time we went there he assured me I would be able to choose what I eat. It always takes time for him to admit to having done something not ok. 

We have a car with climate control. You set the temperature to what you want and that's it. In the winter he always sets it to HI which makes the car blast heat indefinitely. Before I know it I'm uncomfortable and overheated. I feel unwell when I overheat. I've asked him repeatedly to not set it to HI. 

That's what today's argument was about. We're in the car and I realize I'm not feeling well and see the temp set to HI. I say, calmly, ""Babe, you're cooking me again."" He instantly raises his voice to tell me that if I don't like the temperature I can change it myself and he doesn't want to hear about it. I push back saying he does this repeatedly despite me asking him not to its not like it's a big ask. He does the same thing with the thermostats at home because he forgets to turn them down before it gets too hot. 

After a few minutes he says he's sorry. I say it's upsetting when he dismisses my feelings and then he gets mad again that I'm still upset after he said sorry. 

I feel like he doesn't really care about upsetting me and only apologizes to get me to stop bringing it up. Worst part is our daughters see him talking to me that way. 

Am I over reacting? "

My team is premium jinhsi team with C1R1 Jinhsi(44111) , C0R1 zhehzhi and C0R0 shorekeeper.I say almost completed but mourning aix with 50% spectro res(i feel like its more than that) is tough even for jinhsi, max buffed dragon puke does like 240k dmg.

i completed almost all the difficulty 5 bosses simply by using shorekeeper concerto to outro into another char breaking a part of their vibration while occasionally doing dragon puke to charge up jinhsi forte. once the boss is down(usually at 75% health) i go all out with jinhsi and do min 730k dmg pretty much enough to bring the boss to its last legs but that didn't quite work out at higher difficulties cuz of absurd damage.

think of this as a mini guide (or not). Bosses will be ranked on the difficulty(its a relative comparision with respect to each other). I was on crit rate food(22% crit one which is taoqi speciality)

IMPERANCE HERON

difficulty:5/10

it was the relatively easy for me as compared to other bosses. Due to the stage effect the feather tornado attack does MASSIVE damage to all char. Each hit of the tornado reduces def by 15% and multiple hits shred my defense like its paper. The most important thing one must know when playing jinhsi or any mid air character is knowing which attack you are immune to, jinhsi mid air is partially immune to the tornado. The second most important thing to know is when u can fire off your dragon puke and by extension knowing their pattern. In this case imperance heron falls down after u dodge its wing strike its the best time to outro into jinhsi and unleash ur puke then outro into another char. Two back to to back outro reduce the vibration strength by a considerable chunk. Heron always does a beak attack after sucking in your char and when he flies its almost always the tornado. One way you can punish the flying is by outroing into a mid air char(like jinhsi ) and dodge all the feathers while doing damage.Imperance is easiest of the bunch because it has lower damage and you can punish it a lot more.

FELLIAN BERINGAL

difficulty:6/10

Genuinely the toughest boss for me until i realized his pattern. He got a one shot attack where he grabs you but dodging it opens a window to punish him. The random apes which throw air balls at you will almost always one shot you unless your name is shorekeeper. U MUST know when the the random apes appear cuz its actually not that random. Same idea as heron. Outro into jinhsi release the puke at low forte circuit and use ur cordinatted attacker to charge the forte. Wait for the right moment at launch ur dragon puke. This boss is the most skill based boss out of the original 4. Being at full health and dodge counters help you a lot. In the second phase where he gets on top of his stick and releases shockwaves is the best moment to punish with mid air char. Outro into jinhsi and slowly use the dragon puke and getting out ur incarnation mode before he finishes his second phase attack will most certainly kill. Its a well designed boss with a mix of skill and character strength.

TEMPEST MEMPHIS

difficulty: 8/10

Same strats as the above 2 WILL NOT WORK. This boss was the most annoying out of all of them because of his shadow. Shadow attacks somewhat randomly but most importantly it can attack while he is down so you have to look out. He got a one shot attack which is similiar to yinlin forte attack. While he is firing the beam the shadow might randomly come and do a one shot attack so NEVER panic dodge. staying calm and slowly chipping him down with dodge counters and outro vibration depletion is the way to go. It also helps that zhezhi coordinated attack takes atleast 5 % of his health everytime it procs. Its not a lot but i procced it 4 times in my fight and thats basically a 20% health reduction. Tho it does require a fast ranged attacker like shorekeeper or zhezhi herself.

CROWNLESS AND INFERNO RIDER

difficulty: 10/10

they got everything which makes a boss annoying. Strong combos , unnecessary bulk , high dmg and god forbid the second crownless takes his spear he does INSANE dmg.Inferno rider throws a bike at you and says ""parry this you filthy casual"". Jinshi mid air is broken in inferno rider fight cuz it avoids ALL of the random fire blasts which happen under your feet allowing you to safely puke. As for crownless , timing is everything. Handling him in 2nd phase is tough af so keep his vibration strength low and poise break him right after he hits his spear phase. Nuke him with your dragon puke and do as much damage as possible. i was bring him down a lot after 2 back to back dragon pukes cuz luckily i was also able to time my zhezhi ult. Inferno rider is tough but his patterns arent tough to get, its just that he is so obscenely tanky that mistakes are punishing.

MOURNING AIX

difficulty: 11/10 if you are spectro dps

50% spectro res( Basically double health if your main dps is spectro AKA jinhsi)camera is harder to fight than the boss.Higher stamina consumption for wounded char as stage effect and not a good buff.Does  ONE SHOT attack after he flies and seismic tosses you which is tough to even see cuz he is high up in the sky.Tough to dodge darts attack which one shots u. spammy beam attack which you guessed it, one shots you. No real punishing attacks. this boss takes everything bad about the inferno rider and makes it worse.

Needless to say he was nearly unbeatable for me. I was able to beat him using camellya in my alt account so i will try again after i pull the upcoming resonators who are not spectro.

At one post every couple days or so, I'll be finished around the time the paywall lifts and can then reply to comments or answer any questions people might have as they catch up on the whole season.

**RECAP**

*Episode 9*

Feng Baobao, a red backpack strapped across her chest, rides a bicycle hitched to a covered cart down the streets of Biyou Village at night. A man exiting a bar greets her and asks what she's doing up so late. Her answer that she's delivering goods makes the man laugh. She motions him closer and knocks him out, putting his unconscious body on the cart. At the village entrance, she's collected a pile of unconscious villagers that she counts before riding her way back to the village to fetch more. She's confronted by Qiu Rang, who's suspicious of her doings. Her initial blow to knock him out doesn't land, so she grabs and twists his arm, interrupting his posturing. Qiu Rang pulls away and postures some more, telling Baobao that he'll demonstrate his power to her as he reaches for his Flowing Golden Ruyi. Only to find that Baobao had pickpocketed him earlier. His attitude instantly changes, and he pleads w/Baobao to return his treasure to him since she can't use it, anyways, but Baobao simply takes off across the rooftops w/a ""come and get it"" wave of the stolen Ruyi. The two start to argue, Qiu Rang calling Baobao shameless for taking advantage of the unsuspecting and Baobao rejoining that it's his own fault for sticking the Ruyi so conspicuously in his pocket, quoting Xu Si as an authority on this, and that she's wanted this toy ever since she saw him use it. Qiu Rang is infuriated.

Somewhere in the woods, Fu Rong runs to meet up w/Ma Xianhong's other operators while Zhuge Qing tries to convince her to stay out of the coming battle. He asks whether Biyou Village is really that important to her and says the temps are not so easy to handle. Fu Rong is disappointed at his lack of care and loyalty, to which Zhuge Qing replies that it's not that he doesn't feel those emotions, but rather that he doesn't extend them to just anybody. The only one he cares for and is loyal to here is her. He holds no friendship towards the other people of the village and still doesn't know why Fu Rong came here. When she seems reluctant to tell him, he doesn't press, only adding that while you can lay down your life for causes that are worthwhile, she needs to think hard about whether there's any cause worth her life in Biyou Village. She admits that she shouldn't have expected him to get involved. Zhuge Qing clarifies that he's not unwilling to go w/her; if she's certain of her decision, he'll support her, for her sake alone. Fu Rong receives a message that the fighting has started, and the two hurry away.

They encounter Lao Meng, who's relieved he's finally found them. He says they're different from the other operators, and there are some things that must be explained in person. The temps' only targets are Ma Xianhong and Biyou Village itself. They plan to set fire to the village, driving the uninvolved villagers to evacuate; they don't intend to harm anyone who doesn't stand by Ma Xianhong's side. Fu Rong has never seen Ma Xianhong do anything save for help those in need, so how can it not be harm to destroy him and the village he worked so hard to build? Lao Meng argues that whether Ma Xianhong is good or bad doesn't matter when, in his blind self-righteousness, he's sheltering criminals like Zhao Guizhen. Fu Rong maintains that she has an obligation to defend the village that took her in when she was in desperate straits. She moves to attack the reluctant Lao Meng, who pulls out a sheaf of papers for her to peruse. Seeing Fu Rong grow more and more upset as she reads, Zhuge Qing asks her what's wrong. Lao Meng says there's nothing NDT can't uncover and tells Zhuge Qing that in those records is a side of Fu Rong he may not have seen. When she moves again to attack him, Lao Meng begins reading aloud bank transactions from his phone, each one hitting Fu Rong like a physical blow w/a comic book bang effect until Fu Rong is kneeling on the ground, buried under debt statements and loan defaults. Turns out Fu Rong spent all her money on the men she dated, who variously cheated on her w/other women or broke up w/her soon as they squeezed her dry, moving on to the next target. Lao Meng and Zhuge Qing can't help laughing a bit at all this. Zhuge Qing eventually crouches down next to a sniffling Fu Rong, telling her that love can make you crazy and lose sight of your own bottom line. She must learn to love herself a little more and not be so afraid that no one will love her in return. He adds that he finds her love-obsessed brain cute and that at least, unlike her past boyfriends, he's not after her money.

Zhuge Qing informs a politely trying to be inconspicuous Lao Meng that they surrender to NDT. Lao Meng assures them that NDT won't detain them for long if they cooperate w/the investigation. He further tells Fu Rong that NDT's evaluation of her is very good, as she never used her swordsmanship to cause trouble even under the duress of her financial problems, and that NDT's willing to discuss providing aid to pay off her debts. Zhuge Qing hugs Fu Rong to his side and is about to depart w/her when suddenly he turns around to see Wang Ye watching him. Lao Meng's normal voice is replaced by a sports announcer's tones as he narrates Wang Ye's running tackle of Zhuge Qing, who shoves Fu Rong aside. Zhuge Qing tries to tell Wang Ye that he's already surrendered, only for Wang Ye to seal his mouth w/a clod of dirt and clothesline him gleefully up into the air, then down--""KO!"" commentates Lao Meng--where he continues to punch Zhuge Qing and bash his head against the ground, yelling all the while that he's heartbroken it's come to blows, he really didn't want to do this, please don't blame him, etc. On the sidelines, Lao Meng asks Fu Rong if maybe Zhuge Qing owes Wang Ye money. Wang Ye implores Zhuge Qing to not worry about their friendship and fight back. Zhuge Qing again tries to tell Wang Ye about his surrender. Wang Ye jumps high in the air, both hands making victory signs, and steps all over Zhuge Qing, an actual shot from the donghua w/Hou Minghao's face copy-pasted on like a meme cutting in. Zhuge Qing finally gets through to Wang Ye. Who pulls him up by the arms and very disingenuously apologizes for his premature attacks against Zhuge Qing, though Zhuge Qing should have *of course* told Wang Ye about the truth of his situation sooner, which raises Zhuge Qing's ire.

The two keep swatting at each other while Lao Meng reminds them that it's best for Zhuge Qing to take Fu Rong down the mountain to where NDT reinforcements will meet them. Fu Rong is surprised that NDT is sending so many forces, and Lao Meng explains that Biyou Village must be contained before matters grow serious. Wang Ye pulls a somewhat unwilling Zhuge Qing away for a private talk. He calls Zhuge Qing a coward for surrendering soon as the going gets tough. Unfazed, Zhuge Qing suggests that as a coward, he should've been spared his beating, which Wang Ye deems a light punishment. Wang Ye goes on to admit he's actually very pleased that Zhuge Qing was able to pull back from being drawn into Ma Xianhong's troubles at the brink but wonders whether Zhuge Qing has even the slightest regret in regards to betraying Ma Xianhong, who after all treated him quite well. Zhuge Qing tells Wang Ye he need not worry that his association w/Ma Xianhong has deepened into any sort of sympathetic friendship b/c, unlike Wang Ye whose compassion is warm and understanding, Ma Xianhong disregards all propriety and never considers the feelings of others. As Zhuge Qing figures his business w/Ma Xianhong is finished after helping him perfect his furnace, Zhuge Qing can now leave w/a clear conscience. Wang Ye recalls that Zhuge Qing claims to make decisions based on his own selfish interests. Is what he came to Biyou Village seeking already his then? Zhuge Qing smiles and says that, as a sorcerer same as him, Wang Ye can go divine that.

Later, as he watches Zhuge Qing walk away w/Fu Rong, Wang Ye inwardly thinks that Zhuge Qing's changed and become much more relaxed in his own skin. Lao Meng has one last question for Zhuge Qing. Besides Qiu Rang, Zhuge Qing's the only other in the village who could've learned Divine Mechanism Converts All. Has he? Zhuge Qing denies it. Lao Meng's disappointed b/c the temps were hoping Zhuge Qing could help them dismantle Ma Xianhong's defensive formation so Zhang Chulan can locate the furnace, but Zhuge Qing returns that you don't have to know Divine Mechanism Converts All to do that. Back in the village, Baobao shouts that there's a fire, waking up the villagers, who gather outside to look around. When Qiu Rang accuses her of lying, she tells him that she'll set the fire presently and starts running across the rooftops reaching into her backpack to throw out the bottles, actually Molotov cocktails, she prepared earlier. The villagers and Qiu Rang scramble to put out the fires, but it's no use, and the whole village is soon ablaze.

Ma Xianhong views the chaos through his fly cams and orders his operators by radio to capture the temps alive, to serve as bargaining chips in negotiations w/NDT after. Chulan finds him there in the courtyard where the puppet show was held, empty stage lit red by many hanging lanterns, and once again tries to convince Ma Xianhong to back down. Ma Xianhong accuses Chulan of delaying him in conversation to buy time for his accomplices to make their moves. Chulan emotionally declares that he is trying to protect Ma Xianhong, in recognition of their grandfathers' sworn brotherhood. He begs Ma Xianhong to stay put until the battle's outcome is decided, arguing that Ma Xianhong has already done enough for Chen Duo. Ma Xianhong sits down on the courtyard steps and asks Chulan to share w/him how he and his grandfather have been these past years.

Elsewhere, Ding Zihuan, Zhong Xiaolong, and Hamuchagai are about to lead a group of villagers into the fight when suddenly Ding Zihuan is violently kneecapped, his leg twisting under him. He looks up only to get headshotted by a bullet of qi. Hei Guan runs around a corner and starts popping dudes like he's in a multiplayer FPS game; Zhong Xiaolong and Hamuchagai take cover. Zhong Xiaolong activates his X-ray vision and reports Hei Guan's position to Hamuchagai, who tackles him and holds him down. Just as Hei Guan is about to shoot Hamuchagai in the face, Zhong Xiaolong flicks out a projectile of his own--a rock, like he used against Wang Ye--and knocks off Hei Guan's forearm pipe weapon, but not before Hei Guan's shot lands, sending Hamuchagai flying into a wall. Zhong Xiaolong's follow-up shot slams Hei Guan through a door into an adjacent street.

Zhong Xiaolong is taken aback when Hei Guan stands up again unhurt from his attack. Hei Guan explains that his black pipe isn't a weapon but a training tool that siphons off some of his qi. Zhong Xiaolong has been joined by about a dozen other noob villager Outsiders, and one of them encourages the rest not to be afraid of fighting one man. They all charge at Hei Guan. Meanwhile, Ma Xianhong tells Chulan that before his great-grandfather died--that is, Ma Benzai, creator of Divine Mechanism Converts All--he only had one eye left and both his arms were broken. Ma Xianhong also personally saw his grandfather die, his left leg cut off. He comments that Chulan and his grandfather have not had an easy time of it either, and Chulan replies that people like them should cherish their present lives even more. He asks Ma Xianhong what changed recently, as when Biyou Village was first founded, its inhabitants mostly kept to themselves. Stalking Wang Ye and Zhuge Qing, sending Chen Duo to kidnap Mei Jinfeng--these are not like Ma Xianhong's usual MO. Ma Xianhong says that he just can't treat the other inheritors of the Eight Supremes as strangers.

He originally watched the Luotian Dajiao (Outsider Martial Arts Contest) for Chulan, but Chulan's behavior was so shameless--cue highlights reel--he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. At any rate, Ma Xianhong was reassured that Chulan had the protection of NDT. His attention instead turned to Wang Ye, as Fenghou Qimen's successor, and Zhuge Qing, skilled in both sorcery and qi forging. Of Jinfeng, he only says he was tasked by a person he can't refuse and Chulan shouldn't inquire further. While he admits he was seeking a sorcerer to help him perfect his furnace, he built it and Biyou Village to help others like Chen Duo. And, he adds, to help himself. Chulan seizes upon this new information, asking Ma Xianhong what's wrong w/him. Ma Xianhong only reveals that his mind is sick and that he's almost recovered, thanks to his furnace. Then he calls an end to their conversation, remarking that Chulan has done enough to delay him. He advises Chulan to not interfere in his fight w/the temps, who he's certain he can handle. As Ma Xianhong turns to leave, Chulan again stops him and this time spouts a lie about how Ma Xianhong must choose btw Chen Duo and Biyou Village, his furnace. Give up Chen Duo, Chulan begs Ma Xianhong, and keep your village and furnace. Ma Xianhong tells a sorrowing Chulan that he can't do this and prepares himself for battle, the round red beads of the bracelets he wears on both wrists splitting apart to slot into a glowing array that lines his hands and feets atop a pitch black armor. Ma Xianhong intends to keep both Chen Duo and Biyou Village. After he's out of earshot, Chulan laments that Ma Xianhong is too honest; it's *almost* embarrassing to destroy Ma Xianhong's furnace. He radios Lao Meng for an update. Zhuge Qing wonders that Chulan is so confident he'll help them but starts giving directions.

Ma Xianhong apologizes to the villagers via the speakers on his insect drones for concealing that Biyou Village was in conflict w/agents from NDT, who finally made their move tonight. As his voice-over continues that the enemy is here to capture Chen Duo for reasons he won't get into, Wang Zhenqiu knocks out another man in a street alley, gloved hand glowing pink as he draws it in a caress over the man's face. Xiao Zizai, wearing a backpack, hikes through the woods. As Xiao-*ge*, Lao Meng, Qiu'er, and Hei Guan listen in frames across the bottom, Ma Xianhong declares that he won't let them take away Chen Duo but will instead go to war against them. Chen Duo dresses, as Ma Xianhong tells the villagers this battle has nothing to do w/them and they're no match for the strength of the temps. It's his own personal choice to fight, and he's already opened the road out of the village. He implores those who don't wish to get involved to leave the battlefield w/a clear conscience. Many of the villagers run to escape, but some argue that even if they run, they'll simply fall into NDT's hands. Ma Xianhong welcomes those who remain to fight w/him. He locates Lao Meng and Qiu'er, who waves at him, by fly cam and instructs his followers to stall them until he arrives to deal w/them. Qiu Rang goes after Lao Meng by himself while sending the villagers against Qiu'er. As he's chased down the streets by a mob, Qiu'er radios that easy mode is over.

Zhao Guizhen runs through the woods, a cloth satchel slung over his shoulder, but stops when he spots Xiao Zizai waiting for him. After Xiao-*ge* kicks him to block his escape, Zhao Guizhen tells him that he won't interfere in their business w/Chen Duo. Xiao-*ge* radios that he's in position. Hei Guan confirms, an alley full of groaning people behind him. Baobao pops out of the ground, dragging w/her an unconscious Zhang Kun; she reports in, as Ma Xianhong steps into view before her. Lao Meng says he's coming as he runs down the village streets, complaining that he hasn't exercised enough recently. Qiu Rang arrives to be his sparring partner. Lao Meng summons a swarm of hornets w/a snap of his fingers that Qiu Rang sucks into one of Ma Xianhong's Pok√©balls. When Lao Meng rushes forward to attack, Qiu Rang easily blocks his strike onehanded and sends him flying back. Qiu Rang mocks that Lao Meng ought to summon some ancient guardian monster to fight him. Lao Meng laughingly asks what era they're in. Qiu Rang takes just one step forward and suddenly starts swaying on his feet, blinking his eyes and shaking his head as if to clear it.

Lao Meng, back to Qiu Rang, explains that beast tamers were indeed the laughingstocks of the Outsider world in the past b/c the conception the people of the past had of what counts as an animal was too narrow. Whereas the development of science and technology has weakened other Outsider abilities, advances in biology have greatly expanded the limits of a beast tamer's power. As Qiu Rang breaks out in hives all over his body, Lao Meng reveals that he's trained his beast taming technique to control bacteria and other microbes. One touch, and he can stimulate the microorganisms w/in your body to rapidly reproduce and even target your organs. Qiu Rang falls to the ground, convulsing. Better than calling himself a beast tamer, Lao Meng prefers to be considered a microbiology expert and poses for a hero shot, back appropriately to the explosion. Lao Meng turns to leave, embarrassed when he trips on a fallen pole.

In a standoff w/Baobao, Ma Xianhong notes that she seemingly defeated earthbender Zhang Kun in his own domain and robbed Qiu Rang of his treasured Ruyi; Chulan didn't lie to him about the temps' strength. Baobao chucks the Ruyi at Ma Xianhong, whose protective talisman blocks it automatically. He moves forward to attack as Baobao retreats, only for her to bizzarely stop and in exaggerated slow motion tell a confused Ma Xianhong to come chase her quickly, then resume running away as fast as she can. She reports that, as planned, she's very cleverly luring Ma Xianhong to the village center. Qiu'er, practically dancing through his opponents to leave them rolling on the ground in a pink haze, radios that he's in position. Back to Xiao Zizai, who tells the rest he's starting then.

Xiao-*ge* informs Zhao Guizhen that Chen Duo is of little matter to him. He does want to question Zhao Guizhen about something: a serial murder case that happened about a year ago; seven Outsider homicides that all had the same MO, no clues as to the killer. Not long after, a herb collector from Mt. Mao stole his sect's martial arts manuals, wounded a guard, and disappeared. The culprit in both these incidences was Zhao Guizhen. Who gives Xiao-*ge* a wide smile, asking if Mt. Mao wants him caught. He approaches, humbly admitting his mistake in injuring the guard, only to attack Xiao-*ge*. The two begin to fight, Xiao-*ge* running Zhao Guizhen around in a wide circle w/a barrage of golden palm strikes. One finally lands, on Zhao Guizhen's high-grade protective talisman, a string of ancient coins, which automatically activates. Zhao Guizhen draws a couple talisman runes on his hand, attacking Xiao-*ge* w/a black smoke that he quickly disperses, rushing forward to hit Zhao Guizhen in the chest. Xiao-*ge* comments that Zhao Guizhen sure has stolen many techniques.

What follows is a brief history lesson on Mt. Mao. While best known for its talisman arts, Mt. Mao's true focus is inner cultivation, practicing self-discipline and reflection towards the goal of achieving an enlightened character. (Addendum: Zheng Zibu, Lu Jin's friend and creator of Eight Supremes Infinite Heavenly Talisman from S1, was from Mt. Mao, sometimes also called the Shangqing Sect.) At some point, a bunch of *jianghu* riffraff started presenting themselves as disciples of Mt. Mao to trick the unwary. Xiao-*ge* names Zhao Guizhen a fake. Zhao Guizhen laughs. Those true disciples of Mt. Mao cultivate diligently for three years only to be rewarded w/one talisman manual while he's gained half a lifetime's worth of mastery in half a year's training. Who are they to dismiss his techniques as evil? Zhao Guizhen sheds his outer robes and shirt, all his exposed skin turning black. When he activates his power, the black surface of his skin roils w/ripples and seven monstrous heads w/glowing red eyes sprout all over his body. The heads stretch away from Zhao Guizhen to bite Xiao-*ge* and pull him closer, as Zhao Guizhen shouts in a distorted voice that he's going to eat Xiao Zizai bite by bite.

Hei Guan asks Chulan for an update. Zhuge Qing is already in place and, commenting that Ma Xianhong's still bound by the laws of heaven no matter how powerful he is, uses his Qimen Immaculate Scrutiny in conjunction w/a village-wide Wuhou Qimen array to locate Ma Xianhong's furnace. Back to Xiao Zizai vs Zhao Guizhen. Xiao-*ge* is disappointed that Zhao Guizhen is so ignorant of himself that he feels the need to rationalize his desires. Zhao Guizhen's also misunderstood him: Xiao Zizai isn't here to bring Zhao Guizhen to justice but, he says w/a beatific smile, to meet a like-minded friend. Zhao Guizhen backs away, confused. Xiao-*ge* laments how hard it is for people like them to behave normally and how lucky Zhao Guizhen was to be able to murder seven innocent people w/o getting caught, then starts ranting that instead of savoring the deaths of his victims, all Zhao Guizhen cares about is gaining power, finally screaming that Zhao Guizhen's got it all wrong. He begs, a single tear rolling down his cheek, for Zhao Guizhen to wake up. They are both perverted freaks obsessed w/death who can only dwell in the dark. If one of their kind deep down longs for the light, the only solution is to use poison to cure poison. Xiao-*ge* flashes a thoroughly unnerved Zhao Guizhen a slasher smile and tells him to accept his punishment.

He smashes Zhao Guizhen from above w/a golden hand, cracking and breaking Zhao Guizhen's protective talisman, which has reached its limits. Now scared for his life against an opponent of a type he's never faced that he's no match for, Zhao Guizhen tries to run back to the village and Ma Xianhong's protection. Xiao-*ge* yanks him back w/qi and one by one rips the monster heads from Zhao Guizhen's body. Zhao Guizhen begs Xiao-*ge* to spare him and offers as ""medicine"" three of Ma Xianhong's Pok√©balls w/villagers he'd kidnapped inside, ones that wouldn't be noticed if they went missing. Xiao-*ge*'s sickness is more advanced than his, and he promises NDT won't know if Xiao-*ge* takes these people to do as he wishes w/them.

Xiao-*ge* simply shakes his head, saying that his case is hopeless. Three years ago, a Shaolin monk tells his disciple, Xiao Zizai, to remember their agreement. (Addendum: The monk is Master Jiekong, who very briefly appeared in S1 as part of the Council of Ten Elders, though likely not the same actor.) Control your inner demon and no more killing. Xiao-*ge*, however, is worried that while his inner demon remains, he'll one day again harm the innocent. The monk encourages him to not give up, and if that day comes when he's lost to his inner demon, he's to first kill the monk. Xiao Zizai kneels to his master, leaving Shaolin. Back in Biyou Village, Zhao Guizhen is tied to a tree, gagged. Xiao-*ge* says it's a pity, but he'll hand over the villagers Zhao Guizhen kidnapped to NDT. Pulling on surgical gloves, Xiao-*ge* continues that he'll now help Zhao Guizhen eradicate the disease w/in him. Zhao Guizhen has the look of a man who's realized he's about to die a terrible death he can't escape.

*Episode 10*

Zhuge Qing directs Zhang Chulan by radio to the location of Ma Xianhong's self-cultivation furnace. Meanwhile, Feng Baobao runs from Ma Xianhong, who brings out his Soul-Shaking Bell (ÊôÉÈ≠ÇÈìÉ) that can directly attack the spirit by sound, causing temporary disorientation. It has absolutely no effect on Baobao, of course, who keeps on running to Ma Xianhong's surprise. Next, he controls three pairs of large red beads (ÂÖ≠ÂêàÁè† or Six Matches Beads) to trap Baobao in a cube that's walled in red force fields. Ma Xianhong turns to leave, assuming Baobao's imprisoned, only to stop when Baobao starts trying to break his force field cut by cut, each strike of her knife creating a long gash. He realizes she's a beginner qi forger, and her knife must be a weapon she's refined for years or it would've already broken against his. He retracts his force field beads; Baobao figures one more hit would've destroyed the barrier. Ma Xianhong pulls out another two qi weapons, and Baobao immediately books it again. He reminds himself to not underestimate the temps. Baobao dodges the force field beads and gets blown away by the attack of a flying head that resembles a traditional Chinese lion w/thin dragonfly-like wings (Á©∫Âì≠Âêº or Crying Air Howler), hurting her arm.

Ma Xianhong tires of this game of chase, Baobao neither fighting nor fleeing. A sitting Baobao answers that she has no choice b/c the temps all agreed to not fight Ma Xianhong and lead him to the village center, if they encountered him. Just as Ma Xianhong directs his Air Howler to blast Baobao again, a villager's body is thrown btw the two to shield Baobao. Hei Guan steps out of the woods, telling Ma Xianhong he doesn't need to hunt them down one by one--they're all here. A large group of villagers charge in from behind Ma Xianhong to aid him, but a staff flies through the air to bar their way, Qiu'er arriving soon after, eyes aglow w/streaking flame, to kick them back. From his running spin around his staff, Qiu'er uses it as a springboard to engage Ma Xianhong in close quarters. Hei Guan leaps in to join the fray after Ma Xianhong kicks Qiu'er away. Ma Xianhong controls his hover ball qi weapon (ÁõóÂëëÂÖΩ or Devouring Thief Beast), black w/a glowing red center, to face Hei Guan; it opens and begins drawing in his qi. Hei Guan hastily kicks off it and retreats to Qiu'er, the two men in front of and on either side of Baobao.

Hei Guan notes that the closer you are, the faster the hover ball can vacuum your qi away. Qiu'er, who sounds like he's in a Peking opera, asks after Baobao's arm; she replies that it's fine, her bone fractures already healing. Inwardly, Ma Xianhong is impressed by how quickly Hei Guan reacted. Baobao wonders what happened to their agreement to fight Ma Xianhong in the village center; Hei Guan visibly winces while Qiu'er tells Baobao to be more flexible. The noob villager Outsiders rush up to help Ma Xianhong. Hei Guan nonchalantly breaks one man's leg w/a stomp, prompting Ma Xianhong to order the rest to fall back. Liu Dang declares that they're not afraid. On the other side, Qiu'er reminds Hei Guan of their orders. Hei Guan clarifies that while they're not permitted to kill the villagers--who can't hurt them but can exhaust them--crippling the villagers to teach them a painful lesson they'll remember for life is fine, and Baobao agrees. Qiu'er draws a gloved hand down his face, his Nezha makeup clearing, saying that he's naturally playful and it isn't his style to cause people pain. Ma Xianhong names this technique Divinity Mask (Á•ûÊ†ºÈù¢ÂÖ∑).

Flashback to a week ago at Mei Jinfeng's house, where Xia Liuqing sits across a table from Qiu'er teaching him how to use the glove. Qiu'er can't get a reaction from the glove and wonders if it can truly summon a god. Xia Liuqing explains that gods are created by men, specifically mankind's collective belief, which some see as a divine power, though Xia Liuqing prefers to call it the power of faith. Ancient Outsiders performed ritualistic dances to inspire awe and other emotions in the audience that they then distilled into power; passed down through the generations, these rituals eventually became theatrical productions, and the gathered power was imbued into objects like the glove. When activated correctly, the glove will release its power as a performance, transforming its wearer to embody a god. The possibilities are limitless given the right mindset. Xia Liuqing asks Qiu'er if he's capable.

Back in Biyou Village, Qiu'er dons a new mask, the Monkey King by his fiery phoenix feather headpiece. He thanks Ma Xianhong for inspiring in him the sense of righteousness needed to play this role and vows to show Ma Xianhong what a true god looks like. The noob villager Outsiders ignore Ma Xianhong's order to retreat, charge in, and are promptly wiped out by one sweep of Wang Zhenqiu's now extendable staff, sent tumbling back to fall at Ma Xianhong's feet, groaning in pain. Qiu'er does his best Sun Wukong impression, asking if Ma Xianhong will admit his mistake. The temps, Ma Xianhong's operators, and Ma Xianhong himself trained their Outsider abilities through years of due diligence and hardship that most people cannot imagine or withstand. By making the villagers into noob Outsiders overnight, Ma Xianhong let them achieve power w/o effort, and thus they've lost touch w/reality, growing arrogant and reckless. These people are not Outsiders, Qiu'er judges, but clueless tourists LARPing in the Outsider world. The villagers are about to rush Qiu'er again, who spins his staff rapidly in one hand behind him, when Ma Xianhong shouts for them to stop. Hei Guan calls Ma Xianhong an idiot; these noobs are as much in his way as they're in the temps'. Ma Xianhong admits his mistake and tells the villagers they have no place in this battle. He implores all of them to leave now.

Liu Dang and the others still refuse to back down. Liu Dang says that, thanks to Ma Xianhong, he can enjoy his first battle as an Outsider. His pride and honor as an Outsider is on the line, and even if he fails, he at least won't regret missing this opportunity. The other villagers all chime in to agree, not caring about NDT or why they're fighting, only seeking the thrill of battle. Hei Guan comments that this is a headache while Ma Xianhong looks like he regrets a great many things. Suddenly, from behind the villagers comes Xiao Zizai's voice, wondering what's going on. Xiao-*ge* drags by the strap a black backpack on the ground behind him. The temps didn't come here to fight a bunch of noobs, he continues. While HQ has ordered them to capture the villager Outsiders alive, those who can risk their lives w/unshakeable resolve are very much to his tastes. Key point being that they must choose to stay while calm and after having rationally assessed the situation. Hotheaded fools are not worth him being held accountable for their deaths. He gives the villagers five seconds to think things over, tossing over the backpack. A villager opens it and one of Zhao Guizhen's monster heads explodes out. Xiao-*ge* emphasizes that he will kill the villagers should they remain. Ma Xianhong, enraged, commands the villagers again to leave and this time is obeyed; he faces down the gathered temps alone.

Check-in on Chulan, who's wandering the fields suspecting Zhuge Qing of playing him. Zhuge Qing tells him to be patient, then spouts a whole paragraph of Qimen magitechnobabble, the gist of which (I *think*) is that he's sent Chulan to a location where he'll be able to find the furnace once the dials align in a certain way w/the passage of time. Back to Ma Xianhong vs Baobao, Hei Guan, Qiu'er, and Xiao-*ge*. Xiao-*ge* tells Ma Xianhong not to be angry; his other operators are fine, and Zhao Guizhen deserved death. Ma Xianhong has finally realized the temps are not just here for Chen Duo. Aaanddd **FIGHT!** The four temps run in together, dodging the Air Howler and force field beads. Qiu'er blows some qi hairs and makes three flying copies of himself to pull the hover ball to one side. Baobao closes and exchanges blows w/Ma Xianhong, then trades w/Qiu'er who does the same, before being blown back by the Soul-Shaking Bell. Hei Guan knocks aside Ma Xianhong's hand that's holding the bell and Xiao-*ge* hits Ma Xianhong in the chest, sending him straight to Baobao, who cuts the bell cleanly off its handle. During the pause as everyone repositions, Qiu'er inwardly savors the feeling of such smooth cooperation. Ma Xianhong, OTOH, is questioning why the temps are so steady, even holding back, and guesses that they must have a purpose, for instance to stall him.

When Ma Xianhong accuses the five temps of targeting Biyou Village from the start, Hei Guan wonders that Ma Xianhong still hasn't caught on to the fact that Chulan is one of them. Baobao corrects Hei Guan that there are actually seven of them, to his ire. Hei Guan then lays it out for Ma Xianhong: the villagers have been taken care of and they're here fighting Ma Xianhong, so what is Chulan doing? Back in the temps' strategy meeting, Hei Guan tells Chulan his first task is to stall Ma Xianhong. Chen Duo serves as blind for Ma Xianhong, diverting him from the temps' true goal of destroying Biyou Village. Before Ma Xianhong realizes this, they have to neutralize as many of the villagers and Ma Xianhong's operators as they can, at the same time wrecking the village. This will anger Ma Xianhong and keep him from thinking straight, allowing Chulan a chance at the furnace. However, while Chulan completes his second task, the other temps will be facing Ma Xianhong and the combined forces of Biyou Village, among which are the noob villager Outsiders whose lives must be spared.

Baobao interrupts to say there's no need to waste so much effort when she can just clock Ma Xianhong in his sleep, to the amusement of Qiu'er. Hei Guan is less amused and warns Chulan to watch Baobao. After Chulan tells Baobao she shouldn't spend her time on trivial things like planning, Hei Guan adds that all she needs to remember is to knock out villagers, set the village on fire, and lure Ma Xianhong to the village center so they can gang up on him together. Chulan asks what to do if Ma Xianhong discovers him while he's destroying the furnace. Hei Guan explains that he has to wait until the rest of them have engaged Ma Xianhong in combat. If they can defeat Ma Xianhong quickly, that would be best, but if not, they'll reveal Chulan's target and split Ma Xianhong's attention further, hurrying him back to his furnace while the temps harry him.

Zhuge Qing's meeting resistance in revealing the furnace to Chulan and lights up his Qimen array w/Samadhi True Fire. Finally, in the open field before Chulan, Ma Xianhong's self-cultivation furnace breaks out of the ground, rising maybe four to six stories into the night sky in a shower of dust and rocks. Zhuge Qing says his job is done, and he's going to find Fu Rong and will meet Chulan outside Biyou Village. He wishes Chulan good luck. His last delivery is a hammer he drops out of the sky, wreathed in lightning--a present from Baobao. Hammer over his shoulder, Chulan enters the furnace, amazed by it. He remembers Zhuge Qing's advice that brute force can't destroy the furnace and walks to the control box on the left side. Activating his lightning technique, he swings the hammer faster and faster over his head, then brings it down.

Ma Xianhong, however, doesn't seem overly concerned that Chulan may have found his furnace and plans to destroy it. Just as Chulan's about to strike the furnace control box, **Black Puppet**, Ma Xianhong's most powerful android creation, kicks him away. Black Puppet is imbued w/the techniques of three Outsiders: Ding Zihuan's Phantom Walk (ËØ°ÂΩ±Ë°å), which hides its presence, (Bi Yuan's) Devious Needle (ËØ°Èó®Èíà), a medical acupuncture art, and Chen Duo's Primordial Poison (ÂéüÂßãÊØí), though not as potent. In his fight w/Black Puppet, Chulan has trouble tracking its movements, and while he wards off a needle strike to the back of his neck w/Golden Light Mantra, Black Puppet spews a cloud of poison at Chulan as he pulls away that he breathes in. As the poison attacks his body, Chulan collapses on the floor. Baobao tries to contact Chulan, but there's no response. Hei Guan, in hand-to-hand w/Ma Xianhong, asks what Ma Xianhong did to Chulan; Ma Xianhong answers that Chulan brought his death upon himself. Ma Xianhong continues to fight the temps, Xiao Zizai landing a golden palm smash on him from above that cracks his protective talisman, a necklace w/three golden oval beads strung together. One of the beads cracks, too, but heals over again, the protective crystal doing the same.

Back at the furnace, the power Zhang Huaiyi/Xilin passed to Baobao and Baobao to Chulan activates as Chulan lies dying. Past Chulan complains to Baobao that this Old Farmer's Technique (ËÄÅÂÜúÂäü) his grandfather gave him doesn't make any sense. There are no instructions on how to train and in fact no description of what it even does. Furthermore, as he practices, Chulan's belly is growing and he can feel movement w/in, increasing in strength and frequency. Baobao naturally concludes that Chulan is pregnant. A ball of qi inside Chulan's body begins absorbing Chen Duo's poison, changing into the shape of a baby that projects outward until it completely covers Chulan, open eyes and mouth glowing blue. It lets out a low-pitched cry, shockwaves spreading rhythmically outwards from it across all of Biyou Village, eventually reaching Ma Xianhong where he's surrounded by the temps. Sensing something's amiss, Ma Xianhong takes off running towards his furnace, the temps immediately giving chase.

Baobao throws her knife at Ma Xianhong, only for it to spin back around and attack her. Hei Guan warns that Ma Xianhong has already gained control over Baobao's knife during the course of their battle and that any non-living object could have been made into his weapon. As Hei Guan talks, Ma Xianhong manipulates the threads of his shirt to pierce through his vest over his heart. Hei Guan falls to his knees and over onto the ground. The other three glance at him but don't stop their pursuit of Ma Xianhong. Meanwhile, the qi baby, in control of an unconscious Chulan's body, gazes curiously at the self-cultivation furnace. It rises unsteadily to its feet and activates Golden Light Mantra, cooing in wonder, then Yang Five Lightning, streams of lightning coming from each finger. It giggles as it sends lightning everywhere. Black Puppet tries to attack it, only to be sent flying w/the touch of a single fingertip.

It latches onto Black Puppet, still giggling, and doesn't so much as fight Black Puppet as play around w/it. Black Puppet again spews poison at Chulan. The qi baby absorbs the poison unharmed and lets out the low-pitched cry from earlier, lightning pulsing in shockwaves, too, to strike Black Puppet and the entire furnace. Encased in the qi baby w/in his own body, Chulan can't move and has no idea what's happening. Ma Xianhong runs through the fields to w/in sight of his furnace, but it's too late. Inside, lightning forks all over the place, destroying the furnace, while outside the whole klin collapses in a fiery explosion, leaving behind a giant pile of rubble. A stunned Ma Xianhong can only say to himself that his furnace has been shattered.

If I have an operative on Vantage that is shooting with a Blast weapon into a Concealed operative behind Light Terrain, does the improved cover save from Vantage terrain that the primary target receives apply to the secondary blast targets as well? And does the secondary target being on engage or not in cover affect this? 

For example in Scenario A, the secondary blast target is also concealed and behind the same Light cover as the primary target, but the cover is not intervening between the primary and secondary targets, does the secondary target still receive improved cover from vantage as visibility is drawn from the primary target, which is not on vantage? 

In scenario B, the secondary blast target is on engage order and out in the open with no cover. Would the secondary target  receive the benefits of improved cover save from vantage?

As far as I know, obscuring from the primary target applies to the secondary targets as well but I‚Äôm not sure if improved cover saves apply the same way."

I also have my guitar running through an ms70cdr and a couple other pedals. The problem i keep running into is whether i should have the end of the chain be the mixer or have the mixer end at the 404mk2

 big pros of having end of mk2
-I really need master fx for transitioning between songs, i often blast delays and phasers at the end of songs 
-gives the 2 synth modules some extra effects because other than the onboard effects of the mixer i dont have much else. I do have those cheap behringer multi-fx pedals for them but thats it

Big cons of mk2 at end of chain
- makes the Mk2 basically rendered to just an effects box. I can do a bit of running samples through it but very limited as i cant fade out samples if its not going through the mixer because everything is running through it
-The workflow is so much easier and smoother on the mk2. I do most of the sequencing Keystep pro but editing samples goes so much quicker with it and it would open up another big option for samples instead of sequencing all the samples on one midi channel (the 404a) 

What do you guys think?
Feel free to ask questions and to criticize the shit out of me.

Also ik getting a digitakt would be an answer but i really want to make it work with what i got. Thats part of the art aint it?


I also considered having the 404a be the end of the chain but no usb so i cant record into my phone easily, and only one effect at a time.

So now i just sold my 4090 and will be receiving my 5090 next thursday ( 30jan ). The 4090 gave me enough to power to drive 4k games in ultra at 80-130fps very effectively and now with the additional power of the 5090 the 120hz refresh rate of my c2 worries me a bit as i could go upwards 200fps on the 5090 in many games. 

So what are my options ? I know LG c5 is coming and with 144hz and also the LH b5 with 165hz but only in a 48‚Äù wich is on the bigger size as i am used to 42‚Äù and also will probably be around 3500$ here in Iceland ( everything is very expensive here ) 

And 32‚Äù 4k Oled 240hz from MSI, asus or on the market but i want something a bit bigger since im used to 32‚Äù and i dont want the matt finish.

Repulsor Metamorphosis,CTsandbox,1i9v9vq,2025-01-25 14:47:48,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/1i9v9vq/repulsor_metamorphosis/,Zealousideal_Lab8117,Cursed technique ,"This technique allows the user to transform parts of their body into CE-fueled repulsion engines. These engines generate powerful bursts of force and momentum, allowing for enhanced speed, flight-like movement, and devastating shockwave-based attacks. The repulsion force can be focused through specific limbs, such as the hands, feet, or even the back, to propel the user in any direction or launch high-impact strikes that amplify physical force. Unlike traditional energy blasts, these engines work by expelling CE in bursts that create repulsive force, pushing against the surrounding environment or the user‚Äôs own body.

The user can activate repulsor engines in their arms or legs to deliver explosive punches and kicks, generating enough kinetic energy to shatter defenses and send opponents flying. By activating engines on their back or feet, the user can achieve extreme aerial maneuverability, dashing through the air at high speeds while adjusting their trajectory mid-flight. Additionally, the technique can generate continuous shockwaves around the body for defensive purposes, repelling incoming projectiles or enemies with an outward blast of force.

The repulsor engines are not limited to propulsion alone; they can also be used to create destructive pressure fields. By releasing CE in rapid, concentrated bursts, the user can generate localized gravitational pushes that distort space around them, repelling everything within a certain radius. This makes it possible to neutralize melee attacks or even redirect energy-based techniques by overwhelming their momentum with repulsive force.




The technique‚Äôs power depends on how much CE is channeled into the repulsor engines. Simple propulsion requires minimal energy, but generating high-speed flight or powerful repulsive bursts consumes significantly more CE, quickly depleting reserves if overused. The intense kinetic recoil from repulsor-enhanced attacks places tremendous strain on the user‚Äôs muscles, bones, and joints. Continuous use without proper control can cause severe injuries, such as torn ligaments, fractures, or internal damage.

Activating the engines requires precise timing and CE manipulation. Misjudging the force output or direction can lead to unintended collisions or loss of control, leaving the user vulnerable. Each activation of a repulsor engine produces force in a single, linear direction. Rapid adjustments require multiple bursts, making it difficult to maintain stability in crowded or unpredictable environments.

If too much CE is released in a single burst, the repulsor engine may explode with destructive force, damaging the user as well as their surroundings. This risk increases when using full-body propulsion or attempting large-scale shockwave generation. Techniques that can absorb kinetic energy or CE greatly reduce the effectiveness of this technique, as they counter the outward blasts of repulsion directly.





Extension Techniques:


Blast Step: Propels the user forward with a short, high-speed burst, enabling rapid dashes that leave afterimages to confuse enemies.

Breakthrough Fist: Enhances a punch with a concentrated repulsor engine burst, delivering an impact that creates a shockwave upon contact, capable of shattering barriers.

Repulsion Overdrive: Charges the repulsor engines for a continuous burst of CE, allowing for sustained propulsion rather than short bursts.

Concussive Palm: Generates a wide-area shockwave from the user‚Äôs palms, sending multiple enemies flying in a cone-shaped blast.





Cursed Technique Reversal:


Compression Engines: The user generates inward-pulling forces instead of outward blasts. This allows them to pull enemies or objects toward themselves at high speeds, enabling devastating close-range grapples or compression-based attacks. For example, pulling an enemy into a compression punch concentrates kinetic energy into a single point for bone-crushing force.





Domain Expansion:


Endless Recoil: The domain manifests as a massive, mechanical expanse filled with rotating repulsor engines.


Every action within the domain is subjected to continuous bursts of repulsion, pushing enemies away from the user and destabilizing their movements. The user‚Äôs repulsor engines operate at peak efficiency, allowing for limitless bursts of propulsion without energy drain for the duration of the domain.

All physical strikes or movements within the domain generate secondary shockwaves, making even minor actions produce destructive force. The user can create localized repulsion fields that push objects or enemies into spiraling trajectories, disorienting them and rendering their attacks ineffective.

Opponents are trapped in an inescapable vortex of kinetic force, continuously pushed, bounced, and thrown around the domain until it ends."

Getting Back Into Karting After 32 Years: Advice on LO206 and Chassis Setup?,Karting,1i9v6e3,2025-01-25 14:43:24,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Karting/comments/1i9v6e3/getting_back_into_karting_after_32_years_advice/,Junior_Hearing7486,Karting Question,"Title: Getting Back Into Karting After 32 Years: Advice on LO206 and Chassis Setup?

Hey everyone,

My 17-year-old son recently got his hands on an old Mitox Tony kart chassis with a Komet K71 piston port motor. He‚Äôs had two sessions with it at Adam‚Äôs, and unfortunately, on the second weekend, we stuck the motor pretty badly. I‚Äôm pretty sure the issue was weak, old rings, as the temp only hit 300¬∞. Back in the early ‚Äò90s, I ran a K71 motor, and we‚Äôd push 330-340¬∞ all the time without issues. For reference, we were running 25:1 on the oil-to-fuel ratio.

Rather than dumping money into fixing the K71 (which isn‚Äôt really raceable anywhere in SoCal these days), we‚Äôre looking into switching to an LO206 motor. The plan is to practice with it this year, learn the ropes, and enter some races next season. I‚Äôve been out of the game since I stopped racing in 1993, and I only ever ran two-strokes, so this is new territory for me as well.

We found an LO206 motor package on Point Racing‚Äôs website for $1,400 that comes with everything needed. Is that a reasonable price? If there are better deals or reputable vendors in SoCal, let me know.

As for the Mitox chassis, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll work as a short-term solution until we upgrade to a new chassis in the second or third season of racing with the LO206. Do you guys think this chassis will hold up? Also, does the LO206 on a Hoosier R70 tire benefit from a stiff or more flexible chassis? Back in the day, I ran a KT100 in the Sportsman‚Äôs class, and we‚Äôd always try to avoid binding the chassis on Bridgestone YBN tires. Is the same level of frame flex important for a low-power LO206 setup?

Lastly, the axle on the Mitox is massive‚Äîlooks like a 50mm (haven‚Äôt measured yet). It‚Äôs way bigger than anything I ran in the early ‚Äò90s. Is a big axle like this suitable for an LO206, or should we consider a swap?

It‚Äôs been a blast getting back into karting after 32 years and seeing my son so excited about it too. If you‚Äôve got any advice, recommendations, or SoCal contacts for us, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thanks for helping us out as we transition into this new chapter of karting!

Cheers,
A dad rediscovering karting with his son"

(With back context) why does it seem like everyone hates Kushala Daora? I just recently started playing world.
My friend wanted me to play forever ago. But wasn't fun (he carried a lot of low rank) I ended up stopping and came back on a whim. Played all of low and high rank solo excluding a few hunts that I went back to solo. Now I'm loving it! Beat iceborne and doing guiding lands and having a blast still. I started seeing more content and posts everywhere about how much people hate Kushala Daora gets and I gotta say I don't get it. I enjoy the fight a ton!
So I guess my question is why do you hate it?

Edit: I use dual blades have fought him in master rank a few times now have not fought him in guiding lands yet "
Sanding instead of sandblasting,Cerakote,1i9uzn0,2025-01-25 14:35:18,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cerakote/comments/1i9uzn0/sanding_instead_of_sandblasting/,mediocre_sysadmin,,"I know that the recommendation/requirement is blasting with #100 aluminum oxide, and that is not an issue for our shop. However, I have a couple of older lawn chairs that my parents are looking to get coated just to get them looking new again, and the frame of the chairs are too big to fit into our blast cabinet. Again, I know that blasting is the way, but has anyone used other methods to prep surfaces for coating that has worked well enough? Not trying to have these be feature pieces of our work, just get them rust free and usable again so they can sit in the backyard.

  
If there is no semi-reliable way, then so be it, but figured I would ask the community first."
"Since John Cena is going for big number 17, where did Flair's 16 number even come from?",GreatnessOfWrestling,1i9uzm7,2025-01-25 14:35:16,8,0.83,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatnessOfWrestling/comments/1i9uzm7/since_john_cena_is_going_for_big_number_17_where/,Gullit-Gang,:GOW: Pro Wrestling History,"Get ready, this is a bit of a long one. I'll try to go through each of Ric Flair's reigns to see how many are actually legit, and how many were unfairly disqualified. Note that I'll only bring up dubious wins for the most part if there's something interesting to say about them.


/


On September 17th of '81, Flair won in a one on one match to win the 10lbs of gold. This one's pretty clear, it's legit and we can add one to the tally. (1 NWA, 1 TOTAL)


/


Dusty Rhodes wearing a mask beat Ric Flair for the belt, but was disqualified by the NWA president, the title was then returned to Flair. This is our first taste of what I'd consider an illegitimate championship win. (1 NWA, 1 TOTAL)


/


There are a few dubious reigns throughout 1982 and '83 that even the NWA don't recognize, I won't either. (1 NWA, 1 TOTAL)


/


Flair beat Harley Race in a steel cage at Starrcade, this one's clean. (2 NWA, 2 TOTAL)


/


Flair apparently wins the title again over Harley in Singapore of all places. Recognition is spotty from the NWA and the title change was not officially authorized, plus the match may be a straight up lie, I'm leaving it off. (2 NWA, 2 TOTAL)


/


Flair became the first champion in the history of Jim Crockett promotions, and held the belt for over two years, pretty conclusive. (3 NWA, 3 TOTAL)


/


Flair wins the title again in St Louis, holds it for over a year, you know the drill. (4 NWA, 4 TOTAL)


/


Flair wins two more under the WCW banner, at Starrcade and WrestleWar. Keep in mind though this is still the NWA title we're talking about (6 NWA, 6 TOTAL)


/


Flair won the title at a house show, lost to Tatsumi Fujinami at the Tokyo dome, and then won it back at the first Superbrawl. This change was ignored at the time and so some people would argue this is one reign. I'm going to make a judgement call that because he lost a title match at an official WCW event, that this counts for two, sue me. This was also the first time he was recognized as WCW champion, but since they were still part of the NWA, I'm counting these as NWA wins. We should still get the same total at the end. (8 NWA, 8 TOTAL)


/


Ric Flair was then stripped of the belt as he left for the WWF, while there he won the Rumble for a vacant WWF championship, as well as one more win on an episode of Primetime Wrestling. (8 NWA, 2 WWF, 10 TOTAL)


/


Richard came back to WCW and won one more at Beach Blast before WCW left the NWA, going off my previous call, I'm adding one to the NWA tally to get his commonly recognized 9. (9 NWA, 2 WWF, 10 TOTAL)


/


Ric Flair, now in the ""True"" WCW era became the first ever champion at Starrcade 10th anniversary. He then faced Steamboat for the title which ended in a double pinfall, as per WCW rules, the title was vacated and Ric Flair ended up winning it back regardless. Given that it was their rules, and that Flair won a match as the challenger to an official vacant title, I'm counting two reigns. (9 NWA, 2 WCW, 2 WWF, 13 TOTAL)


/


Flair then won another 4 WCW titles in fairly non controversial fashion (which is as good as you can hope for in late era WCW). So yes, I'm putting him above the touted 16. (9 NWA, 6 WCW, 2 WWF, 17 TOTAL)


/


Flair was, get this, *handed the belt* by Kevin Nash. I would have no problem with this if he was able to defend it. He lost to Jeff Jarrett that same night on nitro, no chance I'm counting this.


/


That puts us at a final tally of 17 World Championships, so if John Cena wants to have the most, he needs two more of those shiny title victories. But at this point, I'll be counting it even if he wins one, because it truly hurts me to include a title won as a result of the fricking finger poke of doom as ""legit""




TLDR: 17, give or take"

The Bingo challenge is always a highlight of April for me - it's fun, always surprising, and gives me an excuse to shake up my TBR. This is my eighth card, and I‚Äôm already looking forward to the next one.

# Bingo 2024: Difficulty

Okay, I know this is subjective, but I found this year‚Äôs Bingo to be the easiest one yet. Most of the squares ""slotted"" into my reading naturally, and only two (Bards, Published in 1990s) required some actual research. One of those books turned out to be amazing; the other‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt.

# Favorite Squares

* ***Judge a Book by Its Cover***: Super fun square! Plus, I picked a brilliant book for it, but your mileage may vary and perhaps I was just lucky.
* ***Eldritch Creatures:*** I love horror, so this was right up my alley.
* ***Small Town***: Something about cozy (or creepy) small-town vibes always hooks me.
* **Survival:** Who doesn‚Äôt love a good survival story?

# Least Favorite Squares

* ***Book Club/Readalong:*** Ironically, I lead a book club, yet this square always feels like a chore. Why? It gives less room for personal choice, and yes, I know I'm being irrational. The database of eligible books is massive. But I can't help it - it makes me feel it's a closed set and I like to have freedom :P Irrational, as mentioned. Happily, the book I picked for it is one of my favorite books read in 2024.
* ***The Bard***: Surprisingly, bards aren't that easy to find nowadays. The book I picked for this square was the weakest thing I read all year, but that‚Äôs on me. I could‚Äôve done a better research.
* ***Romantasy:*** Look, I‚Äôm not a romance reader, so this square was always going to be a slog for me. I prefer my books dark, gritty, and romance-free. Fortunately, the book that happens to meet the criteria of the square is excellent, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

# BOOKS & MINI-REVIEWS

Here are my mini-reviews for each square. Most of these are shortened versions of my Goodreads reviews. Ideally, my Bingo card would feature only books I rated 4 stars or higher, but some squares make that tricky. If you have any recommendations for the trickier squares, hit me up - I want my card to represent the *best* books (that fit bingo squares) I read during the Bingo period.

[ROW 1](https://preview.redd.it/lmwqkenls6fe1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ef76398893292b50ce10c315c151cb28b87ab4)

# Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey

**First in a Series (HM);** *also* *Criminals, Under the Surface, Dreams, Multi-POV. Space Opera*

**Rating**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

Confession time: I liked the TV series more. But that aside, this was still a great read. It‚Äôs epic but with a tight focus on personal stakes and well-rounded characters. The story is immersive, the ideas are clever, and there‚Äôs a reason this one‚Äôs a modern sci-fi classic.

# The Book That Broke The World by Mark Lawrence

**Alliterative Title (HM)**; *also Romantasy (I think), Dark Academia (probably), Under The Surface*

**Rating**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

Mark Lawrence really knows how to keep you hooked. This sequel is darker, faster-paced, and full of surprises. The multiple POVs and time jumps were cool. Livira and Malar‚Äôs struggles hit hard, and the insectoid enemies are creepy af.

# Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi

**Under the Surface**; also ¬†*First in a series, Dreams, Character with a Disability, Survival, Published in 2024*

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Political intrigue? Check. Deeply personal stakes? Double check. Scheming Machiavellian side characters? Oh, yes. Navola delivers all this and more. Bacigalupi shifts from heartfelt moments to bursts of calculated violence and an overwhelming sense of bleakness with ease and perfect timing, and I savored every second of it. My favorite book of 2024.

# Dig Two Graves by Craig Schaefer

**Criminals (HM)**; *also Self Published, published in 2024*

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

As a massive fan of the Daniel Faust series, I might be biased, but this was fantastic. Sharp writing, morally grey characters, and an addictive plot made it one of my favorites.

# The Dream Master by Roger Zelazny

**Dreams (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

The Dream Master holds well despite being almost 60 years old. It has an outstanding premise - Charles Render specializes in neuroparticipation. Basically, he creates and controls/constructs dreams of his patients to get an insight into their neuroses and problems. Render takes on a patient with congenital blindness and a hunger for visual stimuli.

# Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boule

**Entitled Animals (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

I saw at least two *Planet of the Apes* movies and enjoyed them. The story itself is immersive and action-packed, but some of the social dynamics haven‚Äôt aged well. Still, it‚Äôs an entertaining classic that I‚Äôm glad I read.

# Bard Tidings by Paul Regnier

**Bards (HM)**, also self-published

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Fully predictable and instantly forgettable. The weakest book on my Bingo card. I picked it on a whim from Kindle Unlimited, and, well‚Ä¶ mistakes were made.

# The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk

**Prologues/Epilogues;**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

The Empusium is a strange, slow, and fascinating book. It‚Äôs part gothic horror, part social critique, and part... well, something that doesn‚Äôt really fit into any category. Call it Weirdlit, if you need to. Anyway, if you‚Äôre looking for fast-paced thrills and gruesome horrors, this isn‚Äôt it. But if you enjoy well-written and unsettling books with elegant and plastic prose you‚Äôre in for a treat.

# Thrill Switch by Tim Hawken

**Self Published**;

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

A cyberpunk thriller that pulls no punches. Brutal but brilliant.

# Fool's Promise by Angela Boord

**Romantasy (HM)**; also Dreams, Self-Published, Disabled (HM)

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

Fool‚Äôs Promise is a brilliant sequel that not only lives up to the high expectations set by the Fortune‚Äôs Fool but surpasses them in many ways. The story picks up some time after where the previous installment left off, and gets more complex, more twisted, and more thrilling.

[ROW 3](https://preview.redd.it/g1ertdfmt6fe1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e388e44e6fa07c161894a1c72e112913eb7e92)

# The Young Elites by Marie Lu

**Dark Academia (HM)**; also disabled, POC author

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

The Young Elites follows Adelina Amouteru, a young girl who survived a blood plague that gave her superpowers and a rather grim outlook on life. It‚Äôs a dark story filled with magic, darkness, and more teenage angst than I‚Äôve consumed in any form of media in recent months :) Anyway, if you‚Äôre into brooding anti-heroes and dramatic twists, it will probably be right up your alley.

# The Devil By Name by Keith Rosson

**Multi-POV (HM)**;

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

The Devil by Name picks up five years after *Fever House* with all the chaos, gore, and gripping drama you‚Äôd expect‚Äîand then some. The world is still reeling from ‚ÄúThe Message,‚Äù a weaponized sound that turned much of humanity into bloodthirsty monsters called the fevered. With Terradyne Industries running the show and humanity clinging to survival, the stakes have never been higher.

# Saturation Point by Adrian Tchaikovsky

**Published in 2024 (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Adrian Tchaikovsky functions at a level of productivity most of us can only envy. A good thing for us, readers. I always thought he excelled at a novella format and Saturation Point proves my point. Fans of a climate apocalypse and existential dread - here‚Äôs your next fix.

# Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor

**Disability (HM)**; also First in a Series

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

*Death of the Author* walks a fine line between literary fiction and Africanfuturism. It‚Äôs also a nice example of the book-within-a-book format; we follow the events through Zelu‚Äôs life and excerpts from her sci-fi book. I liked how Okorafor shifted between the two genres. And I loved the surprising ending that connected both parts extremely well. But, you know, spoilers.

# The Prestige by Christopher Priest

**Published in the 90s (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Now, I‚Äôve seen The Prestige adaptation and loved it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the novel could still surprise me. The outline of the two versions is similar, but the book has better characterization and sheds more light on Augier‚Äôs point of view. It also adds a present-day struggle of Borden and Augier‚Äôs descendants. Andrew, for example, feels he has a twin brother, but his birth certificate contradicts it. Is he wrong?

Anyway, if you‚Äôve seen the movie first, you‚Äôll know most big twists. Will it decrease your enjoyment? I can‚Äôt promise anything, but it didn‚Äôt spoil the fun for me.

Some readers might say The Prestige is a slow burn, and they wouldn‚Äôt be entirely wrong. But trust me, every moment of buildup is worth it for the payoff you get in the end. Priest takes his time setting the stage, slowly ratcheting up the tension until it reaches a brilliant climax.

The characterization is simply extraordinary. The strength of the voice is unforgettable.

*The Prestige* is excellent. It tells an unputdownable story of obsession, deception, and blurred boundaries between reality and illusion.

# The Oathsworn Legacy by K.R. Gangi

**Orcs, Trolls, Goblins (HM)**; also First in a Series, Criminals, self-published (HM)

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

I admit the page count of most SPFBO X‚Äôs finalists terrifies me. The Oathsworn Legacy is on the chunkier side, but it reads surprisingly fast. Why? It‚Äôs well-written and structured more like a mini-series than a typical novel with a linear progression of the plot.

It‚Äôs made of interconnected stories, so instead of a straight shot from start to finish, each ‚Äúepisode‚Äù builds on the previous one but focuses on different aspects of the bigger story. Chapters introduce new players (good and evil), deepen relationships and the world. This might throw some readers off, but for me, it worked well. Especially that the characters are one of the strongest parts of the story: well-rounded, memorable, and complex.

# Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh

**Space Opera (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh is a fast-paced, character-driven space opera that won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Not too shabby. While its fans praise the book for its critique of militarism and patriarchy, the intensity of its political messaging felt somewhat heavy-handed to me. Tesh‚Äôs writing is sharp, and she delivers a strong commentary on systems of oppression, but the characters can feel more like vehicles for these ideas than fully fleshed-out individuals. That said, I understand those who appreciate Some Desperate Glory‚Äôs subversive edge and rather fresh take on classic space opera tropes.

Overall, Some Desperate Glory is a bold, energetic novel with plenty of thought-provoking ideas, but its flaws‚Äîunlikable characters, a somewhat repetitive middle, and a too-neat ending‚Äîdecreased my enjoyment. Still, it‚Äôs a noteworthy entry in modern sci-fi that combines thrilling action with larger social critiques.

# The DEAT CAT TAIL ASSASSINS by

**POC Author (HM)**; also Bards, Space Opera, Entitled Animals

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

It was a wild ride with a breakneck pacing and high fun factor. It surpassed my expectations - I found the mix of action, humor, and some horror refreshing and entertaining. And since it‚Äôs a short book, I finished it in no time, really. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled and discreet assassin who plays by the book. She‚Äôs also deadly, undead, and wiped off any memories. She accepts a contract but can‚Äôt carry it and mayhem ensues.

# Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle

**Survival (HM**); also Eldritch Creatures (HM), Small Town  
**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

What happens when you say ‚Äúno‚Äù to Hollywood execs, dodge AI‚Äôs soulless algorithms, and accidentally bring your nightmares to life? In Chuck Tingle‚Äôs Bury Your Gays, the answer is a gory, clever, and unexpectedly heartfelt horror romp. Tingle‚Äôs writing is tight and unpretentious, with just enough sly humor to offset the tension. The ending sticks the landing, ties up themes of creativity, defiance, and queer resilience with a flourish.

I‚Äôm surprised by how much I liked Bury Your Gays. If you like your horror smart, scary, and more than a little meta, it is a must-read.

Audiobook narration: absolutely brilliant.

# Playground by Richard Powers

**Book Cover (HM)**; also Multi-POV (HM)

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I picked up Playground. I loved the cover and the premise, but recently I mostly read fast-paced books with lots of action. All easy to enjoy and digest. This one is dense and layered. But it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and left me thinking. Sure, it‚Äôs complex and occasionally a little too proud of its own cleverness, but it‚Äôs also heartfelt and packed with moments of wonder. Now, I won‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs all a smooth reading experience. The novel is dense, sometimes to the point of being intimidating. Powers clashes environmental themes, AI ethics, and human relationships, and while it‚Äôs fascinating, it sometimes felt a bit, well, much.

# Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne

**Small Town (HM)**; also Dreams

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

A haunted house story with a twist. Diavola takes the genre‚Äôs best elements and gives them a snarky, personality-packed makeover. Anna, the narrator, is sharp-tongued and divisive - if her narration clicks with you, you'll have fun. Otherwise, you'll probably DNF it.

# Your Utopia by Bora Chung

**Short Stories (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Disappointing overall. Thin ideas, solid execution.

# There is No Antimemetics Division by Qntm

**Eldritch Creatures (HM)**

**Rating:** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

Oh man, what a trip! I heard it was weird, but I didn‚Äôt expect this level of weirdness. The Antimemetics Division is one of the SCP departments that deals with ""antimemes."" Huh? Essentially, ‚Äúantimemes‚Äù are information black holes that prevent any knowledge about them from being retained or communicated.

Getting the hang of it requires a lot of mental gymnastics, but once you get past the beginning, everything becomes... Nah. Who am I kidding? It‚Äôs dizzyingly complex but also kind of fascinating.

It reads like a unique blend of weird fiction, sci-fi, and cosmic horror, told in a non-linear and scattered way. I found the book fascinating because of its weirdness and cool take on a cosmic horror. Objectively speaking, though, the prose is rather subpar and the characters flat. If you're looking for a great literary experience, this isn't it. If you're here to dig into a very interesting mythos handled uniquely, then you will love this.

Read it for fun and only if you‚Äôre okay with being confused most of the time :).¬†

# The Hidden Guardian By J.D.L Rosell

**Reference Materials (HM);** also arguably Dreams  
Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

The stakes are higher, the world is bigger, and the action is grander in this third entry of *The Ranger of the Titan Wilds*. Epic fantasy fans will eat this up, but at 711 pages, it‚Äôs a bit much for readers like me who prefer tighter narratives.

# The Storm beneath The World by Michael R. Fletcher

**Book Club (HM)**; also Reference Materials HM, First in a Series, Under the Surface, Criminals

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω

Fletcher strikes again with this wildly imaginative and entertaining story. It's one of my favorite books of 2024.

# STATS

**Male-authored books:** 18

**Female-authored books:** 7

**Books by POC authors:** 4

**Thoughts:** I could do better in balancing these stats, but ultimately, I chose books that deserved a spot on the card and that I genuinely enjoyed. There are a few obvious exceptions, so I'm all ears if you have recommendations for women-authored books featuring bards, a better Dark Academia (I‚Äôve already read *Blood Over Bright Haven* by M.L. Wang, unfortunately, so I can‚Äôt use it) and an anthology (perhaps *Book of the Witches* by Jonathan Strahan, since I already have a copy).

**The book that fits the fewest squares**: The Prestige, I think

**The book that fits the most squares:** ***Navola & Fool's Promise***

# AWARDS

Just for fun, here are some totally made-up and meaningless awards:

* **Best Plot Twist:** *Dig Two Graves* by Craig Schaefer - we finally learn who Paladin is and it's a shocker. But to appreciate it, you need to read the whole series.
* **The ""Did I Just Learn Science"" Award** *Playground* by Richard Powers contains genuine science about oceans and AI.
* **The ""I Will Not Shut Up About This"" Award** *The Storm Beneath The World*, because I think it's criminally underread and not as dark as other books by this author. In other words, give it a chance, it's worth it even if you haven't vibed with his previous stories.
* **Most Confusing Book That Was Worth It**  *There is No Antimemetics Division*. I'm really curious how strongly will it be changed for its traditionally published re-release.
* **Top 5 from the card:** *Navola, The Storm Benath The World, The Prestige, The Empusium, Fool's Promise. With that said, I feel almost all books from this card deserve to be given a chance.*

Survivor Card Game Two Player Rules,survivor,1i9uvfd,2025-01-25 14:30:15,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1i9uvfd/survivor_card_game_two_player_rules/,athrowawayhumanoid,General Discussion,"I saw a few people talking about the game, but jury was out on if the game is fun. I have to say, we modified some rules, and even created a way to play with two players, and it was a blast, especially if you record your votes and watch it back after to laugh. 

Check out the rules below and let me know if you play and have feedback! 

Set Up:

Cards- Each person is dealt six cards, including a rival Red team, who is given an immunity idol that is shuffled into their hand. Red team‚Äôs cards are placed faced down for both players to see. They are not given a vote card, but they can be voted against. 

Tribal Council Cards - Four tribal council cards (do not place one at the bottom, it‚Äôs known that at the end there is a final tribal council. Or you can place a double elimination card but know it‚Äôs a single elimination) 

Rules: 

Players are playing against the Red team who is also dealt six cards face down, except they are given a hidden immunity idol off the bat which is shuffled amongst the others in their hand that remain face down in the table. Any time the Red team is voted out, the Tribal leader flips one of the six cards. If it‚Äôs an immunity idol, the Red team is immune from elimination and the next highest team is eliminated. The tribal leader keeps that idol. Once the Red team is fully eliminated, the other players take and split their cards evenly amongst them, taking one by one by alternating. A sole player can inherit the Red team‚Äôs cards if they play the inheritance card. 

The objective is to be the last one standing. Get there by using the Red team as a ruse to blindside your opponent or save the Red team elimination until when you could really use an idol. Whatever strategy you choose is valid, but make sure to play smart. 

Card Rules:  

Most card rules are the same! But below are the modified ones. 

Let‚Äôs Form an Alliance
You both steal one card from the Red team. If the Red team is eliminated you both draw from the deck. The card initiate picks first. The cards picked from the Red team are then replaced with cards from the deck. 

Power Pair

Confession: Eris (Nuni_The_Loony) was the direct and proximal cause of the long subreddit shutdown,sorceryofthespectacle,1i9upvy,2025-01-25 14:23:36,8,0.83,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/1i9upvy/confession_eris_nuni_the_loony_was_the_direct_and/,raisondecalcul,Hail Corporate,"I am ashamed to admit this and was planning never to admit it. But Eris is being a dick and so I'm going to spill the tea.

Several years ago, Eris came over and visited me at my home in real life for one month. We went on hikes and stuff and were friends. We watched *Marvel's Agents of SHIELD* through season 4 or 5 (the current season at the time).

Eris (also known as Aminom_Marvin or Omniquery) has always been a troll online and continued to show up and troll the subreddit occasionally. They also hung out in the Telegram channels, where they would lambast anyone who disagreed with their Omniquery persona and cosmic ideology. My point is that Eris acted very different online and offline, even after meeting me and getting to know me in person.

Anyway, when I shut down the subreddit, I originally intended to only shut it down for the original four-day-protest, or maybe a week or two longer to make a point. However, during the shutdown Eris messaged me privately on Telegram, attacking me in a way [similar to here](https://old.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/1i6ai93/we_are_some_of_the_few_people_in_a_good_position/m8b15jo/). They said I was ignoring/allowing fascism and silencing the subreddit during the important news moment of AI's birth. (I don't disagree with the latter but I was also freaked out by AI scraping everything on the Internet.)

This brief conversation culminated in Eris calling me a nazi. This wouldn't have hurt my feelings so much if I hadn't considered Eris a real, real-life friend. However, I was quite hurt that my friend would misinterpret my pro-free-speech, anti-reddit protest action as nazi suppression of speech. (I think free speech is threatened when speech is *selectively* censored, not when a back-alley web forum is entirely shut down in protest of greater oppression, so I still disagree with this accusation.) I was so personally hurt by this accusation that I even deleted my conversation history with Eris‚Äîsomething Eris did or threatened to me several times during their more inspired phases‚Äîbut which, if you know me, you know I would never do because I am an archivist and hate deleting stuff. So, I was very hurt to react in that way.

So I admit it, I abreacted to Eris calling me a nazi, and it was in that moment that I decided to leave the subreddit shut-down for much longer, or indefinitely. Fuck Eris! I thought. I put all that work and love into the subreddit, I even hung out with this redditor in-person, and they STILL tossed me aside like an internet stranger, they were *still* unable to retain a memory of who I was or value our friendship. If this was Reddit, if these were the so-called ""radical"" redditors I had befriended over the years of hosting this subreddit, I was done. Fuck Eris and all the depolitical Redditors who would rather have business-as-usual than stand up to power. Fuck any Redditor who *doesn't* appreciate a protest that actually continues for a while. What kind of idiot does a protest and gives up after three days, anyway?! That's just weak.

So I said fuck it, and I decided to lean into my secondary plan, which is still operative and which I will not disclose here. This plan involved intentionally leaning into my worst moderation impulses and acting the part of a mad king. This wasn't very difficult because I was *very, very* mad, at Reddit and moreover at Eris for their cruel insult. Of course it hurts to be called a nazi‚ÄîIt hurts even more when there is a grain of truth to it, because indeed I had shut the subreddit down‚ÄîBut to have no understanding, no solidarity in the struggle, even no civility from my friend Eris‚Äîhonestly, it was too much, and I abreacted very intensively.

I had never intended to share this confession, because honestly I am quite ashamed that I allowed one little insult to blast me into the stratosphere of ragequitting for over a year. However, I am as always committed to moving based on intuition and alignment, based on my genuine feelings and opinions. I really did feel hate and anger for Reddit (still do), and I really was fed up with the lack of solidarity and real community, even from people who were my friends and should have known better politically speaking.

So, there you go. This is not the first time Eris profoundly disrupted the subreddit with their off-base, out-of-proportion, and frankly heartless trolling.

Eris, for someone who goes around preaching love and harmony all the time as their main schtick, you sure are an asshole. For someone who is such an odd ball out, you sure are committed to scapegoating and ostracizing others. For someone who is such an individualist, you sure are prone to attacking others on an individual basis.

I'm not responsible for the rise of MAGA. This subreddit has always been an anti-spectacle subreddit, and I resent the implication that we should have been encouraging coverage of the rise of fascism, as if that would have been responsible journalism at the time. This subreddit was one of the few places you could go and NOT have to read about MAGA's latest bullshit or Trump's latest atrocity. It was wonderful.

I'm not some figurehead who needs to address the universal concerns of society; this subreddit is specialized and opinionated and (as I said) we have always tried to specifically NOT allow too much mainstream news content, because you can get that literally anywhere else. People are allowed to post about the topics they want to post about‚Äîwe have never been trying to 'cover the rise of fascism with a critical journalistic intent' (though I think that's not an unfair description of how this subreddit has functioned in the past, anyway). The content of this subreddit has traditionally been focused on critical theory articles and critical or weird occultism takes (ideally in combination).

I have been planning to make an apology video for shutting down the subreddit, but I haven't gotten to it yet.

In the meantime, the game is indeed still afoot. I won't give it away, but I will say that this game is so important, so inspiring, and so politically effective that it helped to inspire me to intentionally act like a despotic mad king for an entire year, intentionally tanking my online reputation, for reasons I will not disclose. It's up to you, gentle viewer, to figure it out. We are in an Age of Breadcrumbs.

I hope you're happy, Eris. This post is the honest truth. (I wouldn't post this if it weren't also so deeply funny and curious. Eris is quite effective at disrupting the subreddit dialectically, even after all this time. That means there is yet something more to integrate, dialectically speaking.)"
