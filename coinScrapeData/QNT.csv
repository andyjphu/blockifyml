My question is with only 14.5 million coins, (which is far less than Bitcoin’s 21 million) not that I am comparing it two because that would be apples to oranges. What are your thoughts how fast this can go from $100 due to limited outstanding coins?"

Navigating the Rise of Quant (QNT) - Interoperability in the Blockchain Era  
  
Abstract  
  
In this in-depth analysis, we delve into Quant (QNT) under Section IV.M.2.a.cxxxiv, focusing on the most recent developments that have propelled its market prominence. Quant Network's Overledger platform is at the forefront of blockchain interoperability, a key factor in its recent surge. This abstract outlines the technological advancements, including updates to Overledger and the integration of new blockchains, alongside Quant's pivotal role in institutional projects like Project Rosalind and collaborations with major financial institutions. We explore the market dynamics, highlighting significant price movements and investor sentiment, particularly around speculation of staking mechanisms. Regulatory insights, such as Quant's mention in a MIT and Bank of England paper on the Digital Pound, are analyzed for their implications on QNT's future. Technical analysis, community engagement, and the road ahead for Quant are also covered, providing a comprehensive overview of why Quant is not just a token but a cornerstone in blockchain's infrastructural evolution.

**Q: Are there truly any blockchains that NEED a utility coin/token/crypto? Or can enterprises and banks just use blockchain technology without using its crypto via payments for the software subscription in fiat?**

I know that Quant, for example, in order to use their Overledger that connects public and private networks or mdapps, you have to use QNT to pay the licensing fees (I think). I somewhat understand that Bitcoin blockchain compensates node operators with Bitcoin for their efforts in verifying the network and keeping it secure. You also need the LINK token to access and interact with the Chainlink oracle system. Ripple also offers its customers the ability to use XRP for cross-border payments which is supposedly cheaper (whether these financial institutions truly use it or not). So that makes sense to me that there may be an incentive to buy those specific altcoins as an increase in application usage could be correlated to an increase in coin price. Or I could be entirely confused, conflating ideas, and way off in my understanding.

I appreciate everyone's feedback in advance. I'm not heavy on the technical side, so please be graceful as I try to understand and separate the hype. I'm not asking for financial advice but the answers may be useful in approaching investment decisions. I know that Reddit may be a good starting point to learn although I acknowledge there may be misinformation. Thanks again!

Lastly, are there any crypto coins that I should consider that are needed to use its technology? Thanks!"

Singapore TradeTrust contributes to ISO TC 307.,Hedera,1grdpjg,2024-11-14 14:58:59,34,0.97,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1grdpjg,Perfect_Ability_1190,Discussion,"In a doc by Singapore's digital trade framework we see they give some insight on their adoption of ISO standards for DLT.

We learn Singapore's contributed to 2 use cases in TC 307 for digital trade.

Reminder $XDC & $HBAR are the ONLY two public DLTs that are connected to TradeTrust in the ""Community Trusted Networks"".

And of course, both have their own respective ties to $QNT, the founder of ISO TC 307.

More specifically they state 2 specific utilities around digital trade and DLT that they've contributed to.

1⃣Verification & provenance of digital documents through using DLT

2⃣Electronic transferrable record custody and use in both DLT & non DLT systems for trade transaction giving LEGACY:DLT interoperability.

We've already seen Singapore adopting TC 307 related frameworks via Monetary Authority Singapore.

A perfect example is how they demonstrate interoperability of CBDCs via API Gateways.

This example is visible in their Global Layer 1 framework, in addition to other CBDCs they've tested their CBDC Ubin with such as Canada's Jasper & NY's Cedar.

While these technically fall under SATP frameworks with the API Gateways, keep in mind ISO TC 307 itself also has an Interoperability working group.

With that working group chaired by none other than Quant Network CEO & TC 307 founder Gilbert Verdian.

It's quite interesting to see this when we factor in how both XDC & Hedera are the only ""community trusted networks"" on TradeTrust.

XDC obviously has it's respective ties to Quant & Overledger with direct integration.

This is from Overledger adding support for XDC.

On the other hand we've seen various cases of Hedera & Overledger being connected in their own ways.

First is Paolo Tasca, former Quant cofounder & current Hedera Co-Chair for Treasury being an ISO TC 307 committee member himself.

Then there's the fact that we've seen SATP's architecture mentioned alongside Hedera Consensus in documents like IBM's patents.

Singapore's TradeTrust is definitely going the right way with Enterprise DLT adoption.🔥

Comments like the following on random posts:  
It's disheartening to witness the lack of tangible progress from Quant Network and the team, led by Gilbert Verdian. Many of us invested in $QNT with high expectations, only to see promises that haven't materialised into meaningful outcomes. Rather than fostering growth and genuine engagement with the community, it feels as though the focus has been on maximising token sales at the expense of investor trust. This lack of transparency and progress leaves token holders feeling misled and disillusioned. A clear and accountable direction is needed to restore confidence and move forward.

What do you exactly think you're entitled to and hope to achieve? 

We've never operated like a memecoin that only markets and posts to shill their token. So called community engagement that you're used to or are expecting.  
Our goals haven't changed and our enterprise focus is the same as it always has been. We're bringing enterprise to blockchain and have been doing so since we started. Our efforts are best placed for mainstream adoption. You've all seen the public news from clients and the projects we've been working on. 

  
What promises are you referring to? Everything that was set out in the 2018 business paper has been achieved and more. I suggest you go and read it again and also understand the details in the paper that a utility token is not an investment and holders are not investors, the token gives access to the platform. Regarding price of the token? You expect ""do something"" to increase price? That is set by the market no matter whatever is delivered.

It's been the constant ""Wen x"" since 2018. 

Wen exchanges, wen tier 1 exchanges, wen binance - well that was all delivered.

Wen dashboards - the lacchain dashboard has been live for years. 

Wen clients - wen this.. wen that..

Why don't you put your effort instead into creating new multi chain dapps, or issue new interoperable tokens on different blockchains or create bridges with a few clicks on the developer platform?  
The developer portal has enabled direct QNT payment to the platform for years for any user, developer or corporate to use.

Regarding staking. What was said recently ""Yes the concept of rcgs was explored and tested back then, we had live testing and people helped run those tests to learn from it. **It was paused due to the regulatory uncertainty.** Which when you look back at that time, regulators were taking action against Coinbase, Ripple, staking, lending, learn programs etc. It was an extremely risky evironment. So we had to pause the concept until things were certain. But we've kept working on the ideas in the background. So now, after getting regulatory and legal clarity, we will be introducing different forms of staking and rewards to encourage even more participation on Overledger Platform and ecosystem.

He is joined by a team of experienced professionals with backgrounds in blockchain, cryptography, and software development.*

Why XRP still has a chance against QNT. Let’s talk about it.,QNT,1fd3tbo,2024-09-09 19:30:23,3,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/QNT/comments/1fd3tbo/why_xrp_still_has_a_chance_against_qnt_lets_talk/,hopefinanciallyfree,,"I’ve been heavily invested in **Quant (QNT)** for a while now, and I truly believe it’s one of the strongest projects out there, especially with its focus on interoperability and its partnerships with major institutions. That said, I’ve been seeing a lot of discussion around **XRP** and wanted to play devil’s advocate for a moment.

Here’s why **XRP** might still give **QNT** some competition:

1. **Adoption in the Banking Sector**: XRP has been around longer and has established partnerships with many banks and payment providers. Ripple’s focus on cross-border payments has given XRP a major presence in the remittance industry, and their connections run deep.

2. **Liquidity and Volume**: XRP consistently ranks high in terms of trading volume and liquidity. It’s still one of the most traded tokens globally, and that liquidity could give it an edge in adoption and integration, particularly in the financial sector.

3. **Focus on Payments**: While QNT is broadening the horizon by targeting interoperability and integration across all blockchains, XRP has a laser focus on **cross-border payments**. It’s a more specialized niche, and there’s something to be said about being the best in a focused area.

4. **Speed and Cost**: XRP transactions are lightning-fast and incredibly cheap. While QNT operates on Ethereum (for now) with its higher fees, XRP offers a practical solution for micro-transactions, which could be a big deal in the future as global payment systems evolve.

That being said, **QNT** still seems to have a much broader long-term vision, but I’d love to hear what you guys think. **Does XRP pose any real threat to QNT in the long run?** Or is QNT’s approach to interoperability going to outshine all competition?

Looking forward to your thoughts on how these two giants stack up!"

**News Article**

After hitting historic lows during the bear market, popular meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a sudden increase in popularity, reaching a 24-hour trading volume of $528 million. This resurgence can be attributed to social media influencers and communities rallying behind SHIB, driving renewed interest in the asset. Despite being known primarily as a meme coin, the Shiba Inu community aims to build an entire decentralized ecosystem around the token, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), and even physical merchandise. As the Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to evolve, analysts predict that its influence and relevance in the broader cryptocurrency landscape will continue to expand.

Arthur Hayes Bitmex Whale Chat Quant (QNT) tokens exchange scam on Telegram,CryptoScams,1ej5m8t,2024-08-03 11:11:04,5,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1ej5m8t/arthur_hayes_bitmex_whale_chat_quant_qnt_tokens/,BendImpossible7790,Scam Operation,"Hereby I take the time to report a crypto scam involving the private Bitmex Whale Chat channel on Telegram, allegedly run by crypto billionaire Arthur Hayes and his assistant Catherine.

Although I haven’t been scammed myself, some people I know have had this unpleasant experience. After the evil had been done, I took some serious time to investigate this scam. This is a report of my findings, in the hope that search engines pick up this piece, so that it gets indexed, and alerts others before they are tempted to fall for this scam, but still have the common sense in them to do some online research before going through.

The offer:
The crooks use the name and fame of crypto billionaire Arthur Hayes to lure people to their private Telegram channel. At the moment of writing this piece, the name of this channel is Bitmex Whale Chat, but “Arthur” tends to love to change the name of his private channel and his Telegram user name when the chance of his scam practices getting exposed is increasing. So beware…

Despite name changes, the core of the scam remains the same. “Arthur Hayes” has a problem. And you, my dear friend, can help him out, and make some fine profit by doing so. You see, “Arthur” apparently has been one of the angel investors at Quant (quant.network), and because of that he got rewarded with a huge chunk of Quant (QNT) tokens, with the limitation that he isn’t allowed to sell them at the exchanges for a period of 3 years, since that would impact the price of the tokens in a negative way. However, his contract with Quant apparently allows him to sell small portions of his token pile to individual investors at discount prices. And once you, as a participant in the Bitmex Whale Chat, buy his Quants, you can sell them immediately on any exchange you prefer, and by doing so at least quickly double the money that you invested.

To prove to potential investors that those deals with “Arthur Hayes” are real, the Bitmex Whale Chat channel is stuffed with screenshots, where happy investors show their gain, building trust with others to take the same steps. In reality, all those happy investors are fake accounts with fake screenshots, created by the crooks themselves. However, in some of those screenshots, they have forgotten to hide the wallet address. If you take the time to thoroughly investigate those wallet addresses, you will find out that all they do is pump money around to create new screenshots. Their wallets often contain millions of dollars, so it obviously is a very lucrative scam.

The scam practices:
So far I have been told about 3 different ways in which “Arthur Hayes” and his assistant Catherine scammed people out of their hard-earned money.

1) The quick hit
A potential investor approaches assistant Catherine with the request to do a trade. She sets up a USDT receipt address on the Tron or Ethereum network, gives you the wallet address to where you have to send your crypto dollars, and asks you to wait for 10-15 minutes, while the transaction gets confirmed a couple of dozen times on the blockchain. Before that specific number of confirmations has been reached, the investor is blocked from accessing Catherine, “Arthur Hayes” and the private Bitmex Whale Cchat. Your money is gone and there is no chance to complain, nor can you report the channel with Telegram, while the crooks know that none of the investors takes the effort to copy the link to their private channel before getting involved in this scam.

2) The fake exchanges
If you are “lucky”, then the crooks love to play a game with you where it takes a bit longer for the average victim to realize he/she got scammed. In this case, the deal appears to be successful. You will get your Quant tokens for your USDT. Or at least it looks like that. If Catherine doesn’t disappear with your money immediately, she (or “Arthur Hayes”) comes up with the excuse that there is an “error” in the software that prevents her from sending the Quant tokens directly to your requested wallet address. She then plays the fear of loss card very well and continues by offering you a great “life-saving” solution. It appears to be possible to do an internal transaction instead at an exchange where “Arthur Hayes” also has an account. In the cases that I know of, investors were guided to sign up at Grembit.com or Mexibit.com, but don’t be surprised if the crooks come up with other domain names for new versions of their scam. In reality, both “exchanges” are fake. On the outside, they look different, but once logged in, you quickly see that they are totally identical.

At these fake exchanges, the victims actually see the Quant tokens appear in their account (hooray, a successful deal), but don’t realize yet that the pain still has to happen. You can actually trade the Quants into any other cryptocurrency of your liking, but when it comes to withdrawing everything is halted. Or better said: taken hostage. Before being able to withdraw, you have to go through a KYC and AML procedure. That sounds legit until you reach level 3 of this process. Then it turns out that you only can get fully verified for withdrawals if you first make a substantial deposit “for AML reasons” (in the case of one of the victims that I know of it was set at $7000). Ever heard of such an AML procedure at legit exchanges? Me neither. This is just a method that the crooks use to double-dip into the victims' wallet and make their loss even bigger. You most certainly can expect that the “support” department of these fake exchanges comes up with a slew of bullshit reasons after such a deposit to prevent you from actually withdrawing.

3) The boomerang
The boomerang method that these crooks use has a lot of similarities with what I already have written above regarding the fake exchanges. This time, however, the investor refuses to sign up at one of those fake exchanges that are offered and insists that he rather wait until the “error” in the software gets solved, so that he can get his Quant tokens in his own, already existing wallet. That’s where the crooks are going to play the trust card. Catherine (or “Arthur Hayes”) then says: “Then we can’t do the deal, and I will refund you your USDT”. And they actually do so! But that is not the end of the game. A little while later, Catherine (or “Arthur Hayes”) suddenly contacts the victim again with the good news that she/he has found a solution for the “error” in the software, and that a direct transaction to your own wallet can happen after all. “Are you still interested?” SInce the crooks have built trust by sending the funds back, they know that their potential victim won’t say no to such an offer. Once the funds are transferred to the crooks again, it turns out that that pesky software “error” still persists, and that it only can be solved in a couple of days. During that waiting time, the crooks block you from contacting them, as decribed in scam method 1.

I hope this long read saves some people from falling for these scam practices. Apparently “Arthur Hayes” and Catherine have been scamming people this way on a daily basis for more than a year already. Even though I reported these scams through the Bitmex Whale Chat channel to Telegram, but so far no action has been taken to stop them."
"Quant (QNT) ERC20 token on Ethereum blockchchain, a niche project?",ethtrader,1e0ohvt,2024-07-11 09:05:46,6,0.8,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1e0ohvt/quant_qnt_erc20_token_on_ethereum_blockchchain_a/,Sky-876,Discussion,"Quant (QNT) is an ERC 20 token on Ethereum blockchain, it is used to power Quant Network's Overledger brand of enterprise software solutions, which wants to connect public blockchains and private networks.  The Overledger was designed to act as a gateway for any blockchain-based project to access all other blockchains.

Some even talk about that Quant could be the Microsoft of the blockchain.

All-time chart according to [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com) :

[https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/quant](https://preview.redd.it/ukdtjh730wbd1.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=f201a4270f900734c74f3971cff964882fa5deca)

The highest price paid for Quant (QNT) is $427.42, which was recorded on September 11, 2021

The circulating supply is 14,612,493. The total supply is just as large. That´s very good tokenomics.

Quant Network partners include major institutions and companies such as SIA, which connects more than 500 banks, as well as Pay. UK, SIMBAchain and AX Trading. These partnerships underline the practical relevance and trust in the Overledger network and its technology.

They are also partnered with the BIS (Bank of international settlement) and work with the Bank of England on CBDCs.

Project Rosalind directed by the BIS Innovation Hub London Centre, has been testing how  APIs could facilitate retail payments in CBDCs and support the  exploration of innovative CBDC use cases.

I know that many don´t like CBDCs. But we can't do anything about it as little fish, but we could benefit from it.

What do you think about this project? Does it have any future?

"If I gave you a million quid, and you had to pick one cryptocurrency to invest all of it in, what would you pick and why?",CryptoCurrency,1d9j40z,2024-06-06 10:10:27,0,0.38,225,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1d9j40z/if_i_gave_you_a_million_quid_and_you_had_to_pick/,thedmdapro,DISCUSSION,"I’m trying to learn more about different cryptocurrencies and would like to understand the reasoning behind people’s decision to invest in various cryptocurrencies. 

There’s so many different coins out there, and the technology that goes behind each one is different and unique in some cases way, I want to know if this plays a role in the decision making aspect of making an investment. Does the practical application of the cryptocurrency matter? Are you looking to make a quick buck? What is the reasoning behind your logic to purchase this specific cryptocurrency? 

I personally would invest in Quant(QNT) due to their progression towards interoperability across blockchain networks for CBDCs which they’re testing with central banks within the European Union.

I also think that their approach to the solution is the right one and the one that has the most future (centralized and licensed, pay-per-use).

But I don't quite understand why a private company, with intellectual property and also some patent rights, launches a token so that practically anyone can participate in its success if it works, why do they give this gift to ordinary citizens?

**The utilities that Quant wants to implement through the token could also be implemented privately** and the company would be much more beneficial to them.

For example the **payment of the developer license is done directly in cash, it is not linked to the token QNT**.

**Why do they link the token to other functionalities?**  
**Why do they let us ordinary citizens participate and not keep it to a small private circle?**  
**Did ordinary citizens have the opportunity to participate in the success of Paypal, or Stripe, or a long etcetera?**"

NDAX Spotlight Coin – Quant – QNT,NDAX,1asdn18,2024-02-16 12:02:36,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NDAX/comments/1asdn18/ndax_spotlight_coin_quant_qnt/,kardanokid,,"Hey NDAXers,

Today’s NDAX Spotlight Coin is Quant (QNT). Quant Network, founded by Gilbert Verdian in 2015 developed the “Overledger” which is essentially an operating system which can be used to build blockchain solutions whilst sitting “over” any existing blockchain ledgers and/or older, legacy technologies such as SWIFT. 

The key use case for Quant Network is interoperability. Quant’s blockchain, the Overledger can sit over any existing blockchain. Their target audience are financial institutions, SMEs and developers who, must use QNT tokens to pay a licence fee in order to access the Overledger (via Quant Connect IIRC). Moreover, Developers require QNT tokens to build on the Overledger platform. However, licences to use Quant Network’s services are purchased by developers using traditional fiat currency, which in turn is then converted to QNT tokens by the 'Quant Treasury'. Essentially this ensures that businesses can make compliant purchases without dealing with exchanges directly.

QNT Token functions as a utility token on the Quant Network platform, which will allow Users the access of the Quant Network platform. Through the token sale, the users acquire the rights to use the Quant Network platform. In addition Quant is also actively engaged in the advancement of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
