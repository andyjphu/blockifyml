"Kripto Para Nedir?, Kripto Para Ne Demek?",yatirimdanismanligi,1i9qa7h,2025-01-25 11:11:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yatirimdanismanligi/comments/1i9qa7h/kripto_para_nedir_kripto_para_ne_demek/,dreaministanbul,,"Kripto para, dijital veya sanal bir para birimidir ve işlemleri güvenli hale getirmek için kriptografi teknolojisi kullanılır. Geleneksel para birimlerinden farklı olarak fiziksel bir şekli yoktur ve merkezi bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilmez. Kripto paralar, blockchain adı verilen dağıtık bir defter teknolojisi üzerinde çalışir. Bu teknoloji, tüm işlemlerin şeffaf ve değiştirilemez bir şekilde kaydedilmesini sağlar.

# Kripto Para Çeşitleri

Kripto paralar farklı amaçlara hizmet eden çeşitli türlere ayrılabilir:

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en popüler kripto paradır. 2009 yılında Satoshi Nakamoto takma adıyla biri veya bir grup tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Dijital altın olarak da adlandırılan Bitcoin, bir değer saklama aracı ve ödeme sistemi olarak kullanılır.

# 2. Altcoin’ler

Bitcoin haricindeki tüm kripto paralar “altcoin” olarak adlandırılır. Bazı popüler altcoin’ler şunlardır:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** Akıllı sözleşmeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) için bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):** Hızlı uluslararası ödeme sistemleri için kullanılır.
* **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’in daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hızlı işlem yapılmasını sağlar.

# 3. Stablecoin’ler

Stablecoin’ler, fiyat dalgalanmasını azaltmak için itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altın gibi fiziksel varlıklara endekslenmiştir. Örnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4. Meme Coin’ler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) üzerine kurulu kripto paralardır. Örneğin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5. NFT’ler ve Token’lar

* **NFT’ler (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlıkları temsil eder.
* **Token’lar:** Belirli bir platformda veya ekosistemde kullanılmak için oluşturulan dijital varlıklardır.

# Kripto Paranın Avantajları

Kripto paraları kullanmanın çok sayıda avantajı vardır:

# 1. Merkeziyetsizlik

Kripto paralar, herhangi bir merkezi otoriteye bağlı olmadığı için daha şeffaf ve özgür bir finansal sistem sunar.

# 2. Hızlı ve Düşük Maliyetli İşlemler

Kripto para transferleri genellikle çok hızlıdır ve geleneksel bankacılık sistemine göre daha düşük üretlere sahiptir.

# 3. Sınırsız ve Evrensel Erişim

Kripto paraları kullanmak için bir banka hesabına gerek yoktur. Bir internet bağlantısına sahip herkes, dünyanın her yerinden bu paralara erişebilir.

# 4. Yatırım Fırsatları

Kripto paralar, yüksek getirili bir [**yatırım**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/) aracı olarak popülerlik kazanmıştır. Bitcoin gibi bazı kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatırımlar için tercih edilmektedir.

# 5. Güvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin değiştirilemez ve güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasını sağlar. Bu da kripto paraları geleneksel sistemlere göre daha güvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranın Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken dikkate alınması gereken bazı önemli riskler vardır:

# 1. Fiyat Dalgalanması (Volatilite)

Kripto paraların değeri kısa süre içinde büyük ölçülerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, yüksek kâr getirme potansiyeli olduğu kadar yüksek kayıp riskini de beraberinde getirir.

# 2. Siber Güvenlik Riskleri

Kripto para borsalarının hacklenmesi veya bireysel cüzdanların ele geçirilmesi durumunda kayıplar yaşanabilir.

# 3. Regülasyon ve Yasal Belirsizlikler

Birçok ülkede kripto paraların yasal durumu tam olarak netleşmemiştir. Bu da yasal riskler doğurabilir.

# 4. Teknik Bilgi Eksikliği

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken teknik bilgi eksikliği yanlış kararlar alınmasına neden olabilir.

# 5. Dolandırıcılık ve Ponzi Yapılar

Bazı sahte projeler ve dolandırıcılık amaçlı kripto para girşimleri, yatırımcıları büyük kayıplara uğratabilir.

Kripto paralar, modern finans dünyasını yeniden şekillendiren bir yenilik olarak dikkat çekiyor. Avantajları ve yatırım fırsatları cazip olsa da, beraberinde getirdiği riskleri dikkatlice değerlendirmek önemlidir. Kripto paralara yönelik bir yatırım yapmadan önce detaylı bir araştırma yapmak ve finansal durumunuzu göz önünde bulundurmak önemlidir.

The company will provide a platform for us to register and complete tasks. If you work 30 days you will receive thousands of dollars ($3000-$5000) apart from everyday commissions of 0.5%-2% on every submission. You will also get money for just logging on each and every day.

You will get small amounts and be able to withdraw actual $US money to keep you hooked.

In most cases, the victim completes a few “assignments,” and gets paid tiny amounts of cryptocurrency (often [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), ETH or USDC). This is meant to build trust before the real scam kicks in.

They continue to promise your money is safe and you need only complete the assignment to get the entire withdrawal amount.

To be honest I only paid for P1 cost around 42 USDT (tether US the currency they work with) and gaining from the task they gave me but didn't withdraw anything yet and they have their own WhatsApp group. some ppl in the group claim that they actually received their pay through their digital wallet with screenshots but something seems off with this (easy to earn) money that bugs me.

The video-sharing giant, Rumble, has unveiled plans for its very own crypto wallet, aptly named the Rumble Wallet. Announced by CEO Chris Pavlovski, this innovative feature aims to simplify transactions between users and creators.  

Supporting $BTC and USDT, the wallet will enable direct payments for subscriptions and tips, offering an effortless way for creators to monetize their content. Pavlovski calls this a step toward building a “new financial highway,” empowering creators and positioning Rumble as a pioneer among platforms embracing blockchain.  

With nearly 100 million monthly active users, industry leaders predict the wallet could disrupt the game, opening doors to broader crypto adoption. This marks another chapter in Rumble’s larger crypto-focused strategy, which includes acquiring Bitcoin and securing a $775 million investment from Tether.  

The video platform is already tasting success, with its stock price doubling in just six months. With a strengthened financial ecosystem and a leap into digital payments, Rumble solidifies its stance as a trailblazer in crypto integration.

In a significant move, the SEC has launched a new crypto task force aimed at setting a sensible regulatory path for the cryptocurrency industry. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as ""crypto mom"" for her supportive stance on crypto innovation, this task force marks a shift from the previous enforcement-heavy approach to clearer regulation and guidance[3].

Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted at the possibility of delisting Tether's USDT if it fails to comply with upcoming U.S. regulations. The potential new rules could require stablecoin issuers to back their tokens entirely with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo periodic audits. Armstrong emphasized Coinbase's commitment to compliance and helping users transition to more secure assets[1][5].

In other news, President-elect Donald Trump has launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, which saw its market capitalization soar to several billion dollars shortly after its launch. Despite initial skepticism, the coin's popularity has been fueled by announcements on Trump's official social media channels. However, experts caution against the speculative nature of meme coins[2].

On the legislative front, the new administration is expected to work with Congress on stablecoin and market structure reforms, further defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in crypto regulations. A crypto council is also in the works to develop new regulatory policies, making 2025 a pivotal year for the crypto space[3].

In corporate news, Circle has acquired Hashnote for an undisclosed amount, and Solana's stablecoin supply has seen a 60% increase since Friday. Justin Sun has outlined a plan to push Ethereum to $10,000, and Jupiter is set to airdrop $630 million in JUP tokens. Bitcoin miners are enjoying tripled profit margins, and BTC mining has reportedly saved Texas $18 billion[3].

Riot Platforms is pivoting to AI data centers, and CLS Global has pleaded guilty to wash trading. CryptoCom has relaunched its US exchange, and KULR has bought another $8 million in BTC. Finland has launched its first-ever crypto ETPs, and the banking industry, led by BofA CEO, is ready to embrace crypto[3].

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MicroStrategy shareholders have approved more BTC purchases, and Rex Shares has filed for ETFs related to $TRUMP, DOGE, and BONK. A Texas court has reversed sanctions on Tornado Cash, and there are plans to converge traditional finance and crypto, according to the Financial Times[3].

Article from my exchange
Bitvavo stops Tether (USDT): What does this mean for users?
Bitvavo has announced that it will stop supporting Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin on the crypto market, as of January 31, 2025. This decision is related to the new guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations.

Stricter European regulations for stablecoins
European rules impose strict requirements on stablecoins such as USDT. For example, stablecoins must be sufficiently backed by assets, such as cash or government bonds, and issuers must be transparent about the composition of their reserves and their value.

Since USDT does not currently meet these conditions, Bitvavo has decided to end support for the stablecoin. In a statement, the platform emphasizes that compliance with laws and regulations is a priority. While the loss of the largest stablecoin may be disappointing, Bitvavo states that these measures are in the interest of all users. Compliance with the rules ensures that the stablecoins supported by the platform remain reliable and users are not exposed to unnecessary risks.

Theory: Why the U.S. Won’t Directly Buy Bitcoin but Could Issue a BTC-Backed USD Stablecoin—And How History Might Repeat Itself,Bitcoin,1i8h4gn,2025-01-23 18:19:20,0,0.2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i8h4gn/theory_why_the_us_wont_directly_buy_bitcoin_but/,WhoTheFLetTheDogsOut,,"# 1. Introduction

There’s long been speculation about whether the U.S. government will start accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) outright. But, given how U.S. monetary policy and public finances function, a **more likely scenario** is that the government will **create a USD-pegged stablecoin** (let’s call it “FedCoin,” though it may simply be dubbed “USD”) **backed (at least in part) by BTC**—rather than spending taxpayer money to directly purchase and hold Bitcoin. This approach allows the government to retain **control** over currency issuance, leverage Bitcoin’s growing reputation as “digital gold,” and potentially **repeat the historical cycle** where a currency is launched with a “hard asset” backing before eventually depegging.

# 2. Lessons From Gold-Backed USD

# 2.1 Gold Seizure & Peg

* In the early 20th century, the U.S. government effectively **nationalized gold** by requiring citizens to exchange their gold for U.S. dollars.
* This forced adoption of the dollar, which was **officially redeemable in gold**, thereby bolstering trust in the currency.

# 2.2 Erosion of the Gold Standard

* Over time, the gold standard was **dismantled in stages**, culminating in the **1971 “Nixon Shock,”** which ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold.
* This gave the government **greater flexibility** to manage the money supply without being constrained by gold holdings.

# 2.3 Parallels to a BTC-Backed Stablecoin

* Just as the dollar once relied on gold to bolster confidence, a future “FedCoin” could be **partially backed by BTC**—mirroring gold’s old role.
* Eventually, as with gold, the government might find it advantageous to **depeg from BTC** once FedCoin is deeply entrenched.

# 3. Why a BTC-Backed USD Stablecoin Makes Sense

# 3.1 Avoid Direct Volatility Exposure

* Holding BTC reserves in the Treasury could be politically risky, especially if prices **drop sharply** or—worst-case scenario—the holding wallet is compromised.
* A stablecoin structure allows the government to **benefit from BTC’s potential upside** while insulating taxpayers from direct volatility.

# 3.2 Control and Regulation

* **Regulatory On-Ramp:** By issuing its own stablecoin, the government can fully control both the **fiat on-ramp and off-ramp** to crypto.
* **Built-In Compliance:** A state-backed stablecoin can **embed KYC/AML** requirements, ensuring robust regulatory oversight at scale.

# 3.3 Monetary Policy Flexibility

* **Supply Management:** As with the Fed’s current operations, the government can **expand or contract** the stablecoin supply depending on broader monetary goals.
* **Market Influence:** By holding a BTC reserve, the U.S. could exert **significant influence** on crypto markets, at least in terms of perceived trust or liquidity.

# 4. Paying Down Debt Through Stablecoin Revenue

# 4.1 Stablecoin Revenue Model

* Private stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) hold **billions in reserves**, often in low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries.
* The **interest earned** on these reserves can be **substantial**, creating a lucrative revenue stream for the issuer.

# 4.2 Government-Issued Stablecoin = National Debt Relief

* **Interest Income:** A Fed-issued stablecoin holding a large pool of fiat reserves (and BTC) could generate **billions** in interest income.
* **Asset Appreciation:** If Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, the gains on that portion of the reserves could **bolster the Treasury** and help offset national debt.

# 5. Resistance and Government Incentives

# 5.1 Natural Pushback from Crypto Holders

* Some Bitcoin holders prefer **self-custody** and are highly **wary of government intrusion** into the crypto space.
* There would likely be **resistance** to trading in BTC for a government-controlled stablecoin, owing to **privacy**, **independence**, and **trust** concerns.

# 5.2 Likely Incentives for Converting BTC to FedCoin

* The government might offer **favorable tax treatment** for any gains realized when converting BTC to FedCoin.
   * **Reduced Capital Gains:** A lower tax rate or a **tax holiday** on BTC gains if holders move coins to FedCoin within a specific window.
   * **Ease of Liquidity:** Immediate liquidation or easy conversion to fiat **without the usual tax burdens**.
* This mirrors past tactics: just as the government used policy tools (and outright mandates) for gold, they could use **tax incentives** to encourage—or coerce—the crypto community into adopting FedCoin.

# 5.3 For the Bitcoin Decentralized Maxis

* It’s understandable that **decentralization advocates** would despise the idea of handing over BTC to a government-controlled token.
* Still, if the government’s **tax incentives** for swapping to FedCoin are attractive enough, even some die-hard BTC holders might **split their bags**—opting to partially convert if it eases their **tax burden** or provides some liquidity benefits.
* This compromise might not align perfectly with **Bitcoin maximalist values**, but it could be an **enticing “deal”** for those looking to hedge or reduce tax obligations.

# 6. Eventual Depegging: A “New Dollar”

# 6.1 The Gold Standard All Over Again

* Initially, tying a stablecoin to Bitcoin might **bolster its credibility** and encourage adoption among both retail and institutional users.
* Over time, once FedCoin is dominant, the government may **depeg from BTC**—akin to how the gold standard was abandoned—thus creating a **purely fiat-based “new dollar.”**

# 6.2 Rationale for Cutting the BTC Link

* **Volatility Concerns:** If BTC’s market fluctuations start to introduce **systemic risks**, severing the peg might protect broader financial stability.
* **Monetary Freedom:** Historically, the U.S. has shown a preference for **unconstrained monetary policy**. If BTC’s finite supply and price dynamics get in the way, depegging becomes attractive.

# 6.3 Shielding from Hyperinflation of the “Old USD”

* One **slightly more sinister** aspect is that by creating a new, partially BTC-backed USD, the U.S. could **shield itself** from the worst effects of hyperinflation on the **“old” fiat USD** if it ever came to pass.
* As long as the **new USD** remains (at least temporarily) backed by BTC, it might enjoy **immunity** from the runaway printing that could cripple the old-dollar system.
* This creates a scenario where the government effectively **“switches horses”** if the old USD becomes too inflated, leaving holders of the legacy currency bearing the brunt of potential hyperinflation.

# 7. Private Sector Success as a Proof of Concept

# 7.1 Circle (USDC) & Tether (USDT)

* These stablecoins have a combined market cap in the **tens of billions**, demonstrating **strong market demand** for fiat-pegged crypto assets.
* Issuers derive **significant revenue** from their reserves, proving the model is **highly profitable** at scale.

# 7.2 Why the U.S. Government Could Outperform

* An **official FedCoin** has the full **backing of the U.S. government**, likely leading to **unparalleled trust** among users globally.
* Being pegged to the **world’s reserve currency (USD)** would likely secure widespread **domestic and international adoption**.

# 8. Conclusion: A Controlled Transition Away from the Traditional Dollar

1. **Digital Gold & Historical Echoes:** Just as gold once backed the dollar, BTC could initially back FedCoin.
2. **Revenue & Debt Reduction:** Stablecoin issuance could bolster government coffers through interest income, **offsetting national debt** without new taxes.
3. **Managed Crypto On-Ramp:** By issuing FedCoin, the U.S. would maintain a **tight grip** on crypto adoption, with **compliance** built into its design.
4. **Eventual Depegging:** If history is any guide, once the government is firmly in control, it may **sever BTC convertibility**—repeating the gold standard playbook.
5. **Incentivized Adoption:** To overcome resistance from crypto enthusiasts, the government could use **tax incentives** to encourage swapping BTC for FedCoin, which—even if not aligned with maximalist values—some holders may find irresistible.
6. **Shielding from Hyperinflation:** By pivoting to a **“new USD”** that’s (initially) backed by BTC, the U.S. might insulate itself from any **hyperinflation** risk tied to the old fiat USD.

Ultimately, while some may celebrate any **government acknowledgment** of Bitcoin’s role as a reserve, this scenario poses the risk of **history repeating itself**: a novel currency might begin life tied to a “hard” asset, only to **later abandon** that backing once it has cemented its global dominance.

# What’s Your Take?

* **Would a BTC-backed FedCoin accelerate crypto adoption, or would it stifle the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin?**
* **How likely is it that the government would offer special tax incentives for converting BTC to FedCoin?**
* **Does this represent a genuine step forward for Bitcoin, or just another twist on government monetary control?**

"Trump's DeFi project buys $25 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, TRON, AAVE and ENA",CapitalistExploits,1i7rxrx,2025-01-22 20:30:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7rxrx/trumps_defi_project_buys_25_million_worth_of/,kayakero,,"US President-elect Donald Trump, through his DeFi project **World Liberty Financial (WLFI)**, recently made a major operation in the cryptocurrency market.

WLFI acquired approximately $24.6 million worth of altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ENA).

According to data from the Arkham platform, the WLFI treasury converted around $24.6 million of the USDC stablecoin into these cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, the project purchased $4.7 million of each token, except for Ethena, with an investment of $2.3 million. These acquisitions reflect a strategy of diversifying WLFI's assets, moving away from stablecoins and betting on more speculative tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/s8c1vuawzbee1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f44f66ad53ab2802224412643353f55c252788

# Trump's crypto project

Currently, WLFI has a diversified portfolio, with the largest holding of **43,000 ETH**, valued at approximately **$143 million** , representing the largest stake. Additionally, it holds **$96 million in Tether (USDT)** and **$56 million in USD Coin (USDC)**.

Other assets include nearly **$6.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, Aave and Chainlink** , **$4.6 million in Tron** and **$3 million in Ethena**.

>Also, WLFI added memecoins to its portfolio, purchasing Hoppy (""Pepe's friend""), and interestingly Pulsechain  (PLS), Richard Heart token is part of the holdings.

It is important to note that despite the recent launch of Trump's official memecoin, **$TRUMP, which generated $25 billion** in revenue in 24 hours, WLFI did not acquire any tokens of this cryptocurrency.

In November, Tron founder Justin Sun invested **$30 million** in WLFI tokens and was quickly appointed as an advisor to the project.

Recently, WLFI sold close to **$10 million worth of WBTC tokens** days before the presidential inauguration. This move sparked speculation, although WLFI stated that these transactions are part of its regular asset management.

The WLFI wallet also saw significant deposits in Ethereum and USDT. Despite the controversies and with a total value estimated at over **$17 million** , the project remains open and is looking to raise **$300 million** by selling **20 billion WLFI tokens**.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[UPDATE]  Bright Kindle executes Deed of Exchange for Strong Built...** **Bright Kindle** [BKR 1.26 ▼9.3%; 66% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9c23dddd38650ba6ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said that its wholly-owned subsidiary, **Brightstar Holdings and Development Inc** (BHDI), signed a Deed of Exchange to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of **Strong Built (Mining) Development Corporation** (Strong Built), using ₱5 billion worth of newly issued shares of BHDI. Strong Built is a magnetite iron sind minder that has a mineral production sharing agreement that expires in seven years.
>    - ***MB:*** This has always been a weird deal. This is technically a “reverse takeover”, where Strong Built’s owners are buying BHDI using their Strong Built shares as payment. On the surface, that’s a tautological and strange move to make. From BKR’s perspective, the newly issued shares to Strong Built will almost entirely dilute BKR’s ownership of BHDI. They’ll be left with just under 3% of BHDI’s common stock once this deal is completed. From BKR’s perspective, there really isn’t much to cheer about here. But things change when you look at this from Strong Built’s perspective. By using their shares to purchase overwhelming control of BHDI, they’ve gained ownership of a shell that can be used for future fundraising efforts. Usually with subsidiaries like BHDI you’re thinking about the possibility of an IPO by way of introduction (which is basically like doing an IPO using a property dividend of shares of the subsidiary), but this case is a little different because the potential source listed company (BKR) is only a tiny shareholder of BHDI. That doesn’t necessarily make an “IPO by intro” impossible, but it makes it kind of weird since the resulting shareholding structure probably wouldn’t have a sufficient public float. Something is up with this Martin Romauldez-owned stock, though, because the price has increased more than 85% since November. Are these knowledgeable insiders buying up the stock ahead of some bigger deal, or were these buyers caught trying to predict something that didn’t come to pass? It’s hard to say, but BKR is down 20% from its peak price of ₱1.58 that it hit last week, so maybe this reverse takeover isn’t what those buyers quite had in mind. I feel like we don’t know enough about this yet to say, though. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to let me know! I’m curious to hear what you think is going on here, and why.

>- **[UPDATE]  Synergy Grid has no knowledge of Maharlika Wealth Fund terms...** **Synergy Grid** [SGP 13.12 ▼0.3%; 62% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=7a00c74ed392284bec6e1601ccee8f59)], the holding company for National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), responded to the Bilyonaryo article I covered yesterday to say that SGP “has no information or knowledge on [the matter]”, and that NGCP “has not received any formal correspondence from the Maharlika Wealth Fund regarding any investment into NGCP.” The Bilyonaryo article referenced insiders who claimed that the **Maharlika Wealth Fund** was seeking up to four board seats on NGCP, and that NGCP owners **Big Boy Sy** and **Robert Coyiuto** were not willing to sell more than 20% of NGCP to the fund.
>    - ***MB:*** There are several angles here. The first is that news from unnamed sources will always be “loose”; without knowing who the source is, it’s impossible to tell how fresh their knowledge might be. What might have been true to the source at the time the source gained the knowledge might not be an accurate representation of the deal now, especially if the source is the mythical law office photocopy clerk. With that in mind, though, Bilyo has come out on top seemingly more often than not in disputes with companies over the accuracy of its information from unnamed sources. The second angle here is one of semantics. It’s interesting that SGP would say that it has “no information or knowledge” of what the source was talking about in the Bilyo article, but that’s not what SGP said about NGCP’s management team. For NGCP’s team, all SGP would say is that NGCP hasn’t received any “formal correspondence” from Maharlika Wealth Fund. Maybe it’s just my rusty legal skills, but it feels like SGP’s statement doesn’t mean that Bilyo’s sources are wrong. There’s a world where Maharlika reps spoke directly with NGCP representatives over the phone (informal correspondence) or in person (informal correspondence) about the terms discussed in the Bilyo article, and it’s even possible that the parties met and had substantial negotiations about those terms, but that Maharlika had simply not yet sent a signed written letter (on letterhead) to NGCP to formalize the correspondence. In that world, SGP’s statements would still be accurate (though misleading in a practical sense) and Bilyo’s sources would still be accurate. The third angle is that SGP’s statement says that it has received no formal correspondence from the Maharlika Wealth Fund, but there is no formal entity called the “Maharlika Wealth Fund”. There’s the **Maharlika Investment Fund**, which is the actual pool of money that can be invested, and then there’s the **Maharlika Investment Corporation**, which is the government-owned and government-controlled state body that is responsible for managing the Maharlika Investment Fund. Is this sloppy/lazy drafting from SGP, or is this clever pseudo-sloppy drafting from SGP?

>- **[QUESTION]  Can I get rich with REITs?...** Short answer: no. But baby it’s not you, it’s just the math. Now, we can get bogged down on arguments of what it means to be “rich”, or whether the question is really talking about passive income more than it’s talking about net worth, but I’m going to save all of that detail for other blogs to cover. According to some surveys, to be in the top 10% of income, you need to earn ₱60k to ₱70k per month (or more), and to be in the top 1% of income earners you need to earn ₱150k to ₱200k per month (or more). Of course, with something like weather, temperature outside can be 35C, but there’s a difference between 35C with 80% humidity and a light wind, and 35C with 100% humidity and no wind at all. That 35C can “feel like” 40C in a hurry. Income is like this as well. There’s a difference between earning ₱50k/mo while living at home in Tarlac and earning ₱50/mo while living on your own in Makati. That ₱50k/mo can start to “feel like” ₱20k. But let’s forget all of that. Let’s just try to get into the top 10%. Using REITs, what do we need? Well, we need to generate at least ₱60k (gross, before tax) per month. Let’s convert that to a quarterly figure (x3) which is ₱180k, and an annual figure (x12) which is ₱720k. Forgetting about the capital appreciation (or depreciation -- amiright, DDMPR?) side of REITs for a second (that’s not income-related; we’re focused on the dividends which will be converted into money in our pockets), the highest-yielding REIT right now is VREIT with an estimated annualized yield of 9.93%. The lowest-yielding REIT is AREIT with an estimated annualized yield of 5.82%. That means if we invested ₱10,000 in VREIT today we’d hope to earn ₱993 in dividends this year, and if we invested ₱10,000 in AREIT today, we’d expect to earn ₱582 in divs. Of course, these annualized yields are just guesses based on past performance, and past performance does not guarantee future performance. We can’t be certain that these REITs will continue to payout at these levels. Many REITs have seen their dividends fall off significantly, like DDMPR, FILRT, and PREIT. Many have seen their dividends grow over time, like AREIT, RCR, MREIT, CREIT, and VREIT. Ok, so what initial investment into AREIT or VREIT would it take to get our annual dividend income up to the ₱720k/year we need to qualify for top 10% income? For AREIT, we’d need to own ₱12.4 million worth of stock. For VREIT, we’d need to own ₱7.3 million worth of stock. That’s the basic problem: REITs (and interest-generating investment options) are just one tool that a person can use to generate wealth, but they themselves are not the thing the wealthy use (or even could use) to become wealthy. If you have ₱12 million to dump into REITs, you’re already doing great, and you probably already earn a salary that puts you in the top 10% of income earners (even mostly likely into the low single digits). REITs are a great way to generate some income, to reduce the ravages of inflation, to diversify your portfolio, and to gain exposure to certain real estate types without having to actually own property.
>    - ***MB:*** To me, some REITs (not all REITs) operate the way that a stablecoin like Tether (USDT) or USDC might in the crypto space; they’re a way to lock-in gains from my more risky investments in a way that keeps the money “in the market” and available should a better opportunity arise. They’re not exactly the same thing (stablecoins are configured to remain pegged to the US Dollar, whereas REIT valuations fluctuate), and this analysis ignores the massive impact of what could happen to your investment due to shifts in the underlying price of the REIT, but the comparison is helpful to frame REITs properly as a helpful tool for passive income generation rather than as a cheat code for entrance into the top levels of wealth. As I hope this example has shown, you need to already have a massive pile of cash (₱7 million to ₱12 million) to even own enough REITs to hope to generate enough cash to make the equivalent of ₱60k/month, and that’s an ask that is beyond the reach of all but a select few. REITs are a great saving tool, but as with any saving tool, the income you generate to put into the tool is (by orders of magnitude) more important. If you currently make less than ₱60k/mo, I guarantee you will make bigger monthly gains by reducing your expenses and figuring out other ways to increase your income than you will putting some portion of your income into REITs. I love REITs, they’re just not a magic bullet!

"BTC keeps Rallying, Trump to make Crypto a priority, XRP hits ATH",bitfate,1i7bvp9,2025-01-22 09:08:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i7bvp9/btc_keeps_rallying_trump_to_make_crypto_a/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨Just IN: Trump to Make Crypto a US National Priority

In a move that is sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to designate cryptocurrency as a national priority. This announcement has sparked significant optimism among crypto enthusiasts, with Bitcoin (BTC) surging past the $100,000 mark to hit a record high of $108,244 ahead of Trump's inauguration.

The upcoming executive order aims to guide government agencies to work closely with the crypto industry and establish a crypto advisory council. This council will give industry insiders a voice within the administration, ensuring their concerns and perspectives are heard. Trump's campaign promises, including the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and the appointment of crypto advocates to key regulatory positions, have bolstered investor confidence in digital assets.

BTC's dominance in the cryptocurrency market is expected to continue, driven by its strong appeal among investors. The possibility of the US government creating a national Bitcoin stockpile, using its existing $20 billion in confiscated BTC holdings, has further fueled the price surge.

In other crypto news, XRP has hit a new all-time high, with ETF approval odds rising to 70%. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is considering a possible inflation cut, with predictions that SOL could hit $6,638 by 2030. Phantom has raised $150 million at a $3 billion valuation, and Tether's CEO is planning a cautious US expansion.

Coinbase has restarted BTC-backed loans on Base, and Bessent has opposed the idea of a US Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Lummis has accused the FDIC of failing in crypto oversight, while Wintermute suggests a DOGE ETF could be possible in 2025. Nasdaq has applied to list a Litecoin ETF, and Swiss bank PostFinance has launched ETH staking services.

In India, Jio has launched a mystery JioCoin on the Polygon network, adding another layer of intrigue to the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

Coinbase to Delist USDT?

Coinbase might hit the ""bye-bye"" button on $USDT if new U.S. rules demand stricter compliance. Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, said they’re ready to delist Tether if regulations require stablecoins to back their reserves entirely with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo full-blown audits. Talk about high stakes!

Here’s the tea: While Tether does hold a chunk of its reserves in Treasury bonds, it also throws in commodities like $BTC and gold. That might not fly with the future rules looming over the U.S. crypto skies. And let’s not forget — Tether's already had some EU drama thanks to the MiCA framework. Looks like stablecoins might have to play by much stricter rules worldwide. 

Coinbase, on the other hand, seems to be sipping its $USDC tea comfortably as it cozies up to Circle, the issuer of $USDC. If Tether falters, Circle might just snag more market share. Hmm, things are looking spicy for both $USDC and Ripple’s stablecoin, $RLUSD, which already has some cheeky rumors swirling around Trump’s closed-door Ripple meetings. Could $RLUSD swoop in to shake things up if Tether stumbles? Time will tell.

And let’s not even get started on $BTC — blasting through to a new ATH of 109k! But hey, all this regulatory talk has everyone feeling a mix of thrill and a lil’ bit of panic. Big things are happening, sugar, so hold on tight for the ride!

Breakdown of my decision to hold after putting in $5k at $66,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i6mjyz,2025-01-21 11:30:22,98,0.99,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i6mjyz/breakdown_of_my_decision_to_hold_after_putting_in/,CampCrate,Speculation ,"Like many, I got in at a bad price point. I've heavily debated cutting my losses because I rarely take a speculative investment like this. I'm holding though, and this is why:

1. Rug pull concerns: There is evidence of large whales selling the coin, with over $74 million worth dumped. While this raises concerns, it doesn’t necessarily mean this is a full-on rug pull. The sharp drop seems to be tied to panic selling and broader market behavior rather than an orchestrated pump-and-dump scheme. This isn’t a total rug pull... yet.  However, the risk remains.

2. [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1771146/000199937125000494/rexosprey-485apos_012125.htm): This filing is for an ETF that tracks Trump coin. It’s subject to approval, but it sheds light on potential plans for a supportive regulatory environment that could attract institutional investors, with Trump coin positioned front and center.  It's unlikely they would submit an SEC filing if the plan was pump and dump.

3. BTC/TRUMP tracking: As the attached image shows, the sharp sell-off aligns closely with Bitcoin’s drop yesterday. This suggests the ""rug pull"" narrative may be overstated, as Trump coin appears to track Bitcoin’s movements, albeit with larger swings and less so this morning. Its fate will likely hinge on broader crypto market trends, which are showing promise.

4. Trump's ego: One of the most powerful and greedy men in the world with one of the largest egos was briefly the 25th wealthiest person in the world, 3-4xing his net worth in a matter of days (from $5.6B to $22B). Despite not mentioning crypto in his inauguration and the price dropping, he got a taste. He'll do everything in his power to restore it.

5. External financial influence: This is a public coin that can be bought and sold by anyone, including foreign governments or lobbyists. If a large portion of Trump’s net worth is tied to the coin, its price could be manipulated to influence his decisions. With a market cap of $7.6 billion, even modest investments from wealthy entities like Saudi families, with $1 trillion+ net worth alone, could pump the coin for strategic or influential purposes.

6. Exchange Listings:  Crypto exchanges are currently purchasing coins so they can list it on their exchanges.  As Coinbase,  Kraken, Bitfinex, etc. adopt it, volatility and market cap will increase.

This is why I’m holding. Admittedly I'm subject to the sunk cost fallacy.  There’s substantial risk, no doubt, but there are also too many unique factors in play to dismiss this entirely.  I'm far from a Trump enthusiast, but this isn't the Huak Tuah coin.  Do I reccomend putting more than 1-5% of your holdings into this?  Absolutely not.  Do I think it has potential to rebound?  Yes!

The next few days are crucial for the crypto markets at large. It is important to pay attention to price, but USDT.D can sometimes give you a clearer few of the market considering the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Here's a picture of USDT.D'a weekly frame. How this closes is incredibly crucial. If we close with a green (blue) candle, with this long wick at the bottom, we could have marked a top for this cycle.

Similarities to 2021 include the incredible gambling nature of this market. While the cryptocurrency market is naturally inclined for degenerates with its liberal access to leverage and memecoins, I'd argue that greed and optimism are at a very high level. An all encompassing crypto pump that gets ""famous"" and ends up in a rug is a nice parallel to the 2021 market. Doge = TrumpCoin

Let's monitor the markets together and see how things go. We'll have a clearer picture in the coming days and weeks."

This thing is called **VAC.** All you need is to watch movie trailers and evaluate them.

Here is the link with referral code.

And, here is without it.

[https://h5.visionaryaicinema.vip/](https://h5.visionaryaicinema.vip/)

Once you sign up, you start with level : LV0. You watch trailers and they pay you $1 each. You can watch 3times a day, and lasts 3days.

Here is the details.

[https://imgur.com/a/2KRbLWi](https://imgur.com/a/2KRbLWi)

After you finish it, you can proceed to LV1 or LV2. They are not free. You have to purchase membership.

I started with LV1. Because I wanted to earn money, not to spent.

But you can start with LV2, or buy LV1 and LV2 memberships both at the same time. So you can make $10.4 every day. That is what I am doing right now.

However, here is a tricky part.

All of the currency they use is USDT(Tether). That is a Cryptocurrency values same as USD. You will have to go to another platform such as Bybit to buy USDT in order to pay for membership in VAC. And when they pay you, it will also be in USDT that you will have to exchange that to whatever your currency is.

It was little complicated. But I was able to do that.

If you need help on that I can tell you how I managed to do that.

Oh, I almost forgot. VAC also has referral programs. They are pretty amazing. You may want to check them out too.

Short term targets are $0.135 then $0.16

2. Flips $BONK
3. Reaches $10B valuation, ($1.00)

I see that USDT gives you 9% base, while others like USDC, USDP or TUSD give you 8% base, why the difference if both are stablecoins?

  
I was considering divesting from USDT but now I am not so sure hahah, do any of you guys perceive any chance of depegging or regulatory issues with Tether?"

Designing a btc trading strategy for tradingview.,TradingView,1i3juyk,2025-01-17 11:11:57,38,0.89,15,https://i.redd.it/qepmk6xawkde1.jpeg,AdZestyclose5294,Discussion,"So I've been working on creating a strategy specifically for btc  longs and shorts using 10-20x leverage. I am fairly new to pine script but have so far developed 400+ line strategy that seems to be highly accurate for the 15 minute chart. Since I am new to designing a tradingview strategy I have concerns that I'm not testing it correctly. What are some things I need to take into consideration to achieve accurate testing like slippage etc? Current testing technicals are -  free tradingview account, last 3 months worth of 15 minute bars tested resulting in 24.95% gains over 23 trades with 100% profitability, n/a profit factor as there is no losses, max drawdown 2.35% with an average trade of 1.09% and 37 average bars in trade with slippage tick set for 300. Now with this said if I change to 500 ticks the statistics are as follows - 24.85% net profit, 23 trades, 95.65% profitability, 6,469 profit factor (6 thousand yes) 2.35% max drawdown, 1.08% gain per trade average with 37 bars average trade. I have a dynamic trailing stop-loss set to 0.6% reverse movement threshold and a fixed stop-loss for inital trades set to -3% (which was not hit in any trade with either slippage setting) I am curious if my slippage is unrealistic or if there is anything I should be taking into consideration. I will soon pay for premium tradingview so I can back test in all market conditions."
