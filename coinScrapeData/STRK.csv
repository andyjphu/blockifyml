The code never lies, and it tells a story of who‚Äôs actually building versus just hyping. According to Santiment‚Äôs latest data, **Internet Computer (#ICP)** is crushing it at #1, with **Chainlink (#LINK)** and **Hedera (#HBAR)** hot on its heels.

What stands out? Projects like **Starknet (#STRK)** and **Optimism (#OP)**‚Äîthey‚Äôre grinding hard on scaling solutions, while old-school favorites like **Polkadot (#DOT)** and **Cardano (#ADA)** still hold their ground. But **sUSD (#SUSD)** sneaking into the Top 10? That‚Äôs a plot twist. Are we underestimating stablecoins as innovation drivers? Maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink the narrative.

Over on Starknet, staking for the STRK token has officially launched, ushering in its transformation into a Proof-of-Stake network. Delegators, gear up‚Äîthis is your time to shine. 

Lastly, the Stacks Foundation is set to unveil the timeline for the release of sBTC, a Bitcoin-backed asset aimed at revolutionizing BTC‚Äôs role in DeFi. And speaking of BTC, the king of crypto inches closer to that legendary $100K mark. Are we about to witness history?

Blockchain protocols and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) generally advocate for on-chain activity, arguing it's the most ideal. However, in practice, many of us still conduct voting off-chain. We often rely on Web2 operators to facilitate our free spaces, which can be frustrating. Starknet (STRK) has faced similar challenges, mirroring those across other blockchain spaces. While I‚Äôve long desired permissionless on-chain voting for governance from the very beginning, it has yet to materialize. **Gas Fee Dilemma and Voter Participation** To date, DAO and protocol governance have forced us to choose between two difficult options: off-chain voting for lower costs and inclusivity, or on-chain voting that upholds principles but comes with high gas fees that deter participation. Decentralization with high voter participation costs isn't the future we envision. Voting is one of the most effective ways to influence decision-making. However, Web3 infrastructure has yet to fully support the on-chain voting experience as imagined. When voting occurs as a transaction on the blockchain, associated gas fees can become prohibitively expensive, silencing many who should have a voice because they cannot afford the fees. Imagine paying $10 to participate in a general election‚Äîvoter turnout would drop significantly. **Temporary Solution: Off-Chain Governance** The easier option is off-chain governance, which is nearly free and adaptable to specific needs but relies on a trusted third party to facilitate it. This compromise has been reluctantly accepted by decentralization pioneers, including myself at Starknet. However, we are addressing this on September 10 when the next round of Starknet voting begins. Snapshot, which has facilitated most off-chain DAO voting to date, will introduce a new era by offering easy and free on-chain voting for users. This vote will launch staking on Starknet. **Snapshot X: A Step Forward for On-Chain Voting** The newly built Snapshot X is based on Starknet, though I would be just as happy if it were built elsewhere. What matters is the idea behind it, not the brand building it. It‚Äôs important to recognize that this is a gradual step forward. Blockchain doesn‚Äôt instantly solve all problems. For instance, a small group of people can still push through proposals that may not be widely desired. Activism will persist regardless of the technology. However, on-chain voting is crucial as it highlights the unique governance potential of blockchain. It also counters the criticism that crypto tokens lack intrinsic value. In off-chain voting, operators weigh votes based on the number of tokens held (e.g., 100 tokens give 100 votes). On-chain voting represents the highest form of democracy. Every token automatically carries weight by being placed in the protocol without intermediaries. As a result, both insiders and outsiders will see that tokens aren‚Äôt just for trading‚Äîthey are central to Web3 democracy. **Blockchain‚Äôs Real-World Potential** I care about on-chain voting because it preserves blockchain culture, and I believe it's important for broader society. Call me a dreamer, but I still believe in collective power and that blockchain pioneers can set a shining example for the world beyond Web3, encouraging new ways of doing things. Blockchain could emerge as a useful tool in the real world. Have you ever received a proxy ballot in your mailbox after the voting deadline? It‚Äôs a common issue. Imagine how many more investors would participate if there was an almost free, verifiable option with a user-friendly smartphone app. **On-Chain Voting: Transparency and Security** This is what blockchain can enable today. People fear electronic voting for its lack of transparency, where voters cannot see how their votes are recorded or counted, and there‚Äôs no physical record of their participation. But if there were an unhackable, verifiable method where voters felt confident that they could visit a digital space where votes are cast and counted simultaneously, on-chain voting could become one of the revolutionary technologies to achieve this. This, in my view, is the essence of blockchain‚Äîproviding certainty that crucial tasks are conducted with integrity. This might be the seed that will grow into on-chain voting at the national level for democracies everywhere. While today‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt quite enough to make this happen soon, the human spirit of innovation could change everything. Before we get there‚Äîif we get there‚Äîit‚Äôs vital that blockchain leaders prove that our own governance systems align with what we preach. Consider this a call to action: let‚Äôs make every token count, on-chain.

Snapshot Revolutionizes DAO Voting: Launches On-Chain Platform Using Starknet,iotatokennews,1fclo9p,2024-09-09 05:55:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/iotatokennews/comments/1fclo9p/snapshot_revolutionizes_dao_voting_launches/,iotatokennews,,"Snapshot Revolutionizes DAO Voting: Launches On-Chain Platform Using Starknet

### Revolutionizing Digital Governance:‚Äå The Launch‚Äç of Snapshot X

In the ‚Å¢dynamic world ‚Å¢of decentralized networks, a cutting-edge advancement is‚Å¢ shaping the ‚Å¢future‚Äç of digital democracy. Snapshot Labs, renowned‚Äç for its seminal‚Äç off-chain voting mechanism embraced by nearly all decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) ‚Äçincluding prominent DeFi leaders Lido and Aave, ‚Äãis set to ‚Äãintroduce a blockchain-based ‚Äåalternative through Starknet‚Äôs Ethereum layer-2 network.

Pioneering‚Äç Blockchain Governance with Storage ProofsThis innovative governance solution, dubbed Snapshot X, leverages groundbreaking storage proofs technology pioneered by StarkWare. This cryptographic breakthrough facilitates asset verification on‚Äã one ‚Å£blockchain while negating the necessity for ‚Å£third-party‚Å§ intervention to transfer those‚Äå assets to another chain. This ‚Äçnot only enhances security but also significantly reduces costs associated with cross-chain transactions.

Storage proofs enable an environment ‚Äçwhere asset ownership ‚Äãcan be irrefutably verified across different blockchains without the‚Äã need to physically move tokens or incur hefty gas fees. When users partake in voting‚Å¢ via Snapshot X, they send a proof ‚Å¢of their token holdings from a tier-1 blockchain that the system thoroughly authenticates. With this confirmation process in place on Snapshot‚Äå X‚Äôs contract interface, it ensures that user claims about their holdings are accurate and tamper-proof.

Governance ‚ÄåExpansion Through Starknet Community InvolvementIn its debut venture into community-driven decision-making processes slated for‚Å§ this week, Snapshot X will‚Äã facilitate its inaugural vote concerning‚Å¢ starkly revolutionary proposals ‚Å£on Starknet itself. ‚ÄãFrom‚Äå September 10th to 13th, holders of ‚ÄåSTRK tokens will participate in determining the framework for Starknet‚Äôs fresh staking mechanisms at a ‚Å£specially crafted governance portal‚Äã developed explicitly for Snapshot X interactions.

### Bridging Platforms and ‚ÄãCommunities

The integration between traditional chain‚Äç activities and next-generation blockchain capabilities exemplifies how technology is transforming governance models within modern DAO structures. It presents an exemplary case study of how decentralized platforms‚Å£ can‚Äã offer not ‚Äåonly complete transparency but also unparalleled efficiency amidst escalating digital transformations across various sectors.

As we edge closer towards more integrated‚Å§ blockchain ecosystems through‚Å£ innovations like ‚Å§those demonstrated by‚Äå Snapshot Labs via their latest‚Äå project with Starkware‚Äôs ‚ÄçStarkNet deployment ‚Äî it becomes clearer that these technological strides‚Äã are pivotal in reshaping participatory engagement ‚Äçacross digitally native‚Äã landscapes‚Äîpropelling them toward heightened accountability and operational effectiveness which were previously challenging within classical frameworks.

Service Post: how to claim your StarkNet (STRK) as a minipool operator (ends June 20),rocketpool,1dc1xdi,2024-06-09 15:28:21,20,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/1dc1xdi/service_post_how_to_claim_your_starknet_strk_as_a/,Cornlinger,Node Operator,"TL;DR: Rocket Pool minipool operators eligible for the StarkNet airdrop (validators pre-merge or pre-genesis) can claim their StarkNet tokens through their withdrawal address (needs to be able to sign). The airdrop ends on June 20.

Long version:  
I did a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/1ar2gew/starknet_any_chance_to_claim_with_rocket_pool/) about four months ago that the Starknet airdrop isn't compatible to Rocket Pool and if anyone knows how to claim. No solution back then. I checked a few times over the past months but then let go and set up a reminder 14 days prior the end of the airdrop (June 20).

Yesterday, I realized that the devs have fixed the problem and sent something [on X](https://x.com/StarknetFndn/status/1783050200384250203) about it, but without any instructions whatsoever. I then checked and found out the withdrawal address I set up for my minipool is now eligible for the airdrop. So if you're a minipool operator since pre-merge or converted your pre-merge (or even pre-genesis) validators to minipools, like I did, check if your withdrawal address is now eligible for the StarkNet airdrop. You can check and claim your tokens through their provisions portal here: [https://provisions.starknet.io/](https://provisions.starknet.io/)

I know, for quite a few of you this might be old news, but I'm also pretty sure I'm not the only one nearly missing thousands of free $ as the fix wasn't as widespread as the original airdrop announcement. So hoping this helps someone claim some STRK in time! üòâ"

AVNU‚Äôs newly launched Paymaster feature aims to transform the way users interact with gas fees on Starknet, potentially making gas fees a thing of the past.

AVNU‚Äôs Paymaster, currently in beta, introduces a novel approach to paying gas fees on Starknet. While traditionally users could only pay gas fees using¬†[Ethereum (ETH)¬†](https://blockchainreporter.net/price-prediction/ethereum-price-prediction/)or Starknet‚Äôs native token (STRK), the Paymaster now allows payments in stablecoins USDC and USDT. This feature is not just an addition but a transformative step towards abstracting gas fees entirely.

My wallet is on an offline machine and I am usually using the MyEtherWallet offline method to sign transactions.

It would be cool if anyone could explain, how I would use my offline wallet to sign this interaction with the smart contract.

I realize that this is not really a staking-specific topic, but I am trying my luck here anyways.

Options for solo staking in the cloud,ethstaker,1brppp2,2024-03-30 15:12:54,9,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/1brppp2/options_for_solo_staking_in_the_cloud/,davebrophy,,"The starknet airdrop gave 1800 STRK (\~$4000) to each ""solo staker"" node, but only 360 STRK (\~$800) to ""pool staker"" nodes.

I understand EC2 isn't the best option for solo staking because of centralisation concerns, but I'd like to stick to one of the larger cloud provides that I can trust.

I found some great instructions for Google Cloud, but the ""Blockchain Node Engine"" service on it's own costs $0.69/hr ($500/month)...

What are the costs of other options?

Alternatively, are there any ""saas staking"" services that look to the outside world like ""solo staking"" (e.g. for the purposes of future airdrops)?"
