Cause it would explain maybe why Max denied knowing Casey. Or did I miss something?
It would be like a Romeo and Juliet type deal since the Goodwins and Landry‚Äôs don‚Äôt really get along. "
Jacob‚Äôs Dream Symbolism *Spoilers for S3E4*,TheWayHomeHallmark,1i9wq6w,2025-01-25 15:52:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1i9wq6w/jacobs_dream_symbolism_spoilers_for_s3e4/,IndependentIcy1220,Theories,"At the beginning of Season 3 Episode 4, Little Boy Jacob and Colton were shown camping out in a tent that was set up in the field next to their house.

Jacob was wearing star and moon pajamas and he was scared that ""something out there would get them.""

Colton then assured Jacob that ""sleeping out here under the stars, is just pure magic"" and that ""nothing can hurt you out here Jakey, I promise.""

They go to sleep and then in the morning, Little Boy Jacob gets up, runs through the field to the house and opens the door.

The dream then switches and Little Boy Jacob becomes Adult Jacob, who is now opening the door to the 1814 Landry's home, and calling for his ""father.""

And instead of his loving father, Jacob finds a man that very well can and did hurt him, Cyrus Goodwin, sitting at the Landry's kitchen table. 

Cyrus then tells Jacob that ""your family is gone, you left them...with me.""

My question now is, was the sequence where Little Boy Jacob and Colton were camping an actual memory that Jacob incorporated into his dream or was the whole thing just fabricated to show that Jacob is still grappling with the man he was in 1814 versus the man he could have been if he had been allowed to grow up in the present?

On to the symbolism of Jacob's dream.

**The White Witch Myth**

Little Boy Jacob was afraid that something ""out there"" would get him, this could apply to many different things like wild animals and such, but in the context of the show, I wonder if Jacob was afraid that a ""White Witch"" or the pond would get him. 

Boy Jacob was well aware of the ""White Witch"" myth, about a woman dressed in white that goes around stealing children, because he was the one that first told Alice about it in Season 1.

And Colton had warned Boy Jacob a few times to stay away from the pond, because it wasn't safe. 

So Boy Jacob's fears were well founded and he had every right to be afraid of the pond, after what it did to him. 

As for the White Witch, that remains to be seen, because we haven't seen how the myth of the White Witch stealing children began yet. 

The only White Witch instance we have is that Kat and Susanna dressed as ""White Witches"" to confuse Cyrus Goodwin so Thomas could move Jacob to safety in Season 2.

We also have Teen Evelyn Goodwin in Season 3, that dresses and looks very similar to Kat's White Witch attire. And that Teen Evelyn believes that the ""White Witch,"" is a helper of people not a malevolent figure. 

And we also have Grandma Fern who was dressed in a white nightgown and singing strange songs probably related to the pond. 

**Stars**

Once again Jacob is shown being associated with stars, as his pajamas were covered in stars and a moon. 

This is symbolic of how in Season 1, Kat and Jacob fell on Jacob's bed and were talking about the glow-in-the-dark stars that adorned Jacob's ceiling and how Jacob told Kat that ""explorer's used the stars to guide them home.""

**Colton's Promise to Jacob**

Colton promised Boy Jacob that ""nothing can hurt you out here Jakey.""

This is symbolic because the pond did hurt Jacob. He was taken from his original Landry family and sent back to 1790 to be raised by another Landry family. 

Then as an adult, he began smuggling which got him into trouble with Cyrus Goodwin, who had him beaten and tortured almost to death. 

And then the pond let Jacob return to 2025, where he is having to grapple with the man he was in 1814 versus the man he could have become if he'd been allowed to stay in the present timeline. 

Also, Colton's line wasn't even true for himself, because he was killed while trying to avoid hitting his own granddaughter on a lonely stretch of road right in front of the Landry's house. 

**Boy Jacob leaving the tent and opening the door where he became Adult Jacob**

Season 3 Episode 4 had some very good cinematography, those scenes at Lingermore, that started with Jacob's Dream sequence. 

It was so symbolic of Little Boy Jacob leaving the tent that he was sharing with his dad Colton, only to run to his house and open the door, where it was revealed to be Adult Jacob opening the door in 1814, who was looking for his ""Father"" Elijah. 

That scene was so well done and really encapsulated Jacob's story arc of having been and still being ""caught between two different worlds.""

# Upgrade Your Python Toolbox for 2025: Discover the Essential Libraries You‚Äôre Missing Out On

Python‚Äôs powerful, but your tools can make you a coding god or a frustrated mess.¬†*Don‚Äôt be that developer stuck using outdated tools while the rest of the world is speeding ahead*

**Many**¬†developers are still heavily reliant on libraries like Pandas, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, but these aren‚Äôt always the most efficient solutions for modern development needs. In this article, we‚Äôll explore some of the top emerging Python libraries for 2025 that will supercharge your development process and help you stay ahead of the curve.

# A) Outdated Libraries and Better Replacements

# 1. Ditch OS For File Operations: Use pathlib

The os module is often cumbersome for file and path handling due to¬†*issues like*¬†***platform-specific***¬†*path separators and*¬†***verbose syntax***\*.\*¬†pathlib simplifies this with intuitive object-oriented methods like for joining paths,¬†.exists(), and¬†.is\_file() for checks, making cross-platform compatibility seamless. With its cleaner syntax and built-in features, pathlib eliminates the need for manual adjustments, becoming the go-to solution for modern Python developers

# Example:

    from pathlib import Path
    
    
    # Creating a file
    file = Path(""example.txt"")
    file.write_text(""Hello, Pathlib!"")
    
    
    # Reading the file
    print(file.read_text())
    
    
    # Checking existence
    if file.exists():
        print(""File exists"")

# Why Switch?

`pathlib`¬†just makes life easier. It‚Äôs more intuitive than¬†`os`, with its object-oriented approach to working with files and paths. You won‚Äôt have to worry about platform-specific issues (like¬†`\`¬†vs¬†`/`) because¬†`pathlib`¬†handles all that for you. Plus, the syntax is cleaner and more readable.

# 2. Replace Requests with¬†httpx:¬†A Modern HTTP Client for Asynchronous and Synchronous Requests

`HTTPS`¬†has emerged as a powerful¬†**alternative to requests**, especially in 2025. Unlike¬†`requests`, HTTPX also offers¬†**HTTP/2 support**, which can dramatically reduce latency and improve request handling by allowing multiplexed connections.¬†`httpx`‚Äîa modern alternative that supports async operations without sacrificing the simplicity and familiarity of the Requests API.

# Example:

    import httpx
    import asyncio
    # asyncio is used to enable asynchronous programming, 
    # and it's integral to httpx for non-blocking HTTP requests.
    # With httpx, you can use async/await syntax to run multiple HTTP requests concurrently.
    
    
    # Demonstrating Asynchronous Requests with httpx
    async def async_get_data():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""Async Response:"", response.json())
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the asynchronous request
    asyncio.run(async_get_data())
    
    # Asynchronous HTTP/2 Request with httpx
    async def async_http2_request():
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(http2=True) as client:
            response = await client.get('https://http2.golang.org/reqinfo')
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(""HTTP/2 Response:"", response.text)
            else:
                print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the HTTP/2 request
    asyncio.run(async_http2_request())
    
    # Connection Pooling with httpx Client
    def connection_pooling_example():
        with httpx.Client(keep_alive=True) as client:
            url = ""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1""
            # Multiple requests using connection pooling
            for _ in range(5):
                response = client.get(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    print(""Response Content:"", response.text)
                else:
                    print(f""Error: {response.status_code}"")
    
    # Run the connection pooling example
    connection_pooling_example()

# Why Use¬†httpx?

If you‚Äôre working on applications that demand¬†**high concurrency**, such as web scraping or microservices, HTTPX‚Äôs support for¬†**asynchronous operations**¬†offers significant performance improvements.

>

Essentially, if you're working with a lot of I/O,¬†`httpx`¬†will save you a lot of headaches.

# 3. **Move Beyond Pandas: Use Polars

`Pandas`is perfect for small to mid-sized datasets, but when you throw larger datasets at it, the memory usage and performance starts to suffer.

>

`Polars`¬†is a modern,¬†**memory-efficient**, and¬†**multi-threaded data processing Rust-based backend library**¬†that provides a¬†**faster alternative to Pandas**¬†for large datasets. Unlike¬†**Pandas**, Polars supports¬†**parallel processing**, which speeds up¬†**data manipulation**¬†tasks

# Example:

    import polars as pl
    
    # Create a Polars DataFrame from a dictionary with sample data
    data = pl.DataFrame({
        ""name"": [""Alice"", ""Bob"", ""Charlie"", ""David""],
        ""age"": [25, 30, 35, 40],
        ""salary"": [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000]
    })
    
    print(""Original DataFrame:"")
    print(data)
    # Output:
    # shape: (4, 3)
    # ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    # ‚îÇ name    ‚îÜ age ‚îÜ salary ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ ---     ‚îÜ --- ‚îÜ ---    ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ str     ‚îÜ i64 ‚îÜ i64    ‚îÇ
    # ‚ïû‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï°
    # ‚îÇ Alice   ‚îÜ 25  ‚îÜ 50000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ Bob     ‚îÜ 30  ‚îÜ 60000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ Charlie ‚îÜ 35  ‚îÜ 70000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ David   ‚îÜ 40  ‚îÜ 80000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
    # This shows the original DataFrame with 4 rows and 3 columns: ""name"", ""age"", ""salary""
    
    # Perform lazy evaluation to prepare for filtering, sorting, and selecting data
    result = (
        data.lazy()  # Converts the DataFrame to a lazy query, operations will not be executed yet
        .filter(pl.col(""age"") > 30)  # Filter rows where age > 30 (Charlie, David)
        .sort(""salary"", reverse=True)  # Sort by salary in descending order (David first, Charlie second)
        .select([""name"", ""salary""])  # Select only ""name"" and ""salary"" columns
        .collect()  # Trigger computation and get the result
    )
    
    print(""\nFiltered, Sorted, and Selected Data:"")
    print(result)
    # Output:
    # Filtered, Sorted, and Selected Data:
    # shape: (2, 2)
    # ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    # ‚îÇ name    ‚îÜ salary ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ ---     ‚îÜ ---    ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ str     ‚îÜ i64    ‚îÇ
    # ‚ïû‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï™‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ï°
    # ‚îÇ David   ‚îÜ 80000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îÇ Charlie ‚îÜ 70000  ‚îÇ
    # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
    # This output shows that only two rows (""Charlie"" and ""David"") are left after filtering by age > 30.
    # The rows are sorted by salary in descending order, with ""David"" (salary 80000) appearing first, followed by ""Charlie"" (salary 70000).

# Why¬†Polars?

So, if you‚Äôre dealing with¬†**large-scale data processing**, need¬†**parallel execution**, or want a¬†**memory-efficient**¬†solution,¬†**Polars**¬†is the superior choice for modern data science and analytics..Pandas might be your first love, but¬†`Polars`¬†is the one who can handle the heavy lifting.

# 4. Upgrade Your Testing Game: Replace¬†unittest¬†with¬†pytest

`unittest`? Sure, it works, but come on, it‚Äôs 2025. You ain‚Äôt pulling any bitches with that. It‚Äôs like trying to impress someone with a flip phone when everyone‚Äôs rocking iPhones. Yeah, it works, but it‚Äôs a total hassle.¬†`pytest`\*\*: it‚Äôs the cool, modern testing framework that makes writing and reading tests way easier.\*\*

# Wait, What‚Äôs¬†unittest?

For the uninitiated,¬†`unittest`¬†is Python's built-in testing framework, but it¬†***often feels outdated with verbose syntax and repetitive boilerplate***. With, you get powerful features like flexible fixture management, automatic test discovery, and built-in parameterization (using¬†u/pytest`.mark.parametrize`) to easily run the same test with different inputs. It also supports parallel test execution via¬†`pytest-xdist`, which boosts performance for large test suites.

# Example:

    # test_sample.py
    
    # Importing pytest library for testing
    import pytest
    
    # Simple function to add two numbers
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y  
    
    # Test function to check if add(x, y) returns the correct result
    def test_add():  # Note: function started with ""test_""
        # Checking if 2 + 3 equals 5
        assert add(2, 3) == 5  # If the add function works, this should pass
        # No output is printed because pytest handles the test results automatically
    
    # Expected output after running pytest:
    # ===================== test session starts =====================
    # collected 1 item
    # 
    # test_sample.py .                                        [100%]
    # 
    # ===================== 1 passed in 0.03 seconds =====================

# Why¬†test_?

By using the¬†`test_`¬†prefix, you make it clear to pytest that these functions are supposed to be tests. It‚Äôs part of pytest's convention to discover and run the correct functions without any additional configuration.

Best scenes from stuff that's completely terrible?,TwoBestFriendsPlay,1i9tzon,2025-01-25 13:52:42,18,0.88,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1i9tzon/best_scenes_from_stuff_thats_completely_terrible/,KingMario05,Warning: Anderson Resident Evil ahead,"Title. What's your favorite scene from something that overall, isn't very good, but the scene on its own is pretty damn sweet? Anything works at all, but movies are what I think of when it comes to this.

My pick: The intro to 2010's Sony/Constantin disaster *Resident Evil: Afterlife.* The fourth film in the increasingly-inaccurately named Capcom video game movie series, and the first since 2002 directed by longtime ""writer"" Paul WS Anderson, is a multinational biohazard on almost every level imaginable. Infamous for [the abortive hybrid of *Matrix* and RE5 that they call its ""finale""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPUPaxgIo98), it's an incompetent script with (save for Milla Jovovich) terrible actors and action that beggars suspension of disbelief. The CGI's crap, the green screen/VFX are crap, the pacing is crap, and for 90% of the second act, *nothing even happens.* Yet more proof, for the longest possible time, game movies sucked.

(Music's great, though. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes.)

[This is how it opens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-857aHNCUI) A *hauntingly* beautiful scene of Shibuya falling to the T-virus, just another rain-soaked evening becoming the end of the world in a split-second. No one even *notices* the zombie until she bites; by then, it's too late. Then, after Alice says her spiel, we get an [utterly ***bonkers*** payoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rszg5D3j2c0) to the last film. >!Remember those Alice clones from *Extinction,* the Mad Max ripoff before this? Now they're raiding Umbrella HQ beneath Tokyo. ***And no one gets out alive.*** ...Until Wesker purges the facility in a tiltrotor before sapping the real Alice of her powers!<, lol. 

As you can imagine, it... kinda devolves from there. But hey, pretty cool twenty minute hook, right? 

Just be sure to leave early. *Very* early."

For example, when i went from ruby to terizla, i expected myself to be decent at both, but when i picked ruby after playing terizla for a while, i miss all my hooks and i suddenly keep dying as if my spell vamp doesnt work. Its weird because both are setting exp laners so youd think id be good at both.

As another example, when i moved on to playing more carry heroes like alice and roger, i stopped being able to perform on exp

Now that ive been playing granger, it seems thats all i can play, but interestingly, really old mains like my ruby seemed to work again.

Is this some sort of phenomenon that im unaware of or is it just a skill issue"

I just pulled a ton of ancient shards. I managed to get some great champs. Geomancer, Tagoar, Aox, Apothecary, and Stag Knight seem like the best ones i got according to Hell Hades.

First question. Are any of these rares worth it? I checked Hell Hades. I guess faction wars? Also seems like I could just use them for food and i would be fine? I don't know. I have a bunch more rares and some other epics in the vault but according to Hell Hades they are seem pretty bad and would just be good for faction wars so just leaving them there for now. Don't have enough gear for everything at the moment. I have a few copies of a bunch of champs that are fusion in the vault as well.

  
Right now I have full masteries for Kael, Wukong, and Alice. Khatun is fully booked. Kael is fully booked. Frozen Banshee is fully booked. Wukong and Alice both have a couple books because i was indecisive. 

Right now, i'm doing clan boss on normal with 1 key. I can do hard with 2 keys but average around 7 million. My clan boss team is Frozen Banshee, Kael, Uugo, Rector, and Skeletor. I was thinking a better team would be Frozen Banshee, Kael, Tagoar, Aox, and Geomancer?

  
For arena, I am running Alice, Wukong, Uugo, and Rector. Is there a better combo of these champs that could work better? Currently silver 4-ish.

For all of the dungeons, i'm stuck in the 11-13 range. Most of it is because I'm trying to work out which teams work best. See above post lol.

Lastly, I'm struggling to see where I could use Stag Knight and Apothecary. Am i just dumb?

Appreciate everyone that contributes here because it has certainly helped a lot!"

I know Kael is a popular choice, but his build needs work. I've maxed Elhain's skill, which makes her more effective than Kael right now. Alice has also been good to me, but I don't know if she's a good long term choice.

Any suggestions? Do you see something obvious I haven't considered?"

**If you are here for a question for any of my tech related posts you don't need to read the rest just DM your question.**

****

**Personal stuff**

I'm in my early M20s from Istanbul/Turkey.

I'm around 6'3"" - 6'4"" (I've gotten measured at different hospitals and at the same hospital multiple times they always measure different so I truly don't know)

I've got black, straight but wavy long hair (used to be to my waist) to my shoulders, got no facial hair.

I've got the cutest cat ever.

And I also got the prettiest hands ever haha.

****

**Hobbies, what I like and such**

* **Video games** 

Mainly into *MMORPG/RTS/MOBA* genre but enjoy pretty much everything.


* **Movies** 

I'm just gonna name directors because if I detail it too much this section is just gonna be 200 pages if you wanna chat about movies just DM. In no particular order: *Bergman, Bunuel, Scorsese, Hitchcock, Huston, Tarantino, Pasolini, Welles, Feliini, Ford, Chaplin, Spielberg, Lynch, Wilder, Cappola, Polanski, Leone, Griffith, Coen, Capra* - and with that I can't think more from top of my head I guess that's enough for now :P

* **Music**

Mainly Rock but listen to pretty much everything but I do not really enjoy electronic or techno kinda stuff. As for singer/groups per genre (gotten from my stats for Spotify because it's better than my memory :P) - **Rock**: *Simon & Garfunkel, Johnny Cash, Rodriguez, CCR, Jim Croce, The Doors, The Beatles, The Animals, Elvis, Bryan Adams, Dire Straits, J.J. Cale, David Bowie, The Moody Blues, Billy Joel, Jackson C. Frank, George Harrison, The Mamas & The Papas, Jefferson Airplane, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Buffalo Springfield, Elton John, Queen, Oasis, Nirvana, Steely Dan, Neil Young, The Police, Jethro Tull, Gary Moore, America, Fleetwood Mac, The Zombies, The Turtles* - There's more but I think you got it :) - **Metal**: *Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death, Iron Maiden, Myrath, My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, Anathema, Alice in Chains, System of a Down, Metallica, AC/DC* - again there's more but I think you got it - **Classical**: To be honest all the greats, *Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Vivaldi, Schubert, Handel, Liszt, Haydn, Strauss, Verdi, Brahms, Wagner, Rossini, Ravel, Grieg,  Ravel, Dvor√°k* but I especially enjoy *Bach* and *Mahler* - I'm tired so no more naming for now haha.

I guess naming hobbies is hard? because I don't want to say I'm into astronomy for example and have nothing interesting to talk about it? I don't know. I'll add some stuff in the future here.

**What even is this post for?**

To be honest I dunno, supposed to be more like a detailed bio for people to read before messaging but I don't know what it became, I talk too much. :P - Just be friendly."

I am a huge fan of journaling in memoir form and have found it to be an incredibly valuable and insightful tool in my life. Looking back on entries is like going back in time and reading about an entirely different person.

So in light of how much joy this kind of introspection has brought me, I would hope to find a pen pal with whom I can exchange similarly intimate and honest letters, in which we document our lives. We could share our dreams and aspirations, our problems, our fears, and our past, and ask each other for advice should we ever need it. :) Of course, I would hope the correspondence also to be long-term. You can be from anywhere in the world, so long as you speak English somewhat fluently!

To give more concrete info about myself: I've been an artist for as long as I remember, and have recently become heavily interested in writing as well! I love going to the theatre with friends and watching films. So maybe we could also include movie recommendations in our letters. Beyond that, I'm a huuuuuuuge music lover. I love Mazzy Star, Jeff Buckley, Type O Negative, Michel Legrand, Alice in Chains and lots of other artists too. I am also interested in philosophy, astrology, and ethics.

Furthermore, I hope for a pen pal to be around my age, so 17‚Äì19 years old! It doesn't matter what gender you are or where you are from at all! E-mail and snail mail are both fine with me (although I reckon it will take a while for me to buy some new post stamps.) So should you be interested, DM me! Bonus points if you're queer, LOL!"

Afterwards I wrote the story of the game all down on a Google Doc and I forgot about it afterwards, until today, I remembered about it again, so I figured I'll share it here. Here is the doc:

  
(Coven All Any) Roll Veteran. Decide to not alert night 1, luckily it pays off and I survive. Mafioso and a PB left day 1, and those were the only deaths. Slow day 2, i try to vet bait by aggroing on the surv claim. They don‚Äôt get upped. N2 Jailed. Explain to Jailor I‚Äôm vet and my bait. I was attacked in jail. Vigi shot a silent mayor, unlucky. Day 3 is much the same, slow and I try to lynch surv but it doesn‚Äôt happen. 7 and 9 are psychic claims, kinda sus. N3 Finally time to alert. Turns out the surv claim was maf and I kill them, get destroyed. Maf is now out. A vamp also goes down, to a VH, 8, who‚Äôs now proven. Jester also got exed by jailor. Day 4 is again slow. Night 4 Alert again, and I kill a sheriff. 9‚Äôs GA, 6, also goes down, don‚Äôt remember how. Day and Night 5 go by with nothing happening, 14 is an invest who first claimed day 4 so they‚Äôre extremely sus, as well as the 2 psychics. Then it‚Äôs just me, the VH, and the jailor. 9‚Äôs GA protted them days 5 and 6 too, which was very annoying. Day 6 we finally get that invest claim lynched, somehow, they were real. Meanwhile earlier in the day, 9 tried to say they were the vet, and I shut that down immediately and post my will, pretty much confirming they‚Äôre a vamp. Night 6 I‚Äôm out of alerts, expecting to be bitten. I‚Äôm not. 8 the VH gets 7, one of the psys. Now just me, the VH, 11 (jailor) and 9 (obvious vamp). Both 9 and 11 start whispering me as I realise the jailor is now bit. I have the opportunity to hang 8 and wait for the vamps to bite me for an easy win. But I don‚Äôt. I refuse to vote, and cry for 8 to take them down. Wasn‚Äôt sure if they could bite this night. I wait out the night, and I‚Äôm still vet! And VH got the jailor turned vamp! **WE DID IT!!!!!** The hype is insane. We hang 9 the following day. The dude who tried to steal my claim, yeah, get out of here. Me and 8 did it. We did it for 1, the unlucky vigi who had stayed all game. I wasn‚Äôt gonna give in to the vamps. **We did it.**

The Reds vs Blacks 

Just to note this is a summary of events, battles will be glossed over and deaths mentioned briefly. I am not too skilled at wars or tactics in it and I would like help on the matter. I have already jotted down what I planned to happen but second thoughts are everything.

Also, all these houses are referenced from the AWOIAF Dance of the Dragons page so if it's missing some I guess you can offer up some or ignore it.

All in all, it is 51 houses (blacks) against 52 others (reds) that don't include the triarchy.  (I didn't plan it that way but I guess it works) As you can see the Crownlands, Reach and Riverlands are split between both factions

I‚Äôd like opinions on this part because I tried to keep things equal between each faction.

**Claim/Changes**

The Dance Begins 129-130 AC

Daemon thinks he has a greater claim than the Blacks because he is more fit for the position, with no legitimate hierarchy. He finds his allies with more traditional Lords who want to maintain order in their succession rights.

While those on the Blacks side believe in backing their promise and going against Daemon‚Äôs attempt to overthrow, they also try to integrate Essos culture into Westeros seeing that he is married to and has a son with Marra Rogare. All of these reasons are part of the seeds from which the Rebellion grows.

The Rebellion comes to be in 130 AC in the high morning of The King‚Äôs Funeral where Rhaenyra is crowned. 

Daemon later takes Dragonstone and declares himself King. He sends ravens to the Great Houses to follow his declaration.

Word comes back to King's Landing and the Blacks prepare their own banners. Aemond and Daeron are sent as envoys. The latter goes to The Riverlands, Reach and Westerlands while the other goes to The Stormlands, Vale and North.

Storm‚Äôs End. Baela is there when Aemond arrives and he tries to capture her? Kill her? (In this AU the Strong boys don‚Äôt exist and Baela is the one who took his eye) anyway the stress makes her go into labour too early and she has a stillborn.

Blood and Cheese happens. Instead of a son, it is Rhaenyra‚Äôs only daughter.

Though the Riverlands are at first unified they begin to break apart at the seams. Civil war breaks out between them different from the canon of them yielding to one faction its full-on bloodshed.

Giving up on trying to claim the Riverlands fully, Aemond is sent to finish his journey to the Vale and North.

The Reach begins its own in-house fighting but to a less extreme degree.

Criston and an army are sent out to stop it but are unsuccessful.

The year ends with the closing of the borders.

**All Out War - 131 AC**

Rhaenys decides to claim the Riverlands with her own dragon since the Blacks have no control over it. 

Distrust begins to grow between the Crownlands and many turn their cloaks in the name of the Reds.It starts to follow with the chaos and Criston turns his army towards Dunkensdale and Rook‚Äôs Rest but they refuse to surrender. 

The Battle of Rook‚Äôs Rest happens between Aegon, Helaena and Rhaenys. Aegon is burned the same as Canon and Rhaenys and Meleys die.

Once Aegon‚Äôs body comes back the Blacks have a council. Tyland wants to send his children to the Crownlands before things get too serious, Alicent also wants her other grandchildren to leave but Rhaenyra refuses and decides to send them to the Var. Lord Jason and the guy related to Viserea send ships to battle Daemons while Otto says they should gain an alliance with the triarchy.

Learning of this the Reds cut off trade to the Vale making them act in retaliation. Rhaenyra aids them with Daeron. All-out war at sea happens between the forces of the Vale, triarchy and other ships.

In the skies are Syrax and Terrassion vs Seasmoke

Rhaena dies in between the fighting, Aegon the younger/unworthy (Daemon‚Äôs son) is saved by a heavily injured Laenor and Seasmoke before being taken back to Dragonstone before they succumb to their injuries.

Syrax also passes and Rhaenyra is stuck in the Vale. (She is out for the remainder of the war since at this point she is with child.)

Before the Fall of King‚Äôs Landing, Larys takes Aegon out of the city by the decree of Alicent. He flees to Dragonstone while Daemon takes Nettles and the rest of his faction to claim the castle after it is left unattended with Alicent, Otto, Helaena and Tyland as hostages. He kills Otto, sends Alicent to the Black Cells and plans to torture Tyland to lift the treasury ban.

He also orders soldiers from the Crownlands to take on the army in the Reach. This and other factors lead to a rise in taxes and angers the smallfolk.

The Iron Isles attack the Westerlands with full force.

Daeron goes to help in the Reach with their own battles, facing Addam once he comes. He goes against Daeron and his dragon. Addams dies. Vermithor is injured and Terrassion is killed.

Aemond tries to convince Lord Stark to convince the Northerners to join the war officially. (by force probably)

This year ends with the winter setting in.

**The End of the War/ The Year Of Three Kings 132 AC**

The Red Kraken claims the Westerlands and half the Reach as his own + Dragonstone is compromised by Aegon and raiding has deprived it and Driftmark of funds.

Daemon begins to lose a following. Riots in Kings Landing call for him, Baela and her children to flee. Her youngest son, Joffrey takes the place of Maelor‚Äôs fate.

I had the idea of having the battle between Daemon and Aemond in the city of Kings Landing instead of God's eye. Mostly so that the Dragonpits would have a viable reason to be destroyed and all the dragons in it. This will probably destroy most of the city as well since the sheer size of both dragons.

In this way, the peasant's madness in revolting would turn against Daemon and kill him with their own hands. A sort of symbolizing way. The Prince of Fleabottom was killed by his own. Aemond has already died from being crushed underneath Vhagars body.

After Daemon‚Äôs death, Alyn takes the mantle of heir away from Aegon (Daemon‚Äôs son) and declares himself King. He begins to march his army towards King‚Äôs Landing.

I think that‚Äôs where I want the whole Gaemon plotline to step in. Claiming the boy as Daemon‚Äôs son and taking the city for themselves with the voice of his mother and the shepherd.

Obviously, Aegon burning Rhaenyra with dragon fire will be gone but the whole thing at Dragonstone will be stripped away entirely. Instead, Aegon learns of Daemon‚Äôs death, takes the blues hostage and plans to take King‚Äôs Landing with word of his survival. The rest of the Blue‚Äôs followers will have to stand down or face the deaths of the last of them.

Alyn takes it as a changes and heads towards Dragonstone of Silverwing. Aegon and Alyn fight (without dragons) and the latter is taken out by sword.

The war officially ends there with the army marching to retake King‚Äôs Landing.

There is still fighting afterwards but this is where the war ends for the throne.

**Removal**

Second point no dragonseeds (well at least not until the Red faction grows desperate)

Alyn Addam and Nettles are pretty dead-set to me in that regard. Even though Ulf White has been mentioned I have no role for him since technically he is not a dragonseed in this AU.

Hugh Hammer. I honestly just forgot about him.

I guess Trystan Truefyre doesn't exist

Otto is not removed as Hand 

Burning of the Riverland. I thought they suffered enough by their own hands and anything else would be extreme.

I split the injuries between Aegon and Laenor.
‚Äî

Also, I left out a lot of small details but this is the main gist I wanted to focus on. Please let me know anything I could fix or improve on, I‚Äôm not good at war tactics or other things. This fic is purely for fun but I want things to at least make sense.

I come to you all with an idea I have of how the Dance would go in my AU. I came here before to talk about potential suitors for Helaena.

basically, i know chishiya‚Äôs motives were selfish but i just don‚Äôt really know what his exact goals were or what he was trying to avoid. why did he betray arisu and why do kuina and him want the cards for themselves? i‚Äôm especially confused because at the end of season 1 arisu doesn‚Äôt even seem to hold it against chishiya anymore, even though he could‚Äôve died. i hope my question(s) make sense lol"

Looking for this novel,romancenovels,1i9htla,2025-01-25 02:30:05,6,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1i9htla/looking_for_this_novel/,Plastic-Guitar7016,‚ùì Question ‚ùì ,"My body was discovered in an abandoned building.

The construction worker vomited as he dialed emergency services.

Mark rushed from Emma's kidney treatment to the crime scene.

The forensic expert frowned, gesturing for them to put on masks.

My husband Mark was the city's most renowned detective. He'd solved countless murder cases, yet even he faltered when he saw this corpse.

The summer heat had done its work. The body was bloated, the face beaten beyond recognition - a mass of flesh and blood where features should have been.

The injuries were extensive. The head barely hung onto the neck by a strip of skin.

The stench of decomposition filled the air.

Mark closed his eyes briefly, took a deep breath, and pulled on his gloves to begin the preliminary examination.

I watched nervously as he removed the blood-stained necklace from my neck.

Two rings hung from the chain - our wedding rings that I had handcrafted for us with love.

I remembered how proud I'd been, presenting them to Mark. Days spent carefully making them perfect.

But when Emma saw him wearing his, she had laughed cruelly. ""What is that ugly thing? Did you fish it out of a dumpster?""

Mark had ripped off the ring immediately, throwing it back at me. His face had burned with humiliation.

""You're my wife,"" he had snapped. ""You're supposed to help me succeed, not make me look ridiculous in front of others.""

Though his cold words still echoed in my ears, I believed surely he would recognize these rings now.

These symbols of our marriage, of my love for him.

But Mark just impassively instructed his assistant to bag them as evidence.

His colleague worked methodically, then suddenly paused. ""Mark... the victim was pregnant. About two months along.""

I watched, heart breaking, as Mark's expression darkened with rage.

""These animals!"" he snarled, slamming his hand against the wall. ""How could they be so cruel to a pregnant woman?""

I wanted to scream. To shake him.

Emma was diagnosed with kidney failure just five days ago. The doctors said she needed a transplant urgently.

Mark had rushed to the hospital at midnight. On the way, he begged me.

""You have to help her, Alice. You're a match. You're the only match they've found.""

""I'm pregnant, Mark. Two months. That's why I can't donate my kidney to Emma. Please understand.""

His response had been instant and cruel: ""Another lie? First you refuse to help Emma, now you make up a pregnancy? How low will you sink?""

He abandoned me on the highway and then I was kidnapped.

Now he stood over my body, burning with righteous anger for an unknown victim.

But he refused to believe his own wife's pregnancy.

He just instructed his assistant to note it down as just another detail in the case file. ""Make sure to highlight the pregnancy in the report. This makes the case high priority.""

I shouldn't have hoped. I never existed in Mark's heart. He never believed me, never trusted me, not since the day we married.

In Mark's heart, every word I spoke was a lie, every action suspicious. He saved his trust and love for Emma.

Even though I was his wife. Even though I had loved him with everything I had.

My friend Sarah had warned me from the start. ""Mark only married you because he couldn't be with Emma, Emma will always be his true love.""

I hadn't believed her then. I'd thought our love was real, that time would prove her wrong.

But after marriage, the truth became impossible to ignore.

I realized I had no place in his heart. Every room in our house held photos of him and Emma from their past. Every story he told somehow included her name.

I was just an intruder in their love story. A placeholder until Emma could return to her rightful place.

Taking off his gloves, his colleague rubbed his furrowed brow: ""Victim appears to be around 25 years old. Preliminary cause of death is throat cutting. Shows signs of prolonged torture before death.""

""The method is extremely cruel. This will cause public outrage. We need to solve this before it explodes in the media."" Mark lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag, seemingly troubled.

Even in death, I was causing him problems.

The forensic expert warned: ""The killer's still out there. Tell your loved ones to be careful. Don't let Emma go out alone at night.""

Mark irritably replied: ""Emma always listens to me. It's my wife, Alice, I can't control.""

The forensic expert was an old friend and knew their situation well.

Mark absently rubbed his stomach.

The forensic expert noticed Mark wincing. ""Your stomach acting up again?""

Mark waved it off. ""It's fine. Alice bought me some medicine and kept it at home.""

He trailed off, suddenly silent.

His supposedly defiant wife had always cared deeply about his health.

The expert patted Mark's back: ""Be kinder to your wife. She's the one who chose to marry you.""

Mark shook his head: ""The other day, Emma was diagnosed with kidney failure. Alice even refused to donate a kidney to Emma, making up lies about being two months pregnant.""

The expert hesitated. ""Mark... maybe she really is pregnant?""

""Impossible!"" Mark snapped. ""I haven't touched her in over two months.""

""But remember that night two months ago? When you got completely drunk at the bar...""

Mark cut him off. ""Emma stayed with me that night. She told me Alice never showed up.""

My soul ached hearing those words.

The person who had stayed by your side that night was me.

I had held your hand while you were sick.

I had wiped your face with a cool towel.

I had watched over you until dawn broke.

But Emma had twisted everything, convincing you I'd abandoned you that night.

""She hasn't been home for days. Who knows what trouble she's getting into. I should never have married her."" Mark continued.

Hearing Mark's accusations and complaints about me, my heart turned to ice.

Mark, it's not that I didn't want to come home.

I just... can't come home anymore.

Your defiant wife died the day you chose to accompany Emma to her treatment.

My body lies right before your eyes, carrying the child you refuse to believe existed."

Am I the only one bothered by the declining morals of this show?,TheWayHomeHallmark,1i9gamy,2025-01-25 00:44:15,0,0.25,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1i9gamy/am_i_the_only_one_bothered_by_the_declining/,Red84604,,"I've seen some interviews with the cast where they really focus on how un-Hallmark-like this show is, and how proud of it they all are--specifically that it is so ""dark."" But I don't think it's a good thing. 

This is a show that my whole family watches together. Some weeks it is the only time we get to spend with my 17 year old step-daughter. (She is exactly Alice's age, so each season has resonated in a different way.) She's so busy with all of her teenage stuff, but she still makes time to watch this show, I think because the mother/daughter struggle is so cathartic to watch. 

But now we have Kat and Elliot starting foreplay on the kitchen island? What am I supposed to do with that as a mom watching with her kids?

We've got Kat and Elliot shacking up, with Jacob joking about how only someone from 200 years ago could possibly object. We've got Del lying on top of Sam and Jacob getting drunk. No comment on the thing that we're not allowed to comment on in this thread. Now they're getting deeper into Tarot cards? Seriously?

This started out as a beautiful show about inter-generational family bonding. And now they are subtly social engineering every progressive cause out there. I'm not sure at what point I say enough is enough and shut it off, but this season is getting VEEEERY close for me.  "

Dirt, Jar of Flies, Self Titled and Facelift are all among some of the best albums of all time in my opinion. Another one would be the rapper Big L which he only released one album before his super early death. If he hadn't of been killed he definitely would've gone down as one of the greatest rappers of all time easily.

Introducing Jolii AI - Best app for language learning with netflix,ProRecs,1i9di3l,2025-01-24 22:01:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRecs/comments/1i9di3l/introducing_jolii_ai_best_app_for_language/,AnissaSchaffer,language learning,"[Learning Languages While Watching Netflix](https://language-learning-with-netflix.com/)? Here's My Experience!





I have recently found something that‚Äôs completely changed the way I learned a new language. Its name is Jolii AI. 



Before the amazement, I was stuck with conventional language apps and boring exercises. But Jolii has changed my learning experience a lot. 



So, here‚Äôs the deal. I am an accute binge-watcher. I‚Äôd prefer to sit down and crush a series in a weekend rather than going out. But I also wanted to stay productive with my time. 



That‚Äôs when I started to browsed around the language learning apps. And I wondered if I can learn new language directly from Netflix. Then I found my new pal: Jolii AI. 



What makes it different? 



Imagine watching your favorite TV shows while learning new language in more fun way. That‚Äôs exactly what Jolii AI offers. The app can integrate with Netflix and turn your favorite TV shows into language course. 



Here‚Äôs how it works



Subtitles: With Netflix + Jolii AI, you can pause, replay, and click specific words in the show to see its translations, meaning, and practices in real-time. 

Vocabulary tracker: Through the app, you can save new words or phrases that you can review later. Since it is your account, you can have your own personalized dictionary. 

Quizzes: There are fun and engaging little quizzes to test what you‚Äôve got from the series. So, it doesn‚Äôt feel like studying. 



The best part? You can import your favorite Netflix show. For me, that means watching Alice in Borderland while picking up some Japanese slang. 



More than Just Netflix



Not only Netflix, Jolii AI can also work with Youtube, movies, and music platform. I made a contact with its customer support and asked for an insider information. They have been working on their platform and expecting  more platforms integration in the future. 



Why Jolii Over Other Apps?



I am not a newbie in language learning world. I‚Äôve tried a lot of apps like Duolingo, Babbel, you name it. But I can‚Äôt find anything like Jolii which is more personalized.



I‚Äôve been around with common apps that only offer generic lessons. But Jolii AI is tailored to the learner. The AI even tracks your progress and suggest the best content based on preferences. 

The app also has built-In chatbots that you can use to practice speaking. The chatbot is so sophisticated. It was like talking to real person rather than a bot! I‚Äôm serious! 



The Drawbacks



Nothing is perfect. I agree with that. But the only downside I‚Äôve found so far is the fact that it is a paid app. However, there‚Äôs a free trial that you can use before committing to paid membership. 



Would I Recommend it? 



Absolutely. Jolii has everything I need, and probably to you too. It‚Äôs been accompanying me for few weeks. And I have zero complain about this app. 

 

I can learn new language without having to attend a boring class. Even better! I can choose what to watch and what to learn. 



So, has anyone else tried [Jolii.ai](https://www.jolii.ai/) or similar apps? Or, do you have any alternatives to share?

My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, Frank Iero and the Future Violets (and Patience and cellabration), Linkin Park, Mike Shinoda, Fort Minor, Dead by Sunrise, Grey Daze, Marilyn Manson, PVRIS, Deftones, 311, Paramore, Hayley Williams, Halestorm, Shinedown, Chvrches, David Bowie, Tin Machine, The Beatles, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Twenty One Pilots, I Don't Know How But They Found Me, Panic! At the Disco (only the beginning), Fall Out Boy, Set It Off, The Misfits, Crosses, The Neighbourhood, The 1975 (only their early stuff), In This Moment, The Rolling Stones, Now, Now (I also liked them when they were known as Now, Now Every Children), Tancred (Jess Abbott), The Kinks, The Hollies, Alice Cooper, Tonight Alive, Dead Sara, Nine Inch Nails, Team Sleep, Metallica, Purity Ring, Van Halen, Dio (Ronnie James Dio), Judas Priest, Avenged Sevenfold, Love, Robot; Heirsound

I‚Äôm a 20yo bisexual male who started reading Heartstopper earlier this week, I knew it existed for a few years but never got round to reading it, until I got a notification that a new page was added on WebToon, so I thought fuck it and started reading, and then kept reading, and kept reading until the afternoon of the following day I had read all of it, and I think it was that scene at Harry‚Äôs party that made me keep going, because I saw myself in Nick and that feeling just grew stronger and stronger the more I read. 

We‚Äôre both semi-traditionally masculine, dress similar, played rugby (very masculine sport), yet there‚Äôs layers to both of us, the only difference between us is he had Charlie and could be so emotionally vulnerable to, were I still don‚Äôt feel‚Ä¶(‚Äùsafe‚Äù is the wrong word but I‚Äôll use it as a placeholder) that I can be vulnerable to another person. I hid in a cubicle at work quietly crying when I got my results back from a maths exam earlier this year fearing I might not pass the module, I have moments where I feel like no one really understands me/sees me properly and not a false image I‚Äôve built for myself and I can‚Äôt help but buckle under all my feelings.

It‚Äôs 2am and I‚Äôm crying as I write this but I needed somewhere to vent and to write my thoughts out, I finally get why so many people love this comic/tv series, I just wish I joined sooner, now that the end is in sight. If you‚Äôve made it this far thank you. It‚Äôs only been a couple days since I caught up with the series, but I think my life is going to change for the better now because of it.

Thank you Alice Oseman"

humor is much appreciated, as well as well written/emotionally nuanced characters, and *~tension~*. to note, i am not into sort of dubcon! 

if it helps, authors i've enjoyed in the past include meredith duran, alice coldbreath, and elisa braden. outside of hisrom: lois mcmaster bujold, grace draven, and brandon sanderson. 

i've been on quite the dnf streak and i'm hoping plots with twisty turns and giggles will help.

Tldr are the earlier games worth getting? I started with fatal bullet on the switch and have absolutely loved it. Working on getting all the endings. I see that there is Sao hollow fragment (which id have to buy on pc), then there was sao lost song (which again I'd have to buy on pc) and then sao hollow realization (which id be able to get on my switch). I seem to be getting mixed results when I look at reviews. I don't mind bad graphics (I'm use to playing osrs which is 2007 graphics) but I do really like open world or pseudo open world. I'd call fatal bullet pseudo open world. I do plan to play alicization lycorice , last recollection and fractured daydream. I'm just wondering if its worth going back for the earlier ones? Especially cause lost song and hollow fragment are only around 20 buck each.

Someone recommended me another book titled ""The Tao of Fully Feeling"" by Pete Walker a while back. That book was extremely helpful, but regardless, I am in need of more talismans and tomes of knowledge in times like these, obviously. The more the merrier.**

**-------------------**

Does anyone know of a book (or books) that strongly debunks, refutes, and outright spurns any form of (child) abuse (physical, emotional, mental, verbal, spiritual, the WHOLE package). INCLUDING the more covert/hidden/clandestine forms of abuse.

By covert/hidden, I mean the classic BS of things like: ***""It was 'just' slapping,"" ""legal with an open palm,"" ""I was only teasing you, can't you take a joke,"" ""why can't you see that that was then, and this is now,"" ""that spanking was nothing compared to how families would beat and kill their kids,"" ""I never hit you, so I'm not in the wrong,"" ""I didn't hit you that much, so I'm not in the wrong,"" ""I could've starved you and threw hot water on you but I didn't,"" ""I could've called you ugly and worthless every day but I didn't, it was just harmless teasing, can't you take a joke,"" ""I provided healthcare and aid for you when you were physically sick/injured, so it doesn't matter/isn't serious that I ignored you and dismissed you when you told me about your mental (more intangible, basically)/neurological issues/illnesses and left that neglected and undiagnosed for years,"" ""I only hit him/beat him/slapped him/yelled at him because he was being annoying and bratty, I couldn't take it anymore, at least I didn't throw him out the window or leave a mark/make him bleed,"" ""I let my child bully and torment my other child (their sibling) for years on end, but it's just them having fun, it's just 'sibling rivalry,' plus everything is okay now (even though no proper or actual apologies/amends were ever made), surely it couldn't have left a mark, plus both children were kinda bratty,"" ""I said very hurtful things to my kid sometimes growing up and never/rarely apologized, but I never hit them, plus I sometimes said nice things to them sometimes, so I'm not the one in the wrong (even though the inconsistency/flip-flopping of hurtful and nice comments puts the kid in a state of confusion/self-gaslighting).***

Why am I being so demanding? Because too many books about dysfunctional/narcissistic/emotionally immature/toxic parents always talk about the more extreme cases of childhood abuse and neglect, as well as the more textbook narcissistic/abusive parents. **You know, the parents who would abuse their kids on a scale where it was basically like how Amon Goeth abused Helen Hirsch, whereas the kids are somehow perfect little angels who somehow were magically mentally like adults once they were out of the womb, fit the mold of the ""perfect victim"" fallacy, either they screwed up in ""mild"" ways and their parents abused them in turn, or their parents abused them because they were Amon Goeth-level villains who abused only ""for the evulz"" (aka abusing their kids just for the fun/sake of doing so).** 

**Even the covert/vulnerable (non-stereotypical) narcissist parent and characteristics of such are more often than not are presented in a more textbook/classic manner in these sorts of books (e.g. their ""woe is me"" complex is on the higher end of the spectrum/blown out of proportion, etc)**

And TOO many ignorant people out there (incompetent psychologists/mental health counselors included) think that kids need to fit the ""picture-perfect victim"" in order to be a ""proper"" victim (e.g. never/seldom rebelling, never/seldom talking back, never/seldom throwing tantrums, never/seldom being bratty, never/seldom being rude/inappropriate, never/seldom doing things that kids and adolescents normally do). And if the child turns out to be ""a bad egg,"" it's somehow entirely their fault **(e.g. there's this mythical legend of a monster named El Silbon, who when he was alive was once a little boy who was excessively pampered his own parents who couldn't say no to him, and resulting from that the boy became incredibly spoiled. It got to a point where he one day murdered his own father because he failed to find and hunt desired food for him. His grandfather, who also lived with the family, responded to this by tying his grandson to a tree and whipping his back until it was raw and bloody, rubbing hot condiments into the wounds to make them sting, throwing a sack with the dad's dead body on the boy's back, and sending the dog to run after the boy and devour him once said dog caught up to him. It's an old legend, I know, but all the blame is heaped on the boy...it was never considered that maybe...it was the parent's fault for spoiling him to this point).**

Moreover, if kids/adolescents ""act out"" to a more severe point (profanity, drinking, partying, sneaking out, ditching class, smoking, getting with the ""wrong crowd"") it's more often than not as a result of external circumstances. **\[e.g. if you read the novel ""Twisted"" by Laurie Halse Anderson, the protagonist, a high-schooler/senior named Tyler Miller, is pretty much a delinquent (he cuts class, drinks, sneaks out to a party, disrespects authority, steals, vandalizes, and gets into/causes lots of legal trouble) but even though it's clearly portrayed as unjustified for Tyler to take out/lash out his struggles on his best friend, it's pretty much confirmed that the constant emotional abuse/emotional neglect of his workaholic/emotionally distant/angry father, overall enabling of such from the mother, history of severe bullying, subtle enforcement of toxic masculinity from his father, dysfunctional school environment, ostracizing, incompetent authority figures, and the father's lack of emotional maturity to adequately address and deal with Tyler's problems were all the main reasons why Tyler turned out the way he did in the first place. And it's blatantly conveyed and even SAID near/at end of the book that even though Tyler's father ""had it worse as a kid,"" suffered trans-generational trauma/childhood abuse himself, provided for Tyler the bare minimum, as well as surprisingly NEVER hit him, that's not an excuse for mistreating/neglecting Tyler emotionally and verbally all these years).**

And trying to throw out the lame argument ""But what if a kid abuses their parents?!?!?!"" is just the same as some incels trying to spout ""BuT iF tHe GeNdErS aRe ReVeRsEd"" and ""sOcIeTy PrOtEcT wOmEn ToO mUcH"" to covertly boost/back up their misogyny. Here's the analogy: parents who are truly shivering in fear of their children coming to maltreat them, and not the other way around?They're rare. And very much so. And back to comparison: It's extremely hard for a man abused by a woman to come forth and seek justice/healing/tell the truth, but that doesn't mean it's any easier for a woman abused by a man to do so as well. It's why stupid phrases like ""What were you wearing?"" ""Boys will be boys,"" and ""He's only bullying you because he likes you,"" exists. It's why so many male rapists and domestic abusers legally walk free and manage to keep continue abusing and perhaps even assault or kill their female victims. Not to mention there's a historical power imbalance between the two genders: in practically almost all cultures and religions throughout history, patriarchy and male supremacy was the mindset. And even as it faded with time, it has never truly vanished, and still plays a big role in society today. For parents and their kids, there's not only a historic, but also BIOLOGICAL, power imbalance. Kids are born as blank slates and easily influenced. Little kids are not physically strong. And even adolescents don't have fully developed brains and can be easily influenced/manipulated. **I know ALL of this, and I keep telling myself this/things like this, but more often than not in my current familial situation and with my covert narc/emotionally immature/enabler egg donor angrily blowing up at me and yelling emotionally manipulative lectures/dangerous beliefs at me, I often start self-gaslighting and self-doubt/blame starts creeping in, regarding my upbringing. Nasty thoughts start creeping in, thoughts like ""you deserved to be hit, because you did/acted like \[this or that\]"" or ""it wasn't 'that bad,' you weren't starved or homeless or left bleeding, no one was an alcoholic or drug-addict."" And that is why I am in need of more book(s) befitting all of the requests/descriptions/guidelines/details in this post.**

Additionally, a while back I discovered a book titled ""For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence"" by Alice Miller. This book described, contained, and debunked most if not all of the things/examples I put above, and it was validating, but I was quite discouraged when I found out that Alice Miller herself was ironically abusive/neglectful to her own children.

Also, if you're going to recommend a book that befits all my requests above, I request/beseech a few last things: make sure the book is on some degree popular, renowned, and is backed-up/supported with solid/unshakable evidence and facts. There are COUNTLESS self-help books out there that are less-known, and in the sea of all these books some information could be inaccurate/dangerous (e.g. the BS ""You need to forgive and forget in order to move on,"" ""You would want to hit your kids too sometimes,"" ""all parents say derogatory things to their kids""). Heck, even some of the more well-known books have inaccurate/dangerous info/advice. Finally, please make sure the author/creator isn't controversial. I was SO disappointed, shocked, and baffled when I found out that Alice Miller, having written so many revolutionary books that spoke up/informed the world of child abuse, was herself abusive to her own kin.

WIBTA if I put a sign on my bathroom door asking to knock before entering?,dustythunder,1i961b0,2025-01-24 16:07:35,50,0.95,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1i961b0/wibta_if_i_put_a_sign_on_my_bathroom_door_asking/,Top-Grab-7660,,"This is a bit of a long post since I think it requires a bit of background explanation to get where I'm coming from here, so if you get through the whole thing, I really appreciate it. TLDR at the bottom. 

I know this sounds passive aggressive, which is why I‚Äôm asking here because I‚Äôve got somewhat of an odd situation. I (26M) have two roommates, Alice (26F) and Bob (26M). Alice has been my best friend since high school and I met Bob in undergrad. Bob and I have been generally friendly, but don't really enjoy spending time with him.

Alice and I have had several issues with Bob since moving into our place a little over 3 years ago. I'll try and keep it short, but in general the issues have come down to multiple smaller, careless things that bob does that rub us the wrong way. In a few words, Bob has never been malicious, but he is perhaps the most clueless person that either Alice or I have ever met. He's forgotten to shut the oven off overnight, he'll leave trash and unfinished drinks and food in the common areas occasionally, leaves lights on in rooms he's not in, things of that nature. Last week, a few minutes after Alice had finished cooking he almost burned his hand on the stove, not noticing the ""hot surface"" indicator light. He just does not seem to be very conscious of his surroundings. 

Alice and I also have a theory (shared among mutual friends of ours and Bob's) that Bob has undiagnosed, high-functioning autism. I hope that this post does not mean to imply that I have anything against Autistic people, I truly don't, and I have other Autistic friends that I've shared this with who think Bob may be autistic as well. We think this for a number of reasons:

* Growing up, Bob was almost entirely nonverbal until the age of 5.
* He comes from the kind of family that would not seek out or take seriously a clinical Autism diagnosis.
* It seems difficult for him to pick up on social cues (more on this further down).
* When we have had roommate meetings to resolve conflict, Bob has on multiple occasions seemed to  completely miss *why* Alice and I shared the things about his behavior that frustrated us. 
* The way in which Bob communicates with most people, including us, would be best described as the tone of voice one takes when having a chat with a coworker you don't know very well around the fax machine. He's extremely friendly-sounding, to the point that it almost seems fake. I'm not an expert, but from what I've read and been told by my Autistic friends, it seems like an extreme masking behavior.
* During a previous roommate meeting, we had agreed as a group to talk in person or send messages in our group chat if there was something we needed to communicate or had a question about, (for example, something like ""where are the trash bags?""). Despite this, Bob continues to communicate questions or comments of this nature via sticky notes or notes written on our chore chart whiteboard. Alice and I continue to be baffled. 
* Our conflict came to a head about a year ago when Alice and I sat down with Bob and told him that we had another friend who was interested in taking his room. (Our lease is month to month). We told him that it seemed like as a group, we had difficulties communicating despite things like the roommate meeting and chore chart. We said our friend was interested in moving, and the dates were flexible, with the earliest move-in date being 60 days after the meeting, and longer if Bob needed more time finding a place. We offered him the entirety of his security deposit back and help finding a new apartment and moving his things (Alice and I both own cars, Bob does not and usually takes an uber or is driven by his girlfriend). Bob was not a fan of this idea and let us know that he thought if we communicated better, we could stay together and that he did not want to leave. Alice and I were taken aback upon hearing this, we thought that what we were doing up until that point *was* communicating as best we could but Bob's name is on the lease along with ours, so there wasn't much we could do at that point. After the meeting, Bob more or less moved into his girlfriend's house, only coming home once every two or three months to pick up or drop off some belongings. He continued to pay rent and utilities throughout, and Alice and I were baffled.

Anyway, that's the background of the whole situation. Onto today's conflict: 

Around two weeks ago, Bob shows up out of the blue and starts staying in his room again like he'd never been away. So now he's back, and I suppose that's that. Today's conflict happened this morning. Our apartment has two bathrooms. One is closer to my bedroom and is directly accessible from the hallway, so visitors usually use that one. The other is located between Bob and Alice's rooms and is not directly accessible from the common area, but has doors to both Bob's room and Alice's room. I'm in my bathroom, getting ready to take a shower. Fully nude, on the toilet, doing my business before I step in. The door is shut, the fan is on, and the lights are on. I don't lock the bathroom door when I'm in there since our cats' litter box is also in my bathroom, so it's possible for them to slide open the door and use the litter box if I'm in the shower, I don't mind. I see the door start to slide open and don't immediately react, assuming it's one of our cats, but after half a second, I realize that it's Bob. I get up, saying ""whoa, whoa whoa!"" and Bob shuts the door, saying, ""Sorry! I didn't process it!"" and I'm left shaken, naked, and frankly a little pissed off. 

Mostly it's because there was every sign (except a locked door) that indicated that there was someone in the bathroom (light on, fan on, door shut) and Bob did not pick up on any of those, nor did he knock before coming in. Alice had already left the house at that point, so I know for a fact that the other bathroom was completely free, so why he felt compelled to come down the hall into the other bathroom is beyond me. 

Anyway, my question is, WIBTA if I put a sign on my bathroom door that says ""Please knock when closed""? I feel like most people would interpret this as a passive aggressive slight, but I also feel like most people, when confronted with a closed door, the whirr of the fan, and the light coming out (the doors in our apartment have large frosted glass panels in them, so it's completely obvious to the outside if a light is on behind a closed door) would understand those things as indicators that the bathroom is occupied, so I'm at a bit of a loss. Should I wait and see if it happens again and then put the sign up? I also considered putting a message in our group chat, but that also seems remarkably condescending since we're all grown adults. Alice and I have had the same apprehension when trying to communicate with Bob about other things like this, where he's been careless or unaware of something, but it's something so obvious to us that we felt that bringing it up would be insulting to his intelligence. 

Any advice y'all have would be really appreciated, either about the sign on the bathroom door, or the situation in general. 

TLDR: My potentially undiagnosed Autistic roommate walked in on me naked in the bathroom before my shower, despite the door being shut, the fan being on, and light coming through the glass in the door. I don't know how to ask him to knock before entering without it coming across as condescending. "

"Should the president be allowed to pardon people who did dangerous things, like attacking the Capitol on January 6, or should there be rules to stop them from getting away with it?",1461daysoftrump,1i94xsc,2025-01-24 15:20:17,0,0.5,0,https://www.facebook.com/share/1BJgeWVibg/?mibextid=WC7FNe,KingDorkFTC,,"Heather Cox Richardson

January 23, 2025 (Thursday)

Last night, in an interview with host Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump tried to explain away his blanket pardons for the January 6 rioters, calling the instances of violence against police officers ‚Äúvery minor incidents.‚Äù 

In fact, as Brett Samuels of The Hill reported, about 600 of the rioters were accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding police officers, and ten were convicted of sedition. 

Ryan J. Reilly of NBC News explained that rioters wounded more than 140 officers with ‚Äúfirearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô billboard, ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device.‚Äù

Three federal judges have weighed in on the pardons after Trump‚Äôs appointees in the Department of Justice ordered them to dismiss pending cases against current January 6 defendants, an order that, as David Kurtz of Talking Points Memo noted, ‚Äúflies in the face of decades of DOJ independence.‚Äù 

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly summed up the judges‚Äô outrage when she wrote: ‚ÄúDismissal of charges, pardons after convictions, and commutations of sentences will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021. What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions analyzing and recounting the evidence through a neutral lens. Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.‚Äù 

The leaders of two key paramilitary gangs who participated in the January 6 violence, Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys and Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers, are not helping Trump to put the pardons behind him. Now out of prison rather than serving his 22-year sentence, Tarrio called in to conspiracy-theorist Alex Jones‚Äôs Infowars within hours of his release to claim that he still commands the gang and that he plans retribution for those who put him behind bars. Tess Owen of WIRED reported that the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors online activity, saw a surge among Proud Boys‚Äô channels after the pardons, as members discussed ways to advance Trump‚Äôs agenda.

Rhodes, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison, also wants revenge. On Wednesday, he was at the U.S. Capitol, where Michael Kunzelman and Lisa Mascaro of the Associated Press reported he met with at least one lawmaker and chatted with others. 

Politico‚Äôs Charlie Mahtesian reported tonight that those January 6 rioters Trump pardoned are already talking about running for office. Mahtesian notes that in primaries where candidates need to prove they are truly MAGA, those who served time in prison for Trump will have sterling credentials. 

Kunzelman and Mascaro also noted that, in an apparent attempt to divert attention from the pardons back to Trump‚Äôs contention that the bipartisan January 6 committee had been biased against him, on the same day that Rhodes was at the Capitol, House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) revived a special committee to retrace the steps of the House committee that investigated the riot. 

But that didn‚Äôt go terribly well, as Jacqueline Alemany of the Washington Post today reported an exclusive story revealing that last June an aide to Johnson advised the committee not to subpoena White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson out of concern that if it did, the sexually explicit texts Republican lawmakers had sent her might come to light. According to Alemany, ‚Äúmultiple colleagues had raised concerns with the speaker‚Äôs office about the potential for public disclosure of ‚Äòsexual texts from members who were trying to engage in sexual favors‚Äô with Hutchinson.‚Äù Instead, the committee accused former representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) of talking to Hutchinson without Hutchinson‚Äôs lawyer present. Cheney called the report ‚Äúdefamatory‚Äù and a ‚Äúmalicious and cowardly assault on the truth.‚Äù

Apparently undaunted, Trump today issued pardons for nearly two dozen antiabortion activists convicted of violating the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act, which the civil rights division of the Department of Justice explains ‚Äúprohibits threats of force, obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive health care services.‚Äù Trump, who is due to speak tomorrow by video with the annual antiabortion March for Life, said it was a ‚Äúgreat honor‚Äù to pardon the protesters. 

Still, Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico reported that one antiabortion activist, who wanted to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation from the administration, wondered why Trump hadn‚Äôt pardoned the antiabortion activists on Monday, as he did the January 6 rioters. ‚ÄúThese pardons are fully in line with Trump‚Äôs agenda to oppose the weaponization of the government,‚Äù she told Ollstein. ‚ÄúSo why he couldn‚Äôt have pardoned them along with the 1,500 on Day 1 is beyond me.‚Äù

It seems that for Trump and his extremist supporters, the federal government‚Äîwhich reflects the will of the majority‚Äîhas been ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù against a political minority that seeks to control the country. 

To gain that control, Trump has assured his followers that the country is literally under attack and that the United States, which has the strongest military and the strongest economy in the world, is losing. On Monday, Trump‚Äîwho persuaded congressional Republicans to kill a strong bipartisan measure to tighten the border and fund immigration courts so asylum-seekers could have quick hearings‚Äîdeclared that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, although border crossings are lower now than they were at the end of his first administration. The order asked the heads of the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security to consider whether it was necessary to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military to suppress domestic insurrection. 

Yesterday, acting secretary of defense Robert Salesses told reporters that the Department of Defense has ordered 1,500 active-duty military personnel along with air support and intelligence assets to the southern border of the United States, joining 2,500 active-duty military personnel already there, and that the military will provide flights for deportations led by the Department of Homeland Security. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump is directing ‚Äúthe Department of Defense to make homeland security a core mission of the agency.‚Äù

Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart of Reuters report that there have been informal discussions in the department about sending as many as 10,000 troops to the border, a discussion that raises the question of whether Mexico would feel obliged to respond in kind. And, according to Meg Kelly, Alex Horton, and Missy Ryan of the Washington Post, the Trump administration is trying to get rid of an office in the Pentagon that works to protect civilians in battlefield operations. The Civilian Protection Center of Excellence is housed within the Department of the Army and works to help the military limit unintended civilian deaths. 

And yet the idea of using a strong military to defend America apparently does not extend to its leadership. Tara Copp of the Associated Press reported that Trump‚Äôs nominee for defense secretary, Fox News Channel weekend host Pete Hegseth, who has a history of financial mismanagement, alcohol abuse, and allegations of sexual assault, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he paid a woman $50,000 as part of a confidentiality agreement to maintain her silence after she accused him of sexual assault. 

Today, both Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) said they could not support Hegseth‚Äôs nomination. They were the only two Republicans who refused to vote in favor of his nomination advancing to the full Senate today.

But they are not the only ones standing against Trump‚Äôs attempt to overturn traditional American values. 

Today, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour issued a temporary restraining order to block Trump‚Äôs executive order that sought to end the birthright citizenship established in 1868 by the Fourteenth Amendment. Twenty-two states and two cities, as well as other parties, have sued over the executive order. Coughenour was responding to a suit brought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. 

Coughenour, who was appointed to the bench by Republican president Ronald Reagan in 1981, told Trump‚Äôs Department of Justice attorneys, ‚ÄúI have been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as it is here. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order."" When the lawyers told him they maintained the order was constitutional, Coughenour was aghast. ""I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind. Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?""

Coughenour blocked the order until February 6, when he will hold a hearing to consider a preliminary injunction. 

And after Trump announced he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg yesterday announced that his philanthropic foundation will cover the financial contribution the U.S. will not. According to Zack Budryk of The Hill, it will also provide the agreement‚Äôs reporting requirements for emissions associated with climate change. 

‚Äú[P]hilanthropy‚Äôs role in driving local, state, and private sector action is more crucial than ever‚Äîand we‚Äôre committed to leading the way,‚Äù Bloomberg said.

Finally, tonight, firefighters have begun to control the fires in Southern California. As of this evening, the Hughes fire is 36% contained, the Laguna fire is no longer expanding, the Palisades fire is 75% contained, and the Eaton fire is 95% contained. New fires have broken out, but rain is forecast for the weekend."

I am getting terrible scores, right now I can barely get 10 million on brutal per key. I want to be able to get final chest at least on NM if not UNM. I don't have alot of the recommended champs, I don't even have Coldheart, so I'm wanting to make the best team with who I do have. I am including pics of my current champs, the teams that Hell Hades recommends (that's based on older upload, can't upload Alice or Visix for example) and also the team that is getting me the best score right now.

I would love some advice on which 2 next champs that I have should focus on to get to 6* to get the best score I can, or are the Hell Hades recommendations right?Thanks!! 

Oh, also, I really don't have any books to use on anyone, so that probably makes a difference. I have 1 each of legendary and epic only. I do have some rares."
Hastur's 6th Year Letter?,IdentityV,1i93to1,2025-01-24 14:32:39,8,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityV/comments/1i93to1/hasturs_6th_year_letter/,Quoth143,Question,"Has anybody unlocked Hastur's 6th character day letter yet?? I'm unable to read it atm (lack of coins plus this is my second year). The wiki hasn't updated yet too.

Also if anyone unlocked Helena's, would you be willing to share?

EDIT: The wiki updated with Hastur's and it's actually rather juicy when you think about it!

Alice has so far proven herself to have a neutral/skeptical perspective on the many manor guests (but very respectful mind you) and that neutrality has allowed for us to see that no, it's probably not just drug hallucinations. If anything, the drugs unlocked those memories in Arthur Byers who we have suspected as being an avatar for Hastur. 

Gonna say it now, called it. 

I called it on the drugs opening the doorway for supernatural elements.
