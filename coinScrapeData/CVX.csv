I just want to let everyone know that Optim Finance and Splash Protocol are about to implement a same like blueprint just like Curve DAO and Convex Finance from Ethereum!

Once ve Splash is a go, Optim finance their ODAO has the most voting power! So the most rewards wil go to Optim pools!

Whats even more bullish, is that all memecoin creators on Snek.Fun, gat a 0,05% ve Splash reward tokens so they can vote about where the generated fees go to which liquidity providing pools!

Also, if you check the Optim Finance X account, you can see they allready generated 100k fees! This is massive imo. Oh, and btw, the AI agent Talos, generated 3000k ADA alone on Splash Protocol

Guys, what if we are in a massive bullmarket? The most generated fees will come from Splash Protocol and Optim Finance! 

So if the ODAO is a Topholder in vesplash tokens, they will bring the most rewards to the pools from Optim Finance, the OADA pools.

Check out taptools and look at the markets. Splash Protocol and Snek.Fun are almost head to head with Minswap allready! Splash has allready more trades!

This is mega bullish to me guys!

See this as a very helpfull warning from the universe😜.

UFO crash retrieval evidence and lack thereof ,UFOresearchers,1i636dp,2025-01-20 17:32:21,2,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/wle1wynw68ee1.jpeg,esosecretgnosis,,"Since the 1970s, when UFO investigator Leonard Stringfield began publishing his collections of accounts of UFO crashes and US military involvement in the aftermath, the topic has garnered intense interest in the world of ufology.

One of the problems with these accounts is clearly a lack of data. The stories by their very nature are extremely difficult, bordering on impossible, to investigate sufficiently, since in the majority of the accounts the US military collects all the material evidence and attempts to keep the alleged events under a shroud of secrecy.

Analyzing the recent crash retrieval account that has been presented to the public, I find it troubling that the account contains even less useful data than in historic accounts which have been documented, setting aside for now the manner in which it was presented.

The following excerpts detail a number of historic UFO crash retrieval accounts:

ABSTRACT VI: official investigation of crashed
object; armed guard on tiny dead ufonaut

Research Director for MUFON, Raymond E.
Fowler of Wenham, Massachusetts, watched incredulously as Fritz Werner signed the following affidavit, dated June 7, 1973:

“I, Fritz Werner, do solemnly swear that, during
a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on
May 21, 1953, I assisted in the investigation of a
crashed unknown object in the vicinity of
Kingman, Arizona.

“The object was constructed of an unfamiliar
metal which resembled aluminium. It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without any sign of structural damage. It was oval and about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been
vertically lowered and opened. It was about 3 1/2
feet high and 1 1/2 feet wide. I was able to talk
bricfly with someone on the team who did look
inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an
oval cabin, and a lot of instruments and displays.

“A tent pitched near the object sheltered the
dead remains of the only occupant of the craft.
It was about 4 feet tall, with dark brown com-
plexion and it had 2 eyes, 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and a
small round mouth. It was clothed in a silvery,
metallic suit and wore a skull cap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering or helmet.

“I certify that the above statement is true by
affixing my signature to this document on this
7th day of June, 1973.

According to Ray Fowler, a researcher of the highest credentials, here is Werner’s story:

“I was project engineer on an Air Force contract
with the Atomic Energy Commission for
‘Operation Upshot-Knothole’ at the atomic
proving ground, Nevada. My job involved the
measuring of blast effects on various types of
buildings especially erected for the tests.

“On May 20, 1953, I worked most of the day at
Frenchman Flat. In the evening, I received a phone
call from the test director. Dr. Ed Doil, informing
me that I was to go on a special job the next day.
On the following day, I reported for special duty,
and was driven to Indian Springs Air Force Base,
near the proving ground, where I joined about
fifteen other specialists. We were told to leave all
valuables in the custody of the military police. We
were then put on a military plane and flown to
Phoenix, Arizona. We were not allowed to
fraternize. There, we were put on a bus with other
personnel, who were there. The bus windows were blacked out so that we couldn't see where we were going. We rode for an estimated four hours. I think we were in the area of Kingman, Arizona, which is North West of Phoenix and not too far from the atomic proving ground in Nevada. During the bus trip, we were told by an Air Force full colonel that a super-secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and that, since we were all specialists in certain fields, we were to investigate the crash in terms of our own speciality and nothing more.

“Finally, the bus stopped and we disembarked
one at a time as our names were called, and were
escorted by military police to the area that we
were to inspect. Two spotlights were centered on
the crashed object, which was ringed with guards.
The lights were so bright that it was impossible to
see the surrounding area. The object was oval and
looked like two deep saucers, one inverted upon
the other. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with
convex surfaces, top and bottom. These surfaces
were about twenty feet in diameter. It was constructed of a dull silver metal, like brushed aluminium. The metal was darker where the saucer ‘lips’ formed a rim, around which were what looked like ‘slots.’ A curved open hatch door was located on the leading end and was vertically
lowered. There was a light coming from inside
but it could have been installed by the Air Force.

“My particular job was to determine, from the
angle and depth of impact into the sand, how
fast the vehicle’s forward and vertical velocities
were at the time of impact. The impact had forced the vehicle approximately twenty inches into the sand. There was no landing gear. There were also no marks or dents, that I can remember, on the surface — not even scratches. Questions having nothing to do with our own special areas were not answered,

“An armed military policeman guarded a tent
pitched nearby. I managed to glance inside at one
point, and saw the dead body of a four-foot,
human-like creature in a silver metallic-looking
suit. The skin on its face was dark brown. This
may have been caused by exposure to our atmos-
phere. The face was not covered but it had a
metallic skull-cap device on its head.

“As soon as each person finished his task, he
was interviewed over a tape recorder and escorted back to the bus. On the way back to the
bus, I managed to talk briefly with someone else
going back to it at the same time. He told me that
he had glanced inside the object and saw two
swivel-like seats, as well as instruments and
displays. An airman who noticed we were talking
separated us and warned us not to talk with
each other.

“After we all returned to the bus, the Air Force
colonel who was in charge had us raise our right
hands and take an oath not to reveal what we had
experienced. [ was instructed to write my report
in longhand and not to type or reproduce it. A
telephone number was given to me to call when the report was complete. I called the number, and an airman picked up the report.

Ray Fowler states that Werner held several engineering and management positions at Wright-Patterson AFB between June 1949, and January, 1960.

During that period, he worked in the Office of
Special Studies of what was then the Air Material
Command Installations Division, Later, he designed aircraft landing gear, and became Chief of alighting devices within the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center. At the time of the alleged incident, he was on assignment to the Atomic Energy Commission at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada.

Fowler also states that Werner told him that he
sympathized with the Air Force’s secret handling of the UFO problem and added that the Air Force did not know where UFOs originated. Werner also said that the Air Force believed that the UFOs were interplanetary vehicles but that they did not know how to handle the situation. They did not want to create panic.

Comments Fowler: There were some inconsistencies in Werner's story, but most of them appeared to be in the realm of memory lapses and exaggerations by the witness. Former employers that were checked held him in high esteem, and all described him as a highly competent and moral individual. Having
published a number of technical papers, Werner also holds membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In Fowler's continuing evaluation he cites one
piece of evidence which seems to give a strong
element of truth to Werner’s account. In an attempt to pin down the exact date of the alleged incident, Werner agreed to show his diary he kept in those days. On its aging pages, for May 20, 1953, it read in part: ‘Well, pen’s out of ink. Spent most of day on Frenchman's Flat surveying cubicles and supervising welding of a (one word illegible) bridge which cracked after last shot. Got funny call from Dr. Doll at 1000. I’m going on a special job tomorrow.” On May 2nd, the diary read: “Up at 7.00. Worked most of day on Frenchman with cubicles. Letter from Bet. She’s feeling better now — thank goodness. Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB at 4.30 p.m. for a job I can’t write or talk about.”

Comment:

In my book Situation Red, | cover the Werner
story in full, based on my conversations with Ray
Fowler. Said Fowler, “With more substantiation, it
could blow the lid off secrecy.” I agree. One final
note: the name Fritz Werner is fictitious, but I feel
that his story, although embellished, is basically
true. One Intelligence source commented: “A lot
of it is story.”

ABSTRACT 6

Finally a name of a witness surfaces - an Air Force Major named Daly - who was
a metallurgist stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. He relates his adventures
with a crashed UFO.
The source for this information comes from fellow Cincinnati-based researcher,
Charles Wilhelm. A friend of Charles' father, he related in 1968, that in April 1953
he was flown to a destination unknown, where it was hot and sandy, to examine
the crashed UFO. He was blindfolded and driven to a point about 30 minutes away
from the base of operations. There, inside a tent, standing in soft sand, his
blindfold was removed. From there he was taken to a location where he saw a
silvery metallic craft about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The exterior of the craft, he
said, was not damaged. However, his on-the-spot two day analysis of the ship's
metal, using the equipment he carried with him, showed that it was not native to
Earth. Major Daly, although he was not permitted to enter the craft, observed that
the craft's entrance measured four to five feet high and two to three feet wide.

COMMENT:
Major Daly's blindfolded trip to the crash site, similar to that of Fritz Werner's,
indicates that it was common procedure for the military to use extreme security
measures relative to UFO retrievals. It is to be noted that Major Daly's experience
takes place in April 1953, a month shy of Fritz Werner's which was in May 1953.
Also, to be noted is that Daly did not see any dead alien bodies. Maybe they had
already been removed? Or, if the craft was found undamaged, as he attested, it is
possible the occupants managed to evade capture? Or, perhaps, there were two crashes in a desert area in the Spring of 1953. If, however, both the reports of
Werner and Daly are describing the same crashed UFO event, it is possible that
Daly used the wrong month.

ABSTRACT XIX: Crashing object said to have been
tracked on radar: occupants badly burned

Following my lecture on April 6, 1978, before the
Cincinnati Chapter of World Wings Association — a gathering of 50 or more pilots — I was approached by a highly reputable member of the Association who knew of ""a person at work’’ who, in turn, knew about crashed UFOs and occupants. I promptly got in touch.

On April 18, 1978, I talked with former Air Force
Sergeant M.S. of the 97th Bomber Wing. He was prepared to relate the data from a high intelligence source relative to the retrieval of an alien craft and humanoid occupants maintained at Wright-Patterson AFB. He also related a sobering story about a landing on an air force base, also from the same high source.

M.S., while serving at Wright-Patterson in 1977, made close acquaintance with a Major General whose last name begins with the letter ‘‘T’’, and who was assigned to Wright-Patterson for top security work in the Logistics Command. His rank and the nature of his work entitled him to an airplane at his disposal at all times.

The General's daughter, (name known to me) and
M.S. were seriously lovelorn, and on that basis were frequently together. This allowed M.S. to be the guest at the General's home, where he and the General had private chats. Both being endowed with the highest security ratings, they discussed UFOs.

From General ‘‘T’’, my informant related, details were disclosed concerning a UFO that had crashed in the southwest region of the United States in 1957. At that time, General ‘‘T’’ was Lt. Colonel ‘‘T’'. According to the General, radar had confirmed that an alien craft had crossed the skies over the United States at great speed. It was tracked to the point of its crash. The area, as in most cases, was ‘‘roped off’ and the National Guard summoned (with dogs) for maximum security.

From the damaged craft, four humanoid bodies were recovered with great difficulty because of the inability to penetrate the craft's metal structure. The deceased bodies were found badly burned, some parts so severely that certain features were indistinguishable. However, the suits they wore — appearing silver — were not damaged by the obviously intense heat endured inside the craft. Said the General: ‘‘The suits were fused to the flesh.""’

M. S. said that, according to the General, the four
bodies, approximately 5 feet in height, were sent to Wright-Patterson AFB, where General  ""T’’ had seen them in a deep freeze morgue, kept at approximately 120 degrees below zero for preservation. The only other atomical features described by General ‘‘T’’ were the heads of the aliens which, by human standards, were larger proportionately than the bodies. Facial features had been obliterated by the heat.

The craft? The General related that scientists assigned to the task of dismantling it ran into difficulty. To get inside they concentrated in an area where a fissure or crack had resulted, probably from impact. Shipment to Wright-Patterson, said the General, was by rail, properly camouflaged and classified as ‘‘rockets’’, and using two military rocket conveyance cars.

On another occasion, M.S., while a guest of General ""T"" at his home, and while they were alone, was shown a Top Secret document concerning a landed UFO. The incident had occurred at Nellis AFB, Nevada, in 1968, and M.S. expressed disbelief when he read the report.

Stamped TOP SECRET, it read, in part: Large UFO hovered over Nellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (or being ejected) from parent craft. One landed on the air base grounds. Sent to greet the landed craft was a Colonel escorted by a security detachment properly armed. There was no mention of any attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, a humanoid was observed to disembark from the craft. He was described as ‘‘short and stocky"". Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next in command for his troops of the security detachment to fire, but their weapons were mysteriously jammed. The Colonel was recovered and hospitalized. The only recall by the Colonel, as M.S. remembers from the report, was that he could rationalize the event only in terms of mathematics, as though an attempt at communications was conducted in this
manner. The UFO was observed to retreat to its parent craft which then departed.

Comment

I made a check on General ""T’’ at Wright-Patterson. They had no entry on his secret assignment there. However, a check at another air base through the Accounting and Finance Section, confirmed his existence. No address was released on grounds of the Privacy Act, but M.S. knew where the General was to make his residence after retirement.

Making a further check on the authenticity of the
General, and on his knowledge of secret UFO reports, I checked with another Intelligence source and obtained additional corroborative information concerning the Nellis AFB incident.

was interviewed over a tape recorder and escorted back to the bus. On the way back to the
bus, I managed to talk briefly with someone else
going back to it at the same time. He told me that
he had glanced inside the object and saw two
swivel-like seats, as well as instruments and
displays. An airman who noticed we were talking
separated us and warned us not to talk with
each other.

“After we all returned to the bus, the Air Force
colonel who was in charge had us raise our right
hands and take an oath not to reveal what we had
experienced. [ was instructed to write my report
in longhand and not to type or reproduce it. A
telephone number was given to me to call when the report was complete. I called the number, and an airman picked up the report.

Ray Fowler states that Werner held several engineering and management positions at Wright-Patterson AFB between June 1949, and January, 1960.

During that period, he worked in the Office of
Special Studies of what was then the Air Material
Command Installations Division, Later, he designed aircraft landing gear, and became Chief of alighting devices within the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center. At the time of the alleged incident, he was on assignment to the Atomic Energy Commission at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada.

Fowler also states that Werner told him that he
sympathized with the Air Force’s secret handling of the UFO problem and added that the Air Force did not know where UFOs originated. Werner also said that the Air Force believed that the UFOs were interplanetary vehicles but that they did not know how to handle the situation. They did not want to create panic.

Comments Fowler: There were some inconsistencies in Werner's story, but most of them appeared to be in the realm of memory lapses and exaggerations by the witness. Former employers that were checked held him in high esteem, and all described him as a highly competent and moral individual. Having
published a number of technical papers, Werner also holds membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In Fowler's continuing evaluation he cites one
piece of evidence which seems to give a strong
element of truth to Werner’s account. In an attempt to pin down the exact date of the alleged incident, Werner agreed to show his diary he kept in those days. On its aging pages, for May 20, 1953, it read in part: ‘Well, pen’s out of ink. Spent most of day on Frenchman's Flat surveying cubicles and supervising welding of a (one word illegible) bridge which cracked after last shot. Got funny call from Dr. Doll at 1000. I’m going on a special job tomorrow.” On May 2nd, the diary read: “Up at 7.00. Worked most of day on Frenchman with cubicles. Letter from Bet. She’s feeling better now — thank goodness. Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB at 4.30 p.m. for a job I can’t write or talk about.”

Comment:

In my book Situation Red, | cover the Werner
story in full, based on my conversations with Ray
Fowler. Said Fowler, “With more substantiation, it
could blow the lid off secrecy.” I agree. One final
note: the name Fritz Werner is fictitious, but I feel
that his story, although embellished, is basically
true. One Intelligence source commented: “A lot
of it is story.”

ABSTRACT 6

Finally a name of a witness surfaces - an Air Force Major named Daly - who was
a metallurgist stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. He relates his adventures
with a crashed UFO.
The source for this information comes from fellow Cincinnati-based researcher,
Charles Wilhelm. A friend of Charles' father, he related in 1968, that in April 1953
he was flown to a destination unknown, where it was hot and sandy, to examine
the crashed UFO. He was blindfolded and driven to a point about 30 minutes away
from the base of operations. There, inside a tent, standing in soft sand, his
blindfold was removed. From there he was taken to a location where he saw a
silvery metallic craft about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The exterior of the craft, he
said, was not damaged. However, his on-the-spot two day analysis of the ship's
metal, using the equipment he carried with him, showed that it was not native to
Earth. Major Daly, although he was not permitted to enter the craft, observed that
the craft's entrance measured four to five feet high and two to three feet wide.

COMMENT:
Major Daly's blindfolded trip to the crash site, similar to that of Fritz Werner's,
indicates that it was common procedure for the military to use extreme security
measures relative to UFO retrievals. It is to be noted that Major Daly's experience
takes place in April 1953, a month shy of Fritz Werner's which was in May 1953.
Also, to be noted is that Daly did not see any dead alien bodies. Maybe they had
already been removed? Or, if the craft was found undamaged, as he attested, it is
possible the occupants managed to evade capture? Or, perhaps, there were two crashes in a desert area in the Spring of 1953. If, however, both the reports of
Werner and Daly are describing the same crashed UFO event, it is possible that
Daly used the wrong month.

ABSTRACT XIX: Crashing object said to have been
tracked on radar: occupants badly burned

Following my lecture on April 6, 1978, before the
Cincinnati Chapter of World Wings Association — a gathering of 50 or more pilots — I was approached by a highly reputable member of the Association who knew of ""a person at work’’ who, in turn, knew about crashed UFOs and occupants. I promptly got in touch.

On April 18, 1978, I talked with former Air Force
Sergeant M.S. of the 97th Bomber Wing. He was prepared to relate the data from a high intelligence source relative to the retrieval of an alien craft and humanoid occupants maintained at Wright-Patterson AFB. He also related a sobering story about a landing on an air force base, also from the same high source.

M.S., while serving at Wright-Patterson in 1977, made close acquaintance with a Major General whose last name begins with the letter ‘‘T’’, and who was assigned to Wright-Patterson for top security work in the Logistics Command. His rank and the nature of his work entitled him to an airplane at his disposal at all times.

The General's daughter, (name known to me) and
M.S. were seriously lovelorn, and on that basis were frequently together. This allowed M.S. to be the guest at the General's home, where he and the General had private chats. Both being endowed with the highest security ratings, they discussed UFOs.

From General ‘‘T’’, my informant related, details were disclosed concerning a UFO that had crashed in the southwest region of the United States in 1957. At that time, General ‘‘T’’ was Lt. Colonel ‘‘T’'. According to the General, radar had confirmed that an alien craft had crossed the skies over the United States at great speed. It was tracked to the point of its crash. The area, as in most cases, was ‘‘roped off’ and the National Guard summoned (with dogs) for maximum security.

From the damaged craft, four humanoid bodies were recovered with great difficulty because of the inability to penetrate the craft's metal structure. The deceased bodies were found badly burned, some parts so severely that certain features were indistinguishable. However, the suits they wore — appearing silver — were not damaged by the obviously intense heat endured inside the craft. Said the General: ‘‘The suits were fused to the flesh.""’

M. S. said that, according to the General, the four
bodies, approximately 5 feet in height, were sent to Wright-Patterson AFB, where General  ""T’’ had seen them in a deep freeze morgue, kept at approximately 120 degrees below zero for preservation. The only other atomical features described by General ‘‘T’’ were the heads of the aliens which, by human standards, were larger proportionately than the bodies. Facial features had been obliterated by the heat.

The craft? The General related that scientists assigned to the task of dismantling it ran into difficulty. To get inside they concentrated in an area where a fissure or crack had resulted, probably from impact. Shipment to Wright-Patterson, said the General, was by rail, properly camouflaged and classified as ‘‘rockets’’, and using two military rocket conveyance cars.

On another occasion, M.S., while a guest of General ""T"" at his home, and while they were alone, was shown a Top Secret document concerning a landed UFO. The incident had occurred at Nellis AFB, Nevada, in 1968, and M.S. expressed disbelief when he read the report.

Stamped TOP SECRET, it read, in part: Large UFO hovered over Nellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (or being ejected) from parent craft. One landed on the air base grounds. Sent to greet the landed craft was a Colonel escorted by a security detachment properly armed. There was no mention of any attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, a humanoid was observed to disembark from the craft. He was described as ‘‘short and stocky"". Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next in command for his troops of the security detachment to fire, but their weapons were mysteriously jammed. The Colonel was recovered and hospitalized. The only recall by the Colonel, as M.S. remembers from the report, was that he could rationalize the event only in terms of mathematics, as though an attempt at communications was conducted in this
manner. The UFO was observed to retreat to its parent craft which then departed.

Comment

I made a check on General ""T’’ at Wright-Patterson. They had no entry on his secret assignment there. However, a check at another air base through the Accounting and Finance Section, confirmed his existence. No address was released on grounds of the Privacy Act, but M.S. knew where the General was to make his residence after retirement.

Making a further check on the authenticity of the
General, and on his knowledge of secret UFO reports, I checked with another Intelligence source and obtained additional corroborative information concerning the Nellis AFB incident.

What is hot in statistics research nowadays [Research]	,statistics,1i34tv6,2025-01-16 20:19:14,289,0.95,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1i34tv6/what_is_hot_in_statistics_research_nowadays/,EgregiousJellybean,Research,"I recently attended a conference and got to see a talk by Daniela Witten (UW) and another talk from Bin Yu (Berkeley). I missed another talk by Rebecca Willett (U of C) on scientific machine learning. This leads me to wonder,

**What's hot in the field of stats research?**

AI / machine learning is hot for obvious reasons, and it gets lots of funding (according to a rather eccentric theoretical CS professor, 'quantum' and 'machine learning' are the hot topics for grant funding).

**I think that more traditional statistics departments that don't embrace AI / machine learning are going to be at a disadvantage, relatively speaking, if they don't adapt.** 

Some topics I thought of off the top of my head are: selective inference, machine learning UQ (relatively few pure stats departments seem to be doing this, largely these are stats departments at schools with very strong CS departments like Berkeley and CMU), fair AI, and AI for science. (AI for science / SciML has more of an applied math flavor rather than stats, but profs like Willett and Lu Lu (Yale) are technically stats faculty).

Here's the report on hot topics that ChatGPT gave me, but keep in mind that the training data stops at 2023.

# 1. Causal Inference and Causal Machine Learning

* **Why it's hot:** Traditional statistical models focus on associations, but many real-world questions require understanding causality (e.g., ""What happens if we intervene?""). Machine learning methods, like causal forests and double machine learning, are being developed to handle high-dimensional and complex causal inference problems.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Causal discovery from observational data.
   * Robustness of causal estimates under unmeasured confounding.
   * Applications in personalized medicine and policy evaluation.
* **Emerging tools:**
   * DoWhy, EconML (Microsoft’s library for causal machine learning).
   * Structural causal models (SCMs) for modeling complex causal systems.

# 2. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Machine Learning

* **Why it's hot:** Machine learning models are powerful but often lack reliable uncertainty estimates. Statistics is stepping in to provide rigorous uncertainty measures for these models.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Bayesian deep learning for uncertainty.
   * Conformal prediction for distribution-free prediction intervals.
   * Out-of-distribution detection and calibration of predictive models.
* **Applications:** Autonomous systems, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive decision-making.

# 3. High-Dimensional Statistics

* **Why it's hot:** In modern data problems, the number of parameters often exceeds the number of observations (e.g., genomics, neuroimaging). High-dimensional methods enable effective inference and prediction in such settings.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Sparse regression (e.g., LASSO, Elastic Net).
   * Low-rank matrix estimation and tensor decomposition.
   * High-dimensional hypothesis testing and variable selection.
* **Emerging directions:** Handling non-convex objectives, incorporating deep learning priors.

# 4. Statistical Learning Theory

* **Why it's hot:** As machine learning continues to dominate, there’s a need to understand its theoretical underpinnings. Statistical learning theory bridges the gap between ML practice and mathematical guarantees.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Generalization bounds for deep learning models.
   * PAC-Bayes theory and information-theoretic approaches.
   * Optimization landscapes in over-parameterized models (e.g., neural networks).
* **Hot debates:** Why do deep networks generalize despite being over-parameterized?

# 5. Robust and Distribution-Free Inference

* **Why it's hot:** Classical statistical methods often rely on strong assumptions (e.g., Gaussian errors, exchangeability). New methods relax these assumptions to handle real-world, messy data.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Conformal inference for prediction intervals under minimal assumptions.
   * Robust statistics for heavy-tailed and contaminated data.
   * Nonparametric inference under weaker assumptions.
* **Emerging directions:** Intersection with adversarial robustness in machine learning.

# 6. Foundations of Bayesian Computation

* **Why it's hot:** Bayesian methods are powerful but computationally expensive for large-scale data. Research focuses on making them more scalable and reliable.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
   * Variational inference and its theoretical guarantees.
   * Bayesian neural networks and approximate posterior inference.
* **Emerging directions:** Integrating physics-informed priors with Bayesian computation for scientific modeling.

# 7. Statistical Challenges in Deep Learning

* **Why it's hot:** Deep learning models are incredibly complex, and their statistical properties are poorly understood. Researchers are exploring:
   * Generalization in over-parameterized models.
   * Statistical interpretations of training dynamics.
   * Compression, pruning, and distillation of models.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Implicit regularization in gradient descent.
   * Role of model architecture in statistical performance.
   * Probabilistic embeddings and generative models.

# 8. Federated and Privacy-Preserving Learning

* **Why it's hot:** The growing focus on data privacy and decentralized data motivates statistical advances in federated learning and differential privacy.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Differentially private statistical estimation.
   * Communication-efficient federated learning.
   * Privacy-utility trade-offs in statistical models.
* **Applications:** Healthcare data sharing, collaborative AI, and secure financial analytics.

# 9. Spatial and Spatiotemporal Statistics

* **Why it's hot:** The explosion of spatial data from satellites, sensors, and mobile devices has led to advancements in spatiotemporal modeling.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Gaussian processes for spatial modeling.
   * Nonstationary and multiresolution models.
   * Scalable methods for massive spatiotemporal datasets.
* **Applications:** Climate modeling, epidemiology (COVID-19 modeling), urban planning.

# 10. Statistics for Complex Data Structures

* **Why it's hot:** Modern data is often non-Euclidean (e.g., networks, manifolds, point clouds). New statistical methods are being developed to handle these structures.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Graphical models and network statistics.
   * Statistical inference on manifolds.
   * Topological data analysis (TDA) for extracting features from high-dimensional data.
* **Applications:** Social networks, neuroscience (brain connectomes), and shape analysis.

# 11. Fairness and Bias in Machine Learning

* **Why it's hot:** As ML systems are deployed widely, there’s an urgent need to ensure fairness and mitigate bias.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Statistical frameworks for fairness (e.g., equalized odds, demographic parity).
   * Testing and correcting algorithmic bias.
   * Trade-offs between fairness, accuracy, and interpretability.
* **Applications:** Hiring algorithms, lending, criminal justice, and medical AI.

# 12. Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision Making

* **Why it's hot:** RL is critical for applications like robotics and personalized interventions, but statistical aspects are underexplored.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Exploration-exploitation trade-offs in high-dimensional settings.
   * Offline RL (learning from logged data).
   * Bayesian RL and uncertainty-aware policies.
* **Applications:** Healthcare (adaptive treatment strategies), finance, and game AI.

# 13. Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Data

* **Why it's hot:** Big data challenges computational efficiency and interpretability of classical methods.
* **Key ideas:**
   * Scalable algorithms for massive datasets (e.g., distributed optimization).
   * Approximate inference techniques for high-dimensional data.
   * Subsampling and sketching for faster computations."

Bio/Stats Major at Penn looking to switch into Applied math PhD,mathematics,1i0xh5y,2025-01-13 22:58:29,1,0.56,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/1i0xh5y/biostats_major_at_penn_looking_to_switch_into/,EqualUnderstanding57,,"Hello all. I'm a second semester senior at Penn majoring in biology and finance. In undergrad, I have explored a number of things. I've worked in a wet cell biology lab and learned a lot of experimental biology. I also may publish a paper as second author (no math though). I have 4 co-first author papers in healthcare systems (1 of which is in a decent journal). I may get 3 more in JAMA-level journals as middle author this semester. I also won some entrepreneurship awards and interned at a major investment bank in the IBD division.

I've been curious about math and took a linear algebra class last semester and got an A. I'm taking convex optimization, probability, and multivariable calc (not proof based) this semester. Hopefully I get all As. I've been really interested in the field of protein folding and want to dedicate the rest of my life to developing protein design models. Hence I have been considering spending some time after college studying/working to prep for a top applied math PhD (prestige does matter to me a bit -- I will apply either bioengineering or applied math to top schools, and if I don't get applied math, try to supplement bioengineering with applied math classes).

I'm planning on taking numerical analysis, ODEs, PDEs, optimization, stochastics, and real analysis after I graduate as a non degree student at a state school. Then I plan to work in algorithm design at a top protein design lab. I'm a relentless hard worker so I think it will be possible to make this switch. My main question is, is this background enough to get into a top (Princeton, Harvard, NYU) applied math program? (maybe not NYU because I will shoot for more applied programs, which ones are more applied by the way?)

Edit: I have a 4.0 so far across classes like cell biology, immunobiology, finance, accounting, etc."

to make my decision, i looked at curves, 50 SMA and 50 HMA, RSI, MACD and Shinohara indicators .. can't say much about Shinohara, very new to me, but it's a velocity indicator pretty much, how explosive can something get

summary : it's a combination of factors that tell you if yes or no, something has potential to go up or won't .. and sometimes, even if all the stars are aligned, it's a cloudly sky at night

now regarding the strikes, i did some basic maths, looking at how much would be needed to make profit ; 129 was appealing for it's reachability, given what i saw on the curves and stuff, i was confident to see a 3.50-4.00% move early on .. 2 days of RSI low-high, curves pointing up, MACD pointing up, Shinohara gaping up (high higher, low lower) .. very feasable - especially when it just had a decent drop

edit - and one last thing, if you doubt yourself, check it two times, if you still doubt, move on .. i had quite a lot of confidence over my picks over the list, and this one was ""cute"" and all .. glad i headshot the perfect strike .. but it was also luck .. i did whole list for the testing side of things, but this was one of my favs, along with APA and CVX"

They have never seen the curvature of the financial world from the necessary heights (or depths if we invert convexity) to truly understand the forces at play. 

Bitcoin skeptics often have a rudimentary understanding of finance, economics, computer science, cryptography, monetary history, game theory etc. and the complex interactions of these advanced factors driving bitcoin to new heights. They often conflate currency with money and cannot come to terms with the cognitive dissonance created by their antiquated beliefs in the face of an advanced asset like bitcoin. 

It has become increasing evident that only bitcoiners truly grasp the esoteric reality of the global monetary system and its gross failings. As a result, bitcoiner will be rewarded with vast wealth to empower their genius and foresight even further into the future.

Buy them when they ain't - my method for buying penny stocks,pennystocks,1hp3mxm,2024-12-29 14:28:16,1015,0.97,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hp3mxm/buy_them_when_they_aint_my_method_for_buying/,value1024,:DDNerd: 🄳🄳 :DDNerd:,"Hey all,

I have posted several DDs here, most recently a bullish thesis on [$MGX](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1gqe7sw/mgx_a_stock_billionaires_dont_want_you_to_own/) and [$LGMK](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1ge52k7/lgmk_is_this_about_to_go_private_market_cap_700k/) which went up 100% since my DD posts, as well as scan results/polls on shortsqueeze, the most recent of which is the Thanksgiving special that had huge winners like QXAI, UAVS, and MTEM, all in a couple weeks since the post.

So how do I find these stocks before they make significant moves? Here is my list of general factor categories, so while I will not divulge the exact criteria, these are the factors I focus on:

1. Higher order thinking and game theory - I do not buy stocks I like personally, but ones that I think are most appealing to most people with funds destined for those types of trades. See more below.
2. Fundamental factors - I screen using financial ratios which most funds use for finding value and growth, ideally combined. I do not focus on ""deep value"" only, and I am OK buying zero revenue early stage biotechs if they have promising technology.
3. Informed trading factor - I like when insiders are buying their stock, and insiders who are not treating the stock like their own piggy bank with dilution and death spiral last resort financing. They know more than we will ever know, so if the stock is cheap and they start buying I join them in the trade.
4. Share statistics and short interest factors - I look for high short ratios and high percentage of float short because when heavily shorted, the stocks end up trading like call options, i.e. they have high convexity and pent up upward pressure
5. Technical analysis factors - I use technical price and volume custom indicators, and I make sure that I am not buying on the way down but after a consolidation and when a stock is just beginning to get signs of new energy, i.e. new money flowing back into it and sellers not willing to sell at those levels.
6. Sentiment factors - in the opposite manner of how most people here trade, I hate it when a stock I find with my scanners is being touted on reddit and elsewhere, so I avoid it, and I look for unpopular stocks which have not yet made a splash on social media. I aim to be in before the crowd and out before the stock is spammed all over.
7. Trading mechanics - I trade small, with 10% of my portfolio dedicated to these speculative stocks a maximum of 1% in each stock. My stop losses used to be 20% or 2 weeks whichever comes first, but as we saw with MGX, this is too restrictive, so my stop is more like 30% and 4 weeks, whichever comes first. Taking profits is something I don't like to talk about because everyone is different when it comes to risk/return, but depending on the stock, it ranges from 20% to over 100%. I rarely wait for 10X type returns on a single stock, because that is a recipe for bagholding, eventually.

I hope that you found these pointers useful, and that you did not TLDR looking for tickers. I do scan weekly for several types of trades and I post most of them publicly, in near real time. I also post DDs on deep dives, and I always disclose that I have positions in the stocks I write about.

Good luck in your trading, stay small, take quick profits and losses, and be generally careful trading small caps.

Cheers!"
"Weekend Digest: 2025 Focus, $GOOGL, Oil Stocks, AI ($NVDA $AMD $AMZN) & a Looming Correction?",InnerCircleInvesting,1hp0td8,2024-12-29 12:24:49,10,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1hp0td8/weekend_digest_2025_focus_googl_oil_stocks_ai/,InnerCircleTI,Market Thoughts,"Let's take a look at some of the stories I found most interesting this weekend as we prepare for the final two days of trading to end 2024. 2025 will mark the third potential year of stunning return possibility and the party can't go on forever. At the same time, there's no law that says it can't and the environment still looks ripe for gains. It always makes sense to stay objective and survey the near-term future for investable themes.

**Areas to Focus on in 2025**

This short read (longer video) sums up many of my thoughts about the year ahead, especially related to the potential need to rotate some profitable holdings into other areas of the market that have yet to perform. I do this rotation often as bull markets rage on. Additionally, the higher-for-longer rate environment does suggest that things could remain in a more parity-based relationship, at least between bonds and equities.

**Google Remains Focused**

Google proved once again why you can't be too knee-jerky when it comes to acute news/information stories, even if they seem to have legs. I see this time and again where old stories, or new ones, erupt at nearly perfect timing to take a stock further down or much higher. Over 35 years in these markets, I learned long ago that news and events do not happen by chance in many cases. 

For Google, fears of their AI product, Gemini, was falling behind others started the fall. Then there was a piling on effect from OpenAI's excitement about their new search engine and browser, adding potential lost advertising revenue fears. Then the final blow was from our own government talking ""break up"" due to monopolistic advantage. All it took was for the behemoth to show progress on their quantum computing technology (Willow) and the stock raced to new highs.

**Oil Stocks Beaten**

One sector I've been watching for potential income + appreciation has been that of oil. I usually look at a complex of CVX, XOM, SLB, OXY, etc. Look at any of these, and you'll see material declines over the past three quarters, potentially setting up a nice yield play. I had last rotated into XOM at about $100 (out of CVX) when I saw an appealing gap+income opportunity. Sure enough, XOM rallied about 20% and I exited. Now with XOM and OXY hitting the skids again, I found myself eyeing one/both. Here's a little story about 2025 expectations for oil.

[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Analysts-Are-Bearish-on-Crude-Oil-in-2025.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Analysts-Are-Bearish-on-Crude-Oil-in-2025.html)

**AI (forecast) in Focus**

Shocking headline, right? In the linked story you get thoughts of a parapsychologist and hedge fund manager. A dire warning about $NVDA, and potential hack of crypto are discussed. In fact, I sold my bitcoin years ago on the fear that a hack would eventually crater the price. That may still be the case, but I missed a spectacular run. Oops. And what forecast wouldn't be complete without discussion of quantum computing (QC). But what I found/find most interesting about this piece was the ongoing discussion about AI power and the oncoming rush of AI agents.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-fund-manager-reveals-startling-130300201.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-fund-manager-reveals-startling-130300201.html)

And here's a continuing look at what could be in the cards for $NVDA and other competitors like $AMD, $AMZN and $MSFT. There is a continuing and growing theme that NVDA is going to have a far more difficult 2025, all the while their chip backlog remains 1+ years last I heard.

**Correction Coming?**

It's most certainly coming, but it's all about timing. Corrections and bear markets are normal occurrences and even healthy following a raging bull. Despite my best  predictive modeling, I can't hope to know when this occurs and calling for a correction in the future is like predicting rain in the PacNW. I will say I got 2022's decline dead on with decline though the timing took a few months longer than I expected. I'm seeing a similar setup again and my path is one of less exposure as we head into the end of Q1. I don't want to be uninvested but I will be rotating out of some hot money trades, taking some profits off the table and moving to safety and yield. I'm setting a goal of at least 30% fixed income for my primary (IRA) account, a figure it has never seen.

Understanding how markets function and the psychology behind decision-making is crucial in financial models. Traditional financial theories assume that markets are efficient and investors are rational. However, human behavior often deviates from these assumptions, leading to the development of behavioral finance and alternative decision-making models like prospect theory. This chapter explores these foundational ideas, providing insights into both efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and the psychological factors driving market anomalies and investor behavior.

# Outline of Chapter 6

1. Section 6.1: Market Efficiency
2. Section 6.2: Three Forms of Efficient Market Hypothesis
3. Section 6.3: Examples of Market Inefficiency and Anomalies
4. Section 6.4: Behavioral Finance
5. Section 6.5: Introduction to Prospect Theory

# Section 6.1: Market Efficiency

# The Concept of Market Efficiency

Market efficiency assumes that financial markets are highly competitive, with participants acting swiftly to exploit irrational prices. This competition restores prices to their fair value, incorporating all relevant information. Consequently, asset prices follow a **random walk**, where:

* Current prices reflect all available information.
* New information is unpredictable and causes random price movements.

# Examples of Random Walk Models

1. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
2. Binomial Model (random walk with drift)

These models emphasize that price changes are driven by new, unanticipated information.

# Section 6.2: Three Forms of Efficient Market Hypothesis

The **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** posits that professional investors struggle to outperform simple strategies like index investing. It suggests markets are efficient to varying degrees:

# 1. Weak Form EMH

* Asset prices reflect all historical price and trading data.
* Implication: Technical analysis (e.g., chart patterns) is ineffective.

# 2. Semi-Strong Form EMH

* Asset prices incorporate all publicly available information (e.g., earnings reports, economic data).
* Implication: Active portfolio management is unproductive; passive investment strategies (e.g., index funds) are optimal.

# 3. Strong Form EMH

* Asset prices reflect all information, both public and insider knowledge.
* Implication: Insider trading regulations become redundant. Without insider participation, prices might not reflect private information.

# Section 6.3: Examples of Market Inefficiency and Anomalies

Despite the theoretical elegance of EMH, numerous examples of market inefficiencies challenge its validity:

# Common Market Anomalies

1. **Under-Reaction and Over-Reaction:** Markets may respond too slowly or excessively to new information.
2. **Momentum Effect:** Assets that perform well in the short term tend to continue outperforming.
3. **Fallen Angel:** Previously high-performing stocks that decline significantly may rebound.
4. **Small-Firm Effect:** Smaller firms often generate higher returns than larger ones.
5. **January Effect:** Stocks, particularly small-cap ones, tend to perform well in January due to seasonal factors.

# Insights:

Markets are highly efficient, but superior analytical skills and insights can occasionally enable investors to outperform.

# Section 6.4: Behavioral Finance

Behavioral finance examines the psychological traits influencing investor decisions, often leading to deviations from traditional economic theories. Experiments show that human choices frequently contradict expected utility theory.

# Key Behavioral Phenomena:

1. **Framing Effect:** Decisions are influenced by how choices are presented.
2. **Overconfidence/Conservatism:** Overestimating one’s abilities or sticking rigidly to initial beliefs.
3. **Regret Aversion:** Avoiding decisions that could lead to regret.
4. **Ambiguity Aversion:** Preferring known risks over uncertain outcomes.

# Illustrative Example:

Consider two approaches to combat a disease expected to kill 3,000 people:

* **Choice Pair 1:**
   * Option A: 1,000 people will be saved.
   * Option B: 1/3 probability of saving 3,000 people; 2/3 probability of saving none.
* **Choice Pair 2:**
   * Option A: 2,000 people will die.
   * Option B: 1/3 probability nobody will die; 2/3 probability all 3,000 will die.

Although the outcomes are statistically identical, framing leads to different choices:

* People favor certainty (risk aversion) when gains are framed.
* People take risks (risk-loving behavior) when losses are framed.

# Challenges to Expected Utility Theory (EUT):

1. **Allais Paradox:** Individuals’ choices often contradict EUT predictions.
2. **Certainty Effect:** Preference for guaranteed outcomes over probabilistic ones.

These findings highlight the need for alternative models, as traditional risk aversion and utility assumptions cannot fully explain observed behavior.

# Section 6.5: Introduction to Prospect Theory

**Prospect Theory** offers an alternative to EUT, providing a more realistic framework for understanding decision-making under uncertainty. Developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), it incorporates psychological insights into a mathematical model.

# Key Assumptions of Prospect Theory:

1. **Reference Point:** Decisions are based on changes in wealth relative to a reference point, rather than absolute wealth levels.
2. **S-Shaped Value Function:**
   * Concave for gains (risk aversion).
   * Convex for losses (risk-seeking behavior).
   * Steeper for losses than gains (loss aversion).
3. **Probability Weighting:**
   * Overestimation of small probabilities.
   * Preference for certainty.

# Illustrations:

1. **Value Function:**
   * Depicts diminishing sensitivity for gains and losses.
2. **Probability Weighting Function:**
   * Overweighs small probabilities, underweighs moderate-to-large probabilities.

# Implications:

Prospect theory explains:

* Why do people prefer certainty in gains but take risks in losses.
* Why do lottery tickets (small probabilities of large gains) and insurance (certainty of small losses) appeal to individuals?

# Conclusion

Market efficiency and behavioral finance provide complementary perspectives on financial decision-making. While EMH assumes rationality and perfect information, behavioral finance acknowledges human biases and psychological influences. Prospect theory bridges the gap, offering a robust framework to model real-world decision-making. Together, these theories deepen our understanding of financial markets and investor behavior.

# What is the ""Crash Course in Bonds and Debt - Matan Feldman""?

Let’s talk bonds! If you’ve ever tried to wrap your head around the bond market and felt like you were swimming in an ocean of jargon, you’re not alone. The **""Crash Course in Bonds and Debt - Matan Feldman""** promises to change all that. This course dives deep into fixed income analysis and simplifies the complexities of bonds, making them accessible even if you’re new to the game. It’s all about demystifying concepts like yield curves, bond pricing, and credit analysis.

# Why Should You Care About This Course?

Why this course? Because bond analysis is, let’s face it, usually a pain to learn. Textbooks can be dry, and CFA prep can feel like pulling teeth. This course flips the script with a fresh, engaging approach. Instead of bogging you down with theoretical fluff, it focuses on practical, real-world insights. Whether you’re eyeing a career in investment banking, sales, or trading—or just want to sound smarter at parties—this course has you covered.

# Who Should Enroll in This Course?

Who is this for? Honestly, anyone who wants to truly understand bonds without pulling their hair out. Finance students, CFA candidates, or professionals looking to upskill will all find value here. If you’ve ever thought, *“Convexity? Sounds like a spell from Harry Potter,”* this course will make sure you finally get it.

# Where Can You Use These Skills?

The skills taught in the **""Crash Course in Bonds and Debt - Matan Feldman""** are immediately applicable in the financial world. From pricing bonds on Excel to decoding Bloomberg screens, you’ll learn how the pros operate in fixed income research, trading, and beyond. Whether you’re on Wall Street or climbing the corporate ladder elsewhere, these are tools you can take straight to the bank (pun intended).

# When Can You Start?

The course is self-paced, so you can dive in whenever it suits you. You’ll get access to detailed video lessons, Excel exercises, and a certification exam that validates your bond mastery. Oh, and you have 24 months to take the certification exam—plenty of time to feel fully prepped.

# How Does It Work?

This course is structured into 13 bite-sized chapters, each tackling a crucial aspect of bond analysis. You’ll start with the basics—like what the bond market even is—and move through more advanced topics like Z-spreads, callable bonds, and interest rate risk. Real-world examples and hands-on exercises ensure you’re not just memorizing; you’re *actually* learning.

# What Makes It Stand Out?

Here’s the kicker: this course is **designed for how finance is done today**. From leveraging Excel’s RATE() function to interpreting Bloomberg screens, it bridges the gap between theory and practice. Plus, the promise of a certification exam that’s tough but fair means you’ll walk away with a credential to show off.

# Final Thoughts

The **""Crash Course in Bonds and Debt - Matan Feldman""** is more than just a course; it’s a gateway to mastering one of the trickiest corners of finance. It’s perfect for anyone ready to demystify bonds and take their financial knowledge to the next level. Ready to jump in? Your future in fixed income awaits!"

Need to 3x my money in order to avoid financial doom before the end of Januari and with the bull season going i figured i'd have better chances then playing roulette. Bullish or retarded?,WallStreetBetsCrypto,1ha48a5,2024-12-09 02:10:51,11,0.77,47,https://i.redd.it/t1lsenr7wr5e1.png,bobbabas,Discussion,"
What are my chances of succeeding my goal and riding the bullwave to high heavens? What are my chances im living in my car next month? I have absolutely no clue about crypto so any feedback is welcome. I know bitcoin is a better investment but theres no way its going to help me out in a pinch. I need the money in a few months or weeks, not three years from now.

Besides, this is more fun then going to a casino."
