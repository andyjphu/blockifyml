"Not new to crypto, but relatively new to USDC on polygon and ETH",polygonnetwork,1i9tsad,2025-01-25 13:43:35,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/polygonnetwork/comments/1i9tsad/not_new_to_crypto_but_relatively_new_to_usdc_on/,MPH2025,,"I made the mistake of sending some USDC to my BitPay wallet on the polygon network, in what‚Äôs called an EVM wallet, and it‚Äôs seemingly impossible to get it out because it seems impossible to send polygon for gas, on the polygon network to the wallet where the USDC resides.

I can‚Äôt imagine BitPay would make such a huge mistake as to allow this if it were impossible to get it out. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. 

Even if I click directly on the polygon wallet, and generate a deposit address, anything I send to the address seems to default to the ETH chain, and when I try to send the USDC out, it says I don‚Äôt have enough MATIC to pay for it.

Grrrrr

 Am I screwed here?"

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1i81g9u,2025-01-23 06:39:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1i81g9u/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."

Sorry for this. Coming back after a long long time (last time I bought or logged into crypto was in 2021), but I had bought a lot of MATIC and just let it sit. I still have all my phrases and what not, but I log back in to Metamask today and can‚Äôt find my holdings.

I remember back in 2021 when I was nearing the end, I staked it all using the polygon web wallet app on my windows computer, but when I try to log back into it, it directs me to polygon portal, and I can‚Äôt find the matic I staked. It also looks like transaction history only goes back to 1/1/24 on polygon portal. Anyone know what I need to do to get back to where I was? I was actually able to find the transaction hash on etherscan, but I can‚Äôt figure out what it all means. Sorry if this is too amorphous of a breakdown, I‚Äôm just lost and feeling like I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know anymore.

"Bitcoin Surges Above $100k, Ripple (XRP) Climbs Above $3 As Market Turns Green",CryptoCoinsIndia,1i4o5pz,2025-01-18 21:37:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCoinsIndia/comments/1i4o5pz/bitcoin_surges_above_100k_ripple_xrp_climbs_above/,BraveCryptotab,,"Bitcoin briefly surged past the $100,000 mark on Wednesday, rising as much as 4% before falling back below this key level. As of the latest data, Bitcoin is trading at $99,400, reflecting a 2.5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

https://preview.redd.it/hnr9j6yu4vde1.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3dffde16cc2f2560bf2f7f317b4870eac288af6

Despite these gains, on-chain Bitcoin transactions have dropped by 37% compared to last week‚Äôs peak, which raises concerns about potential downside risks. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs experienced $209 million in outflows, dampening some of the bullish sentiment.

**Altcoin Market Outperforms Bitcoin** While Bitcoin‚Äôs rally was notable, the broader altcoin market outpaced it, posting an 8.61% surge. Among altcoins, Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) saw significant gains, climbing 12% and 14%, respectively. Ripple‚Äôs price revisited the $3 mark, driven by renewed speculation about the role of blockchain in financial innovation under the Trump administration.

Stellar‚Äôs performance closely mirrored that of XRP, as both cryptocurrencies focus on cross-border payments, which helped boost their prices. Solana (SOL) also gained attention, rising by 9% to $205, fueled by increased on-chain activity and the adoption of AI-powered projects within its ecosystem. Polygon (MATIC) saw a 5% rise, reaching $0.48, supported by growing demand for Layer-2 scalability solutions. Analysts speculate that MATIC may break the $0.50 resistance if the current momentum continues.

With optimism continuing to grow in the market, experts predict that XRP could retest the $3 level, while XLM might target $0.60 as altcoins gain more traction.

**Bitcoin Could Surpass $300,000 in 2025** According to a market survey by HashKey Group, Bitcoin could potentially surpass $300,000 in 2025. The Hong Kong-based digital asset firm attributes this potential surge to rising institutional capital inflows and increasing adoption by mainstream financial institutions.

The survey, which was conducted among nearly 50,000 community members, highlights Wall Street‚Äôs growing interest in cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions are expanding their crypto services, signaling greater acceptance of digital assets. HashKey Group‚Äôs Chairman, Dr. Xiao Feng, emphasized the market's potential for ""extraordinary growth.""

The firm also predicts that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization could reach $10 trillion by the end of 2025, a significant increase from its current $3.64 trillion, as per CoinGecko. Bitcoin‚Äôs role as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù remains central to this bullish outlook, particularly as the asset recently surpassed the $100,000 level amid inflation concerns and macroeconomic updates, despite institutional outflows.

Additionally, HashKey anticipates that Ethereum will adopt the ‚Äúdigital oil‚Äù narrative, with its price possibly hitting $8,000 by year‚Äôs end. The report also highlights the expected injection of $3 trillion in new capital into the market through innovations such as Security Token Offerings, ETFs, and Central Bank Digital Currencies.

Institutional confidence in crypto has grown significantly, especially following the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and initiatives like MicroStrategy‚Äôs corporate treasury diversification. On a global scale, some countries are even considering Bitcoin as part of their national reserves, further supporting the positive outlook for the asset.

In the U.S., states like New Hampshire and North Dakota have proposed legislation to establish Bitcoin reserves, following Ohio‚Äôs earlier attempt to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. This trend reflects a growing interest among U.S. states to diversify their treasuries with cryptocurrency."

In Dec 2023, I tried to transfer $2000 MATIC via Polygon network to Coinbase, but if failed. I contacted coinbase customer support at that time, they said the reason is because Polygon network is not supported by Coinbase, the fund will be automatically credited to me as soon as Coinbase supports it.

  
Recently, I saw the coinbase does support Polygon. On Coinbase's website, it said that ""Starting September 10, 2024, Coinbase will replace the MATIC asset ticker for the Polygon network with POL. "" . Details here: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/polygon-migration](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/polygon-migration)

But I still did not receive the fund. I also tried to use the asset recovery tool on coinbase website, I confirmed all information are correct, but it kept showing error message ""You don't have access to this transaction and asked me to contact customer support"".

  
 I contacted Coinbase Customer support (it literally took me almost 5 hours to just get in touch with their customer support - both calls and live chat, which is crazyüò≠Ôºâ...The agent just said the same thing - please try to use the recovery tool, but I have tried multiple times alreadyüò≠ I feel like we are in a circle, going back and forth...

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1i2n1dq,2025-01-16 06:39:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1i2n1dq/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."

",DAOLabs,1i1f1ud,2025-01-14 15:02:45,9,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1i1f1ud/polygon_community_grants_program_season_2_begins/,TheDAOLabs, News/ Articles,"Polygon is starting the second season of the Community Grants Program with 35 million POL dedicated to ecosystem development. This program extends opportunities for builders and innovators by providing funding through numerous tracks. Although ordinary applications are accepted yearly, starting from January 14 to April 15, it is a perfect time for projects to apply for grants and help strengthen Polygon‚Äôs ecosystem.



The Direct Grants Track is a notable component, intended for builders in all classifications, and I will discuss it in the next section. Here, the quality takes precedent over the theme and MATIC enthusiasts can earn up to 20 million POL for projects that can bolster Polygon‚Äôs ecosystem. In parallel, specific Grant Allocator Tracks provide 15 million POL with independent allocators on essential topics, such as AI, DePIN, and memecoins.



It shows that Polygon is ready to promote innovation and collaboration and also become an active member ofthe  Web3 community. In this respect, DAO Labs‚Äô Polygon Hub fits perfectly with this mission and connects with the community through Social Mining. It permits builders and participants to learn about updates and developments within CGP, express their views and ideas, and generally participate in discussions about ecosystem development, which is an essential basis for the growth model‚Äôs transparency and inclusiveness.



As the application window continues, the CGP emphasizes that Polygon helps implement progressive initiatives consistent with its fully decentralized approach.

But what exactly is Polygon, and why should we care? ü§î  
Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum designed to enhance its transaction speed and reduce costs. Did you know that Polygon can process up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single sidechain? Compare that to Ethereum's 15 transactions per second, and you start to see the potential! üìà  
But it's not just about speed. Polygon supports various types of blockchain networks, allowing developers to create scalable and user-friendly dApps (decentralized applications) without the high gas fees that plague Ethereum. This opens the door for mass adoption and brings in developers and users who might have been hesitant before.   
Here's where I want to hear from you, Reddit! üåü Do you think Polygon could become the dominant layer 2 solution for Ethereum? Or will another competitor like Optimism or Arbitrum steal the spotlight?

If an avatar is posted on OpenSea, it's listed at the value of the crypto it is posted for (Normally Polygon/Matic or ETH/WETH), not dollar amount. So, if it was posted a week ago and was listed at $50, it may now be listed for $30. (Literally. I posted my Campanile a few days ago for $700 something and the drop in values put it at $600 something. It's a drop of 6% from last week. ETH was $3714 3 days ago, now it's $3301. This isn't an advert, I've already been undercut - just too lazy to repost it.)

No one knows how long everything will stay down, but I just wanted to give a heads up. If you have stuff listed and the dollar amount matters to you, you should probably double check that.

Just wanted to give a heads up. Happy Mashing!

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1hxaxjb,2025-01-09 06:39:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1hxaxjb/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium.

Crypto Markets in the New Year: A Promising Start or a Rocky Road?,TradingElite,1hx90ky,2025-01-09 04:19:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1hx90ky/crypto_markets_in_the_new_year_a_promising_start/,Maylights,,"The start of a new year often brings renewed optimism and fresh opportunities in the crypto world. Traders and investors alike reflect on the past year's highs and lows, eager to decipher the trends and events that will shape the months ahead. The opening weeks of 2024 have already hinted at key developments in the cryptocurrency space, with price volatility, regulatory discussions, and technological advancements driving market sentiment.

**Early Movements: Major Cryptocurrencies**

1. Bitcoin (BTC): Steady but WatchfulBitcoin began the year with cautious optimism, hovering around key resistance levels. Its price movements have been shaped by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation trends and central bank policies. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with new investment products and adoption among traditional financial institutions.
2. Ethereum (ETH): Eyes on UpgradesEthereum started the year with attention focused on its roadmap for network upgrades. Following the success of the Merge and Shanghai updates, investors are keen on Ethereum's scalability and the growing dominance of decentralized applications (dApps) in sectors like gaming and finance.
3. Altcoins and the Rise of Utility TokensAltcoins like Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Chainlink (LINK) have seen mixed performance, with investors prioritizing tokens that offer real-world utility. The growing adoption of blockchain for supply chain management, healthcare, and entertainment has increased demand for these coins.

**Market Sentiment: Optimism Meets Caution**

The opening of 2024 has brought a mix of optimism and caution. While the crypto community remains hopeful for a bull run, concerns about regulatory crackdowns, especially in major markets like the U.S. and Europe, persist. Recent developments in crypto taxation and compliance have added a layer of complexity to the trading environment.

**The Role of Innovation**

The crypto space continues to innovate, with developments in areas such as:

\- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): New DeFi platforms are emerging, offering higher yields and innovative staking mechanisms.

\- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs are moving beyond art into gaming, ticketing, and brand engagement, creating diverse revenue streams.

\- Layer-2 Solutions: Technologies like Optimism and Arbitrum are gaining traction, reducing transaction costs and improving scalability on the Ethereum network.

**Geopolitical and Economic Factors**

The global economic environment plays a crucial role in shaping crypto markets. Inflation concerns, energy prices, and geopolitical tensions continue to influence investor behavior. Meanwhile, the growing interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) highlights the intersection of traditional finance and crypto innovation.

**Tools and Platforms in Focus**

For traders and analysts, platforms like [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) remain indispensable. With its advanced charting tools, customizable indicators, and a vibrant community of crypto enthusiasts, TradingView helps users navigate the complexities of the crypto market. Whether identifying breakout patterns or sharing insights, it has become a go-to resource for many.

**Predictions for the Year Ahead**

1. Regulatory DevelopmentsGovernments and financial watchdogs are expected to ramp up efforts to regulate the crypto industry. While this may cause short-term volatility, clear regulations could foster long-term growth by increasing investor confidence.
2. Institutional AdoptionThe entrance of institutional investors continues to reshape the market. From ETFs to custody solutions, traditional finance is becoming more intertwined with crypto.
3. Technological BreakthroughsInnovations in blockchain technology, including zero-knowledge proofs and quantum resistance, are likely to redefine security and scalability.
4. Emerging MarketsDeveloping countries are increasingly adopting crypto for remittances and financial inclusion. This trend is expected to accelerate, especially in regions with unstable fiat currencies.

**Final Thoughts**

The new trading year has started with a blend of excitement and uncertainty for the crypto market. As the industry continues to evolve, staying informed and adaptable is key. Leveraging tools like [TradingView Premium Free](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/), keeping an eye on global developments, and focusing on projects with strong fundamentals can help traders and investors navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities that 2024 promises to bring."

* This graph showcases the share price of Coinbase, one of the biggest crypto related businesses and a benchmark for analyzing ‚Äúbig money‚Äù in crypto + related to today‚Äôs news!

**Ethereum and Layer 2 Highlights**

**Ethereum Mainnet**

* **Coinbase vs SEC Lawsuit Paused**: A U.S. judge agreed to let Coinbase appeal an important decision in its case with the SEC, putting the case on hold for now. The appeal will focus on whether the crypto assets involved count as ""investment contracts"" under securities laws. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, accusing it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency - likely, this will be an important case for the future of centralized exchanges.
* **AAVE Celebrates 5 Years**: Aave, the leading lending protocol, turned five today. Well, most likely yesterday depending on when you‚Äôre reading. Launched on January 8, 2020, it helped start DeFi Summer and grew into the biggest DeFi platform, with over $34 billion in total value locked, 13 markets, and 2.3 million users across 11 networks. Aave is now preparing to launch Aave V4 later this year.

**Arbitrum**

* **Lotte Group Partnership**: South Korea's Lotte Group has chosen Arbitrum's blockchain to develop its Lotte Caliverse, aiming to enhance Web3 entertainment experiences. Let‚Äôs see how this will pan out for the growing web3 gaming market.

**Optimism**

* **OP Price Update**: Optimism's token, OP, is trading around $2.12, with recent price fluctuations between $2.06 and $2.18. It looks like it won‚Äôt break out of here anytime soon.

**Polygon**

* **Kraken's Layer 2 Solution**: In October 2024, Kraken announced 'Ink,' a new Ethereum Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain, with its testnet expected to go live soon.
* **DIA's Lumina Testnet**: In November 2024, DIA launched the testnet for Lumina, a modular oracle designed to enhance transparency and integration, utilizing an OP stack-based Optimism solution.

Both of these products are expected to go out soon, so let‚Äôs keep an eye on them!

**Project of the Day**

**Project of the Day: Auditchain's** [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai)

**Overview:** Auditchain has rolled out [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai), a cutting-edge decentralized platform that merges blockchain and AI to elevate financial, sustainability, and crypto asset disclosures. It‚Äôs built to provide real-time validation of financial statements and control sets, introducing a fresh era of continuous auditing. This project is geared toward tackling the pain points of traditional financial reporting by integrating transparency and trust into the system.

**Significance:**

* **Regulatory Compliance:** [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) is designed to help organizations navigate the complexities of regulatory reporting with precision. This, obviously, boosts reliability in financial disclosures.
* **Support for Traditional Formats:** The platform supports machine-readable formats like XBRL and JSON, meaning it‚Äôll be useable by most traditional accountants.
* **Incentivized Ecosystem:** With a built-in payment and rewards system using USDC, [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) incentivizes users to contribute to high-quality control sets, making the ecosystem collaborative and self-sustaining.

**Recent Update:** As of 2024, Auditchain deployed [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) on the mainnet, marking a milestone as the first blockchain-based **Regulatory Finance (RegFi)** protocol. This move bridges the gap between traditional financial frameworks and decentralized technologies, bringing millions of annual disclosures on-chain and setting a new standard for automated compliance.

\[TLDR because I made it quite blocky and long - it‚Äôs a super good product for finance professionals who want to get into blockchain.\]

**Key Takeaways**

**Ethereum Ecosystem**

* **Regulatory Landscape:** The approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a significant political issue. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin anticipates that several Ether ETF applications will receive approval, though he expects a lengthy wait before they become public. This development underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets - while multiple ETH ETFs have been launched yet, there‚Äôs still quite a few to go.
* **Research and Development:** In a notable development, Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer following a controversy. This event highlights the let‚Äôs say dynamic nature of the Ethereum development community and the challenges it faces in governance and collaboration\*\*.\*\*¬†

**Layer 2 Narrative**

* **Berachain's Unique Consensus:** Berachain is introducing Proof of Liquidity to enhance Ethereum‚Äôs scalability while maintaining decentralization and reducing energy consumption. This modern, fairly innovative approach targets both Ethereum‚Äôs transaction throughput and environmental concerns.
* **Ink Chain Mainnet Launch:** Built on the Optimism Superchain (which we‚Äôve covered before!), Ink Chain launched its mainnet ahead of schedule, marking a significant milestone for their future ecosystem
* **Airdrop Anticipation:** Upcoming Berachain and Linea Protocol airdrops are sparking excitement in the community, with both projects contributing to the growing innovation (though also to the complexity) of Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum. These airdrops will obviously increase user engagement and strengthen their respective ecosystems. Which is good.

**Quick Stats**

* **Ethereum (ETH)** Price: $3,698.19 Total Value Locked (TVL): $71.533 billion
* **Arbitrum (ARB)** Price: $0.9196 TVL: $3.234 billion Daily Transactions: \~1.2 million

I kept missing important crypto news because I was too lazy to check multiple sites, so I built a little weekend project that pulls news from different sources into one place. Added AI summaries to help quickly scan articles and included active crypto streams since I watch those too.

The first time you request an article summary it takes a few seconds (AI, you know), but after that it's cached and instant. Nothing fancy overall, but it helps me stay on top of things. Would love to hear if anyone else finds this useful and what features you'd want to see!

Introducing the Arcana Chain Abstraction SDK: Pioneering a New Era of Web3 Development,Crypto_General,1htoygx,2025-01-04 16:30:04,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1htoygx/introducing_the_arcana_chain_abstraction_sdk/,Jhayle08,Daily Discussion,"

The blockchain ecosystem has undergone immense growth over the past few years, with the emergence of dozens of Layer 1 blockchains, Layer 2 scaling solutions, sidechains, and rollups. However, this rapid expansion has introduced a significant challenge: fragmentation. Navigating the multi-chain world is cumbersome for both developers and users. Developers face complex technical hurdles in supporting multiple blockchains, while users grapple with the friction of swapping, bridging, and managing gas fees. Arcana‚Äôs Chain Abstraction SDK is designed to address these challenges, providing a unified framework that simplifies cross-chain development and enhances the user experience.

# Unifying the Fragmented Blockchain Ecosystem

One of the most significant barriers to blockchain adoption is the fragmented nature of the ecosystem. Each chain operates in isolation, often requiring specialized tooling, custom integrations, and unique user interactions. Arcana‚Äôs Chain Abstraction SDK bridges these gaps, creating a cohesive layer that connects multiple chains seamlessly.

For users, this means no more juggling between wallets or manually bridging assets. For developers, it eliminates the need for multi-chain support to be baked into their codebase. Instead, they can focus on building powerful, innovative applications while relying on Arcana to handle the complexities of blockchain interoperability.

# Simplifying the Multi-Chain User Experience

With Arcana‚Äôs Chain Abstraction SDK, developers can provide a streamlined, intuitive experience to their users. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Unified Asset Balances**: Users connect their existing wallets, such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or others, to the application. Once connected, they‚Äôll see a unified balance of their assets across all supported chains. Whether it‚Äôs ETH, USDT, USDC, or other supported tokens, these balances are aggregated and displayed in a single view.
2. **Seamless Spending Across Chains**: Users can spend their assets on the app‚Äôs native chain without needing to perform any swapping, bridging, or refueling of gas. This removes the typical multi-chain complexities and allows users to interact with dApps effortlessly.
3. **Gas Fees Paid in Stablecoins**: Unlike traditional setups where users must hold native tokens (e.g., ETH for Ethereum or MATIC for Polygon) to pay for gas, Arcana‚Äôs SDK allows gas fees to be paid in stablecoins like USDC or USDT. This reduces friction and ensures a more predictable user experience.
4. **Faster Transactions**: Thanks to Arcana‚Äôs modular Layer 1 architecture and intent-solver network, transactions are executed in under 20 seconds. Users no longer need to wait for lengthy confirmations, further improving the usability of blockchain applications.

# Empowering Developers with Simplified Integration

Developers often face significant challenges when building for a multi-chain environment. Supporting multiple blockchains typically requires:

* Developing chain-specific smart contracts.
* Managing cross-chain interoperability.
* Migrating or upgrading contracts to support new chains.

Arcana‚Äôs SDK eliminates these complexities. It can be integrated into existing applications with minimal changes to front-end code. There‚Äôs no need for extensive contract migrations or upgrades. By providing a single, unified SDK, Arcana enables developers to focus on creating exceptional user experiences and innovative features rather than wrestling with the intricacies of blockchain infrastructure.

# Flexible and Customizable for Any Application

Arcana‚Äôs SDK is designed to be flexible and adaptable. Developers can customize the unified balance display to align with their app‚Äôs specific user interface and experience. Whether it‚Äôs a DeFi platform, a gaming dApp, or a marketplace, the SDK integrates seamlessly to enhance the app‚Äôs functionality.

Moreover, the SDK ensures there‚Äôs no vendor lock-in. Users retain full custody of their assets, interacting directly with the blockchain through their wallets. This design philosophy aligns with the core principles of Web3, ensuring transparency, decentralization, and user empowerment.

# Real-World Use Cases Highlighted by the Demo App

The power of Arcana‚Äôs Chain Abstraction SDK is best illustrated through its demo application. The app showcases the SDK‚Äôs capabilities, including:

* **Cross-Chain Balance Consolidation**: Users can consolidate their balances across multiple chains into a single, unified view. This feature simplifies asset management and gives users complete visibility of their holdings.
* **Multi-Chain Transfers Made Easy**: Sending assets across chains is no longer a daunting task. For instance, a user wanting to send 15 USDC to an address on Arbitrum simply needs to specify the amount and approve the transaction. The SDK orchestrates the transfer, consolidating assets from different chains and automatically calculating the necessary fees.

These capabilities demonstrate the practical benefits of the SDK, showcasing how it reduces friction and simplifies multi-chain interactions for both developers and users.

# Current and Future Chain Support

At launch, the Arcana Chain Abstraction SDK supports popular blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. These chains represent some of the most widely used networks in the Web3 space, ensuring that developers can cater to a broad audience.

Looking ahead, Arcana plans to expand support to additional chains and assets. This commitment to scalability ensures that the SDK remains relevant as the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve.

Top 10 Blockchains (2024) by Network Activity,CapitalistExploits,1htm7y6,2025-01-04 14:30:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1htm7y6/top_10_blockchains_2024_by_network_activity/,kayakero,,"Blockchain technology continues to evolve constantly, and user activity is one of the most reliable indicators of its success.

An good method for evaluating this interaction is the number of daily active addresses, which measures how many unique addresses perform transactions in a day.

# Top blockchains of 2024

On December 27, 2024, CryptoRank published a ranking of the top 10 blockchains of the year based on this criterion. Here are the highlights:

# NEAR Protocol

NEAR Protocol leads the ranking with 2.7 million daily active addresses. This represents a 766% growth compared to the previous year. The blockchain stands out for its Nightshade¬†*sharding*¬†technology , which enables high transaction capacity at low costs.

Decentralized applications (¬†*dApps*¬†) focused on gaming and social networking drove adoption, attracting both developers and new users to the ecosystem.

# Solana

Solana ranks second with 2.6 million daily active addresses, a 702% growth in active addresses.

This performance is related to its vibrant¬†*memecoin*¬†ecosystem and fast and accessible infrastructure, which attracted DeFi and NFT projects. Platforms such as [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun) played a crucial role in increasing interaction on the network.

# TRON

TRON is in third place, growing by 20.3% in 2024, with 1.9 million daily active addresses. Its efficiency in¬†*stablecoin*¬†transactions , especially with Tether (USDT), has consolidated its popularity.

Additionally, TRON remained relevant in the DeFi sector, with global partnerships ensuring fast and low-cost transactions.

# Other blockchains in the top 10

* **BNB Chain**: 1 million daily active addresses, down slightly by 4.8%;
* **Polygon (MATIC)**: 855K active addresses, growing 139%. Stands out in gaming, NFTs, and DeFi;
* **Base**: 655K active addresses (+2,098%), benefiting from the integration with Coinbase;
* **Sui**: 519K active addresses (+908%), powered by an innovative programming language;
* **Bitcoin**: 496K active addresses, down 19%;
* **The Open Network (TON)**: 414K active addresses (+5,185%), driven by Telegram integration;
* **Arbitrum**: 413 thousand active addresses (+180%), standing out as Ethereum's Layer 2 solution.

Another method for evaluating blockchain success is Total Value Locked (TVL), which measures the dollar value of assets locked in DeFi protocols. Ethereum dominates with 56.22% of global TVL, but does not lead in daily active addresses, highlighting the diversity of strengths across networks.

On the other hand, Solana and TRON, which lead in user activity, have a lower TVL share, reflecting their interaction with smaller transactions and higher volume.

"[Presentation] Coinfetes (COF): A simple project that started with literally zero tokens, but was born mineable!",u_jeffreinholds,1hs2bh1,2025-01-02 14:39:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jeffreinholds/comments/1hs2bh1/presentation_coinfetes_cof_a_simple_project_that/,jeffreinholds,,"Hi guys! I'm Jeff Reinholds, a Brazilian journalist, crypto fan and creator of COF (Coinfetes). First of all, I want to make it clear: this is no longer a ‚Äúpromise‚Äù project. COF already exists, is already being mined (even if only by me ahaha), and is already listed on Uniswap.

*But let me explain how we got here and why I believe COF could be an interesting idea...*

**What is COF?**

Coinfetes (COF) is a cryptocurrency designed to be accessible, transparent and fully minable, directly through the browser, even by those who are not yet crypto enthusiasts. It works on the Polygon network, guaranteeing low fees and fast transactions.

The main idea is simple: to value the act of mining and, consequently, the token: the more people who mine, the more expensive it is to mine, and this reflects directly on the perceived value of the token.

**How does mining work?**

Connect your wallet to the Polygon network. Click on the mining button. You receive 1 COF for each mine.

üí° **Initial cost:** the COF started at 0.001 MATIC, check it out! üìà Automatic increase: With each mining, the cost goes up by 0.001 MATIC.

*Why this model? I wanted something simple, but with purpose:*

**Affordable start:** Everyone can get started with minimal fees. Organic growth: The rising cost reflects the appreciation of the COF. Sustainability: The fees collected finance the project, such as listings on DEX/CEX.

Is the COF already in circulation? Yes, and that's the exciting thing!

***The first 30 COF mined:*** *I mined it myself and used the MATIC accumulated in the contract (which I paid to mine) to create a pair on Uniswap.*

**Verified contract:** You can check everything on PolygonScan: [https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8FF29eD6c04aE42057C5eeEFb5231B07766d07ea](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8FF29eD6c04aE42057C5eeEFb5231B07766d07ea)

**The contract code is public**: [https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8FF29eD6c04aE42057C5eeEFb5231B07766d07ea#code](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8FF29eD6c04aE42057C5eeEFb5231B07766d07ea#code)

**Why trust?**

I know the community is (and should be!) suspicious. I'm a journalist used to the lies of politicians and businessmen, so by nature I don't trust anyone at first (and sometimes not even the second, third, fourth...) So I'll get straight to the point:

Nothing hidden: The contract is public and verified on PolygonScan, check it out for yourself! Transparency: All proceeds from COF mining in MATIC go to finance the project, I've already used the balance generated by myself to list it on DEX. Organic start: No premining, ICO or ‚Äúhidden reserves‚Äù, not even I have COF if I don't mine!

*The project team? For now, it's just me with the valuable help of ChatGPT, who helped me with ideas and even code! Thank you very much Chat!!!!*

Ah, but this methodology of increasing the rate by 0.001 MATIC for each new COF mined is insane and will become unsustainable...

Fine, then you buy COF in a DEX or CEX instead of mining, simple as that!

**Want to know more?**

‚úâÔ∏è **Contact:** cof(at)coinfetes.com

ü§ù **Come and mine**: The process is super simple and it's already working.

If you have any questions or suggestions, I'm here for you! I want to build something transparent and that makes sense for the community.

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1hrru72,2025-01-02 06:39:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1hrru72/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."
Which Cryptocurrency is Promising Right Now?,TradingElite,1hr7gdx,2025-01-01 12:21:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1hr7gdx/which_cryptocurrency_is_promising_right_now/,Maylights,,"# The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and dynamic nature, making it essential to stay informed about promising projects.

Are We Being Manipulated? Is Polygon (Previously MATIC) a Good Long Term Investment?,ethtrader,1hott29,2024-12-29 06:01:39,14,0.86,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hott29/are_we_being_manipulated_is_polygon_previously/,kirtash93,Original Content,"The other day I saw this [tweet](https://x.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1872586769520345198) about Polygon super users base and how Polygon still remains as the most trusted chain in ETH scaling solutions for people that usually makes on chain transactions and it made me think about it.

[Yearly Super Users Polygon vs Base](https://preview.redd.it/nh17plt9dr9e1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cf5620e814cf0d765d1495711b16c530c9ac713)

In the image above we can see how Polygon super users has grown this year by 600K to 2.1M having 1.2M more than Base, currently the biggest competence.

As you know mainstream media always keeps pushing narratives they have convenience to push or are paid to push and this way they try manipulate the sentiment of the investors and move it towards to other tokens. Even if we are smart, it is inevitable to be affected in this war of attrition they play and due to the fact that POL price is not in a great place right now competence took advantage of this. I am not saying that the rest of the projects are bad or manipulating but it came to my attention how Polygon articles dumped while others raised. And this is happening even if a very important upgrade (AggLayer) is coming to POL soon which I believe will be a game changer.

# What makes POL a good investment?

* Time in the market: Polygon has been in the market since 2017 and survived 2 winters and the typical problems you can experience during a project growth. This is what increases POL resiliency while some of the competence tokens even if they can be great and do an amazing job still don't have because they are young.
* There are several important projects built to support Polygon like Polymarket (which makes a lot of noise sometimes), OpenSea, etc.
* It has a big base of active users acquired because of time in the market + a lot of utilities already built on it.
* Interesting collaborations with Nike, Disney, Stripe, etc. showing that big companies are willing to work on it.
* Polygon has released upgrades and maintained them without having frequent outages.
* AggLayer game changer upgrade is coming soon making so smooth to combine different L2s technologies like zk-rollups, optimistic rollups, sidechains, etc. into a unified infrastructure making communication a LOT more easier.

Unfortunately not everything is perfect and lately POL has been into some arguments regarding using a treasury funds for the rewards system, etc. This could be considered the usual arguments or problems in a project evolution. The key in this kind of things is to check how the argument has been developed. Things like, the team, CEO or whoever are acting like dictators or idiots?

Also the price is not helping to show off the potential of POL but as I believe, price most of the times don't follow and those moments are when investors need to analyze and decide if its time to jump in.

From my point of view, POL is a great long term investment just because of time in the market, how things have evolved since then and the incoming upgrades that are going to be a game changer for POL. I also heard rumors regarding a possible upgrade evolving to a native ETH L2s instead of being a sidechain. Both options have their pros and cons.

Cryptocurrencies with the Best Future Prospects and Lowest Transaction Fees,TradingElite,1ho8ony,2024-12-28 11:05:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1ho8ony/cryptocurrencies_with_the_best_future_prospects/,Maylights,,"The cryptocurrency market is growing rapidly, with thousands of digital assets being traded worldwide. As blockchain technology matures, the focus of investors is shifting toward cryptocurrencies that offer scalability, real-world utility, and low transaction fees. These factors are key for long-term success in a space where high transaction costs can inhibit the adoption of digital currencies. In this article, we will explore some of the most promising cryptocurrencies with the lowest transaction fees, offering excellent future potential for investors, businesses, and users.

**Why Low Transaction Fees Matter**

In the world of cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are essential for ensuring efficient network operations. However, high fees can deter users from adopting or utilizing digital currencies for everyday transactions. When network congestion increases, so do transaction fees. This is particularly evident in Bitcoin and Ethereum, where fees can become prohibitively high during periods of heavy use.

Low transaction fees are essential for making cryptocurrencies more accessible and practical for microtransactions, business payments, and global remittances. As the crypto industry evolves, many blockchain projects are focusing on reducing fees while increasing transaction speed, scalability, and security. Below are some of the most promising cryptocurrencies that not only have the potential for significant future growth but also feature low transaction fees.

**1. Stellar (XLM) ‚Äì Fast, Low-Cost Cross-Border Payments**

Stellar (XLM) is a blockchain platform designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments. The network aims to bridge the gap between traditional financial institutions and digital currencies by providing a decentralized platform for transferring money globally at low fees.

Why Stellar Has Great Prospects:

\- Stellar‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low, typically around 0.00001 XLM per transaction. This makes it ideal for small transactions and remittances.

\- Stellar has partnered with several large financial institutions, including IBM, to create payment networks for businesses and individuals. It aims to offer fast and secure cross-border payments, especially in emerging markets.

\- Stellar is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it a scalable option for international payments.

As global remittance flows continue to rise, Stellar is well-positioned to capture market share due to its low fees and rapid transaction processing.

**2. Nano (NANO) ‚Äì Fee-less and Fast Transactions**

Nano (NANO) is a unique cryptocurrency that prioritizes fast transactions and zero fees. Unlike traditional blockchains, Nano uses a block-lattice structure, where each account has its own blockchain, allowing for instant and free transactions.

Why Nano Has Great Prospects:

\- Nano transactions are completely fee-less, making it one of the most appealing cryptocurrencies for users who want to make fast payments without worrying about high costs.

\- Nano‚Äôs block-lattice structure ensures that transactions are confirmed almost instantaneously, providing an excellent user experience.

\- Unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, Nano uses a unique consensus algorithm called ""Open Representative Voting"" (ORV), which consumes minimal energy and allows for high throughput.

Nano‚Äôs fee-less transactions and environmentally friendly model make it a strong contender for adoption in everyday use cases, such as peer-to-peer payments, microtransactions, and remittances.

**3. Solana (SOL) ‚Äì Fast, Scalable, and Low-Cost Blockchain**

Solana (SOL) has gained significant attention as a high-performance blockchain that can process thousands of transactions per second at low fees. Its high scalability and fast transaction processing make it an attractive option for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi platforms, and NFTs.

Why Solana Has Great Prospects:

\- Solana‚Äôs fees are typically less than $0.01 per transaction, making it much cheaper than Ethereum or Bitcoin.

\- Solana can process over 65,000 transactions per second, which makes it one of the fastest blockchains in terms of throughput.

\- Solana has become a popular platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and NFTs due to its low fees and high-speed transactions.

With its growing ecosystem and increasing adoption, Solana has positioned itself as a major player in the blockchain space, particularly for use cases that require high throughput and low fees.

**4. Polygon (MATIC) ‚Äì Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum**

Polygon (MATIC) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to solve the high transaction fees and slow speeds associated with the Ethereum network. By using a combination of Plasma chains, zk-Rollups, and other technologies, Polygon significantly reduces transaction costs and increases throughput.

\- Ripple has partnered with over 300 financial institutions globally, including Santander, American Express, and PNC, to offer cross-border payment solutions.

\- XRP transactions are confirmed in just a few seconds, making it an ideal solution for international payments.

Ripple‚Äôs adoption by major financial institutions and its ability to facilitate low-cost, fast payments give it strong potential for growth in the coming years.

**7. Algorand (ALGO) ‚Äì Fast and Secure Blockchain with Low Fees**

Algorand (ALGO) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for speed, security, and scalability. Algorand uses a unique consensus mechanism called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS), which allows for fast and secure transactions at very low costs.

Why Algorand Has Great Prospects:

\- Algorand‚Äôs fees are typically around $0.001 per transaction, making it one of the lowest-fee blockchains in the market.

COIN100 (C100): Your All-in-One Crypto Index Fund on Polygon,AllCryptoBets,1hnm2iu,2024-12-27 13:58:39,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1hnm2iu/coin100_c100_your_allinone_crypto_index_fund_on/,zer0h0t,ALTCOIN,"Hello everyone! Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to introduce **COIN100 (C100)**‚Äîa decentralized crypto index fund on the Polygon network that tracks the **top 100 cryptocurrencies** by market cap. If you‚Äôve ever wished you could invest in the entire crypto market with **one** token, this might be your answer.

# What is COIN100 (C100)?

* **Top 100 Index**: Think of it as the crypto equivalent of the S&P 500‚Äîonly for the top 100 digital assets.
* **Rebasing Mechanism**: Every token holder‚Äôs balance automatically adjusts based on the changing market cap of the top 100 cryptos. No complex portfolio management needed.
* **Built on Polygon**: Enjoy low transaction fees and lightning-fast speeds without worrying about the high gas costs you see on other chains.

# Why an Index Fund for Crypto?

* **Diversified Exposure**: Instead of holding multiple tokens, C100 gives you proportional ownership of the entire top 100.
* **Lower Risk, Broad Coverage**: Crypto can be volatile. By spreading out exposure, you reduce single-asset risk.
* **No Active Management**: Let the rebase mechanism do the heavy lifting. Your holdings automatically re-adjust when the overall top 100 market cap changes.
* **Fair for All**: No hidden whales tipping the scales; the supply rebases equally for every holder.

# Key Details for Early Supporters

* **Initial Price**: **0.001** per C100
* **ICO Duration**: 12 months (Starting **January 1, 2025**)
* **Network**: **Polygon (MATIC)**
* **Accepted Tokens**: MATIC, USDC, and other **approved ERC20** tokens
* **Liquidity Rewards**: Earn extra incentives for providing liquidity in our official pools.

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1hmmo5c,2024-12-26 06:39:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1hmmo5c/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."

Poll: Am i right to feel scammed by Coinbase? Would love the community's thoughts.,CoinBase,1hjo61r,2024-12-21 20:25:08,0,0.25,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1hjo61r/poll_am_i_right_to_feel_scammed_by_coinbase_would/,hippocartel,,"On 11/25/24 I sent a test transaction from my metamask to my coinbase account of $10 of USDC via the polygon network. I received my USDC after 1 hour.

Then i sent the full transaction.  Let's just say it was $5000 (roughly this amount) to the exact same address from the exact same address via the polygon network.  I still have not received my USDC today.

On 11/26/24 I sent another test transaction of $1 to the exact same addresses.  I received my USDC after 2 hours.

On 11/28/24 After waiting for a chat agent for 7 hours, i finally get through and they look at the transaction and say.  It's a large amount. It was held up but it will be in your account soon. 

11/29/24 through today (12/21/24) I keep trying to get through to the chat or phone and they say, wait is too long and just kick me out of the queue.  I finally see a message on reddit that says social media is the best way to get in touch.  I reach out via twitter and the agent looks into the issue and says, the address you sent it to only accepts MATIC and does not accept USDC on Polygon. We all know this is obviously not true.  When I look on polyscan, all 3 transactions go through to the same wallet.  Agent says ""your funds cannot be recovered.""

Exact quote for shits and giggles...

""Thanks for sharing additional information. According to our records, it appears that you sent USDC to a Polygon (MATIC) address xxx. This is an address that can only receive Polygon (MATIC).  
In this situation, these USDC funds cannot be recovered. We do not support transactions where one cryptocurrency is sent to the address of a different cryptocurrency nor are we able to reverse the transaction since transactions on the blockchain are irreversible."" 

  
I'm obviously upset but do not take it out on this agent b/c they probably are just following some script.  So now i would love for the community to weigh in and let me know if they would feel scammed if they were in my shoes.  I sent the necessary test transactions before and after but it just so happens that my largest deposit is the one that does not make it through.  I'm really disappointed in this coinbase experience.  I've been using coinbase since 2013.  I'm a crypto native user and never would have thought Coinbase would be the place i lose funds lol

UPDATE: They did not scam me but it did require a month of back and forth. They admitted that the funds should have showed up quickly and apologized that it took so long. They also confirmed i did everything as i should have. I‚Äôm just relieved to get my usdc back.

Looking for Feedback on My Long-Term Crypto Investment Strategy,CryptoMarkets,1hip31h,2024-12-20 12:36:24,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hip31h/looking_for_feedback_on_my_longterm_crypto/,JuWu90,Strategy,"\*\*\* This is all my own research and thoughts but the text is optimized by ChatGPT. Apparently this is important to some people \*\*\*

Hi everyone,

After sitting on the sidelines for far too long, I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to take a more serious approach to cryptocurrency investing. A few years ago, I got involved with too many shitcoins and lost motivation‚Äîunfortunately. I just kept a very small portion of BTC, ETH, and BNB.

Now, I want to make a fresh start. I have some savings in a 3% p.a. savings account that I want to partially invest in crypto. Yes, I admit that I do have some FOMO, but to avoid risking too much at once, I plan to use a hybrid approach of a lump sum investment combined with monthly DCA. With the current dip, I of course want to start as soon as possible.

I‚Äôm not looking for quick wins or risky plays‚ÄîI want to build a long-term portfolio focused on projects with solid fundamentals that I can hold for years.

Here‚Äôs the strategy I‚Äôm planning to implement:

# Monthly Investment Plan:

# Store of Value

* **Bitcoin (BTC):** 35%

# Smart Contracts & dApps

* **Ethereum (ETH):** 30%
* **Binance Coin (BNB):** 10%

# Scalability & Interoperability

* **Cardano (ADA):** 5%
* **Polkadot (DOT):** 5%
* **Polygon (MATIC):** 5%
* **Avalanche (AVAX):** 5%

# Exploration & Growth (5%)

For this category, I am considering speculative options that could complement my core portfolio. Some contenders include:

* **XRP:** Focused on efficient cross-border payments.
* **Chainlink (LINK):** Provides crucial Oracle technology for DeFi.
* **VeChain (VET):** Blockchain solutions for supply chain management.
* **Stellar (XLM):** Optimized for affordable and fast transactions.

# Investment Approach (example)

* **Lump Sum:** Allocate 25,000 USD immediately across the above projects
* **DCA:** Invest around 1,000-2,000 USD per month across the above projects

# Why These Coins?

I‚Äôve grouped these coins based on their roles in the crypto ecosystem‚Äîstore of value, smart contracts, scalability, and interoperability. My goal is to focus on projects with strong technical foundations, clear use cases, and active development teams. I believe this covers the essential pillars of the crypto space while avoiding speculative or meme-driven plays.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

* Does this strategy make sense for a long-term approach?
* Am I missing any critical projects that should be part of a long-term portfolio?
* Any thoughts on the allocation percentages or the technologies I‚Äôm focusing on?

I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback and insights. Thanks in advance for your time and advice!"

Is polygon a long-term play for you?,0xPolygon,1hicjqd,2024-12-20 00:09:18,16,0.81,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/1hicjqd/is_polygon_a_longterm_play_for_you/,Fantastic_Ad_3076,Discussion,"I like the tech for how I've used it and what i believe it could be used for as well as a lot of the people that I've met along the way. Some of the projects have left to other chains and other projects have come from other chains to polygon.

I read a lot of good stuff about the tech but also bad stuff about some of the people around Sandeep and even some of his own Behavior. Not sure what to make of it all. 

My initial bulk buy-in was around 75 cents avg. I still believe in the tech and a lot of the people and projects that run on it. I do not fully understand all of it and am invested in many coins and active on several chains but I like polygon the most and Solana second for art and connecting with other artists and investors (and memes). I also in a firm believer in Bitcoin & runes (DOG).

Just sharing my thoughts and creating another space for others to do the same. I've purchased several small lots of Matic over the past few years and now converted to then to POL. Minted and purchased nfts and utilized staking as well as bought into or earn meme coins or community currencies. Needless to say, I'm in it for the long haul. My children will inherit some polygon crypto and nfts. How about you? "

Shibarium Theory - A Must Read,ShibaInuCandorGroup,1hhr1tc,2024-12-19 06:39:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShibaInuCandorGroup/comments/1hhr1tc/shibarium_theory_a_must_read/,SHIBgeneral,,"This is a long read but well worth the time, in my opinion. 

A comment was made on one of our posts about Shibarium and whether it would be run on Polygon in an effort to reduce fees. A fellow member pointed out that Shytoshi had once commented that it wouldn't be run on polygon but a polygon like network inferring that the devs were attempting to develop their own layer 2 (L2) protocol. I've had some theories for a while and this really got me thinking... how does a new L2 for in with ShibaSwap tokenomics... and here's my theory. Please forgive me if I ramble at all, it's 2:30am here and I've had 5 hours of sleep in 2 days. Comment below and let me know what y'all think... am I onto something here or am I way out in left field on this? 


I remember reading that Shytoshi said Shibarium would be run on a polygon like protocol. I think it would be great if the devs in fact created their own L2 protocol, but my reservation is why recreate the wheel to get the same outcome? So that got me thinking what would I do if I was the devs to set ShibaSwap ahead of the competition. I dabble in programming just so I can try and understand some of this stuff, and I think I know the answer. If I'm way off please tell me, I'm not an expert by any means. Anyways, when we talk about defi protocols, the two that really compete are uniswap V3 and Sushiswap using polygon.  Both swaps are great in their own right but both have fundamental issues. V3 revolutionized the way liquidity pools operated. Traditional pools spread out your liquidity pairs from 0 to infinity, even though a significant portion of that range will never be used. V3 allowed for concentrated efficiency where a liquidity provider could concentrate their capital into specific price points reducing investor exposure to impermanent loss and increasing fees earned by over 500% in some pools (aka an investor could earn 5x the fees than a traditional liquidity pool). The downside was that gas fees are still ridiculously high on V3 because it's still using the Ethereum network. Then you have Sushiswap who built out a L2 through polygon reducing fees and increasing speed of transactions. It also allowed users to use the ""matic bridge"" to swap tokens between ERC20 and other networks, by a process of minting and burning tokens going back and forth. The beauty is it allowed users to access other cross chain tokens through a single interface, and best of all users paid for gas fees in their native Matic coin instead of Eth. Sushiswap also allowed users to access Kashi Lending whereby users could trade on leverage or margin, for those investors who wanted to take big swings in crypto. This also had the benefit of allowing liquidity providers to put up their tokens for margin trading, earning good returns and no exposure to impermanent loss since it was only 1 token investments. Sushiswap also developed a token vault known as BentoBox that allowed for margin trading in 1 transaction hash versus other margin trading platforms that required 3 transaction hashes, saving huge amounts on gas fees and increasing transaction speeds. 

I guess what I'm getting at is Shibarium needs to be if V3 Uniswap and Sushiswap protocols had a baby. Shibarium would allow for concentrated capital liquidity pools, the ability to switch tokens across different blockchains using SHIB as gas (only utility I can see for it... change my mind), and allow users access to margin and leveraged trading, while simultaneously allowing additional revenue streams for liquidity providers and creating token vaults. If Shibarium managed to incorporate the best of both swaps, it could begin to compete for heavy volume which would bring back the billion dollar TVL numbers. But if that weren't enough, if the devs could incorporate their own algorithmic stable coin Shi into the mix as a daily transactional token, whereby users could buy and sell with it, with minimal fees, and giving sellers the security of a stable coin, and the speed of visa, it would truly begin to revolutionize crypto. 

IF the devs can pull this off it would be a game changer in crypto defi platforms. SHIB would finally have a purpose, Shi would become a global currency, BONE would be highly coveted by whales who wanted governance over the future decisions of the swap, and LEASH would be the value store to bring in institutional investors, similar to what Bitcoin is. Uniswap earns $2-3M in fees per day, and Sushiswap earns $1.2M in fees per day (as of January), there's no reason ShibaSwap wouldn't be able to easily pull in $3-5M in fees through its platform if it was able to implement this plan. It's an ambitious goal but one that I think makes the most amount of sense and maybe why the devs are playing things pretty close to the vest as the saying goes because they don't want the other swaps to pivot before they release Shibarium. 

Let's hear your thoughts. Anyone else have a theory on what type of protocol Shibarium will run on or benefits they should implement? 

Also, if you know of other users who haven't been invited here, please help me continue to grow this page by sending them a message recommending they come check our page out. This article and others like it, are only going to have effect if we can get exposure to a larger audience. Personally I think this theory could give hope to so many who have begun losing hope in SHIB and the entire ecosystem....I know it gives me hope and in my mind it helps me begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together into a congruent picture. And it doesn't hurt that I believe if this happens, we're all going to be very well off having gotten in very early."
