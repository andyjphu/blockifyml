How does his reign go?

I honestly see him as the Baratheon version of Viserys I Targaryen. An amiable and generous king who loves to please, hopefully, he has children with Margaery but if not then he has Shireen his niece to secure the line of succession. "
[35M] #PA - Searching for Forever,ForeverAloneDating,1i9x02r,2025-01-25 16:04:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1i9x02r/35m_pa_searching_for_forever/,-Amphis_baena,M4F,"Hey, y'all. I'm pretty bad at selling myself, but I think that's what you're supposed to do when looking for a potential partner. Here's the thing: I'm getting older, and honestly would like to settle down and start a family. This isn't something that can be done quickly or haphazardly. I've had my share of relationships that I thought would last ""forever,"" and certainly didn't (apparently through no fault of my own), but I was always the one getting dumped. Common denominator, right? Anyways, here's some stuff about me so you can decide if you want to waste your time.

Looks: 6'4, a little chubby, but losing weight. Long black hair, beard, brown eyes, glasses. 3 tattoos. Usually wearing beanies, fashion sense hasn't really evolved beyond band tees, hoodies and jeans. I wear the occasional button down.

Interests:

* Music. I play guitar and bass and write my own music (very slowly). Favorite bands include, but are not limited to: BILMURI, Dance Gavin Dance, Coheed and Cambria, Streetlight Manifesto, Explosions in the Sky, Vulfpeck, Ren, the Wonder Years, and many more

* Reading. I prefer fantasy and horror. Am very into anything by Brandon Sanderson, the Dresden Files, and most Stephen King stuff.

* Cooking. I cook for work, and also like to cook in my spare time. But cooking for myself feels pretty lame sometimes.

* Video games. Favorite series are Final Fantasy, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil. Other favorite games include XCOM, PlateUp!, Hearthstone, and Stardew Valley

* Pro Wrestling. Yeah, I know it's silly, but I've been into it since I was a kid

Other things about me:

* ADHD as hellll. Working on getting it under control, hopefully through medication

* In therapy for negative self talk/views. I have had several (albeit very weak) suicide attempts in the past, and ended up voluntarily committing myself to a mental hospital for a bit. It was a good idea.

* 2 cats, Merry and Pippin

* Kinda clingy, kinda anxious. I know that can be a turnoff for some, and I try hard to control it, but that's just the way I am. This is also due to some of my past relationships

I've been told I'm an amazing partner, but the circumstances were always wrong. I'd like to have the right circumstances, y'know? Anyways, if you got this far, send me a chat. It'd be nice to hear from you. I hope you all find what you're looking for. Have a good night!"

He‚Äôs simply asking what Palpatine wants in return for the help of his fleet on Exegol, if anything, which is a pretty valid concern considering this is the first anyone in the First Order aside from Ren are hearing of this.

Normally my server starts lagging when we have around 900-1,000 players online. Recently ended up dropping to 19 tps when we hit our record of 1,036 online.

Just wondering what other peoples experience in hosting a large server is.

For reference I only use a single paper server, and a single world so not able to be like hypixel and have a lot of minigames so not sure what I can optimize.

What is the best path forward for better performance and letting more players play at the same time?

I want as little fuss as possible setting them up, and would like to avoid the purchase of a AVR if possible. 

Ideally I'd get something like the kanto ren's or klispch the fives, since these have hdmi input, but would also consider something with optical input if it's a good value. 

Although, as I understand it with optical input you then need a separate remote control for the speakers and the tv (unlike with hdmi input, where your tv remote can also control the speaker volume). 

I've tried a soundbar (sony hts2000) and was unimpressed.

My TV is lg oled b4. 

Would like to keep it to about 300 usd. "

You will need different email addresses for each person.
You can use same mobile numbers for different persons.

Tip: Select B1/B2 always.

There are three options to pick passport
Premium Delivery: Fees is INR 850 per passport. Passport will be delivered to address provided
‚ÄãPremium Pickup: Pickup from VFS Location. Fees INR 850 will be applicable.
‚ÄãConsulate Pickup: Pickup from Embassy. Free

First you have to book OFC slot then consular slot.
You can reschedule only once after booking both slots.
Rescheduling attempt will be counted only if both OFC and consular slots are booked.

Tip: You have to book both OFC and consular appointment in 30 minutes otherwise OFC appointment will be cancelled.

Tip: There are some agents also who can book slots. There is no trick with agents. Its just they are trying regularly. They will do slot searching in place of you. Charge can vary from person to person. There are many fraud agents also. So, whether agent is genuine or fraud, you have to decide yourself.

My experience: I booked slots myself. First, I got appointment of Jan 2026. At first rescheduling attempt, I was able to book in Oct 2025. Then in second attempt I got slots of 29 Dec 2024 for OFC and 9 Jan 2025 for Consular.

Tip: There are some websites like https://visaslots.info/ which shows availability of slots.

Tip: There are some extensions like Check US Visa Slots, VisaSlots.info which can be helpful while booking slots

Tip: There are some certain times like exact X:00 or X:30 where X=0,1,2,‚Ä¶.23 where slot appearance probability is highest.



 
3. OFC Appointment experience

My OFC appointment was on 29 Dec 2024, Kolkata.
You should reach the VAC 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

Documents needed: Passport, Appointment confirmation print, DS160(old and new if any) confirmation print.

No electronics/bag will be allowed.
Only polythene bag containing documents will be allowed.
You do not need to take children (below 14 years) to VAC. Their photograph (2in by 2in) will be sufficient.
At Kolkata VAC, there was locker facility(run by a third party) in the basement of the building. VAC was at the 4th floor.
Security staff allowed us after checking appointment confirmation and belongings.
Reached VAC office and got in queue. The person at the gate checked documents and allowed in the office. (Wait time was around 15 min)
First, we went to a desk. The person in charge put a sticker containing UID and DS160 number on the back of passport. We got our new DS160 updated. New DS160 sticker was also put on the back. These stickers were checked at the time of interview.
Then we proceeded to another desk where a lady first asked about the language in which we are comfortable. Then she verified details from DS160. Asked to put fingers on the machine to record fingerprints. Then clicked photograph. That‚Äôs it. OFC appointment done. A stamp of VAC was put on DS160 confirmation. This page will be needed at the time of interview.
 


4. Consular Interview Experience

My consular appointment date was 9 Jan 2025(Delhi). But it got rescheduled by the embassy itself to 21 Jan 2025. Embassy informed me via e mail.
Documents needed: Appointment confirmation print, VAC Stamped DS160 print, Passports
Other Documents I carried: Old Passports, Last 6 month Bank statement, Salary certificate/GST Registration certificate, Last 3 years ITR, Marriage certificate. (none of which were asked by the Visa officer). I knew beforehand that I wont be asked any document but I did not want to take any risk. That‚Äôs why I carried all those documents which I could think of, to support my DS160 form.
 
We reached embassy around 8:30am.
Outside Main Gate, appointment confirmation page and passports were checked. Security staff checked belonging and did a thorough frisking.
Then we proceeded to the entry gate, where airport style security checking was being done. After that many benches were there in the waiting area. On that day, that waiting area was empty so we were being forwarded to the next zone of building.
We were sent to a counter where documents were rechecked and then sent to another counter where biometrics were captured again to verify. Then we were sent to a queue for interview. Wait time was around 30 minutes. All type of visa interview candidates were in the queue. Some points which we observed while being in the queue.
a. Confidence is the key.

b. 80% outcome is pre-decided. You can mess up your interview by giving information in contradiction to your DS160.

c. Short answers are more effective.

d. Previous international travels/Government Job are plus points.

e. Being Single/Unemployed/First time international travel are negative points

f. Having child(ren) with you during interview can be a big plus point

g. You can ask for translator if you are not comfortable in English. This won‚Äôt have any effect on outcome.

h. Be truthful.

Questions asked to us
1. Why do you want to travel?
2. What do you do for living?
3. What is your monthly income?
4. How many years of work experience at current organization?
5. Any international travel with family in last 5 years?

That‚Äôs it. Visa approved.
Feel free to ask anything

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I set the alarm app on my iPhone for 6:30 AM Saturday morning so Brooke and I could get an early start. We had a lot of prepping and cooking to do in order to be ready to serve as many as twelve guests later that day: hors d‚Äôoeuvres and cocktails were scheduled for 6 PM and dinner was to be served at 7:30.

However, we were awoken not by the obnoxious ringing noise on my phone at 6 AM, but rather by repeated rings of our doorbell an hour earlier. I was lying next to Brooke in bed, startled out of a deep sleep by the insistent sound. Brooke was a deeper sleeper than I was, so I was the first one to get up out of bed. As was typical, I was sleeping in an old T-shirt and a pair of panties, so I quickly put on my bathrobe and hurried downstairs to answer the door. It was still completely dark outside. Standing on our porch was Luke‚Äôs brother, Kevin.

‚ÄúTook you long enough,‚Äù he said, rudely.

‚ÄúHi, Kevin,‚Äù I replied, drowsily. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. We weren‚Äôt expecting you. Did you tell one of us you planned on coming by this morning?‚Äù

Behind me, I heard Brooke say, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there, Walter?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, darling. It‚Äôs just Kevin‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòJust Kevin.‚Äô I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a smart way to talk about your new boss, Wally. I sure hope you‚Äôve been studying up on those DIY plumbing videos on YouTube, like I told you to in December,‚Äù Kevin said, walking boldly past me into our house.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me,‚Äù said Brooke, sleepy and annoyed. She was too groggy to be polite. I‚Äôm fairly certain that had she been alert, she would‚Äôve been more careful in her choice of words and in her attitude.

‚ÄúNice to see you, too, Brooke. Also not a very respectful way to talk to your future babysitter. That‚Äôs okay, there‚Äôll be plenty of time to teach you both to mind your manners later. I‚Äôm here to drop off Luke‚Äôs stuff. Put some clothes on Wally, and help me bring in the boxes. They‚Äôre in back of my truck.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Kevin. I‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I said, turning to go upstairs to change.

Kevin interrupted me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to get back into the habit of calling me ‚Äòsir‚Äô, son. Since I‚Äôm going to be both your boss and your babysitter from now on,‚Äù the brash teenager said to me, chuckling.

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. Walter is not your son, Kevin,‚Äù said Brooke.

It was, indeed, completely ridiculous for an 18-year-old plumber to be calling a 40-year-old literature professor ‚Äúson.‚Äù Nevertheless, Kevin was in the midst of his ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù visit, clearly in a position of power now. Though we then had no idea of the depth and extent of it, Brooke and I were in a position of weakness, what was to become our new normal. It certainly was not a good idea to antagonize him. 

‚ÄúBe careful, Brooke,‚Äù I warned.

‚ÄúYou better listen to your little hubbie, Brooke, if you know what‚Äôs good for you. You‚Äôre going to be calling me ‚Äòsir‚Äô soon enough yourself,‚Äù Kevin said, with an arrogant smirk very similar to that of his big brother.

Brooke glared at him, but at least didn‚Äôt say anything else to challenge him. 

As I started to go back up the stairs, Kevin interrupted me, ‚ÄúWait a minute, son. What are you wearing under that robe? Turn around and take it off.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶yes, sir,‚Äù I said, reluctantly removing my robe. I saw Brooke roll her eyes.

Brooke had told me that she planned to lock me back in my chastity cage that afternoon before we went over to Luke‚Äôs house. But at that moment, I was still free. Like many men, I nearly always woke up with a hard-on ‚Äì the morning wood, I believe it is called ‚Äì and I was probably harder than on most mornings given this humiliating encounter with Kevin (the usual collusion between my treacherous cock and my submissive brain). He stared down at my cock, tenting out my panties.

‚ÄúHa ha. Just like I thought. You‚Äôre pathetic, Wally. It‚Äôs no wonder why Brooke begged Luke to start banging her again. She needs a real man‚Äôs cock, not your pansy pin dick. You too, Brooke. Let‚Äôs see what ‚Äì If anything, ha ha ‚Äì you‚Äôve got on under your robe.‚Äù

Brooke continued to regard Kevin with a death glare, but, while she didn‚Äôt completely remove her robe as I had, she did open it up momentarily, giving him a glimpse of her body, naked except for her panties. Whereas I had on a fuller pair of navy blue boyshorts panties (trying to hide from Brooke the lingering effects of Paul‚Äôs strapping, as my ass was still quite red when we went to bed last night), Brooke was wearing a pair of maroon, cheeky panties (quite skimpy). Her nipples were rock hard, a fact which did not escape Kevin‚Äôs attention. We both saw him look directly at her breasts and smile, before she closed her robe.

‚ÄúYou must be cold, Brooke. Or, maybe, you‚Äôre actually hot. Ha ha. It is pretty warm in here. You two really should start wearing matching panties. Get your ass upstairs and get dressed, Wally. My first job is across town in 45 minutes. I don‚Äôt have all fucking day. How about a cup of coffee, Brooke?‚Äù he said, more an order than a request.

‚ÄúI was just about to make some anyhow,‚Äù Brooke said, testily, before walking towards the kitchen. I ran upstairs and slipped on a pair of sweatpants.

Probably because he was in a hurry, Kevin helped me bring the boxes into the house. However, he didn‚Äôt help to bring them upstairs into the bedroom (still more work for me and Brooke to do later). There seemed to be about a third fewer boxes than he took away in December. 

As if reading my my mind, he said to me as we carried in a particularly heavy one together (no doubt, containing some of Luke‚Äôs extensive footwear collection), ‚ÄúYou probably notice that there‚Äôs not as many boxes now. That‚Äôs because Luke wants you and Brooke spending more time at his house, especially when it‚Äôs warmer out. I can‚Äôt wait. I‚Äôm sick of this shitty, cold weather.‚Äù It was 22 degrees that late February day, and I shared Kevin‚Äôs fatigue with the cold weather. 

After we finished with the boxes, Kevin walked into the kitchen and said to Brooke, ‚ÄúPut my coffee in a thermos or something. I‚Äôve got to get going.‚Äù

Eager to be rid of him, Brooke filled up one of our Hydro Flasks with coffee and asked, ‚ÄúDo you take milk or sugar?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs more like it. Milk, two teaspoons of sugar. Both of you will know all of my and Kaylee‚Äôs preferences real well before long. Which reminds me, Luke wanted me to tell you both to be at his house by noon.‚Äù

As Brooke poured the milk into the Hydro Flask, she said, ‚ÄúHe said the guests will start arriving at 6 PM. We won‚Äôt need anywhere near that long to get ready. We weren‚Äôt planning on getting there until 3.‚Äù

‚ÄúChange of plans,‚Äú Kevin said with another smirk. ‚ÄúLuke‚Äôs cleaning lady called in sick yesterday, so he wants you there early to give the place a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms and the kitchen. He said you should bring another set of clothes to clean in and then you can take a shower afterwards before you change into what you‚Äôre gonna wear when you serve everyone snacks and dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù said Brooke. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound that happy, Brooke,‚Äù Kevin said, smirk intact. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a lot of work, is all. Tell Luke we‚Äôll be there. Thanks for bringing his stuff,‚Äù Brooke said.

‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äú Kevin replied, as he took his coffee and walked out of the side door that led to our driveway. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll be seeing a lot more of each other real soon,‚Äù he added with a wink, before the door closed behind him.

‚ÄúGood morning, darling,‚Äù I said with a smile, trying to make light of Kevin‚Äôs most unpleasant, surprise visit. 

‚ÄúI hate that bratty, fucking little snitch. He makes my skin crawl,‚Äù Brooke said.

‚ÄúMine, too. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs part of the package with Luke.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Kevin and apparently his skanky girlfriend, Kaylee, too. Not to mention Luke‚Äôs cunt of a girlfriend, whatever her name is. I guess we‚Äôre going to be everyone‚Äôs little bitches.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find out her name soon enough, I guess. Do you think she‚Äôll be there tonight? You know, as his date for the dinner?‚Äù I asked, with trepidation. I hesitated to bring up this subject with Brooke, but it was certainly weighing on my mind. I knew meeting Luke‚Äôs girlfriend was going to be incredibly difficult for her.

‚ÄúNo, I asked him point-blank and he said that she‚Äôs traveling. Thank god for small favors, at least. Tonight‚Äòs going to be humiliating enough as it is without me having to meet this bitch on top of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think his leadership team will know who we are? Maybe they‚Äôll just assume we‚Äôre the caterers?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kidding? Of course, they‚Äôll know exactly who we are. I told you about Luke‚Äôs reputation ‚Äì how he publicly cuckolded and totally emasculated his first boss. And how he‚Äôs done that with several others since, including other co-workers and employees of his. Maybe not to the same extent as his old boss. But he‚Äôs slept with their wives and rubbed their noses in it. This is his brand, Walter: big swingin dick, Luke Hanover. He revels in it. You can be quite certain that everyone there is going to know that his ex-wife and her English professor husband are the ones waiting on them all like Luke‚Äôs little lackeys. Luke will be in all his glory tonight, and having us there as his servants will be icing on the cake.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell maybe people will think that we have a catering business on the side?‚Äù I ventured.

‚ÄúYeah, and maybe they‚Äôll also think we‚Äôre from outer space. Get real.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I get it. It‚Äôs going to be humiliating. Are you really sure you‚Äôre up for all of this, Brooke?‚Äù I asked.

She looked me in the eyes and touched my arm. ‚ÄúWalter, I know you mean well, but you have to stop asking me that. This is the price I have to pay to have Luke back. I‚Äôm going in with eyes wide open. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm always going to be happy about what‚Äôs going on or that I‚Äôm not going to complain about it. Sometimes, I‚Äôm probably even going to cry about it or rage about it. But that doesn‚Äôt change fact that I‚Äôm all in, 100%, for this next crazy chapter in our lives. Come what may.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe newest twist in the game,‚Äú I said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. But what about you, my loyal knight? I‚Äôm the one who should be asking you: are you sure YOU‚ÄôRE up for all this? Especially tonight, being a waiter for all of these corporate blowhards? I know the type well. I mean, I wait on these types of people all the time at the restaurant. I‚Äôve been a waitress for a long time now, so I‚Äôm used to the humiliations service workers are routinely subjected to ‚Äì although, admittedly, it‚Äôs going to be on a whole different level tonight. But you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs a lot different being in charge of a classroom than being a waiter or a waitress.‚Äù

Brooke, of course, did not know about the all of humiliation I suffered after I lost control of my class last year following the Ren fair. She did not know that I was now under the control of a few of my former students, compelled each week to cook for them, and to serve as serve as their maid. She was not aware that I had become the coffee boy and foot masseuse of my fellow professor and friend. All of the above , byproducts of Luke‚Äôs domination, of course. Except for those few occasions that Brooke was present when I was humiliated in front of a wider group of people ‚Äì such as when I served as a waiter when Neil and Laura came over for dinner, or when she and I cheered Luke on at his football games, or at the Ren faire itself ‚Äì she was really only aware of my submission to her, and to Luke, of course. Still, she certainly knew that I was no stranger to humiliation. 

However, I had a strong suspicion that the impending humiliation we were facing with Luke‚Äôs return was going to be far more challenging for Brooke to endure than for me ‚Äì that, in fact, it was going to be far more challenging for her to endure than she realized. Because, whereas I am fundamentally a beta, Brooke is fundamentally an alpha. I can hear some of those reading this say, ‚ÄúYeah, sure. She‚Äôs an alpha just like she‚Äôs a feminist ‚Äì allowing Luke to dominate her and degrade her in the sack. She‚Äôs a real alpha, all right.‚Äù But, as I have explained before, Brooke is turned on by being sexually dominated and degraded by a certain type of alpha male ‚Äì in fact, it seems as though Luke is the only one who truly fits that bill for her (so far, at least). And even with Luke, she long resisted submitting to him outside of the bedroom; that‚Äôs why she divorced him in the first place. She was now agreeing to this new, broader level of submission because she has accepted the fact that she is sexually addicted to him ‚Äì and, realizing the intensity of her addiction, Luke set these conditions for her to continue to have access to her drug. It is either submit or do without the drug. As we have seen, the withdrawal pains for her were not sustainable.

But in virtually every other aspect of her life, Brooke is generally the one in control. She is obviously completely in control of me. Even at the restaurant, although a waitress, she is generally looked up to by the younger waitresses such as Laura and even by the more seasoned waitstaff and other restaurant staff. Her bosses (even her sexist manager) know that she possesses intellectual capability well beyond her job, and respect her competence, judgement and work ethic. And, over the years, there have been many lecherous male patrons of the restaurant, and rude customers of both sexes, who have been put in their place by Brooke. In her friendships, too ‚Äì such as with Laura and her estranged friend Michelle ‚Äì Brooke is the one who is generally deferred to. She is confident, strong willed, a natural leader. She is also fiercely competitive, someone who likes to win (whether a tennis match, a board game, or an argument) and who usually does. For those who can‚Äôt see how it is possible for someone to have an alpha personality and also be sexually submissive ‚Äì to be, in essence, a feminist but still allow herself to be sexually degraded  ‚Äì I‚Äôm sorry for you that you see things only in black and white, and are incapable of understanding how two opposing things can be true at the same time.

As Brooke‚Äôs devoted knight (her chivalrous cuckold, as Anna put it), it was my job ‚Äì indeed, my sacred duty ‚Äì to stand by her side during what I knew would be an incredibly trying period for her. It was my job to console her if she wanted to cry on my shoulder, to be her punching bag if she needed someone to take her frustrations out on, to absorb as much of the humiliation directed her way as possible so as to lighten her burden. Why, you may ask? Because that‚Äôs what knights do for their ladies, that‚Äôs why. Because I love her more than I have ever loved anyone, or anything, in my life. 

So I answered her question by dropping to my knees, and saying to her, ‚ÄúI would gladly suffer any and all humiliations for you, my lady.‚Äù I then removed her slipper and reverently kissed her bare right foot. I was completely serious, but levity also has its place at times like these. So, I next looked up at her and smiled, ‚ÄúWhen we get to Luke‚Äôs, I‚Äôm going to say to him, ‚ÄòLittle bitch Walter reporting for duty, sir!‚Äô‚Äù

Brooke looked down on me, grabbed my head with her hands and pulled me towards her body. She smiled somewhat sadly and said, ‚ÄúI love you. You‚Äôre really too good for me, you know that?‚Äù And then she smiled more fully and said, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll stand right beside you and say to him: ‚ÄúLittle bitch Brooke reporting for duty, sir!‚Äù 

I stood up and said, laughing, ‚ÄúUse and abuse to your heart‚Äôs content, sir!‚Äù

Still smiling, now more wistfully, she said, ‚ÄúHe really will, you know. But maybe after the dinner party, he‚Äôll use and abuse us in a good way, at least. Well, I guess we‚Äôd better get to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, if Luke isn‚Äôt bringing anyone to his dinner, we‚Äôll only have eleven people to feed,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI bought enough for twelve portions.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. Maybe he‚Äôll allow the help eat the leftovers,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúIt IS going to be a pretty awesome meal.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly going to be an expensive meal. Do you think he‚Äôll reimburse us for all the groceries?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said he would. Just not for our slave labor, obviously.‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù I said.

An hour before we left for Luke‚Äôs, Brooke locked me back in my chastity cage. 

‚ÄúYour little cock has been free for so long, at least for the most part. But you‚Äôre all out of get of jail free cards now, I‚Äôm afraid,‚Äù she said, smiling, as she pulled my panties down with one hand and held my cage with the other. I got immediately hard. 

‚ÄúOh my, I think it‚Äôs excited to be locked up again. Go get a bag of ice.‚Äù 

After she iced me down she was able to get the cage over my momentarily flaccid cock and pulled my balls through the base ring. I had just gotten a full body waxing two days earlier, so my cock and balls were completely hairless. As soon as I was locked up, my cock started to inflate again, pushing up against the cold metal rings of the DOMINIX Deluxe chastity cage Brooke had bought me for Christmas. 

‚ÄúI think it likes its new prison. I‚Äôm going to keep one key on my anklet and give the other one to Luke, of course. That way, he‚Äôll have a key to both of your cock cages.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I just wish you could wait till after dinner to put it on me. Those pants that he wants me to wear are so tight, I‚Äôm afraid everyone will be able to see the bulk beneath them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI doubt it. Your black waiter pants will hide it a lot better than yoga pants at least; I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs not making you wear those. Too informal, I suppose. Besides, maybe Luke will let you wear the apron Michelle bought you last year. It‚Äô‚Äôs effeminate, but at least it will hide any bulk. I really like the looks of this chastity cage ‚Äì the curve, the rings. Look how shiny it is!‚Äù she said as she flicked my cage with her finger nail. ‚ÄúNow you really are my knight in shining armor.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really feel prepared to go to battle in this armor, my lady. I feel very‚Ä¶very weak.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour weakness is your strength, my knight.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs really true, I‚Äôm invincible,‚Äù I said, with a slight laugh.

Luke greeted us at the door when we got to his house at 12 noon sharp. Brooke and I were dressed in sweatpants and T-shirts, ready to clean, and brought our serving uniforms along in a bag. We had also brought along several bags and trays of food, a mixture of hors d‚Äôoeuvres and dishes we had already prepared that just need to be heated up, and the ingredients to make several more dishes. 

‚ÄúGood. You‚Äôre on time. My cleaning lady ‚Äì ex cleaning lady, I should say ‚Äì called in sick yesterday. Seems like she‚Äôs always calling in sick, but for her to do it right before my big dinner really pisses me off. She‚Äôs done. You‚Äôll find all the cleaning supplies in the basement. I want this place to really sparkle tonight,‚Äù Luke said, by way of greeting.

‚ÄúNo kiss or anything?‚Äù Brooke said to him, with a faint smile. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time for that now. Do a great job tonight ‚Äì which you‚Äôd better ‚Äì and there might be a reward later. But, for now, you two have way too much work to do to be worried about anything other than getting it done. I left some things for you to wear tonight on the kitchen table.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe brought what we‚Äôre wearing with us. Just what you told us to bring. I‚Äôm wearing my waitress uniform and Walter‚Äôs wearing exactly what he did the first time he cooked you dinner,‚Äù Brooke said.

‚ÄúGood. Yes, that‚Äôs what I told you to do, but I got you a couple of little things to add or substitute. I told you how important this dinner is to me. Remember, I just hired my CMO ‚Äì that‚Äôs chief marketing officer, prof ‚Äì as the last member of my executive team. So, my CMO is the guest of honor. But this is really a celebration of the fact that I‚Äôve finally got my whole leadership team in place. I expect you both to address everyone as sir and ma‚Äôam throughout the evening. Every time you take a drink order. Every time you offer them something to eat. Every time you interact with them in any way. Treat them all with respect, especially the guest of honor. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù we both said, almost in unison. 

‚ÄúIs the cuck locked up?‚Äù Luke asked Brooke. 

‚ÄúYes, sir. Securely. I got him a new cage for Christmas. I think you‚Äôre going to like it. Here‚Äôs your key. It‚Äôs the original. I‚Äôm wearing the copy on my anklet,‚Äù Brooke said as she handed him my key.

‚ÄúGood. Your furlough is finished, I‚Äôm afraid, prof.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I said, feeling my cock twitch.

‚ÄúHow many people will there be tonight?‚Äù Brooke asked. 

‚ÄúOnly ten. My CFO and his wife. My COO and his wife. My CHRO and his wife. My head of sales and his date. My new CMO, and me. Neither of us are bringing a date. You can take any leftovers home.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù said Brooke. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some things to do in town. I‚Äô‚Äôll be back by 3 to check on your cleaning.‚Äù

Mercifully, except for Luke‚Äôs bedroom and en-suite bathroom, the house was not especially filthy. Even so, the two of us had to work at a frenetic pace to thoroughly clean a 6000-square foot house in three hours. Meanwhile, we saw what Luke had left for us on the counter: a pink bowtie (obviously for me to substitute for my black one) and sheer pink, nylon socks for me; a black leather choker for Brooke; and name tags for both of us ‚Äì ‚ÄúBrooke‚Äù and ‚ÄúProf‚Äù (just in case any of the guests had not gotten the memo about who were waiting on them that evening). 

When Luke got back at 3 PM, he inspected the rooms to ensure that our cleaning was up to his standards while Brooke and I showered and changed into our serving uniforms to begin preparing the hors d‚Äôoeuvres and dishes for dinner. Fortunately, he seemed pleased with our efforts. Then he asked us to stand next to each other and he inspected us. My new socks were readily apparent, as my tight, black pants ended several inches above my ankles; at least, I wasn‚Äôt required to be barefoot as I was the first time I served Luke (instead, I wore a pair of black dress shoes, which contrasted absurdly with the pink, nylon socks). Overall, I looked absolutely ridiculous in my tight black shirt and pants, vividly offset by the pink tie and socks. Brooke was wrong; the bulk of my chastity cage was clearly visible beneath the fabric of my pants. The black apron at least hid my crotch from view; effeminate as it was, I was grateful to be wearing it.

Luke quickly dispelled that temporary comfort. ‚ÄúProf, you can wear the apron when you‚Äôre working in the kitchen, but lose it when you‚Äôre serving food or drinks. Take it off now.‚Äù 

When I did, he looked down at my crotch area, the presence of my cage painfully obvious (and causing pain, as my cock swelled in its confines under his critical eye), and smirked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve really have gotten tubby over the last couple of months, haven‚Äôt you? I can see your belly fat bulging over your belt, and those pants are really tight on you. Well, your first weigh-in is tomorrow at 5 PM. Our mutual good buddy Neil and I will whip you into shape in no time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. Thank you, sir,‚Äù I said, wondering how literal he was being. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it, prof. It‚Äôs going to be my pleasure, believe me,‚Äù he said, continuing to smirk.

My cage wasn‚Äôt the only thing obvious to the guests that evening, as Luke ostentatiously wore a silver chain with the key to my chastity cage dangling over the second button of his dress shirt. Everyone there could clearly see that their boss, the ex husband of my wife, was my keyholder. 

In her waitress uniform, Brooke looked almost exactly as she had the night I ran into her at the restaurant for the first time since being her professor. That was now nearly twenty months ago. What a journey we had been on since that fateful evening! Brooke‚Äôs restaurant catered to a largely male, corporate clientele, so the owners hired mostly young, attractive women as waitresses, and the short skirt, heels and sheer, black stockings ‚Äì while by no means over-the-top or indecent ‚Äì were clearly intended to appeal to the male patrons. However, the choker was something else altogether. The choker Luke had left out for Brooke to put on was similar to the one Brooke had made me wear to my class last semester in that it was leather. However, it was really like the choker she had teasingly threatened to make me wear; it had a metal ring embedded in the front of it ‚Äì not sticking out, but still something to which a leash could conceivably be attached. In other words, it more overtly resembled a slave collar. Brooke looked incredibly sexy in it, especially with the red lipstick and makeup she was wearing (also at Luke‚Äôs behest). But she also looked submissive (for some reason, she made me think of Princess Leia enslaved by Jabba the Hutt) . She brushed it off by saying to me that women were wearing chokers these days ironically, to reclaim power and bodily autonomy. I didn‚Äôt buy it (especially since it wasn‚Äôt her decision to wear it). Maybe that would‚Äôve been plausible for a choker without that ring, but to me the choker Brooke wore screamed that she was someone‚Äôs property. And clearly not the property of the guy wearing a pink bowtie and socks. More likely the property of the man wearing the key to that guy‚Äôs chastity cage around his neck. 

As if that were not enough, during his inspection of us, Luke ordered Brooke to remove her black jacket and her bra, so that her nipples would be visible through her snug fitting white shirt. When she removed her bra in front of us, Luke walked up to her and firmly grasped her nipples in his fingers.

Brooke moaned at his touch, pushing her body up against him and arching her neck upwards to try to kiss him. Rather than kiss her, he squeezed her nipples.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt hide your best asset, slut. Everyone tonight should be able to enjoy looking at your tits. If I thought about beforehand, I‚Äôd have bought Hooters uniforms for you both to wear.‚Äù

Brooke laughed. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Luke asked. 

‚ÄúI just had a mental picture of Walter in a Hooters uniform,‚Äù Brooke replied. She, of course, had no idea that I had already been forced to wear one and model it for my students in early December. How surreal my life had become, I thought. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you who I‚Äôd like to see in that uniform. You don‚Äôt have huge tits like the Hooters girls, but everyone should be able to see your Goldilocks tits.‚Äù Luke was correct in his appraisal of Brooke‚Äôs perfect breasts: they were neither too big nor too small but just right, with lovely protruding nipples. He squeezed her nipples harder. I could see her grimace in a mixture of pain and arousal. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wear your jacket tonight. And throw away your damn bra. You should never wear a bra.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù Brooke said, still pushing up against him. ‚ÄúCould you please make love to me now. Walter can start preparing the dishes. We have plenty of time,‚Äù she asked him. 

‚ÄúMake love to you? Fuck you, you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir, fuck me. Fuck me senseless. It can be quick.‚Äù 

Still gripping her nipples, Luke said, ‚ÄúYou and the cuck are I in what I call a probationary period with new employees at my company. Fuck up tonight in, like not being attentive or respectful enough to my guests, and you‚Äôre fired. Simple as that. Kevin will move all my stuff back out tomorrow. If you do a good job, on the other hand, I‚Äôll fuck your brains out tomorrow. Would you like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.  We‚Äôll do a great job, I promise. Please fuck my brains out,‚Äù Brooke begged him, as he squeezed her nipples harder. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been acting like a pretty dumb slut lately, but if I fuck your brains out, you‚Äôll be a complete bimbo. Do you want that?‚Äù he asked, continuing to squeeze.

I hated this. Perhaps more than anything else, I hated him denigrating Brooke‚Äôs intelligence; possibly the only thing I hated more than that was hearing Brooke denigrate her own, to appease him. 

‚ÄúYes, please, I want that. Fuck me so hard that I can‚Äôt think at all. Make me your bimbo, Luke. Sir.‚Äù

Luke walked behind Brooke and grasped her neck tightly with his large hand and pushed his hand down into the front of her skirt. She gasped and closed her eyes, as he appeared to touch and rub her vagina with his fingers under her skirt and stockings. Grasping her neck was so gratuitous; it was all about control and domination

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she moaned. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre leaking like a faucet, slut.‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she moaned again, quietly. She was not begging him to stop.

Although I couldn‚Äôt see underneath her clothes, it appeared as though he was thrusting his fingers in and out of her vagina. She pushed her body backwards against him and bucked her pelvis. He then pulled his hand out of her skirt, and held up his two visibly moist fingers, smiling at me malevolently. 

He then inserted his two fingers into Brooke‚Äôs mouth. Closing her eyes, she obediently sucked her secretions off Luke‚Äôs fingers as he said, ‚ÄúYour panties are soaking. Don‚Äôt be dripping all over my nice clean floors now, slut. Now I‚Äôm gonna let you two get to work; I know you‚Äôve got a lot to do. Later, when my guests start to arrive, I want Brooke to greet the female guests at the door by saying, ‚ÄúHello ma‚Äôam, welcome to Mr. Hanover‚Äôs home.‚Äô Then offer to take their coats, bring them into the living room and take their drink orders. Prof, you do the same for the men. Once everybody is settled with a cocktail you can start serving the hors d‚Äôoeuvres. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù we both said. 

When Luke left the room, Brooke simply said, ‚ÄúBastard‚Äù (whether more out of of humiliation or frustration was difficult to say). She was still breathing heavily, her face and neck flushed.

We worked hard for the next three hours to assemble the hors d‚Äôoeuvres and to begin cooking those that needed to be served warm as well as the entr√©es and side dishes. Luke had a well stocked bar, but I made sure everything was in order to be able to mix cocktails. He had also purchased a case of beer and several bottles of wine.

Luke came down from his bedroom at 5:45, ready for the arrival of his guests. He was dressed in a dress pants and dress shirt with a sports coat and black dress shoes. That was the first time that I saw the key to my chastity cage dangling from a chain around his neck. I served him a Gentleman Jack on the rocks, while he waited. 

When the doorbell rang promptly at 6 PM, Luke said to us, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs showtime. Look sharp.‚Äù"
My Interpretation of What Happened to the 202X Rivals [without Ayano]:,RyobaAishi,1i9se9x,2025-01-25 12:43:05,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RyobaAishi/comments/1i9se9x/my_interpretation_of_what_happened_to_the_202x/,FutureDiaryAyano,Discussion,"Please let me know if the flair is wrong.



Osana Najimi [Osami Nakajima] - She and Taro eventually married and she got to become a veterinarian, which gave her a deeper appreciation for dogs [although she's still VERY MUCH a cat person]. They had a daughter, Reika. Keika [Osana's cat] lived to seventeen years of age and they eventually adopted another cat when she was ten, Kit-Kat, a male.



Amai Odayaka [Amai Odagawa] - She became a chef for her mother's bakery and eventually took it over when her parents retired. She married a man who is a stray at home dad to their two sons and daughter, Ren, Haruto, and Anna. She eventually got the cat she wanted [although she still loves Ham-Ham] and just makes sure to wash thoroughly before work.



Kizana Sunobu [Kizana Suno] - Although talented, nobody wanted to work with this diva. She instead became an acting coach who got mild fame in her hometown, but had a similar reputation to that of Abby Lee Miller [screaming at the kids and parents, demanding perfection].



Oka Ruto [Oka Rakuyona] - She became a counselor with her platonic life partner, Shin, and lives with her female partner. They cannot marry, as Japan doesn't allow it, nor adopt, but they wanted to be child-free anyway.



Asu Rito [Asuka ""Asu"" Rinsh≈ç] - She remained single to focus on her career and managed to win a gold medal for Japan in a swimming competition at the Olympics. She is now a personal coach and adopted a daughter, Minami.



Muja Kina [Momoko Kino] - Unfortunately, she never made it far in the medical field, but became a secretary for the local hospital. She is still very close to her college friends and finally got a boyfriend, who she lives with.

It‚Äôs me again! Now with an updated thought exercise! Improved Domestic and diplomatic stuff. So enjoy!  
  
Queue the second term fanfiction! Since I‚Äôve finished my Sordland AAR (link above) I wanted to make/create/envision a second term. Or headcanon, whatever you want to call it. But this is not an epilogue (yet), rather a list of ideas, plans and thought exercises of what would happen in a socialist Rayne‚Äôs second term. And if Suzerain wasn‚Äôt such a pain in the ass to mod I would try to make one. But alas.  
  
  
PS. If The pictures are fucky tell me I'll repost with it fixed.

**Main term mechanics/problems**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coalition/cabinet stability/support

Now that Rayne has won a second term and the PSP has a plurality, he will be forced to form the first coalition government in Sordlands history. But with whom?

https://preview.redd.it/lmepfj4k46fe1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0985813a05a7ff7307c68f8b35c6bcd203e81382

So, from left to right: PSP, USP, NFP, PFJP, CPS, WPB and BFP  
So what are the options for a coalition?

\-The centrist way: a coalition with the PFJP. Coalition negotiations will require a lot of compromise on your socialist agenda but¬†*should*¬†not anger the more reactionary elements of the country, like the military. This will ofcourse include appeasing Ricter and keeping him happy. We don‚Äôt want a fallen government right? And not to mention you just¬†*barely*¬†have a majority in the GNA.  
I‚Äôll call this coalition ‚Äúthe purple coalition‚Äù after blue+red=purple.  
**Coalition stability: middling + reactionary threat: low**

\-The revolutionary way:¬† a coalition with the CPS and the WBP should not be very difficult and you could go all out with your agenda. You also have a comfortable majority, that plus working with very like-minded parties government stability will not be a problem. Just make sure that you give Stahler and Leke a position in your cabinet.  
But for the rest of the political spectrum this would be an attack on the very spirit of Sordland itself,¬†*according tot hem anyway.*¬†So expect major problems with the USP and NFP.  
I‚Äôll call this ‚Äúthe scarlet coalition‚Äù because scarlet sounds better than red.  
**Coalition stability: high + reactionary threat: high**

**-**¬†The ‚Äòdestined to fail‚Äô way: a coalition with the PFJP and the CPS/WPB. Why would you do this? Your agenda will be impossible to satisfy both sides who will be constantly bickering about everything. Atleast you have a good majority in the GNA, but don‚Äôt take their loyalty for granted. And on top of a wonky coalition, conservatives wil not be happy about the CPS/WPB in government.  
I‚Äôll call this ‚Äúthe Red bird coalition‚Äù after the PFJP‚Äôs bird.  
**Coalition stability: low + reactionary threat: middling**

¬†

\-So Anton has formed a coalition, but what next? Maintaining that coalition ofcourse. Basicly if Anton diverts to much or doesn‚Äôt keep his promises from the coalition negotiations (like being too planned econ with the PFJP) the government falls wich means you now have a minority government, a few empty cabinet spots and have lost the trust of the people.

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reactionary influence/terrorists

\-Sordlands transition to socialism will not be warmly received by large parts of the country. Like the USP/NFP and the military. Ofcourse reactionary resistance will be higher or lower depending on the coalition you chose to form.

\-The USP and the NFP will form the ‚ÄúUnited Sordish Front‚Äù even if you chose the centrist coalition. If you are extra mean to the PFJP and disrespect them enough they will join the USF, enlarging the opposition but destabilising it.

\-Now the USF is a mix of free-market capitalists and moderate reformists (Ricterists), Sollists (Lileasists) and Sordist nationalists (Kibenerists). They will do everything to undermine you and make you fail. Because in their eyes you are destroying Sordland.  
Now you can try to undermine¬†*them*, sowing distrust amongst the wings, negotiating with one wing instead of the whole USF as example. Fabricating scandals etc.

\-But outside the GNA the Young Sords are still running around and¬†*they will not be happy.*  
So why not make another terrorist group? The ‚ÄúSaviors of Sordland‚Äù has a good ring to it no? Active in Agnolia and parts of Gruni. The most ignored region and the most reactionary region respectively. Again the strenght of the SS will depend how radical your government is, but you can still expect asassinations and bombings.

3 options of resistance that depends on the coalition you picked:  
\- Agnland resistance: low, Gruni resistance: almost nonexisting  
\-AR: high, GR: middling  
\-AR: middling, GR: low

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military loyalty

Our beloved general Egg (Iosef) and the rest of the military won‚Äôt be to happy with socialist Rayne so they need to be dealt with. Now military loyalty will be naturally low at the start, the coalition you pick will only improve loyalty a little bit or decrease it a lot.

\-How do ensure their loyalty? Well we can try throwing money at the military to keep them happy but that will not work forever‚Ä¶

\-We can slowly remove anti-socialist elements/figures under the guise of ‚Äòdoctrine changes‚Äô. But be carefull! The military is not that stupid.

\-You can ‚Äòreassure‚Äô the military by letting Iosef staying as defense ministry. But he will be a pain in the ass. So manage him carefully.

\-If the military is disloyal enough they might do something ‚Äòrash‚Äô. Like supporting the reactionary SS and maybe even a coup. If you aren‚Äôt carefull enough.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†Economic stability

Sordland finds itself in a new era of prosperity. But that can‚Äôt be the case forever.  
If you make questionable economic decisions, mismanage the planned economy, if there is to much unrest economic stability will decrease. Affecting future economic projects, the Sordish budget and the welfare of the nation.

\-If Economic stability drops to much the Sordish economy will stagnate and Rayne will lose considerable support.

\-How do we prevent this? Good question I don‚Äôt really know but probably by managing the budget correctly, allocating resources correctly and staying focused on economic goals (not flip-flopping to one thing and another).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Diplomatic activeness

Sordland is now part of the CSP and posseses the largest ATO-CSP border in the world (as far as we know). Sordland has the power to become a formidable regional power, I think Sordish diplomatic power can stretch from Rumburg to Nibiya, from Morella to Agard. This presents a couple of problems and opportunities, like courting Morella to join the CSP, undermining Arcasian interests in central and southern Merkopa (Qinal and Agard) and some ‚Äònation building‚Äô in Rika. And don‚Äôt forget the growing tensions with Lespia and Agnolia.  
¬†Sordland has a few choices in the diplomatic arena, let‚Äôs go over them.

\-The sword of the CSP.  
Sordland makes strides to spread the revolution across the world!  
extensivily aiding(and influencing) Morella, Wehlen and Rikan nations to get them to join the CSP. Harrasing Lespia, Agnolia, Qinal and The Free Cities. And generally be a pain in the ass for ATO, and sometimes for United Contanta.

\-The lance of the CSP.  
Sordland will take the middle road and not upset the fragile balance¬†*too*¬†much. Still trying to expand the influence of the CSP and some mediating on the side. Also no harrasing nations.

\-The shield of the CSP.  
Sordland will avoid angering ATO and upsetting the balance in Merkopa and will be focused on strenghtening bonds with fellow CSP nations. And only partake in low risk diplomatic plans, international investment and aid. Sordland will also try to be a mediating force to prevent hostilities.

¬†

¬†

**Economic decisions, plans and opportunities**

Aright now that we have the main problems/mechanics of Rayne‚Äôs second term let‚Äôs talk about the economics!

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Economic direction.  
Now that Sordish economy operates under a planned economy the question is what to do with it? Was this the end goal or is it a stepping stone?

\-Maintain the full command economy: The least risky option, it worked so far right so why fix it? This decision will not have much effect, it‚Äôll keep people happy, the military won‚Äôt suspect anything and the economy will run¬†*fine*. As long as you don‚Äôt screw things up.  
\[economic stability decreases more with ‚Äòbad choices‚Äô\] \[the military and the USF won‚Äôt be angry¬†*as much*\]

\-Transition to a socialist market economy: Cut back state control/intervention while maintaining socialist principles and put the workers first. It will be a delicate balance but the ¬†added flexibility should be worth it. Again it is your choice how far you go with this. Will you fuck it up and create a system were the oligarchs can rise once again? Will you achieve the perfect balance of opportunity and workplace democracy? Or something in between?  
\[Economic stability will decrease less with ‚Äòbad choices‚Äô\]\[The military and the USF won‚Äôt be happy but the moderates might be surprised and warm up to you\]

\-The Valgslandian way: You‚Äôre truly the idealist aren‚Äôt you Rayne? If you do this the proletariat will love you for it, Emmerich Hegel will love you for it and LUS/the Trade Unions too. Workerplace democracy, strenghtening the unions, decentralisation. You will try to create a true socialist economy that is centered on the common worker. Increasing effiency and public opinion. But at the cost of angering the reactionaries beyond saving, if you don‚Äôt take drastic measures prepare for a¬†*significant*¬†uptick in SS activities an expect the USF and the military to openly defy you and engage with¬†*illegal activities*.  
\[Economic stability isn‚Äôt effected\]\[The military and the USF will ‚Äòdeclare war‚Äô on you\]

Economic focuses  
When I started Suzerain I was a little dissapointed with the lack of economic decisions so why not make my own? Now we have Economic directions, focuses and projects. Economic focuses are wich industry/region you want to focus on. This is quite long term so you can only pick one focus, so choose well.

\-Petrochemical expansion: Sordland has oil, gas and a very big important port. Lachaven is perfect for a large petrochemical industry. Oil refineries, gas refineries and plastic based industries. All essential to a thriving modern economy. To accomplish this huge investments are needed in Lachaven, Narbel and Estord.  
Now for a visual demonstration.  
Quick legend: Green=most economic impact/yellow= medium economic impact/Red= a little economic impact.  
Now this focus will make Lachaven even more of an economic juggernaut, and ofcourse for a petrochemical industry you need oil and gas so Narbel and Estord will also receive economic stimulation. And don‚Äôt forget that Gelsord also benefits from a strong Lachaven. Sordland will export more refined oil and plastic products in than anyone on the Merkopan continent! Exept Rizia ofcourse.  
¬†\[This focus will have greater effect if you‚Äôve invested in Gasom\]

\-Expansion of high-tech industries: ¬†We all love the Gelsord silicon valley synergy, because it‚Äôs good. So why not expand it even more? Electronics, advanced shipbuilding, advanced steelmaking, pharmaceuticals etc. With this risky and ambitious plan you will propel Sordland to new heights! And make the Sordish coast truly out of petrol, silicon and high-quality steel! Ofcourse with such a big plan you need to chose on what part you will focus the most. On Morna and Morbel steelmaking and engine factories? Or on the radio factories and the labs in Gelsord? Or on general manufacturing in Greater Holsord? Gelsord and Greater Holsord will see new heights! Lorren will also heavily benefit, after all we all need steel and engines. And ofcourse some slight positives for Lachaven and Deyr. With this plan Sordland will become one of the most technological economies in the world! Exept the superpowers ofcourse.  
\[This focus will have greater effect if you‚Äôve invested in electronic industries\]

\-Expansion of manufacturing/heavy industries: Become the workshop of the world. Why inovate if everything still works? Textiles, furniture, glass, and paper industries. A quite safe focus but should still be exremely beneficial. Primarely focused on the Greater Holsord and Lorren areas Gelsord and Lachaven should still get a boost. And expect export to explode. \[This focus has greater effect if you‚Äôve done Conriat Industrial City\]

\-Expansion of agriculture and mineral extraction: And finally some love for Bergia and Gruni. Becoming the bread basket of Merkopa will be difficult but with enough shrewd investment it should be possibe. And mineral xports are always needed. Zinc, copper, silver, iron, coal and even uranium¬†*perhaps*, are all minerals that nations pay high prices for. With this plan Gruni and Sarna will be cultivating crops wile Ribel and the south of Greater Holsord will be extracting the ground of out great nation!  
\[Investments in Gruni and Bergia will make this plan more succesfull\]

Economic projects  
These projects are like the L-1 and the Conriat industrial city projects.¬†*Relatively*¬†small in comparisons with the others. But with Sordlands economy back on track you can afford TWO projects at a time! Isn‚Äôt that amazing! These projects will have a synergy with economic focuses, other decisions and diplomatic stuffs.

\-Expansion of the L-1 railway to Morna, Conriat and Estord: Pretty self-explanitory, better rail connection equals happier citizens and economic growth. A pretty safe option and will help turn Sordlands coast into an economic powerhouse.

https://preview.redd.it/mjqrsi1w16fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=63398301c6db6f55461ee5158848a4cf7a033739

\-Expansion of L-1 railway to Deyr, Erzaren and Wizen: A plan to better connect Bergia tot he rest of Sordland. And a plan to increase connectivity with Wehlen, Smolak will love you for it but it will have diplomatic consequences, positive and negative.

https://preview.redd.it/uo4l212426fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4b6725f84d8e579af3e9c66cb835f4d5f6de823

\-Expansion of Agnland infrastructure: Finally! Somebody has not forgotten Agnland! With the revival of the H-3 project and the expansion of the L-1 railway to arvory Agnland will finally stop being a backwater! But this will not really help with the economy (except Agnland) but the people will be happy.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkqbhpe26fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c084863df4cc7f850f409a4bfea5b70305e09d

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† -Estord oil expansion: We will always need more oil so why not? And ofcourse this will work well with the petrochemical plan.

\-Gelsord inovation hub: Gelsord is already the most advanced city in Sordland, so why not take that to the next level? Also what‚Äôs with those ‚Äòrobots‚Äô I keep hearing about?

\-Ribel mining expansion: The mountains around Ribel are filled with metals and minerals, if we can expand the operations there it wouldy surely benefit us.

\-Morbel industry modernization program: upgrading those metallurgy plants and heavy transport factories will make Morbel once again the king of steel and smog in Lorren!

PS. I wanted to include a ‚Äòmake a nuclear powerplant‚Äô project but I think that‚Äôs a little far fetched, for now.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†

**Military**

¬†

¬†

It‚Äôs the military‚Äôs turn! So what‚Äôs on the agenda? Well, doctrine changes, budget changes, managing Iosef and a few more things.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Doctrine changes  
Well it‚Äôs time for a few changes in the military! War always changes so Sordland needs to get with the times. But how will Rayne achieve that? And will Rayne use this as an excuse to purge the military?  
PS. I‚Äôve just read a comment from u/jistiesep about Sordland‚Äôs miliary so I‚Äôm going to take a few things from that so thank you u/jistiesep! Also here is their comment:  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
\-The army: The doctrine of the Sordish army is severly outdated, relying on infantry assault and is full of officers like Valken. Time to change this, but how?  
  
Option 1: Do nothing, keep the old doctrine, ofcourse this will be detrimental for any future engangements but maybe you didn‚Äôt want to risk anything  
  
Option 2: Switch to ‚Äòcombined arms warfare‚Äô/more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I‚Äôm not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Iosef alligned-*mostly* moderate officers.  
\[Iosef will be happy and trust you more, military loyalty doesn‚Äôt change, the military is more *United*\]  
  
Option 3: Switch to ‚Äòcombined arms warfare‚Äô/more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I‚Äôm not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Socialist and regime-friendly officers  
\[Iosef will not be happy, military loyalty will increase, the military grows further *divided*\]  
  
Now this repeats for the air force and the navy, but what does the ‚ÄòIosef happy meter‚Äô, ‚Äòmilitary loyalty‚Äô and ‚Äòmilitary unity‚Äô mean?  
  
\-Iosef happy meter: pretty simple, if Iosef isn‚Äôt happy he will start working against you. So be nice to him, prioritise funding for his projects and give him more influence. But that can be a two bladed sword, if you give him to much influence and *then anger him* he will turn the entire military against you. And if that happens you‚Äôre fucked  
  
On the other hand if you manage things right you can deprive him of allies and isolate the Egg, without him even knowing it.  
  
\-Military loyalty: a little less simple, still basicly represents how well the military listens to you, if it is to low they will refuse to take your orders, be more likely to help your militant opposition and will coup you if they can find an authority figure to rally behind.  
  
Now how do increase loyalty? By getting socialist officers into the military ofcourse! You can try to isolate high command by replacing the lower-ranking officer corp or try to a ‚Äòquick purge‚Äô of high command under the guise of doctrine changes. Both of these have ther up- and downsides.  
  
\-Military unity: When you are trying to make the military more friendly to you by appointing socialist officers and other things you are also dividing the military politically, opening the way for infighting. This ofcourse comes with it‚Äôs own myriad of problems.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military procurement  
  
Every military needs more weapons, *new* weapons too. New armored vehicles, jet aircraft, assault rifles, missiles, helicopters, boats etc. Ofcourse there are a few things that can influence these decisions, like budget, different schools of thought and industrial/intellectual capabality.  
  
\-Budget: Pretty simple, how much will you spend on projects and the military as a whole? Granting bigger budgets will make the military happy and give better results. But if you‚Äôre too liberal with funding they may get careless and wastefull. And ofcourse you can veto the projects but that will not make the military happy.  
  
\-Different opinions: One guy thinks the new jet should prioritise guns and minimise it‚Äôs turnrate while the other guy wants to focus on the range and those new heat-seeking missiles. These ‚Äòguys‚Äô have their alignment and loyalties, choosing/supporting one guy over the other strengthens ‚Äòthat guy‚Äôs‚Äô position in the military thus increasing or decreasing Iosef‚Äôs/Old-Guard/Socialist influence.  
  
\- Industrial/intellectual capabality: Sordland is not a superpower, it still needs to buy a lot of it‚Äôs own military hardware and licenses. So it‚Äôs delusional to think that Sordland can completely design, test and produce it‚Äôs own military equipment. So you need to decide how much help you import from outside. If you import to much the military will be displeased and you will be more reliant on the CSP. On the other hand if you try to do everything on your own could compromise the quality of the equipment.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military wages and pensions  
  
Here is were the comment of u/ Domitien comes in, it boils down to the point that probably most of the military budget is used for huge military pensions and wages for officers from the Soll era. seems like an easy way to cut expenses, all those old officers and vets are almost dead anyway. But this WILL make the military angry.  
  


  
  
**Domestic stuff**

Alright, this part is about education, healtcare, dealing with the reactionary resistance, the Bludish and a few other things. So let‚Äôs start.

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Welfare state  
  
You can‚Äôt be socialist without a welfare state righ?  
Welfare state‚Äôs are popular yes but they do cost a lot so what will you do?  
  
\-Just expand on the existing structure: Nothing special, better pensions, housing assistence, unemployment subsidies etc. still quit popular and won‚Äôt cost as much.  
  
\-enlarge the welfare state substantially: Make school (almost) entirely free, implement a system that increases wages if inflation increases (Belgium style). And more.  
  
\-Make UBI a reality: Try to give everyone a garanteed wage, ofcourse you can implement in different ways. Maybe link it to the rent of an appartment, the proce of groceries or go all out so that ‚Äòin principle‚Äô no Sordish man needs to work anymore. But this will have consequences.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Healtcare  
  
\-Do you invest more into healtcare? Do you choose between removing the last differences between rural and urban hospitals? Or do you focus on advancing medical technology in the cities, leaving the countyside in the dust?  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Education  
  
\-More money for Ms Walda? Do you focus on school accessibility to destroy illiteracy or do you focus on the sciences and the universities to make Sords the smartest people in Merkopa? Again do you focus on the countryside or the cities.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Bludish  
  
\-Who can forget about the Bludish? I don‚Äôt really have an ideas about this but I guess you can focus on deradicalising the Bludish population with subsidies and stimilus packages. And officially/publically condem the Izzam incident.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Public transport  
  
very expensive project but will also make you very popular  
  
\-Light rail expansion: connect a lot of small rural towns across Sordland to the rail network. Rural population will like this.  
  
\-Metro and tram expansion: Make big cities better and more prepared for bigger populations. Urban population will like this.  
  
\-Construct a bus fleet: I don‚Äôt know if Sordland has buses but it has them now! Connect rural towns and big cities alike. Everyone likes this a little bit.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Land redistribution  
  
\-One of the central socialist policies, take land from big landowners and give it to the common farmer. Pretty simple concept. Again you decide how far you go with this. But in short small farmers like you more and the landowners don‚Äôt.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reactionary resistance  
  
\-You‚Äôre a socialist president in a socialist government in a socialist superpower bloc. People aren‚Äôt stupid, they will fight against you. The core reactionaries of the Saviours of Sordland (SS) recruit from people who are dissatisfied with your ideas and policies. People in Agnland who feel forgotten. Conservative rural people who think you‚Äôre an urban elite, Military veterans etc.  
Now it‚Äôs your job to deal with them.  
  
\-Option one: Use the military to crush the SS. Sounds straight forwrd but isn‚Äôt. I think the SAF isn‚Äôt that good in fighting guerilla warfare (evident by their inability to destroy the BFF) So it might be too difficult. So if you fail again and again the political opposition might see an opportunity.  
  
\-Option 2: Try to destroy their base. Can‚Äôt locate SS cells in Arvory because nobody gives any information because they dislike the government? Make sure you appear concerned with their problems and make sure they have food on the table with a stable job.  
  
Now you also have the Red Youth to use. These determined socialist will do about everything you ask, wether you want it or not. They can be very usefull in fighting the SS and the Young Sords but using them to much discredits your government and make you appear tyrannical. If you use them to often and give them to much resources while you aren‚Äôt socialist enough they might attempt something rash, and maybe United Contana is looking for a new arrangement too‚Ä¶  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Endgame  
  
Now this is something that just came to mind. At the end of Rayne‚Äôs second term when you have solidified socialist control over the military, significantly decreased reactionary power and created a succesfull socialist economy. You should be able to finally declare the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Socialist Democratic Republic of Sordland‚Äô or maybe you want to drop a few adjectives ¬†and just have the ‚ÄòSocialist Republic of Sordland‚Äô.  


**Diplomacy**  
  
  


Who doesn‚Äôt love diplomacy? Sordland has a lot of opportunities on the world stage. Let‚Äôs go over a few.  
  
the main focus (acording to me) would be to enlarge the CSP, Morrella and Wehlen. Creating problems for ATO, infiltrating/isolating Lespia. And while doing those things maybe gain some military, economical benefits?  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wehlen  
  
The funny man‚Äôs domain, Wehlen is a pseudo-socialist genocidal state that conveniently is anti-west and thus likes us. So why not use it to further the CSP‚Äôs and our interests?  
  
\-Give him money: just give him money, promise him investments to increase Wehlen‚Äôs wealth. You can also promise Smolak a new fancy mansion.  
  
\-Give him guns: give him weapons pretty simple.  
  
But why do this? To get Wehlen into the CSP and isolate Lespia and exert pressure on ATO in central Merkopa ofcourse.  
  
But president Smolak can be a wild card, so maybe you are planning to remove him from the picture and replace him with someone less controversial, and more loyal‚Ä¶  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Morella  
  
Morella would be the first South Merkopan nation to join the CSP and they‚Äôre actively trying to join so with an injection of a few billion Sordish Ren and military equipment they should have no problem joining the revolution!  
  
Now here is where the infiltration comes in. If you are really want to spread the revolutions you can *try* to infiltrate theses nations and fund Malyenevist groups.  
  
But don‚Äôt take it too far! You‚Äôre shenanigans can be uncovered and even United Contana will tell you too stop if you take it to far.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rumburg  
  
Honestly I don‚Äôt think Rumburg will be that much of a pain the ass. They can‚Äôt really use the BFF because you gave the Bludish rights. They can‚Äôt bully you because you‚Äôre in the CSP.  
  
But that doesn‚Äôt mean YOU can‚Äôt be a pain in the ass for THEM.  
How does it feel Beatrice when foreign powers arm terrorists who want to overthrow the government? HOW DOES IT FEEL?!!  
  
Again with enough *discreet* support you can tie down the Rumburg army and government in a guerilla war in their own country, with their own people. And we know what guerilla wars do to nations.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Agard  
  
The ATO‚Äôs very own drug-trafficing hub. Now there is a very big opportunity here to spread the revolution. Nobody in their right mind WANTS to live in a damn mafia-state so resistance movements should be plentifull.  
Now there should be few opportunities/choices for you to interfere.  
(All resistance/group names are product of my own fantasy/insanity, non are canon)  
  
\-Support the Aegardian Democrats: Centrist democratic opposition, pretty mild in their anti-establishment actions. They prefer to keep things legal in a country where laws don‚Äôt mean anything, so hopelesly naive. If you fund them enough they might be able to exercise enough power to soft-coup the narco-lord Severo Rios(head of government), leading to them cracking down on the drug trade but they will keep the ATO observer status unless you place some strings in their government.  
  
\-Support the Magka Group: A rival drug cartel that would like Rios‚Äô head on a stick. Not the nicest but an easy option to support, they‚Äôre violent and ready to shoot up Rios‚Äô palace. Now if you fund them enough they can replace Severo Rios‚Äô leading to no change or even an increase in the drug trade but if you promise the new head guy a nice mansion and enough gold toilets he will rescind that ATO observer status for you.  
  
\-Support the Fruma Guerilla‚Äôs: The hardcore Malenyevist group in Agard. With their influence concentrated around the central lake they have the advantage that they can evade government attacks quite easily. Now their military power has decreased in recent years but if manage to pump enough guns and money into them they will gladly march to Ardeal and burn the drug lords tot he ground. But beware, ATO WILL notice that a waning guerilla army has just out of nothing gained traction again. So thread carefully.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Free Cities  
  
A Dastnurity confederacy that‚Äôs buddies with Arcasia and also rich with tourist money. Now I imagine TFC is quite a stable country so no revolution possible. But you can pull some strings.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Jathlas‚Äô Federalists: An upcoming movement that calls for more integration and for an even closer relationship with ATO. Now you can plant some agents, create corruption scandals, leak those scandals. If you‚Äôre succesfull you can kill the movement before it can seize control.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Confederate Dastnuritists: The embodiment of the status quo in TFC. still this presents an opportunity, if you empower them enough you can a political deadlock between them and the Federalists. And you can also pull a few strings, maybe prevent that third ATO base in the south?  
  
\-Support the Golcondist insurgents: Pro Derdian Golcondists who want to reach Golconda by making life hell for TFC. So why not help them? If you‚Äôre succesfull enough they will tie down quite a bit of ATO resources, for a few years at least.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Qinal  
  
Aaah‚Ä¶ ATO‚Äôs main partner in Xina, and one that openly defied Arcasia in the past. They are on good terms right now but maybe we can dig up those tensions somehow?  
  
\-Support the Qinali Liberal Party: Contrary tot heir name the QLP are on the right part of the Qinali political spectrum, the *far* right. They champion Qinaly exceptionalism, independence from foreign influence and economic statism. At this point they are a small faction in parlement but a loud one. With some extra funds they will do better but if you manage to dig up/fabricate another PMC scandal the QLP will surge in popularity, and with those elections coming up‚Ä¶  
  
\-Support the Qinali Unbowed Party: A new small extraparlementary party trying to present a left alternative to the ruling coalition. Now they aren‚Äôt Malenyevist or even socialist but they are friendlier and more open to other ‚Äòvieuwpoints‚Äô. Now if you manage to get them into parlement they *maybe* can get in a coalition as a minor partner. Perhaps not that effective at fighting ATO‚Äôs influence but it‚Äôs a nice foundation to build upon.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lespia  
  
Lespia, who doesn‚Äôt hate that drunk son of a bitch Alvarez? I imagine two ways you can go about dealing with them.  
  
\-The agressive way: Start by sending agents into Lespian cities and the country side, identify people and groups who are willing to ‚Äòcooperate‚Äô and ‚Äòpresent an alternative‚Äô to the status quo. Arm them, drill them. Spy on the government and the military.  
And when the Lespian status quo starts to fall and Alvarez‚Äô control starts to slip, use them to burn the bourgois to the ground.  
  
\-The diplomatic way: The world is one misfire from a Sordish/Lespian rifle away from nuclear hellfire. So inflating tensions might not bet he best idea. So organize a few diplomatic visits, maybe sign some token demiliterization agreements. So when that spark inevitable sets Perla on fire the Lespian government trusts you and are willing to cooperate more.  
  
Apart from that you can park a naval fleet *just* outside their territorial waters or fly an airplane in to their airspace. Basicly intimidation attemps and being a real asshole for ATO. But this does not come without consequences, a lot of nations will see you raising tensions needlessly and they won‚Äôt be happy.  
  
  
  


¬†

**Diplomatic crisis**

We all know that Sordland‚Äôs population is *weird*, really 37 million? Rizia has 40 million Lespia has 60 million for god‚Äôs sake. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. So I though up an in-universe explanation.  
  
Basicly the repression of the Sordish King, the instability of the first republic, the civil war and the Soll stagnation caused a shit ton of Sords to emigrate. Hence the low population. And here is the seed of a diplomatic crisis that will almost lead to war.  
  
Now that Sordland is in a better state president Rayne will seek to bring these people back to Sordland. So he basicly says to the world: ‚ÄúIf you are a Sord In Lespia, Agnolia, Valgsland etc. Come back! We have a big stimulus, house and a job to give you!‚Äù. Now I estimate that around 2,5 million Sords live abroad, most of them in Lespia serving as cheap labor. So when these underpaid underappreciated (probably target of racism) hear that they can go back to their home country for a better life they will drop everything and go. But you know Lespians, they love their cheap labor! So they prevent them from leaving so the Sords protest the government wich leads to a riot wich leads to the police fireing on the Sordish protestors. Wich causes national outrage and within a week the streets of Perla and Falenco are on fire, major protests erupting across the country, The Sordish protestors are now joined by lower class Lespians who want an end to the inequality.  
  
Now it‚Äôs YOUR job to react to this. Your largest rival is on fire, activily murdering your people and their own too. So what do you do?  
  
\-Ramp up funding for revolutionary groups to destabilise Lespia even more, making Alvarez even more desperate, making him more likely to accept terms.  
  
\-Deploy the military to DEMAND that Lespia allow all Sords to safely leave the country, and if they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
  
\-Use diplomacy, try to get the rest of ATO and the AN to agree with you demands.  
  
Ofcourse you can use a combination of all of these to get your way. But if this little crisis last to long it will grow out of control. Lespia is teetering on the edge of a cliff so ATO is **desperate** to prevent a revolution. While this is happening both the SAF and the LAF (Lespian Armed Forces) are staring eachother down at the border, opening the possibility of ‚Äòincidents‚Äô that can escalate the crisis into a full blow war. And if that happens you‚Äôre in big trouble. Again you‚Äôre *one misfire* away from nuclear hellfire, don‚Äôt forget that.

  
  
  
  
**Conclusion**

¬†

Alright, now I would like to hear your critisisms on my medieval scroll-sized post.  
Eventually I will make an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô epilogue for Red Sunrise over Sordland.  
And know that I think about it I may just make an in-dept post about the Lespia crisis, and find a better name for it. I‚Äôm open to suggestions!

I am having a hard time getting into the Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman but I still would like to check out a Dark Fantasy/Horror book. Can anyone please give me additional recommendations?,horrorlit,1i9q7vg,2025-01-25 11:08:38,7,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/1i9q7vg/i_am_having_a_hard_time_getting_into_the/,suchascenicworld,Recommendation Request,"So, I just picked up the Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman. I did this because I wanted to expose myself to more dark fantasy/horror novels and not only have I heard good things about the book, but I also really enjoyed Between Two Fires. 

I am not as familiar with high fantasy compared to other genres and have only read Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit, The Book of Lost Things, and A Song of Ice and Fire (all of the released ones at least). Anyways, I absolutely adored all of these books and because of that, I wanted to expand my horizons so to speak! 

I am about 90 pages in The Blacktongue Thief and I am struggling with this book. I know this book is loved by plenty of people and I absolutely can understand that, but it feels a bit ""off"" for me.  I guess what I mean by that is that it feels like an edgy D&D Campaign or something out of a Ren Faire and that wasn't really what I was hoping to read. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with either of those things (my partner and I even go the Ren Faire once a year and make quite a big deal about it!) but because of that, I had a hard time and its not something I am looking for in a book. 

I think what I enjoyed (and kept me glued) To A Song of Ice and Fire is that the writing felt more historical-fiction and had a more serious tone. I also enjoyed the world-building in those books (some of the best I ever read). The Blacktongue Thief doesn't really give me that same sense of awe because it feels a bit ""on the nose"" with that D&D Campaign aspect that I brought up. With that being said, would anyone have other recommendations? I still want to get into this genre, but I am not sure if I can finish this book. 

Other books mentioned by this sub include Aching God by Mike Shel, The Darkness That Comes Before: The Prince of Nothing by R Scott Baker, and Empire of the Vampire by Jay Kristoff. Given what I mentioned, do you think I might have a better time with one of these books instead? Likewise, do you have your own recommendation?

  
Thank you! 

  
TLDR: Didn't Enjoy Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman because it reminded me too much of D&D but still want to check out a dark/horror fantasy novel and looking for recommendations. "

Choose your Legends is the talk of the town! The proverbial town that is the FE fandom. Naturally, all eyes are on the top spots. After all, they're the ones that get in the game, the ones that get cool new artwork, the ones that *matter*!

However, I humbly believe there may be value in stepping away from all that noise and taking a moment to observe the most maligned members of this series's large, sprawling cast of anime faces. After all, where there's a top, there has to be a bottom. That's just science!

If you have a keen memory, you may notice I have shamelessly recycled this opening from the similar post I made last year. In fact, a large chunk of the post is the same, just with the CyL 8 results added as well. However, last time, I only went over the absolute losest of losers. The last-ranking character in each year, and the last-ranking playable when the former wasn't one. This time around, I have gone back and reviewed each year's bottom 3. There are some interesting things to see there, as well!

So, without further ado! For those among you who are curious, this is the list of grand winners of the bottom-of-the-barrel award thus far, with short descriptions in case anyone's not familiar with these fine, fine gentlemen (and gentlewoman):

*CyL 1:* [**Glade**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/b/b6/Portrait_glade_fe05.png), with 17 votes. Actually semi-noteworthy Thracia 776 character, but this was before Thracia had a tolerable translation and he's not a flashy man, so he stands out less. [Also they couldn't make up their minds what his hair's supposed to look like.](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/5/59/FE776_Glade.png)

Second-to-last: [Danann](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/6/68/Portrait_danann_fe04.png), final boss (of FE4 chapter 6), and [Bloom](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/c/ca/Portrait_bloom_fe04.png), least interesting House Friege member, at 18 votes.  
Third-to-last: [Macellan](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/8/8d/Portrait_dolph_fe01.png), bad prison knight (pink), at 19 votes.

*CyL 2:* Tie between [**Bloom**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/c/ca/Portrait_bloom_fe04.png) and [**Garth**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/4/47/Portrait_garth_fe02.png) at 7 votes. Bloom is a moderately major boss from Genealogy's second part. He's beyond generic, gets overshadowed by his wife, his daughter and even his father and has an ugly butt chin. Garth is a generic pirate from Gaiden.

*Playable*: [**Hicks**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/8/8b/Portrait_hicks_fe05.png), at 8 votes. A cool dad and axe knight from Thracia 776 carrying a much coveted halberd right before the perfect chapter to put it to good use. I love him, he's great, one of my FE5 favorites. A character I quite like.

Second-to-last (not counting Hicks): [Beck](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/b/ba/Portrait_beck_fe11.png), ballistician and part-time horse-speaker, and [Amid](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/1/15/Portrait_amid_fe04.png), green mage copy of a green mage copy, at 13 votes.  
Third-to-last (not counting Hicks): Danann, at 14 votes.

*CyL 3:* [**Frost**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/0/08/Portrait_frost_fe12.png), at 11 votes. Archanea's best grandpa. [I wrote a whole essay about him for the last CyL and I'm going to shamelessly recycle it for this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/107qflt/frost_family_man/) And probably the next one. And the year after! Never stop the Frost machine! Needless to say, another character I quite like.

Second-to-last: Danann, at 16 votes.  
Third-to-last: Halcyon, at 18 votes.

*CyL 4:* Tie between [**Dalvin**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/0/09/Portrait_dalvin_fe04.png), [**Hayden**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/1/13/Portrait_hayden_fe08.png) and [**Halcyon**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/2/20/Portrait_halcyon_fe02.png), at 11 votes. Dalvin is a Genealogy gen 2 substitute unit that probably has a personality (I actually had him in my army in my FE4 run, but... yeah). Hayden is the king of Frelia in Sacred Stones and technically playable in the Creature Campaign, but who uses him over all the actually cool bonus units? Halcyon is a bad recolor of Nomah and NPC in Gaiden.

Second-to-last: [Hetzel](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/f/f5/Portrait_hetzel_fe10.png), actually really interesting antagonist from RD; [Daniel](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/1/18/Portrait_daniel_fe09.png), shopkeep twin who unlike his brother hasn't lost CyL or gotten into Heroes; and [Izuka](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/6/67/Small_portrait_izuka_fe10.png), *mad doktor*, at 12 votes.  
Third-to-last: [Jerome](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/9/92/Portrait_jerome_status_fe15.png), uhhhhhh, and [Veld](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/3/33/Portrait_veld_fe05.png), final boss (like actually, just the final boss of a game) at 13 votes.

*CyL 5:* Tie between [**Alder**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/e/ef/Portrait_alder_fe10.png) and [**Dolth**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/b/b5/Portrait_dolth_fe02.png), at 2 votes. Alder is a NPC in Radiant Dawn that actually has a kinda interesting dynamic with Jarod, the main villain of part 1. Dolth is a recolored bossman from Gaiden. At least they bothered to recolor him, unlike Jedah and his two twins.

*Playable*: [**Yoder**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/b/b0/Portrait_yoder_fe06.png), at 6 votes. The pope of Elibe's Church of St. Elimine and wielder of a hat to match fellow pope Windell. Like all FE6 characters, doomed to be a really interesting and surprisingly deep character, but it's all locked behind FE6's impossibly slow supports. Another character I quite like.

Second-to-last: Danann, at 3 votes.  
Third-to-last: [Lekain](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/4/4c/Portrait_lekain_fe10.png), corrupt politician with the cool stache, tied with Yoder at 6 votes

*CyL 6:* [**Jorge**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/9/92/Portrait_jorge_02_fe10.png), at 6 votes. He's in a group of four minor NPC shopkeep characters and he's the least memorable of all of them. He got botted to the top for nebulous reasons I forget, then proceeded to lose miserably when the botting stopped. Amazing.

*Playable*: Tie between [**Hermina**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/3/3c/Portrait_hermina_fe04.png) and [**Leiden**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/f/f4/Portrait_reiden_fe12.png), at 8 votes. Hermina appears in Genealogy gen 2 as the substitute of pegasus knight Fee. They're literally the same character and design because pegasus knights are made on a conveyor belt. Leiden is one of three identical men with unmatched drip from BSFE. Seriously look at that jacket, I want one of those. Another character I quite like.

Second-to-last: [Desmond](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/9/9a/Portrait_desmond_fe07.png), winner of every bad dad award ever; Garth, [Lundgren](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/5/57/Portrait_lundgren_fe07.png), winner of every bad uncle award ever; and Jerome, at 7 votes.  
Third-to-last: Danann, tied with Hermina and Leiden at 8 votes.

*CyL 7:* **Alder** again with a single vote. Wow.

*Playable*: **Dalvin** again with 5 votes. What a boring year this was.

Second-to-last: Veld and Lundgren, at 3 votes.  
Third-to-last: [Numida](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/2/23/Portrait_numida_fe10.png), the man with the unfortunate mustache; and Desmond, 4 votes. Dalvin actually beats both of these, hanging out with Danann, Garth and Lord Arundel instead.

*CyL 8:* [**Muston**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/d/de/Portrait_muston_fe09.png)**,** with a single vote. In my opinion, the coolest member of the Tellius vendor four. Just because of the awesome design. Look at that cool beard!

*Playable:* [**Roberto**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/d/d0/Portrait_roberto_fe12.png) and [**Dice**](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/5/51/Portrait_dice_fe12.png), at 3 votes. Roberto is one of three identical men with unmatched drip from BSFE. Seriously look at that jacket, I want one of those. As for Dice, he's a ludopathic viking with an occasional philosophical streak and father to Malice, by far and away the most popular character in BSFE. Her, not him, obviously.

Second-to-last: [Bertram](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/1/11/Medium_portrait_bertram_fe09.png), possessed mustache man #2; Danann, [Tatarrah](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/7/78/Portrait_tatarrah_fe15.png), who possesses little girls; and Garth, tied with Roberto and Dice at 3 votes.  
Third-to-last: [Tomas](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/7/74/FETH_Tomas.png), old man who doesn't exist; [Scipio](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/2/2f/Portrait_scipio_fe04.png), *not* the guy who was in that one cool cutscene from FE4; Daniel, [Gwendal](https://cdn.fireemblemwiki.org/5/5d/Medium_portrait_gwendal_fe16.png), paragon of knighthood (for all the good it did him); Jorge and Dolth, at 4 votes.

So, what does the additional data tell us? Well... Primarily, that nobody likes the generic bossmen that they added for no apparent reason. Although, some of these are actually pretty major villains in their games (seriously Veld I get but what the heck is Lekain doing there in CyL 5?). A couple of CyL 8's runner-ups, in particular, are just alternate versions of other characters who are also votable in their main incarnation, such as Bertram, who is just Renning, and Tomas, who is not a character and the ""Tomas"" we meet is some other guy that's barely a character (he got a whole 7 more votes than Tomas!). I guarantee you if they put more generic bosses like Sigune they'd get more votes, but instead we get Danann. Okay.

Speaking of him, there is one really interesting observation to make with the guy: Danann has been second or third-to-last nearly every single year (except, oddly enough, for CyL 4, where he got a humongous 136 votes and escaped from the last results page for whatever reason), but he has *not* managed to lose yet. He's just good enough to avoid the dubious honor... or perhaps he's just so bad, he's bad even at being bad!

Among playables, FE4's gen 2 subs are the runner-ups to BSFE, which solidifies its position as the grand champion of losers. After last year, all but two of its exclusive characters have made the bottom (or, at the very least, bottom among playables). Malice is a pipe dream - and I'm okay with that, I love her too - but surely we can reunite Belf with his pals one of these years, right?

And now, to close the post, a humble request: **You there!** Yes, you, the ones who give all your votes to the same pretty boy/girl that can actually vie for 1st! At the top, seven or six votes is but a drop in the ocean. At the bottom, even just one vote can mean the difference between last and second-to-last.

Let us avoid a boring year of repeat losers! I beg of you to spare one of your remaining votes to some of last year's losers, or to the recurring faces in the podium of shame. Together we can make this a truly special year with an all-new cast at the bottom of the barrel! Together we can finally get Danann there, or perhaps instead repeat the CyL 4 miracle! All it takes is a handful of votes. Vote to make a difference! Vote Muston for CyL 9!"

Jeg har gitt opp Helse-Norge og er genuint redd for konsekvensene. Noen tips?,norge,1i9ma0i,2025-01-25 07:50:50,73,0.7,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/1i9ma0i/jeg_har_gitt_opp_helsenorge_og_er_genuint_redd/,jklolljhhuio,Diskusjon,"Jeg er s√•kalt motvillig mottaker av trygd. Jeg har aldri √∏nsket √• f√• penger av staten og har alltid √∏nsket √• jobbe.

Da jeg var 8 √•r p√• 90 tallet ble jeg som s√• mange andre sunne friske gutter p√•st√•tt syke med en sykdom de kalte ADHD. Jeg var alltid imot diagnosen og senere utredninger viser at jeg ikke har sykdommen og med dagens teknologi kan de utf√∏re en slags talbakedatert utredning ved √• intervjue voksne folk som var rundt meg p√• denne tiden, samt min beskrivelse av tiden og de vanlige sp√∏rsm√•l i en typisk utredning.

Denne feildiagnosen ble min bane. De sier at ""ingen tvinge i deg f√∏rste rusen."" Vel, jeg var 8 eller ni. Verbalt og fysisk imot medisinen jeg fikk. Ikke fordi jeg viste at det var rusmidler da, men fordi jeg som barn ikke mente jeg hadde en hjerneskade (ADHD). Noe mange var enig i. 
Men dopet ble tr√∏kt ned i halsen p√• meg og jeg opplevde for f√∏rste gang det jeg trodde var lykke. Det var amfetaminrus.

Over √•rene tok jeg medisin. Med en og annen rusopplevele. Men ble forsikret om at dette kunne ikke ha med medisinen √• gj√∏re da en med ADHD ikke kunne ruse seg p√• disse medisinene.

Vel. Det var medisinene.

F√∏r rusen tok meg ved ett uhell som 13√•ring, ved min egen feilforskrevet medisin, hadde bivirkningene av amfetamin allerede √∏delagt meg. Jeg spiste ikke mat. Jeg veide 40 kg. Som en 176 (da) h√∏y gutt i pubertet. Total√∏deleggende. De valgte √• fortsette meg p√• medisinen.

Jeg bestemte meg en dag for √• ta dobbel dose da jeg ikke merket stor forskjell p√• den dosen jeg sto p√• og ingenting, mens alle mente medisinen virket. Eneste virkning var det nevnt over. Bivirkning. Alikevell. Ingen s√• dette. (Husk at hele veien her s√• har jeg faktisk ikke ADHD.)

Jeg ble ruset. Koblet det ikke. Men koblet energien som kom. Og at jeg ikke var deprimert lenger. Noe som jeg hadde v√¶rt i tre √•r allerede.

Etter to tre ganger og litt h√∏yere dose av min egen medisin, en medisin som ikke skulle v√¶rt i huset. En medisin som i fem √•r sto de der f√∏r jeg som 13 √•ring eksperimenterte. En medisin jeg ikke ville ha i huset.
Men ja jeg tok mer enn jeg skulle.

To √•r frem i tid. Familien er oppl√∏st. Ikke fordi det var noe s√¶rlig tr√∏bbel. Men fordi jeg n√• var s√• avhengig av min egen medisin som jeg fortsatt fikk, at jeg var blitt avhengig. Jeg ble nektet ungdom og VGS. 
Ikke fordi jeg var voldelig eller noe. Fordi jeg ikke passet inn. Hva gjorde l√¶rerne. Vel det var de som istedetfor √• tilrettelegge. Snudde ryggen.

S√• er det barnevernsinstitusjonene. Sett Bast√∏y? Tror du det er gammelt? ""Med tvang skal vondt fordrives"" p√• NRK. 

S√• i.o.m at bla.a v√•re menneskerettigheter var totalt oversett i disse f√¶le barnevernsinstitusjonene (alt er dokumentert) s√• tenkte vi at kanskje vi kan klage. Klage p√• det at vi uten dom og annet enn indre problemer ble tatt ut av samfunnet. Klage p√• at vi ble nektet hjelp, skolegang, at vi ble sl√•tt, sparket, lurt i feller seksuelt, truet med √• m√•tte tilbringe uker i isolat og faktisk tilbringe dagevis p√• isolat for √• ha albuene p√• bordet osv. 
Ren mishandling. Alt vi mistet er de viktigste √•rene og det vi ble frar√∏vet av l√¶re er ting som kunne hjulpet oss √• overleve senere i livet. Du vet.. utdannelse osv. 
Men uansett vi fikk blankt nei. 
Denne institusjonen som ikke var den verste engang. Vakke ille nok m√•ten de √∏dela meg p√•.

Greit nok. Klagen til helse s√∏r-√∏st p√• feilmedisinering og feildiagnostisering var ikke benekter eller noe. Dette var vanlig praksis og jeg f√•r avslag p√• bakgrunn av det. Fri rettshjelp har man ikke. Jeg er i praksis rettsl√∏s. De som hjalp meg var gatejuristen men de kan ikke ta det videre n√•r helse sier fuck deg og livet ditt til meg.

Alt dette har f√∏rt til at jeg er mer syk enn vanlig. Jeg bare g√•r i spiral nedover. Jeg har ventet p√• psykiatrisk hjelp i fem √•r n√•. Og er livredd jeg mister det snart. Er 34 fuckings √•r. Jeg har kjempet hjert sekund men jeg er der n√• at jeg f√∏ler ett hat mot systemet og heier p√• enhver person som skader systemet. Og det f√∏les som selvforsvar det er det verste av alt. Og jeg er livredd at jeg vil ende som en bad guy. For det er jeg ikke.

De mener jeg ikke kan jobbe. Jeg har jobbet √•revis frivillig n√•. De bare overser det. Jeg har drevet en kaf√© for innvandrere som ikke snakker norsk. Det er likesom....  som om jeg er d√∏mt til √• bare bli oversett. Og det morra mi, hu som den tyrannen hun er stoler p√• de istedet for meg. 

Har pr√∏vd alt n√•. Jeg er kjempesyk og jeg trenger hjelp. Omsorgsvikten av meg er godt dokumentert."

For kontekst: Jeg er en mand p√• 26 √•r,   
Desv√¶rre oplever jeg n√¶sten hver m√•ned at blive r√•bt af p√• en eller anden m√•de- hvor jeg ikke udviser nogen form for provokation.  
og alene i √•r har jeg haft to ret voldsomme oplevelser ‚Äì den ene for under en time siden.  
  
Jeg var ved at krydse en fodg√¶ngerovergang, da en bilist n√¶sten k√∏rte mig ned, da han k√∏rte alt for hurtigt, og stoppede en meter fra mig. Af ren forskr√¶kkelse rakte jeg ham fingeren (hvilket jeg indr√∏mmer nok ikke var det smarteste at g√∏re). Det resulterede i, at han k√∏rte op ved siden af mig og blokerede min vej. Jeg havde h√∏retelefoner p√• og h√∏rte ikke det hele, men da jeg tog dem ud, sagde han direkte: *""Din b√∏sser√∏v, skal jeg komme ud og smadre dig? Skal du ned i bagagerummet?""*

Den anden episode var fuldst√¶ndig uprovokeret. Jeg kom g√•ende fra en HT-station og kom √•benbart til at kigge lidt for l√¶nge p√• en bil, hvilket fik f√∏reren til at dytte af mig. Han stoppede bilen, rullede vinduet ned og r√•bte: *""Hvad er dit problem, bro? Skal jeg nakke dig?""*  


Er det bare mig, eller er det blevet mere almindeligt at opleve den slags?"

Comment 'link please' so i can send it to you please review in the comments of this post!

Significant Changes:

* I've opted for a chronological order starting the wedding massacre and the villians going in chronological order (O-Ren, Vernita, Budd, Elle and Bill).
* Removed the bleeping of the Bride's name
* Buck, Larry Gomez and Esteban's scenes are removed. They serve no purpose (Buck's scene is overly cruel - the deadly vipers are enough villians, Esteban and Larry Gomez expand both Budd and Bill's characters but aren't necessary.
* Colored house of blue leaves fight and some extended/alternate shots.
* I was going to add the ""Damoe"" deleted scene but it came off as quite cartoonish compared to the other more serious martial arts scenes
* I edited it as if Sofie gave Bill and the deadly viper's locations to The Bride after the house of blue leaves fight.
* The Cinemassacre video is what inspired me to give my own take on Kill Bill as one feature film.
* The wedding scene is the right place to start as it's what starts the events of the film."

Theory: Everyone who hates Stannis is a reasonable person and hates him for being neither a rightful nor good king yet rides the high horse.  [Spoilers Extended],asoiaf,1i9l6sw,2025-01-25 06:39:52,100,0.63,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i9l6sw/theory_everyone_who_hates_stannis_is_a_reasonable/,situmaimesdemain,EXTENDED,"**Stannis is NOT a moral man**

1- When we are first introduced to him, we see him treat Maester Cressen like shit. Maester Cressen did nothing but serve and love Stannis. Even if he preferred Melisandre's advice over him, did he really have treat him that way? Have him be a laughingstock and eventually be killed in front of everyone? Question is rhetorical as answer is obviously no. He didn't have to. He's just a dick.

2-Kills his little brother. I have no problem with a claimant killing another claimant actually. It is the way it is. Problem is Stannis acts as if he did it for rightful reasons like protecting the realm or him being the rightful ruler etc. Reality? Reach+Stormlands was an unstoppable force within normal circumstances. He was going to remove Lannisters with ease and then Robb would just bend the knee and go home. Order restored. War ended. Countless tragedies avoided. But no, Stannis had to use his deus ex machina to kill his little bro because he is ""the rightful king"".

Not that I believe in ""the rightful king"", but is he even that? Targaryen line is alive at that point with Viserys across the sea. And while he may (rightfully) believe that Cersei's kids are bastards, that is just words. Unless Melisandre conjured a DNA test kit, having kids with your own hair color isn't a crime and legally, the rightful king is Joffrey the Magnanimous.

Again, I don't blame him for killing Renly. I blame him for killing Renly and lying about the reasons. He just wants power and respect that was denied to him his all life. No one naturally respects him because he has negative charisma so he wants to be in a position he will rectify that. Cool motive, still murder.

3- Honestly I'm bored now. Trying to impose a exotic human sacrificing religion on a very religious country(recipe for disasters), trying to kill his nephew so hard that his hand has to smuggle the kid at night etc etc. You do the rest. Stannis straight up sucks and I'm tired of pretending he isn't."

Streamer CS Streamer LX5 (2013) bought used for 1500, about 2 days of work getting it shiny again and the frets dressed. All Bartolini inside, 59Js and a XTCT. Super fat and crispy.

Elrick Evo standard, bought new in 2022, Swamp Ash and super direct, punches thru the mid.

Teambuilt Thumb 5 (2022), also used, 1400 from Japan, the wood glue on the body parts came apart hence the price, Warwick replaced the body for free!

De kedelige fakta 
12 mdr gammel
Sover en lur p√• 2-3 timer indtil kl 14.30-15
Hun vil/kan ikke l√¶gges til en formiddagslur.
Hun sover omkring kl 19-6, oftest 10,5-11,5 time om natten (v√•genperioder er ikke trukket fra)
Alts√• sammenlagt 12,5-14,5 time I d√∏gnet, oftest i den lavere ende

Hun har altid lagt i den lave ende af den anbefalede s√∏vnm√¶ngde for et givent alders trin.

Vi er pt i en fase, hvor hun v√•gner et sted ved 3-4 tiden og er v√•gen i en time ish f√∏r hun kan falde til ro igen. I nat tog det endda to timer fra kl 2-4.

Godt nok er hun ved at f√• kindt√¶nder, men det synes jeg viser sig p√• anden vis i hendes nattes√∏vn med gr√•d og sm√• opv√•gninger, hvor det er tydeligt, at det g√∏r ondt.

Men denne l√¶ngere opv√•gning virker for mig som et forskud p√• 18mdrs s√∏vn regression, hvor de angiveligt (hvad ved jegü§™) er v√•gen et par timer eller tre om natten, bare fordi. Hun pludrer og leger med sine sutter indtil hun p√• et tidspunkt falder i s√∏vn igen. 

G√•r jeg ud af rummet, gr√¶der hun. 
Tager vi hende med i vores seng, er hun v√•gen lige s√• l√¶nge.

Vi pr√∏ver alle de s√¶dvanlige kneb. Ny ble, musik, vand, sang, white noise, prikken eller agen p√• ryggen, nusse h√•ret osv.

S√• hvad g√∏r vi? Er det ren overlevelse for en stund eller kan der v√¶re en konstruktiv l√∏sning p√• problemet?

Det p√•virker jo ogs√• hendes formiddage i dagplejen, hvor hun n√¶rmest falder i s√∏vn siddende i l√∏bet af formiddagen.

Vi har overvejet at bede dagplejer om at sk√¶re hendes lur til 2 timer i en periode, for at se an om det har en effekt og hun s√• sover bedre om natten."
