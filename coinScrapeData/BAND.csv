I am pissed at surgeon.,foreskin_restoration,1i9xfla,2025-01-25 16:23:18,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/1i9xfla/i_am_pissed_at_surgeon/,Art3r,Introductions,"Greetings.

Welp. I had moderate case of phimosis and frenulum brevum. It was annoying. Went to urologist. He passed me to surgery. Now I know that I was probably not even necessary as I later learned about those whole stretching thing. Anyway, instead of preputioplasty they did circumcision. I even have prepuce plasty in info card about procedure.

I did not notice immediately thanks to swelling. I don't really miss frenulum. It was too sensitive in my case. To the point that even touching it was unpleasant and it had precancerous changes so it would probably have to go at some point anyway. Frenum band? Never really noticed particular difference at this fragment in comparison to nearby parts so meh.  Foreskin? Here I am pissed. I went from something around CI-9,5/RCI-9 to CI-4,5/RCI-5 I guess. 

  
My goal is to get back to around CI-7,5/RCI-7. I don't think that I care enough to get more back but full coverage when flacid is must for me.

So I will begin journey shortly. I have no idea how long it will be but it's nice that it's at least possible. I at least have a bit of headstart compared to some. I wonder how long it will take for my goal."

Take your money and treat it like votes. Every purchase is a vote for the CEO and a vote for the practice. In an raging capitalistic society, Our money is our power even if we have very little of it. 

Our labor is also our power but admittedly its much more difficult to manage in this respect so the focus being on what you buy is an easy entry level way to help change the world. Instead of buying steak from walmart or a grocery chain maybe give a local butcher a try. Instead of using amazon, try ebay or craigslist. 

This also includes the more basic of us who ""superchat"" streamers and influencers. Especially the lonely of us who give money to onlyfans and the such. These ""workers"" may start out apart of us but most become the problem when they do not give back enough. 

This strategy is a net negative for your convenience and in some cases costs you more money than it otherwise would have but if enough people band together it will shake the economy.

Sidenote:

I define rich as having more than $750,000 to your name/estate. If you achieve more than this, You are now hoarding and are now part of the problem. As such my votes will no longer go to you. I will seek out others whom I will get my food, entertainment, and other. At 750K, They should be taking on non-cost effective projects that ultimately benefit the world. Animal sanctuaries, Clean up initiatives, Public outreach, etc. Pay others to make the world a better place."

I track my symptoms and hrv with the Visible app and use the tracking/pacing band any time I‚Äôm planning to be out of bed. (I‚Äôm home bound in bed or on the sofa 98% of the time.)

Today my local yarn store is having a customer appreciation day. I love this store. I have a credit to spend and I wanted to see the employees bc I enjoy chatting with them and other customers. 

My daughter usually drives me there and helps me reach things since using my wheelchair makes me short. She was busy with her own plans and I decided to go by myself. 

Did I mention there is also about 4‚Äù of snow on the ground and it‚Äôs still snowing? It‚Äôll be fine‚Ä¶ 

It wasn‚Äôt fine. My wheelchair couldn‚Äôt make it thru the snow in the parking lot to get thru the alley to the store. So I decided to move the car to the main street- tried again. This time got stuck in the snow on the sidewalk. 

I managed to eventually get thru to the shop door but my tires slipped at the doorway, making it almost impossible to push open the door. But I got inside and started looking at yarn for a future project. I found this really nice lace weight yarn in a great color. 

But at this point, my watch alert is buzzing because my heart rate is too high. I‚Äôm trying to decide what to do about it- ignore? 

I head toward the back of the store to check out the trunk show items. Watch is still alerting me to stop what I‚Äôm doing. So I look and my heart rate (seated doing nearly nothing) is 115. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed but I know I need to lay down right now. So I get out of my chair and lay on the floor hoping I‚Äôve found a good place where I won‚Äôt inconvenience others. Alarm stops. Check heart rate- -89. I wait a while longer- 88. I try sitting up - 112. I lay back down. Repeat a few times. 

In the meantime I have a nice chat with a customer about his hat and a current project, the yarn at the trunk show, etc. another customer walks by and asks, POTS? Yes. She nods knowingly. 

Eventually I give up and call my daughter to come get me. I‚Äôm home back in bed now. LC is just so stupid. 

TL/DR: tried to leave the house. Didn‚Äôt go well. F this sh*t

I'm pretty bad at selling myself, but I think that's what you're supposed to do when looking for a potential partner. Here's the thing: I'm getting older, and honestly would like to settle down and start a family. This isn't something that can be done quickly or haphazardly. I've had my share of relationships that I thought would last ""forever,"" and certainly didn't (apparently through no fault of my own), but I was always the one getting dumped. Common denominator, right? Anyways, here's some stuff about me so you can decide if you want to waste your time.

Looks: 6'4, a little chubby, but losing weight. Long black hair, beard, brown eyes, glasses. 3 tattoos. Usually wearing beanies, fashion sense hasn't really evolved beyond band tees, hoodies and jeans. I wear the occasional button down.

Interests:

* Music. I play guitar and bass and write my own music (very slowly). Favorite bands include, but are not limited to: BILMURI, Dance Gavin Dance, Coheed and Cambria, Streetlight Manifesto, Explosions in the Sky, Vulfpeck, Ren, the Wonder Years, and many more

* Reading. I prefer fantasy and horror. Am very into anything by Brandon Sanderson, the Dresden Files, and most Stephen King stuff.

* Cooking. I cook for work, and also like to cook in my spare time. But cooking for myself feels pretty lame sometimes.

* Video games. Favorite series are Final Fantasy, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil. Other favorite games include XCOM, PlateUp!, Hearthstone, and Stardew Valley

* Pro Wrestling. Yeah, I know it's silly, but I've been into it since I was a kid

Other things about me:

* ADHD as hellll. Working on getting it under control, hopefully through medication

* In therapy for negative self talk/views. I have had several (albeit very weak) suicide attempts in the past, and ended up voluntarily committing myself to a mental hospital for a bit. It was a good idea.

* 2 cats, Merry and Pippin

* Kinda clingy, kinda anxious. I know that can be a turnoff for some, and I try hard to control it, but that's just the way I am. This is also due to some of my past relationships

I've been told I'm an amazing partner, but the circumstances were always wrong. I'd like to have the right circumstances, y'know? Anyways, if you got this far, send me a chat. It'd be nice to hear from you. I hope you all find what you're looking for. Have a good night!"

Snug UB: 42.5 in

Tight UB: 40 in

Standing Bust: 47.5 in

Leaning Bust: 49 in

Laying Bust: 47 in


This resulted in a 42DDD (E) suggested size. Now, I have been wearing aerie sunny demis in 38C (I know, I know... but I did the upside down and backwards test and I'd actually say the band fits, maybe just a touch snug) so this is quite a change.  I did go to a few in person stores to look around and the recommended size looked absolutely massive, but I did not try anything on due to time restraints.  I think the visual difference has to do with shape, so some additional information on my breast shape: 

-Shallow/slight projection

-Wide set

-Short to average root height


I've been searching and searching and there just doesn't seems to be anything that checks all (or even most) of the boxes typically recommended for my stats.

So experts: do you agree with the calculator results? And what bra brands and styles do you recommend trying first? 

Thank you!"

Did my first try on DIY lashes today with a pretty light lash but with band, not the thick one but not invisible, 10 + 12 mm. Did all the steps and were careful not to place the lashes too close to the lash line and curled my lashes. 

But afterwards I felt the same way as with heavy fake lashes, the heavy feeling makes me feel tired and like I see them all the time..

Got so annoyed I removed them but going to give it another go tomorrow! 

So please! Anyone had the same issue? Suggestions?!üôèüèª "

I even spoke to my psychology professor who told me I should have him get help but he wont do counseling or anything other then drink or smoke

I've seen moe. 4 times in the 2000s and phish 4 times in the 90's and I can honestly say Dogs are on par.  I would rather see them than phish if I had to choose.

I've encountered an issue with removing the front plug, and I was curious if anyone else has encountered something similar, particularly with the refurbished ANSgear Victors.

  
The vertical screw on the underside holding the front plug in place absolutely refuses to budge - it almost looks like it's been drilled into the marker. See photo:

I've been given advice on how to control the look and I'd say I'm doing pretty well. I should note that I have never watched a play I wasn't running lights for, and so far I have not looked up much related to lighting outside of the API for our lighting board (Cognito 2)  
I have a very hard time reading long blocks of text, idk if I am dyslexic, (too expensive) so that's why I am asking here instead of looking elsewhere

So I am wanting advice on:  
Lighting balance and coloring (LED's vs gels)  
terminology  
fade times and working alongside music  
lighting bands  
Marking scripts

less important for now but maybe in the future:  
what do I need to know to transition to an ETC board  
any skills that might be more useful in a more professional environment

broader tech:  
dealing with directors' expectations and relevant common practices (I am the head/sole tech for the shows I run, so I'm the one dealing with the directors / stage managers)  
  
Who should I get feedback from? I want my show to look good, but also be safe (one show a stage manager got pissy that I wanted a blueout instead of a pure blackout when 20 kids had to rush off stage)

  
If there is a good resource easily accessible for any of my questions just lmk, I have to leave for a show in a few minutes so I am kinda just spitting out this post while it's still on my mind, I'm probably going to forget I posted this by the time I get back"

As for the albums from the ZP era, these are my favourites, probably because of the quality music they made then, even the live recordings from that period seem extraordinary to me, even if ZP wasnot constant all the time, this is not necessarily a problem considering that most of the things sung by the band at that time were live, in the studio albums from the ZP era we have extraordinary songs that even now make me wonder when i listen to them again, where did that strenght of the music of the 2000s that brought something new?

Two men enter, one man leaves. That was my desire with this game. 1v1 e-sports are dead outside of fightan, and I wanted to make a 1v1 strategy game that looks like Chess, but adds a whole layer of modern strategy game mechanics on top of it.

I thought this game would only have niche appeal, and have been working on this as an on again off again hobby project for over 3 years, but after the 2k upvotes and reddit award I got it was a huge wake up call that I need to do something to get this game made.

This game is still a work in progress, in particular, at the time of this writing, the Evil Black army has been signfificantly reworked and untested, and because of the complexities of being a SSI recipient in the United States, I'm still trying to figure out how this project crowdfunded, get the permission of certain bands to use their music as background music for Youtube videos, as many of their tracks haven't been DMCAed on Youtube for years and years.

I am an elder god of the internet, nearly 40 years old, grew up on Quake and Brood war, and formerly had a widespread reputation on the internet known as the Administrator of Hell, the webmaster of www.oddwebsite.com, which you can find in the wayback machine, if you want to see some legendary shitposting, but I can't reactivate it for four reasons. The entire site was dependent on flash which has been deprecated for security issues as it's too powerful, it would take one DMCA from Nintendo to knock out all their chiptune music and knock half the site out, I can't afford hosting, and I am clueless to how modern HTML works. 

I made a career pivot to becoming a paid moderator for MLG, where they contacted me, and asked me if I was really Zanno, because I didn't act like I did on oddwebsite, and I explained to them professional gaming is one of my passions and I take it very seriously. Then I made the second most popular 1v1 map in Halo 3, Greenhouse, but it was before the era of Twitch streaming and no one ever remembers the second most popular thing, so it has been lost to history. During the Halo 3 era, it was agreed within the community, Octagon was a test of aim, and not much else, while Greenhouse and its sister maps that used the MLG Forge 1v1 ruleset and item layout was a scaled down version of the MLG ruleset and was for serious tryhards.

I encourage you to post anything you want in my sub that follows the rules of my sub, reddit rules, and United States law. While I am new to running a reddit sub, I am not new to running forums, so I am going be a based moderator who will be totally chill unlike other mods who just clamp down on the slightest silly thing or anything tangential to the topic of their sub."

The below outline the chain of events:

I purchased the brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB on the the 06th of January 2025.
The phone was delivered on the 07th of January 2025 to my UK address.
The phone became faulty (stopped reading SIM cards) at around 01:00 (can't confirm the time exactly) on 12th of January 2025, whilst charging overnight at a Premier Inn.
I flew to Australia at 08:30 on January the 12th.
I realised the SIM card was not being read/ the phone was faulty on the 14th of January and contacted Google. I was told by a member of Google that an advanced replacement (new phone) could be provided (after i complained because they were going to send me a refurbished phone to replace my band new phone). 
I was later told by another representative that this is not the case and the only return and refund/ exchange could be done in the UK, not to my address in Australia. 
Apologies, I was probably quite rude on the online chat as i was incredibly frustrated.
On the 18th of January, I reopened another case and received an email, on the 20th of January I requested a full refund for the phone.
My phone was given to a friend, who was travelling back to the UK and they have posted the phone, 1st class signed for, back to the original address i purchased the phone from (my parents address).
I received an email from Google on the 21st of January saying that this has been passed onto the support specialists.
I had not received an email from them by the 24th of January, so I reopened the online chat/ support.
After much waiting, they tried to say that my request was out of the 14 day returns policy to which i had to 'fight' and inform them that my request was on the 20th of January, within the 14 day policy. I had to remind them of the UK law which i checked on the UK gov website. They stated that they needed an additional 24 hours to reply to my email, they could not confirm whether specialist support requires 96 hours to reply an email or that my case had been mis-handled.
I requested to be passed to their complaints department, for which they couldn't and gave me no email/ contact/ way of contacting them.

I have now received an email saying all they can do is offer me a replacement, this is against all consumer law here in the uk ‚ÄòYou must offer a refund to customers if they‚Äôve told you within 14 days of receiving their goods that they want to cancel. They have another 14 days to return the goods once they‚Äôve told you.‚Äô

Please can someone provide advice on what to do?"

Mini Treasure review,dcl,1i9wkax,2025-01-25 15:45:07,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1i9wkax/mini_treasure_review/,chunt42,:SailorMinnie: DISCUSSION,"Rough edges?  Yes, we were on cruise 5.  Loose hinges, sold out of the unique merch for the most part, frequent breaks for the Aquamouse and so on.  I ignored all of this as a negative (but Disney‚Äôs rushing items out the door before they are ready is starting to wear thin).

Was with a mobility impaired adult.  The dead end passageways scattered around the ship combined with the elevator situation was a large hurdle for us.


Pros:  Moana was stunning.  I would not be surprised to find this is a test for an actual Broadway show.  The leads were near perfectly cast.  Three shows for the day they had it and all were packed.  Easily the high point of the trip and well worth skipping an evening meal to experience.

Haunted Parlor:  perfect bullseye for that target.  Well wirth multiple trips to experience it all - and there are a ton of details to notice.

The photo ops in the lobby were largely ‚Äúmagical‚Äù and the tech is getting better all the time.  We thought the photopass, which we bought, was exactly worth the price.


The Ok:  the other shows, the adult area and the variety of (small) lounges.  I‚Äôll put the pools and Aquamouse here as well:  certainly fun, but nothing exceptional.

The bad:

All the food I had was lukewarm.  That includes Palo.  I sent my steak there back to get it heated and it came back warmer, but still not hot.  Same for everything from the restaurants,  food fair and snack bars.  Sigh.

The magic band was not worth it since it was cumbersome to remove to purchase anything.  The card seems easier to use overall.

And the largest deal breaker - which by itself drops this ship to the bottom of the Disney list - was the volume if the audio in Marvel.  We could not hear our server - that is not an exaggeration.  We could barely talk to the person sitting directly beside us.  The inly feedback i gave on the rorm was to lower the volume here by at least half.  This was a fun cruise but i have to use the phrase ‚Äúdespite the Marvel restaurant ‚Äú.

Hope this helps, and if you want more details i will reply once i can get to a proper keyboard.

Fair winds all!"

I feel confused/disappointed with this as this limits our options so my question is whether rings really are that limited to resizing? What do other people do with more intricate wedding rings?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For sale is a Sheaffer vac filler from made in the later 1930's or early to mid 1940's. This particular model was called the Statesman. It somewhat of a pocket pen at 4.9 inches capped, but becomes a rather large pen when posted (it was meant to be be posted). The celluloid color was called Golden Brown.

**Short description:**  
It's a high quality pen made by Sheaffer while they were the #1 US pen brand. Marked B condition because there is a speck of brassing / plating wear to the very bottom of the pen clip. The rest of the clip is cosmetically flawless and so is the rest of the pen. No plating wear to the cap band or 2-tone nib and no scratches anywhere. The celluloid ink window is still the original yellowish white color (most of these have ambered to orange or red due to ink exposure) which suggests this pen wasn't used much if at all. Nib is firm & glassy smooth. The vacuum filling system has been professionally restored by Gerry Berg, the best restorer for Sheaffer vac fillers.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pen History:**  
Sheaffers vac filler line likely needs little introduction. They made out around 1936 and use the same filling mechanism as the well known Pilot Custom 823.

The early Sheaffer vac fillers used carbon steel rods coated with a black substance (I believe celluloid) and a distinct striped celluloid pattern on the blind caps which was different from the barrel. If you're curious and want to see a comparison pic of what the early ones looked like, see [https://imgur.com/a/3vT0pgU](https://imgur.com/a/3vT0pgU). 

Since this pen has the longer blind cap, we can say it was made after 1938, when the switch was made.

This pen is a Statesman model as indicated by the 875 mark on the barrel (the original price of this pen, $8.75. A substantial amount to pay for a pen during that time.) and the lack of a white dot. The lack or a white dot simply meant the pen didn't come with Sheaffers extended warranty / lifetime guarantee which their more expensive pens came with.

It was labeled as a mid-tier vs top-tier pen from Sheaffers lineup at the time but really it was engineered the same way as the more expensive models. The warranty policy was really the only difference. 

The Statesman came in 5 colors. Carmine (Red), Marine Green, Golden Brown, Gray Pearl & plain Black. The striped celluloid colors were only available with a vacuum filling system (nearly identical to the modern Pilot 823). The black version came in a lever filler plus a vacuum fill option.

Sheaffers striped celluloids (which they called Radite) are considered one of the most stable celluloids used in vintage pens. It's very durable and does not decay or discolor. The ribbed grip section is also a very nice touch.

This pen was in production throughout the early to mid 1940's when Sheaffer was the #1 U.S. pen brand in terms of size & gross sales.

They put Parker into the #2 slot (even though Sheaffer pens were more expensive).

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Nib & Writing Experience:**  
These nibs were made to be super smooth & super firm. That is what you're getting here. Glassy smooth, firm Fine nib with no flex. It's a very pleasant nib, perfectly sculpted by Sheaffer and untouched since. The nib is perfect. See the writing sample.

The cap comes off in just 1/2 of a rotation (shows how much thought went into it).

This pen was designed to used posted. It has a very smooth metal sleeve around the bottom portion of the cap which allowed the user to go nuts with posting it without any risk of the cracks developing in the cap. 

**The posted length is 5.5 inches**. Unposted it is 4.25 inches. The capped length is 4.9 inches. There are side comparisons in the photo gallery. 

The silver portion of the nib is platinum (or was it palladium?) plated. Sheaffer had a marketing campaign where they suggested the plating helped the ink flow but this is likely just a gimmick.

The ink capacity on these is quite huge for a small pen as the whole barrel is the ink reservoir. I think it's something like 1.5 or 2ml.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Filling System & Restoration:**  
This pen uses a vacuum filling system nearly identical to the Pilot 823. The only difference if you don't need to unscrew the blind cap when you want ink to flow continuously. The pen has a semi-transparent barrel which serves as an ink window.

The pen uses no sac. To fill it you just unscrew the end, extend the rod, dip the nib in ink and press the rod down once and screw the end back in. Same exact method as filling the Pilot 823.

I had the filling system professionally restored by Gerry Berg who is well known in vintage circles as the #1 best restorer for Sheaffer vac fillers. Sheaffer vac fillers are his specialty and he has a unique method of restoring these that gets you a near 100% barrel fill on 1 stroke. Where as other restorers consider anything above 50% to be great. This pen was restored in December of 2024 and only tested with water since then.

The restoration should be good for several decades at least.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Condition:**  
\[B\] There's a little bit of brassing / plating loss on the very bottom of the clip as you can see in the photos. No other flaws to point out. The Sheaffer imprint on the barrel is crisp. The gold filled trim on the cap band and is flawless and free of any wear. I examined the pen from top to bottle and couldn't locate a single scratch.

The semi-transparent barrel is unstained as you can see in the photos. Many of these have ambrered to dark red from exposure to red / purple inks. This is just a quirk of transparent celluloid. If you want to play it safe in inks, stick with black, blue and green inks from Sheaffer, Parker, Diamine, Pelikan, J Herbin, and Waterman. It will probably be fine if you use some other brands like Robert Oster. Shimmer or sheening inks are a bad idea. Ideally no Japanese inks either due to their pH often not being great for celluloid. If you don't care about staining the ink window feel free to use red / orange / purple inks too. Staining doesn't make the celluloid fragile or anything. 

Priced very reasonably at $155 even though you get the original box + matching mechanical pencil. The pencil comes with lead and more is easy to obtain if you decide you want it. The lead moves up and down when you twist the top half of the pen.

53 and newly diagnosed with FSHD1,MuscularDystrophy,1i9wcdk,2025-01-25 15:35:16,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuscularDystrophy/comments/1i9wcdk/53_and_newly_diagnosed_with_fshd1/,Elegant_Ride_9888,selfq,"I'm 53 years old and just I received my diagnosis 2 days ago. This began about 2 years ago with a slight dent in my chest that continued to spread. Nobody believed me when I told them something was going on with my chest. MRI'S, Nerve impulse tests, etc... all looked good. Eventually I caused enough stink at my physicians office and had them send me to a muscular disease clinic. I also noticed my thigh muscles aren't what they used to be. Im 53 and have lead a sedentary lifestyle for a long time now so Im not thinking I should have rock solid thighs. My muscle neuro guy told me that my body is strong, arms , legs, feet, hands, etc.. still good control and strenght.

So here I am today trying to make sense of what is happening to me. Im reading some scary stuff about ending up in a wheel chair and losing control of my arms. I'm hoping someone with a similar story to mine can shed some light on this.

How do I exercise, resistance bands, free weights, calisthenics, cardio? Do i need 2 grams or protein per KG of body weight? Is creatine good to supplement with along with a good whey protein?

How do I keep the muscle I have left from dieing, or at least slowing it down a bit?

Thanks for reading my post

I finally found a setting that makes it go away , change the Apple TV video setting from 4k HDR to 4k SDR, see comparison photos 

So now my question, what am I giving up by viewing SDR vs HDR cause so far it seems like HDR is doing more harm than good lol

We were both on the shift and the cashier needed verification for the card and HE did it, mind you I was there too. So after that, (on the cameras, we didn't see this) the lady asked for balloons (but wasn't really getting them) for the sole purpose to distracted him so he'd leave his register unattended. While she pointed and he looked away, she typed on the screen $500 in cash for the gift card HERSELF. While she did that a lady next to her watched her do it DID NOT say anything, the lady closed the drawer, walked up to the cashier and snatched the visa card out his hand and left.
Now to the present, they tried to fired the cashier, but the other manager took the blame so he wouldn't, but now he's suspended because he verified it and now dollar tree is looking for a fall guy here because this white lady robbed us.
Now here's where I need some information, is it required for a manager to stand at the register while a gift card is being purchased? That's the whole argument, that HE DIDNT STAY THERE. We usually don't have to.. is there a way to save this dude?"
