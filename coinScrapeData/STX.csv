Why I'm Bullish on Stacks,stacks,1i99tyk,2025-01-24 18:56:22,22,0.97,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stacks/comments/1i99tyk/why_im_bullish_on_stacks/,youngianmichael,STX Price Discussion,"Essentially we are getting close to the lows on STX/BTC on many different indicators -

1. \- Price Action
2. \- RSI
3. \- Stochastics
4. \- The Jewel Lite
5. \- VRVP

We could grind out in the 1.20 area for awhile tbh but this would be fine as most are staking for yield with their stacks anyway. The charts are showing that this is a good time to swap from BTC to STX. We are very likely at least due for a bounce at some point so essentially if you are bullish on BTC than it makes sense to be bullish on STX as STX will likely rise more than BTC based on this chart. Obviously this is assuming we see a bounce in the STX/BTC pairing. STX/USD is also coming to a point where it could double bottom assuming the 1.20 price holds as a new local low. Time will tell, but as the saying goes, "" A rising tide floats all boats"" , if BTC goes up its likely everything else goes up and STX will have a stong bull-case if momentum shifts to its side. My only caveat is that if we lose the 1.20 low we likely head down to around the 70-90 cents area which would prob mean bitcoin is still going through sideways price action.

Payout options for Xverse STX stacking pool,stacks,1i77tue,2025-01-22 05:03:30,13,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stacks/comments/1i77tue/payout_options_for_xverse_stx_stacking_pool/,mc_mendez,Stacking,"I am currently participating in STX stacking via the Xverse Pool and have noticed that Bitcoin transaction fees significantly reduce the net rewards received. I wanted to inquire whether there are any plans in development to introduce features that allow stackers to:
	1.	Batch payouts—so multiple rewards can be sent together to optimise transaction costs.
	2.	Customise payout schedules—allowing users to choose less frequent BTC distributions to save on fees.

Implementing such options could enhance the stacking experience by reducing costs and increasing efficiency for participants. I’d appreciate any insights on whether this is being considered or if alternative solutions are available."

The dock is connected to an M1 Mac mini running the latest version of macOS (15.2). 

Recently, I have been finding that this dock and corresponding drives are mysteriously disconnecting from the Mac mini - sometimes several times a day! I think this is a power issue because when this happens I notice the light on the miniStack STX is off and the light on the power supply is also off. After plugging the dock's power supply into an [Eve Energy (smart plug)](https://a.co/d/8qoQLY3) and monitoring energy consumption I am seeing that when drives unexpectedly disconnect, the outlet is no longer drawing any power.

I am unable to reconnect the drives by unseating and reseating the thunderbolt cable on my Mac mini. It is only after I unplug the power supply and plug it back in that the drives will mount again. I'm not sure why this would be happening. Has anyone else experienced this before? Are there additional diagnostics I can do to narrow down the source of the problem?"

But this is not a straight path without obstacles. I’ve been part of the Stacks community since 2019, when I received an airdrop from Blockchain.info. From that moment, I started researching and trusting the project. I went on to accumulate over 15,000 STX for stacking in Xverse, earned satoshis, reinvested in memecoins like Welsh and NOT, participated in DeFi through AlexLab and Arkadiko, and faced losses when AlexLab’s liquidity pools got wrecked. I also suffered a loss when my Arkadiko vault was liquidated for 5,000 STX, even though it was ""safe"" above the liquidation price.

Then, personal challenges hit. I had to sell STX to get through tough times. Nicolás Maduro rigged Venezuela’s elections, and I haven’t seen my family since I left my country. Mentally, I wasn’t in a good place last year or this one. There were moments when it felt like everything was falling apart.

But you know what? Despite everything, I’m grateful for all of it. These experiences have shaped my character and my perspective on the crypto world. They’ve been invaluable lessons in detachment and in managing both my finances and my emotions. I even appreciate having lost half of my holdings because now I know: I’m truly prepared for what’s ahead.

I’m no longer motivated by money; I’m motivated by freedom. And while Bitcoin and Stacks don’t provide complete freedom—because this world is increasingly built to control us—I believe they offer a path to a bit more freedom than the average system allows. And that’s enough for me to keep going 👊

I've also seen a lot of discussion comparing stx to uniswaps market cap (Uniswap being L2 of ethereum). However IMO this is not correct. In 15 years, if bitcoin is the defacto store of value, then its L2 will superceed an independent network like ethereum. Hence the real market cap potential of a proper bitcoin L2 should be on par with current leading L1s like ethereum or Sol.

As a web3 developer, I know how these systems work, and I’m confident this wasn’t my error but a flaw in their interface at the time.

Now, I’m out 100 STX, and [Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com) has shown no willingness to help or investigate properly. This experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I feel like they are neglecting their responsibility to users.

I am from a Ter-2/3 college CSE(KJ Somaiya(autonomous) , have non-pressurizing parents and expectedly less need of my earning(though my father's in a top Govt. organization) .I had a CGPA of 8.2 in my FY but fucked up SY due to not being able to manage skills and studies, and it's currently at 7.51(averaging all, dunno if higher SGPA's are given more weightage or not), though %age is 65🤡.I got 90% in 10th and 78% in 12th.

My tech skills are decent, though, as you all can see on my resume . I am full-stack wrt Dev(beginner in Firebase , built a MERN project), went to 2 hackathons(lost), am 3 Star on CodeChef , got a paid and a Govt. internship to show for(upcoming at a SDE one as well). Also, recently built a LaTeX cheatsheet as well wrt actual open-source : [LaTeX Cheatsheet Link](https://latex-cheatsheet.vercel.app/).

Please give me some tips, would building a startup be a good idea, or go for job?

P.S. : Didn't put HTML, CSS on resume ,despite being proficient in them , as they are design tools, on the suggestion of a senior.."

Specialties and have different strategies! Do what works! Stack greens! I am not doubting or comparing myself with anyone! Do you!,UltimateTraders,1hfju82,2024-12-16 09:06:32,6,1.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/1hfju82/12162024_daily_plays_sold_mu_10175_traded_inod/,UltimateTraders,Daily Plays,"Good morning everyone. I hope my briefings/writings do not offend anyone. I use my years of experience and my thesis/ideas in order to arm people to stack greens! There are many ways to make money. Many! I don’t say my way is the best way, or only way. I am sure there are plenty of traders that can make more, quicker as well. I merely trade the way I feel comfortable. So should you! If your strategy works, keep doing it! Use these as added ideas to add to your repertoire. If you have a strategy and idea you want to share, you can definitely add it here, or even do a post sharing ideas. #discussion These daily plays average 3-5,000 reads. I am not trying to do click bait but when I write about GME AMC PLTR TSLA these can go to 8,000-9,000! That is a lot considering this forum only has 9,600 users. That means it is likely being shared. I am banned all over Reddit. I am followed by 1,600 on X/Twitter. I am thinking of writing DD on Seekingalpha. I never have but have been using it 10+ years. I merely want the stocks I cover to go up! If I am short for those, to go down…. I follow 300 tickers daily. This is because the max tickers allowed on a watchlist is 300. I have almost 30 watch lists, but only watch 300 on a daily basis. I say that because there is no way for me to follow every company. So, of course I am going to miss a lot of stocks, I will miss tons of hot stocks, memes, grenades… Tons! I know this! I am also not competing with anyone. I am doing what works for me…

I aim to make 300-600 per trade… Lately I will take 200! If I can do 3-5 of these a day, amazing!

I am happy to do just 2 of these a day, 10 of these a week.

10 x 200 = 2,000

52 x 2,000 = 104,000

I am ok! It is not my goal, I would like to make 20% a year, but the past few years since 2021, I have backed off trading.

In the year 2022, I hardy traded any shares! In 2023, when the market made 0 sense to me…

I didn’t trade anything! I was up like 3% last year!

I am up near 12% this year.. Keep in mind, I am trading with probably less than 10% of capital to do this…

I just see the risk as way too high to trade with more. I try and tell my guys, or anyone that asks.

The end of 2021, saw a sharp decline in the growth of sales and earnings.

1^(st) and 2^(nd) quarter of 2021, we were seeing 20/20 \[20% sales growth and 20% earnings growth on most SPY VOO SP500 companies\] by the 3^(rd) quarter it dropped to 10/10 and by the 4^(th) quarter of 2021, reported early 2022 we were seeing 5/5….In fact by the end of 2022 we were seeing a decline in sales and earnings! This was the same story for 1^(st) and 2^(nd) quarter 2023.

This is why I said we should have stayed at 3,500 until summer of 2023.

I wanted to go in deep and jump in as the numbers started to get better…But by summer 2023, when we should have been around 3,500, we were at 4,600-4,800… We just rallied way too fast, way to soon… Over a year later, we have grown into a valuation of near 4,900.

This is 242 SPY VOO SP500 expected earnings… 20x these earnings.. Companies have steadily grown there sales and earnings..

Problem? We are at 6,100! So, you do you! Keep making that money and ignore the noise!

So that is why I am taking bunt singles, and ill take 200 bucks!

To me, in order to be worth 6,100… I want to see SP500 earnings at 300!

Analysts have next years earnings at 272.

So, even if they are accurate… which I feel that is way too high! That would mean we should be near 5,500 by the end of next year!!! END!

As I said Friday.. This is not Nathan saying that we are headed to 5,500.

This is Nathan saying anything above that is playing with fire!

I 100% believe that eventually we will make 300 per share.. 100% for sure! But is that 2026? 2027? And I am perfectly fine if I miss out…

I am not ready to pay 23-25x for earnings…

I currently am 6-7x on my investment properties…

Meaning, if I put 100K into a property, I expect to make back the 100K within 7 years! So why should I buy TSLA for 150x, PLTR for 200x come on man!

This is like a game of hot potato… You make money, unloading your shares on someone else who thinks it is going higher.. There is no substance here…

If I am putting 100K in a property, I am expecting to make 15K a year in cash flows, returning my 100K in 7 years!!

TSLA PLTR ? Come on man!

A 1.4 trillion dollar car company that cant even make 10 billion!!! 150x earnings.. Come on man!

I am not saying it is going down, a stock price is based on daily sentiment… I am writing/telling the reader, do I buy more property or roll the dice on speculation?!?

 

Once again, you do you! Ignore the noise if you are making a killing on these. Stack those greens, amazing! But not me! You don’t need to try and convince me, or tell me I missed this, or that you are better than me…. I crossed a million in 2006…I paid off my moms house about 25! I am good! Your goals are different than mines! Make that money!

 

I had MU from 99.40 and sold 101.75. Earnings coming Wednesday. I am also in 100 shares at 120 that I got stuck in months ago. I may actually buy calls, small bet. Maybe! I had INOD 200 shares at 35, I sold 36.40, I got back in late Friday 34.25. I tried to sell EVER 18.50, in 250 at 17.80, high was 18.29… I am back in DNUT 9.90. I tried to bid on ZIM CLSK and ACMR , I was watching PRAA . I got in STX 95.95. Many ideas, but I am going in as safe as possible.

 

5 Trade Ideas:

INOD – I started trading this AI data interpreter around 35. The growth is there, it did have a short report, so I am only buying 1 block. The valuation is high, but growth! I am back in 34.25 and hope for 36?

 

STX – In 100 at 95.95, they do memory/hard drives for computers/servers, earnings was very good, I have been trading this a lot! 98+ ?

 

EVER DNUT – I am in 250 EVER at 17.80, maybe 19? If I must ill take the 18.50. I would like to make 25 cents on DNUT, 1,000 at 9.90. \[I also have 1,000 at 13.55\]

 

ZIM ACMR – These are more safe at these levels, shipping rates may come down January, but right now near 3,500 a container. 18s-19s ok for ZIM … ACMR is worth 30!

 

CLSK TMDX – These are dice rolls, valuation! CLSK bitcoin bet!

I need two external drives for video editing, and they will not be RAID.

OWC miniStack STX- can those two drives share a single Thunderbolt connection to the Mac Studio? Is that generally the case with dual-ssd enclosures, that they can share a single connection and not be RAIDed? In the case of the MiniStack, I'm okay with one of those drives being an SATA rather than both being NVME. But I've read that speeds on the miniStack are slow?

Otherwise I can just buy two single enclosures, but that will take up half of my TB plugs. Not ideal. 

Any input or ideas would be much appreciated.

Consistent Turn 3-4 Kill: Updated Temur Neoform (now with Pioneer Masters!) 90% WR to Top 250 Mythic,MtGHistoric,1hc1nb5,2024-12-11 14:24:35,36,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtGHistoric/comments/1hc1nb5/consistent_turn_34_kill_updated_temur_neoform_now/,empathyforinsects,,"[Updated Temur Neoform](https://preview.redd.it/kjajnzzv686e1.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5c48bc1eeb6b70661306faeb4c0e61c05626e3)

I present to you an update on a Historic classic Archetype with \[\[Neoform\]\] combo. Full Disclosure: this is one of my favorite archetypes of all time in Historic and I used to run it in Bo1 for years to rank into Mythic. The deck fell out of favor due to power creep through the years, but I've noticed this year that slowly and slowly they were printing cards that could fit really decent into the Neoform combo shell. In particular this year the deck gained: Sylvan Tutor, Thundertrap Trainer, and now with the addition of Pioneer masters we have Sylvan Caryatid, which is probably the most crucial addition.

For those unfamiliar with the Neoform Combo, you basically play Neoform sacrificing a two-drop creature but with a copy the next instant or sorcery on the stack and search out \[\[Dualcaster Mage\]\] which copies one of the Neoforms on the stack, enabling you to draw out the rest of your Dualcaster Mage (Glasspool Mimic counting as copies 5-8) and then finally searching \[\[Tuktuk Rubblefort\]\] and \[\[Combat Celebrant\]\] for haste and exert to OTK your opponent.

There are a couple of ways to copy Neoforms effect but the most common is casting \[\[Sea Gate Stormcaller\]\] before casting Neoform and then sacrificing either the Stormcaller or another two drop on board. With the addition of \[\[Sylvan Caryatid\]\] from Pioneer Masters we now have 8 two-drops that not only work as mana acceleration for our combo (you need 4 mana to combo) but also work as a guaranteed sacrifice considering they have Hexproof (\[\[Paradise Druid\]\] is the other hexproof two-drop). Other ways to copy Neoform also include \[\[Galvanic Iteration\]\] and Expansion/Explosion and that works on any two-drop. You can also just use Dualcaster Mage itself, but that requires 5 mana (not so much intensive anymore with the 4 extra copies of Hexproof mana dork).

Bloomburrow also made this archetype a lot more consistent with the addition of \[\[Thundertrap Trainer\]\] a card that not only can be used to sacrifice to Neoform, but also find you the Neoform itself (or a Solve the Equation, so you can set up for a turn 4). \[\[Into the Flood Maw\]\] is a nice post-board interactive spell to help us bounce pesky permanents such as \[\[Hushbringer\]\] and \[\[High Noon\]\]. \[\[Sylvan Tutor\]\] works as a way to grab any of our two-drops in a pinch. A common play is to grab Stormcaller of the tutor, but sometimes I grab a hexproof creature to play around removal, or even an Otter to help find the Neoform.

\[\[Pyroclasm\]\] has done an excellent job in the board as a counter to aggro or low curve decks. I managed to win some post-board games against auras due to this sweeper. I decided to also run \[\[Spell Pierce\]\] as my counterspell of choice to battle some of the other unfair decks (I'm looking at you Sorin/Elanda) and one copy of Pact of Negation as a way to force turn 3 against decks playing mostly counter magic interaction.

Lastly, to round out the sideboard is good ole \[\[Leyline of Sanctity\]\] to protect your combo from discard.

The list has some flex spots, and I don't think this is the most optimal build, but I threw it together with the release of Pioneer Masters and ran a gauntlet of 10 matches. The result: 9-1 with a 90% Win rate, only losing to a Thoughtseize/Inquisition deck (and that game came down to a very decisive game 3, but overall, I don't think we are favored against heavy discard decks). I was able to climb from 97% Mythic to top 250 within that match span. I'll jam more games with this list and try to optimize here and there to see what the limits are. I haven't updated the manabase in a while, so maybe that could use an update (or maybe sideboard can be a bit cleaner). Either way this deck will not disappoint, and I think it is a sleeper deck in the current meta.

For those wanting to see how the deck plays out (as well as additional commentary), you can watch the full 10-match run here: [https://youtu.be/PLMtmCxfgyU](https://youtu.be/PLMtmCxfgyU)

2024 Mac mini keeps restarting from sleep/startup/logging in,mac,1h7onlh,2024-12-05 19:38:51,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1h7onlh/2024_mac_mini_keeps_restarting_from/,megamanx858x,My Mac,"Hi there guys, I could use some advice to see where I can go about fixing this. So long story short I contacted apple support when I first got the Mac and about two weeks ago cause the problem continues. I get the restart error due to a problem occurring, and the latest senior tech support told me this most likely happened because I used migration to transfer my files and software from my 2010 iMac. Pretty much telling me that over 14 years of OS updates and files that something didn't transfer correctly and is throwing off the new Mac mini. 

  
They told me completely reinstall the latest Mac OS on the hard drive and do not use migration, only to transfer my files to the computer and whatever newer software I want just to download it. My extra storage setup is a OWC mini stack STX. One SSD is for Time Machine backups and the other is just a storage in which I moved my photo library, comic book collection. My iTunes library is on the Time Machine backup.

  
So I did what was asked, I don't even have my bootleg versions of Microsoft office installed. I connected my photo library to the external, and I transfer my iTunes library back, and some programs that were intel but rosetta can run them.

  
Sure enough the problem happened again. So I deleted all my music off Apple Music, and deleted any older intel based apps (I hardly have any that work on Mac silicon now) just to be safe and the restarting keeps happening.

  
I really don't want to try and reinstall the operating system again and cherry pick files but I want to know if maybe my older music files, photo library or even the external mini STX might be the culprit. I want to take it to an Apple Store since its under warranty and maybe they can give me a new one but I am trying everyone else before that.

  
I am using Clean My Mac to search and delete any older applications that might be lingering and preferences I don't need but since I only dragged and dropped selective files this time around its super limited what else it can be. This thing restarts while do the error restart while sleeping, waking up to log in, or even when turning on from shut down.

  
Any advice be appreciate, thanks."

While Stacks may seem like it’s lagging behind at the moment, don’t be fooled. **This is not the end of the BTC ecosystem rally—it’s just the beginning.**

# Why Stacks Is a Game-Changer

Stacks isn’t just another BTC ecosystem token. It’s leading the charge with real, tangible upgrades that are set to redefine how Bitcoin interacts with the broader blockchain space:

* **Nakamoto Upgrade:** This upgrade has transformed the Stacks ecosystem, delivering faster transactions and significantly reduced fees. No other BTC ecosystem project has accomplished this level of technical advancement. Stacks is blazing the trail in both technology and marketing.
* **sBTC Upgrade:** This upcoming development is monumental. It allows **BTC to flow seamlessly into the Stacks ecosystem**, unlocking massive potential for DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. This isn’t just an upgrade; it’s the bridge that could bring **Bitcoin into the next era of usability**.

# The Bigger Picture

Bitcoin is the undisputed king of crypto. It’s the symbol of decentralization, and the entire market revolves around its movements. But here’s the revolutionary idea: **what happens when BTC becomes more than just a store of value?**

Imagine using Bitcoin for **DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other applications**. Stacks is the key to unlocking this future. And with TVL likely to skyrocket post-sBTC, **Stacks will become the foundation for Bitcoin’s evolution into a multi-use asset.**

# My Take

The signs are clear. $STX is starting to move, and I have no doubt it’s heading toward **new all-time highs**. This is a moment to act, not to hesitate. Stacks isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s wave—it’s building the infrastructure that will propel Bitcoin into the next stage of its dominance.

Mark my words: **$STX is massively undervalued, and the market is about to catch on.**

* **sBTC Upgrade:** This upcoming development is monumental. It allows **BTC to flow seamlessly into the Stacks ecosystem**, unlocking massive potential for DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. This isn’t just an upgrade; it’s the bridge that could bring **Bitcoin into the next era of usability**.

# The Bigger Picture

Bitcoin is the undisputed king of crypto. It’s the symbol of decentralization, and the entire market revolves around its movements. But here’s the revolutionary idea: **what happens when BTC becomes more than just a store of value?**

Imagine using Bitcoin for **DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other applications**. Stacks is the key to unlocking this future. And with TVL likely to skyrocket post-sBTC, **Stacks will become the foundation for Bitcoin’s evolution into a multi-use asset.**

# My Take

The signs are clear. $STX is starting to move, and I have no doubt it’s heading toward **new all-time highs**. This is a moment to act, not to hesitate. Stacks isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s wave—it’s building the infrastructure that will propel Bitcoin into the next stage of its dominance.

Mark my words: **$STX is massively undervalued, and the market is about to catch on.**

Yesterday would have been Epic!?,UltimateTraders,1gx8q0s,2024-11-22 09:12:09,3,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/1gx8q0s/11222024_daily_plays_is_andrew_left_a_member_of/,UltimateTraders,Daily Plays,"Good morning everyone. Sadly, I spent the entire day away from my computer/even cell phone. As crazy as it sounds I prefer to do all my DD on my desktop. I prefer to check charts, read filings and news here. I write my posts and even tweet from here! Most of my tweets are from my phone, but I do write some tweets on my pc! I just feel like if I make trades solely on my phone I am naked! On October 30^(th), a day before Halloween. Someone tried for the 3^(rd) time in just 9 months to steal my 2022 Acura MDX Advanced Type S with 8k miles. I bought the car a little over 2 years ago. Nothing happened to the car until February 2024. After the first time when they actually made off with the car for about 7 days, I started using The Club and Brake Lock. I assumed being in a nice area and around lights and camera no one would try. 2 times after it has! October 17^(th) was the 2^(nd) time and 30^(th) was the 3^(rd). I decided this time when I get the car back that I would get rid of it. They stole my wheels, broke my windshield, damaged the doors, the leather seats, ripped some parts apart to try and steal the car… it has been a nightmare. I live in a very good area in Queens, NYC. However, we are close to trains/buses and people have accessibility to me.. This is why I do not want to buy an amazing dream car until I get a place more secluded and private. At my mom’s house, there are 2 parking spots in the driveway. I bought a new BMW 750 that takes 1 space and my brother uses the other….. I was telling my mom that I would park my Acura by my apartment and she was worried and displeased… It doesn’t make sense to use a parking lot, because there are no parking lots close to me… So I am not going to walk to a parking lot 1 mile away to drive my car… or drive my BMW to drive my Acura.. so just to put my mom at ease I told her I would get rid of the bad luck car immediately…..

The car was ready about a week ago, but I have been to busy to get it, I decided yesterday right at the open to head out… First to pick up my Acura from the body shop and then go from the body shop to a place in Long Island to get a used car, less attractive, plain etc… So I unfortunately, didn’t leave the dealership until about 7? I got there about 11:30? It took a while to appraise my Acura, pick out what #regular car I would buy and time to make the deal. It takes time to make a deal because dealers often advertise misleading ads in order to get customers in the shop.. which I understand. \[I actually sold cars for 2 years, 2012 and 2013\]. I had wanted to buy a small used car dealership… but it took me just those 2 years to learn the ins and outs, the scams, the fraud that needs to be done, if you want to make a lot of money.

FRAUD AND SCAMS! I am not about that so I decided to step away from cars in 2014. I started working in 2012, because I was targeted in 2011 and went thru a tragic experience… taking on a normal life, everyday work… in case I was watched, followed, was the best thing for me to do. \[More reason why I wanted to make sure when I was ready/able to 1 day, to get a very private place in long island\] I have always loved cars, cars was the reason I got into stocks at 14! I am sure I could have made tons on Cars, but I would have had to participate in lies, fraud, scams….

Many people think I am money hungry, heartless, stone cold.. until you really know me…

That is so far from the truth. When I say I want to make money in stocks, I want stocks to go up, and I care about the money made, in stocks… That is true! I can buy almost anything material and have tons of jewelry I do not even wear….

The money for me is different. It gives me freedom, peace and will allow me to be in a position where myself and everyone I care for, care about does not have to worry again…

Also, I truly believe I am more talented if not just as talented as the top guys at Wall street and should be paid as such, or at least get some type of compensation….

So you know, the houses I am looking at are about 5 million dollars. These houses even with 1 million down will have a mortgage payment of 30-40,000 for 30 years! So, it isn’t about the money, but for what I want in life, it takes a lot of money to get there!

 

So, is Andrew Left of Citron a member here? I have tweeted him directly and tagged him often. He is a known short activist. I was busy of course yesterday. I entered an order for SMST 3.50 about 9:35AM… SMST is the bear MSTR ETF, with 2x leverage. It did hit 3.47.. but I was away and taking care of my Acura so I could not follow it closely. Of course Andrew didn’t send me the MEMO that he was going to tweet he was short MSTR … he is known, so that would have been nice! \[I do hope 1 day that my tweets and DD will have this effect long and short… why? I deserve it! Have you followed my DD almost daily since 2021!!!! DAILY!\] My stuff has a thesis and catalyst, this is a pump and dump fest based on brainwashing and hope… man, I wish I got in!

 

For me, I try and make 300-600 normally per trade. The way things are going this year 2-3 rounds in a day is not likely for me. \[Round is Buy/Sell closed trade same day\] I consider 1,000+ a great day…… 2,000+ Amazing….. 3,000+ EPIC!! Look everyone is different, and has different goals… I try and do base hits safely.. No FOMO here. This is my money and my money is important to me… if I was managing others money, or a hedge fund, who must invest.. I would probably be selling tons of cash secured puts on quality companies, and trading the shares!

Yesterday, definitely would have been epic.. The volatility in SMST … I am sure I would have done 2-3 rounds at 200-300 each.. That is 1,000! PRCH hit 4.20!!! I had 1,000 shares since April at 3.75! I sold and made 150, but I am sure had I sat in front of my computer I would have made 2-3x rounds on PRCH!!! I am back in at 3.45… ZIM went wild… I am sure I would have traded it a ton! Instead I am back in 24.10…… I sold MU 100 shares from 100.55 to 102.60…. I sold STX 100 shares from 97.25 to 99…. I sold 250 VITL from 30.35 to 30.75, but this trade Id have changed the order and been trading! Instead I was giving my mom peace! SYM hit 34 and PRAA hit 20! I didn’t see it or have orders… Id have played ZIM calls… I did bid 25 cents for 12/27 calls with 27 strike. The low was 32 cents… But I put in that bid before 10 am? Id have changed it if I followed it…. Watch it go to 55 cents today! I always say we cant be a hindsight trader but this sucks! I did make trades and sells, I did stack greens! SMST doubled! Low 3.47 high of 7! Yesterday, I would have made at least 3,000! Man!

 

I hope to do great trades today! I do have to run some errands and take care of stuff for CT. So let us see!

Some earnings:

DXLG 55    BKE 60    STG 60    GAP 70    CPRT 70    NGVC 70    ESTC 80    LGTY 60

ROST 60    INTU 75    NTAP 70   

 

5 Trade Ideas:

ZIM – I am in 250 shares at 24.10 and hope to sell near 25? I would buy more blocks as well, just until about 12/9

 

STX MU – These should rally off NVDA earnings because they help supply these super computers

PRCH – This is speculative tech online company that helps home buyers with inspection/insurance/mortgage, they are just starting to make money, I have 1,000 at 3.45 hope for 3.75+

 

VITL – This organic farmer had a slight miss, it crashed from 36 to 27, and within 2 weeks. Earnings weren’t great but they were good, valuation is awesome for what you get, I have been trading this dip!

 

PRAA SYM – Both companies I am watching who dipped after great earnings, VITL earnings good, not great

How AIBTC and Bitcoin Faces Launched the Biggest Airdrop in Stacks History,DuaCrypto,1gw24xq,2024-11-20 18:48:35,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuaCrypto/comments/1gw24xq/how_aibtc_and_bitcoin_faces_launched_the_biggest/,duacrypto,MARKETS,"

Hi, I’m **whoabuddy**, leading the efforts at [**aibtc.dev**](http://aibtc.dev), where we’re merging the power of Bitcoin layers with AI to create tools that expand the capabilities of AI agents. Today, I’ll share how we orchestrated **the largest airdrop in Stacks history**, pushing boundaries in blockchain technology.

# The Big Drop

On **October 7th**, we made history at [**aibtc.dev**](http://aibtc.dev) by delivering nearly **800,000 NFTs** in a single airdrop with just **100 STX** in transaction fees (excluding one large mint).

Our aim? To build an ad network using NFTs—functioning as **dynamic billboards** that appear in wallets and can update with new announcements.

Then came **Bitcoin Faces**, with their own massive airdrop:

* They sent **800,000 custom NFTs**, giving each Stacks wallet a unique PFP generated from its address.

Finally, we executed an additional **136,000 NFT drop** to contract deployers and active contracts.  
In just a few days:

* **1.7 million NFTs minted**
* **Total cost: 250 STX**

# The Technical Challenge

We started with a critical question:  
**How many NFTs can we mint in one transaction?**

Before this, most airdrops managed only 500-1,000 NFTs per transaction—often clogging the network. By optimizing the **Clarity** smart contract and leveraging Stacks 2.1 improvements, we discovered a groundbreaking number:  
**14,995 NFTs in a single transaction.**

Our solution included:

* Keeping airdrop lists **separate from the contract** to avoid bloat.
* Using **fold** and **is-err** for efficient minting.

Here’s a breakdown of how the **airdrop contract works**:

1. **Airdrop Function**: Accepts lists of addresses in batches (5k, 5k, 4,995) and iterates over them.
2. **Mint Function**: Executes the mint for each address.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Maximized read counts while leaving room for other transactions in each block.

By adjusting batch sizes from **14,995** to **12,000** and later **6,000**, we minimized fees and reduced network congestion.

# Behind the Numbers

* **Source of Addresses**:
   * Active addresses: Courtesy of **Signal21**, listing 792,096 entries as of October 4, 2024.
   * Contracts and deployers: Data sourced from the **clarity-deployed-contracts GitHub** by Boom.
* **Impact**:
   * Our NFTs now top the leaderboard for **collections by holder count.**
   * Costs per transaction dropped significantly as batch sizes decreased.

# NFT Metadata

For metadata, we opted for a **hosted solution**, allowing dynamic updates to images:

* [**aibtc.dev**](http://aibtc.dev) **NFTs** serve as billboards, updateable with new announcements.
* **Bitcoin Faces NFTs** generate unique PFPs based on wallet addresses.

During the airdrop, we handled **6M image requests** (\~12GB) across wallets and marketplaces.

# What’s Next?

We’re building tools to unite **AI and Bitcoin**.

Join us for the **aibtc Champions Sprint** on **October 28th**, a 5-day trading competition where participants will use our AI platform to generate the best returns.

Our working group meets weekly on Thursdays, and we’re always open to collaborators.

There is no other asset that is yielding native BTC with little to no effort like STX.  Tell people to Buy STX, Transfer to Leather/Xverse, Stack it, and forget it until the yield is too good to ignore.  Show them examples.

I'm currently earning $650-700/month (in BTC) on 40k stacked with Xverse.  It took about 5 button presses to make this happen.  No other financial instrument is this simple except for arguably a basic savings account.   If this ever comes up in my normal everyday discussions - I just pull up Xverse and show people how it works.  75% of the time the person I show will go buy some STX and set up Xverse themselves.  Every little bit counts.  Keep it simple, they will come."

Is there any website or API to see current gas prices?,stacks,1gqur1o,2024-11-13 21:38:30,6,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stacks/comments/1gqur1o/is_there_any_website_or_api_to_see_current_gas/,hacktek,General Discussion,"I just started experimenting with stacks and to be honest, I'm not having a good experience. I stacked on StackingDao pre-nakamoto and found it incredibly slow that I had to wait 30+ minutes for the tx to include, but whatever, the upgrade should make things better, right? Well, I sent a tx last night to open an Arkadiko vault with the gas that leather recommended and it never got included / never progressed past ""in mempool"". It's been over 24 hours since. So I decided to cancel it and doubled the gas to 1 STX and...it's still ""in mempool"" after an hour.

I'm used to alt L1 EVMs (i.e. Avalanche), ETH L2s (i.e. Arbitrum, Polygon) and Solana where things are just fast and cheap. Even if $2 in STX is 'cheap', it's still significantly more expensive that the previously mentioned chains by many multiples (especially for a self-transfer to cancel).

Do I need to increase the gas? Is this expected to be this slow even post nakamoto? Is there at least some website where I can see what the current gas is so that I can better plan my transactions ahead of time?

BTW I checked the block explorer and see transactions being included with lower gas than mine, which makes me wonder if something else might be going on.

EDIT: just found this data here [https://explorer.hiro.so/transactions?chain=mainnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/transactions?chain=mainnet)

Considering so many institutions and companies are investing into BTC, im confused to why many haven’t invested in STX to earn a relatively good bitcoin yield of 9% through staking? Wouldn’t this be a profitable method considering the amount of capital they’re able to invest a 9% yield would be huge to them?

Thanks in advance! "

Best perform Crypto Sectors last week.,CryptoMars,1g8qfx2,2024-10-21 10:02:52,19,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1g8qfx2/best_perform_crypto_sectors_last_week/,tsurutatdk,DISCUSSION,"Last week, the crypto space witnessed decent growth in price, which was more reflected in Bitcoin. You would agree with me that crypto is not just about the chain—it goes beyond the chain and includes various assets.

Let’s take a look at some of the biggest crypto categories and how they performed over the last week:

**Memecoins – Up 19.9%**

This area of Web3 serves little to no purpose but has become increasingly popular due to speculation and hype. Memecoins were up nearly 20%, reaching $62.1 billion in the seven days leading up to Friday, Oct. 18. Tokens like Book of MEME (BOME), TURBO, and Cat In A Dogs World (MEW) enjoyed weekly rises of more than 50%, indicating that crypto is in a strong place right now.


**L1s (Blockchains) – Up 11.3%**

Layer 1s are the largest Web3 category by market cap, worth over $1.8 trillion, with 68% of that made up of Bitcoin. The price of BTC is likely to continue surging as net flows into BTC ETFs increase. Earlier last week, there was a net inflow of over $1.8 billion.

**DePIN – Up 24.4%**

DePIN solutions allow blockchain technology to interact with physical infrastructure in industries like storage, communications, and energy. As one of this year’s crypto buzz sectors, DePIN coins and tokens had a great week, rising nearly 25% to $23 billion. We may see more growth if speculation continues and if the likes of Peaq launch this month or next. With over 46+ DePIN projects building on the chain, substantial funds have already been raised for token launches. If Peaq, one of the key DePIN-focused L1s, goes live, we may witness many of these solutions launching. This sector has solid potential and room for more growth.

**Proof-of-Stake – Up 8.8%**

The Proof-of-Stake sector climbed 8.8% to $549.9 billion last week, driven by an Aptos (APT) token unlock and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin laying out his goals for Ethereum’s Surge.

**L2 Scaling Solutions – Up 6%**

Layer-2 solutions saw a solid performance last week, growing to $19.5 billion, partly due to Bitcoin Layer-2 Stacks (STX) being listed on the Nexo crypto exchange and many others as well. 

I hope this week brings even more promising developments and price action to last week.

Stacks (STX): An Overview,Nexo,1g5nuif,2024-10-17 06:35:52,2,0.67,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexo/comments/1g5nuif/stacks_stx_an_overview/,NexoFinance,,"Stacks (STX) is now available on Nexo! Let's delve deeper.

Stacks introduces smart contracts and dApps directly to the Bitcoin network. Stacks' architecture is tailored for scalability and complex functionalities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, supporting a variety of applications from DeFi to NFTs and beyond.

The unique Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism anchors Stacks to Bitcoin, ensuring robustness while enabling participants to earn BTC by ""stacking"" STX. This feature not only leverages Bitcoin’s security but also rewards Stacks holders in a widely accepted currency.

STX, the ecosystem's native token, facilitates executing smart contracts, processing transactions, and participating in network governance, making it central to both utility and community engagement.

Weird price action on $stx stacks Binance - Anyone Else experienced This? ,stacks,1g2glbn,2024-10-12 23:12:56,3,0.8,7,https://i.redd.it/jlv4aqssxfud1.jpeg,OldTiger57,Exchanges,"Hey all, I’m trading on Binance, and I encountered something strange with $STX. I had a stop loss set at 1.537, and out of nowhere, the price dropped from 1.75 to 1.53 for just a moment, which triggered my stop. Right after, the price jumped back up to 1.73.

I’ve checked different sources, but I can’t find any data reflecting such a sudden drop. I know price volatility can happen, but this is the second time I’ve experienced this on Binance (the first time was with $WIF).

Has anyone else experienced weird price spikes or manipulation on Binance recently? Could this be a liquidity issue or something related to market depth? Would love to hear if others have had similar experiences or insight into what’s going on!

Grayscale Names 20 Cryptocurrencies with Growth Potential for Q4,web3news,1fs69qu,2024-09-29 10:58:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/web3news/comments/1fs69qu/grayscale_names_20_cryptocurrencies_with_growth/,Then_Dragonfly2734,,"https://preview.redd.it/ip8h3lttirrd1.jpg?width=955&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb9bc32d137b9ad32bd99fa73344b5861aefa6af

Each quarter, Grayscale's research team analyzes hundreds of cryptocurrencies and updates their list of tokens primed for growth.

In their latest top 20 cryptocurrencies, Grayscale included tokens they believe have ""significant potential in the upcoming quarter."" By the end of Q3, six new cryptocurrencies were added to the list of top-performing assets.

""We analyze factors such as network growth and adoption, potential catalysts, the stability of fundamentals, token valuation, supply inflation, and potential risks,"" Grayscale explained.

The newcomers include:

* **SUI**: The native token of the Sui blockchain. After a network upgrade, Sui’s transaction speed increased by 80%, surpassing even Solana's capabilities.
* **Bittensor**: This protocol simplifies the integration of AI and digital assets. In the past month, TAO's price surged by nearly 70%. According to experts, the project has become one of the standout players in the AI sector.
* **Optimism**: A Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, featuring the Superchain framework. Optimism’s development is already being used in Coinbase's L2 Base network.
* **Helium**: A leader in the decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) sector. The project now boasts over a million hotspots and 100,000 subscribers. The platform has generated more than $2 million in network fees.
* **Celo**: This blockchain is transitioning to Ethereum’s Layer 2. Developers are focusing on stablecoins and payment solutions in emerging markets, where the project is growing in popularity. By daily stablecoin transactions, it already surpasses Tron.
* **UMA**: The latest addition to Grayscale’s top 20. UMA is an oracle network utilized by the major prediction market Polymarket.

Other key players in Grayscale’s ranking include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). Following the third quarter, some assets were removed from the list, including Render (RND), Mantle (MNT), ThorChain (RUNE), Pendle (PENDLE), Illuvium (ILV), and Raydium (RAY).

Finally, Grayscale analysts highlighted the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their heightened volatility and urging investors to exercise caution."

Personally, I’m extremely optimistic about Stacks. The potential is massive. Stacks uniquely enables smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to be built on Bitcoin, combining Bitcoin’s security with the flexibility of programmable applications. What really stands out to me is the ability to earn BTC rewards through Stacking, which leverages Bitcoin's Proof of Transfer (PoX) mechanism. It allows STX holders to earn Bitcoin by locking up their tokens and helping to secure the network.

I’m continuously growing my STX holdings and genuinely wonder why Stacks hasn’t received as much attention as I believe it deserves. It’s not just another blockchain—it’s built on Bitcoin, the most secure network in the world, which gives it a real competitive edge in terms of long-term sustainability.

What about you? What strategies are you using?  
Personally, I love taking advantage of dips in Stacks’ price. They provide great opportunities to accumulate more STX, and the higher my STX balance, the greater the BTC rewards I can earn through Stacking. The Stacks ecosystem is still evolving, with a growing number of projects like CityCoins, Arkadiko, and various NFTs, which makes it an exciting time to get involved.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and strategies! Let's build and grow together!"

Trend Following Analysis of Stacks (STX) Cryptocurrency  
  
Abstract  
  
This abstract outlines a comprehensive analysis focusing on the application of trend following strategies to Stacks (STX), a cryptocurrency integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain, aimed at enhancing smart contract functionalities. The study delves into STX's market dynamics through a multi-faceted approach, incorporating historical price trends, fundamental analysis, and technical indicators tailored for trend following. We explore how moving averages, trend lines, and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD can be effectively utilized to identify and capitalize on STX's price movements. The analysis extends to real-world case studies, examining both successful trend following trades and learning from failures, providing practical insights into risk management specific to STX's volatility. Additionally, we consider the psychological aspects of trading STX and the impact of technological updates and regulatory news on trend following strategies. By integrating data from X posts and broader market sentiment, this study aims to offer a nuanced understanding of how trend following can be optimized for STX, contributing to the strategic investment decisions within the volatile cryptocurrency market.

### Revolutionizing Bitcoin: The Introduction of Stacks’ Nakamoto Upgrade

A New Era for Stacks and Bitcoin IntegrationStacks, a⁣ pioneering blockchain ‌network operating as a second layer to Bitcoin, has initiated a significant system enhancement ‍known as the Nakamoto⁣ upgrade.⁤ This ‍progressive development aims to both accelerate transaction‌ speeds and refine overall network efficiency.

Understanding‌ the Nakamoto Upgrade ‍Uniquely named after‍ the enigmatic‍ founder⁣ of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, this ⁤upgrade is ‌set to transform how‌ transactions are managed within the Stacks ecosystem. Primarily,‌ it will segregate Stacks’ block production⁤ from the timing constraints inherently⁣ tied to Bitcoin’s own schedule. By establishing⁣ a more ​autonomous operation schedule, Stacks aims to better streamline its processes independently of Bitcoin’s.

Implementation Timeline and Technological AdvancementsThe transition period provided for network contributors ‌encompasses a critical​ two-week timeframe dedicated for necessary adaptations. Post this phase, these changes will be solidified via ‍a hard fork—an event celebrated in blockchain technologies for marking significant evolutionary ‌steps in networks’ lifespans. The cornerstone of ⁣the Nakamoto’s implementation lies in its innovative proof-of-transfer consensus ⁣mechanism which permits participants—termed ‘miners’—to engage directly by burning bitcoin⁤ (BTC). This action facilitates their opportunity in mining new blocks on Stacks while earning rewards‌ proportionate to their contributions.

During April’s commencement stages of adoption, ‘signers’,​ responsible individuals within the governance framework of this technology began ⁢validating what are referred to as ⁣’tenures’. These tenures⁤ describe specific​ durations wherein⁤ miners‍ have rights assigned towards producing multiple blocks eventually consolidated ‌onto Bitcoin’s ledger.

Enhanced⁤ Functionality Through New AssetsIn conjunction ⁢with enhancing fundamental structures, Stacks is also unveiling sBTC—a novel asset aimed at bridging BTC ⁤into its broader ecosystem thereby fostering⁤ greater interoperability between these leading cryptographic ⁣platforms. The focus rests on tapping into extended ⁢functionalities such ​as smart contracts and decentralized⁣ financial⁤ operations that​ leverage bitcoin as foundational support.

Despite reflecting⁣ innovation and growth potential within crypto landscapes ⁢marked by STX token’s recent 8% drop amidst prevalent market ⁣downtrends—such​ fluctuations portray‌ common investment risks associated ⁢with volatile digital assets markets.

### Sector-Wide Implications

These advancements signify not only technological leaps but ⁢also ‌highlight evolving⁣ market dynamics influenced by digital assets’⁤ integration across various⁢ sectors including finance regulation among⁤ others being spectated globally today thus redefining⁣ engagement methodologies existing under traditional ‍financial premises⁢ far beyond mere asset‌ exchange mechanisms paving paths toward genuinely‍ decentralized⁢ economic infrastructures built atop unwavering transparency principles ingrained within blockchain technology cores.
