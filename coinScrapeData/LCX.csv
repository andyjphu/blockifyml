Big crossovers and cameos of pairings and/or characters in the 188 group universe,SQC_188,1i8vkh1,2025-01-24 08:38:19,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQC_188/comments/1i8vkh1/big_crossovers_and_cameos_of_pairings_andor/,rollercoaster-s,Question,"Hi everyone, hope you guys are doing great! So as a disclaimer: I haven't finished all the 188 novels yet. However, I am suddenly wondering if there's anything similar to what happened in the ILWAI extra where the main CP meet both SQ and LCX (main CP from Sissy) and see one day of their daily lives.

To make it clearer, I got two questions:

1- **Are there any extras (or part of the main story) from any novel where the main couple meets another main couple (from 188)**, besides the ILWAI extra where they meet Sissy's CP and the Sissy extra with the WTA's CP (and I'm guessing this happens in WTA too)? Basically I want to know if there has been another ocassion where **two (or more) CPs interact all at the same time**.

2- **What are other big cameos in other 188 novels**, besides the example of WTA (Sissy characters cameos that are important to the story). I'm thinking of **interactions that are long and/or meaningful, not only mentions**. I already know about:

* The PBD couple in YOI but they appear separately in those scenes iirrc.
* BE's shou (and mentions of ML) in YOI. I'm in the middle of YOI so idk if gong actually appears later.
* The PBD gong appearing in one or two chapters from AP.
* AI's MC visiting SQ and LCX's house and just AI and Sissy characters doing cameos in one another because they're tied at certain points.

*Anything else besides that?* I'd really appreciate if you could lmk! I found a similar post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQC_188/s/Eg9tJnuo83) but my questions are a bit more specific (sorry üò≠). In case this has been discussed before or there's any list of all the cameos elsewhere, that also helps and please lmk ü•∫üôè. Thank you so much as always!"

LAD artery with 50-69% mixed plaque and 25-50% mixed plaque: What should be my maximum heart rate and what should I be cautious about?
Question
Hello everyone, I am a 50-year-old male with coronary artery disease. My journey began 10 years ago with a diagnosis of myocardial bridge in my LAD artery. At the time, my son was just born, and I went to the hospital with chest pain, thinking it might be anxiety. After stress tests and a CT angiography (which I insisted on), the bridge diagnosis was confirmed. My calcium score was 0.

After that, I started having yearly check-ups. Five years later, another CT angiography showed a mixed plaque in the middle segment of my LAD artery causing approximately 30% stenosis. My doctor said it wasn‚Äôt significant and advised me to stay active and live my life.

Fast forward five more years to the present. At my latest check-up, instead of a stress test, my doctor recommended a myocardial perfusion scan (MPS). The MPS showed a mild ischemia of 4% on the right side of the heart during stress, but no ischemia at rest. My doctor prescribed 2 mg pitavastatin (Alipza) and coraspirin and reassured me that the issue might not be related to the LAD artery, suggesting a repeat CT angiography for confirmation.

At the start of this process, my LDL was 98. My blood sugar was normal, and my blood pressure was on the low side (110/70). At that time, I was smoking about one pack of cigarettes a day. For the past six months, I‚Äôve been walking 6,000-12,000 steps daily at a moderate pace or swimming for 30 minutes per day.

After the CT angiography, I was shocked by the results. It reported:

25% stenosis in the LCX artery

Two separate regions in the LAD artery with mixed plaques, causing 25-50% and 50-69% stenosis.

My calcium score is now 81.7. I felt devastated when I saw the report, as I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this bad. My LDL has since dropped to 20 due to the statin treatment. I‚Äôve also significantly reduced smoking; now, I only occasionally smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day without inhaling, and I use a low-wattage e-cigarette with no nicotine during cravings.

My questions are:

How stable are these plaques?

My doctor advised me to avoid heavy exertion and said heart rate management is crucial. But I‚Äôm now scared to even walk briskly. During a moderately paced walk, my heart rate rises to 100-120 bpm, and playing around with my son makes me anxious.

I have heavy suitcases (20-30 kg), and I‚Äôm afraid to lift them. How long does it take for plaques to stabilize with statin and coraspirin treatment?

When can I feel more at ease? I can‚Äôt live my life constantly checking my heart rate.

On top of everything, I experience various pains in my left shoulder blade or chest, which I‚Äôm not sure are due to anxiety or my heart. Reading others‚Äô experiences here has been comforting, and I feel less alone.

I appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Your input means a lot to me‚Äîthank you!"

Dad 56M has 90% blockages in 3 arteries. They say CABG is not viable neither is stenting. In distress.,askCardiology,1i8nukc,2025-01-24 00:00:21,8,0.91,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8nukc,cheems_die,,"Hi all, my dad 56M, has angiography done 3 days ago(21/01/2025). The cardiologist said that CABG/surgery might nor be possible for now since the structure of the arteries doesn't allow for the same now. Even took him to a cardiac surgeon later on who said the same, he said something on the lines of ""The place where the graft is to be rejoined is not properly visible/the artery is a little thin on that end"". I might not be relaying information very accurately here, this is what I understood from them.

They both said it will be a MFU(Medical follow up) where probably he'll be on medicines and tests will be conducted at regular intervals for monitoring. He is diabetic. He did not have any problems breathing/woth heart before this. It started from 17th Jan where he felt congestion in chest area and breathing problems after which we rushed him to hospital. Additionally the chest x-ray showed some clouds and they said he also had mild pneumonia. The cardiologits also said that he did have a heart attack in the past but he didn't have any pain or anything as such.

My major concerns and his symptoms:
1. He eats, and is not able to digest and vomits sometimes.
2. Oxygen levels in blood have fluctuated in 2 events since 17th. On 17th when he was admitted they were at 37% spO2.
3. Is medical follow up like we can't do anything, its all upto fate? Or does something similar happen to other patients also. This is what scares me the most, since once he is discharged at home we can't do much if his oxygen levels start dropping or any other emergency occurs.

Please help a son out. Need some advice and thoughts on the same.
I am 24 M.

Attaching angiography report for reference."

Update: Coronary CT angiography with contrast results,CathLabLounge,1i7cmn7,2025-01-22 09:43:15,1,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CathLabLounge/comments/1i7cmn7/update_coronary_ct_angiography_with_contrast/,VioletAML,,"A couple weeks ago I posted year old cardiac cath results of a family member. The folks here were so knowledgeable and kind to help explain those results to me (retired RN). That cath was in Jan 2024. The 67 y/o pt is presently having increasingly severe periodic angina. Yesterday they had a CT angiography with contrast.  These are the results posted this morning. Is there anything fixable? Do you think they can be helped?  Does another heart cath seem imminent in their future?  Is there anything that might be stented that could alleviate their discomfort?  They have rejected another open heart surgery.  Any information shared is for educational purposes only.  I really just want to understand better.  Thank you again to all of you.  You are appreciated!!!

Turns out I had a small heart attack about 18 years ago around age 30 (I know why and why it was then). 

Current symptoms: easily fatigue during heavy workloads, some sexual performance issues, lots of flutters and palpitations. Anxiety is high. BP has been hard to control forever - always elevated no matter what meds we tried but was always considered well controlled at 130/80ish. (When I finally went after said incident) 

Currently taking losartan 50mg and just added mlodipine 5mg. Seeing a cardiologist this weds. 

PERFUSION:
ABNORMAL myocardial perfusion.
Large mixed perfusion abnormality of moderate to severe intensity in the basal-apical anterior/anteroseptal/anterolateral, and apical walls.
 
FUNCTION:
Overall left ventricular systolic function was abnormal without wall motion abnormalities.
Moderate reduction in LV systolic function, rest ejection fraction = 38%
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction improved as expected with stress.
 
FLOW:
RPP corrected resting myocardial blood flow is normal.
RPP corrected stress myocardial blood flow is blunted in the LAD and LCX territories and normal in the RCA territory with normal myocardial blood flow reserve.
Global LV score of 2.0 indicating adequate vasodilator response.
 
CORONARY CALCIUM:
Semi-quantitative calcium score is not performed due to previous scoring performed in the last 6 months.."

I have been out of the home-lab / server game for a bit, and am looking to get a decent home-lab system up.  I currently have $500 to work with, but may throw a little extra in for additional hardware.

*What is currently in use*:  
\- AMD Ryzen 3 2200G  
\- A320 Motherboard  
\- 32GB DDR4 - 2400 RAM  
\- 800 Watt PSU

\- Jellyfin  
\- Plex  
\- Cloudflared  
\- Pi Hole w/ Unbound

Essentially I'm looking to beef this machine up, or invest in other equipment so I can do more with it.  Mainly, I want to throw up a few VMs, Game Server or two, and host my existing services on it.  Will also use it for learning new skills, as one should.  That and probably swap from TrueNAS Scale as bare-metal to a LCX / Service so it's not eating all my ram up for ZFS.

Anyone have any ideas / suggestions?

AMP has been designed as a low-volatility collateral token that continuously appreciates in value as a direct result of its utility. It mirrors a shift toward open token networks wherein users create and derive all intrinsic platform value through endogenous economic incentives. [u/ampera\_xyz](https://x.com/ampera_xyz)

Ultimately, this model is more cost efficient and productive than existing business models. Amp  
employs simple and transparent financial primitives (e.g., fixed supply, rudimentary staking  
mechanics), and avoids complicated synthetic or derivative instruments, rebasing mechanisms,  
multi-asset algorithmic models, and artificial constraints that are overly complex to users. Instead,  
Amp focuses on providing high-quality collateral, stability, and self-sustaining characteristics to  
create exponentially more utility."

Cloudflare access for Wireguard on Proxmox,Proxmox,1i3o75r,2025-01-17 14:14:46,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1i3o75r/cloudflare_access_for_wireguard_on_proxmox/,Nird91,Question,"Hello everyone, I have a Proxmox installation with a VM (Home Assistant) and an LCX (Wireguard).  
Everything is working fine, I am here to better understand how to optimize access through Cloudflare.

Currently, to have remote access to both applications, I have created two subdomains on Cloudflare, such as: homeassistant.mysite.com and wireguard.mysite.com.

On Home Assistant, I have installed two things:

1 - The Cloudflare addon ([https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared)) that creates the tunnel for ""homeassistant.mysite.com"".

2 - The Cloudflare integration ([https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cloudflare/](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cloudflare/)) that updates the DNS records for ""wireguard.mysite.com"".

I repeat, everything is working. The problem could arise if the Home Assistant VM is turned off, as the Cloudflare integration would stop updating the DNS records, which would cause me to lose access to Wireguard as well.

How can I solve this issue? Are there better configurations for Cloudflare?

I would like to understand if it is possible to create a specific tunnel for Wireguard, or if I should create a single tunnel in an LCX container. I can‚Äôt figure out how to optimize it. Thank you."

Primarily, AVA functions as the key to accessing the AVA Smart Program, a web3 loyalty program that provides use cases to end users, such as loyalty rewards, discounts, gated access benefits, AVA bonuses and more. The token is also used as a payment alternative for purchasing goods and services on partner platforms and as a governance tool for the AVA community.  
  
The overarching mission of the AVA Foundation is to create a decentralised, self-sufficient, and interconnected blockchain-based loyalty ecosystem with AVA at its core. The AVA Foundation aims to realise this mission by introducing the AVA Smart Program to partner projects in a cost-effective manner via a plug-and-play approach that provides participants with significantly greater utility, transparency, and autonomy over their rewards.  
  
This approach cultivates an accessible and more frictionless experience by enabling users to benefit from a range of partner projects via a single loyalty program ecosystem, thus generating more use cases, bringing communities together, and amplifying the reach of the AVA token."

LCX system resource allocation recommendations?,Proxmox,1i1bsxb,2025-01-14 12:46:57,5,1.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1i1bsxb/lcx_system_resource_allocation_recommendations/,mlee12382,Question,"I just bought a Beelink Mini S13 with the N150 and 16gb DDR4 that I'm going to be running Proxmox on.

The main use of the system is going to be for Jellyfin with hardware transcoding with the igpu. What are the recommended resource allocations? Is it overkill to assign the whole 16gb and 4 cores to the LCX?

I will also be running a few lighter VMs for things like nginx and wireguard and possibly a vm for the windows 11 image that comes with the pc but that won't be running all the time.if I do set it up.

This will be my first time running a Proxmox system."

What is the recommended resource allocation when setting up the Jellyfin LCX? Should I give it access to the full 16gb of RAM and all 4 cores or is that overkill? I do plan on running hardware transcoding with the integrated igpu. I will also be setting up some other low resource VMs for other network utilities like nginx and wireguard. I may run the stock windows 11 drive in a vm also but I haven't decided on that for sure and that won't be running all the time if I do.


Are there any differences I should be aware of between the Debian 12 and Ubuntu implementations of Jellyfin? If not I will be staying with Debian as that's what I'm used to using."
