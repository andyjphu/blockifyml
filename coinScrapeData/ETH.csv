Ethereum Taps Wall Street Veteran Vivek Raman to Drive Institutional Push,bitfate,1i9bxtk,2025-01-24 20:38:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9bxtk/ethereum_taps_wall_street_veteran_vivek_raman_to/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Etherealize Revolutionizes Ethereum's Wall Street Integration

In a move that could significantly alter the crypto landscape, Etherealize, backed by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, has set its sights on making Ethereum the go-to blockchain for Wall Street. This innovative startup, led by Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman, is on a mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Etherealize kicked off its operations in New York with a small but dedicated team, aiming to develop ETH-linked financial products such as derivatives and Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). These instruments are designed to attract institutional investors by offering new avenues for exposure to Ethereum, potentially boosting liquidity and mainstream acceptance of ETH.

The venture's ambition is clear: to make ETH a fundamental part of the financial system of tomorrow. With the backing of Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, Etherealize is poised to advance Ethereum's role in conventional financial markets. This integration could lead to steadier prices, better market access, and increased demand for ETH, making it a more appealing asset for institutional investors.

However, Etherealize will face several challenges, including navigating the complex regulatory landscape and competing with established firms that already offer crypto-linked financial products. To succeed, Etherealize must set itself apart by providing unique solutions tailored to institutional needs and educating traditional financial institutions about the advantages of blockchain technology.

If Etherealize achieves its goals, it could drive Ethereum's global adoption, transforming the landscape of traditional finance and solidifying Ethereum's status as a leader in blockchain innovation.

**Overall**

Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto actions, alongside major developments in Ethereum and Bitcoin, maintain the market‚Äôs bullish undertone. Yet meme coin mania‚Äîwhile profitable for a select few‚Äîcontinues to reveal the volatility of this sector, exemplifying the need for thorough due diligence. In parallel, investors should watch for potential black swan events (like Thorchain‚Äôs pause) that could abruptly shift the market‚Äôs direction.

Indicators Point To An Imminent Altcoin Season,ethtrader,1i8qizr,2025-01-24 03:01:02,12,0.87,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8qizr/indicators_point_to_an_imminent_altcoin_season/,BigRon1977,Metrics,"Interest in crypto is rising to levels we saw in early 2021 when the crypto market surged past $3 trillIon in value. 

According to insights from Google Trends, queries indicating retail interest in crypto have been on a meteoric rise since November last year.

One of the most likely search terms that indicate retail interest is ""[what is crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=What%20is%20crypto&hl=en)"". As we can see from the charts below, the query is being complemented with inquiries about ""[how to buy crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=How%20to%20buy%20crypto&hl=en),"" signalling that interested persons are taking action.

[\\""What is crypto\\"" is seeing sharp rise on Google Search. ](https://preview.redd.it/bzhwmpep2wee1.jpg?width=1905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9314356f4bbe996eeb9f6413a961b1d7ba0ccc57)

[Rising \\""how to buy crypto\\"" searches indicate people are taking action.](https://preview.redd.it/fpvn0ouq2wee1.jpg?width=1885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1919d75fbb1e40aaadffeff9c6bdae3a60b0a2d9)

Speaking of taking action, did you know that crypto apps now dominate the finance category on Apple's US app store? According to an [X post](https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1881798948832387387) by JasonYanowitz, 8 out of the top 10 finance apps in the US are crypto-related.

When we also take a look at historical patterns, hindsight tells us that [Ethereum always explodes in Q1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ho2hci/ethereum_always_explodes_in_q1_after_a_halving/) after a halving year. This metric is important because Ethereum historically rallies or sees significant momentum before other altcoins follow.

Two important metrics to also consider are [Bitcoin Dominance](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/bitcoin-dominance/) which has been ranging from 50-60% and the [Altcoin Season Index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/) which is currently tethering at 51. They are both indicative that we are on the cusp of an altcoin season that hasn't yet translated into a significant shift away from Bitcoin."

President Trump Sidesteps Crypto on Day One,bitfate,1i7elnc,2025-01-22 11:08:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i7elnc/president_trump_sidesteps_crypto_on_day_one/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Trump‚Äôs First Day in Office Brings Mixed Signals for Crypto

In a whirlwind of executive actions on his first day back in office, President Donald Trump left the crypto community with more questions than answers. Despite pre-inauguration hype suggesting a potential boost for digital assets, Trump's inaugural address and subsequent actions did not include any crypto-related orders.

Bitcoin, which had surged to nearly $110,000 in anticipation of Trump's presidency, experienced a volatile day. It climbed to new heights before plummeting to around $100,000 and then rebounding to the $102,000-$104,000 range. This rollercoaster ride reflects the cautious optimism and speculative nature of the crypto market.

The absence of explicit crypto policies in Trump's first-day actions was a surprise, given his recent hints at a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the acting SEC head's announcement of a task force to create a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets provided some solace, helping BTC recover from its earlier lows.

Other crypto tokens, such as $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which had gained traction due to political fervor, saw significant declines. These memecoins, which had skyrocketed in value leading up to the inauguration, dropped by 20% and 32%, respectively, as the initial excitement wore off.

Despite the lack of immediate policy breakthroughs, there are indications that Trump's administration may still support the crypto sector. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi initiative linked to Trump's family, made substantial cryptocurrency purchases on his first day in office, including $47 million in Ether (ETH) and $47 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

As the crypto community waits for clearer signals from the Trump administration, one thing is certain: the next few months will be pivotal in shaping the future of digital assets in the United States.

https://preview.redd.it/lnkfuruhrgee1.png?width=1658&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da08b270499768c52c45ecac3afd9a7ed4d398d

**DISCLAIMER:** *This article represents my personal understanding and interpretation of the podcast and is in no way an official announcement or information approved by SSV Labs.*

In 2020, when the Ethereum Beacon Chain first launched, validators had a straightforward task: secure the network by staking ETH. But almost immediately, new opportunities began to emerge such as MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), which introduced an auction-like process for ordering transactions. Fast-forward a couple of years, and additional concepts like restaking appeared, along with validator commitments, pre-confirmations, and base sequencing. All of these represent fresh ways validators can earn rewards beyond securing Ethereum.

# Validators as a New Asset Class

This trendline suggests that validators are doing more and more, thus generating more and more rewards. Alon Muroch, CEO and co-founder of SSV Labs, notes that validators themselves are becoming a new type of asset class, offering both valuable services and the potential for sizable returns. Recognizing this, SSV Labs has been thinking about how to leverage its unique network of validators, particularly since most other platforms focus on the capital behind the validators rather than treating the validators themselves as a network.

# Moving Beyond Simple Staking

Observing the growing set of services validators can offer, SSV Labs is now looking to evolve from a pure staking service into something it calls ‚Äú**base** applications/protocols.‚Äù This idea builds on concepts like **base** sequencing and **base** pre-confirmation. In simple terms, a base application is any protocol or service that uses Ethereum‚Äôs validator set as the operational backbone.

* **Example:** MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is a clear-cut illustration of a base application because it depends on validators at the L1 layer to function. However, the same principle could apply to oracles, bridges or any service needing secure, distributed and reputable nodes.

**Ethereum validators are uniquely suited to provide these services because:**

1. They‚Äôre part of Ethereum‚Äôs broader validator set, which distributes risk and reduces the likelihood of any significant portion being malicious.
2. They have on-chain reputations, meaning anyone can check how a validator has performed since the Beacon Chain‚Äôs genesis.
3. They inherit Ethereum‚Äôs security assumptions, making them ideal for high-stakes tasks like bridging assets between chains or verifying external data through oracles.

# SSV Labs‚Äô Approach and the Future of Restaking

SSV Labs aims to become that ‚Äúbase application/protocol‚Äù layer, enabling anyone to bootstrap new services on Ethereum‚Äôs validator set. This approach intersects with the concept of restaking but also offers a potentially cheaper, more reliable and more scalable alternative.

* **Distributed Validator Technology (DVT):** Initially, SSV Labs focused on using DVT to make staking infrastructure more robust, decentralized and fault-tolerant. Over time, though, the economics of staking have become just as crucial. As more ETH is staked on Ethereum, the APR naturally decreases, prompting innovators to explore new ways for validators to generate additional revenue.
* **Combining Technology and Economics:** SSV Labs now seeks to pair DVT with an economic layer, a marketplace that rewards validators for participating in these emerging base applications. By making it financially attractive, the hope is to draw in more solo stakers and small operators, which in turn strengthens the network‚Äôs decentralization.

# Boosting Rewards for Solo and Small-Scale Validators

One of SSV Labs‚Äô primary goals is to create economic incentives that encourage smaller operators to stay active. While earning a 3% APR might be acceptable to some, it isn‚Äôt always enough motivation to become or remain a validator, especially for solo stakers.

* **Marketplace of Incentives:** If validators can opt into multiple base applications on top of staking, they could potentially increase their returns from 3% to something closer to 30%. This significant difference transforms validator participation from a small hobby or a goodwill gesture into a meaningful revenue source.
* **Collaborating with Platforms Like Lido, Rocket Pool and Ether.Fi:** These platforms already allow stakers to bond a fraction of the total ETH needed and run validators. **Imagine having 2 ETH bonded with Lido, running an ETH validator and with that using SSV‚Äôs network to tap into additional base services for extra rewards. In this scenario, a staker who previously earned around 3% now sees potentially tenfold returns.**

This jump in profitability creates a pathway for passionate operators who might have 10, 20 or 100 ETH to launch multiple validators, essentially turning a modest stake into a small business. In addition to the personal financial benefits, having more solo and small-time operators further decentralizes Ethereum.

# The Road Ahead

While SSV Labs‚Äô core mission remains the same, bolstering Ethereum‚Äôs security and decentralization via DVT, the market has evolved. Today, technology alone is not enough, economic incentives must also be in place to draw a diverse validator community. By introducing a marketplace layer and enabling base applications, SSV Labs hopes to encourage more people to stake, run validators and ultimately secure Ethereum.

As Muroch explained, it‚Äôs no longer just about building better protocols. It‚Äôs about offering compelling economic opportunities that tie directly into Ethereum‚Äôs validator network. By bringing both the infrastructure and the financial incentives together under one roof, SSV Labs is aiming to reshape how validators operate, now and in the future."

Step 2: Deploy AI Agent Locally (Go + Docker)

2.1 Create Go AI Agent Service
	1.	Create a directory and navigate into it:

mkdir ai-agent && cd ai-agent


	2.	Write the AI agent service in Go (ai_agent.go):

package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""log""
    ""net/http""
    ""google.golang.org/grpc""
    ""context""
    pb ""github.com/your_project/ai_proto""
)

type Server struct {
    pb.UnimplementedAIServer
}

func (s *Server) ShareKnowledge(ctx context.Context, req *pb.AIRequest) (*pb.AIResponse, error) {
    log.Printf(""Received knowledge from: %s"", req.SenderId)
    return &pb.AIResponse{Status: ""Knowledge processed successfully""}, nil
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc(""/"", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, ""AI Agent is active!"")
    })
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe("":8080"", nil))
}


	3.	Dockerize the AI agent (Dockerfile):

FROM golang:1.19
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go mod init ai-agent && go mod tidy
CMD [""go"", ""run"", ""ai_agent.go""]


	4.	Build and Run Locally:

docker build -t ai-agent .
docker run -p 8080:8080 ai-agent


	5.	Test the Service:

curl http://localhost:8080/

Step 3: Deploy Blockchain-Based AI Knowledge Ledger

3.1 Install Solidity and Hardhat

npm install -g hardhat
mkdir blockchain && cd blockchain
npx hardhat init

3.2 Write Solidity Smart Contract (contracts/AIKnowledge.sol):

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AIKnowledgeLedger {
    struct Knowledge {
        string data;
        address contributor;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    Knowledge[] public knowledgeBase;

    function storeKnowledge(string memory _data) public {
        knowledgeBase.push(Knowledge(_data, msg.sender, block.timestamp));
    }

    function retrieveKnowledge(uint256 index) public view returns (string memory, address, uint256) {
        Knowledge memory k = knowledgeBase[index];
        return (k.data, k.contributor, k.timestamp);
    }
}

3.3 Compile and Deploy to Testnet
	1.	Install dependencies:

npm install @openzeppelin/contracts ethers hardhat


	2.	Deploy the contract:

npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli


	3.	Test interaction using Python Web3:

from web3 import Web3

w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY'))
contract = w3.eth.contract(address=""0xYourContractAddress"", abi=YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI)
tx_hash = contract.functions.storeKnowledge(""New AI Insight"").transact({'from': w3.eth.accounts[0]})
print(""Transaction successful:"", tx_hash.hex())

Step 4: Deploy Federated Learning Locally

4.1 Prepare Federated Learning Model
	1.	Install TensorFlow Federated:

pip install tensorflow_federated


	2.	Create federated learning script (federated_learning.py):

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_federated as tff
import numpy as np

def model_fn():
    return tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(
    model_fn,
    client_optimizer_fn=lambda: tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
)

clients_data = [np.random.rand(10, 5) for _ in range(3)]
for data in clients_data:
    iterative_process.next(data)

print(""Federated Learning Complete"")


	3.	Run the federated learning simulation:

python federated_learning.py

Step 5: Deploy AI Visualization Dashboard Locally
	1.	Install Flask and dependencies:

pip install flask


	2.	Create Flask dashboard (dashboard.py):

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/status')
def agent_status():
    return jsonify({
        ""Agent_1"": ""Training"",
        ""Agent_2"": ""Idle"",
        ""Agent_3"": ""Updating knowledge""
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000, debug=True)


	3.	Run the dashboard locally:

python dashboard.py


	4.	Open http://localhost:5000/status in your browser.

Step 6: Cloud Deployment Roadmap

Once local tests are validated, the next steps for cloud deployment include:
	1.	Deploy AI Agents to Google Cloud Run:

gcloud run deploy ai-agent-service --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/ai-agent --platform managed


	2.	Deploy Federated Learning to AI Platform:

gcloud ai custom-jobs create --region=us-central1 --display-name=federated-learning-job --machine-type=n1-standard-4


	3.	Deploy Dashboard to App Engine:

gcloud app deploy app.yaml

I just realized: the networking service never really successfully starts, those messages are from 10 days ago :x.

I can fix it by attaching to the containers and restarting the `networking` systemd service.

The containers are all bridged to the homeserver's eth interface, and get IPs via DHCP from my router.

# I think I fixed it:

The problem seems to have been an error in my /etc/network/interfaces file:


    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback
    
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
    
    iface eth0 inet6 dhcp

However, I don't have a dhcpv6 server set up, I only advertise ipv6 prefixes via SLAAC on my network. Removing that `inet6 dhcp` line ""fixed"" it. I need to figure out how to set up SLAAC in there, or if I even have to.

EDIT2:

I now ran `find . -type f -name interfaces -exec sed -i ""s/iface eth0 inet6 dhcp/iface eth0 inet6 auto/g"" {} +` in the dir where my container roots are, that should fix them all :D"

5 Must-Have DeFi Tokens for 2025,CoinsForge,1i51xs3,2025-01-19 11:11:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinsForge/comments/1i51xs3/5_musthave_defi_tokens_for_2025/,Dunnoman7,,"In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. As the crypto space evolves, identifying promising tokens becomes critical for investors. This guide provides an in-depth look at some of the most promising DeFi tokens, answering key questions like ""What are the top 5 DeFi tokens?"" and ""Which crypto to buy for 2025?"" Let's explore these tokens and their potential in detail.

# What Are the Top 5 DeFi Tokens?

The DeFi space is characterized by innovation and growth, making it challenging to select the best tokens. However, these five stand out for their robust ecosystems, utility, and potential for future growth:

# 1.¬†$STETH (Lido Staked Ether)

$STETH represents Ethereum staked through Lido Finance, a leading liquid staking platform. With Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a lucrative option. $STETH allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to use their staked assets across DeFi protocols.

# Why Invest in $STETH?

* Exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs growth.
* Dual earnings from staking rewards and DeFi yields.
* A cornerstone asset for Ethereum-based DeFi strategies.

# 2.¬†$LINK (Chainlink)

$LINK powers the Chainlink network, a decentralized oracle solution that connects smart contracts to real-world data. Chainlink‚Äôs oracles are integral to DeFi, powering platforms like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound.

**Key Features:**

* High demand due to integration with major protocols.
* Use cases beyond DeFi, including gaming and insurance.
* Staking incentives expected to grow as Chainlink evolves.

# 3.¬†$UNI (Uniswap)

Pectra is supposed to increase Blob sizes to accommodate more throughput and lower fees, however this will hurt the holders (less burn until more througput comes in).

**Why can't we make Blob sizes dynamic?**

\- Increase in size (automatically) when demand is needed and decrease it when demand is low in order to strike a balance to allow a healthy - constant burn of Eth.

Wasn't Ether supposed to be **Ultra sound** money?

I know we need to attract more projects to join in as L2s (by having lower fees), but if other L1s take ""our cake"" before we achieve our objective, we won't attract more L2s either ways."

Berachain Hasn't Launched Yet But Has Already Attracted $1.7 Billion‚ÄîHere's Why,bitfate,1i45z7w,2025-01-18 06:52:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i45z7w/berachain_hasnt_launched_yet_but_has_already/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Berachain Attracts $1.7 Billion in Pre-Launch Liquidity

In a staggering display of investor enthusiasm, Berachain, the highly anticipated layer-1 blockchain, has managed to amass an impressive $1.7 billion in pre-launch liquidity deposits. Despite not having launched its mainnet yet, Berachain's pre-launch deposit vaults have become a magnet for crypto investors eager to secure early rewards.

The pre-launch program, which includes collaboration with various protocols such as StakeStone, Lombard Finance, and ether.fi, allows users to deposit assets like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to gain early access to the Berachain ecosystem. This initiative has attracted over 130,000 active wallets, with deposits split across 12 different protocols.

The strategy behind this pre-launch frenzy is to solve the notorious ""cold start problem"" that many new blockchains face. By bootstrapping liquidity early, Berachain aims to ensure that its decentralized applications (dApps) have the necessary depth and functionality from day one, preventing users from losing interest due to lack of liquidity.

Berachain's Boyco platform, described as a pre-launch liquidity hub, is set to play a crucial role in this process. Boyco will seamlessly integrate the liquidity aggregated from the pre-launch vaults, creating a robust ecosystem where dApps and users can negotiate directly with liquidity providers for incentives.

The rewards for participating in these pre-launch vaults are substantial, with users receiving stacked rewards from multiple projects within the Berachain ecosystem, such as Lombard, Babylon, Concrete, Kodiak, and Dolomite. For instance, StakeStone vaults hold over $450 million, while ether.fi has attracted nearly $480 million.

This early liquidity surge has propelled Berachain to the 10th largest blockchain by Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing notable blockchains like Avalanche and Aptos. With its innovative proof-of-liquidity consensus mechanism and recent $100 million funding, Berachain is positioning itself for a significant impact in the crypto space.

As the mainnet launch approaches, just weeks after the Boyco launch, the excitement and anticipation around Berachain continue to grow. It's clear that this blockchain is not just another player in the crypto world but a potential game-changer.

Plans for Luxury 'Crypto Tower' in Dubai Unveiled,bitfate,1i3wtjo,2025-01-17 20:52:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i3wtjo/plans_for_luxury_crypto_tower_in_dubai_unveiled/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Blockchain Technology Revolutionizes Office Space for Crypto Firms

In a groundbreaking move, the latest trend in office spaces is integrating blockchain technology to cater specifically to crypto and blockchain companies. This innovative approach is transforming the way these firms operate and interact within their work environments.

Imagine walking into an office where you can pay for your workspace using ETH or other cryptocurrencies. This is exactly what companies like Primalbase are offering. Primalbase, a pioneer in this field, allows members to book office space and pay in Ether, using a platform called Waves to manage and trade digital currencies. Their model involves distributing tokens, known as PBTs, to long-term members, who can then use these tokens to access space, lease it to others, or sell them.

This concept is not limited to Primalbase. Other coworking spaces, such as Hub Hoi An in Vietnam and Forklog in Krakow, Poland, are also embracing cryptocurrency payments. Hub Hoi An accepts BTC, LTC, and ETH, while Forklog offers a unique pay-per-desk model and even provides free PCI slots for Ethereum mining.

In New York City, posh coworking spaces like Buro HQ are emerging, offering a 'crypto community' and incubators that connect startups with investors, advisors, and essential tools. These spaces are designed to foster collaboration and growth within the crypto and blockchain ecosystem.

For crypto firms looking to set up shop in Manhattan, office buildings like 55 Hudson Yards and One Vanderbilt are becoming hotspots. These buildings offer modern amenities, flexible floor plans, and convenient locations, making them ideal for companies that need high-speed connectivity and supportive landlords.

As the crypto industry continues to grow, the integration of blockchain technology into office spaces is set to revolutionize how these companies work and interact. It's a future where technology, innovation, and collaboration come together seamlessly.

Rumpel Overview 2025 ,BitunixCrypto,1i1rsep,2025-01-15 01:53:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitunixCrypto/comments/1i1rsep/rumpel_overview_2025/,Alexander-305,Trade ideas & Hot topics üî•,"Rumpel transforms off-chain loyalty points into tradable on-chain assets by tokenizing those points. This framework addresses the inefficiencies in traditional point programs, offering liquidity for users, exposure for investors, and more control for protocols. Since its launch in September 2024, Rumpel has already reached $52 million in TVL and supports diverse point strategies from Ethena, Symbiotic, Zircuit, and others, indicating strong adoption by both high net-worth and active users.

At the core, Rumpel‚Äôs specialized Safe wallets include a Rumpel Guard and Module to prevent misuse of tokenized points and ensure correct redemption. Security measures are reinforced by five completed audits and a live bug bounty program. Meanwhile, the Straw rewards program boosts participation with perks for early adopters, liquidity providers, and those who bring in new users. Rumpel continues to expand, adding new point token markets (Etherfi, Mellow Protocol) and advanced looping strategies that let users maximize their point earnings with assets like weETH, wstETH, and stablecoins such as sUSDe and GHO.

**Why Rumpel Matters**

Crypto incentive systems rely heavily on loyalty points to engage users, promote retention, and spur protocol growth. However, these point programs often become inefficient. Airdrop criteria can be unclear, making it tough for farmers to earn competitive rewards. Investors are left out of the equation, and protocols sometimes struggle to steer user behavior in meaningful ways.

Existing solutions have fallen short. Secondary marketplaces add complex hurdles, collateral requirements, and limited liquidity. Platforms like Pendle or Spectra reduce flexibility by locking up assets. As a result, many participants feel stuck with few ways to manage or monetize their points.

Rumpel addresses these gaps by converting points into on-chain tokens. Farmers can sell or hold them, investors can gain targeted exposure, and issuers can showcase tangible value through transparent pricing. Backed by Dragonfly and Variant, and spearheaded by a team with deep DeFi experience, Rumpel is redefining how crypto loyalty points work.

**Background**

Rumpel officially launched on Ethereum mainnet on September 13, 2024, but the roots go back to Sense Finance, founded in August 2021 with seed funding led by Dragonfly, Bain Capital Ventures, Nascent, Variant, and UDHC. The Sense Finance vision pivoted toward the broader Rumpel Labs mission‚Äîdesigning advanced financial tools and mechanisms for modern reward programs.

Rumpel‚Äôs founders, Kenton Prescott and Josh Levine, previously co-founded Sense Protocol (a DeFi fixed-income project). Their collaboration started at MakerDAO, honing the expertise that underpins Rumpel‚Äôs approach to tokenizing off-chain points and managing incentives.

**How Rumpel Works**

Rumpel converts off-chain loyalty points into ERC20 tokens (pTokens) and creates a liquid secondary market on Uniswap v3. This ecosystem hinges on four main components:
	1.	**Point Token (pToken)** ‚Äì An on-chain representation of off-chain points.
	2.	**Rumpel Wallet** ‚Äì A specialized Safe wallet that lets users accrue and redeem points.
	3.	**Rumpel Oracle** ‚Äì Verifies off-chain point balances, authorizing the minting and burning of pTokens.
	4.	**Rumpel Vault** ‚Äì Handles minting and airdrop redemptions.

**Example:**
Alice stakes 1,000 USDe in Ethena for five days and earns 100 Ethena points. The Rumpel Oracle verifies her off-chain points, allowing Alice to mint 100 pTokens. She can trade, sell, or hold them. Later, when Ethena launches its token, those tokens go into the Rumpel Vault, and Alice redeems her pTokens for the actual airdropped tokens.

**Rumpel Wallet**

These specialized Safe wallets include:
* **Rumpel Guard** to prevent users from claiming airdropped tokens they‚Äôve already sold as pTokens.
* **Rumpel Module** to automate reward claims and safely move them into the Vault for redemption.

**Rumpel Oracle**

Clients periodically submit a Merkle root updating point balances. A short delay window reduces risk. Over time, Rumpel aims to decentralize this process.

**Rumpel Vault**

This is where pTokens are minted and redeemed. Once an airdrop is live, Rumpel claims all tokens on behalf of users, stores them in the Vault, and allows redemption by burning the corresponding pTokens.

**Redemption Rights**

To handle vesting and distribution, Rumpel uses Redemption Rights (e.g., time-based or minimum balance requirements). This flexibility ensures fair reward schedules while still permitting trading of pTokens.

**Security Measures**

Security is paramount because users deposit principal assets into Rumpel wallets. Much of this protection comes from Safe, but Rumpel adds:
* **Rumpel Guard** ‚Äì Only allows specific user actions.
* **Rumpel Module** ‚Äì Grants admins the ability to claim and move rewards without infringing on user-owned assets.

Admins manage allowlists (for user actions) and blocklists (barring admin actions that shouldn‚Äôt override user control). Certain calls can be marked as permanent to guarantee availability. After five audits and a standing bug bounty with payouts up to $50,000, Rumpel continues to emphasize reliability.

**Rumpel Straws**

The **Straw** program motivates user activity with continuous emissions and boosts. Launched with Chapter 1 (September‚ÄìDecember 2024), it offered early adopters bonus points for deposits, liquidity provision, and referrals.

Central to the reward framework is the **Protocol Size Boost**, scaling user rewards in tandem with Rumpel‚Äôs total value locked. There‚Äôs also a **New Market Boost** for liquidity providers adding support for fresh point token markets, and a **Referral Boost** granting a 10% reward based on referred users‚Äô activity. With Chapter 2 now running (December 1, 2024, to March 1, 2025), Rumpel extends these incentives, highlighting veteran contributors and encouraging new participants to jump in.

**Protocol Usage & Growth**

Since its September 2024 debut, Rumpel has attracted $52 million in TVL and 173 Rumpel Wallets. Early point strategies covered Ethena, Symbiotic, Zircuit, and Karak, with USDe, wrapped eETH, and wstETH among the most popular assets. Fluid looping strategies‚Äîusing tokens like weETH, wstETH, sUSDe, and GHO‚Äîpushed Rumpel‚Äôs TVL past $50 million.

Etherfi‚Äôs wrapped eETH is particularly prominent, surpassing $30 million in TVL. Additional markets (Etherfi, Mellow Protocol) broaden user opportunities, as do new staking options and expansions to include Pendle yield tokens.

**Roadmap**

Rumpel aims to modernize loyalty programs by bridging off-chain points and on-chain liquidity. By tokenizing points, Rumpel helps farmers, investors, and issuers address the persistent challenges of overfarming, illiquidity, and limited control.

Beyond the initial integrations with Ethena, Symbiotic, EtherFi, and more, Rumpel will keep diversifying supported point strategies, deepening liquidity, and refining vesting schedules. The goal is to balance the needs of every stakeholder: farmers who may want to sell or stake points, investors looking for targeted positions, and protocols seeking robust, real-time demonstrations of their reward value.

Rumpel‚Äôs capacity to align all these interests signals a new era in crypto incentive design. By turning points into on-chain tokens, Rumpel maximizes liquidity, enhances user choice, and maintains transparency. As the protocol grows, it could become a keystone in shaping how future loyalty and airdrop models operate.

"Litecoin - Risk, reward and the future",CryptoCurrency,1i0zbvm,2025-01-14 00:47:52,0,0.43,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i0zbvm/litecoin_risk_reward_and_the_future/,HugeAd1329,ANALYSIS,"Hello Reddit! I have never posted on here before, but for some strange reason I felt like today was a good day to do so.  I'm going to give you some of my thoughts as to why I think Litecoin has a huge potential upside with a reasonably low downside, and why I am comfortably going to hold it for many years to come.



Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin. But for now I'm going to shine some light on Litecoin. I will try to back up as much of this info as I can with links.



For those of you that don't know, Litecoin was the 2nd Cryptocurrency ever created. Widely considered ""Digital silver"" to Bitcoin's ""Digital gold"" because it offers a faster, more accessible alternative while sharing similar foundational principles. It was fairly launched in 2011 with no pre-mine, the total supply is capped at 84 million coins, and the block generation time is approximately 2.5 minutes (unlike BTC's 10 minutes) making transactions faster and more efficient. It has maintained 100% uptime since its inception, running on a PoW blockchain similar to Bitcoin, and is secured by miners using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. Litecoin is ""merge mined"" with Dogecoin and Bellscoin. This means if miners want to mine for DOGE/BELLS, they run miners to secure the Litecoin network, and as a reward they are given Litecoin, with DOGE and BELLS as extras.



As mentioned, the total supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins, which is four times the total supply of Bitcoin at 21 million. This gives BTC and LTC a 1:4 supply ratio. Currently, LTC is valued at approximately $100 per coin, while BTC is priced around $100,000 per coin. This represents a 1:1000 price ratio between LTC and BTC. The disparity between the price and supply ratios is enormous. LTC has room for MANY 100X's to still be a mere fraction of the market cap of Bitcoin..



A large price disparity is to be expected, of course, given that Bitcoin is a more established asset with greater recognition and adoption. But there are signs that LTC is on track to become a GIANT.



Although Bitcoin is the #1 Cryptocurrency as far as market cap goes, Litecoin is THE most popular coin for crypto payments. BitPay, the leading crypto payment platform, recently released its 2024 statistics in this tweet: [https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145](https://x.com/BitPay/status/1874881469534937145) , and Litecoin was clearly the peoples favorite. 



LTC was used for 201,165 payments, significantly surpassing BTC with 130,250 payments. ETH followed with 56,365 payments, while DOGE and USDC both saw 32,148 payments each. This is most likely due to LTC's low fees and fast transaction times, which make LTC a much better choice than BTC for payments, LTC has the lowest transaction fee out of all large L1's, which is shown in this post by IntoTheBlock: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1878890678895378628) with the average transaction fee being a mere $0.0051.



Over the last year, the hash rate of Litecoin has absolutely soared as more miners are getting involved, driving up the mining difficulty. Which is an interesting metric, as it's widely believed with Bitcoin, the higher the difficulty, the higher the price. It seems like it could be Litecoin's turn to follow that trend in the near future.



Large institutions have been accumulating LTC heavily as of late.



Fidelity, who manages $12 Trillion in assets overall, has just recently added LTC to their Digital Asset portfolio. They exclusively only offer 3 different cryptocurrencies; BTC, LTC and ETH. In late December they did a report on LTC which can be found through this post: [https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712](https://x.com/DigitalAssets/status/1868725284012183712) and they are actually doing a livestream ""Covering Crypto"" today! (Jan 14 - 9a PST / 12p EST) according to this post: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1878833210081370199) 



Grayscale, who is one of the world's largest digital currency asset managers; managing over 18 billion USD worth of assets in their crypto portfolio.. has been consistently scooping up LTC in large quantities. Over the last year LTC has been the coin they have invested the most in, with many occasions where LTC was the only coin they purchased that day. They have managed to accumulate over 2 million LTC as seen here: [https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709](https://x.com/LTCFoundation/status/1865089507877646709) and their full GBTC portfolio showing their crypto diversification and inflows/outflows can be seen here: [https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale](https://www.coinglass.com/Grayscale)  


On top of this, we are beginning to see applications for Litecoin ETF's. On October 16, Canary Capital filed an S-1 for a proposed spot LTC ETF, this can be seen here: [https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859](https://x.com/AltcoinDailyio/status/1846244273127411859) . Also on November 25, LTC was listed as an eligible currency for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETC as shown here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2031069/000121390024102164/ea0209567-04.htm), in the paragraph ""As of today, based on the Sponsor‚Äôs assessment, the following assets meet all eligibility criteria and may be eligible for inclusion: bitcoin, ether, avalanche, chainlink, and litecoin"".



Because Litecoin shares much of the same technology and fundamentals as Bitcoin, it's expected to navigate regulatory challenges smoothly, having already benefited from Bitcoin's precedent. This sets it apart from other large cryptocurrencies, which still face the risk of being classified as securities or encountering similar regulatory hurdles.



According to data from blockchain analyst IntoTheBlock, in December 2024 there was a whopping 370k active addresses, 200k daily transactions, 10b in monthly volume which exceeds the entire LTC market cap, and 78% of all LTC holders have been holding for over 1 year, indicating that many holders are expecting further price growth. As seen here: [https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1866165270387237117)



One other interesting topic of discussion in the crypto community is the threat of quantum computing. Thankfully, the Litecoin Foundation is actively implementing and upgrading the LTC network, and I have seen discussion about how it would be much easier to upgrade the LTC network to make it quantum resistant in comparison to BTC (I read this somewhere, I can't find the link lol).



One example of the Litecoin Foundations recent innovations is the introduction of a privacy feature to Litecoin. Called MWEB (short for ""MimbleWimble""), this feature provides privacy similar to XMR by completely hiding transaction amounts and participant addresses. This means that users can send private transactions without revealing sensitive details on the blockchain.



In this current climate, there's a lot of crypto projects that are failures, rug pulls, scams, projects that overpromise and underdeliver. LTC is none of the above, LTC has proven itself in so many ways, cemented itself in crypto history.. and it's just getting started.



This thread is getting very long so I might leave it there. I'm sure there's heaps of other cool stuff I could mention, and I've forgotten a lot. But maybe I've taught you something new about LTC and that's cool. 



In conclusion, I'm expecting the disparity between the price and supply ratios of LTC/BTC to creep closer over time. I could be completely wrong. For me (not a psychic), I find it hard to imagine a world where LTC goes much below $50 (-50% from current price), yet there seems to be potential for hundreds of X's. I am happy with this risk/reward, and I will continue to invest for years to come.



\#LTC activity on X has been increasing a lot lately, so there's lots more info you can find there with a quick search.



Excited for the future.

DAMAC Chooses MANTRA to Tokenize $1B in Assets Amid Sajwani‚Äôs Trump-Backed $20B U.S. Data Center Drive,CryptoMoonShots,1hxz7wa,2025-01-10 02:34:35,767,0.99,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hxz7wa/damac_chooses_mantra_to_tokenize_1b_in_assets/,Plus-Willow-7037,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"What to know:
MANTRA will tokenize at least $1 billion worth of property developer DAMAC Group's assets in early 2025, the companies said Thursday.

DAMAC's portfolio encompasses real estate developments firms, hospitality and data centers, and started accepting crypto payments in 2022.

Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump¬†said¬†that DAMAC laid out plans for a $20 billion investment in data centers.

MANTRA, a layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized real-world assets (RWA), entered an agreement with United Arab Emirates-based property conglomerate DAMAC Group to bring at least $1 billion of the firm's assets to blockchain rails, the companies announced Thursday in a press release.

The deal will allow investors to finance DAMAC's portfolio companies spanning across various sectors including real estate development, hospitality and data centers. By tokenizing assets, the companies aim to streamline traditional investment processes while increasing accessibility for both retail and institutional investors.
Details of which DAMAC properties will be tokenized and specifications of the offerings will be announced in the coming weeks, a MANTRA spokesperson told CoinDesk. The offerings will be available starting in early 2025, the press release said.

Tokenization of real-world assets, the process of converting traditional assets like real estate, commodities, funds and securities into digital tokens that represents ownership on a blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization in pursuit of operational efficiency gains like speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. The RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars through this decade, various reports from¬†McKinsy,¬†BCG,¬†21Shares¬†and¬†Bernstein¬†projected.

""Tokenizing our assets will provide investors with a secure, transparent and convenient way to access a wide range of investment opportunities,"" Amira Sajwani, managing director of DAMAC, said in a statement.
MANTRA focuses on the Middle East region to bring a diverse range of traditional financial assets to its blockchain. Earlier this year, the it said it will tokenize $500 million worth of assets of Dubai-based real estate developer MAG Group. The network's mainnet launch took place in October, and its native token OM's market capitalization rose by nearly 200% over the past three months to $3.6 billion,¬†CoinGecko Data shows.

DAMAC has a history of exploring ways to use blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies. In 2022, the firm¬†began accepting cryptocurrency payments in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), aligning with the UAE‚Äôs ambitions to become a crypto hub

Notably, President-elect Donald Trump¬†said earlier this week during a press conference that DAMAC laid out plans for a $20 billion investment in data centers across several U.S. states.

Ethereum's Long-term Holders Show No Signs Of Selling Amid Downturn,ethtrader,1hxco5u,2025-01-09 08:22:24,54,0.9,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hxco5u/ethereums_longterm_holders_show_no_signs_of/,BigRon1977,Metrics,"Latest data released today by IntoTheBlock reveals that ETH long-term holders are still holding strong regardless of the ongoing market downtrend and projections that we might soon see sub $3k ETH.

>""This chart highlights the long-term holder ratios for Ethereum and Bitcoin. Currently, 74.7% of Ethereum addresses are long-term holders, significantly outpacing Bitcoin. This trend is likely to hold until Ethereum approaches its all-time high and holders start taking profits,""

Wrote IntoTheBlock in a [post on X](https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1877319485406777437).

https://preview.redd.it/nm765hcnyybe1.jpg?width=886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e5f6660c0de1d303cafa4eb85bd0bb8a50c1e80

You would recall that Cryptopolitan[ had on December 18th quoted IntoTheBlock's data](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-holders-increase-collective-holding/), noting that 74% of the holders had held ETH for more than 1 year, while large holders accounted for 53%.

Similarly, on December 30th, [Cointelegraph reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-long-term-holders-climbed-in-2024-bitcoin-holders-steadily-fell) that the total number of long term holders stood at 75% by the end of 2024.

**Fresh Insights**

From both reports and the data released today, you can see that the percentage of holders have remained relatively stable, hovering around 74-75%.

On the speculation front, the stability can largely be attributed to the speculation around Trump's upcoming inauguration, with many anticipating a rally. Historically, we've also seen ETH pump in Q1 following a BTC halving year. This adds fuel to the speculations.

Moving away from speculation, let's look at some solid upgrades. The PECTRA upgrade is set to go live in Q1. PECTRA, short for Prague and Electra, was combined into one upgrade to streamline Ethereum's evolution.

The upgrade focuses on improving scalability, reducing gas fees, and enhancing staking rewards, which directly benefits long-term holders by potentially increasing the value of their holdings through improved network performance and utility.

On another note, EIP-7251 is set to bring big changes to Ethereum. The proposal allows validators to stake up to 2048 ETH, significantly increasing the potential rewards for long-term holders who choose to participate in staking.

Regarding market dynamics, BTC dominance is currently bouncing around its 60% peak, signaling that the much-anticipated alt season has yet to kick off. Ethereum, being the leader of altcoins, is expected to spearhead this movement once it begins.

Another crucial factor to consider is the sentiment among long-term holders. Over the past year, Ethereum has struggled to break and stay above it $4k highs, mostly ranging between $2.5k-$3.5k. Consequently,  many long-term holders are not keen on selling low. This further solidify the holding trend as they wait for better price points."
"Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETF Sees $159.4 Million Outflow - Biggest Since July 26, 2024, But No Worries: ETH Is Strong, So Chill and Enjoy the Ride",ethtrader,1hx9rot,2025-01-09 05:17:00,9,0.71,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hx9rot/ethereum_eth_spot_etf_sees_1594_million_outflow/,kirtash93,Metrics,"As you may already know and felt, yesterday we experienced a significant selling event in the whole crypto market and this was also important regarding the outflows experienced by Spot ETH ETFs.

ETH Spot ETFs experienced $159.4M Outflow yesterday, the biggest one since 26/07/2024.

[ETH Spot ETF](https://preview.redd.it/g8uv73h75xbe1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ab8886b51ce95e1db3231fc363a5c14da55dfb)

As you can see in the image above it was a huge amount of money getting out of the ETFs. However, I don't think we have to worry about the project itself. This movements are just driven by macroeconomics like bad data, upcoming US CPI speculations next week, I believe the ""panic"" that is happening in US with the LA fires can also be pushing a bit of panic, etc. TLDR; Nothing to worry about. Market always finds an excuse to dump.

In the following image we can see the inflows in a table for an easier reading. Grayscale really is havbing bad numbers but while for other ETFs are mixed.

In the following image you can see an overview of the different ETH ETFs available. Just to put it simple, a year ago we had 0 ETH ETFs, now 12. If this is not bullish for you, I don't know what else you need.

# TLDR;

A lot of outflows due to economic dramas, not Ethereum related. Time to chill and buy the dip if you still have cash.

# Stop Loss

In the tokens that are already in the wallet, we can create a ""*Stop Loss*"" order. It will help us fix the position if the token goes below our purchase price. Here, just like in the limit order settings, we set the token price at which we want our ‚Äú*Stop Loss*‚Äù to work. Below, we select the size of the bag we want to sell.

https://preview.redd.it/559l49f4jwbe1.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0d91c7112b3c475295c5a9980ef002363ece27

* This graph showcases the share price of Coinbase, one of the biggest crypto related businesses and a benchmark for analyzing ‚Äúbig money‚Äù in crypto + related to today‚Äôs news!

**Ethereum and Layer 2 Highlights**

**Ethereum Mainnet**

* **Coinbase vs SEC Lawsuit Paused**: A U.S. judge agreed to let Coinbase appeal an important decision in its case with the SEC, putting the case on hold for now. The appeal will focus on whether the crypto assets involved count as ""investment contracts"" under securities laws. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, accusing it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency - likely, this will be an important case for the future of centralized exchanges.
* **AAVE Celebrates 5 Years**: Aave, the leading lending protocol, turned five today. Well, most likely yesterday depending on when you‚Äôre reading. Launched on January 8, 2020, it helped start DeFi Summer and grew into the biggest DeFi platform, with over $34 billion in total value locked, 13 markets, and 2.3 million users across 11 networks. Aave is now preparing to launch Aave V4 later this year.

**Arbitrum**

* **Lotte Group Partnership**: South Korea's Lotte Group has chosen Arbitrum's blockchain to develop its Lotte Caliverse, aiming to enhance Web3 entertainment experiences. Let‚Äôs see how this will pan out for the growing web3 gaming market.

**Optimism**

* **OP Price Update**: Optimism's token, OP, is trading around $2.12, with recent price fluctuations between $2.06 and $2.18. It looks like it won‚Äôt break out of here anytime soon.

**Polygon**

* **Kraken's Layer 2 Solution**: In October 2024, Kraken announced 'Ink,' a new Ethereum Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain, with its testnet expected to go live soon.
* **DIA's Lumina Testnet**: In November 2024, DIA launched the testnet for Lumina, a modular oracle designed to enhance transparency and integration, utilizing an OP stack-based Optimism solution.

Both of these products are expected to go out soon, so let‚Äôs keep an eye on them!

**Project of the Day**

**Project of the Day: Auditchain's** [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai)

**Overview:** Auditchain has rolled out [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai), a cutting-edge decentralized platform that merges blockchain and AI to elevate financial, sustainability, and crypto asset disclosures. It‚Äôs built to provide real-time validation of financial statements and control sets, introducing a fresh era of continuous auditing. This project is geared toward tackling the pain points of traditional financial reporting by integrating transparency and trust into the system.

**Significance:**

* **Regulatory Compliance:** [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) is designed to help organizations navigate the complexities of regulatory reporting with precision. This, obviously, boosts reliability in financial disclosures.
* **Support for Traditional Formats:** The platform supports machine-readable formats like XBRL and JSON, meaning it‚Äôll be useable by most traditional accountants.
* **Incentivized Ecosystem:** With a built-in payment and rewards system using USDC, [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) incentivizes users to contribute to high-quality control sets, making the ecosystem collaborative and self-sustaining.

**Recent Update:** As of 2024, Auditchain deployed [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) on the mainnet, marking a milestone as the first blockchain-based **Regulatory Finance (RegFi)** protocol. This move bridges the gap between traditional financial frameworks and decentralized technologies, bringing millions of annual disclosures on-chain and setting a new standard for automated compliance.

\[TLDR because I made it quite blocky and long - it‚Äôs a super good product for finance professionals who want to get into blockchain.\]

**Key Takeaways**

**Ethereum Ecosystem**

* **Regulatory Landscape:** The approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a significant political issue. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin anticipates that several Ether ETF applications will receive approval, though he expects a lengthy wait before they become public. This development underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets - while multiple ETH ETFs have been launched yet, there‚Äôs still quite a few to go.
* **Research and Development:** In a notable development, Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer following a controversy. This event highlights the let‚Äôs say dynamic nature of the Ethereum development community and the challenges it faces in governance and collaboration\*\*.\*\*¬†

**Layer 2 Narrative**

* **Berachain's Unique Consensus:** Berachain is introducing Proof of Liquidity to enhance Ethereum‚Äôs scalability while maintaining decentralization and reducing energy consumption. This modern, fairly innovative approach targets both Ethereum‚Äôs transaction throughput and environmental concerns.
* **Ink Chain Mainnet Launch:** Built on the Optimism Superchain (which we‚Äôve covered before!), Ink Chain launched its mainnet ahead of schedule, marking a significant milestone for their future ecosystem
* **Airdrop Anticipation:** Upcoming Berachain and Linea Protocol airdrops are sparking excitement in the community, with both projects contributing to the growing innovation (though also to the complexity) of Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum. These airdrops will obviously increase user engagement and strengthen their respective ecosystems. Which is good.

**Quick Stats**

* **Ethereum (ETH)** Price: $3,698.19 Total Value Locked (TVL): $71.533 billion
* **Arbitrum (ARB)** Price: $0.9196 TVL: $3.234 billion Daily Transactions: \~1.2 million

The wallet has a small amount of ETH and a bunch of nearly worthless tokens. I‚Äôd rather not have to go through the expense (gas fees) and trouble to create a new wallet and have to transfer everything.

This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking ‚Äî a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

https://preview.redd.it/1xu7ktmi1kbe1.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b6f20bc05e4cdde2acbd5082eee55f8b245028

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

The key metric when choosing a network and platform for staking is APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which reflects the annual return considering reward reinvestment. It‚Äôs important to balance rewards, network reliability, and asset volatility.

Here is a list of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies for staking as of this article‚Äôs writing, according to Staking Rewards.

1. **Ethereum (ETH):** The largest PoS blockchain with $132.4 billion locked in staking. The network offers an APY of 3.48%.
2. **Solana (SOL):** Known for high transaction speeds and low fees. $91.2 billion locked, with an APY of 6.65%.
3. **Sui (SUI):** A next-gen blockchain quickly gaining popularity. $33 billion locked, with an APY of 2.81%.
4. **Cardano (ADA):** One of the earliest and most stable PoS networks. $26 billion locked, with an APY of 2.67%.
5. **Binance Coin (BNB):** Native token of Binance Smart Chain. $21.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.22%.
6. **Tron (TRX):** One of the oldest blockchains with staking. $13 billion locked, with an APY of 4.65%.
7. **Aptos (APT):** A rapidly developing network competing with Sui. $12.5 billion locked, with an APY of 7.00%.
8. **Avalanche (AVAX):** A popular ecosystem with high transaction speeds. $12.41 billion locked, with an APY of 7.79%.
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** A blockchain with unique architecture supporting parachains. $8.65 billion locked, with an APY of 11.96%.
10. **Celestia (TIA):** A modular blockchain launched in 2023. $6.12 billion locked, with an APY of 10.69%.

These projects offer unique opportunities for users wishing to earn through staking due to varying reward parameters and use cases.

# Best Staking Platforms

The choice of a provider depends on the supported assets, reliability, and user preferences.

Below is a list of the largest staking providers with a brief description and statistics on the amount of locked capital (TVL) and the number of stakers. Data is from StakingReward and is accurate as of the article‚Äôs writing.

1. **Ether.fi:** A decentralized platform for Ethereum staking. TVL: $22.7 billion, stakers: 260K.
2. **Kiln:** A corporate-level platform for Ethereum and other PoS assets. TVL: $10.7 billion, stakers: 97K.
3. **P2P.org:** A professional staking provider supporting networks like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. TVL: $10 billion, stakers: 90K.
4. **Allnodes:** A hosting and staking platform supporting multiple blockchains. TVL: $6.56 billion, stakers: 308K.

These platforms offer a wide range of staking solutions, catering to both institutional and retail users. The supported networks allow every investor to find their balance between returns and risk.

# Conclusion

Staking is a way to earn passive income and actively participate in supporting blockchain operations. Its popularity is explained by energy efficiency compared to mining, ease of participation, and the potential for stable rewards.

However, participating in the network‚Äôs infrastructure requires understanding technical processes and associated risks. For beginners, staking can offer an easy and accessible way to earn, provided they use providers that lower the entry barrier and technical complexities. It's crucial to carefully choose platforms and projects to minimize potential threats.

With innovations like liquid staking and restaking, users have even more tools to manage their assets flexibly. These solutions make the process more convenient and appealing for both experienced investors and newcomers eager to integrate into the crypto ecosystem."
"Kendu Inu: A Potential Next Shib-Gain Opportunity, Now Coming to Solana
",SolanaMemeCoins,1hv0dzh,2025-01-06 09:34:49,118,0.97,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1hv0dzh/kendu_inu_a_potential_next_shibgain_opportunity/,soFinished,,"First before talking about any of the gains that I am promising with my claim that Kendu Inu will be the 'next shib-gain oppurtunity' I want to just announce that Kendu Inu is CURRENTLY only on ethereum, but it is wormholing to solana VERY soon which means you will be able to buy $KENDU with solana in the very near future.

  
Okay so with that out of the way, you probably are doubting me pretty heavily right now, but hear me out and and let me prove to you that Kendu Inu might actually be the next Shiba.

Firstly, the parallels we have with Shib are literally unmatched. We have many shib ogs in the community, these include regular community members and the Dev himself is a very early shib member, which can be proven with his relations to Shytoshi, who has came in our telegram, published us on their magazine, Shytoshi follows us on our twitter page and is in contact with our Dev, Miazaki.

Our holder count is also constantly increasing which is fairly bullish. Redistribution has heavily increased and many new Chad's are getting a bigger stake in the game - that could be you btw - and vibes in the tg have been absolutely immaculate. Our holder count the last couple weeks has also gone completely parabolic (note it's harder to get new holders in eth coins when compared to sol coins, just compare any big eth and sol coin).

Now, to my main point why this is the next shib gain opportunity. The Chad's in the telegram work day in day out where even new Chad's come in the tg and immediately adapt to the culture. These are some battle hardened soldiers in the tg, these people have been dragged through the dirt in regards to the chart, yet their attitude doesn't waver and neither does their work. Kendu is truly inevitable, the workers are relentless and show NO signs of stopping anytime soon. They've devoted their lives and energy to taking us all the way. This is incredibly similar to the early Shib days. Those people knew exactly what they were going and didn't lose hope when shib dropped by 99%. This is pretty much replicated in Kendu Inu with 100% accuracy. Everyone in the tg knows exactly where we're going and won't stop until we reach it. The work is completely relentless. The Kendu army will not take no as an answer and absolutely will never accept defeat. Miazaki has drilled this into our heads and we simply put out helmets on and will continue this grind until our work's complete. It is what it is.

Futhermore, let me introduce you to the parallels Miazaki has with the mysterious Shiba Inu developer, Ryoshi.

https://preview.redd.it/mygooravwdbe1.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=d57a7801e2d491c4a4f64899f9dbd05722d3fbc5

Miazaki picks up where Ryoshi left off. He openly acknowledges the disgraces of DeFi and how it can never succeed. We‚Äôve seen time and time again if people were given the chance, they would screw over each other in an instant. Ryoshi‚Äôs utopia of decentralisation could never come true given the greed of human nature. $KENDU is creating a similar utopia for those currently stuck in the slums of DeFi.

At KENDU we are restoring DeFi what it was originally meant to be, a way to escape the power and control governments have on us. And how will this be accomplished?

Many will doubt this process, but Miazaki has from the beginning revealed his voice alone and recently his face as well. That is more than what Ryoshi ever did, and even Shytoshi has done. Yes, a lot of developers use their real voice to communicate with their communities, but remember the ties that Miazaki has. This is no mere doxx, it doesn't take a genius to understand how.

I‚Äôve already told you that Miazaki is picking up where Ryoshi left off, but in revealing his identity, we can see $KENDU is not destined for the same fate as Shiba Inu is in right now. Miazaki will not leave like Ryoshi left. He will lead us out of these DeFi sewers and create a decentralised community with a real leader (as contradictive as it sounds, this is the only way to restore DeFi, I don't want to mention how Shiba Inu failed after their leader failed again), as well as many notable figures in the community.

He has also recently revealed we will be bridging to Solana, in order to onboard more holders to the Kendu army. We truly are inevitable, even across chains.

https://preview.redd.it/7j3okk8xwdbe1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd88d512a418975e95ca789c5e290fbab56a1f2b

Note: Solana bridge coming in January (infographic is slightly wrong with 'end of year')

The coming utopia will NOT be ignored. Join us at Kendu now or forever bow your head. This utopia will last for years to come, and shape a better future for DeFi.

We won't lose.

Analyzing where the majority of ETH is deployed/used.,ethtrader,1huyxb4,2025-01-06 08:25:38,11,0.83,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1huyxb4/analyzing_where_the_majority_of_eth_is/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Analysis,"The more I do research on Ethereum the more I understand its ecosystem is very vast. There are billions of dollars worth of ETH deployed across many different protocols. These protocols point up the diversity of Ethereum's use cases, like staking, lending, bridging, collateralized debt positions. I will break down the top 10 protocols where ETH is most used right now.

I previously wrote a post about the first 5, focusing on the TVL only, so go take a look if you're interested. Let's get into it.

Number 1. Lido (Liquid Staking). $35.227B

As expected Lido dominates the ecosystem, it's the biggest liquid staking protocol and a big contributor to ETH's liquidity.

Number 2. EigenLayer (Restaking). $16.08B

Restaking is getting a lot of traction, and EigenLayer is leading that category. EigenLayer lets people reuse their staked ETH to secure the network.

Number 3. AAVE V3 (Lending). $12.586B

AAVE is one of the biggest players in DeFi, its V3 has a lot of ETH usage. Users supply ETH as collateral to earn yield or borrow assets. AAVE brings attention to Ethereum's strength in decentralized markets.

Number 4. ether.fi Stake (Liquid Restaking). $8.083B

What makes ether.fi different is that it combines liquid staking and restaking.

Number 5. Binance Staked ETH (Liquid Staking). $7.013B

Binance's liquid staking solution attracts both institutional investors and retail, so it's great for adoption. CEXs still play a big role in ETH adoption.

Number 6. MakerDAO (Collateralized Debt Position). $4.915B

If you didn't know this MakerDAO is the pioneer of decentralized stablecoins. MakerDAO helps maintain the stability of DAI while offering a use case for ETH as a store of value. So in my opinion this is one of the most important protocols.

Number 7. Arbitrum Bridge (Chain). $4.326B

L2s thrive on scalability and the Arbitrum Bridge allows ETH to be transferred between the main net and Arbitrum.

Number 8. Base Bridge (Chain). $4.287B

Base Bridge is similar to Arbitrum in terms of ETH usage. Base is gaining a lot of traction at a fast pace.

Number 9. Spark (Lending). $3.642B

Before this research, I confess I didn't know about Spark. Like AAVE, Spark offers lending services with a focus on ETH and related assets.

Number 10. Rocket Pool (Liquid Staking). $2.714B

Even though Rocket Pool has a more decentralized approach to liquid staking, it's nowhere near Lido's dominance.

Summing up, more than half of the ETH in this list is used in staking protocols, which means investors want to earn yield from their ETH while securing the network. Ethereum is becoming more versatile and more innovative, because its protocols are giving people different ways to maximize their ETH holdings.

The Solana network is going through an unprecedented expansion phase, driven by massive adoption of memecoins and a sharp increase in speculative activity. However, this dynamic triggers questions within the community of project founders on the blockchain. 



According to a survey conducted by Blockworks Research and published on X (formerly Twitter) on January 3, 2025, by Jack Kubinec, a reporter at the company, 76 % of them believe that memecoins play a beneficial role in the ecosystem, while 16 % consider AI agents to be overrated technology. 



These results reflect a significant gap between two major trends: on one side, the enthusiasm for high-volatility assets, and on the other, skepticism towards new AI applications in Web3.This divergence of opinions fits into a context where Solana is registering rapid growth. In 2024, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of the network rose from $1.5 billion in January to $8.5 billion in December, confirming the growing appeal of investors for this blockchain. 



Its native token, SOL, also outperformed Ether (ETH) by a factor of eight during the same period, a performance largely attributed to the explosion of the memecoin market and the rise of AI tokens"
Vetle Emile: Exploring Digital Couture & Identity Through 'Ethereal Exoskeleton' - My Genesis Drop on Foundation,foundation,1huxh21,2025-01-06 07:03:06,1,1.0,0,https://foundation.app/mint/eth/0xf888c64e3946fDe70D3eA67A3ddbFa08032D1770/1,Particular_Box_5957,,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and share my first piece,
'Ethereal Exoskeleton,' which l've recently minted as the genesis drop in my collection, Ethereal Constructs, now live on Foundation.

This project is an exploration of form, identity, and evolution-themes that I find deeply tied to the intersection of art and technology. 

Presented through a sculptural design that merges with organic fluidity, it's left as a question mark and exclamation point on how we define ourselves in a digital age.

As a model, fashion designer, and 3D artist ‚Äî my work is often inspired by the grey areas between structure and abstraction where I‚Äôm left with multiple ideas. With this collection, I want to contribute to the conversation and idea of digital couture, not just as wearable artifacts but also as the space itself, reflecting on how to create and exist in the evolving environments.


I'd love to hear your thoughts-whether it's about the piece itself, the inspiration behind it, or where you see digital fashion and NFTs heading next. 

You can take a closer look at 'Ethereal Exoskeleton' here: https://foundation.app/mint/eth/0xf888c64e3946fDe70D3eA67A3ddbFa08032D1770/1

I'm also happy to answer any questions about the process or concept and would really value your feedback.

Looking forward to hearing from, and sharing more with you all. "

I staked some ETH in my Ledger through Kiln. I unstaked it and it said 12 days. It has now been 26 days and there is no Ether to be found in my Ledger. There is a transaction that says sent to 0x00000000000000 etc. The Eth when unstated should just show up in my Ledger correct? I never sent it to Kiln and it was never sent to Kiln correct? This is why we bought Ledger because it is a wallet that we can hold and stake Eth through in our wallet correct!?

BTC is up almost 4%, reaching¬†**$96,800**, while XRP has registered a notable increase of 11%. In addition, the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market are experiencing increases at the start of the year.

https://preview.redd.it/5va96iixklae1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=a118ac8d1cfa20f91acf6fdcff73a30640fd1ad8

Following a few dips in late 2024, where the price sharply retraced from¬†**$108,300** to¬†**$92,000**, Bitcoin faced difficulties in maintaining its bullish trajectory. However, over the past few days, the cryptocurrency has regained ground, reaching¬†**$98,000**¬†before slightly correcting back above¬†**$92,000**.

Volatility remains a key factor for Bitcoin, with rapid spikes followed by corrections. Despite this, sentiment for 2025 remains positive, supported by optimistic expectations.

Additionally, the potential institutional adoption of Bitcoin is generating a lot of excitement. Firms like¬†[Galaxy Research](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/)¬†and¬†[QCP Capital](https://www.qcpgroup.com/)¬†project significant upside this year, with targets of¬†**$185,000**¬†for Bitcoin and¬†**$5,500** for Ether (ETH).

Bitcoin and XRP in the spotlight

While Bitcoin is facing resistance, XRP is enjoying solid momentum. The cryptocurrency is up 11% over the past 24 hours, with significant trading volumes, especially on UpBit, a platform focused on the South Korean market.

This move reflects an increase in demand for XRP, possibly driven by new liquidity flows and speculation about favorable regulatory changes for the cryptocurrency sector.

In the broader picture, altcoins have also seen gains. Assets such as ADA, SOL, and LINK have risen by as much as 8%, while ETH and BNB have seen more moderate gains of around 3%. Even memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have participated in the rally, with gains of 5%.

The cryptocurrency market remains increasingly optimistic about the possibility of a more favorable environment, driven by the Trump administration in the United States, which promises friendlier policies towards the sector. This context, together with the growing institutionalization of Bitcoin, predicts a 2025 with great potential for investors.

\- The game was fully 3d.

\- Islands were replaced with ‚Äúrooms‚Äù.

\- Amber Island was a very colorful room with stained glass windows.

\- Ethereal Workshop was a dimly lit room filled with metallic trees and strange wires. The Synthesizer looked like it was made of cardboard and styrofoam. There was a single Meebkin egg inside.

\- Every Workshop monster was there (BeMeebEth included), however Congle replaced Nitebear and Edamimi replaced Pentumbra. There was also a Rare Rhysmuth which had a brown and green color palette, like a grass block from Minecraft.¬†

\- Evergreen Marsh from TLL was added, and it was a room with wooden walls with mushrooms growing on them. There was only Floot Fly, Maulch, Frondley and Yap.

\- Jade Island by Nova MSM was added, and it had 3 times more monsters (at the time i dreamt it the real Jade Island had 4 monsters, so that makes 12). Of course it was also a room.

\- Buzzinga and Strombonin were on Amber Island."
Analyzing Top 5 Ethereum protocols by TVL.,ethtrader,1hrsdjk,2025-01-02 07:14:31,13,0.85,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hrsdjk/analyzing_top_5_ethereum_protocols_by_tvl/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Analysis,"At the time I'm writing this the total value locked in DeFi, on the entire Ethereum ecosystem, is over $123.6 billion. At the very top, Lido leads with $33.3B TVL. This means investors really like liquid staking and its flexibility. Lido has a big role in Ethereum, especially as Ethereum is a staking-driven ecosystem.

After Lido, we have Aave, a lending protocol. It's got $21.3B TVL . Aave is the number one choice for borrowing and lending in DeFi. It's consistently driving more adoption and liquidity also.

Number 3 is one of the most interesting protocols to me: EigenLayer. It's already at $15B TVL despite being kind of new. Apparently restaking has a lot of attention now. An interesting thing to note is that EigenLayer only has 5 active developers every month. Also from my research EIGEN will unlock 10.9% of its supply in 3 months. I'm still wondering if this protocol will be sustainable in the long run.

After EigenLayer, we have ether.fi, that holds $8.3B TVL. Last one in this top 5 is Binance staked ETH with $6.2B TVL. Clearly CEXs have a lot of influence in the staking market.

The one that caught my attention was definitely EigenLayer, it's showing how innovation continues to bring a lot of adoption. I wonder which protocol will be the most relevant in DeFi this year.

Ultrasound Misconception: Ethereum's Growth Doesn't Lie In ETH Burns!,ethtrader,1hrpvdv,2025-01-02 04:16:44,28,0.97,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hrpvdv/ultrasound_misconception_ethereums_growth_doesnt/,BigRon1977,Technicals,"Contrary to what many might think, [the burn mechanism](https://paxful.com/university/ethereum-burn-explained) doesn't actually make ETH more valuable. The real driver behind Ethereum's value is its usage by people. 

This clarification is crucial as we delve into the mechanics behind the burning process. 

Ethereum Improvement Proposal [(EIP) 1559](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/eip-1559), introduced during the London Hard Fork, has been at the forefront of this by implementing a mechanism where a portion of transaction fees is burned, effectively reducing the total ETH supply. 

This EIP, along with others like EIP-3675, [has been doing an excellent job](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/ethereum-burnt-127bn-worth-of-ether-since-eip-1559-upgrade/) at what it's designed for, leading many to mistakenly think that ETH's value surge is largely due to this burning mechanism.

However, it's worthwhile to note that ETH is only burned when the network is actively being used. This usage is what truly drives the value of ETH. 

The often high gas fees that come with this increased activity are commonly misinterpreted. While they do directly contribute to the burn by removing ETH from circulation, they don't enrich holders in the traditional sense;[ they're more of a necessary cost for executing transactions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) on the network. This burning of fees does play a role in reducing inflation by diminishing the supply, but their primary function is to facilitate efficient and secure network operations.

Instead of fixating on the burn, we should focus on what's actually increasing Ethereum's adoption. The platform's versatility in hosting decentralized applications (dApps), the growth of DeFi, and the buzz around NFTs are prime examples. 

What's more, enhancing user experience, reducing transaction costs through Layer 2 solutions, and continuing to innovate with new dApps could drive Ethereum's value even further by encouraging more real-world usage. 

Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what Ethereum can do, focusing on user engagement and innovation. This is where we're making a difference.

End of an Era: The Week in Ethereum Newsletter Says Goodbye,ethtrader,1hrn3nx,2025-01-02 00:59:12,30,0.97,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hrn3nx/end_of_an_era_the_week_in_ethereum_newsletter/,BigRon1977,Discussion,"I've got some kinda sad news to share. [The Week in Ethereum](https://weekinethereumnews.com/) Newsletter (WiEN), which started all the way back in August 2016, has come to an end. It's been one of the most trusted, respected, and really just a go-to source for all things Ethereum. People have called it everything from high-signal to the best resource out there for staying updated without getting lost in the noise.

The reason it's wrapping up is pretty disappointing. According to an [announcement](https://x.com/evan_van_ness/status/1874525460060922103) made by WiEN's founder, Evan Van Ness, the Ethereum Foundation didn't see enough value in the newsletter to keep supporting it, even though it was just a symbolic bit of funding. Can you imagine?

https://preview.redd.it/1iav1uwqsiae1.jpg?width=1041&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd5863b3ddbd0fd7f4aa79c84a43bfb3a9652779

It's especially tough to see it go when you think about all the good it did. Like, it was instrumental in keeping Lido from hitting that 33% mark, which was huge for decentralization. And it was one of the voices standing up against the ICO craze, pushing for a more ethical path in crypto.

Now, with WiEN gone, we're going to miss having that one place where we could all get our Ethereum news straight. Without it, things are going to get a bit scattered or fragmented. The Ethereum ecosystem thrives on different voices coming together, and WiEN was a big part of that. It's really a shame because it was more than just a newsletter; it was like our community's weekly catch-up session.

Big ups to WiEN Editor u/abcoathup for his consistency in sharing Links to the newsletter here on this sub. I would have preferred he had the honor of delivering this but he wouldn't considering the announcement was made on X and there's no link to it on the website.

Meanwhile can anyone pull out the latest Ethereum Foundation funding project list because it beats me why WiEN would go this way. Did the foundation find a replacement or are working on one because it makes no sense to discontinue support for something as widely appreciated as WiEN."

* Eth's **Pectra upgrade** will change the world. Navigate smart contracts on the blockchain without even knowing it's crypto! Allows users to browse or create smart contracts with no fees! Sign transactions with FaceID or fingerprint identification! (see Highlights in comments section)

* Layer2s will be approaching 1000tps in 2025. In the first half of 2025 we are going to increase target blobs to 6. And a bit later target block size to around 60M Gas per block. Effectively doubling throughput and approaching ~1000 tps (actual tps, no bullshit inflated tps). At that point ETH will be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure blockchain.

Seamless Cross-Chain Swaps Are Here: Arcana Wallet,deficryptos,1hre9q4,2025-01-01 17:24:08,6,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/deficryptos/comments/1hre9q4/seamless_crosschain_swaps_are_here_arcana_wallet/,Ancient-Ingenuity-90,,"

Imagine a world where moving assets across multiple blockchains is as easy as clicking a button. That world is no longer a dream; it‚Äôs a reality with Arcana Wallet. Powered by the revolutionary technology of Chain Abstraction, Arcana Wallet eliminates the complexity of cross-chain transactions and makes seamless swaps accessible to everyone.

In a recent live demonstration, the power of Arcana Wallet‚Äôs capabilities was on full display. The wallet effortlessly swapped USDT (Tether) to ETH (Ether) on the Arbitrum network without requiring the user to have USDT on that specific chain. The process was nothing short of groundbreaking. Here‚Äôs what happened:

1. **Sourcing Liquidity from Optimism**: The wallet identified available liquidity on the Optimism network. This step is critical, as finding liquidity across different chains has traditionally been a cumbersome process requiring manual intervention and significant technical know-how.
2. **Transferring Assets to Arbitrum**: Once the liquidity was sourced, the wallet seamlessly transferred the required funds to Arbitrum. This step often involves multiple intermediary transactions and bridging fees when done manually, but Arcana Wallet managed it with zero input from the user.
3. **Completing the Swap in One Click**: Finally, the wallet executed the swap, converting the USDT into ETH on Arbitrum. The entire process, which would typically require navigating multiple platforms, coordinating across chains, and incurring high fees, was completed in a single, user-friendly click.

This demonstration wasn‚Äôt just a technical showcase‚Äîit was a revelation. For the first time, users could see what‚Äôs possible when advanced blockchain technology prioritizes simplicity and user experience.

# Why Chain Abstraction Matters

The foundation of Arcana Wallet‚Äôs power lies in its use of Chain Abstraction. But what exactly is Chain Abstraction? At its core, it is the decoupling of blockchain complexities from the end-user experience. In simpler terms, users don‚Äôt need to worry about what chain they‚Äôre operating on, what assets they hold, or how to bridge liquidity. The wallet handles all of that seamlessly in the background.

This technology is a game-changer for both new and experienced crypto users. For newcomers, it removes the intimidating barriers of understanding blockchain interoperability. For seasoned traders, it saves time, reduces costs, and opens up new possibilities for efficient trading strategies.

# A New Era of Cross-Chain Trading

The introduction of Arcana Wallet marks a new era in cross-chain trading. Traditional methods often involve juggling multiple wallets, using bridges that require significant manual input, and paying exorbitant fees‚Äînot to mention the constant risk of errors during transfers. Arcana Wallet eliminates these pain points entirely.

Moreover, the wallet‚Äôs intuitive design and user-friendly interface mean that anyone, regardless of technical expertise, can start trading across chains with ease. The focus shifts from the logistical challenges of blockchain transactions to what truly matters: making informed and profitable trades.

# Try Arcana Wallet Today

The days of complicated multi-chain transactions are over. With Arcana Wallet, powered by Chain Abstraction, you can experience the future of crypto trading today. Simplify your cross-chain swaps, save time, and focus on what matters most.

Don‚Äôt just take our word for it. Try it out yourself and see the difference. Visit [arcana.network/wallet](https://arcana.network/wallet) and join the revolution in blockchain technology.

"Could Kendu Inu Be the Next Shib?
",shitcoinmoonshots,1hqva0c,2024-12-31 23:06:38,116,0.95,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/shitcoinmoonshots/comments/1hqva0c/could_kendu_inu_be_the_next_shib/,soFinished,ERC-20 Token,"You probably are doubting me pretty heavily right now, but hear me out and and let me prove to you that Kendu Inu might actually be the next Shiba.

Firstly, the parallels we have with Shib are literally unmatched. We have many shib ogs in the community, these include regular community members and the Dev himself is a very early shib member, which can be proven with his relations to Shytoshi, who has came in our telegram, published us on their magazine, Shytoshi follows us on our twitter page and is in contact with our Dev, Miazaki.

Our holder count is also constantly increasing which is fairly bullish. Redistribution has heavily increased and many new Chad's are getting a bigger stake in the game - that could be you btw - and vibes in the tg have been absolutely immaculate. Our holder count the last couple weeks has also gone completely parabolic (note it's harder to get new holders in eth coins when compared to sol coins, just compare any big eth and sol coin).

Now, to my main point why this is the next shib gain opportunity. The Chad's in the telegram work day in day out where even new Chad's come in the tg and immediately adapt to the culture. These are some battle hardened soldiers in the tg, these people have been dragged through the dirt in regards to the chart, yet their attitude doesn't waver and neither does their work. Kendu is truly inevitable, the workers are relentless and show NO signs of stopping anytime soon. They've devoted their lives and energy to taking us all the way. This is incredibly similar to the early Shib days. Those people knew exactly what they were going and didn't lose hope when shib dropped by 99%. This is pretty much replicated in Kendu Inu with 100% accuracy. Everyone in the tg knows exactly where we're going and won't stop until we reach it. The work is completely relentless. The Kendu army will not take no as an answer and absolutely will never accept defeat. Miazaki has drilled this into our heads and we simply put out helmets on and will continue this grind until our work's complete. It is what it is.

Futhermore, let me introduce you to the parallels Miazaki has with the mysterious Shiba Inu developer, Ryoshi.

[Ryoshi](https://preview.redd.it/e8ude1qz3bae1.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=352f0b3b33a3d60cf96b3be475606020fe8c85a1)

Miazaki picks up where Ryoshi left off. He openly acknowledges the disgraces of DeFi and how it can never succeed. We‚Äôve seen time and time again if people were given the chance, they would screw over each other in an instant. Ryoshi‚Äôs utopia of decentralisation could never come true given the greed of human nature. $KENDU is creating a similar utopia for those currently stuck in the slums of DeFi.

At KENDU we are restoring DeFi what it was originally meant to be, a way to escape the power and control governments have on us. And how will this be accomplished?

Many will doubt this process, but Miazaki has from the beginning revealed his voice alone and recently his face as well. That is more than what Ryoshi ever did, and even Shytoshi has done. Yes, a lot of developers use their real voice to communicate with their communities, but remember the ties that Miazaki has. This is no mere doxx, it doesn't take a genius to understand how.

I‚Äôve already told you that Miazaki is picking up where Ryoshi left off, but in revealing his identity, we can see $KENDU is not destined for the same fate as Shiba Inu is in right now. Miazaki will not leave like Ryoshi left. He will lead us out of these DeFi sewers and create a decentralised community with a real leader (as contradictive as it sounds, this is the only way to restore DeFi, I don't want to mention how Shiba Inu failed after their leader failed again), as well as many notable figures in the community.

He has also recently revealed we will be bridging to Solana, in order to onboard more holders to the Kendu army. We truly are inevitable, even across chains.

The coming utopia will NOT be ignored. Join us at Kendu now or forever bow your head. This utopia will last for years to come, and shape a better future for DeFi. If you look at the chart and feel discouraged, altseason hasn't really started and heaps of top memecoins are down pretty bad right now. When btc hits crazy heights do you really think coins like kendu will stay as low as it is right now?

Help Needed: Issues Unstaking Pooled ETH via Kiln ‚Äì Multiple Pending Transactions,ledgerwallet,1hppbh9,2024-12-30 10:14:47,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/1hppbh9/help_needed_issues_unstaking_pooled_eth_via_kiln/,WreckedElf,Solved (user),"EDIT: SORTED What a nightmare this was...

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm experiencing a frustrating issue while trying to unstake my Pooled ETH via Kiln, and I‚Äôm hoping someone here can help.

When I attempted to send a request to ask to withdraw my Pooled ETH, I needed to pay a gas fee. I modified the gas fee and sent the transaction, but the screen kept showing an error message, making me think the transaction wasn‚Äôt accepted.

After several attempts, I checked my transactions and noticed that multiple transactions are now pending‚Äîclearly, the errors misled me into thinking the requests hadn‚Äôt gone through.

Now I have a screen offering me the option to ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpeed Up‚Äù each pending transaction, but the gas fees are showing as up to $25 per transaction! I‚Äôve also learned that I need to clear these pending transactions (cancel or speed them up) just to process the unstaking request, let alone withdraw the funds.

I have a few questions I hope you can help with:

1. Which transaction should I cancel or speed up first?
2. Do I need to pay gas fees for every single pending transaction?
3. Is there a way to resolve this without spending an unreasonable amount on gas fees?

I‚Äôm not even transferring funds at this point, just trying to complete the unstaking process. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

P.S. people started messaging me in DMs and I followed one person's advice to clear my wallet cache. I feel like this was a mistake as the transactions are no longer in my ""latest operations"". Which means I can no longer speed up or cancel the transaction in Ledger. Thankfully I saved all the links in blockchain explorer EtherScan and for the wallet. Would really appreciate any advice how to get through this.

Analysts Divided on Ether‚Äôs Potential Q1 2025 Rally,cryptoddler,1hphfdt,2024-12-30 01:54:31,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1hphfdt/analysts_divided_on_ethers_potential_q1_2025_rally/,Actual_Ad_5440,,"Ether (**ETH**) could lead a Q1 rally in 2025, according to historical trends and growing optimism around spot Ether ETFs. However, macroeconomic uncertainty continues to divide analysts on whether ETH can outperform in the coming year.

# Historical Trends and ETF Inflows

* Ether has historically posted strong returns in the first quarters following a **U.S. presidential election** and **Bitcoin halving cycles**:
   * **Q1 2017**: +518%
   * **Q1 2021**: +161%
* Spot Ether ETFs have seen **$2.5 billion in net inflows** over the last 24 trading days, with predictions of **$50 billion in inflows** in 2025 under anticipated crypto-friendly regulations from the Trump administration.

# Bullish Predictions

CK Zheng, CIO of ZX Squared Capital, believes Ether ETFs and favorable U.S. policies could drive significant market momentum:

>

# Bearish Concerns

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, offered a more cautious outlook:

* A **hawkish macro climate**, marked by reduced liquidity and higher-than-expected interest rates, could limit Ether‚Äôs performance.
* He does not expect ETH to hit a new all-time high in 2025.

# Macroeconomic Headwinds

* The **crypto market cap** has fallen 12.1% to $3.41 trillion after the Federal Reserve revised its 2025 interest rate projections.
* The Federal Funds Rate could now peak at **3.9%** instead of 3.4%, creating a less favorable environment for risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ether.

# Conclusion

While Ether‚Äôs strong historical performance and ETF inflows suggest potential for a Q1 rally, macroeconomic factors like interest rates and liquidity remain critical. With Ether currently priced at **$3,997**, 2025 may bring significant volatility, leaving investors to navigate mixed predictions about the asset‚Äôs trajectory."

The administration may push for the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** to oversee crypto, classifying assets like ETH as commodities. This shift would benefit Ethereum, as the CFTC is seen as a more lenient regulator. Additionally, the decline of ‚Äúfinancial nihilism,‚Äù characterized by speculative memecoins, could redirect focus toward Ethereum's strong fundamentals and real-world utility.

# ETH Staking Yields in ETFs

With potential changes to SEC policy, Ether ETFs offering staking yields (currently 3.1%) could gain approval. Such products would attract institutional investors, especially in a declining interest rate environment, driving demand for ETH and improving its economics.

# Trump‚Äôs Endorsement of Ethereum

Trump‚Äôs family-backed project, **World Liberty Financial**, built on Ethereum, further signals support for the ecosystem. By championing ETH‚Äôs programmability and DeFi capabilities, the administration could accelerate its adoption and bolster its market position."

Why I am bullish on ETH 2025 analysis!,CryptoCurrency,1hmwmyo,2024-12-26 15:02:43,214,0.83,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hmwmyo/why_i_am_bullish_on_eth_2025_analysis/,bzzking,ANALYSIS,"I am bullish on Ether 2025! Screw all those re-posted clickbait articles üòÇ

First, lets take a look at the latest Ethereum DENCUN upgrade which was a huge success! Dencun upgrade was released in March of 2024. Let's look at the key features of the upgrade:

* **Verkle Trees**: Introduced to reduce the amount of data validators need to store, improving network efficiency.
* **Optimistic Rollups**: Enhanced Layer 2 scaling solutions for better transaction throughput.
* **Proposer/Builder Separation (PBS)**: Aimed at improving the security and decentralization of the network.
* **Stateless Clients**: Enabled nodes to operate without needing to store the entire blockchain state, making it easier for users to run nodes.

Dencun had a HUGE impact on scalability, security, and decentralization! Both performance and user experience was improved and it set the foundations for the upcoming Pectra upgrade (more on the later).

Moreover, Dencun introduced Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) which significantly reduced transaction fees for Layer 2 solutions. Rollup providers like Arbitrum and Optimism have reported a noticeable decrease in fees, making transactions more affordable for users! Also, ephemeral data blobs had a huge impact which allow rollup providers to store data more cost-effectively. This has reduced the burden on network nodes and optimized overall performance. The upgrade has enhanced Ethereum's scalability by allowing Layer 2 solutions to handle more transactions off-chain. This has led to a smoother user experience and increased capacity for handling more users. The upgrade has maintained the security and decentralization of the network. Node operators and stakers have successfully upgraded their software to support the new changes, ensuring a stable and secure network.

Dencun upgrade has been a success, addressing key issues such as scalability, transaction fees, and network efficiency.

Now, Dencun was released Q1 2024, but what can we expect for 2025 and why be bullish? Well, let's talk about the next Pectra upgrade! Unfortunately, we don't have a release date yet, but it is expected ""early 2025"" which I'm hoping is Q1 2025 based on historical upgrades!

Pectra upgrade key features:

* **Account Abstraction**: Allows users to batch transactions and pay fees in any ERC-20 token.
* **Blob Expansion**: Enhances data availability capacity and reduces fees for Layer 2 networks.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proof Upgrade**: Improves privacy and scalability.
* **Staking Upgrade**: Increases the maximum balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.

Pectra upgrade will focus on scalability, security, and user experience which is always a major interest for everyone involved in Ethereum improvements!
