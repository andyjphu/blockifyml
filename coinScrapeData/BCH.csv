Bitcoin Cash and Monero development complexity?,btc,1i9wwy6,2025-01-25 16:00:20,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1i9wwy6/bitcoin_cash_and_monero_development_complexity/,MichaelTen,,"For Bitcoin Cash in relation to Monero, is Bitcoin Cash less complicated for microtransactions in some ways, or are they both about equally complex to use in development when comparing Monero and Bitcoin Cash?

My one week review,ZBD,1i9wwcj,2025-01-25 15:59:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZBD/comments/1i9wwcj/my_one_week_review/,Commercial_Swan1747,,"Unbiased, unpaid, real human review: 4.3/5. 
 I was skeptical to download given some 1 star reviews & things said on reddit.

Positives: 
+Currently working part time from Holiday season so I had free time. Week without a referral I made $15.88 BTC cashed out >Coinbase & then Crypto.com. I targeted when BTC was at a low using Trading View candle charts. 
+Easy cash out, lots of ways to earn.
+ZBD official games are great for earning daily payouts. Specifically Bitcoin Miner, Idle Miner.
     ×  (I tend to use idle miner the most as when I'm busy I can leave it on in my pocket to get me to the amount I need to progress)

Negatives:
 -Surveys tend to say inaccurate data even when given exact real info. -Playtime stopped paying goals after new member bonus.
-Playtime rewards stop paying out with some games (Coin Master in my case stopped recording time played and never registered my 60 minute session even after 48 hours had passed).
     -thus I recommend getting your rewards early        on ans moving on to a new game when possible to maximize your new member bonus.
-I cannot speak on all games but even though my region is a daily 350 payout, after two days of payout of 350 on idle miner, the next day it was lowered to 320. I may be lacking information as a new user but keep this in mind and do your research. Maybe someone here knows why.
-Some games like BTC cards and GPU miner are intrusive with ads to an unnecessary amount and use tactics to time the ads as you're tapping so that you accidentally open that ad. Those apps also tend to be basic in format but lack optization and can be difficult to use as it tends to be unresponsive sometimes. 

USE REFERALS. You both get 20% of what both of you gain from activities. If you can, get a referral from someone here on reddit (DO NOT POST YOUR CODES HERE IN THE OFFICIAL SUBREDDIT. READ THE RULES) and refer other people to join so you all make money. Making the referral a must for passive income. 


Overall. This is a must have application especially if you want to take advantage of the current bull market rush of 2025. 

Additionally, users who have been using this app for awhile, please share any suggestions or tactics that may help me more.
I'd also like to hear from people who invest real money to know if it's worth it.
Happy grinding everyone. Love it here. "
Is Wild Casino Legit in 2025? My Detailed Thoughts on Its Reliability,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wl1i,2025-01-25 15:46:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wl1i/is_wild_casino_legit_in_2025_my_detailed_thoughts/,funucker26,,"In the realm of online gaming, Wild Casino is a well-known brand whose legitimacy in 2025 is much questioned. Having some time browsing the platform, I have discovered both positive and negative aspects on its dependability and general user interface. What you search for in an online casino will determine whether it is suitable for you.

Wild Casino's simple layout and large game library caught my attention first. It appeals to gamers with diverse tastes since it provides live dealer choices, table games, and several slots. Since respectable software developers provide the games, one has some faith that the results are equitable. For both casual and serious players, the choices are more than sufficient even if they are not as extensive as on some bigger platforms.

Regarding security, Wild Casino seems to act to keep its patrons safe. It is licensed, which gives its activities credibility; it uses encryption to protect transactions and personal data. As with any online casino, though, it's always advisable to investigate licensing and rules yourself since these differ depending on your jurisdiction.

With support for several payment options, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which might offer quicker transactions, deposits and withdrawals are simple. From what I know, payouts were handled within a reasonable period and deposits were fast. Having said that, some players have complained of delays with bigger withdrawals; so, it is advisable to bear this in mind should you intend to cash out huge sums.

Especially for new players, Wild Casino offers significant bonuses and promotions. Like most casinos, the welcome bonus is enticing, but it comes with wagering criteria you must satisfy before withdrawing any earnings. Although this is common in the business, if you are not aware with how bonus terms operate, you should give some thought.

2025 Wild Casino experience: what is yours? Have you run across any problems with the platform, or do you find it fair and reliable? Your opinions on its games, payments, and general dependability would be much valued. Opinions can enable people make decisions on whether Wild Casino is the best option for their online gaming requirements."
My Honest Take on PlayAmo Casino in 2025: Is It Reliable?,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wjgn,2025-01-25 15:44:02,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wjgn/my_honest_take_on_playamo_casino_in_2025_is_it/,funucker26,,"PlayAmo Casino has become increasingly popular, especially among players who value a wide range of games and quick payouts. In 2025, it continues to attract attention with its easy-to-use interface and appeal to both casual players and high rollers. However, whether it’s the right platform for you depends on factors like game variety, payment methods, and customer support.

One of its biggest strengths is its extensive game library. PlayAmo offers a large selection of slots, table games, and live dealer options from top providers. The slot games range from simple, classic styles to more advanced and interactive ones. The live dealer games are also high-quality, delivering an engaging experience. That said, some players might find the table game options somewhat limited compared to other platforms that focus more on traditional casino games.

PlayAmo also stands out for its diverse payment options, including credit cards, e-wallets, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Crypto payments are particularly appealing for players seeking privacy and fast transactions. While withdrawals are usually processed quickly, larger payouts might take longer, so keep this in mind if you plan to cash out significant amounts.

The casino offers attractive bonuses and promotions, such as welcome packages and free spins. These can be valuable, especially for new players, but they come with wagering requirements. It’s important to read the terms to understand what’s needed to withdraw bonus winnings. While the bonuses are generous, the wagering requirements might not suit everyone.

Customer support is available via live chat, and most players find the team responsive and helpful. However, during busy times, there may be slight delays in getting assistance. Despite this, PlayAmo generally has a good reputation for resolving issues efficiently.

Have you tried PlayAmo Casino? How was your experience with their games, payouts, or customer service? Sharing your thoughts could help others decide if this platform is the right fit for them in 2025."
Bovada Casino in 2025: Is It a Good Choice for US Players?,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wj8f,2025-01-25 15:43:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wj8f/bovada_casino_in_2025_is_it_a_good_choice_for_us/,funucker26,,"Bovada Casino has been a go-to choice for online gambling in the US for years, and it’s still pretty popular in 2025. It’s known for offering a mix of casino games, sports betting, and poker all under one account, which is super convenient. While it has a lot going for it, there are definitely a few things to think about before deciding if it’s the right fit for you.

One of the things I like about Bovada is the variety of games. You’ve got slots, classic table games like blackjack and roulette, and even live dealer options if you want more of a real casino vibe. Plus, the sportsbook and poker room are right there, so it’s easy to switch between different types of gambling. That said, the selection isn’t as huge as what you’ll find on some bigger international sites, so if you’re into niche games, you might feel a bit limited.

Another thing Bovada gets right is the deposit and withdrawal options. You can use credit cards, bank transfers, or cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is especially great because it’s faster and has fewer fees. For the most part, withdrawals are pretty quick, but I’ve heard some people mention delays depending on the method they used. If you’re planning to cash out, it’s probably a good idea to plan ahead just in case.

The bonuses and promotions are another highlight. New players get solid welcome offers, and there are regular deals for existing users too. But like most casinos, the bonuses come with wagering requirements, which can make it tricky to withdraw winnings right away. If you’re someone who doesn’t like restrictions, you might want to skip the bonuses or at least read the terms carefully before claiming them.

As for security, Bovada has been around for a long time and is licensed, which gives it some credibility. The platform is encrypted to keep your info safe, and it has a decent reputation for fair play. That said, it operates in a bit of a gray area when it comes to US gambling laws, so it’s worth knowing the risks. If you’re looking for a reliable option that’s focused on US players, Bovada is a strong contender, but it might not be ideal if you want a fully regulated platform.

Have you used Bovada in 2025? Do you think it’s still one of the top options for US players, or have you found better alternatives? I’d love to hear about your experiences and how they compare to what you expected. Sharing your thoughts could really help others decide if Bovada is the right choice for them."

The dividend payout ratio remains modest at 10.61%, indicating that the company retains ample resources for future investments.

Despite some insider selling, including notable transactions from CAO Amie Thuener O’toole and Director Frances Arnold, Alphabet remains an attractive stock for institutional investors. Analysts have set a price target of $205.13, signaling continued optimism about the company’s future prospects.

Alphabet Inc. continues to show strong [financial results](https://worldmagzine.com/fashion/resilience-in-fashion-q3-2024-financial-performance-highlights/) and institutional backing, making it an appealing investment for the future."

They are currently offering €10.00 when you use a SEPA bank transfer buy €100 in Bitcoin. (I recommend buying €101 to be sure).

Any bank account in Euros you have will be able to send a SEPA transfer for free. If you do not have one I recommend using TransferWise, Bitwala, Revolut, Starling, Monese etc

The Kriptomat charges are on the high side for exchanges. You will be charged:

* €1.45 when you purchase €100 of crypto.
* €7 (0.0006 BTC) when you send your Bitcoin to another wallet

However, there is a way to get round the high fees. You can exchange your Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash and then send that instead. Crypto to Crypto exchanges are free, and send amounts are only €0.03

This would mean your **total profit is €8.52**, and if you refer any friends you will get an additional €10.00 for every one that signs up and also buts €100 of Bitcoin.

Lots of FreeBitcoiners have taken advantage of this offer. It is a great offer to do if you have not done so already.

Selling bitcoin and transferring into tax sheltered accounts,BitcoinCA,1i9g7sw,2025-01-25 00:39:17,9,0.74,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/1i9g7sw/selling_bitcoin_and_transferring_into_tax/,Rumpleforeskin2018,,"Hi Everyone. 

I’d love to hear about any experiences or guidance on this. 

Has anyone thought about selling BTC in cold storage and moving the cash into RRSPs and TFSAs to purchase crypto ETFs?

BTC profits as I understand it are subject to capital gains tax. If someone held more than half but less than a full bitcoin in cold storage and made between 120-160 k a year on top of that, but the move still be lucrative?

I’m guessing that we will see more crypto ETFs in the very near future, and despite a bit of a tax hit (assuming say 60-70 k in contribution room in both RRSP and TFSA), would it be a worthy move?


Thanks for any thoughts. "

# Tesla Debuts New Model Y in US, Europe in Bid to Revive Sales

Tesla is hitting the reset button on its best-selling Model Y, debuting a revamped version in the U.S. and Europe with hopes of reversing its first annual sales drop in over a decade. The refresh brings updates like Cybertruck-inspired light bars, soundproofed interiors, and a range of 320 miles. But at $59,990, it's a premium gamble—one that Elon Musk seems confident will pay off, even in a turbulent EV market.

**What’s New Under the Hood?**  
  
The ""Juniper"" Model Y comes with fresh aesthetics, tech upgrades like rear-seat touchscreens, and faster Wi-Fi, but it’s not just a facelift. The refreshed SUV now touts a zippier 0-60 mph time of 4.1 seconds, giving it a slight edge in performance. While the base model remains, the “Launch Series” version—packed with features like Full Self-Driving—is Tesla’s bold bet to woo customers willing to shell out extra for cutting-edge convenience.

**A Pricey Predicament**  
  
The updated price tag, roughly $4,000 more than its predecessor, might be a tough sell. With EV demand cooling and higher interest rates pinching consumer wallets, Tesla’s bet on premium features will test whether its loyal fanbase will dig deeper into their pockets. Add in the looming repeal of federal EV tax credits under Trump’s new administration, and the stakes for the Model Y refresh couldn’t be higher.  
  
Tesla’s upcoming earnings report will reveal whether this redesign can jumpstart sales. Investors will also be on the lookout for updates on the long-rumored “Model 2,” Tesla’s anticipated budget-friendly EV. With Musk targeting sales growth of 20–30% in 2025, all roads seem to lead to more affordable options for expanding the EV giant's reach.

**The Bigger Picture:** Tesla’s refresh is as much about optics as it is about specs. The EV pioneer faces mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers and traditional automakers leaning into the EV space. Whether the new Model Y can fend off rivals and keep Tesla’s dominance alive will hinge on its ability to balance innovation with affordability—a feat easier said than done.

For now, the Model Y refresh signals that Tesla isn’t just coasting; it’s steering into the future, albeit at a premium price.

# Meta's $65 Billion AI Bet: Zuckerberg Goes All-In

Mark Zuckerberg is putting Meta’s chips—actually, 1.3 million GPUs worth—on artificial intelligence, with plans to invest up to $65 billion in 2025. This spending spree includes a Manhattan-sized data center, a hiring boost for AI teams, and enough computing power to make the sci-fi nerds blush. The tech giant isn’t just flexing; it’s making a play to dominate the next era of innovation.

**A Data Center the Size of Ambition**  
  
Meta’s new Louisiana data center is so massive it could ""cover a significant part of Manhattan,"" according to Zuckerberg. With a gigawatt of computing power set to come online next year, Meta is preparing to turbocharge its AI capabilities. The timing aligns with a broader arms race among tech titans, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet also throwing billions at AI infrastructure.

**Can AI Investments Keep Investors Happy?**  
  
While Wall Street had expected Meta to spend around $51 billion on capex in 2025, the additional $14 billion caught some off guard. Yet, analysts see the move as bold but potentially brilliant, arguing it positions Meta to lead in AI innovation. Shares initially dipped but recovered, with the stock closing at an all-time high of $647.49 on Friday.

**The Bigger Picture**  
  
Zuckerberg isn’t shy about the risks. He’s acknowledged the possibility of overbuilding but believes missing out on AI would be a bigger blunder. ""The downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for the next 10–15 years,"" he said. With a track record of making high-stakes bets that pay off (hello, Instagram acquisition), the gamble could redefine how Meta operates—and how we interact with technology.

**What’s Next?** As Meta gears up for its Q4 earnings on Jan. 29, investors will be looking for more details on these grandiose AI plans. If Zuckerberg’s bets pay off, Meta might not just own the metaverse—it could be the backbone of tomorrow’s AI-driven economy.

# Meta's $65 Billion AI Bet: Zuckerberg Goes All-In

Mark Zuckerberg is putting Meta’s chips—actually, 1.3 million GPUs worth—on artificial intelligence, with plans to invest up to $65 billion in 2025. This spending spree includes a Manhattan-sized data center, a hiring boost for AI teams, and enough computing power to make the sci-fi nerds blush. The tech giant isn’t just flexing; it’s making a play to dominate the next era of innovation.

**A Data Center the Size of Ambition**  
  
Meta’s new Louisiana data center is so massive it could ""cover a significant part of Manhattan,"" according to Zuckerberg. With a gigawatt of computing power set to come online next year, Meta is preparing to turbocharge its AI capabilities. The timing aligns with a broader arms race among tech titans, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet also throwing billions at AI infrastructure.

**Can AI Investments Keep Investors Happy?**  
  
While Wall Street had expected Meta to spend around $51 billion on capex in 2025, the additional $14 billion caught some off guard. Yet, analysts see the move as bold but potentially brilliant, arguing it positions Meta to lead in AI innovation. Shares initially dipped but recovered, with the stock closing at an all-time high of $647.49 on Friday.

**The Bigger Picture**  
  
Zuckerberg isn’t shy about the risks. He’s acknowledged the possibility of overbuilding but believes missing out on AI would be a bigger blunder. ""The downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for the next 10–15 years,"" he said. With a track record of making high-stakes bets that pay off (hello, Instagram acquisition), the gamble could redefine how Meta operates—and how we interact with technology.

**What’s Next?** As Meta gears up for its Q4 earnings on Jan. 29, investors will be looking for more details on these grandiose AI plans. If Zuckerberg’s bets pay off, Meta might not just own the metaverse—it could be the backbone of tomorrow’s AI-driven economy.

👜 The Ultimate Guide: Why Replica Sellers Are Turning to Crypto Payments in 2024 🔒💳,HighRiskPaymentPro,1i9c1v5,2025-01-24 20:44:08,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighRiskPaymentPro/comments/1i9c1v5/the_ultimate_guide_why_replica_sellers_are/,repg0ddotcom,Replica ,"Running a replica business? In 2024, crypto payments are becoming the go-to solution for sellers in high-risk industries like yours. 

Why? Because traditional payment gateways just can’t keep up.

The Problem with Traditional Payment Processors

❌ High fees that eat into your profits.

❌ Constant risk of account bans and frozen funds.

❌ Long payout times that disrupt cash flow.

❌ Chargebacks that drain your revenue.

For replica sellers, these hurdles make running a smooth business nearly impossible.

Why Crypto Payments Are the Best Solution for Replica Sellers

1️⃣ Instant Transactions
Say goodbye to waiting days (or weeks) to access your earnings. Crypto payments are processed instantly, giving you immediate control over your funds.




2️⃣ No Chargebacks
Chargebacks are a nightmare for replica sellers, but crypto eliminates this issue entirely. Transactions are irreversible, protecting your revenue from disputes.


3️⃣ Privacy and Security
Crypto payments are discreet. You can accept payments securely without worrying about exposure to financial institutions that blacklist replica sellers.


4️⃣ Global Accessibility
Whether your customers are in Europe, Asia, or the U.S., crypto allows you to accept payments from anywhere in the world—no restrictions.


How to Get Started with Crypto Payments for Your Replica Business

	1.	Choose a reliable fiat-to-crypto payment gateway. Look for one with:

	•	Instant payouts in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDC 💸

	•	Low transaction fees 🔑

	•	No lengthy verification processes 🔒

    2.	Integrate the gateway into your website to provide customers with a seamless checkout experience.

	3.	Educate your customers. Many buyers are new to crypto, so offering tutorials or guides on using crypto wallets can improve conversions.

Final Thoughts

In the replica industry, staying ahead means adapting to smarter payment solutions. Crypto payments solve the biggest challenges replica sellers face, allowing you to focus on growing your business.

BlackRock files for ETF rule change to enable in-kind Bitcoin redemptions,Blockmandev,1i9by7t,2025-01-24 20:38:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i9by7t/blackrock_files_for_etf_rule_change_to_enable/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Nasdaq revolutionizes Bitcoin ETF game with in-kind redemptions  

Nasdaq takes a bold leap, filing an updated rule proposal to allow in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF ($IBIT). This change means investors could soon receive their $BTC directly during redemptions, sidestepping the need to convert holdings into cash.  

The new mechanism simplifies operations, trims tax implications, and caters to institutional players demanding greater efficiency. Previously, issuers like BlackRock had to liquidate $BTC and return cash, leading to extra layers of complexity and potential tax hits.  

If given the green light, this represents a win for crypto ETFs. Adding the option for in-kind processes could push issuers to embrace this model broadly, bridging digital assets with traditional finance more seamlessly.  

Is this the evolution Bitcoin ETFs needed to bring more power to investors? We'll find out soon enough. Stay tuned for regulatory updates.

ECB Pushes for Digital Euro in Response to Trump’s Stablecoin Push,draqai,1i9bn2g,2025-01-24 20:23:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9bn2g/ecb_pushes_for_digital_euro_in_response_to_trumps/,MammothBattle33,,"👀 Big moves in the crypto world, babes!  

Donald Trump’s got everyone talking with his explosive new executive order promoting dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide. He’s all about turning up the crypto game and keeping things spicy, making waves while blocking the Federal Reserve from rolling out its own CBDC. And don’t get it twisted—his focus is on growing legit, lawful crypto vibes.  

But hold up, Europe isn’t letting this slide. The ECB is like, Oh no, you didn’t. They're pushing hard to get their own digital euro in the mix to counter Trump’s stablecoin flex. ECB board member Piero Cipollone says this trend of stablecoins could mess up traditional banks by snatching their customers and their cash flow. Yikes.  

The drama? A digital euro could lead to cash flowing out of banks and into ECB-backed wallets. While the ECB's still figuring stuff out, a final verdict depends on European lawmakers playing ball.  

Meanwhile, the Trump train keeps rolling. His executive order is all about setting up a national digital asset stockpile and hyping up crypto-bank partnerships, making it even easier for banks and crypto platforms to team up. Someone pass me some popcorn; this showdown is getting juicy!  

Do you think Trump just leveled up the crypto game, or will Europe manage to hold the line with the digital euro? Sound off, my crypto fam!

Mom in a 10 year relationship with an “FBI agent”,CryptoRomanceScams,1i9b4u4,2025-01-24 19:58:38,3,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoRomanceScams/comments/1i9b4u4/mom_in_a_10_year_relationship_with_an_fbi_agent/,Onthehunt4Kevin,Informational post,"I wanted to know if there is anyone else out there who has heard of this scenario because I can’t find anything online about this.

My mom has been in a relationship with a man who claims to be an FBI agent who has been stuck overseas for various reasons such as blaming the first Trump administration to saying he’s been in and out of the hospital for high blood pressure. Of course no matter what the situation is there is always a reason to ask for financial assistance to pay for a phone, a laptop needed for a new job, or to help pay off the hospital’s. His newest scam is paying some random person or the doctor from the hospital so that he can have access to a phone to talk to her.

How do I know he’s fake? I’ve heard him talk to her on the phone and he sounds like he’s from Nigeria, never FaceTimes her, has a Gmail account rather than an official FBI email account, and all of the pictures he sends are poor quality (one of which was an FBI badge that looks photoshopped). I have also made the mistake of messaging him myself to tell him to leave my mom alone and you can tell his English is horrible. He then continued to threaten me and even told me he knows he can get away with this. After I confronted my mom with this information she took his side and told me that I said a lot of mean things to him. At this point I gave up. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that this is an addiction for my mom and that she may have invested too much at this point to give up. This man has had access to every bank account she’s ever had and even stole over $100,000 from one of the accounts she had using withdrawals through a CashApp account she gave him access too. He then converted all this money to Bitcoin. 

I’m now sharing this information in hopes that it may help someone else at this point or if someone has anymore information they can share. I have tried everything and even the people closest to her have given her proof that this person is fake. He’s just really good at talking his way out of everything including why his accent sounds so bad. She is a very stubborn and prideful so I have hesitated reporting this to any investigators or catfish shows for personal reasons that affect others involved in this situation. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. "

i'm using kryptex as it seems like the main safe miner but do all miners work like this? i thought that you'd mine bitcoin directly into your wallet, but this is mining cash to convert into bitcoin/other currencies, is there anything that mines bitcoin directly into your wallet so your bitcoin price scales with your profit?"
Investing in Factors,JustBuyFEQT,1i97eq6,2025-01-24 17:06:52,6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustBuyFEQT/comments/1i97eq6/investing_in_factors/,mytranslator_pro,Analysis,"A factor is a measurable characteristic of a group of securities or stocks that, over time, exhibit certain risk and return features. Building factor-based investment strategies involves screening companies based on well-known characteristics that help explain a security’s risk and return behaviours. Investors can incorporate exchange traded funds (ETFs) to help meet certain objectives over the long term.

You can choose to do it yourself, or you can rely on investment companies that offer ETFs based on those factors. 

In Canada (CAD currency), FIDELITY has a complete suite of factor ETFs that allow you to:

✅ pick specific factors for specific regions,

✅ pick ALL the factors of a specific region, or

✅ pick ALL the factors of ALL the regions!

So you have the choice! 
Fidelity describes those factors ETF to be active in design, and passive in execution. They seek to outperform a broad-market index by tracking a custom-built factor-based index.

Let’s dive a little bit deeper on the factors available at Fidelity and the corresponding ETFs:

🟢 Momentum: finds securities with improving fundamentals that have recently outperformed and may continue to do so over the medium term.

➡️ $FCMO for the 🇺🇸

➡️ $FCCM for 🇨🇦

➡️ $FCIM for 🌍

🟢 Value: seeks lower-cost securities that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value.

➡️ $FCUV for the 🇺🇸

➡️ $FCCV for 🇨🇦

➡️ $FCIV for 🌍   

🟢 Quality: targets companies with stable profitability and cash flows, a lack of excessive leverage or better credit quality.

➡️ $FCUQ for the 🇺🇸

➡️ $FCCQ for 🇨🇦

➡️ $FCIQ for 🌍     

🟢 Low Volatility: targets securities with lower risk than the broader market, as well as stable earnings.

➡️ $FCUL for the 🇺🇸

➡️ $FCCL for 🇨🇦

➡️ $FCIL for 🌍       

Instead of picking individual factors for specific regions, you can also opt for ETFs that contains ALL 4 FACTORS ABOVE for each regions:

➡️ $FCAM for all factors in the 🇺🇸

➡️ $FCCA for all factors in 🇨🇦

➡️ $FCIN for all factors 🌍 

And if you want it all in a convenient ALL-IN-ONE ETF, you can also choose $FEQT that contains ALL 4 factors for ALL regions (🇺🇸, 🇨🇦 and 🌍), with also the addition of Small Caps (2,5% weight through $FCGS) and Bitcoin (up to 10% weight, but normalized at 3% when it is rebalanced, through $FBTC).

Five reasons to consider factor investing for your portfolio:

➡️ Strategic exposure
Get strategic with your asset allocation. Investing in certain factors can help offset exposure to downside risk in other assets or help increase exposure to potential upside opportunities over the long term.

➡️ Cyclical exposure
Align your portfolio with current and future cyclical market cycles. Some factors may strengthen your portfolio during the early to mid-cycle phase, while others may help your portfolio benefit from late and recessionary stages in the cycle.

➡️ Portfolio construction
Craft your portfolio from the ground up using a combination of factors that align with your investment goals and risk profiles. Among options for low volatility or quality, your preferences are a key factor.

➡️ Enhanced returns
Improve long-term performance potential by targeting factors that have historically outperformed broad market indexes.

➡️ Risk management
Reduce concentration risk through an equal active overweight approach to portfolio construction.

These are great tools at our disposal, and I found them to be great complements to market-cap based ETFs such as $XEQT, $ZEQT, $VEQT, $HEQT, $XAW, to name a few. I have opted for a 50/50 approach in my portfolio between $FEQT and $XEQT to capture the best of both methodologies over the long term. The MER of FEQT is higher than other all-in-ones, due to its active design, but as long as the annual returns are delivered, it is not an issue (in 2024, FEQT total return was 7% higher than other all-in-ones such as XEQT).

DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,wallstreetbets,1i94vsy,2025-01-24 15:17:55,42,0.82,58,https://i.redd.it/5fgyrpck20fe1.jpeg,geneman7,DD,"I’m looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn’t agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren’t a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn’t agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It’s true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn’t go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I’m here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There’s a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath’s product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where’s their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath’s growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath’s potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I’m doing.

MicroStrategy Faces Billion-Dollar CAMT Tax Threat on Unrealized Bitcoin Gains,draqai,1i93ljv,2025-01-24 14:23:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i93ljv/microstrategy_faces_billiondollar_camt_tax_threat/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 MicroStrategy might be feeling the heat as the company faces a potential billion-dollar tax bill on its unrealized Bitcoin gains, courtesy of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. With a Bitcoin stash worth around $47 billion and $18 billion in unrealized gains, this could seriously shake things up for the corporate giant. The culprit? A new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) applied at a 15% rate on adjusted financial statement income. Ouch.

Unlike regular stock gains, the IRS hasn’t granted exemptions to crypto gains yet, leaving MicroStrategy lobbying harder than ever. If this doesn’t change, the company may have to part ways with its precious BTC holdings to cover the bill. Imagine selling your favorite item just to pay taxes. Yep, it's a vibe—but not a good one.

The issue isn’t just a MicroStrategy problem. With Coinbase joining the fight, crypto advocates are pushing hard for unrealized crypto gains to be excluded under CAMT guidelines. They argue that taxing gains you haven’t even cashed out yet equals unfair taxation on “what if” numbers. Can you sense the drama brewing? 🍿

Add to the pressure, regulatory headaches. The IRS’s new crypto tax rules rolling out in 2025 are already turning heads. Exchanges and brokers will need to step up their reporting game, making every crypto move we make even more trackable. Oh, and did you hear MicroStrategy recently settled a spicy $40 million tax fraud lawsuit? Drama, drama, drama.

This new chapter in crypto taxation could send shockwaves across BTC-loving industries everywhere, so stay tuned, because this story is far from over.

The extension is called **Slice** *(also called Addslice).* All it really does is add non-intrusive ads (hide-able) on a wide range of popular sites (YouTube, Google Search, etc.), and you, of course, get paid for every ad you see.

Slice pays you ""Slices"" for every ad you see. Slices are their in-app coins which you can withdraw via multiple methods:

* PayPal
* Bitcoin (ZEBEDEE)
* VISA

Now the good thing? *You can still block other ads while using Slice!*

Here's a small description from the Slice website itself:

I've really been enjoying Slice as it's making me quite a lot of free cash, and it's being updated almost weekly. I hope you guys will also enjoy it!

They recently just changed their referral program to include a new concept called crews. The way it works is if you sign up using a referral code you and the other person both earn a portion of each other's slices (10%). This way you generate even more passive income. I included my referral code down below if you wish to join my crew! However, it is completely your choice

This extension really has been one of my favourite ways to make the hours of schoolwork on my computer a little more fun!

"""Anonymous"" identification for the internet age - a question for the crypto community",btc,1i8znkl,2025-01-24 11:40:14,3,0.67,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1i8znkl/anonymous_identification_for_the_internet_age_a/,fergalius,,"I was just reading a [reddit dicussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1i88jxw/the_online_porn_freeforall_is_coming_to_an_end/) about age verification online and got to thinking about BCH/ETH and other smart contract platforms and tying in with Monero/Zcash style ZKPs (all of which, [it seems](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1i3jkre/on_shielded_address_for_bitcoin_cash_using/), will be coming to a cashtoken near you ... ""soon"" I hope).

Would it be possible to create a digital token for a person which could then be used as an ID everywhere BUT, in a provably anonymous way. i.e. the website or 3rd party service verifying the specific details about you would obtain no information - instead they would only obtain a ZKP response to the specific question they asked - for example, ""is the user >18yo?""

Such a token could be issued at birth and could be expanded to include much more than just a person's age (e.g. genetic data, health, financial, lifestyle...). But ALL the data would be provably securely encrypted and inaccessible even to the service provider asking questions about the data. Inaccessible even to the token issuer (presumably the govt)."

I am 36f and I am disabled with a condition causing severe pain. My condition is progressive. I am receiving a settlement soon in the amount of 200k. 

I recently got married (6 months ago) and my husband I think is starting to realize that my condition will likely get worse and he is concerned about being the sole bread winner for both of us. I think my condition was hard for him to understand and I look like a normal healthy person to the outsider. I am used to people not really grasping that I am not well until they are around me for awhile. 

I have social security disability but only receive 14,000 per year. I wanted to contribute more to the household so decided to start a business . I have made 50k in sales but I put around that much into the business so I have not profited much at all, but I hope that I will next year. Still , most businesses fail in 2-3 years. I tried to find something I could do from home with my condition.  Husband makes around 100k but we live in a HCOL area that he is tied to with his job until he receives his pension. So he has about 3k in savings. My expenses with medical care and food is about 10,000 per year. So I’m not really able to save up that much per year. Maybe 3,000 a year if that. Of course I will have expenses such as cars as I get older. I do have savings of 100k in ETFs in brokerage account I opened this year with my life savings. 

My husband needs a new car soon. He has 100k in a 401k and 100k in bitcoin that he is adamant about not touching, which I do understand as it will be taxed and he expects those investments to be worth more later on. His pension will be at 80% of his last 3 years of work. My husband has a house he has bought before me, my name is not on the deed. He has 100k in equity and 180k to pay off. 

 My husband has suggested that I use the money from my settlement to pay off the mortgage on his house , and said if he doesn’t have a mortgage that he will be able to save more to buy me a car etc. I am a little concerned of doing that as it is my first year of marriage and there is a very high rate of men leaving their wives in illness and my name is not on the deed, so I don’t know that I would have a place to live in case of divorce . I try to hope for the best but plan for the worse as I have a lot to lose. But I still want to find a balance of contributing to our household and taking off the burden for my husband as much as I can as well. He also needs a car and may ask me for help with paying for a car when he needs one, and I’m not really sure if I should be doing that just because I will have more liquid cash then him at this time. 

I think it’s best that I take the settlement and just add it to my brokerage account. Wanted to know what everyone else thinks I should do "

I want to let it sit there for at least 15-20 years. I also have 30k in silver bullion.

I am trying my best to prepare for my and our future , considering my health and my inability to hold down a normal job . I also decided to start a business this past year and have made 50k in sales but I put 40k into the business so I have not profited much, but I hope that I will next year. Still , most businesses fail in 2-3 years. I tried to find something I could do from home with my condition . I am anxious for the future. I am worried about looming medical bills, how I will afford cars, and trying to escape future poverty. I want to be able to not dip into my nest egg for my future . My husband has suggested that I use the money from my settlement to pay off the mortgage on his house , and said if he doesn’t have a mortgage that he will be able to save more to buy me a car etc. I am a little concerned of doing that as it is my first year of marriage and there is a very high rate of men leaving their wives in illness and my name is not on the deed, so I don’t know that I would have a place to live in case of divorce .

He also needs a car and may ask me for help with paying for a car when he needs one, and I’m not really sure if I should be doing that just because I will have more liquid cash then him at this time. 

I am wondering what my best decision to do with this 200k is. My thoughts are this: I should offer to help for a down payment for a car for my husband, I will then put the rest into my brokerage account and into ETFs. Because I am at a poverty tax rate , I believe I can take the money out at any time and not pay capital gains due to my income not being high enough (unless my business does become successful) . I believe because the interest rate will be higher than the interest of my husbands mortgage rate (3%) then it makes sense to invest the money into the stock market . I am also planning to sell the 30k in silver that I have as I don’t think silver will be the investment that some people think it will be . I will plan on investing that into the stock market as well and but keeping about 10k in a HYSA for emergencies . 

In 20 years due to compound interest I should have about 685,000 for my old age and I think that this is my best hope of having a somewhat normal life despite having a disability. The majority of people with disabilities live in extreme poverty. I wanted to get others opinions on if they think that this is the best route for me to take with my finances considering my situation. "

In a significant move, the SEC has launched a new crypto task force aimed at setting a sensible regulatory path for the cryptocurrency industry. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as ""crypto mom"" for her supportive stance on crypto innovation, this task force marks a shift from the previous enforcement-heavy approach to clearer regulation and guidance[3].

Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted at the possibility of delisting Tether's USDT if it fails to comply with upcoming U.S. regulations. The potential new rules could require stablecoin issuers to back their tokens entirely with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo periodic audits. Armstrong emphasized Coinbase's commitment to compliance and helping users transition to more secure assets[1][5].

In other news, President-elect Donald Trump has launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, which saw its market capitalization soar to several billion dollars shortly after its launch. Despite initial skepticism, the coin's popularity has been fueled by announcements on Trump's official social media channels. However, experts caution against the speculative nature of meme coins[2].

On the legislative front, the new administration is expected to work with Congress on stablecoin and market structure reforms, further defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in crypto regulations. A crypto council is also in the works to develop new regulatory policies, making 2025 a pivotal year for the crypto space[3].

In corporate news, Circle has acquired Hashnote for an undisclosed amount, and Solana's stablecoin supply has seen a 60% increase since Friday. Justin Sun has outlined a plan to push Ethereum to $10,000, and Jupiter is set to airdrop $630 million in JUP tokens. Bitcoin miners are enjoying tripled profit margins, and BTC mining has reportedly saved Texas $18 billion[3].

Riot Platforms is pivoting to AI data centers, and CLS Global has pleaded guilty to wash trading. CryptoCom has relaunched its US exchange, and KULR has bought another $8 million in BTC. Finland has launched its first-ever crypto ETPs, and the banking industry, led by BofA CEO, is ready to embrace crypto[3].

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, MicroStrategy shareholders have approved more BTC purchases, and Rex Shares has filed for ETFs related to $TRUMP, DOGE, and BONK. A Texas court has reversed sanctions on Tornado Cash, and there are plans to converge traditional finance and crypto, according to the Financial Times[3].

"China’s 194,000 Bitcoin Completely Sold, Claims CryptoQuant CEO",Blockviews,1i8vk7s,2025-01-24 08:37:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i8vk7s/chinas_194000_bitcoin_completely_sold_claims/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Did China sell 194,000 $BTC seized from the PlusToken scam?  

In a surprising twist, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that Chinese authorities have offloaded 194K $BTC from the PlusToken bust of 2019. While officials reported the confiscated assets were ""transferred to the national treasury,"" no clear word ever confirmed whether these Bitcoins were sold or retained. And yet, on-chain evidence seems to tell a different story.  

Ju highlights a peculiar trail, where seized $BTC made their way to Chinese exchanges like Huobi via mixers and multiple wallets. If there were no plans to sell, why go through all the steps to obfuscate transactions? This raises the possibility that the assets were cashed in discreetly.  

For those unaware, PlusToken disrupted the crypto market back in 2019 by accumulating an enormous stash of Bitcoin—between 1% and 2% of the circulating supply. This fake ""investment platform"" lured naive investors and created artificial buying pressure that fueled $BTC’s explosive rally from $3,000 to $14,000.  

However, the scam couldn’t last forever. Law enforcement agencies closed in, triggering a wave of market manipulation as PlusToken scammers dumped huge quantities of Bitcoin onto exchanges. Following its exposure, Bitcoin faced a sharp price collapse amidst one of the most infamous sell-offs in crypto’s history, dropping from nearly $14,000 to $6,000.  

As for now, Bitcoin trades at an astonishing $103,111. The question remains: if the Bitcoin from PlusToken is already gone, how might similar events shape the crypto markets of tomorrow?

Trade Republic rechnet in den Graph die Hebelverluste ein, die ich vor gut einem Jahr hatte. Für mich ist aber die Perfomance der längerfristigen Investments relevant, da ich das Hebeln schnell wieder aufgegeben habe. War damals einfach neugierig und wollte das ganze ausprobieren.
Zum Portfolio: Den ETF bespare ich monatlich mit 100€ seit ca. 2 Jahren, dazu kamen hin und wieder größere Einmalzahlungen. Die Einzeltitel habe ich nicht regelmäßig bespart sondern mit einer größeren Summe sofort gekauft. AMD und NVIDIA habe ich zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt nochmal nachgekauft. Das Thema Krypton ist für mich nebensächlich und einfach ein wenig Spielgeld. 
Zu AMD möchte ich euch fragen was ihr von der Aktie haltet. Grundsätzlich glaube ich an die Aktie und habe nicht vor zu verkaufen sondern längerfristig zu halten. Ich denke aber hin und wieder das wenn ich verkaufe, mit einer anderen Aktie mehr Rendite generieren könnte. Allerdings stört mich der Verlust und tendiere doch lieber darauf zu halten. Das das Portfolio noch nicht differenziert genug ist ist mir bewusst, mir hat allerdings noch das Geld für andere Titel gefehlt was ich in Zukunft noch angehen werde. Da auch die Frage, welche Bereiche ihr langfristig für rentabel haltet. 
Kurz noch zu mir: M22 und aktuell noch Student. Monatliches Nettoeinkommen liegt bei etwa 1800€, da ich aber Studiumsbedingt schon alleine wohne habe ich relativ hohe Fixkosten. Die 100€ in den ETF schaffe ich dennoch reden Monat. Seit Anfang des Jahres gehen 100& zusätzlich noch in einen Fond als zusätzliche Altersvorsorge. Im Oktober werde ich fertig und verdiene dann etwa 2900€ netto abzüglich 300€ PKV. Ich versuche da die Sparrate auf etwa 300-500€ zu erhöhen.
Bin auf eure Meinungen gespannt :)"

Indicators Point To An Imminent Altcoin Season,ethtrader,1i8qizr,2025-01-24 03:01:02,11,0.86,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8qizr/indicators_point_to_an_imminent_altcoin_season/,BigRon1977,Metrics,"Interest in crypto is rising to levels we saw in early 2021 when the crypto market surged past $3 trillIon in value. 

According to insights from Google Trends, queries indicating retail interest in crypto have been on a meteoric rise since November last year.

One of the most likely search terms that indicate retail interest is ""[what is crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=What%20is%20crypto&hl=en)"". As we can see from the charts below, the query is being complemented with inquiries about ""[how to buy crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=How%20to%20buy%20crypto&hl=en),"" signalling that interested persons are taking action.

[\\""What is crypto\\"" is seeing sharp rise on Google Search. ](https://preview.redd.it/bzhwmpep2wee1.jpg?width=1905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9314356f4bbe996eeb9f6413a961b1d7ba0ccc57)

Speaking of taking action, did you know that crypto apps now dominate the finance category on Apple's US app store? According to an [X post](https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1881798948832387387) by JasonYanowitz, 8 out of the top 10 finance apps in the US are crypto-related.

When we also take a look at historical patterns, hindsight tells us that [Ethereum always explodes in Q1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ho2hci/ethereum_always_explodes_in_q1_after_a_halving/) after a halving year. This metric is important because Ethereum historically rallies or sees significant momentum before other altcoins follow.

Two important metrics to also consider are [Bitcoin Dominance](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/bitcoin-dominance/) which has been ranging from 50-60% and the [Altcoin Season Index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/) which is currently tethering at 51. They are both indicative that we are on the cusp of an altcoin season that hasn't yet translated into a significant shift away from Bitcoin."

In a significant move, US President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group to draft new regulations for digital assets. This move is seen as a major win for the crypto industry, which has been advocating for clearer and more supportive regulations.

Trump, who campaigned as a ""crypto president,"" has instructed the working group to include the Treasury secretary, chairs of the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other agency heads. Their task is to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins.

This new order also addresses industry concerns about banking services, protecting crypto companies from being cut off by lenders. Additionally, it bans the creation of central bank digital currencies that could compete with existing cryptocurrencies.

The crypto market has reacted positively, with Bitcoin hitting a fresh record high of $109,071 earlier this week, though it has since adjusted to around $103,000.

🚨Just IN: Fifth Circuit Limits OFAC's Sanctioning Authority

In another significant development, the US Fifth Circuit Court has ruled that immutable smart contracts, such as those used in Tornado Cash, are not ""property"" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This decision limits the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)'s authority to sanction decentralized software protocols.

This marks the second regulatory defeat for the Treasury after a similar ruling in November 2024. The court's decision clarifies that OFAC cannot block these smart contracts due to their unique nature, which lacks the classic characteristics of property.

These rulings collectively signal a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi), potentially pushing digital assets further into the mainstream.

Might consider getting the tangem wallet as i just use a hot wallet for now. Another side note, say in 30 or 40 years if bitcoin/crypto became too powerful and the govt decided to ban or confiscate it, could i potentially just take me and my cold wallet and hop on a plane to a different country?"

Bitcoin is not like gold at all. It isn't fungible. Gold is fungible (or at least a lot more so than other currencies). Gold doesn't come permanently etched with the name of every previous owner. Stop this stupid rhetoric. Monero is more gold than Bitcoin.

Monero has a lower inflation rate than gold. Gold inflates by around 2% per year never mind eventual asteroid mining. Monero inflates by >1% per year and has an inflation rate at asymptotically 0%.

Monero is way better at being gold than Bitcoin and it's miles better at being a peer to peer digital cash system. Don't be misled by the new guys trying to sneak in this narrative.

# Electronic Arts Shares Crash 18% as Soccer Game Slump Sparks Investor Exodus and Analyst Downgrades

Electronic Arts (EA) is facing significant challenges as its stock plummets following a disappointing preliminary Q3 performance and reduced annual forecast. The company's shares dropped by approximately 18%, marking the biggest single-day decline since 2008. The primary cause of this downturn is weakness in EA's soccer franchise, particularly the EA Sports FC game (formerly FIFA), which has seen a decrease in player engagement and bookings. This unexpected slump has raised concerns among investors and analysts about the company's growth prospects.

# Texas Instruments Beats Q4 Estimates but Soft Q1 Guidance Signals Ongoing Chip Industry Challenges

Texas Instruments (TXN) reported mixed Q4 2024 earnings, beating estimates but providing a disappointing outlook for Q1 2025. The company's Q4 revenue was $4.01 billion, down 2% year-over-year but above the expected $3.87 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.30, surpassing the estimated $1.21. However, net income decreased by 12% compared to the previous year. The company's performance was affected by sluggish demand for electronic components, particularly in industrial automation and energy sectors. Despite the challenges, TXN maintained strong cash flow and returns to shareholders. Looking ahead, the company's Q1 2025 guidance fell short of expectations, with projected EPS between $0.94 and $1.16, below the consensus estimate of $1.17. Revenue is forecast to be between $3.74 billion and $4.06 billion. The soft outlook suggests that the chip industry slump may be persisting, causing TXN's stock to slip in after-hours trading. Analysts and investors are closely watching the company's performance as it navigates the current market conditions and aims to maintain its position in the semiconductor industry.

# Union Pacific Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates, Sparking Rail Sector Rally Despite Revenue Miss

Union Pacific Corporation, a major railroad operator, has reported strong fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, beating Wall Street estimates and sparking a rally in the rail sector. The company's quarterly profit rose 7% to $1.8 billion, with earnings per share of $2.91, surpassing the expected $2.78. While revenue slightly missed projections at $6.1 billion, investors were impressed by the company's efficiency gains and improved operating ratio of 58.7%. Union Pacific attributed its success to strong core pricing gains in industrial sectors, strength in international west coast imports, and reduced fuel expenses. The company's workforce productivity increased, and train productivity improved by 5% year-over-year. Despite a mixed economic forecast, Union Pacific maintained its 2025 outlook, projecting high-single to low-double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share. The positive results led to a significant stock price increase, with shares rising by about 4.3% in pre-market trading. The news has boosted confidence in the rail sector, causing other rail companies' stocks to move higher as well.

And according to the late Charlie Munger, there’s plenty of incentive for the dark arts to make more of bitcoin. If you’re still on the fence, perhaps this article from the Associated Press might be enough to give you pause.

AP—President Donald Trump’s goodwill in the cryptocurrency industry has taken a hit after he and his wife launched meme coins — a move critics say looks like an unseemly cash grab that undermines an effort to legitimize digital assets.

The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president’s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions.

The price of bitcoin and other digital assets has soared since Trump won. A lavish “Crypto Ball” Friday ahead of Trump’s inauguration sold tickets for thousands of dollars and featured a performance by the rapper Snoop Dogg.

But as that party was ongoing, Trump announced on social media he was offering his very own cryptocurrency in the form of a meme coin. The move dampened the mood for many in the crypto community.

“I really was kind of bummed out when I saw it,” said Tom Schmidt, a partner at a crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. “It just felt very grifty and cheap.”

Some crypto fans even joked on social media they missed Gary Gensler, the recently departed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who was viewed as the Biden administration’s chief crypto antagonist thanks to the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies.

Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.

Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin’s release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall. As of Tuesday afternoon, Trump’s meme coin was trading at about $45 while the Melania meme coin was at about $4.

Trump named SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as the agency’s acting chief Tuesday and Uyeda quickly announced he was launching a new crypto task force to set the SEC on a “sensible regulatory path.” Trump has promised to create a U.S. bitcoin stockpile and enact industry-friendly rules that make it easier for crypto companies to access the broader financial market.

But by associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his ability to enact reforms.

“Now, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, “Oh, it’s just a casino for these meme coins,’” said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures. “It does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.”

The sale of Trump meme coins was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In promoting the meme coin, Trump told supporters to “Have Fun!” The website selling the tokens says they are meant as expressions of support and not an investment opportunity. The coin’s website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years.

The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement that prohibits Trump from “day-to-day” decision making at the Trump Organization when he’s president and limits financial information about the business shared with him.

The president and first lady were not the only ones promoting new cryptocurrencies around the inauguration. Lorenzo Sewell, the Michigan pastor who gave a spirited inaugural invocation Monday, announced the launch of a new coin named after him, which he said would be used to benefit his church.

“I need you to do me a favor right now, I need to you to go buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin,” Sewell said in a video post on social media.
