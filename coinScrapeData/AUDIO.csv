Aite, I've tried researching where this random loot box airdrop came from which seems to be from a project called ""**Portals**"" (Website: [https://theportal.to/](https://theportal.to/) ) – which appears to be a Solana project that is currently #5 on the Magic Eden Charts, and boasts this in their [X bio](https://x.com/_portals_):

>*Play and create games on the ""Roblox of web3""*

So, the ""Roblox of Web3"" sounds cool, and their website seems legit, plus their profile on Magic Eden looks genuine too, but I can't find any confirmation that Audius is partnered with this project, nothing in my email inbox regarding this, or any where else online – the only green flag I can find is on the ""Portals"" twitter page which has Audius following them:

**But** then I see *scam alerts* that look similar to this situation like this [reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/audius/comments/18tio6c/audio_mysterybox_nft_scam_alert_audius/).

Can anyone please confirm if this is a real collaboration? If not, I want to remove it from my wallet and be aware to warn others about it... especially since I'm currently researching how to properly display ""Collectibles"" on my Audius profile, so I def don't want any scams displayed!

Thanks for any insight/feedback...

"Atris, an Announcement, and a Golden December.",audius,1hdve98,2024-12-13 23:54:03,4,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/lvsdla6dwq6e1.jpeg,glassBeadCheney,Discussion,"Honestly, I knew it was probably coming up soon, but crossing over to 1000+ $AUDIO gave me a much-needed shot of happiness today. Going from essentially no listeners on January 1 (after 3-ish years releasing beats on the platform) to 40k plays this December has been a delightful subplot to everything else in my life, good and bad. 

The good folks at Audius shared “Lost My Mind” on the platform (thereby starting the fun) something close to ten years to the day after I first started producing, I’ve been recording and making beats near-continuously in that time, and it’s the first music I ever made in my life entirely on my own that didn’t have that “demo” quality to it. At some point during my (completely, top to bottom unsuccessful) run at doing the hit songwriter-then-artist thing in my teens/early 20s, an engineer I worked with told me that “if you’re doing most things, ten years is mastery. If you’re producing records, ten years is competence.” I wanted to start doing it and the remark screwed with my head a lot at the time (I’d be the age I am now by the time I’d get any good, after all: the horror!). My professional pursuits aren’t in being a musician anymore either, so it’s all the more nuts that the guy was so dead on.

Turns out twiddling virtual knobs for a decade, trying to get the snare to sound less like a bucket of shit in vain, is a formula that meets the criteria as that dude saw them. And idk, I’ve been having this full circle here at the end of the year and figured someone else might find it as soothing a thought as I do. 

So thanks, Audius community, for the love. I love the community back, and I have a fun announcement for you that I decided ad hoc to make here, and that’s Atris. I’ll have a dedicated post for this in the next couple days with signup forms and such, but here’s the gist before I go:

*Atris is an AI-driven insight agent that helps artists, labels, and technologists make things people love on Audius.*

Anyone interested, stay tuned: if you think Atris sounds cool or useful, I want you to help me build it. It’s been a good 2024 on Audius. Here’s to the 2025 to come. 🥂"

Already 10 years... I don't think any of us have seen them go by.

Despite a slower pace of releases in recent years, we're delighted to present this compilation of 5 tracks by 5 different artists you've already heard on the label: Saumon, CKS, Wa5p, Lowel and GABS-E.

Tracks that represent the full spectrum of our artistic direction, produced by artists who share our values and our love of sound and creation.

Enjoy!

Our 10th anniversary also marks the arrival of changes in our artistic direction and our objectives as an independent label.

For a start, you'll no longer find our releases on a number of mainstream platforms that don't respect artists or aren't aligned with our values.  
Our releases will remain mainly available for purchase in high quality on Bandcamp as well as free streaming on Soundcloud, YouTube and Audius.

We're also pleased to announce the availability of more advanced support and guidance for artists with approved releases. This includes, but is not limited to: regular advice and support in terms of music production, constructive and detailed feedback regarding audio mixing and free mastering.

Our vision for the future of TDF is simple: continue to connect with passionate, curious and respectful people, and showcase their original creations, especially with a slightly broader artistic direction.

Indeed, while most of our past releases have been in the Techno spectrum, we're opening up to other genres such as House, Trance, Ambient, Soundtrack... It's all going to remain a question of eclecticism.

"An In-Depth Guide into HZP: The Easiest way to get into Sound Healing
",hzp,1cy14b7,2024-05-22 10:07:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hzp/comments/1cy14b7/an_indepth_guide_into_hzp_the_easiest_way_to_get/,GardytheWizard,,"Welcome to the HZP subreddit! Hopefully you've stumbled across this post on your search for sound healing music, meditation music, solfeggio frequency research, 432hz inquiries etc! Below you'll find a great introduction to HZP, how it works, and how you can get started today!

**Check out** [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER8T3dGikhg) **to learn more about HZP!**

If you’re at all interested in the ever-growing topic of sound healing, you’ve probably simply googled “sound healing music”. The most common type of content will pop up: meditation music. This is usually music that includes pure tones from tuning forks or singing bowls. While meditation music certainly has it’s merit, there is a large chance that you might be looking for a more casual music listening experience. Within this article, you’ll learn about [HZP](http://hzp.co/), our revolutionary app that allows you to simply re-tune any song to any [solfeggio frequency](https://solfeggiofrequencies.org/) and [432hz](https://solfeggiofrequencies.org/432-hz-not-a-solfeggio-frequency-but-a-powerful-one/). Let’s get into it.

# The Emergence of Sound Healing

Over the last couple of decades, there has been explosive growth in awareness of the power of sound healing and the magnitude of how music, tuned around a specific frequency, can improve different symptoms. People from all over the world are reporting that certain frequencies have helped them overcome anxiety, reduce stress, improve their sleep, focus, and more!

App developers, musicians, and curators have put out an immense amount of material about this topic, but again, it is mostly meditation music.

# HZP: The Hertz Player

One app, however, stands out amongst the rest, allowing you to retune ANY song to ANY solfeggio frequency and 432hz. It does all in real-time, without having to waste precious time converting files that would clutter our hard drive and make it harder to manage our playlists.

This app works the same to other popular music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, etc.

The best part about it? Re-Tuning the music is so easy and so powerful that you will actually wonder why we have not had access to something like this all along! So, without further ado, let’s get into [HZP](http://hzp.co/).

# Getting Started

Okay so first things first, you can create your free account at [HZP.CO](http://hzp.co/), then if you’d like to download the app just go to the downloads page, where it is available on just about every single platform: IOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Huawei, the Amazon Store, and more! However if you don’t want to download anything that is totally fine, you can always access HZP on any web-browser like Google Chrome, Safari, or Edge. You can do so by going to [app.hzp.co](http://app.hzp.co/).

Next, as a side note, the only HZP version that does not play your own music files is the web version, since it’s literally impossible to connect an entire folder to your browser. So if you want to re-tune your own music files you will need to use on of the dedicated apps.

# The Pure Tone Test

Before we even show you how to re-tune any song to any solfeggio frequency and 432hz, let’s start by testing how the app actually re-tunes a 440hz pure tone. I am going to be checking to see how a pure frequency changes from 440hz to the different frequencies to validate that the app actually does what it says it does.

So here is the thing about musical tuning: Our instruments are tuned to a lot of different frequencies. For example, a piano has 88 keys so each key is tuned to a different frequency, as you might expect. However, 85 years ago the universal concert pitch was created agreed upon that all musicians would first tune the A note in the 4th octave (A4) to 440hz then work their way up and down the chromatic scale, correctly tuning each note and making sure the interval between each is the same.

So, in order to correctly understand how HZP handles re-tuning 440hz to the solfeggio frequencies, we need to understand that it is not directly tuning 440hz to, let’s say, 174hz (the lowest of the solfeggio frequencies). This would not make sense as the music would then be so low we wouldn’t be able to hear many of the frequencies. So, what HZP does is retune the standard 440hz to another frequency close by, which will then shift other notes like C5, F3, etc. to one of the solfeggio frequencies. That way these desired frequencies will be included in the listening experience.

So, here is each frequency that HZP retunes 440 to for each Solfeggio Frequency:

For 174hz, HZP tunes 440hz to 438.48hz.

If we tune 440hz to 452.37hz, then the C#4 note becomes 285hz.

440hz tuned to 444.4hz will make G4 396hz.

Tuning 440hz to 441.8hz will make the G#4 417hz.

440hz to 444hz will make C5 become 528hz!

Taking 440hz to 452hz will make D#5 639hz.

440hz to 416hz will make F#5 741hz.

If we tune 440hz to 416hz it will make G#5 852hz.

And if we tune 440hz to 429hz, then B5 becomes 963hz!

Now this all might seem a bit complicated, so here is a little graphic to get you up to speed.

# How to Re-Tune any Song

So now that you know how the re-tuning process works, let’s now get into HZP and try re-tuning a really popular song, something like a Michael Jackson song.

You see, HZP is just like any other music streaming platform: it has millions of popular and indie songs that you might find anywhere else. It is supported by [Audius](http://audius.co/), which hosts millions of songs.

So, we can just search up Michael Jackson on the left hand navigation menu, and pick any song! Alternatively, HZP also offers you a Sound Healing tab if you ARE looking for meditation music, chants, etc. You can also search through an artists menu or genre menu to help you discover new music you might love!

Then, while the song is playing, at the bottom of the page you will see the magical frequency button. Clicking this will pop-up a frequency changing menu. Here you’ll see all nine of the solfeggio frequencies, 432hz, and the universal tuning, 440hz. Simply click on any frequency you want to re-tune the playing song in real-time! It’s just that easy. It doesn’t stop or pause the song to re-tune, it all happens instantly.

You can always access the frequency changing button at the bottom near the other expected playback options, or you can access it on the left-hand side as well.

If you are looking to re-tune your own music files, you will need to be in one of HZP’s dedicated apps. Once you are, on the right hand side, you’ll see a library button. Here you can select any folder on your device, and HZP will pull any audio files (.WAV’s, .MP3’s, etc.) and add them to HZP. Then, the process will be the exact same as re-tuning the Michael Jackson song! Just click on the frequency changing button, and select your desired tuning!

# The Built In Visualizer

HZP is not just an average music streaming platform that allows you to re-tune your music. HZP also offers a built-in audio-responsive visualizer provided by [SYQEL](http://syqel.com/)! You might have caught it when looking at the playback options, but there is a flame button you’ll see at the bottom. This is the visualizer button. Simply click it and you’ll be transported to the visualizer, which will automatically cycle through a TON of visualizers. So sit back, relax, and enjoy this one of a kind experience.

# HZP’s Playlists

Similar to all of the other popular music apps, HZP includes the ability to create your own playlists, but unlike any other app, you can easily tap and hold on a song, then select multiple songs at once to add to any playlist! This saves a ton of time and makes it super simply to make lots of playlists for any occasion. Then, within your playlists you can always remove any songs you might have accidentally added. You can also switch up the order of the songs as you might expect.

The like feature is also like many other music apps: you can hit the heart icon at the button near the playback options, then HZP will add that song to your favorites playlist, making is super easy to quickly add songs you might have discovered.

# Share Your Songs, in any Frequency

The last hidden nugget of HZP is the sharing capability. Whenever you listen to music from the Audius catalog, you’ll see the share button. This will automatically copy the song to your device’s clipboard, so you can easily paste it in a message or post on social media. But check this out — it doesn’t just copy the generic song you were listening to, it will also remember what frequency you were listening to that song in!

Whenever someone clicks on your link they will be greeted with a dedicated play page where they can listen to the song in the frequency you were listening to, but they are not limited to that! They can easily re-tune the song themselves while they are listening to the song you shared, to personalize the listening experience for themselves, AND they can even enjoy the visuals, all without having to even register for an account!

# Put your Search to Rest

There are also many other features not outline in this article, like customizing the color of your UI, premium options, and more! So, put your search for meditation music, 432hz tuned music, solfeggio frequency music, sound healing music, and more to REST now that you’ve discovered HZP. HZP makes sound healing easy, as it introduces the life changing power of sound healing to a more casual audience. Make sure to check it out at [HZP.CO](http://hzp.co/)!"

I had taken a masterclass with him, and loved his approach to creating music, so when I saw that a SoundCloud alternative was going to have a live concert with him, I signed up. 
Now, I got 94 tracks there. I love the sound quality, the community and the concept of $AUDIO.
Because music transcends cash and fame. Music is beyond. 
This track used to be an Audius exclusive. After it trended, I added it to my latest album (""Divine Splinters""). Electronica with soul. 
The song was written in a library in Norway. I had just read about the state of the world, and was feeling a bit down. ""Be the Change"" (often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi) started circulating in my mind, so I put a song to the title. 🕊️☮️❤️"

Writing here about what just happened to me.

I have discovered in my Ledger app that I’ve received these 2 NFT from Audius as I’ve been holding their token for a while (Screenshot attached).

I went on the website specified in the NFT to claim rewards.

Connected my Ledger to the website through MetaMask.

Signed and approved a few “receiving fees”. I thought I was claiming/paying fees to receive the air drop (mystery gift). There was nothing saying that I’m about to transfer all my tokens.

Then nothing happened.

In a minute or so I found out that my Audius account is empty and I’ve sent all the tokens to some random account.

I got scammed.

Has anyone experienced it?
What your advice would be? Is there any way to get the tokens back?
How these 2 NFTs appeared in my Ledger and is it related to Audius.
Should I contact MetaMask and Audius support?

Thanks for not judging too much and your advice in advance."

Safely and securely conducting over a billion transactions per year, Interac e-Transfer is used by 90% of all Canadians to send CAD electronically. So what better partner to help us further our mission of accelerating the global adoption of crypto so that everyone can achieve financial freedom and inclusion?

To celebrate, we’ve reduced our Interac e-Transfer fee to 0.95%, providing cost-effective access to Kraken’s excellent spot pricing via deep liquidity and tight trading spreads.

### 8 new listings for Canadian clients

Because we’re committed to being a bridge to the most exciting areas of crypto, we will soon be making eight new crypto assets available for trading in Canada through our secure and reliable trading platform. These include:

* Astar ([ASTR](https://www.kraken.com/convert/astr/cad))

Brainstorming For Soundstage Events,audius,14yuk64,2023-07-13 15:50:28,4,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/audius/comments/14yuk64/brainstorming_for_soundstage_events/,brokenblythe,Discussion,"Hi everyone,  
With the latest incentives to host a show on Soundstage, I was thinking we should all share ideas on **how to market our events beyond the Audius community**. I was hoping we could use this thread to brainstorm ideas on what will bring the most people in to check out the shows.

I will share some ideas I have here and hopefully that encourages everyone else to share their ideas.

***My goal is to eventually collect these ideas that the official Audius blog will write about and post.***  


# Work with a collective.

1. Collectives will be a great place to get people who are interested in you or your genres.
2. This can be an opportunity to showcase various artists from the collective.
3. Increased reach, encourage collective members to share the event.

# Communicate with friends and family in personal messages.

1. Don't send a gigantic copy paste that will get ignored. Short and sweet!
2. Don't hold any expectations that they will show up. I've realized the most unreliable people to appear for events are the people I've invited that I know IRL.
3. Post to your socials multiple times a month about it at different hours of the day. Try not to be spammy or it just makes people mute you.

# Sound checks and customize your space.

1. If you can utilize the posters to really bring your stage to life with your custom art it will make your stage look more unique to you than the vanilla stage provided.
2. Test your audio equipment multiple times before the event. Ideally a week before, the day before, and the day of.
3. Find someone to help you do sound checks, otherwise you may miss errors.
4. Work with Simlink in the Audius Discord #soundstage channel to ensure your event is listed in advance and see what recommendations he has for your sound delivery.

Those are all of my ideas right now, and I'm looking forward to anything people come up with and want to share here (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞       ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)"
A Refresher On Uploading To Audius,audius,14cxevy,2023-06-18 18:39:38,11,0.92,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/audius/comments/14cxevy/a_refresher_on_uploading_to_audius/,brokenblythe,Resource,"Whether you're new here or an OG, this information will always be important when maximizing streaming playback quality for **Audius**.

First off there's **no normalization**, so you are responsible for whatever LUFs go blasting or whispering into people's ears. 

# Audio Summary

For best quality, aim to upload audio files with the following attributes:

* Lossless Format - WAV, FLAC, AIFF, etc
* A Sample Rate of 48000 (48*kHz*)
* No Dithering
* Final Limiter Ceiling on your master chain between -0.3 dB & -0.8 dB  


# Cover Art Image Upload Summary

For the best possible image quality for your Audius cover artwork, use:

* An image with dimensions of at least 1000x1000 pixels
* Exported in a lossless format

🚀 Ethereum Whale's Valuation Surges to $391 Million 📈,ptpwallet,13slpmb,2023-05-26 15:08:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptpwallet/comments/13slpmb/ethereum_whales_valuation_surges_to_391_million/,ptpwallet,," 

The crypto market has been buzzing with the tremendous hype of memecoins since the start of 2023. From Shibarium to Dogecoin's Twitter cameo, the ""memecoin season"" has captivated investors. Amidst this meme frenzy, the trading patterns of crypto whales have come into focus.

Recently, a renowned crypto whale tracker, shed light on the activity of one of the top 300 Ethereum whales. The whale address 0x46f8 has witnessed an astounding increase in valuation, soaring nearly 1800% in just a year. Its value has surged from $20.5 million to an impressive $391 million.

According to on-chain data from Etherscan, this account has initiated 1,803 transactions involving 256 different assets on the Ethereum blockchain. As of now, it holds a significant amount of 58,885 ETH. Notably, the whale has also accumulated a staggering 4.88 trillion SHIB alongside various other memecoins.

Furthermore, its diverse portfolio includes metaverse tokens such as Decentraland (MANA), Render Token (RNDR), The Sandbox (SAND), Gala (GALA), Axie Infinity (AXS), ApeCoin (APE), and Enjin Coin (ENJ). Additionally, it holds Web3 tokens like Basic Attention Token (BAT), Audius (AUDIO), Chiliz (CHZ), and tokens from various DeFi protocols.

The surge in valuation and the diverse asset holdings of this Ethereum whale provide an interesting insight into the evolving crypto landscape. The memecoin frenzy continues to capture the market's attention, and whale activity plays a significant role in shaping the industry.

Stay tuned for more updates on the latest developments in the crypto space!"
Music NFT's,SJCcryptoclub,13or05e,2023-05-22 09:30:34,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SJCcryptoclub/comments/13or05e/music_nfts/,ButterscotchLarge416,,"Seems to me the music industry is long overdue for disruption. The current ""Web2"" model is where the middlemen make the most money off music makers (pardon alliteration). The ""Web3"" model utilizes blockchain to  enable verifiable ownership of music, so instead of a record label ""owning"" 80% of the artist's song or whatever, the fans can own as much of a percentage as the artists dictate. This cuts out the middleman and puts the artists and fans dealing directly with each other. This was not possible before.

Here's an article going into a bit (pardon pun... or don't) more depth: [https://www.airnfts.com/post/best-nft-marketplaces-for-music](https://www.airnfts.com/post/best-nft-marketplaces-for-music)

It is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and allows artists to upload, monetize, and distribute their music without the need for intermediaries like record labels or streaming services.

Audius uses a decentralized network of nodes to store and distribute music files. This approach allows for greater control and ownership of the music by the artists, as well as greater transparency and efficiency in the distribution process. Additionally, Audius uses a native token, AUDIO, to incentivize users to participate in the platform and provide feedback.

One of the key features of Audius is its social media-like approach to music discovery. Users can follow their favorite artists and discover new music through curated playlists and social recommendations. The platform also offers features like in-app messaging and live streaming, which allow for greater engagement between artists and fans.

Audius has already gained significant traction in the music industry, with over 5 million monthly active users and partnerships with major artists like deadmau5, RAC, and 3LAU. The platform has also raised funding from major venture capital firms like General Catalyst and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Overall, Audius is a promising project that aims to disrupt the music industry by providing a more decentralized and artist-friendly alternative to traditional streaming services. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it is subject to market volatility and should be approached with caution."

Get Ready For the Top 3 Upcoming Coinbase Listings in February 2023,cryptostan,10kxuvn,2023-01-25 07:48:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostan/comments/10kxuvn/get_ready_for_the_top_3_upcoming_coinbase/,The_Cryptostan,,"Coinbase is among several crypto sites where you can keep track of new cryptocurrencies as they emerge.  The platform usually manages a daily trading volume of over $1 billion. Many fresh investors typically watch for new cryptocurrencies to launch on Coinbase. 

However, there are occasions when it is best to invest before the listing since by the time Coinbase has provided an update, demand and consequently price will have significantly increased.

Here are three forthcoming cryptocurrencies that might be viable choice for your portfolio.

1. Threshold (T), which is trading for $0.05 at the moment and was produced through an on-chain merger between NuCypher and Keep Network, surged by an astounding 94% in the hours following Coinbase's announcement that it would be included in its listing roadmap.
2. Audius is a popular altcoin that will be listed on Coinbase soon. Since the beginning of 2023, the coin has steadily increased. Its current price of $0.20, an increase of 6.30% over the past 24 hours, falls between its immediate support level and resistance level for the cryptocurrency AUDIO.
3. Axelar provides secure cross-chain communication for Web3. With only one click, its architecture enables dApp users to engage with any asset or application. With a $1.75 million 24-hour trading volume, the price of Axelar is currently $0.5852 USD.

So, which one will you pick from this batch ?"
Audius up about 37% Today. Any ideas why?,CryptoCurrency,10km49m,2023-01-24 20:15:29,0,0.38,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10km49m/audius_up_about_37_today_any_ideas_why/,Justin534,MARKETS,"Not sure if I'll actually get any actual legitimate non shit posts in this sub but might as well give it a shot. Anyways Audius is a streaming music platform that uses AUDIO token for the currency in an economy involving artists, node operators that relay streams, and listeners. At least I think that's the idea. Last time I looked at the platform though it didn't seem like users are paying AUDIO to content providers though. Would really like to pay microtransactions for streams that goes directly to content makers.

Anyways just noticed it was up 37% in the last 24 hours at the time I'm looking at it. Looks like it's up on the most volume since the FTX debacle. But I'm not finding any relevant news. Anyone know if something is going on?"
Use Cases for Moons... Again,CryptoCurrency,10jqe63,2023-01-23 18:03:48,0,0.39,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10jqe63/use_cases_for_moons_again/,Justin534,MOONS 🌕,"Edit: Well it's clear I had far higher expectations for this group than is reasonable. Tl;Dr What does an economy for a community that's 99% trolls and shit posters look like? Actually mildly serious. Could be something there.

u/ahabraken posted this recently, and it's a very good question.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10fwpsl/what_could_be_some_great_usecases_for_moons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Ever since some time in 2021 when I saw the huge laundry list of coins and tokens, realizing that what's happening here is was much much bigger than Ethereum and Bitcoin. And it's much larger than a network for decentralized money. It's about individual sovereignty, it's about potentially anarchistic DAOs, it's about cutting out middle men, it's about the artist or any person doing work getting 100% of the value they've created, it's about not knowing how these technologies will change different industries or simply aspects of life when it touches them but whatever it touches it certainly does make it interesting. It's about public open markets and systems that are truly free, unpermissioned, and censorship resistant. It's a bizzaro space where libertarian capitalism and libertarian communism seem to overlap in a way I never imagined could be possible creating something completely new.

What took me the longest time to wrap my head around was just what money is. Then the light bulb moment. Money doesn't need to be backed by anything. What gives money value are the goods and services people exchange using it as a medium of exchange. Money is what allows economies to happen and economies beyond any extremely small size needs money to function.

Where does the value of Ether (Yes and SOL, AVAX, MATIC, etc) come from? It's core value is derived from an economy of people selling their technological resources to contribute to a decentralized virtual machine and those wishing to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the network. The more demand there is for transactions, smart contracts, and dapps the more valuable smart contract system tokens are. Less demand? Less valuable.

Audius? An economy for streaming music involving artists, listeners, and node operators to relay the streams. The currency is Audio and the greater the supply of artists and demand from listeners the more valuable the token becomes

My point with this is money and an economy (exchange of goods and services) are one in the same thing. An economy = exchange and production of goods and services through which money is used as a medium. Add therefore money is backed simply by the value of the goods and services in an economy which uses that money.

Now before cryptocurrencies the smallest money supply we had was for an economy of a nation state. And it makes sense for money to be useful it needs to be a general unit of exchange, it must not have wildly fluctuating value against a basket of goods and services for the national economy, it cannot be easily created by anyone that wants it, and to accomplish this it has historically needed monetary policy to be centralized.

But now we're living in an era where the smallest economy doesn't need to be the nation state. We can have economies that is as small as a network for streaming music.

But when u/ahabraken asked for ideas about use cases for a lot of people had suggestions like ""Reddit should do this, Reddit should do that."" But all these comments ignore the entire point of the decentralized permissionless nature of all this. We don't wait for others to build an economy for us. We build it ourselves.

And when we're thinking about use cases for moons, and if we can start thinking about an economy using moons we have to ask what is our community about? What kinds of goods and services makes sense for this community? It wouldn't make sense for AUDIO to be used for goods and services that don't have anything to do with music. Especially since money is now programmable to suit highly specific economies. And does our community stretch beyond this subreddit? Do people also get moons in these subreddits?

https://photos.app.goo.gl/nvwNeQftK3c6Tb6bA

Some things that come to my mind when thinking about this subreddit and what might be a good service for the community we have here involve communication, discussion, dissemination of information, investing, analytics. What else comes to mind for you?

I've been trying to think of my own little crypto projects. One is simply a portfolio tracker. One that makes it easy for people to add different chains, protocols, exchanges, wallets, etc. Maybe if I'm successful with that then add some functionality to compare different chains in terms of value transferred across the network, daily transactions, TPS, etc. Maybe other things like wallet integrations and being a front end for many different protocols. Right now I'm just focused on making a simple portfolio tracker that will be run on a Linux command line interface. Though if there's enough interest it shouldnt be too difficult to make sure it plays nice on other platforms. Why? Because I have the details of all my assets and investments right now spread across 2 portfolio trackers and a Google keep note. It's not the greatest system.

So what's do all you think about this idea being a service in an economy that uses Moons? Perhaps microtransactions can be used.

I also like backgammon. It's a fun gambling game that is simple to learn, hard to master, and involves luck and strategy. Guess what? I can't find an online backgammon that allows people to play for money (dollars or cryptocurrency). My thought? Make one. Moons could be the token people use to play with. Would that make sense for an economy involving this community and moons?

Before replying with an idea for use cases for moons Please write what you think an economy that uses Moons as its currency is all about and how your idea fits with that, what a moons based economy should be all about? Also please reply with ideas that doesn't rely on someone specific making it (like Reddit) think about ideas that even if you can't make it, anyone else could as long as they have the knowledge and resources."

Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 5 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $7.98

Enjoy 4333% Gains :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede And Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

When Newtons Wave reaches the intersection as shown on the chart, then it will turn.

The date and time at which it will reach the intersection, is dependent on human behavior.

The distance between peaks never changes, but the time it takes to travel to them can. This is based on the frequency of purchases and sales. (Like wind in the sails). The stronger the wind, the quicker the distance will be traveled.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

ℹ️ This contest has a twist! Rather than working with someone else's stems, your challenge is to take any 2, 3, 4 or 5 tracks you've released this year and remix them into a single cohesive piece. Your remix should show how you've evolved as an artist throughout 2022! Crazy ideas are strongly encouraged.

🔖 To submit, upload your remix to Audius with the ""AudiusRecap2022"" tag. From there, I will locate your track and add it [to the submissions playlist](https://audius.co/farfetched/playlist/audiusrecap2022-136295).

📝 Your remix will only be considered once it's included in this playlist. If you're concerned about your submission not appearing, please reach out to [me](t.me/AmazingPlaylists).

🎨 ALSO: If you're proficient in Photoshop, I have created .psd's you can use for the cover art of your submission. See the Google Drive link below for the files and further instructions:

📅 Submission deadline: **1 December 2022**

💜 The top ten most favorited tracks by the submission deadline will enter a judging phase featuring @farfetched and other prominent members of the Audius community. They will select three winners to receive the following prizes:

🥇1st place: 500 $AUDIO

🥈2nd place: 300 $AUDIO

Good luck, and have fun!
