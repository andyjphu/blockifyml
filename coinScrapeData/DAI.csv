Subsemnata -23F-, sunt intr o relatie cu un om absolut minunat -33M- de un an si jumatate. Il iubesc de mi e greu sa exprim in cuvinte cat de mult si stiu ca si el la fel.

Dar de cand sunt cu el impreuna, ceva paraziti mi s au pus pe creier si  parca mi s a activat instinctul matern (stiu ca suna ciudat) si pur si simplu am seri in care adorm cu ochii inlacrimati la gandul ca imi doresc un copil. Si nu imi doresc la modul vreau sa am o fetita sa i prind codite si sa o imbrac in rochita. Imi doresc la modul mi se pare minunat ca din iubirea a doua persoane se poate naste a 3-a. Gasesc asta ca fiind ceva minunat, divin. Sa poti sa dai viata, sa iubești necondiționat. El stie asta, mereu am vorbit deschis despre acest subiect, pentru mine fiind un deal breaker deoarece nu (mai) caut “distractii”. Impartim aceleasi dorinte in acest sens, dar el crede ca ar mai trebui sa asteptam o vreme. Sa mai petrecem timp doar noi doi, sa ne bucuram unul de celalalt. Si ma frustreaza chestia asta. Si ma frustreaza ca sunt frustrata.  Nu vreau sa pun presiune pe el in niciun fel, sa se simta constrans.

Re: Mantis Beings Report, Faber, Virginia   
Date: December 19, 2015  

Dear Linda, 

I studied at the Monroe Institute from Oct 2000 to 2006, then from 2010 to 2012. I am 74 years old now and have kept these experiences to myself. I have followed your work, Linda, since the publication of your 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities. I enjoy the information you bring to the public on Coast to Coast AM and on your Earthfiles news website. The Mantis beings are real entities, this I know. 

After listening to your monthly report on Coast to Coast AM Dec 17th-18th, I decided to write to you and share my personal experience with the Mantis beings. This experience occurred in 2012 while at the Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia. I was taking a program called Starlines and one exercise was for the class to astral project through deep meditation to the far reaches of the universe. We went to different galaxies for our experiences. I have been involved with consciousness work there at the Monroe Institute for 9 years as a participant. It has changed my life completely since Oct 2000. I hope you find my following report interesting as I did and still do. 

Friday, July 20, 2012 – 11:41 AM East Coast — Monroe Institute session, Faber, VA, goal to astrally project ourselves to the Andromeda galactic center and report back with what we experienced. 

[Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, NGC 224 or Great Andromeda Nebula, is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from our Milky Way galaxy in the constellation Andromeda. The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way galaxy.

“I traveled to the an area near the galaxy Andromeda and called for a guide to show me something about the Akashic records. I found myself inside a ship in a large room all metallic standing there facing a large metal-looking dais with 6 very tall beings, who were sitting around the dais, and yet were taller than my height standing there. 

The 6 beings were wearing purple-hooded-robes and their faces were long, angular and hawk-like. Their skin was pale white with very large slanted eyes that were black with red irises. Their noses were long and straight and came to a sharp point with a small slit for a mouth. 

Linda, here are 2 good images of the face I found on the web that are pretty spot on to what I encountered, except the skin was pale white and the black eyes had red irises. The shape of the head is right and so is the long bridge of the nose and the slit for a mouth — really close. 

[The standing \/leaning body pic was how they looked when they stood up with the hooded robes covering their body. I could tell they were thin and they bent over slightly like the image when they walked out the room. Funny thing I didn’t see or notice their hands, which were hidden under the sleeves of the robes.](https://preview.redd.it/doejnz99b7fe1.jpg?width=363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=158ff5a26ae90f6967c0781cbe5834305d92fc84)

 I wasn’t afraid at all seeing them or how they looked. The leader, who was sitting in the center of the group, spoke to me telepathically and said. ‘You have come far and evolved much. We are pleased.’ 

He then looked from left to right at his fellow beings and they each nodded from left to right looking right at me, I surmised in approval. They finished nodding and the leader stood up rising 10 to 12 feet tall. He turned facing the back wall and a huge door slid open and he led the way out down a huge passage way with each member of the group following him. I could see the hall had an orange glow to it. Along the hall, there were what looked like carvings and pillars. The door slid closed and I was alone. I was intrigued, more curious, and in our next session decided to go back. 

“Akashic Records” 

\[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – In theosophy and anthroposophy, the Akashic records — a term coined in the late 19th century from akasha, the Sanskrit word for “sky”, “space”, “luminous”, or “aether” — are a compendium of thoughts, events, and emotions believed by theosophists to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the astral plane. There are anecdotal accounts but no scientific evidence for existence of the Akashic records.\] 

Before the next session I asked to get what ever information I needed to get. I found myself standing on a metal platform in space with the tall leader of that group of hooded figures from before. I was surprised it was him with me and he obviously was there to show me something. In front of us was a gigantic cavern of light that you could see inside of. There were books and scrolls and what appeared to be files and TV screens all lit up out there in space floating. 

The leader said to me, “This is what you know as the Akashic records. In each star system that has intelligent life with souls inhabiting them, they have an equivalent ‘Hall of Gifts.’ I inquired as to why they called the records ‘gifts’ and he said, ‘All experiences are gifts to the Creator. We are given the gift of life and the gift we return to the Creator is the experiences we have. There is no good or bad or right or wrong — just experience. This is how the  Creator experiences itself in infinite ways through its creations that create new and unique   
experiences.’ 

We could see from our vantage point thousands of beings floating in from the darkness of space to enter the cavern and deposit their different gifts of experience and preparing for another journey with a new gift of life to be experienced. Far in the distance, we saw thousands more beings leaving on their new journey among the stars. 

“I-There,” Multi-dimensional Soul in Two or More Places At Once 

\[ Editor’s Note: The Monroe Institute astral projector writing about his experience with praying mantis uses the term “I-There” to mean “an aspect” of his multi-dimensional self or soul. “That can be virtually anywhere in different time lines, other dimensions and forms that we humans can sometimes recognize when we’re Out of Body (OOB). When we are told to astral project our consciousness to a certain location, we are then in another timeline or place — yet still fully aware that we are still attached to the physical body resting in the Chec unit at The Monroe Institute.”\] 

As I stood there with my guide, I wondered if some of those beings might be an I-THERE or 2 of mine? 

The tall leader heard my thoughts and said, ‘Of course there are some of your I-THERE in the mix.’ 

He then looked down at me and I felt a knowing, a kinship, beyond any knowledge I would have had before coming there. His large, expressionless, black eyes with the red irises suddenly allowed me to penetrate beyond the physical appearance. I saw an imperceptible smile from his thin small mouth and his right eye winked at me. 

He said ‘I am one of your I-THERE.’ 

I was so at peace feeling safe and complete. I found myself looking back at this being, my I-THERE and my I-THERE from the ship, standing on that platform looking at the other I-THERE of mine entering and leaving the ‘Hall of Gifts’ and the cavern of light. 

I then knew my purpose for being here: There is only One I-THERE and we are it. We are expressions of the ‘Source,’ ‘Oneness.’ The beings there around the table looked like giant Mantis-type beings, but not exactly like the type we see as insects on Earth. I didn’t feel any fear or threat from them at all. It made me feel as if they knew I was coming and were expecting me. The leader was warm and comforting with his presence. 

I still remember seeing from my I-THERE self the 2 of us looking out in space with the leader’s hand on my shoulder. My view point was from above and behind as my astral body was aware of my physical body lying on the bed in the check unit at the Monroe Institute. I could also see my second astral body standing in front of the Mantis beings on the ship. Now I could see both the leader and that astral body of Me standing on the platform in space watching the souls arriving and departing from the Hall of Gifts. 

I have looked for pictures while conscious that looked like the Mantis beings and found some that were very similar, but not exactly like them. Perhaps our minds affect a subtle change in what we are seeing as not to cause fear in us. They themselves may have a method to soften and make their appearance more acceptable to us. 

I was told while in deep meditation the answer to this question in 1999. ‘Who am I and who was I in another lifetime?’ 

The answer was: ‘I am Ashkelon, the Wanderer. I have been here in many forms and many guises.’ I was told that I was a scribe, who traveled to many places to record the behavior of humans and to live among them to understand them better. I was then to report my observations and experiences at the termination of that physical life. I would return to ‘Home’ to download the complete data of my human experience. I have existed in many forms of life and my soul evolves from these adventures in learning.’ "

"Gostar, mas não sentir falta. Isso existe?",desabafos,1i9w3c0,2025-01-25 15:23:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/desabafos/comments/1i9w3c0/gostar_mas_não_sentir_falta_isso_existe/,Friendly_Board8493,Relacionamento,"Estou/estava conversando com uma menina a 1 mês e meio, ela é bem mais nova, ela tem 20 e eu 30 (sou mulher também kk), não fico atras de gente mais nova, mas só aconteceu, enfim.

A gente nem se conhece pessoalmente ainda. Tento marcar mas ela me enrola. Eu sou demi e ela também, coisas casuais não nos interessam, e é bem difícil eu me interessar por alguém, mas quando eu me interesso geralmente é bem forte (ela disse ser assim também).

Eu realmente queria ir com calma, até porque sei que uma menina de 20 não vai ter a maturidade que procuro. Mas com poucos dias de conversa ela disse que já gostava de mim, daí eu fiquei tipo “Ah, fodase a calma” e fui deixando me envolver por ela também. A gente acabou se curtindo bastante mesmo só no virtual.

Todas as iniciativas foram partindo dela, ela que disse que gosta primeiro, dai depois ela disse que até excluiu o app em que a gente se conheceu porque quer ficar só comigo, e ela também disse que realmente tem intenções sérias comigo conforme a gente for se conhecendo. Ela também tem muito ciumes de mim, e diz que tem muito medo de me perder e etc etc etc.

Ok, correspondi a tudo (duas emocionadas kkkk) e queria sair pra conhecer, só que a gente sempre se desentende nessa questão porque ela é bi (mas com preferência em mulheres), mas ela é acostumada com que os homens cheguem nela sem ela ter que fazer esforço, mas eu disse que queria que ela se esforçasse por mim também, não deixar tudo pra mim. Dai a gente acaba se desentendendo por isso e não saimos ainda.

Agora sobre a pergunta do título do post. No começo do mês, em um desses desentendimentos ela já estava a uma semana sem falar comigo, eu achei que ela nem ia voltar mais, ai fui atrás cobrar satisfação (não temos nada, eu sei) e ela explicou que não tinha me dado ghosting e que ela ia voltar depois, que só tinha ficado chateada. Ok, voltamos a nos falar e ficou tudo normal.

Essa semana conversamos sobre a mesma coisa de novo, ela tinha aceitado sair comigo, mas só porque eu que chamei, dai falei novamente que era chato só eu tomar iniciativa pra sair (e geralmente só eu que inicio as conversas, tem isso também), daí ela disse que não ficou chateada comigo dessa vez por entrar nesse assunto de novo, mas que ela estava meio sensível e que não queria ter “conversas desconfortáveis”, e me deixou falando sozinha pela segunda vez. Ja fazem 5 dias isso. Dessa vez não fui atrás e estamos sem nos falar.

Dai eu me pergunto. Como a uma pessoa diz que gosta de você, que quer ficar só com você, que quer namorar futuramente contigo, mas ela passa 1 semana a fio sem falar com você? Tipo porra? Não sente falta?! Porque a gente conversa dia/noite/madrugada inteira quando estamos de boas. E ela disse que nem estava chateada dessa vez de agora, e mesmo assim fica vários dias sem falar comigo. Cara eu não consigo ser assim. Até uns 2 dias acho ok, mas ela some 1 semana e eu fico sem nem saber se ela vai voltar ou não.

E eu definitivamente não queria ter que ir atrás dela novamente, acho humilhante. Daí to aqui esperando pra ver se volta ou se sei la. Fora que ja falei da outra vez que ela fez isso, o quanto isso de sumir/ghosting me magoa, que se ela gosta de espaço, tudo bem, mas que me avisasse antes (mesmo a gente não namorando ainda, a gente se trata com respeito afetivo e temos essa liberdade de dizer o que incomoda ou não, o problema é que nem sempre ela cumpre a parte dela. Já tentei conversar sério sobre essas coisas, mas não adianta).

Ela tem os combinhos de ansiedade e depressão e mesmo quando a gente está de boas ela é uma pessoa bem fechada. Mas o que me assusta é a frieza de sumir por vários dias e aparentemente nem sentir minha falta. Não sei se isso é algo normal ou só perdeu o interesse e não quer falar. Foda que 2 dias antes dela sumir essa semana, ela estava me fazendo mil promessas de amor kkkkkk."

Resolvi perguntar ao tarot se valia a pena investir nesse relacionamento, disse que valia a pena sim mas que deveríamos mudar muita coisa, porém disse que ele trocava mensagens com a ex ficante, que ele não sabia oque fazer e que tinha sentimentos por ela ainda, confrontei ele e ele assumiu que foi sim atrás dela a duas semanas atrás, disse que não gostava dela, só queria conversar sobre um assunto da escola e acabou conversando sobre outras coisas da vida mas sem segundas intenções da parte dele.

Terminamos depois dessa conversa, mas o fato dela me dizer que valia a pena investir no relacionamento me deixa confusa, tenho medo de me arrepender, sobre ele gostar dela também tenho minhas dúvidas, na época em que eles ficavam nos éramos amigos, ela queria relacionamento porém ele sempre disse que não queria e que não gostava dela, teve atitudes ate bem babacas sobre ela, mas isso não vem ao caso. Não sei realmente sigo oque foi falado que vale a pena investir, tentou realmente recomeçar e passo por cima disso, ou so deixo como está e vou seguir minha vida"

**A 40x40 grid fantasy castle map with a grand hall at the center, flanked by two spiral staircases leading to upper levels. The hall is lined with banners and chandeliers, while side rooms include a kitchen with a large hearth, a dining hall with a long table, and a throne room with a raised dais. Secret passages are hidden behind tapestries, and traps are marked by loose floor tiles. Terrain variations include polished marble floors, wooden planks, and cobblestone paths. Entrance is a drawbridge at the east, and exits are through portcullises at the north and west. Combat spaces are designed around the hall and throne room.**

**A 20x20 grid desert tomb map with a central burial chamber containing a sarcophagus and hieroglyph-covered walls. Side rooms include a treasure room with golden artifacts, a trap-filled corridor with swinging blades, and a guardian room with animated statues. Secret passages are hidden behind sliding walls, and traps are marked by sand pits and collapsing ceilings. Terrain includes sand, stone tiles, and cracked walls. Entrance is a stone doorway at the north, and exits are through hidden passages at the south and east. Combat spaces are designed around the burial chamber and guardian room.**

**A top-down fantasy RPG map with a 30x30 grid layout, featuring a central circular chamber with a glowing magical rune at its center, surrounded by four smaller rectangular rooms connected by narrow stone corridors. Each room has a specific purpose: a library with towering bookshelves, an armory with weapon racks, a ritual chamber with a pentagram etched into the floor, and a treasury with scattered gold coins. The corridors are 10 feet wide, and the central chamber is 40 feet in diameter. Entrance is through a heavy wooden door in the northwest corner, and a hidden exit is concealed behind a movable bookshelf in the library. Terrain includes cracked stone floors, patches of moss, and scattered rubble. Trap locations are marked by pressure plates in the corridors, and secret passages are indicated by faint cracks in the walls. Lighting is dim, with flickering torches mounted on the walls.**

Our sins ghosts (Part 2),HFY,1i9uxes,2025-01-25 14:32:32,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9uxes/our_sins_ghosts_part_2/,Arrowhead2009,OC,"[Part 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9aqfs/our_sins_ghosts/)

The High Council chamber, a grand, circular hall bathed in the golden glow of artificial sunlight, hummed with stoic authority. Seated at a raised dais, the councilors wore robes adorned with intricate patterns denoting their ranks and roles. A holographic star map rotated lazily at the center of the room, detailing Irepian-controlled systems.

The council's quiet deliberations were abruptly interrupted by a sharp, blaring alarm that echoed throughout the chamber. Red lights pulsed along the walls, and the holographic display shifted to an emergency alert.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Councilor Valtrix demanded, rising from his seat. Deep and commanding, his voice cut through the chaos like a blade.

A junior officer rushed into the chamber, his expression pale and frantic. “Councilors, we’ve detected a breach in Sector 72-Beta—a classified relic containment site. The stasis pod aboard the derelict Irepian vessel has been removed.”

The chamber erupted in whispers, councilors exchanging concerned and accusatory glances. Councilor Atriel, a sharp-eyed woman with cold precision, narrowed her gaze at the officer.

“Who would dare tamper with a restricted relic?” she asked, her tone icy. “And how did they bypass our monitoring protocols?”

The officer hesitated before responding. “The signature belongs to a reconnaissance vessel registered to Ostix Relvar, a operative of the Scientific Survey Corps. He was conducting an assessment in the region under Council orders.”

“Relvar?” Valtrix growled, his expression darkening. “That insubordinate wretch has been a thorn in our side for years. He must have discovered the relic by accident.”

“Accident or not, his actions jeopardize the security of the entire Irepian domain,” Atriel said sharply. She turned to the holographic map, which now displayed Ostix’s flight path. “We must assume the Hokris are involved. Their bioships have been active in the area.”

Valtrix slammed his hand on the table, reverberating through the chamber. “This is why we ordered the suppression of all records related to the ancient Drixpal! If their existence becomes widely known—”

Atriel raised a hand to silence him. “It’s too late to argue over past decisions. We need to focus on containment.”

Another councilor, younger and more reserved, leaned forward. “If Ostix has the Drixpal, we need to intercept him immediately. Recall his ship before the Hokris catch him—or worse, before he brings the relic here.”

Atriel’s sharp eyes flickered with annoyance. “Bringing the relic here isn’t an option. If the Hokris trace it back to us, we risk war on a scale we can’t control.”

Valtrix leaned forward, his voice a low growl. “Then what do you propose, Atriel?”

She glanced at the map, her lips curling into a grim line. “We dispatch a covert retrieval team. They’ll intercept Ostix and recover the pod before it can cause any further damage. If he resists... eliminate him.”

The room fell silent. Even Valtrix seemed taken aback by the severity of her proposal.

“You would sanction the execution of one of our own?” he asked.

“If it’s necessary to protect Irepian interests, yes,” Atriel replied hesitantly. “The survival of our civilization outweighs the life of a single rogue operative.”

The younger councilor hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. “I’ll prepare the retrieval team. But if we’re too late and the Hokris recover the relic—”

“They won’t,” Atriel interrupted, her tone final. “We’ll ensure they don’t.”

The holographic map zoomed in on Ostix’s trajectory, the faint trail of his FTL jump disappearing into uncharted space. The councilors exchanged uneasy glances as the chamber dimmed, the weight of their decision settling over them.

“Let us hope,” Atriel said softly, more to herself than the others, “that this mistake doesn’t awaken something far worse than the Hokris.”

Back aboard Ostix’s ship, the Drixpal’s stasis pod flickered faintly as the ancient systems continued to degrade. Ostix, oblivious to the chaos his actions had triggered in the High Council chamber, focused on stabilizing the pod’s power connections in the med bay.

“Helix, status report on the Drixpal,” Ostix asked, sweat beading on his forehead.

“The pod’s life support is holding, but it’s precarious,” Helix replied. “You’ve bought some time, but not much. If we don’t transfer them out soon—”

“Then we’ll lose them,” Ostix finished grimly. “I know.”

He glanced at the glowing figure within the pod. The Drixpal’s translucent blue skin shimmered faintly, its features serene yet alien. Ostix couldn’t help but feel a strange mix of awe and trepidation.

“Helix,” he said, his voice quieter now, “what do you think it will do if it wakes up?”

Helix paused before answering. “Assuming they’re not hostile? It will  either thank you—or curse you for pulling them into this mess.”

Ostix let out a dry chuckle. “Sounds about right. Let’s hope it’s the former.”

But as he worked, a proximity alarm blared. Helix’s tone turned urgent.

“Multiple ships inbound—unknown signatures. They’re not Hokris.”

Ostix’s heart sank. He knew precisely who they were.

“The High Council,” he muttered. “They’ve found us.”

the atmosphere had shifted from tense deliberation to calculated urgency in the High Council chamber. Councilor Atriel’s sharp voice pierced the hum of the emergency systems.

“Have the retrieval team been dispatched yet?” she demanded, her eyes fixed on the holographic display tracking Ostix’s last known position.

A young officer at a nearby console straightened. “Yes, Councilor. The team departed moments ago. Their intercept course will place them within range of Relvar’s ship in approximately twenty minutes.”

“Good,” Atriel said. “And the containment protocols?”

“Fully operational,” the officer confirmed. “If the Drixpal is revived before extraction, the retrieval team is authorized to neutralize it.”

This drew murmurs of dissent among the councilors. Councilor Valtrix’s booming voice silenced them.

“Neutralize the Drixpal?” he growled. “Do you know what kind of weaponized knowledge we could lose?”

Atriel’s icy gaze locked onto him. “And what if that knowledge turns against us? The Drixpal have no love for Irepian-kind. If this being awakens with hostile intentions, the consequences could be catastrophic.”

“We’ve survived worse threats,” Valtrix shot back, his fists clenched.

“No, we’ve survived because we’ve suppressed those threats,” Atriel countered. “The relic containment sites exist for a reason, Councilor.”

A third councilor, an older man with tired eyes, raised a hand. “Enough. This debate is irrelevant if the Hokris recover the Drixpal first. Atriel’s retrieval plan is our best course for now.”

Atriel inclined her head, but her gaze lingered on Valtrix. The older councilor glared back before settling into his seat with a dissatisfied grunt.

The holographic display zoomed in, showing the faint trail left by Ostix’s ship. One of the junior officers spoke hesitantly. “Councilors, there’s an anomaly in the FTL wake from Relvar’s ship.”

“What kind of anomaly?” Atriel demanded.

“It’s faint, but it appears to be a secondary signal,” the officer said. “Encrypted, ancient in origin... similar to the one emitted by the probe.”

The councilors exchanged uneasy glances. Atriel’s sharp mind processed the implications quickly.

“The Drixpal’s pod is transmitting again,” she said. “If the Hokris intercept that signal, they’ll abandon their pursuit of the decoy.”

Valtrix leaned forward, his expression grim. “And come straight for Ostix.”

Atriel turned back to the officer. “Can we jam the signal remotely?”

“Negative,” the officer replied, his tone regretful. “The encryption predates all known override protocols. We’d need direct access to the pod’s systems.”

Atriel’s hands tightened on the edge of the table. “Then the retrieval team has even less time than we thought. Inform them of the signal and instruct them to expedite their mission.”

The older councilor spoke again, his voice heavy with foreboding. “And if the Hokris reach the Drixpal first?”

Atriel didn’t answer immediately. The silence in the chamber stretched uncomfortably until she finally spoke, her tone cold and final.

“Then we’ll have no choice but to destroy the entire sector.”

The room fell silent, the weight of her words settling over them like a shroud. Even Valtrix, ever the contrarian, didn’t protest. The councilors understood the stakes—if the Hokris acquired the Drixpal, it could tip the delicate balance of power in the galaxy. And the Irepian High Council wasn’t prepared to let that happen.

Meanwhile, aboard Ostix’s ship, the proximity alarm grew louder. Helix’s synthetic voice broke through the cacophony.

“Three ships inbound—two from the High Council’s retrieval team and one... unknown. It doesn’t match any Irepian or Hokris designs.”

Ostix’s heart skipped a beat. “Unknown? Could it be—”

“Unlikely,” Helix cut in. “The Hokris bioship is still pursuing the decoy. This is something else entirely.”

Ostix cursed under his breath. “How far out are they?”

“Council ships: six minutes. Unknown vessel: three,” Helix reported. “And judging by their trajectories, they’re all converging on us.”

Ostix glanced at the Drixpal’s pod, its faint glow pulsing steadily. The encrypted signal had to be the reason for all this chaos. His mind raced as he tried to formulate a plan.

“Helix, can we block the signal locally?” he asked, his voice tight.

“I can try to suppress it,” Helix replied. “But the encryption is ancient and layered. I’ll need time.”

“Then you’d better work fast,” Ostix said. “Because if they catch us, we’re out of options.”

As Helix began its work, Ostix prepared for the inevitable confrontation. His ship wasn’t built for combat, but he had one advantage: the asteroid field surrounding the derelict vessel. It was a treacherous maze of debris, perfect for evading pursuers—if he could outmaneuver them.

“Helix, plot a course through the asteroid field,” Ostix ordered. “We’ll make it as hard as possible for them to reach us.”

“And if they catch up?” Helix asked.

Ostix glanced at the Drixpal, the faint glow reflecting in his visor. “Then we hope this relic is worth the trouble.”"

La vera ricchezza del futuro sarà la sanità mentale?,CasualIT,1i9ttho,2025-01-25 13:45:03,6,0.75,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIT/comments/1i9ttho/la_vera_ricchezza_del_futuro_sarà_la_sanità/,Quillish98,Post SERIO,"Credo che ciò che renderà veramente ricche le persone nel vicino futuro sarà, più che il denaro, più che il lavoro, più che le rendite la pura e semplice sanità mentale.

È un pensiero a cui sono arrivato dopo aver letto pareri di psicologi, sociologi, economisti e averne parlato con quelle poche persone straordinarie che reputo miei amici.

Mi spiego meglio.

La rivoluzione industriale ha portato un benessere diffuso e una sicurezza mai viste prima d'ora. Certo, c'è chi è più ricco e chi è più povero, chi ha una macchina e chi no, ma tutti noi abbiamo un tetto sopra la testa, due pasti caldi al giorno e un letto in cui dormire.

A meno di non fare scelte VERAMENTE DISTRUTTIVE nei confronti della propria persona, chiunque nei paesi sviluppati ha accesso all'acqua corrente, alle cure di base, a un minimo di protezione ed è immune da malattie che fino a un secolo fa' falcidiavano milioni di anime.

Per dio, anche nel peggiore dei casi in cui non si abbia veramente niente la nostra società è così stabile e forte da fornire vitto e alloggio gratuitamente a chi ne ha bisogno per davvero (nella forma di Caritas e case popolari), lussi che fino a pochi secoli fa erano appannaggio solo dei più ricchi tra i re.

Il sistema capitalista è TALMENTE EFFICACE nel garantire benessere diffuso che non ci accontentiamo più del fondamentale per vivere bene ma cerchiamo il meglio sul mercato. Motivo per cui chi ha la Smart odia chi ha la Ferrari, quando entrambe le auto ti portano da A a B in tempi astronomicamente più veloci che a piedi, o chi ha il monolocale odia chi ha il trilocale, senza considerare che in entrambe le case puoi vivere, dormire, cucinare e defecare senza dover fare chilometri a piedi come avviene nelle regioni più povere dell'Africa.

Ecco quindi che la VERA risorsa scarseggiante, il vero bene prezioso più che il denaro è la sanità mentale, il raziocinio, la capacità di comprendere la realtà nella sua oggettività e di prendere decisioni basate sui fatti.

La società del benessere ha portato con sé anche una polarizzazione mai vista prima d'ora. Chi fino a pochi decenni fa sarebbe morto a seguito della sua pazzia (pretendendo risorse senza dare nulla in cambio, distruggendo volontariamente il suo corpo, sperperando i propri beni ecc) ora non solo può sopravvivere senza problemi ma può diffondere la sua follia anche verso chi lo circonda.

I sindacalisti ultra 50enni che scioperano in piazza senza chiedersi minimamente il motivo per cui sono arrivati alla pensione senza risparmiare un centesimo? Questa è follia 

L* femminist* (voglio essere gender neutral) che passa il suo tempo a contestare le politiche di genere invece di studiare un mestiere che può essere utile e portargli un guadagno? Anche questa è follia 

L'* ambientalist* che passa pomeriggi interi ad elemosinare firme dai passanti per ""fermare la lotta alle balene"" anziché studiare qualcosa che permetta CONCRETAMENTE di fermare la lotta alle balene? Sempre follia

La sanità mentale dà qualcosa che questa gente non ha e non avrà mai: il PERCHÉ le cose stanno come stanno.

Sai PERCHÉ guadagni di più o di meno di altri, sai PERCHÉ sei sovrappeso, normopeso o sottopeso, sai PERCHÉ la tua pelle è bianca piuttosto che nera. 

Cristo, se decidessi di rovinarti il fegato al bar e finire in coma etilico su un letto di ospedale sai PERCHÉ ci sei finito.

Questa gente no. Questa gente vaga nella vita senza meta, tormentata dalla propria follia, soffrendo la scissione tra la propria realtà e la fattuale, oggettiva, empirica realtà delle cose.

E deve essere terrificante vivere un'esistenza del genere

Ecco perché la sanità mentale è così preziosa:

La sanità mentale ti permette di vedere la realtà così come è, incassare le botte che la vita ti dà, ragionare sulla base di ciò che funziona per davvero e agire di conseguenza.

La sanità mentale ti dà dei punti di riferimento veri, oggettivi, fattuali a cui poter sempre tornare.

La sanità mentale, al di là delle preferenze, degli interessi e dei gusti personali ti permette di vedere le cose per come sono realmente, indipendentemente dalle azioni che prenderai.

Ecco perché nel futuro la vera ricchezza, il vero benessere sarà la sanità mentale "

Ne aveva quasi la certezza, perché ogni volta che quelli si affacciavano per gettargli un tozzo di pane e una borraccia sporca lui ne approfittava: alzava lo sguardo. Così poteva intravedere, a quaranta pietroni di altezza, un’apertura circolare, un cerchio di luce bianchissimo che, soprattutto quando il sole era allo zenit, rendeva ancor più nera la sagoma dei suoi sequestratori. Sì, doveva essere un pozzo. Nessun'altra opzione gli era parsa plausibile, lì sotto, nell'oscurità narcotica in cui lo costringevano a deperire.

Nel fondo del cilindro abissale in cui si trovava, il buio era tale che perfino i volti dei suoi rapitori, lontani e torbidi, assumevano una parvenza di lucore e intelligibilità quando estraevano il coperchio due volte al giorno. Due volte ogni giorno. Ogni giorno uguale. La prima volta sollevavano la copertura per assicurarsi che fosse ancora vivo; la seconda, invece, per lasciar cadere qualche crosta di pane e un po’ d’acqua. Il pane era raffermo, pochissima mollica. L’acqua, contenuta in una fiaschetta, veniva calata lentamente mediante una corda legata al collo della bottiglia, in modo da consentire al primo carceriere di ritirarla a sé prima che il secondo richiudesse il pozzo. E che tornasse il buio, e il silenzio, dalla cui muta risacca si avvertono i cigolii della Terra. E lo sferragliare dei fotoni, e gli atomi spremuti dalle dita aggranchite. Era un’acqua dal sapore acre, ma doveva farsela andare giù.

Gli aguzzini erano sempre in due; non gli rivolgevano una parola e nemmeno dialogavano tra di loro; non un bisbiglio, non un pettegolezzo. Mai la grazia di insultarlo, compatirlo o - perlomeno - deriderlo.  Il prigioniero non capiva se la coppia che vedeva presentarsi quotidianamente alla soglia del pozzo fosse formata dagli stessi due uomini o se si alternassero, in quattro, in sei, in otto, per una sorta di sistema a turni orchestrato già prima di attuare il sequestro. E dato che le sagome non rispondevano, il prigioniero parlava da solo. La maggior parte del tempo lo trascorreva a speculare, bofonchiando ipotesi che in uno schiocco di dita si sgretolavano. No, non aveva nemici degni di chiamarsi tali, e no, la famiglia non vantava ricchezze così cospicue da suscitare invidie. I suoi erano ragionamenti inconcludenti, fantasticherie, ma doveva pur far qualcosa per ignorare la sofferenza di un corpo smagrito che strideva di dolore. Amorfi schiamazzi.

Un giorno - chissà quanto tempo era passato dall’inizio della cattività - il sole irradiò la sua pelle emaciata non due volte, come era ormai spietata consuetudine, ma tre. Socchiuse le palpebre per schermare le iridi dallo scintillio di luce che si era scagliato come una saetta e le riaprì appena il bruciore agli occhi si fu attenuato. Guardò in alto. Non c’erano le due ombre che si aspettava di scorgere. Era solo il contorno di una persona, questa terza volta, a sporgersi. Poi ecco, all’improvviso, dalla sagoma nera spuntò un prolungamento sfocato, altrettanto nero ma più fine, che doveva essere il braccio, e all’estremità dell’arto un rigonfiamento irregolare, senz’altro la mano, che si aprì e lasciò cadere un oggetto, affidando alla forza di gravità il compito di concludere la staffetta. Non era un gesto caritatevole, o una doppia razione di pane. Si trattava di una lettera. Cadde così piano - ondeggiava nell’aria come una bolla di sapone, a un ritmo calmo, lento come un crepuscolo estivo - che non appena il reietto riuscì ad agguantarla il pozzo era già stato richiuso.

Si esaltò all'idea di poter comunicare con una persona reale dopo tanto tempo, sebbene quel contesto non lasciasse certo presagire un carteggio con possibilità di replica. Iniziò a scartarla. Allo schiudersi della busta sentì le sue dita tremare e il suo corpo intero fu succube di un brivido ascendente che innalzandosi dalle piante dei piedi prese possesso di tutta la sua denutrita carne fino a scuotere collo e testa. La speranza quasi lo indusse a piangere perché, forse, poteva essere prossimo alla liberazione e qualcuno aveva pensato di comunicarglielo per iscritto. Aveva la lettera aperta tra le mani. *No, no, no*. Cosa aspettava a leggerla? Perché esitava? Le sue mani lasciarono la presa. *No, no, no*. Il foglio cadde. *Che babbeo*, disse tra sé e sé. Non aveva pensato alla più banale delle ovvietà, al fatto che, sotto quella luce inesistente, non avrebbe potuto cogliere una sola virgola di quella lettera. L’ottimismo e la speranza, infidi incantesimi, lo avevano distolto dalla barriera di buio che si interponeva tra il proprio desiderio di informazioni e le informazioni stesse.

Nei minuti e nelle ore seguenti si sforzò di non chiudere occhio. Lo fece con metodo: in vita sua gli era accaduto diverse volte di trovarsi in un'oscurità tale da convincersi che non sarebbe riuscito a veder nulla, eppure, col tempo, nonostante la caligine, nonostante l'assenza di sole e luna, gradualmente ogni cosa prima o poi cedeva e infine si rivelava; era una rivelazione distorta, certo, e il prigioniero lo sapeva bene, che sotto il manto della notte le cose non erano mai davvero sé stesse fino in fondo. Lo intuiva già da bambino: ogni volta che la realtà si ritrovava cosparsa col liquido della notte, lui pensava che il mondo apparisse come ridisegnato, alterato da una grafite magica, una sfumatura estranea ma non troppo: il tanto che bastava allo sguardo per non trasalire nell’ignoto e poter comunque indovinare, nel nero segreto della propria casa, le consuete linee delle stanze, le solite sagome dei mobili, i contorni rassicuranti del letto. Così, ragionò, allo stesso modo doveva accadere anche in quel bugigattolo sotterraneo dove ora stava rinchiuso che le sue pupille si sarebbero prima o poi addomesticate alla totale vacuità per poi procedere a captare i suggerimenti delle cose circostanti, ramoscelli, escrementi, sino a poter distinguere finalmente le frasi scritte in quel foglio. Ma i suoi calcoli, indubbiamente giusti e arguti, non potevano immaginare quanto inossidabile fosse l’oscurità che impregnava quel cilindro abissale. Nelle ore successive i suoi occhi non sarebbero riusciti a carpire un solo concetto d’inchiostro. Ogni cosa, familiare o estranea, sottraeva la propria familiarità e la propria estraneità. L’approssimazione era bandita. Inoltre, il buio non era l’unico impedimento. Non sazia, la sorte gli fu infatti avversa, per assurdo e ingiusto gioco della natura, perfino in condizioni di luce, quando, il giorno seguente, alla prima apertura del pozzo, i suoi occhi arrugginiti e lenti si ritrovarono incapaci di star dietro alla luminosità brusca e repentina: troppo esiguo era il tempo necessario ai due uomini per capire se fosse vivo o morto: bastava un movimento della testa del prigioniero e loro richiudevano immediatamente, senza che lo sventurato potesse adattarsi alle nuove condizioni di chiarezza. Allora non gli rimaneva altro da fare che conservare ogni energia per la seconda apertura, per il secondo cerchio di luce.

Trascorse quella che gli era sembrata un’eternità, finché finalmente il fascio abbagliante si scaraventò di nuovo sulla sua pelle. Sentì il pane indurito rimbalzare tra le pareti e vide un puntino nero, la borraccia, scendere lentamente, sempre sostenuto dalla corda. La luce era ottimale. Afferrò il pane, lo posò sul grembo. Iniziò a leggere il messaggio quando ancora la fiaschetta non aveva raggiunto la sua altezza. I suoi occhi riconobbero la grafia di una persona conosciuta.

>*Caro Ludwig, stiamo negoziando con i tuoi sequestratori. Chiedono una quantità di denaro che noi, stando così le cose, non possiamo permetterci. Siamo disperati, e immagino che anche tu lo sia. Per piacere, cerca di sopravvivere. Non provocare in alcun modo le persone che ti tengono in ostaggio. Noi faremo il…*

>

Tornò il buio. Il povero prigioniero si adirò, si dimenò. E urlò, come già aveva urlato, invano, i primi giorni di detenzione. Avrebbe dovuto aspettare altre venti ore, al meno, per proseguire nella lettura. E aspettò, ricurvo, immobile, intorpidito, ogni tanto in piedi, per sgranchirsi, per fingere di passeggiare all’aperto, inebriato da una brezza leggera, tra chiome di faggi e cortecce di castagni, e poi di nuovo catapultato nella foschia impenetrabile, rannicchiato, con gli zigomi scavati e le clavicole sporgenti, schiacciato in un sonno spossante.

Stava ancora in posizione fetale quando la luce lo schiaffeggiò il giorno successivo. Doveva affrettarsi. Premette le palpebre e cercò la lettera. Dov’era? Setacciò in lungo e in largo ma nel marasma indefinito di residui corporei e rifiuti irriconoscibili non riuscì a trovarla. Si agitò, implorò tempo ai due uomini senza volto e, dopo qualche istante di frenesia, la riconobbe al tatto. La portò accanto agli occhi, ma fu buio.

Era assorto. La bocca spalancata. Esausto. Da quando era arrivata la lettera, una forza vitale aveva cominciato a pulsare nelle sue vene. Si trattava di un’energia bilama. Da una parte era propizia, indispensabile per quei frangenti in cui doveva prodigarsi per leggere la missiva; dall’altra parte era logorante, perché in quel luogo angusto e solitario, se non c’era altro con cui affaccendarsi - e non c’era, altro -, quell’energia non sapeva più dove scorrere e pertanto rimaneva ingorgata all’interno, chiusa nel suo isolato corpo che, come un mulino, sfruttava le correnti interne per macinargli l’anima in polveri di pensieri.

Aprirono una seconda volta per gettargli il cibo, caddero briciole di luce sulle sue vesti consunte, la borraccia iniziò a discendere, l’uomo riprese a leggere:

>*… faremo il possibile per farti uscire da lì. Abbiamo comunicato alle guardie quanto accaduto, tuttavia ci hanno detto che dobbiamo aspettare, e che non possiamo nemmeno scriverti tutto ciò che vorremmo, poiché i tuoi rapitori potrebbero, ovviamente, estrapolare informazioni preziose da questa lettera. Riguardati. Un forte abbraccio. La tua cara mamma.*

Il disgraziato incurvò ulteriormente il suo broncio in una smorfia imperlata di lacrime. Già dalla prima parte della lettera aveva presentito che il messaggio non avrebbe portato a nulla. Dopo aver trangugiato il pane afferrò la fiaschetta, che quasi rischiava di tornare piena tra le mani dei due uomini umbratili, e bevette ogni singola goccia d’acqua per reidratare le sue secche fauci. Si adagiò sul giaciglio di sporcizia. Sentì il pavimento vibrare. La Terra cigolava, facendo tremare le profondità. L’uomo cadde in un sonno di piombo.

Il giorno successivo i fasci luminosi furono nuovamente tre e al terzo cerchio di luce seguì una lettera che, lievemente, si poggiò su quelle frasche acuminate che l’ostaggio usava come cuscino. Riuscì a leggerla in due giornate, sempre scandite dalle luci avare che dettavano la durata della sua prigionia.

>*Ludwig, qualcosa inizia a smuoversi, resisti. Tuo padre ha chiesto aiuto a un suo vecchio compagno d’arme, Wilfred, che ha fatto fortuna con il commercio di pelli di visone, e pare che gli presterà parte della somma richiesta dai tuoi rapitori, somma che, purtroppo, aumenta col passare del tempo. Le guardie dicono che non possono far nulla, perché non hanno nessuna traccia. Tua moglie Susan è venuta a vivere da noi poiché lei e il piccolo Robert non hanno di che mangiare. Stanno un po’ meglio rispetto ai primi giorni, e cercano di andare avanti, perché il mondo va avanti. Se sei vivo, se leggi le nostre parole, per piacere… non lasciarti andare. Un abbraccio, mamma.*

Buio, cerchi di luce, buio, cerchi di luce, pane e acqua, buio: così fino alla terza missiva, letta tra gli stillicidi di luce in un arco di giorni ormai confusi, inafferrabili.

>*Ludwig. Mi dispiace. Ho rivelato troppo. In quale fatale errore sono caduta per la smania di darti speranza, figlio mio! Wilfred è stato ucciso nella sua stessa casa. Sono entrati e hanno messo tutto a soqquadro, lo hanno legato a una sedia e gli hanno puntato un coltello alla gola, minacciandolo. Lui ha dato loro fino all’ultima banconota, sperando che ciò sarebbe bastato a risparmiargli la vita. Possedeva dei risparmi in banca, certamente, ma come potrai ben capire, adesso la sua famiglia ha ben altro a cui pensare, così dovremo trovare un altro modo… Se c’è, un altro modo. Con dolore, ti saluto, tua madre.*

Si lasciò andare a terra come una carcassa esanime. Digrignava, per il dolore che trafiggeva il suo cuore già precario.

Passò molto tempo prima che una nuova giornata con tre cerchi di luce arrivasse. Il pover’uomo non aveva più le forze di alzarsi, e nemmeno fantasticava più immaginandosi tra faggi e castagni. Quelle poche energie date dalla speranza si erano dissolte, e di lui non rimaneva che un barlume acquoso nelle iridi, mentre tutto il corpo andava rinsecchendosi in un ammasso di ossicini e muscoli rattrappiti. Una notte - sì, doveva essere di notte - aveva provato nuovamente ad arrampicarsi, replicando l’inutile tentativo di fuga del suo primo giorno, ma non c’erano fenditure o appigli abbastanza sporgenti affinché le sue esili dita potessero aggrapparcisi, e tantomeno le sue gambe ne volevano sapere di concedergli gli slanci necessari per ottenere l’efficacia di un salto vigoroso.

Gli erano caduti dei denti. A ogni movimento delle sue caviglie qualche molare veniva strascicato sul terriccio polveroso, sballottato dai colpetti involontari dei suoi smunti piedi. Non gli importava granché di masticare quel pane raffermo che ogni tanto scivolava sui suoi abiti sgualciti e, in quelle rare occasioni in cui ne malassava la crosta con la lingua, si limitava a sbatacchiare quei pochi denti rimasti come per l’abbrivo di un automatismo recondito, un’inestirpabile usanza animale.

Era ormai una creatura dimenticata e desiderava, più della libertà stessa, l’abbraccio caldo di una persona, di un essere umano come lui, o perlomeno simile a lui, non necessariamente della stessa specie, figurarsi: si sarebbe fatto bastare un esemplare del suo genere, un Homo qualunque, un Homo con cui poter parlare, con gesti e grugniti, di quanto orribili fossero quelle profondità. Ben presto, però, iniziò a rimproverarsi per quelle pretese. Ne concluse che poteva senz’altro accontentarsi di una bestia. Dinanzi a tale compagnia avrebbe mostrato infinita riconoscenza. Disse: Dio, qualunque cosa. Si addormentò con le mani congiunte.

Sognò un cranio disseppellito, marcio, disposto al centro del pozzo. Trasalì nel vedere due orbite vuote nel punto in cui era solito incrociare due pupille lucenti. Si avvicinò alle cavità del teschio e domandò se lì dentro per caso vi fosse Dio. Non ottenne risposta. Vi infilò le dita e sentì l’umidità del terriccio incastonata tra le placche del cranio. Poi ritrasse il braccio con impeto, terrorizzato, poiché aveva avvertito qualcosa di simile a una lingua. Una voce allora gli parlò; ma all’uomo parve che la frase fosse incompleta. *Ripeti, per piacere!*, gridò nell’affanno. Il teschio cadde con violenza e rotolò all’indietro. Il prigioniero cercò di raccoglierlo ma non riuscì a muoversi; sgomitava a vuoto, sospeso e immobile, come trattenuto da una rete invisibile e viscosa.

Se solo il suo corpo avesse avuto acqua e forze necessarie da disperdere in fisiologiche velleità, quel mattino si sarebbe svegliato madido di sudore e in preda ai tremori. Cercò di riassemblare i frammenti del sogno, sforzandosi di mettere d’accordo quella parte di sé che aveva vissuto il sogno con quella che l’aveva creato tenendo conto di quella che ora cercava di ricordarlo. Consapevole che l’avrebbe dimenticata di lì a poco, convenne che la frase fosse più o meno questa:

*“All’uscita smettono di domandare il perché dell’ingresso”.*

E si scordò tutto, poiché ogni rimembranza sostava e vorticava solo pochi istanti. Una permanenza schiva, di ricordi subito scacciati dai lamenti della carne.

Per quanto ormai non gli interessasse più, quella sua supposizione sull’adattabilità dello sguardo, che all’inizio non aveva mostrato i risultati sperati, si era infine rivelata fondata: i suoi occhi erano ormai in grado di intravedere nell’oscurità le cose circostanti, e ogni sordida schifezza che riempiva il fondo di quel baratro era pressoché nitida. Quando la sua vista fu talmente sviluppata da poter discernere nel buio la differenza tra una foglia e l’altra, a un terzo cerchio di luce arrivò una nuova lettera e, a quel punto, per leggerla non gli servì aspettare che i due uomini scoperchiassero il pozzo, anzi, ripudiava la luce, la aborriva, quasi ci abbaiava contro, e si chiudeva a riccio per evitare che neanche un singolo raggio lambisse i suoi occhi cavernosi.

>*Oggi sono andata al mercato e ho comprato della verdura al banco di Edmund. Aveva dei cavoli così freschi che lasciarglieli sarebbe stato un peccato. Gli ho pure chiesto uno sconto, e per nostra fortuna me l’ha concesso. Ho incontrato la signora Rosmett, perfida lingua lunga che non è altra! Sempre a vantarsi di suo marito e del figlio. Mio figlio di qua, mio figlio di là… Insopportabile. Domani andrò dal parrucchiere. In questi giorni c’è bel tempo, anche se non dovremmo esultare per il sole, perché ai campi serve acqua. Tuo padre a breve festeggerà i suoi cinquantacinque anni, che fai, vieni o rimani in quel pozzo? Saluti, tua madre.* 

Ludwig accartocciò la lettera e la gettò lontano, per quanto il mezzo metro di distanza tra il suo pugno e la parete potesse definirsi lontano.

A un nuovo terzo cerchio di luce - chissà quanti giorni, mesi, anni dopo -, la quinta lettera cadde senza che lui nemmeno se ne accorse. La notò solo in un secondo momento, poiché il candore ancora bianco della carta, contrastata dal grigiore decadente che le faceva da sfondo, risaltava fino ad attirare l’attenzione persino dell’occhio più svogliato e assente.

>*Certo che potresti rispondere. Te ne stai sempre lì sotto! Ti costa tanto chiedere ai rapitori di darti un foglio e una penna? Ci hanno mandato una foto per dimostrarci che sei ancora vivo. Hai sempre il muso, dovresti sorridere. Il mondo va avanti, Ludwig, devi andare avanti. E tuo figlio Robert… Se vuoi che abbia un futuro, devi lavorare, il college non si pagherà da solo. Hai delle responsabilità. Devi adempiere ai tuoi doveri. Il figlio della signora Rosmett ha finito la gavetta in fabbrica e adesso ha un contratto a tempo indeterminato, mentre Edmund Junior è stato assunto alla dogana: lavora per lo stato, e mica è poco. Comunque, i sequestratori chiedono sempre più soldi. Di grazia, cerca di racimolare anche tu qualche spicciolo, altrimenti non potremo mai raggiungere la quota, che diamine!*

Doveva essere la fine dell’estate. Gli uomini ignoti ormai non passavano più da tempo immemore. Il coperchio del pozzo era talmente consumato dalle intemperie che la sua apertura circolare, quasi del tutto sguarnita, permetteva ai baluginii lunari e alle piogge sabbiose di insinuarsi nel cilindro abissale. Addirittura qualche asse di legno era caduta in profondità, dove Ludwig, oramai ridotto a una secca spiga di grano, stava esalando i suoi ultimi respiri. Non si sentiva alcun rumore se non il lamento metallico della Terra, i cui cardini stridevano per gli immani spostamenti. Quando vide la Morte, che si calava lentamente nel pozzo per defalcarlo dalla vita, non aveva ancora finito di leggere la sesta lettera.

>*Di recente è stato rapito anche il figlio della signora Rosmett. Il loro fondo risparmi gli ha comunque consentito di pagare istantaneamente tutta la somma richiesta dai delinquenti. Subito è stato liberato e ora, baldanzoso, racconta ai più curiosi le sue avventure. Che coraggio, dovresti vederlo, in men che non si dica è tornato in fabbrica! Ludwig, noi non ce la facciamo più, così. Che senso ha chiamarti “figlio” se non ti vediamo da così tanti anni? Non comunichi mai, non rispondi alle nostre lettere, non ti confidi… Pensi solo a te stesso. Sei un egoista, Ludwig, ci hai abbandonati. Ti sei perso la festa di diploma di Robert. Sei sempre lì sotto, non è così? Quanta crudeltà, da parte tua! Che noncuranza! Per quel che ne sappiamo, potresti anche essertelo inventato, questo rapimento. E se anche fosse vero, è chiaro che ti sei impigrito, lì sotto. Tuo padre, da sempre tenace e combattivo, non si capacita di aver avuto un figlio così arrendevole. Non fai nulla per uscirne, e noi di certo non abbiamo tutti i soldi per il riscatto, anche perché, ogni volta che ci scrivono, chiedono più denaro.  Una relazione è fatta di compromessi, Ludwig, noi ti abbiamo dato tutto, ti abbiamo cresciuto senza mai farti mancare nulla. Cosa stai dando tu a noi? Dov’eri, per il sessantesimo di tuo padre? Tua moglie Susan è andata a vivere in città insieme a Edmund Junior, così Robert potrà andare al College. Non riusciva più a sopportare la sua solitudine, a tollerare la tua assenza. E noi la pensiamo allo stesso modo. Un sequestro non può giustificare ogni cosa.* *Abbiamo deciso di vendere le tue cose. Buona f-.*

La Morte, leggiadra, raccolse la spiga e risalì il lungo pozzo di pietra. 

Una volta fuori, con cautela, ripose la spiga in tasca e, infine, si sedette sotto un grande eucalipto, al confine con un terreno spoglio e arato, in attesa dell’autunno."

Bună seara, rodditori, sper că vă bucurați de un weekend prelungit plin de relaxare și Netflix, că doar nu o să ne apucăm acum de activități productive.

Vorbeam zilele trecute cu niște prieteni care au casă din 2019 (da, genul ăla de oameni care au făcut alegerile corecte în viață), și brusc m-a lovit o revelație: fac 29 de ani anul ăsta, și în afară de un credit la telefon și un contract de chirie n-am nimic pe numele meu.

Eu și prietenul meu avem ceva bani strânși, dar nu cât să ne permitem un avans la un apartament în București, că, na, viața e scumpă și dai 100 de lei la Mega pe 3 chestii. 
Simt că, pentru câțiva ani buni, ar trebui să ne închidem puțin orizonturile ca să strângem suficienți bani pentru avans. 

Dacă mă întrebai acum câțiva ani, eram convinsă că la 30 o să am casă, copil și poate un câine care nu roade mobila. Acum îmi dau seama că visul meu de adult responsabil a fost complet sabotat de realitatea din România. 

Problema e că nu am nici părinți care să mă „sponsorizeze”, cum văd că au făcut mulți dintre prietenii noștri. 

Așa că, întrebarea mea pentru voi este: e doar în capul meu? Ar trebui să accept realitatea și să îmbrățișez ideea că voi mai sta în chirie ceva ani buni, chiar dacă îmi rupe toate planurile de viață? Voi cum faceți față acestei realități, în care versiunea de 10 ani a voastră v-ar întreba „Ce-ai făcut cu viața ta?!” și voi i-ați răspunde „Am plătit chirie și am mâncat sushi de la Glovo”?

Hai, spuneți-mi că nu-s singura care simte că adulting-ul ăsta e un scam.

A giorni lo farò castrare ma il signorino ha già causato parecchi danni perché morde e graffia le altre! Una ci ha quasi lasciato l'occhio e poi ha morso il bambino in casa sul naso. Purtroppo a causa del fatto che io vivo in due case il gatto si comporta ""bene"" solo quando ci sono io. Non so che fare. Spero che con la castrazione si tranquilizzi un po' ma avete altri consigli da darmi? Per motivi personali ancora non me la sento di andare a convivere e poi se ogni volta che vado in ferie (non vengono lasciati soli) succedono questi incidenti per la mia assenza l'unica scelta é di darlo via ma ci sono legata e quella é l'ultimissimissima spiaggia.

Deficitul Romaniei sau unde se sifoneaza banii nostrii inclusiv al studentilor,UniRO,1i9qb0m,2025-01-25 11:12:28,10,0.78,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniRO/comments/1i9qb0m/deficitul_romaniei_sau_unde_se_sifoneaza_banii/,gayroma,Discuție,"Hai sa vorbesc prima oara de CFR si apoi de situatia globala. Deci pe 2024 intr-adevar CFR a avut pierderi semnificative de valoare in jurul a mimim 120 mil de euro (600 mil lei) dintr-un buget total de 5.8 miliarde de lei si realist probabil dublu pierderi in jurul a 1 miliard de lei. DAR. Majoritatea acestor pierderi vin din faptul ca in 2024 nu stiu daca stiati dar s-au marit toate salariile din CFR cu 36% ! pana la in jur de 3 miliarde de lei numai cheltuieli cu salarii deci in jur de 50%. Un procent extrem de mare si pur si simplu nefezabil intr-o economie de piata, nu poti sa dai salarii atat de mari si sa fii si performant. 

Deci CFR a primit salarii mari iar rezultatele lor si in 2024 ca si in anii precedenti AU FOST VARZA! si vina nu a fost numai a infrastructurii (de care tot ei sunt responsabili ei adica CFR) cu multiple probleme. Dar angajatii CFR se comporta ca la stat, NU LE PASA, si asta vezi cand mergi prin alte tari din EU (cel mai aproape in Ungaria sa compari).

In loc sa taie in carne vie din salarii si sa lase beneficiile pentru studenti, statul a taiat beneficiile pentru studenti. Pierderile CFR nu sunt apropo numai din cauza studentilor ci pentru ca efectiv tot sistemul CFR este extrem de neperformant in principal intarzierea trenurilor, cat faci pe traseu (gen 50 de km in doua ore), calitatea trenurilor (curatenie, wc-uri...), respectarea regulilor in tren, pretul biletelor raportat la ce ofera...

Pur si simplu multe rute de tren au devenit neperformante si au ajuns sa mearga cu trenul cam cei care au gratuitati de tot felul ceea ce automat normal duce la mai mare neperformanta. De la an la an pe multe rute vin mai putini calatori. Si atunci in loc sa optimizeze sistemul ei inchid rutele ceea ce face mai neatractiv mersul cu trenul avand mai putine optiuni. 

gratuitatile studentilor asa este contribuie (au contribuit) si ele la pierderi dar semnificativ mai putin decat salariile ceferistilor care pur si simplu sunt nemeritate incepand cu conducerea CFR si terminand cu angajatii miserupisti. Iar problema ramane a lor a CFR-ului, care an de la an a ajuns aici, demonstrand ce poate face o companie de stat din Romania. 

Si acum postarea mea initiala 

In 2024 deficitul Romaniei a fost de 7.1% din PIB!!! adica 125.7 miliarde de lei in jur de 25 de MILIARDE de EURO! 25 de miliarde atat a furat guvernul Romaniei condus de PSD PNL si acum si de UDMR.  
148 de miliarde sunt doar cheltuieli pe salarii adica pe salariile statului s-a cheltuit mai mult decat deficitul imens Romaniei. Asistenta sociala este la 205.3 miliarde.  
Totusi asistenta sociala implica toti romanii iar statul ar trebui sa fie cat mai eficient.  
Aproape 30 de miliarde de EURO cheltuim noi pe stat. Cu atat ne sifoneaza.

La aprox 1.5 milioane de angajati total la stat in TOATE TOATE structurile asta inseamna 20000 EURO pe an per angajat. Poate ca nu pare mult asa la prima impresie o cheltuiala de aproape 1700 de euro pe luna per angajat dar avand in vedere ineficienta majoritatii salariatilor (si a catorva pensii speciale imense care duc statistica in sus) si raportat la salariul mediu in Romania (care este de asemenea tras in sus de catre salariile mari) care este 1000 de euro, inseamna ca la stat per total si-au dat salarii cu 70% mai mult decat in economie. Not good. Se lafaie pe banii nostrii si isi dau salarii mai mari per total ca in economie.

Ca sa reduca deficitul trebuie sa reduca si salariile pe langa numarul de salariati.  
Ca sa reduca cu 10% cheltuielile pe salarii trebuie ori sa dea 10% din angajati (150.000 de oameni deci un numar consistent) ori sa reduca cu 10% salariile (mai ales la pensiile speciale care trag in sus salariile) ori o combinatie. Iar taieri de cheltuieli de 10% nu va scadea deficitul decat cu 14.8 miliarde ceea ce e in jur de 10% din totalul deficitului.

La asistenta sociala la fel au taiat la greu in tot felul de moduri. Asta e rau pentru ca afecteaza cel mai mult saracii din Romania (nu spun ca unele asistente sociale nu trebuie taiate, gen pe la sate oameni tineri care refuza) totusi in Romania pur asistati sociali sunt in jur de 170.000 de persoane carora li se da 400 de lei pe luna, maxim 1000 de euro pe an cu totul, deci in jur de 170.000.000 milioane de euro.

Mai sunt bineinteles MULTE alte forme de asistenta sociala de ex pentru studenti, pentru elevi alocatia, hrana unde li se da...

Asistenta sociala tot o forma e si plafonarea facturilor la electricitate, tot trebuie sa plateasca cineva.

In Romania cam toti care nu sunt angajati sunt asistati social intr-o forma sau alta si de multe ori si multi dintre cei angajati.

Erau asistati social inclusiv romanii ucrainieni din Ucraina (fonduri pentru minoritati). Si Bisericiile de fapt sunt asistate social de stat la greu, ele neobtinand venituri (cica).

Deci la asistenta sociala daca tai neinteligent se va vedea si simti rapid, fiind fonduri in general vitale pentru multi oameni. Aici a incercat guvernul sa taie in carne vie la greu. MULT mai mult ca in cheltuielile cu salariile statului.

De fapt, ne reintoarcem in cerc, se taie de la cei multi inclusiv de la stat (politisti, penitenciar) iar cei putini isi mentin pensiile private mari.

Nu ca nu ar fi supraangajati la penitenciar de exemplu. Au ajuns ca la 2 detinuti sa fie angajat 1 om aproape. 1000 de detinuti au 500 de angajati si asta in contextul in care multi detinuti deja lucreaza fizic in inchisoare gen la bucatarie. sa nu va imaginati ca sunt angajati oameni profesionisti in inchisorile din Romania (cum ar trebui de fapt). De asemenea tot detinuti lucreaza pe terenurile inchisorii la gradinarit da, unde planteaza varza,ceapa, cartofi... care vin tot in penitenciar. 95% sunt detinuti ce fac aceste munci ce au un sef de la penitenciar si cativa angajati supraveghetori. curatenia in penitenciar facuta tot de detinuti. tunsul, tot de detinuti. spalatoria, detinuti. reparatii (inclusiv electrice partial cu detinuti, reparatii sanitare-detinuti).  
Deci sa nu va imaginati ca intr-un penitenciar de ex acesti multi angajati ai statului sunt altceva decat plimbatori de hartii (majoritatea), gardieni (nu atat de multi) si pierzatori de timp.

Tot in bugetul de cheltuieli mai apar investii in active nefinanciare! (53 de miliarde de lei) dar de asemenea mai apar si dobanzi de 35.3 miliarde de lei. Iar aceste investitii nu aduc surse importante de venit, tot pe minus sunt si, se pare ca tot platim dobanzi desi investim.

Deci inca 10 miliarde de euro care sunt pur speculativi pentru ca statul sa se joace de-a investitorul (sa cumpere tot felul de actiuni din nationalism ma gandesc). Daca ar taia acest apetit pentru investitii o mare parte din problema ar fi rezolvata, s-ar reduce semnificativ deficitul.

NU AI BANI? Atunci nu investesti! Logic."

Acquisto macchina desiderio Vs reale utilità,ItaliaPersonalFinance,1i9p62k,2025-01-25 10:21:28,0,0.27,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaPersonalFinance/comments/1i9p62k/acquisto_macchina_desiderio_vs_reale_utilità/,tugurredduz,Budgeting e risparmio,"Ciao, spiego un po' la mia situazione M39 convivente con F33 RAL sua 20k circa. Ral mia variabile
Ho una piccola attività commerciale, che lavora abbastanza bene. Ci lavoro da 18anni (l'ho acquistata a 20anni) con aiuto familiare di circa 3/4 ore al giorno su 13ore di apertura 6/7.
La mia situazione patrimoniale è questa: casa del valore di circa 350k nella quale vivo (no mutuo),attività commerciale la cui vendita potrebbe valere dai 100ai180k (no muri,si tratta di licenza commerciale in buona posizione,ma non ho intenzione di vendere a breve), e circa 500k tra liquidità e investimenti vari (fondi,obbligazioni ecc). Due auto, OPEL CORSA GPL del 2017 e Mercedes classe A 2009.
Potrei inoltre contare su un fondo emergenza dei miei genitori (sono figlio unico) di circa 400k,parzialmente investito ma facilmente svincolabile.

A livello di spese,tolte le solite cose (internet,cell,paytv,bollette varie,spesa ecc) nn abbiamo grosse spese...usciamo a cena ogni tanto e facciamo qualche viaggio, niente esperienze extralusso o vizi particolari.
Come spese e costi futuri in programma, stiamo provando ad avere un figlio (che mi auguro arrivi al piu presto).
Diciamo che viviamo una vita abbastanza tranquilla.

Andiamo ora al nocciolo della questione, vorrei cambiare macchina e prendere una Tesla model y dal costo di circa 60k.
I motivi per cui vorrei prenderla sono vari,grande capacità di carico,estetica e divertimento nella guida (a me piace),sono pro elettrico ed ho garage dove caricarla, ma sopratutto vorrei finalmente una macchina che mi dia un po' di ""autostima"".
Son sempre stato quello un po' preso per il culo,quello non figo perchè non aveva i vestiti di marca (pur magari potendoli avere se chiesti ai miei genitori) e adesso pur avendo un'attivtà commerciale avviata vengo spesso scambiato ""per il ragazzino"", un po' per il mio modo di fare tranquillo ed informale, un po' per il mio apsetto esteriore (dimostro tranquillamente un 10/15anni di meno).

Comprare una macchina da 60k (non che sia una supercar eh) per farla vedere agli altri è un motivo stupido, lo so, però credo che una piccola soddisfazone/riconoscimento potrebbe farmi bene.

Ho però un dubbio, posso permettermi realmente la spesa? E' una spesa eccessiva per il mio stato patrimoniale?

Ho una grandissima paura di non poter affrontare spese impreviste o di dover rinunciare a cose ed esperienze per reale mancanza di denaro e quindi trovarmi in una situazione nella quale pur volendo fortemente qualcosa,non posso averla o donarla (alla mia famiglia,ai miei genitori,amici) perchè ""sono povero"".

Mi rendo conto che ci sia tanto di psicologico in questo post, ma mi piacerebbe saper che ne pensate..."

Azkar: un possibile Cavaliere dell'Apocalisse caduto,SacrumTorneamentum,1i9o57k,2025-01-25 09:32:01,3,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacrumTorneamentum/comments/1i9o57k/azkar_un_possibile_cavaliere_dellapocalisse_caduto/,VeterinarianFeisty50,Lore ,"(Edit: scusate ho fatto copia e incolla alcune cose dovete dedurle pk non sa come scrivere simboli tipo ' o *accento*. #LEGGETELO #VERSO #LE #16:30 *non so come si scrive in grassetto*)

Nell'oscuro reame dell'Inferno, l\\u00e0 dove il fuoco si fa pi\\u00f9 nero e le anime gemono in un\\u2019eterna eco di dolore, stava nascendo una leggenda. Il novizio Azkar, destinato a divenire uno dei pi\\u00f9 potenti cavalieri demoniaci mai esistiti, era sull\\u2019orlo della gloria. Possedeva tutto ci\\u00f2 che un demone avrebbe potuto desiderare: forza, astuzia, e un'ombra che si allungava su chiunque lo guardasse. Il suo nome gi\\u00e0 risuonava tra le fiamme, sussurrato dai dannati e temuto dai suoi stessi pari. Tuttavia, quella fama sarebbe durata poco.

Azkar aveva perso l\\u2019anima.

Non si sa con precisione come sia accaduto. Alcuni sussurravano che fosse stato un errore di giovent\\u00f9, un patto sbagliato firmato con troppa arroganza; altri credevano che un\\u2019entit\\u00e0 superiore l\\u2019avesse privato di essa per gelosia del suo potenziale. Qualunque fosse la verit\\u00e0, il risultato era lo stesso: senza la sua anima, Azkar era un guscio vuoto, un guerriero caduto che non poteva pi\\u00f9 ascendere a cavaliere dell\\u2019Apocalisse.

Azkar, nonostante la sua caduta, era ancora un nome che faceva tremare l\\u2019Inferno. I demoni parlavano di lui con una miscela di derisione e nostalgia, ricordando quello che avrebbe potuto diventare: il cavaliere pi\\u00f9 potente, forse persino uno degli Apocalittici. Ma il destino gli era stato crudele, privandolo della sua anima.

Un giorno, mentre camminava attraverso una delle strade caotiche dell\\u2019Inferno, tra mercati infernali e urla di dannati, Azkar incroci\\u00f2 una figura imponente. Luk.

Era impossibile non notarlo: alto, con un mantello che sembrava sfidare il vento, e quegli occhi gialli brillanti che emanavano una luce inquietante ma curiosamente rassicurante. Luk era noto per essere il figlio dell\\u2019Arcidemone della Fortuna, disconosciuto dal padre ma comunque rispettato, o temuto, da molti. Era famoso per il suo senso di giustizia, un concetto che nell\\u2019Inferno veniva spesso visto come una debolezza, ma che in lui aveva un peso innegabile.

Azkar si ferm\\u00f2, fissandolo. Per un attimo, la strada parve fermarsi con loro. Il caos intorno a loro si fece lontano, come se il mondo stesso trattenesse il respiro.

\\u00abSei Azkar,\\u00bb disse Luk, rompendo il silenzio. Non era una domanda.

Azkar annu\\u00ec, il suo sguardo fisso sugli occhi di Luk. Anche senza parole, il suo volto tradiva la sua angoscia, il vuoto che lo divorava.

Luk non esit\\u00f2. Con un gesto calmo, infil\\u00f2 una mano sotto il mantello e ne estrasse una piccola fiamma pulsante, vibrante come un cuore vivo. L\\u2019anima di Azkar.

\\u00ab\\u00c8 tua,\\u00bb disse semplicemente, porgendogliela.

Azkar rimase immobile, il suo sguardo inchiodato alla fiamma. Per un istante, sembr\\u00f2 incapace di credere a ci\\u00f2 che vedeva. Poi, con un gesto rapido, prese la fiamma tra le mani.

Nel momento in cui l\\u2019anima lo tocc\\u00f2, un\\u2019esplosione di luce e calore lo avvolse. La sua figura si raddrizz\\u00f2, il vuoto nei suoi occhi si riemp\\u00ec di una forza antica e inarrestabile. Il cavaliere demoniaco che l\\u2019Inferno aveva perso era finalmente tornato.

Azkar guard\\u00f2 Luk, e per un attimo sembr\\u00f2 cercare le parole giuste. Ma non ne trov\\u00f2. Non c\\u2019era bisogno. Con un cenno del capo, un gesto di profondo rispetto, si volt\\u00f2 e si incammin\\u00f2 verso il suo destino, pronto a reclamare il ruolo che gli spettava.

Per qualche istante, un silenzio irreale avvolse la strada. La folla di demoni, che fino a quel momento aveva osservato la scena in silenzio, rest\\u00f2 immobile, come paralizzata da ci\\u00f2 a cui aveva appena assistito. Poi, lentamente, qualcuno inizi\\u00f2 a mormorare il nome di Luk. Altri si unirono, finch\\u00e9 il suo nome non si trasform\\u00f2 in un coro, una celebrazione spontanea che riemp\\u00ec l\\u2019aria.

\\u00abLuk! Il giusto! Luk, il salvatore di Azkar!\\u00bb

Demoni di ogni rango si avvicinarono a lui, alcuni osando persino toccare il bordo del suo mantello come se avesse acquisito uno status quasi sacro. Luk rimase immobile, impassibile, con i suoi occhi gialli che osservavano la folla. Non cercava quella venerazione, ma nemmeno la rifiut\\u00f2. Sapeva che quel momento avrebbe cambiato il suo destino.

Non pass\\u00f2 molto prima che il rumore della folla venisse interrotto dal ruggito di una carrozza demoniaca. Trainata da creature scheletriche con occhi di fuoco, la carrozza imperiale si ferm\\u00f2 davanti a Luk. Ne scese un messaggero, un demone dalle vesti ornate di rosso e oro, simbolo del Concilio degli Arcidemoni.

\\u00abLuk,\\u00bb annunci\\u00f2 con una voce tonante, inchinandosi leggermente. \\u00abIl Concilio degli Arcidemoni ti convoca a palazzo. La tua impresa non pu\\u00f2 essere ignorata.\\u00bb

Luk annu\\u00ec, mantenendo il suo contegno. Senza esitare, sal\\u00ec sulla carrozza, lasciando la folla a osservarlo con ammirazione.

La Ricompensa

Al palazzo imperiale, Luk venne accolto con tutti gli onori. Gli Arcidemoni, seduti sui loro troni di ossidiana, lo ricevettero come un eroe. Gli vennero offerti ricchezze incalcolabili, terre nei reami infernali e un titolo nobiliare. Ma pi\\u00f9 di tutto, il suo nome fu scolpito nei registri ufficiali come un simbolo di giustizia e coraggio, un evento raro nell\\u2019Inferno.

Tuttavia, mentre accettava i privilegi con la calma che lo caratterizzava, Luk sapeva che mancava ancora qualcosa. Nonostante il rispetto e l\\u2019ammirazione che aveva guadagnato, non era ancora riuscito a rientrare nelle grazie di suo padre, l\\u2019Arcidemone della Fortuna.

Quella ferita, il disconoscimento che aveva segnato tutta la sua esistenza, non poteva essere guarita con onori o ricchezze. Sarebbe servito qualcosa di pi\\u00f9, qualcosa che nemmeno lui sapeva definire.

Eppure, Luk non era scoraggiato. Quella giornata gli aveva dimostrato che il suo cammino, per quanto arduo, lo stava portando nella giusta direzione. E cos\\u00ec, anche tra il lusso del palazzo e il peso del riconoscimento, Luk mantenne il suo sguardo fisso sul futuro, pronto a cogliere l\\u2019occasione giusta per dimostrare, una volta per tutte, il suo valore al padre che lo aveva respinto.

What makes USDS stand out to me is its stability mechanism. It relies on the same mint and burn functionalities as DAI, ensuring a 1:1 conversion ratio. Additionally, it integrates effortlessly with platforms like Sky\_money, enabling users to earn SKY token rewards and engage in other financial activities without hassle.

Salutări tururor! Recent am împlinit un an de când nu am mai pus orice fel de țigări în gură (ghidat după premiza,,caca, nu e voie) și cum nu am altceva mai bun de făcut m-am decis să fac ceva șocant și nemaiîntâlnit până acum : să încerc să fiu util societății și poate să inspir pe cineva să renunțe la fumat, sau poate că stilul meu de a povesti te va amuza așa că dacă îți petreci timpul pe budă în timp ce citești asta îți doresc spor la treabă sau poftă bună dacă mănânci.


Pentru context am început să fumez pe la vârsta de 15 ani în liceu, prima țigară cred că am fumat-o pe la 12 ani. Motivul? Simțeam nevoia să aparțin unui grup, cum colegii de liceu aveau alte pasiuni m-am refugiat la fumoar și fiind la o vârstă ușor influențabilă am ajuns să o fac din ce în ce mai des.
De fumat am fumat 16 ani, din fericire nu am renunțat deoarece mi-a zis vreun doctor că trebuie să o fac că altfel dau ortul popii ci pentru că așa am vrut eu(big Dick energy)
Dunhill negru am fumat din a12a până când m-am lăsat, am încercat și drăciile alea de pufăituri electrice dar nu mi-au plăcut.


Cum a început totul?
 Sincer, a fost din peoprie inițiativă, așa cum cred că fiecare dintre cei ce vor să se lase trebuie să o facă, nu că te bate cineva la cap să o faci, că atunci nu va merge, doar vei strâmba din nas și o să simți că spațiul tău personal este încălcat, că doar fumezi pe banii tăi așa că ce îi fute grija pe alții ce faci cu banii și sănătatea ta.
Ei bine, chestia asta e parțial adevărată deoarece cu viciul ăsta îi deranjezi pe alții, dar ăsta e un subiect la care voi reveni mai târziu.



Primul drum spre eliberarea căilor respiratorii din punctul meu de vedere este CONȘTIENTIZAREA. 

Sunt convins că fumătorii au avut de multe ori conversația asta desprinsă dintr-o seară intensă de Yahoo! Messenger 

-Oh, fumezi?
-Da!
-Dar de ce? Știi că nu e bine?
-Stiu
-si atunci de ce o faci?

De obicei răspunsul varia, ori ridici din umeri și zici că nu știi, ori zici că îți place, ori dacă ești iritat treci direct în modul Savage și începi să îl înjuri pe cel ce te întreabă 

Însă să conștientizezi cat de nasol e să fumezi e primul pas spre a te lăsa, degeaba zici că știi cât e de nasol și că te poți lăsa când vrei, că doar te minți pe tine însuți, ca atunci când zici că de luni începi să faci o chestie ce îți va schimba viața dar normal că nu o vei face. Și îți rămâne impregnată în creier iar din când în când te vei tortura cu gândul că ești al naibii de slab și că nu poți face asta.

Cum conștientizezi? Eu m-am uitat pe YouTube la câteva chestii și mi-a fost suficient, faptul că îți crește presiunea arterială de riști să îți bubuie o venă-n cap e o chestie ce nu ar trebui să o neglijezi, dar dacă tu ești genul ăla de persoană care se crede specială și că ție nu ți se poate întâmpla asta...atunci așteaptă-te la surprize, dar nu alea prezentate de Andreea Marin

Faptul că puți ca un hoit, a furnal industrisl, coșul unei locomotive cu aburi, spune-i cum vrei tu este iarăși ceva ce ar trebui să te îngrijoreze. Problema e că dacă fumezi prea mult mirosul îți dispare și atunci nu vei mai da doi bani că cei din jurul tău trebuie să poarte măști de gaze să stea în jurul tău, e dreptul tău să puți, lumea trebuie să îți suporte viciul.
E neplăcut, nu mai fuma lângă o mulțime de oameni ca un dobitoc, respectă și tu pe alții și nu îi intoxica că așa vor plămânii tăi, nu vor plânge că nu bagi gudronul ăla bun în tine, ai răbdare, ho, băăăăă!
Și nu, mirosul nu ți-a dispărut de la Covid, hai, mă, nu mai căuta scuze!

Evident că nici shaorma nu mai are același gust, nu e pentru că ăia sunt niște excroci care cumpără chestii fără gust ci pentru că și gustul îți este afectat de fumat. Gândește-te puțin...chiar vrei să renunți la amalgamul ăla de sosuri ieftine, legume cu euri și carne cauciucată doar pentru a fuma? Dacă vrei ajutor la întrebarea asta întreabă-l pe Lenghel!

Cea mai amuzantă chestie este bine cunoscuta tusă, pentru că nimic nu poate fi mai sexy decât să vezi un om care tușește și elimină mucozități venite din plămâni care efectiv plâng și îți zic cât de idiot ești și încearcă să elimine din toxinele pe care le bagi în tine.
Fun fact : chiar dispare treptat dacă te lași, așa că ce mai aștepți?


O altă chestie pe care poate nu o realizezi este faptul că îți scade sistemul imunitar.
Da, dar tu știi că străbunicul a băut și a fumat până la 95 de ani și nu a avut nici pe dracu. 
Dacă chiar crezi în astea ceva îmi zice că ai pus botul și la prințul nigerian ce te-a contactat să îl ajuți să își recapete tronul prin donarea unei anumite sume de bani și că de îndată ce își va recăpăta tronul vei fi îngropat în aur.
Da, devii mucos mai repede, corpul se regenerează mai greu, stai mai mult timp beteag, spune-i cum vrei tu, dar e nașpa.

Evident că și situația financiară este nasoală, dacă dai 30 de lei pe zi pe un pachet sau o dată la 2 zile ăia sunt niște bani care în timp ar putea fi investiți în altceva, dar fă un bine tuturor și dacă fumezi nu te plânge altora de bani, că literalmente îi arzi, mulți ar vrea să îți zică,, bă nu mai fuma să ai mai mulți bani"" dar nu e treaba lor să îți zică și speră să îți pleznească aorta ca să nu mai audă veșniciile tale probleme.


 
Și acum poate cea mai nasoală chestie, faptul că devii sclavul țigărilor. Cine mă, tu? Nici vorbă, doar tu te lași când vor mușchii tăi.
Sincer să fiu doar când te lași realizezi asta : asociezi fumatul cu orice căcat pe care îl faci. Mănânci? După o masă gustoasă merge o țigară canceroasă. Te duci la film? Mai e timp până începe, bagă o țigară, te duci la Lidl să îți iei un covrig cu cașcaval? Bagă o țigară înainte și după ce ieși în fața magazinului ca să îți marchezi teritoriul.
Partea bună este că poți face orice fără să fumezi, nu o să cadă niciun asteroid peste planetă ca să înceapă o nouă eră glaciară dacă renunți la a mai fuma înainte sau după ce faci ceva.


Dar cum rămâne cu țigarea de după?  Ei bine, dacă crezi că pentrul el/ea sexul nu are farmec fără țigara de după atunci ceva îmi zice că poziția ta preferată e misionarul și imaginația ta e mai seacă ca glumele mele din această postare și că până și păpușa gonflabilă ar miza orgasmul doar ca să scape de tine .



Cum e viața fără țigări?
Bă, e bună, nu mă pot plânge, la început o să resimți sevrajul, dar chestia asta este diferită de la om la om, nu pot să zic că m-am urcat pe pereți sau că am pocnit pe cineva la început, ce-i drept simțeam o repulsie mai mare decât de obicei față de oameni dar îmi repetam că e pentru binele meu și că trebuie să o fac.
Faza e să te bucuri și să conștientizezi că ai mirosul și gustul mai bun, nu mai puți și te miști altfel. 
Îmi aduc aminte cum la un moment dat am pedalat un deal pe care nu puteam să îl dovedesc sub nicio formă (asta pentru că sunt și gras și mă urăște gravitația dar aia e partea a doua) iar când am ajuns în vârf am scos telefonul și am pus fragmentul de primăvară de la Vivaldi de fericire că am putut să pedalez până în capăt. Ce-i drept se uitau ciudat oamenii la mine și cel mai probabil  credeau că am o criză de epilepsie, dar cui îi pasă? În viață e important să te bucuri de chestiile mici și insignifiante cum ar fi returnarea ambalajelor din plastic.

Performanța mea ca jucător amator de fotbal pe teren redus (adică pe sintetic, am vrut doar să pară pompoasă denumirea) s-a îmbunătățit considerabil iar reflexele și deplasarea s-au îmbunătățit ceea ce mi-a ridicat self esteem-ul 


O altă chestie importantă: să nu crezi că dacă te lași de fumat îți va face cineva statuie pentru treaba asta, o mână de oameni se vor bucura pentru tine, dar nu o să te întrebe zilnic și nici nu îți vor ridica un altar în cinstea ta pentru a îți pupa icoana că ai decis să faci ceva bine pentru tine.
Sănătatea ta e responsabilitatea ta și numai a ta, la fel ca și în cazul fericirii.

Nu vorbi excesiv despre că te-ai lăsat și fă bine să crezi că multora nu le pasă că te-ai lăsat pentru că e adevărat.

În cazul în care a citit cineva toată povestea îți mulțumesc pentru timpul acordat, dacă există oameni care au întrebări atunci le puteți pune, o să răspund.

O zi bună tuturor!"

Me irrita ver como los hombres hetero y bisexuales (sobre todo los hetero) se pelean unos contra otros por la atención de las mujeres. Vendrán los de la píldora roja y me dirán que es por la testosterona, y es mentira, los hombres pelean por mujeres porque sienten que ellos no valen para otra cosa. Muchos creen que la vida de un hombre no tiene sentido sin una mujer, que tener sexo con mujeres es el mayor mérito del mundo y que morir virgen o morir habiéndo tenido sexo con otros hombres es una vergüenza.

¿Os dais cuenta de que poneis a la mujer en un pedestal? Sea por machismo o sea por feminismo, siempre están los hombres promedio desesperados por la situación de aquellas que nacieron con vagina. Las mujeres no persiguen a los hombres y si lo hacen, ellas son tachadas de locas. 

Es increible, lo que pasa es que damos por hecho que la mujer es bella universalmente y el hombre solo lo es en un 1% de casos. Eso de que el 80% de mujeres atrae a un 20% de hombres pero no al reves, es el resultado de que los hombres están desesperados por follar y las mujeres se aprovechan de ellos. No significa que las mujeres sean mas deseables. Lo peor es que veo incluso a muchos gays poniendo a las mujeres como diosas en lo que respecta a su apariencia. 

Hombres y chicos, quereros a vosotros mismos un poco y dejar de poner a las mujeres en un pedestal. Los simps, los incels, y sus opuestos (que son los casanovas) sois todos igual de patéticos. "

Questo strumento consente l'avvio di giochi direttamente da hard disk interni formattati in exFAT e ora introduce anche il supporto per dispositivi MMCE come SD2PSX e MemCard PRO2.\
NHDDL, basato su Neutrino, esegue una scansione dei dispositivi supportati (MMCE o dispositivi BDM formattati in FAT/exFAT) alla ricerca di file ISO, elencandoli e consentendo l'avvio di un titolo selezionato tramite Neutrino.\
Offre anche funzioni avanzate come la visualizzazione dell'ID del gioco per attivare impostazioni specifiche per titolo sui prodotti della linea Pixel FX e per la gestione delle memory card per titolo su dispositivi SD2PSX e MemCard PRO2.\
Tuttavia, NHDDL non intende sostituire Open PS2 Loader, mancando di funzionalità come GSM, PADEMU, IGR, cheats e altre, a meno che queste non siano integrate in Neutrino.\
\
Utilizzo\
Controlli della lista dei titoli\
\
 	Premere  sul d-pad per selezionare il titolo precedente nella lista.\
 	Premere  sul d-pad per selezionare il titolo successivo nella lista.\
 	Premere  per passare alla pagina precedente o tornare all'inizio della lista.\
 	Premere  per passare alla pagina successiva o andare alla fine della lista.\
\
Note importanti\
NHDDL richiede l'installazione completa di Neutrino in uno dei seguenti percorsi:\
\
 	/neutrino.elf (potrebbe essere sensibile alle maiuscole e alle minuscole a seconda del dispositivo).\
 	mmceX:/neutrino/neutrino.elf (dispositivi MMCE, funzionante anche se la modalità MMCE non è abilitata).\
 	massX:/neutrino/neutrino.elf (dispositivi BDM, se abilitata una modalità BDM).\
 	mcX:/APPS/neutrino/neutrino.elf (schede di memoria, potrebbe essere sensibile alle maiuscole e alle minuscole).\
 	mcX:/NEUTRINO/NEUTRINO.ELF (percorso SAS su schede di memoria, potrebbe essere sensibile alle maiuscole e alle minuscole).\
 	mcX:/NEUTRINO/neutrino.elf (percorso SAS su schede di memoria, potrebbe essere sensibile alle maiuscole e alle minuscole).\
\
Per impostazione predefinita, NHDDL tenta di inizializzare tutti i dispositivi supportati, è possibile ridurre i tempi di inizializzazione specificando una modalità nel file di configurazione del launcher.\
Consultare questa sezione sul file nhddl.yaml per ulteriori dettagli.\
Non collegare dispositivi di archiviazione BDM durante l'esecuzione di NHDDL! Questo potrebbe causare crash di NHDDL e/o corrompere i file sul dispositivo a causa del funzionamento dei driver BDM.\
\
Versioni\
L'installazione prevede due versioni: una standalone, che non richiede moduli di Neutrino integrati, e una non-standalone, che utilizza i moduli già inclusi nel pacchetto di Neutrino per ridurre le dimensioni del file ELF.\
\
Versione standalone\
\
 	Non richiede moduli Neutrino per il supporto BDM e può essere avviata da qualsiasi dispositivo.\
 	Il file nhddl.elf è più grande, ma supporta ELF loader che scaricano tutto prima di avviare NHDDL dai dispositivi BDM.\
 	Tuttavia, Neutrino è comunque necessario per avviare gli ISO.\
\
Installazione manuale\
\
 	Scaricare l'ultima versione di nhddl.elf.\
 	Copiare nhddl.elf sulla scheda di memoria o sul dispositivo di archiviazione.\
 	Se necessario, modificare il file nhddl.yaml per configurare le modalità desiderate e copiarlo accanto al file nhddl.elf.\
 	Scaricare l'ultima versione di Neutrino.\
 	Copiare la cartella Neutrino nella root della scheda di memoria PS2 o del dispositivo di archiviazione.\
\
Installazione tramite PSU\
\
 	Scaricare il file nhddl.psu.\
 	Copiarlo su un'unità USB.\
 	Aprire wLaunchELF sulla PS2.\
 	Copiare il file nhddl.psu sulla scheda di memoria (mc0 o mc1) usando il comando psuPaste.\
 	Copiare la cartella Neutrino nella root della scheda di memoria o del dispositivo di archiviazione.\
\
Versione non-standalone\
\
 	Riutilizza i moduli Neutrino per il supporto BDM, rendendo il file nhddl.elf più piccolo.\
 	I moduli necessari sono inclusi nell'archivio ZIP di Neutrino.\
\
Installazione\
\
 	Scaricare l'ultima versione di nhddl.elf.\
 	Estrarre i file di Neutrino.\
 	Copiare il file nhddl.elf nella cartella Neutrino accanto a neutrino.elf.\
 	Modificare il file nhddl.yaml, se necessario, e copiarlo accanto a nhddl.elf.\
 	Copiare la cartella Neutrino sulla scheda di memoria PS2 o sul dispositivo di archiviazione.\
\
Nota\
Se si verifica l'errore Failed to prepare external modules:\
\
 	Assicurarsi che il launcher ELF inizializzi i moduli BDM e non resetti l'IOP prima di caricare NHDDL.\
 	In alternativa, utilizzare la versione standalone o copiare Neutrino su una scheda di memoria o un dispositivo MMCE.\
\
Modalità supportate\
\
 	ATA\
\
 	Moduli richiesti:\
bdm.irx, bdmfs_fatfs.irx, dev9_ns.irx, ata_bd.irx\
 	Specificare mode: ata in nhddl.yaml per saltare altri dispositivi.\
\
\
 	MX4SIO\
\
 	Moduli richiesti:\
bdm.irx, bdmfs_fatfs.irx, mx4sio_bd_mini.irx\
 	Specificare mode: mx4sio in nhddl.yaml.\
\
\
 	USB\
\
 	Moduli richiesti:\
bdm.irx, bdmfs_fatfs.irx, usbd_mini.irx, usbmass_bd_mini.irx\
 	Specificare mode: usb in nhddl.yaml.\
\
\
 	UDPBD\
\
 	Moduli richiesti:\
bdm.irx, bdmfs_fatfs.irx, dev9_ns.irx, smap_udpbd.irx\
 	Richiede l'indirizzo IP della PS2 (specificato in nhddl.yaml o IPCONFIG.DAT).\
\
\
 	iLink\
\
 	Moduli richiesti:\
bdm.irx, bdmfs_fatfs.irx, iLinkman.irx, IEEE1394_bd_mini.irx\
 	Specificare mode: ilink in nhddl.yaml.\
\
\
 	MMCE\
\
 	Dispositivi supportati: SD2PSX, MemCard PRO2\
 	Specificare mode: mmce in nhddl.yaml.\
\
\
\
Archiviazione delle ISO\
Le immagini ISO possono essere archiviate praticamente ovunque sul dispositivo di archiviazione, ma non oltre 5 directory di profondità.\
Ad esempio: Le immagini ISO archiviati in DVD/A/B/C/D saranno scansionati e aggiunti alla lista, mentre gli ISO archiviati in DVD/A/B/C/D/E saranno ignorati.\
Inoltre, le directory che iniziano con . o $ e le seguenti directory vengono ignorate per velocizzare il processo di scansione:\
\
\
 	nhddl\
 	APPS\
 	ART\
 	CFG\
 	CHT\
 	LNG\
 	THM\
 	VMC\
 	XEBPLUS\
 	MemoryCards\
\
Visualizzazione delle cover\
NHDDL utilizza lo stesso formato e la stessa convenzione di denominazione delle cover utilizzate da OPL.\
Basta posizionare file PNG di dimensioni 140x200 con il nome _COV.png (ad esempio, SLUS_200.02_COV.png) nella directory ART situata nella radice dell'HDD.\
Se non si è certi di dove reperire le cover, è possibile consultare l'ultima versione di OPL Manager.\
File di configurazione\
NHDDL utilizza file in stile YAML per caricare e salvare le opzioni di configurazione.\
File di configurazione del launcher\
La configurazione del launcher viene letta dal file nhddl.yaml. Il file poi viene caricato da uno dei seguenti percorsi:\
\
 	/nhddl.yaml (potrebbe essere sensibile alle maiuscole/minuscole a seconda del dispositivo)\
 	mcX:/NHDDL/nhddl.yaml (memory card, sensibile a maiuscole/minuscole)\
 	mcX:/NHDDL-CONF/nhddl.yaml (memory card, sensibile a maiuscole/minuscole)\
 	massX:/nhddl/nhddl.yaml (dispositivi BDM, se è attivata una modalità BDM)\
 	mmceX:/nhddl/nhddl.yaml (dispositivi MMCE, se è attivata la modalità MMCE)\
\
Questo file è opzionale e serve solo per forzare la modalità video dell'interfaccia utente di NHDDL o impostare la modalità dispositivo di NHDDL. Di default, viene utilizzata la modalità video predefinita e tutti i dispositivi BDM vengono utilizzati per cercare file ISO.\
Per disabilitare un'opzione, basta commentarla con il simbolo #.\
\
Esempio di un file nhddl.yaml valido può essere trovato nella documentazione.\
File di configurazione aggiuntivi sul dispositivo di archiviazione\
NHDDL memorizza e cerca file di configurazione relativi agli ISO nella directory nhddl nella radice del dispositivo BDM.\
\
\
 	lastTitle.bin\
Memorizza il percorso completo dell'ultimo titolo avviato e consente di navigarci automaticamente al successivo avvio di NHDDL. Viene creato automaticamente.\
 	cache.bin\
Contiene una cache degli ID titolo per tutti gli ISO rilevati durante l'ultimo avvio, velocizzando la creazione della lista ISO. Anche questo file viene creato automaticamente.\
\
File di argomenti\
Questi file memorizzano argomenti arbitrari che vengono passati a Neutrino durante l'avvio di un titolo. Gli argomenti salvati vengono passati a neutrino.elf così come sono.\
Per un elenco di argomenti validi, consultare il file README di Neutrino.\
Esempio di file argomenti valido\
# All flags are passed to neutrino as-is for future-proofing, comments are ignored\
gc: 2\
mc0: /memcard0.bin # all file paths must be relative to device root\
$mc1: /VMC/memcard1.bin # this argument is disabled\
# Arguments that don't have a value\
# Empty values are treated as a simple flag\
dbc:\
logo:\
NHDDL utilizza un simbolo $ per indicare quali argomenti sono abilitati o disabilitati per default. Solo gli argomenti abilitati vengono passati a Neutrino.\
\
Tipi di file argomenti supportati\
\
 	global.yaml\
Gli argomenti salvati in nhddl/global.yaml si applicano a tutti gli ISO per default.\
 	File specifici per ISO\
Gli argomenti salvati in nhddl/.yaml si applicano solo agli ISO che iniziano con .\
NHDDL può creare automaticamente questi file quando le modalità di compatibilità vengono modificate e salvate tramite l'interfaccia utente.\
\
Conservazione delle ISO\
Gli ISO possono essere archiviati praticamente ovunque sul dispositivo di archiviazione, ma non oltre 5 directory di profondità.\
Ad esempio: gli ISO archiviati in DVD/A/B/C/D saranno scansionati e aggiunti alla lista, mentre gli ISO archiviati in DVD/A/B/C/D/E saranno ignorati.\
Inoltre, le directory che iniziano con . o $ e le seguenti directory vengono ignorate per velocizzare il processo di scansione:\

Regardless,here it goes)

Test of valor returns

Survival mode returns

Mission mode returns

Tag mode remains

Chapter select remains 

Melee Weapons: all nerfs reverted. Enmas fang remains.

IS ninjas,IS usage is lowered by 25% and splash damage is reduced by 40% - this will effectively break the IS ninjas in so the spam isn't just a bullet hail. Gaja - grab damage reduced by 40%. Dogs: reduced count. Werewolves,only red werewolves can throw body parts. Fiend dragons will lose 40% of their hp to account for the fact that they cannot be delimbed.

Alexei,remains unchanged from 360 version. No grab damage increase.
Water dragon: mix of both Projectile and Aquatic combat,platforms will appear to allow for either or.

Baby fiend: Remains unchanged.
Archfiend: reduced splash damage from meteor,no longer retreats into the background,and has reduced damage to landing.

Specific changes: chapter 10 will not have 4 rasetsus coming at you,that's completely bs and ridiculous. It'll be 2 and they'll be spaced out. 
The stairway fight will remain as it was in OG2. 

Chapter 11 will have reduced Archer count and keep the tengu brothers(complete fodder)

For the most part,that's kinda what a definitive NG2 experience is in my mind. Seriously tho...give us a fucking toggle for the bow,I do not want to be staring at it all damn game long."

Contratto di mediazione creditizia poco chiaro,Avvocati,1i9jwu7,2025-01-25 05:07:34,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avvocati/comments/1i9jwu7/contratto_di_mediazione_creditizia_poco_chiaro/,_FlyMeToTheMoon__,Banche & Assicurazioni,"Buongiorno a tutti,

  
in data 16.01.2025 ho firmato da remoto un contratto di mediazione creditizia con la società Kiron. Per motivi lavorativi, il contratto è stato firmato da remoto e non ho avuto la possibilità di leggerlo prima di firmarlo (affidandomi su quanto mi era stato spiegato in sede dai loro consulenti qualche settimana prima).



Dopo aver ricevuto la copia firmata del contratto, mi metto a leggerlo e noto che hanno spuntato, in totale autonomia e senza mai avermene parlato, una clausola di esclusività che cita: 

""Esclusiva ed irrevocabile: Il Cliente, pertanto, per tutta la durata dell’incarico non potrà per alcun motivo conferire analogo incarico di mediazione creditizia ad altro professionista, ovvero, operare in proprio o con altri operatori anche non professionali per l’ottenimento del domandato finanziamento. In via di controprestazione e a bilanciamento dell’esclusiva, Kiron: a) impegnerà la propria organizzazione professionale nei termini pattuiti, assumendo a suo carico ogni onere della detta organizzazione. b) presterà assistenza al cliente fino all’atto notarile."" (art.7)



Li chiamo e faccio presente che non era mai stata discussa questa clausola e che vorrei che non ci fosse. In particolare, mi secca il fatto che non possa negoziare per mio conto in autonomia un mutuo senza comunque dover riconoscere a loro la provvigione. Preciso che, da colloquio con loro, il tutto era nato come un ""cerchiamo di capire che range ti da una banca così puoi metterti a cercare casa"". Non avevano parlato di alcun impegno nei loro confronti. Da come me l'hanno raccontata era solo un ""vediamo cosa ti danno poi decidi come muoverti"".



Nella chiamata, inizialmente, mi è stato detto che sono solo uno che vuole giocare (?), alludendo al fatto che non avessi intenzioni serie. Ho specificato che non era affatto così, ma che anzi la mia intenzione è ovviamente quella di fare un mutuo e comprare casa, ma l'essere così aggredito mi ha dato particolarmente fastidio. Successivamente hanno girato in torno alla mia richiesta per diversi minuti.

In tutto ciò chiedo se possiamo aggiungere un addendum al contratto dove si specifica che la clausola di esclusività non è più applicata. Silenzio stampa. Dicono che non è il loro modus operandi, che la clausola la mettono di default (nel loro modulo è opzionale), che mi barrano un no di fianco alla barra e rifirmano il contratto (non so fino a che punto può avere valore legale anche considerando il fatto che chi mi rifirmerebbe il contratto sarebbbe una persona diversa da quello che lo ha firmato la prima volta e non so se ha poteri di firma).

Ad oggi, ad oltre una settimana dalla mia richiesta, non ho ricevuto alcuna proposta da loro in merito al cambiamento da me richiesto e l'impressione è che stiano temporeggiando il più possibile, arrivando anche a non rispondere alle chiamate.

  
In aggiunta, rileggendo il contratto leggo che:

""...la provvigione sarà comunque dovuta nell’ipotesi in cui sarà rifiutata la conclusione del finanziamento, dopo convocazione scritta, a seguito di approvazione della banca e/o intermediario."" (art. 6.3)

  
A me è arrivata una mail da una banca scelta da loro (ING) nella quale citano che mi è stata accettata una predelibera reddituale nella quale è scritto l'importo massimo che posso andare a chiedere a mutuo. 

Questo da diritto loro alla provvigione?



Considerando la poca chiarezza e considerando il loro atteggiamento, vorrei recedere dal contratto, anche per motivi di vizio. Sono in tempo nei 14 giorni per recedere senza conseguenze?



Per completezza qui ci sono [copia del contratto di mediazione](https://brescia1.kiron.it/PDF/trasparenza/Contratto_Mediazione_Creditizia_Mutuo.pdf?v=230420241531) e [informativa generale](https://roma3.kiron.it/PDF/trasparenza/Foglio_Informativo_v.1-18.pdf) dove vi sono scritti i tempi per il recesso.

Grazie mille a chiunque risponderà e scusatemi il wall of text, ma ho voluto essere quanto più specifico.

Absolutely marvelous service from BanzaiHobby Team for them to follow up with all my queries and ship it to INDIA. they did a really good job, I paid for Ems I have the package in about 9 days. Will order from them again.

Now, the Indian Customs. 3564 JPY converts to approx 2k INR For some reason these mfs increased it to 2.4k and then added customs of INR 1011+100(postal handling fees)

Why did they even increased the price to 2.4k INR?

Also ruined the box, but luckily didn't open the wrap.

Altogether I had to pay INR 4517 which is still less than paying almost INR 9000.

This post is also an awareness post for fellow Indians who wanna get Gunpla.

Regardless, I'm still happy with it in my hands. Will build and post.

Could anyone help me with the tools or suggestions?"

Nel GENNAIO 1969, si approcciò a mezzo anno luce di distanza dal pianeta terra una civiltà che usava come mezzo di trasporto un buco nero artificiale, attorno al quale ruotavano quattro soli , attorno ai quali ruotavano quattro ""Giove caldi"" e , a grande distanza, quattro ""giganti ghiacciati"". 

L'intera struttura,grande 40 au (6 miliardi di chilometri) era ricoperta da una cupola simile ad una "" sfera di Dyson"",ma che aveva un obiettivo molto differente, ovvero quello di nasconderla ad occhi ostili, come farebbe un ""aereo stealth"", perché come insegna bene la ""teoria della foresta oscura "" del paradosso di Fermi , le forme di vita evolute hanno molto da temere dalle altre. 

Nonostante questi sforzi , furono avvistati sia da un ""essere della notte"" che pattugliava gli  strati più esterni della ""Nube di Oort"" a 100.000 au di distanza dalla terra (15 mila miliardi di chilometri) sia dai Nibelunghi di Urano. 

Questa civiltà voleva aggiungere il nostro sole ai quattro soli che già possedevano per avere altra energia, quindi alcuni loro esploratori si avvicinarono al sole per capire come renderlo un satellite del loro buco nero artificiale, come avevano gia fatto con i 4 soli che gia possedevano . L' ""essere della notte"" pattugliante la Nube di Oort decise di tenerli d'occhio e per farlo, si trasformò in una copia esatta della Luna e lanciò via la vera luna alla velocità della luce (grazie ai suoi poteri , la luna non subì alcun danno,anche se le normali leggi della fisica avrebbero dovuto distruggerla in mille pezzi,oltre ad impedire che potesse raggiungere la velocità della luce) .

Poiché i terrapiattisti ricevettero questa informazione ( col tramite degli squali di Giove) dai Nibelunghi, essi compresero che l' ""essere della notte"" fosse Satana. 

Infatti gli ""esseri della notte"" cacciarono sino all'estinzione i Nibelunghi su Nibiru,che poi fecero esplodere , 4,5 miliardi di anni fa, perché erano ghiotti delle loro carni , soprattutto il fegato, per poi uccidere cacciandoli anche il 95% dei Nibelunghi di Urano . Colpiti da questa Apocalisse, i Nibelunghi hanno sempre considerato gli ""esseri della notte"" degli esseri satanici, e per questo descrissero come Satana l' ""essere della notte"" che si trasformò in una copia esatta della luna.

Da qui viene la folle teoria secondo la quale gli Astronauti sarebbero sbarcati su Satana trasformato nella luna, anche se in realtà questi eventi sono accaduti a partire dal  gennaio 1969 , quando lo sbarco sulla luna è avvenuto in luglio , quando l'essere della notte aveva smesso da mesi di essere trasformato nella luna , per cui è pazzesco sostenere che gli Astronauti sarebbero sbarcati sull' ""essere della notte"", ovvero Satana,come l'avrebbe definito qualunque Nibelungo del sistema solare.

L'essere della notte avrebbe potuto fare detonare il buco nero artificiale,  distruggendo nell'onda d'urto  i quattro soli e gli otto pianeti in pochi secondi, ma dato che loro sono abituati a decisioni collettive, scappò in tutta fretta nel centro del buco nero supermassiccio vicino al centro della galassia Andromeda, ove si trova l'essere della notte più vicino. 


Per continuare a sorvegliare gli invasori,si tolse il suo occhio destro (come le Parche e le Moire può staccarsi un occhio a piacimento senza che subisca danni) che in un picosecondo si trasformò in una copia esatta della luna,mentre l'essere della notte smise di essere trasformato nella luna per ritornare al suo aspetto normale. 

Due minuti dopo spiegò l'urgente problema all'essere della notte di Andromeda, e decisero di radunare tutti gli altri esseri della notte che vivono dentro la cavità orbitale dell'occhio destro del teschio di Ymir, ove si trova anche la via lattea, poiché per fortuna l'occhio destro (trasformato in una copia della luna) dell'essere della notte permetteva di monitorare la situazione in tempo reale.

Nel frattempo la civiltà degli invasori si fermò osservando uno spettacolo stupefacente: c'era della vita su un pianeta roccioso, la Terra ! Loro davano per scontato che non potesse esistere la vita su un pianeta del genere e infatti la cercavano solo nei pianeti simili ai loro , ovvero nei ""Giove caldi"" e nei ""giganti ghiacciati"". A causa dell'assurda e stupefacente scoperta , decisero di non distruggere queste bizzarre forme di vita aggiungendo la nostra stella al loro buco nero artificiale, poiché a loro bastavano pochi anni per trovare un'altra stella da afferrare al posto del nostro sole . 

Questo colpo di scena fu osservato dall'occhio destro ( trasformato in una copia esatta della luna )dell'essere della notte che fu così confortato dal fatto che lui e quello di Andromeda avrebbero avuto il tempo di avvertire gli altri , odiando la possibilità di non potere prendere la decisione collettivamente. 

Passati tre mesi , il tempo necessario a percorrere i 130 miliardi di anni luce della dimensione della cavità orbitale dell'occhio destro del teschio di Ymir e a tornare nel sistema solare, gli esseri della notte locali sconfissero  la civiltà di invasori , e trasformarono in una zona di caccia i quattro ""giganti ghiacciati "" che ruotavano attorno ai quattro soli che ruotavano attorno al buco nero artificiale perché vi abitava una forma di vita quasi identica ai Nibelunghi di Urano (per evoluzione convergente,  dato che sono tutti ""giganti ghiacciati"") e di conseguenza dalle carni deliziose come le loro (soprattutto il fegato). 

I draghi del cielo che abitavano nei quattro "" Giove caldi"" che ruotavano anch'essi attorno a quei quattro soli furono uccisi tutti immediatamente, avendo delle carni dal gusto mediocre, e I quattro ""Giove caldi"" furono lanciati dentro i 4 soli perché non avevano nessun motivo di esistere per gli "" esseri della notte "" . 

Essendo stata sventata la minaccia , ovviamente l'occhio destro (trasformato in una copia esatta della luna) dell'essere della notte che avvertì tutti gli altri fu recuperato dal suo proprietario, e poiché accadde alla fine di Aprile del 1969 , questo implica che quando gli Astronauti sbarcarono sulla luna nel luglio 1969 , quella era la luna vera , e non un satanico (per i Nibelunghi) essere della notte (o un suo occhio) trasformato

Infatti gli ""esseri della notte"" cacciarono sino all'estinzione i Nibelunghi su Nibiru,che poi fecero esplodere , 4,5 miliardi di anni fa, perché erano ghiotti delle loro carni , soprattutto il fegato, per poi uccidere cacciandoli anche il 95% dei Nibelunghi di Urano . Colpiti da questa Apocalisse, i Nibelunghi hanno sempre considerato gli ""esseri della notte"" degli esseri satanici, e per questo descrissero come Satana l' ""essere della notte"" che si trasformò in una copia esatta della luna.

Da qui viene la folle teoria secondo la quale gli Astronauti sarebbero sbarcati su Satana trasformato nella luna, anche se in realtà questi eventi sono accaduti a partire dal  gennaio 1969 , quando lo sbarco sulla luna è avvenuto in luglio , quando l'essere della notte aveva smesso da mesi di essere trasformato nella luna , per cui è pazzesco sostenere che gli Astronauti sarebbero sbarcati sull' ""essere della notte"", ovvero Satana,come l'avrebbe definito qualunque Nibelungo del sistema solare.

L'essere della notte avrebbe potuto fare detonare il buco nero artificiale,  distruggendo nell'onda d'urto  i quattro soli e gli otto pianeti in pochi secondi, ma dato che loro sono abituati a decisioni collettive, scappò in tutta fretta nel centro del buco nero supermassiccio vicino al centro della galassia Andromeda, ove si trova l'essere della notte più vicino. 


Per continuare a sorvegliare gli invasori,si tolse il suo occhio destro (come le Parche e le Moire può staccarsi un occhio a piacimento senza che subisca danni) che in un picosecondo si trasformò in una copia esatta della luna,mentre l'essere della notte smise di essere trasformato nella luna per ritornare al suo aspetto normale. 

Due minuti dopo spiegò l'urgente problema all'essere della notte di Andromeda, e decisero di radunare tutti gli altri esseri della notte che vivono dentro la cavità orbitale dell'occhio destro del teschio di Ymir, ove si trova anche la via lattea, poiché per fortuna l'occhio destro (trasformato in una copia della luna) dell'essere della notte permetteva di monitorare la situazione in tempo reale.

Nel frattempo la civiltà degli invasori si fermò osservando uno spettacolo stupefacente: c'era della vita su un pianeta roccioso, la Terra ! Loro davano per scontato che non potesse esistere la vita su un pianeta del genere e infatti la cercavano solo nei pianeti simili ai loro , ovvero nei ""Giove caldi"" e nei ""giganti ghiacciati"". A causa dell'assurda e stupefacente scoperta , decisero di non distruggere queste bizzarre forme di vita aggiungendo la nostra stella al loro buco nero artificiale, poiché a loro bastavano pochi anni per trovare un'altra stella da afferrare al posto del nostro sole . 

Questo colpo di scena fu osservato dall'occhio destro ( trasformato in una copia esatta della luna )dell'essere della notte che fu così confortato dal fatto che lui e quello di Andromeda avrebbero avuto il tempo di avvertire gli altri , odiando la possibilità di non potere prendere la decisione collettivamente. 

Passati tre mesi , il tempo necessario a percorrere i 130 miliardi di anni luce della dimensione della cavità orbitale dell'occhio destro del teschio di Ymir e a tornare nel sistema solare, gli esseri della notte locali sconfissero  la civiltà di invasori , e trasformarono in una zona di caccia i quattro ""giganti ghiacciati "" che ruotavano attorno ai quattro soli che ruotavano attorno al buco nero artificiale perché vi abitava una forma di vita quasi identica ai Nibelunghi di Urano (per evoluzione convergente,  dato che sono tutti ""giganti ghiacciati"") e di conseguenza dalle carni deliziose come le loro (soprattutto il fegato). 

I draghi del cielo che abitavano nei quattro "" Giove caldi"" che ruotavano anch'essi attorno a quei quattro soli furono uccisi tutti immediatamente, avendo delle carni dal gusto mediocre, e I quattro ""Giove caldi"" furono lanciati dentro i 4 soli perché non avevano nessun motivo di esistere per gli "" esseri della notte "" . 

Essendo stata sventata la minaccia , ovviamente l'occhio destro (trasformato in una copia esatta della luna) dell'essere della notte che avvertì tutti gli altri fu recuperato dal suo proprietario, e poiché accadde alla fine di Aprile del 1969 , questo implica che quando gli Astronauti sbarcarono sulla luna nel luglio 1969 , quella era la luna vera , e non un satanico (per i Nibelunghi) essere della notte (o un suo occhio) trasformato

Aceasta postare te-a gasit intr-un tarziu... dar te-a gasit,CasualRO,1i9j4yy,2025-01-25 04:08:41,0,0.31,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualRO/comments/1i9j4yy/aceasta_postare_tea_gasit_intrun_tarziu_dar_tea/,Status_Echo8853,:discutie: Discuție,"Pentru inceput, citeste ascultand asta : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWewdTkghM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWewdTkghM) 

Scriu asta atât pentru mine, cât și, poate, pentru tine. Nu sunt un guru spiritual, dar am descoperit ceva care poate fi de ajutor daca accepti. Mai bine scriu la persoana intai ca sa constientizezi si sa iti vina mai usor sa citesti.

Sunt suficient. Sunt suficient de bun pentru viata pe care o duc. A fost o perioada stresanta. Scoala / facultatea / job-ul / Oamenii din jur vor ceva de la mine. Au asteptari de la mine. Nu stiu de ce, dar asta ma face anxios, ma face sa intru in depresie, ma face sa ma simt trist, sa ma simt josnic, bun de nimic. 

Dar sunt suficient. Sunt indeajuns de bun. Cum am ajuns la asta ? Am luat 5 minute pauza de la tot, am facut un pas in spate si m-am uitat la mine dintr-o alta perspectiva. Cand am facut asta, parca toate obstacolele din viata mea s-au diminuat. Pentru prea mult timp le-am acordat importanta, le-am demonizat, le-am exagera;, cand colo, din aceasta noua perspectiva, le-am vazut cum sunt ele in realitate. Niste nimicuri carora nu trebuie sa le dam prea multa importanta. Examene, asteptari, proiecte. 

Mai mult de atat nu ai ce sa controlezi : gandurile, actiunile si reactiile. Doar astea 3. Cand constientizezi asta parca viata este mai manageable, nu ? Nu poti controla parerile altor oameni, nu poti controla vremea, nu poti controla ca va avea sa vina. 

""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present"" - Citat din Kung fu Panda. Nu te mai gandi la ce ai facut in trecut. Nici la ce va veni in viitor fiindca nu ai control asupra lor. Gandeste-te si concentreaza-te pe prezent. Invata acum , lucreaza la proiect acum, fii bun acum cu tine insuti. Calmeaza-te,nu este totul asa de rau precum il vezi. Anxietatea este autogenerata si autolimitanta daca nu-i mai dai credit atat de mult.

Valutazione offerte sistemista,ItaliaCareerAdvice,1i9iwnn,2025-01-25 03:51:16,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaCareerAdvice/comments/1i9iwnn/valutazione_offerte_sistemista/,0rk4n,Richiesta Consiglio,"Non ho esperienza nel settore, ho 24 anni e un diploma linguistico. Per 3 anni ho svolto un lavoro non inerente all'informatica, quindi ho deciso di lasciarlo e iniziare un corso in reti e sistemi Linux, grazie al quale ho conseguito la certificazione LPIC-1 e a breve otterrò la CCNA.

Dopo vari colloqui, dovrei ricevere due proposte (entrambe in body rental). In entrambi i casi si tratta di un ruolo come sistemista Linux (manutenzione, check, SQL, gestione di applicativi server, analisi log, certificati e alcune attività su cloud e OpenShift).

**Azienda A:**

* Piccola realtà con 10/15 dipendenti; lavorerei per uno dei suoi clienti (una multinazionale italiana) su un progetto per una banca.
* Orario: Lun-Ven, 9-18, senza straordinari (ho parlato con alcuni dipendenti).
* RAL: circa 22k in apprendistato (quindi 22k netti). Per calcolare un netto rapido, si può stimare intorno ai 1.550 € (85% di 22k), che aumenterà negli anni.
* Contratto metalmeccanico, con welfare annuale e buoni pasto giornalieri da 7 euro (quindi 150 al mese).
* Modalità: full remote.

**Azienda B:**

* Azienda più grande (100/150 dipendenti); sede di lavoro presso un ministero (20 minuti a piedi da casa).
* Turni: Lun-Ven 9-18 in ufficio, oppure 11-20 (molto scomodo) in caso di smart working.
* RAL: non ancora confermata, ma dovrebbe arrivare la proposta completa lunedì, presumibilmente nel range di 20/25k. Anche qui è previsto un apprendistato.
* Non è chiaro se il contratto sarà metalmeccanico o commercio.
* Modalità: ibrida (2 giorni da casa, 3 in ufficio).
* Reperibilitá (penso 1 settimana al mese)

Nonostante manchino alcune informazioni su Azienda B, le condizioni sembrano simili.  
Cosa ne pensate? Io probabilmente opterei per il full remote, che mi offre maggiore libertà e la possibilità di tornare più facilmente dai miei in Sardegna."

"Contratto non registrato, cambio lavoro?",ItaliaCareerAdvice,1i9i97z,2025-01-25 03:02:15,4,0.84,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItaliaCareerAdvice/comments/1i9i97z/contratto_non_registrato_cambio_lavoro/,Odd-Friend1293,Richiesta Consiglio,"Ciao a tutti. Sono un giovane fisioterapista neolaureato che è stato “assunto” presso una struttura riabilitativa e lavoro con i pazienti in regime domiciliare. In questo mese ho lavorato 18 ore a sett. e da contratto collettivo che propongono, dovrei prendere sui circa 800 euro netti + un rimborso benzina (ridicolo). Con la scusa di dover passare in struttura a fine mese per portare le cartelle firmate dai pazienti, non mi hanno mai fatto vedere il contratto ( ho chiesto una copia, ma niente..) e neanche fatto firmare, promettendomi di farmelo vedere di persona.
A loro ho inviato tutti i documenti necessari e fatta anche la visita medica per il lavoro, ma la mancata firma e registrazione mi fa pensare che al 99% ho lavorato in nero e soprattutto senza copertura inail per eventuale infortunio, cosa molto grave visto che passo le giornate a guidare tra un paziente e un altro. 
Comunque loro promettono poi di aumentare le ore e dovrei prendere sulle 25 ore circa 1150 euro netti. Unico lato positivo è che ho orario flessibile e mi gestisco io il calendario lavorativo.

Ho un’altra proposta lavorativa, una Rsa, che è a due passi da casa mia e propone un contratto con 24h a sett. x 850euro netti circa.

Sarebbe molto più comodo però ci vado a perdere a livello economico e lavorerei ore in più, però non ho lo sbattimento di guidare una giornata intera e neanche spenderei 1 euro per la benzina visto che posso raggiungerla facilmente a piedi.
Ho anche anche altre proposte lavorative extra  con squadre di calcio, e credo sia più facile per motivi logistici coniugare il tutto lavorando presso l’Rsa.
L’unica cosa che mi trattiene nel cambiare, come già anticipato prima, è percepire uno stipendio inferiore a parità di ore lavorative svolte.

Cosa mi consigliate? Sinceramente la presa in giro della mancata firma del contratto di questo mese mi ha fatto veramente incazzare e la vorrei far pagare.
