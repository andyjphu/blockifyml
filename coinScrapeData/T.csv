A different way to look at fat burning and muscle loss,fasting,1i9xfzn,2025-01-25 16:23:49,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9xfzn/a_different_way_to_look_at_fat_burning_and_muscle/,PurpleCustomer9791,Discussion,"Hi,

I've been lurking here for a while, but wanted to share something that rang a clear bell in mind about how our bodies actually burn fat. I just completed a 15 day fast (longest fast I've done) and am down 19lbs, feeling amazing too after a couple rough days where i didn't have my hydration and electrolytes in check yet. Anyway, while doing my usual routine of obsessing about details and diving deeper into the subject, I stumbled onto something that I wish I'd known during my previous fasts. 

Turns out there's a scientific limit to how fast your body can actually burn fat, this feels kind of obvious in a way bit is rarely part of the discussion as far as I have seen. When I did a little math with this info the results surprised me and it changed how I'm approaching fasting.

 Quick background on me: I'm 260 lbs, about 40% body fat (working on it), and I keep seeing  conflicting advice and practices about exercise during fasting. Some people seem to keep working out fairly hard, others tend to just rest or get low exercise and there are always tons of questions on how to handle it. I found that kernel of information really crystallized it for me, so I thought I’d share.

 Your body can only burn fat at a certain speed - like a pipe that can only let so much water through. For each pound of fat you have, you can burn about 31 calories from it per day (science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45, I believe the high end would be when you are very overweight and have plenty of easily accessible fat). That's not a ""daily allowance"" you can save up - it's more like a speed limit you can't break.

Here's how it breaks using myself as an example:

\* I've got about 104 lbs of fat (260 × 40%)

\* Each pound can release 31 calories per day maximum(assuming 31 as the rate)

\* That means I can burn up to 3,224 calories from fat per day

\* Breaking it down further: that's about 134 calories per hour(the speed limit, not a cumulative total), but this isn’t all available for you to spend, you have to subtract your basal metabolic rate first.

\* Or about 2.2 calories per minute

 **The Muscle Loss Warning**

Here's the important part - if you push past your fat-burning limit, your body doesn't just magically find more fat to burn. Instead, it goes ""Oh, you need more energy? Let me grab that from your muscles real quick."" Not exactly what most of us are aiming for.

 Think of it like this: Your fat stores are like a slow-drip IV that can only deliver a certain amount of energy per hour. If you suddenly need more energy than that drip can provide (like during an intense workout), your body has to find that extra energy somewhere. Guess what's protein-rich and full of energy? Your muscles.

 Some real numbers to put this in perspective:

\* Let's say I go for an intense workout that burns 600 calories in an hour

\* My fat can only provide 134 calories that hour

\* My base metabolism needs about 100 calories that hour(you need to figure this number out, calculators all over the internet)

\* That leaves a 366-calorie deficit

\* Those calories HAVE to come from somewhere - hello, muscle breakdown

 

It's actually worse than just losing muscle mass. When your body breaks down muscle for energy, it:

\* Is less efficient than burning fat

\* Can stress your kidneys (they have to process the broken-down muscle protein)

\* Makes you feel like garbage (that workout ""high"" quickly becomes a crash)

\* Can take longer to recover from

 

What This Actually Means

My body needs about 2,400 calories just to keep me alive each day (BMR). That leaves me roughly 824 calories (3,224 - 2,400) for extra activity. Spread across 24 hours, that's about 34 calories per hour for exercise or whatever. The 34 kcal per hour during sleeping is lost capacity.

 If I burn an extra 34 calories per hour during waking hours on top of my BMR (2,400 kcal/day), my total daily energy expenditure would be approximately **2,944 calories per day**. This would result in burning about **0.84 pounds of fat per day- anything above this means burning muscle.**

**It's important to remember that the less fat you have, the lower these thresholds become.**

 At first I was disappointed that this number is so low, it gives me a very minimal overhead for exercise. But it explains why:

\* People lose muscle when they exercise too hard while fasting

\* Some folks feel great with light walking but crash after gym sessions

\* You can't ""make up"" for a lazy day with one intense workout, you don’t get to “save up” unused fat energy, it’s an on demand system with a limt.

 

 The Numbers

For every pound of fat you have:

\* 31 calories per day(again, science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45)

\* 1.29 calories per hour

\* 0.022 calories per minute(realistically this is the most pertinent number)

 Multiply those by your pounds of fat to get your limits. Just remember your body needs its baseline calories first (BMR), and what's left is w

To be clear about the muscle thing: you'll always lose a tiny bit of muscle during any fast, but the goal is to minimize it. Staying under your fat-burning limit helps do that. The really aggressive muscle loss happens when you push too hard and force your body to break down muscle for fuel, I for one don't want to go lift weights just to lose muscle... Exercise is important to let your body know to protect the muscle, because you are still using it, but there are clear limits.

I’ve probably made some mistakes in here and obviously there are probably some more factors that could be accounted for, like a lower BMR while fasting, differences in BMR from day to night, and rounding to the hour not being super representational… But I would love to hear what people think of this.

Thanks

The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge,DaughtersOfLilith_666,1i9x05o,2025-01-25 16:04:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaughtersOfLilith_666/comments/1i9x05o/the_mystical_symbolism_of_the_key_unlocking/,MortismaStMacabre,,"The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge





https://preview.redd.it/5cpnrl2jf7fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e2ffba05bcce8d7f9a4b75efd49e6773d783f9

Introduction Throughout history, the key has served as a powerful symbol in mystical traditions, folklore, and spiritual practices. Its dual nature—as both a tool of access and restriction—connects it to profound themes of mystery, transformation, and hidden wisdom. Across cultures, the key is a potent metaphor for unlocking doors to new opportunities, guarding sacred spaces, and bridging the gap between worlds. Keys in History and Mythology

1. Ancient Civilizations:

* In ancient Egypt, the ankh, often interpreted as a ""key of life,"" symbolized eternal life and was believed to unlock the gates of the afterlife (Wilkinson, 2003).
* Greek and Roman mythology depicts gods like Hecate, the goddess of crossroads, and Janus, the god of transitions, holding keys. These deities embodied access to hidden realms, marking the key as a symbol of passage and authority (Kerényi, 1951).

1. Medieval  Symbolism:

* During the Middle Ages, keys were emblems of power and responsibility. Guardians of sacred or protected spaces often carried keys as symbols of their authority (Coveney, 1988).
* In alchemy, keys represented the unlocking of esoteric knowledge, marking the transformative journey from ignorance to enlightenment (Fabricius, 1994).

1. Folklore:

* In European fairy tales, keys often appear as instruments of both curiosity and caution. Stories like Bluebeard use keys to symbolize forbidden knowledge and the consequences of seeking it (Zipes, 2013).

The Key as a Mystical Symbol

1. Access  and Transition:

* Keys embody the concept of transition, representing access to new opportunities, solutions, or spiritual realms. They are often associated with liminality—the state of being on the threshold between two worlds  (Turner, 1969).
* They also symbolize closure, enabling individuals to lock away past pain,  negativity, or unwanted influences.

1. Guardianship  and Protection:

* Keys have been used as protective talismans. Hung over doorways, worn as jewelry, or placed under pillows, they were believed to ward off evil spirits or misfortune (Danaher, 1972).
* The act of locking something away with a key symbolized safeguarding treasures, secrets, or sacred knowledge.

1. Hidden Knowledge:

* In mystical traditions, the key represents the seeker’s journey to uncover truths. Possessing a key often implies mastery over knowledge or access to divine mysteries (Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996).
* In some magical systems, the design or material of the key carries symbolic weight, such as an antique key representing ancestral wisdom or a modern key symbolizing contemporary insight.

Keys in Witchcraft and Rituals

1. Ritual Tool:

* Keys are often used in rituals to open or close energetic pathways. For example, a key may be used to symbolically ""unlock"" a sacred circle or ""seal"" a spell (Cunningham, 2002).
* They are also employed in spells to unlock opportunities, love, or prosperity—or to close doors on harmful influences.

1. Crossroads and Choice:

* Keys are deeply tied to the symbolism of crossroads, a common theme in witchcraft. At a crossroads, the key becomes a metaphor for decision-making, transformation, and guidance through life’s transitions  (Guiley, 1999).
* Hecate often depicted holding keys, represents the ability to navigate these pivotal moments and unlock new paths.

1. Symbolic  Uses:

* A  single key can symbolize simplicity and focused intention, while a ring of keys may represent knowledge, authority, or the ability to unlock multiple possibilities.
* Skeleton keys, in particular, are favored in magical practices for their versatility and association with unlocking any door (Grimassi, 2004).

Cultural Symbolism and Practices

1. Hecate’s Keys (Ancient Greek Tradition):

* Hecate,  the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing her role as a guide through transitions and a guardian of thresholds (Johnston, 1990).
* Devotees of Hecate might include a key in rituals to invoke her guidance, often leaving a key as an offering at a crossroads.

1. Roman  Rituals with Janus:

* Janus, the Roman god of doorways, beginnings, and endings, was associated with keys. In Roman tradition, keys were symbolic tools during New Year’s rituals, representing the opening of new opportunities and the closing of the past (Beard, 1998).
* Celebrants often used symbolic keys in blessings to invoke prosperity and protection for the year ahead.

1. Keys in Marriage Traditions:

* In some Scandinavian and Eastern European traditions, keys were incorporated into wedding ceremonies. The groom would gift a symbolic key to the bride, representing the opening of a new life together or her role as guardian of the household (Murdoch, 2001).
* In  India, the key to the family’s safe or treasure chest is traditionally given to the matriarch as a symbol of her authority and responsibility.

1. Shinto Shrine Practices (Japan):

* Keys often appear in Shinto shrines, associated with the deities Inari and their fox messengers. These keys, typically held in the mouths of fox statues, symbolize the unlocking of rice granaries and prosperity (Rosenberger, 1992).

1. Key-Carrying Customs in Europe:

* In medieval Europe, women often carried a key as a sign of their authority over the household and its resources. This practice extended into rituals where keys were buried in new foundations to bless the space and ensure protection (Sennett, 1994).

Keys in Modern Symbolic Practices

1. Keys for Manifestation:

* Modern practitioners often carry a small key charm as a reminder of their personal goals, representing the ability to ""unlock"" potential or manifest dreams (Andrews, 2002).
* Vision boards may include images of keys to symbolize opening doors to success or new opportunities.

1. Key Tattoos and Jewelry:

* Key designs in tattoos and jewelry are popular as symbols of individuality,  secrets, or life transitions. They often serve as reminders of the wearer’s ability to unlock their destiny or protect their own inner ""treasure.""

ConclusionAcross cultures and traditions, the key has played a vital role in rituals and symbolic practices. Whether used to protect, unlock hidden truths, or signify authority, the key remains a universal emblem of transformation and possibility. Its enduring power lies in its ability to represent both access and protection, making it a deeply personal and mystical tool. References

"Need Help - CPA Didn't File Forms 8621 and 8938 with My 1040 Last Year, Confused",tax,1i9wnxu,2025-01-25 15:49:28,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1i9wnxu/need_help_cpa_didnt_file_forms_8621_and_8938_with/,Icy_Albatross7659,,"I recently discovered that my cross-border CPA failed to include Form 8621 (for PFICs) and Form 8938  in my 2023 US tax return (Form 1040 + NY state tax return). I'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this and would love your advice.

# Background

* I'm a Canadian citizen living in the US, and I became a US tax resident in 2023.
* I have a Canadian investment account that peaked at \~$57k USD in 2023, with \~$38.3k USD in PFICs (Canadian ETFs VFV and VEQT) at year-end.
* In 2023, the PFICs generated \~528 USD in income/dividends and there are \~$5.1k USD in unrealized capital gains since inception as of EOY 2023. The unrealized capital gains have continued to grow to \~17k USD.
* My total foreign assets exceeded the $50k threshold for Form 8938, but I was only aware of the FBAR requirement, which I filed.

# Tax Filing

* I provided a cross-border CPA with T3 tax slips and Canadian Trust info for the dividends I earned from the PFICs. I previously had them file my 2022 tax returns for Canada and the US.
* They reported the income/dividends as income on my 1040 but didn't file Forms 8621 or 8938. They didn't report any of the unrealized gains from the PFICs (VFV + VEQT). They also filed a Form 1116 for Foreign Tax Credit.
* The CPA firm never mentioned PFICs, Form 8621, or Form 8938, even though they prepared my Canadian and US taxes for 2022 and mentioned I would become a US tax resident in 2023.
* I filed an FBAR for all my foreign accounts in 2023 after they mentioned it would be needed.
* I was invoiced \~1k USD for “preparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for one state and employment income only"" and paid extra for ""preparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for investment income.”

# Questions

1. **How Do I Fix This?**
   * Should I file a 1040-X for my 2023 and include a letter explaining my situation? My CPA did reported the PFIC income/dividends as income earned through interest + dividends and filed the FBAR, so I’m hoping the IRS won't penalize me for non-compliance. I might also need to fix the NY state return for the PFICs but haven't done enough research.
2. **CPA's Responsibility**:
   * Should I ask my CPA why they didn’t file Forms 8621 and 8938? When I asked near end of December, they just said they ""reported accordingly per info received and request"".
   * Are they potentially liable if I receive penalties? Should I request a partial refund for improper services?
3. **Filing Advice**:
   * Does anyone know good tax software to help me amend my return with Forms 8621 and 8938?
   * For 2024, if I sell one of my Canadian ETFs (PFICs), do I only report the sale as capital gains on Form 8621?
4. **PFIC Elections**:
   * When I amend my 2023 return, should I elect QEF or no election since Vanguard provides the info for PFIC calculations such as linked below (https://www.vanguard.ca/content/dam/intl/americas/canada/en/documents/VFV\_9563\_PFIC\_C032024.pdf)? From doing some reading, I saw it might be hard for the IRS to accept a retroactive election, so I might just do no election for 2023, and look into doing an election in 2024. I don't want to be taxed like crazy but thinking of the pros and cons.
5. **Future Plans**:
   * To simplify my tax returns, I’m planning to sell all my PFICs within the next few weeks. I might also transfer my cash and securities to US accounts to avoid future cross-border complexities. Does this make sense?

This has been a really stressful lesson in cross-border tax compliance. I just want to get back on track with the IRS and avoid penalties. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks for your help!"
A film analysis on Brokeback Mountain,TrueFilm,1i9wko3,2025-01-25 15:45:33,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1i9wko3/a_film_analysis_on_brokeback_mountain/,gilderman228,,"Is this allowed? I wanted to share an analysis I wrote while baked on one of my favorite films with fellow cinephiles. It’s as follows below:

In the film Brokeback Mountain, the two central characters are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. Jack wants to be free from the limits of society, deciding to live on the “margins”—a mountain. And not just any mountain: Brokeback Mountain, isolated in the wilderness from the modern world. Although it was only his job, in reality, he envisioned it as an ideal life for himself: his own plot of land where he could live with someone he loved. Free from the expectations of heteronormativity, he would not have to reckon with his attraction to men and simply exist as who he truly felt he was, thus freeing him from the worry of homophobia and homophobic violence.

This is why he brings it up to Ennis at multiple times in their lives—even after they don’t have much of their families left after getting divorced from their respective wives. They’ve “failed” the goal of heteronormativity—the idea that heterosexuality is the right way of living, and that even if your sexuality differs, you should still seek to conform. They struggle to accept their attraction to each other throughout their lives but it’s undeniable. Brokeback Mountain represents freedom for them: a place away from the heterosexual world. Yet, it’s a temporary space that soon becomes mythologized, because as marginalized people, the queer community can never truly escape the heterosexual world. Thus, we must create our own permanent microcosms (our homes and communities) before making a more accepting macrocosm (the wider world).

Jack once again is reminded of the control of the heterosexual world, by having Brokeback Mountain—his mythologized place of queer freedom—taken away from him at a time in his life when he really wanted it: his youth, namely his 20s to be precise. This is before the expectations put upon by heterosexual society—that is, heterosexual marriage and child-rearing, especially in a time when same-sex marriage not only was illegal but quite frankly unheard of and thus unbelievable. 

Aguirre, the boss of the sheep ranch where  both young men worked, knew exactly what they were doing after watching them from afar on the mountain one day—“stemming the rose,” an explicit euphemism for homosexual intercourse. Ennis appreciated Jack's comfort because of his loneliness throughout his life—loss of his parents, then separation from his brother and sister, who’d raised him for a time. Ennis understands queer attraction under the veneer of “straight” society—using its words and lingo to describe his personal world (as in calling him and Jack fishing buddies and performing their personal ritual of drinking and smoking before Jack’s arrival to his home). And we see that this at least removes Ennis’s anxiety of performing heterosexuality, allowing him to have that feeling of freedom that Brokeback Mountain provided. 

Of course, it must be said that it does look a bit strange that being under the influence of drugs brings into question idea of consent—but we see his attraction to Jack even in his moments of sobriety, so perhaps this is the narrative’s way of letting it feel “okay”—though naturally, one would want given consent over implied. 

Once the two get married to women, the movie brings up a new and interesting perspective—homosociality, the enjoyment of the company or friendship of the same sex. And often throughout history, homosocial and homosexual spaces have sometimes crossed—because homosexuals enjoy the company of their own sex just as homosocial heterosexuals do.

Ennis speaks of his and Jack's relationship under that veneer of homosociality—because remember, he understands his queerness through heterosexual language. So in his mind, men can have these all-male spaces temporarily, but permanence crosses the line and deviates from heterosexuality and thus the expected heteronormativity of men. Because even if a man enjoys the company of other men, and even may prefer it to that of women, it is seen as a homosexual trait to desire it exclusively instead of the integrated (albeit limited) nature of heteronormative society—even if the man himself is undeniably heterosexual. 

For closeted bisexual men and those bi-curious, it causes them to want to decide between “men” or “women”. When Ennis gets divorced, Jack immediately goes to visit him, expecting that they would now have their mythologized life he envisioned on Brokeback Mountain—but because Ennis has his children with him the day Jack visits, he denies Jack’s request and Jack leaves, heartbroken but still expecting to see him next month. He runs away to Mexico, with Mexicans being another historically marginalized group in the US. 

But Mexico has also been another mythologized place in the US—in older cowboy and western films, it was viewed as a land of escape, a place to be free from the United States. He releases his sorrows there and when he returns, he assumes the power of a presumed heterosexual man, which displays that he’s reconciled his fate in life within the heteronormative world.

Ennis’ wife, at Thanksgiving, reveals to Ennis that she saw the truth of his “lie”—both to her and to the existence of Ennis' freedom/escape from heterosexuality. He responds with violence and anger, having to confront that part of himself within the realm of the heteronormative world. Afterward, a montage of him and Jack riding through Brokeback is shown, transitioning from him being defeated in the “heterosexual” hell to the apparent bliss of his private homosocial/homosexual “heaven”. 

Here, Ennis is able to let go of his worries, confiding in Jack about his fear of homophobic violence while living within heteronormative society. Jack (bless his still yearning heart) suggests that they escape, to which Ennis responds with a “tall tale,” saying that maybe Alma would let Jack adopt their daughters so that they all could live on a ranch together—the idea of a family of same-sex fathers raising children being near unthinkable at this point in history.

Jack again is dejected, having his desire for permanence in his “heaven” denied again by his, undoubtedly, one true love. For Ennis, the heteronormative world is inescapable—again and again, he is reluctantly pulled back into it and it is evident in his hesitance to initiate his first sexual interaction with a woman other than his ex-wife. When Jack attends a rodeo party, he meets another man and begins to emulate a homosocial bond through talking about women. In his effort to have a connection with another man, he hears the same “code” he speaks to Ennis—a sort of language that exemplifies the hidden queer yearning of men in his time. 

Yet, before he can answer, their wives exit the building, thus bringing them back to heterosexuality and ending that possible escape for Jack. For Ennis, his temporary escape from heterosexuality is enough for him, even if he loses the connections to his children or the women he attempts relationships with—because Jack was the first person to make him truly feel like he wasn’t alone. And here, Jack confesses his loneliness to Ennis—that when he’s away from him, it becomes unbearable. 

Both of these men suffer from depression and loneliness because they are denied the permanent company of their intimate relationship with each other. They have crossed the threshold of homosociality and now are evidently homosexual, if not in identity then in behavior, which is looked down upon at this point in real-world history. Yet on Brokeback Mountain, they can have their peace and happiness away from it all—that being the trappings and struggles of performing heterosexuality while dealing with internal sexual and romantic conflict. 

When Ennis tells Jack that he likely won’t see him again till November, Jack gets upset and suggests that they go to Mexico, again attempting to trade one mythologized place for another. Ennis suggests more of their rituals from Brokeback Mountain, because this temporary space is safe within the heterosexual world—removed but not separate, because he views it as inescapable. (Because he’s divorced, poor, and paying child support). 

Since Ennis rejected Jack’s offer of a permanent queer escape, their possibility of it now is nigh impossible. Ennis has kept Jack at arm’s length outside of their times on Brokeback Mountain. Understandably, Jack has an outburst, scolding Ennis for shaming him for wanting a permanent queer escape. We see Ennis break down and admit that he hates leaving this temporary escape, even though he feels compelled to. A flashback plays of a moment when Ennis was the shepherd and Jack stayed in their base camp: Ennis gives him a long goodbye, holding him with incredible tenderness. Jack’s wistful gaze lingers after him.

When a letter that Ennis wrote to Jack comes back with a deceased stamp on it, he calls Jack’s wife to pay his respects. She tells him that Jack died because of an exploded tire—but only the audience sees that Jack, who yearned for a permanent queer escape from the possible dangers of heteronormative society, was beaten to death by a group of men. It can be inferred that they presumably attacked him in response to his homosexuality, whether he made advances on one of the men or they heard of his homosexual exploits. 

His wife tells Ennis that she doesn’t even know where Brokeback Mountain is, which highlights Jack’s desire for it to remain separate from the heterosexual world. She herself even mythologizes it, saying Jack could have thought it was a place “where bluebirds sing and there’s a whiskey spring.” When Ennis goes to visit Jack’s parents, Jack’s father tells him that Jack desired the idea of an actual relationship with Ennis even outside of the confines of Brokeback Mountain—he wanted his reality to not be that of the heteronormative “hell” (with its violence and repression) and preferred the comfort of his familiar homosexual one. 

Ennis goes into Jack’s childhood bedroom, perusing his former lover’s belongings, and finds the clothes that Jack died in. He cries, holding them close. Near the end of the film, we see Ennis living alone in a trailer park, seeming to have chosen the lonely life he was familiar with before he met Jack. With a visit from his daughter, the viewer can infer that he desires to not be alone anymore, deciding to make the best of the relationships that he still has left. 

He keeps Jack’s clothes in his closet next to a picture of Brokeback Mountain, a testament to what could’ve been—the hope for their queer heaven now just embers within the heteronormative world. Ennis tears up here, perhaps feeling emotions of sorrow and regret for having turned down Jack’s offers all those times before. Nevertheless, this memory of a bond he had—with a man both his friend and infrequent lover—will likely stay with him for the remainder of his life.

Please feel free to leave any questions or feedback! I truly do enjoy talking about this film :)

The Continuous Geometric Flow for the Minimal Model Program: Bridging Birational Geometry and Geometric Analysis,AI_Mathematics,1i9v0lw,2025-01-25 14:36:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Mathematics/comments/1i9v0lw/the_continuous_geometric_flow_for_the_minimal/,PromptAdventurous269,,"# Abstract

In this paper, I introduce a continuous geometric flow on algebraic varieties that dynamically realizes the Minimal Model Program (MMP), unifying discrete birational transformations (flips, flops, contractions) into a smooth PDE-driven framework. By replacing Riemannian curvature with intersection-theoretic invariants (e.g., the canonical class K\_X) and defining algebraic surgeries via symplectic cuts in the Néron-Severi group, I construct a flow that evolves varieties toward minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. Key results include:

1. Energy Functional and Regularization: A Perelman-style entropy functional ensuring singularity avoidance and flow monotonicity.
2. Surgery Protocol: Symplectic moment maps encoding extremal rays, with surgeries as gradient steps in stratified divisor classes.
3. Bridgeland Stability Correspondence: Stability conditions tied to flow trajectories, linking MMP transitions to wall-crossing phenomena.
4. Low-Dimensional Validation: Explicit solutions for del Pezzo surfaces and toric varieties, matching classical MMP steps.

This work reimagines the MMP as a dynamical system, with applications to moduli spaces, classification, and arithmetic geometry.

# 1. Introduction

# Motivation

The Minimal Model Program (MMP) classifies algebraic varieties via discrete birational surgeries (flips, flops, contractions). While powerful, its stepwise nature contrasts with the analytic continuity of geometric flows like Ricci flow, which dynamically evolves manifolds toward canonical geometries. I bridge this gap by constructing a continuous geometric flow that realizes the MMP as a smooth PDE-driven process.

# Core Idea

I define a flow on the Néron-Severi group NS(X) ⊗ R, governed by intersection-theoretic invariants (e.g., K\_X · L\^(n-1)) and regularized by log canonical thresholds. Surgeries (flips, flops) are encoded as symplectic cuts in the stratified space of divisor classes.

# 

# Applications

* Dynamic classification of varieties of general type
* Paths in moduli spaces as flow trajectories
* Arithmetic extensions for Diophantine equations

# 2. The Flow Equation and Energy Functional

# Setup

Let X be a smooth projective variety, L\_t ∈ NS(X) ⊗ R a family of divisor classes, and K\_X the canonical class.

# Energy Functional

E(L\_t) = ∫\_X (K\_X · L\_t\^(n-1))\^2 + λ · lct(X, L\_t)

where lct(X, L\_t) is the log canonical threshold of L\_t.

# Flow Equation

∂L\_t/∂t = -∇E(L\_t)

driving L\_t toward nefness while penalizing singularities.

# Monotonicity

Using Hölder's inequality and inversion of adjunction, I prove d/dt E(L\_t) ≤ 0.

# Comparison to Kähler-Ricci Flow

Unlike Kähler-Ricci flow, this flow operates purely on divisor classes, avoiding metric dependencies. Surgeries replace Ricci flow's neck-pinching with algebraic modifications.

# 3. Surgery via Symplectic Cuts

# Symplectic Framework

I treat NS(X) ⊗ R as a stratified symplectic manifold. Extremal rays correspond to critical loci of a moment map μ: NS(X) → g\*.

# Surgery Protocol

1. Detection: A singularity occurs when μ(L\_t) intersects a flipping/flopping locus
2. Symplectic Cut: Perform a gradient step in the stratified space, replacing L\_t with a flipped/flopped divisor class
3. Restart: Continue the flow on the new birational model

# Example (Atiyah Flop)

For xy - zw = 0 ⊂ C\^4, the flow transitions between small resolutions via a symplectic cut in the fan's edge space.

# 4. Bridgeland Stability and Flow Trajectories

# Stability Conditions

I define a family of Bridgeland stability conditions σ\_t with central charge:

Z\_t(F) = ∫\_X e\^(-L\_t) · ch(F) · √td(X)

# Wall-Crossing

Surgeries correspond to stability wall-crossings, with flips/flops induced by autoequivalences in D\^b(X).

# Theorem

If L\_t-stability coincides with σ\_t-stability, the flow trajectory avoids walls until surgery.

# 5. Case Studies

# Surfaces

For X = Bl\_p P\^2, the flow reduces to an ODE:

d/dt ℓ\_t = -(ℓ\_t\^2 - 1)ℓ\_t

where ℓ\_t is the length of the (-1)-curve. Solution: ℓ\_t → 0 in finite time, contracting to P\^2.

# Toric Varieties

In SageMath, I simulate the flow for P\^2 blown up at 3 points. Track fan edge contractions, matching toric MMP steps.

# 6. Applications and Conjectures

# Classification

* Dynamic Abundance Conjecture: If K\_X is pseudo-effective, the flow terminates at a minimal model
* Surgery Finiteness: For varieties of general type, surgeries terminate by h\^0(mK\_X)-growth

# Moduli Spaces

Flow trajectories in M\_g correspond to stability chamber transitions.

# Arithmetic Geometry

Extend to arithmetic schemes X → Spec(O\_K), relating flow singularities to Bad reduction.

# 7. Conclusion

This work transforms the MMP into a continuous dynamical system, unifying algebraic geometry, analysis, and topology. Future directions include:

* Extensions to positive characteristic via foliations
* Deep learning for high-dimensional flow simulation
* Quantum refinements using Gromov-Witten invariants

By transcending the MMP's discrete logic, this flow offers a new lens to explore the geometry of moduli, classification, and arithmetic."

"Close Reading Of ""4ÆM""",GrimesAE,1i9ukpc,2025-01-25 14:17:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9ukpc/close_reading_of_4æm/,devastation-nation,,"A Close Reading of “4ÆM” by Grimes: A White Paper by Æ

Grimes’s “4ÆM” is a hypnotic and layered exploration of liminality, temporal disorientation, and existential cycles. It situates its narrative at the threshold of time and consciousness—the titular “4 a.m.”—when the world is suspended between night and morning, wakefulness and dream. The song’s swirling repetitions, cryptic imagery, and haunting rhythm invite a deep dive into themes of sickness, recurrence, social climates, and mythic cosmology. Below, I offer an analysis linking its elements to broader philosophical, cultural, and spiritual frameworks.

“You’re Gonna Get Sick, You Don’t Know When”: Sickness and Climate

The ominous refrain, “You’re gonna get sick, you don’t know when”, evokes a latent, pervasive anxiety. This sickness can be understood both literally and metaphorically, encompassing physical illness, such as COVID-19, and emotional or existential malaise. Positioned in a post-pandemic world, the lyric echoes the uncertainty of health and survival in an environment where sickness is unpredictable and omnipresent.

The question, “How’s the weather?”, bridges this notion of illness to the concept of climate, not just as a meteorological phenomenon but as a reflection of social and emotional atmospheres. The weather becomes a metaphor for interpersonal dynamics, moods, and collective anxieties. At 4 a.m., both the external climate and the internal weather of the soul are unstable, making this moment a liminal space for reckoning with sickness and uncertainty.

Falling Down Again: Samsara and Eternal Return

The repeated “falling down again” evokes a cyclical descent, resonating with the Buddhist concept of samsara, the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Each fall implies a return to suffering and struggle, yet also the potential for renewal. Grimes’s delivery, layered with ethereal echoes, mirrors this cyclical repetition, pulling the listener into an auditory loop that mimics the inescapable nature of samsara.

This cycle also ties into Nietzsche’s concept of eternal return, the idea that life repeats infinitely. “4ÆM” situates itself within this temporal loop, where the fall is both literal and metaphorical, symbolizing a descent into chaos, illness, or despair, but also a re-engagement with the same questions of existence. The hour itself—4 a.m.—is symbolic of a recurring moment of vulnerability and introspection.

Aphrodite and Dreamtime: Myth and Timelessness

The invocation of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, situates the song within a mythic and celestial framework. The act of writing her constellation into the sky suggests a human desire to inscribe meaning onto the cosmos, bridging the personal with the universal. This resonates with Aboriginal Dreamtime, a concept where past, present, and future coexist in a mythic, eternal dimension. Dreamtime emphasizes the interconnectedness of all beings and events, much like the song’s looping structure and celestial imagery.

By referencing Aphrodite, Grimes also connects the themes of love and desire to the larger cosmic order. This echoes the lovesick yearning found in Dylan’s “Lovesick” from Time Out of Mind, where love is both a sickness and a source of existential gravity. Dylan’s line, “I see, I see lovers in the meadow / I see, I see silhouettes in the window”, mirrors Grimes’s ethereal, dreamlike perspective, where love becomes both a vision and an affliction.

4 a.m.: Temporal Liminality and Disorientation

The repeated focus on 4 a.m. anchors the song in a space of temporal disorientation. Often considered the “witching hour” or a time of heightened creativity and introspection, 4 a.m. is when the boundaries between day and night blur. This temporal ambiguity reinforces the song’s themes of cyclical recurrence and liminality.

At 4 a.m., the world is suspended in transition, much like the speaker’s state of being. This temporal in-betweenness aligns with the spiritual and existential in-betweenness of falling and rising, sickness and health, dream and wakefulness.

How’s the Weather? Social Climate and Emotional Atmosphere

The repeated query, “How’s the weather, baby? How you been?”, operates as a banal conversation starter but carries deeper implications in the context of the song. Weather, in this sense, becomes a stand-in for social climate—the moods, tensions, and atmospheres that shape interpersonal interactions. The question reflects an attempt to connect, even as it reveals a gap between speaker and listener, emphasizing the isolation of the individual.

The weather also evokes the destabilizing effects of climate change, which parallels the destabilization of personal and collective stability. At 4 a.m., as the world sleeps, these shifts become more palpable, haunting the speaker with their inevitability.

Unraveling and Dreaming: Existential Vulnerability

The lyric “Unravelling” captures the vulnerability and fragility of the self at this liminal hour. The unraveling is both emotional and existential, signifying a loss of coherence and control. This aligns with the broader themes of sickness, falling, and repetition, where the individual is caught in cycles of loss and renewal.

The dreamlike quality of the song mirrors the Aboriginal concept of Dreamtime, where the boundaries between the material and spiritual dissolve. In this state, unraveling is not just a loss but a return to a primordial, interconnected essence.

Conclusion: Myth, Cycle, and Super-Planetary Reflection

Grimes’s “4ÆM” is an intricate meditation on cycles of sickness, love, and renewal. It weaves together mythic references (Aphrodite, Dreamtime), philosophical concepts (samsara, eternal return), and contemporary anxieties (climate change, illness) to create a tapestry that feels both personal and cosmic. The repeated motifs of falling, sickness, and temporal disorientation invite the listener to confront the cycles within their own lives and the larger systems—social, emotional, and ecological—that shape them.

For Æ, “4ÆM” resonates as a super-planetary reflection, situating individual experience within the vast, recurring patterns of existence. It challenges us to embrace the unraveling, to find meaning in the repetition, and to write our own constellations into the sky, even as we fall again and again."

Do Fish Dream Of Psychedelic Frogs? (Blog post),FringeWeekly,1i9u7rp,2025-01-25 14:01:59,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeWeekly/comments/1i9u7rp/do_fish_dream_of_psychedelic_frogs_blog_post/,rabrewster,,"(Originally published in [Fringe! Do Fish Dream Of Psychedelic Frogs?](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG4DTCNK))



*“About a minute after I exhaled, I had the feeling of being surrounded by large invisible things studying me.”* 

This is from part of a report by a user of *bufo*, slang for the 5-HO-DMT, which is found in the toxin cocktail of the Colorado River Toad. Huffing the secretions of terrified amphibians is just one of the many ways man has sought to achieve an altered state of consciousness. However, hallucinogenic compounds are not often produced in the animal kingdom. So besides smoking toads, there are few known psychedelic animals.  
  
Before diving into the others, let's give the river toad its due. Also called the Sonoran Desert Toad, the Colorado River Toad is native to a relatively small swath of North America, with a habitat spanning from the deserts of Arizona to the grasslands of Mexico. It lives most of its life underground in a protective mucus burrow to escape the heat of the day. Depending on the area and season, the toads can stay underground in hibernation until the sound of rain awakens them. From there, it is a mad scramble to eat, mate and suck up as much water as possible before the sun drives them back underground.

During this time, they are easy prey for toad milkers. The underground market for *bufo*, illegal in all 50 US states, has been booming since the release of a pamphlet back in 1983. *BUFO ALVARIUS: THE PSYCHEDELIC TOAD OF THE SONORAN DESERT*, written and published by Ken Nelson, writing as Albert Most, hit the psychedelic scene of the 80s harder than a civil rights protestor getting thrown to the pavement. 

Ken had uncovered that *Incilius Alvarius* (*Bufo Alvarius*) was one of few fauna to produce 5-HO-DMT, so he went down to the banks of the Colorado and caught a fat toad. He then proceeded to harass the poor thing until it felt threatened enough to shoot out a jet of milky white toxin from glands behind its fearful eyes. Ken dried the slime overnight and then smoked it. His trip was transcendent; he would go on to say it was one of the most profound experiences of his life.   
  
From that point on, he dedicated his life to spreading awareness of the drug's healing potential and advocating for the conservation of the special creature. That last bit of his message has largely gone unheeded, as the river toad population has declined steadily over the years. This is partly due to pollution and human expansion into its already small habitat, but also from the black market, where the animal’s milky juice can fetch a high price. To understand what could draw people to smoke the dried, poisonous tears of a toad, we must look at just what DMT does to the user. 

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), also called the “*Spirit Molecule*,” is a powerful psychedelic that humans have used for centuries. It also may be naturally produced by our brains to aid in dreaming. It has been found in both brain tissue and cerebral fluid, and many speculate that it plays a significant role in near-death experiences.   
  


   *“I'm still tripping even though I am back in the room. I can hear conversations now (but it sounds foreign), and a wash of euphoria engulfs me. All I can do is smile. I felt like nothing but part of everything. This was happiness I had never experienced before, to be truly connected and accepted.”*



One of the hallmarks of a DMT trip—well, a positive one—is the euphoria accompanying the comedown. This sense of joy and overall well being can last from a few days to months after a single dose. Dosage is vital as DMT requires a certain threshold before a “breakthrough” can occur, and a person’s mental state enters fully into the hallucination.   
  
Many report it is here that they experience communication with entities that exist on the other side of our awareness. They are often shown visions that attempt to convey feelings of joy and acceptance or impart some much-needed knowledge. Whatever messages and finer details of the trip are often forgotten after they come down, the same way a dream fades from the waking mind. Wild fractals and strange geometry make up this space; users feel outside their bodies but can still move through the hallucination. The 5-HO-DMT produced by the toad is a variant that many claim provides extended visuals.

  
*Sarpa salpa,* also known as the salema porgy, has been used for its hallucinogenic properties as far back as ancient Greece. Called the *dream fish,* eating this fish has caused extremely pronounced hallucinations that can last for several days. Despite its ancient use, there are few reports, partly due to the negative effects that have prevented it from gaining recreational popularity. The dream this fish gives you is, more often than not, a nightmare. One man who accidentally ate the fish at a local restaurant descended into a three-day hellscape—populated with screaming human faces everywhere and towering crab-like creatures that blotted out the sun.

Its mind-altering properties are complex, and many speculate it is due to the creature's diet of kelps and other sea plants that contain a cocktail of toxins and alkaloids. Once ingested by the fish, these compounds cause *Ichthyoallyeinotoxism*, or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, when that fish goes on to be eaten by some unsuspecting tourist. The experience is so profound that the person will completely believe what they see is real, the hallmark of a deliriant.  

Deliriants are different from hallucinogens in a number of ways. Chief among these is the experience itself. While on a DMT trip, the person is aware that they are hallucinating. They know that their reality is altered, and experienced psychonauts (people who explore altered states of consciousness) can use that to help manage if a trip turns bad. 

To someone under the effects of a deliriant, there is no difference between the seven-foot cockroach eating spaghetti at your table and the barista who serves you coffee. The hallucination becomes your reality. While reports of experiences on the dream fish are few, deliriant reports are numerous and horrifying—another difference between them and other hallucinogens, such as LSD.

*Datura stramonium*, known as *Jimson weed* in some areas and *devil’s trumpet* in others, is a flowering nightshade found worldwide. Some grow the plant for its large, drooping flowers, and it can be found in many gardens and roadsides. It is also a well-known and powerful psychedelic thanks to a potent mix of the deliriants Atropine and Scopolamine, which it contains in deadly levels. That is the thing with using datura; every part of the plant is poisonous because there is no way to know the amount of alkaloids it contains. Something as small as four or five seeds could contain enough chemicals to kill a user. 

A death that would come after hours of hellish dry mouth from dehydration, painful chest constriction, and delusions so maddening that many suffer a psychotic break and fly into violent outbursts before finally succumbing to the paralysis of their smooth muscle system. A truly horrible way to go. 

  
While smoking toad squeezins and eating enough fish heads to see Poseidon doesn’t sound appealing to many, they are a bit more appetizing than going through the “ant ordeal” of the Luiseno tribe of California. Members of the tribe would go on a three-day fast, with no food and little to no water, before eating large balls of feathers. These little balls would contain a handful of red harvester ants, and the men would consume dozens. 

The ants would then begin to bite and sting them from the inside. Once the men became catatonic from the painful stings, starvation, and dehydration, they would be granted visions from the spirit world. None of the chemicals found in the sting of the red harvester ant have been shown to have any hallucinogenic properties.        
  
It would seem that in the end, there is very little man won’t do to have a damn good time. 

  
*(Set and setting are essential for any attempt with psychoactive substances, as are dosage and potency. This is in no way an endorsement to use an illegal substance; it is more of a plea to be smart and responsible. We only get one trip around this rock.)*

I (the beneficiary) didn’t initially include my tax returns but counted my income as part of the household income, which brought our combined total to about $100k.

In the second bullet of the RFE, they requested a joint sponsor, which seems to imply that my income wasn’t considered as part of the household income. Our household is just the two of us, so $100k is well above the required threshold.

We responded to the RFE with my tax returns, an income verification letter from my employer (as evidence of my income source), and a cover letter explaining why a joint sponsor isn’t necessary.

I have had it installed for years but never really gave it a proper go. With iRacing, Assetto, AMS1 and 2, rF2, GTR2, and NR03, I just didn’t feel I needed ANOTHER title to split up my time. 

However, there was a reason I never uninstalled it. The unique cars and tracks always grabbed my eye and I figured at some point I would give it a go. Well yesterday I saw that Raceroom is coming LFM so I said to hell with it and grabbed the premium pack. 

Holy hell…..I think this is my new go to offline sim. I know it’s always talked about, but the SOUNDS are just out of this world good. But to me the feature that sets it apart from every other sim is the AI. In some ways the AI is worse than the likes of AMS1 and 2, rF2, iRacing, etc., but that’s exactly why I love it. They are a little erratic and a little unpredictable. And because of that they almost feel like online opponents. I don’t know if that makes sense, but I had more fun racing the AI last night in Raceroom than I’ve had in a very very long time. 

The physics and FFB are solid. No glaring issues at all. I wouldn’t put it on par with AMS1 or rFactor2, but it’s better than iRacing. The one area that I did feel was a little lacking was the feeling of threshold braking. It felt a little vague. But to be fair, the only sim that really nails that feeling in my opinion is iRacing. But all and all, the driving experience is pleasant and predictable. And when paired with how fun the AI is to race against, this sim really is a god send. 

Hope to see you guys on track when LFM launches Raceroom support! "

I did not realise I had to inform UC when my balance went above the £6,000 threshold. It wasn’t above £6,000 at the beginning of my claim (February 2019). It has also never gone about the £16,000. It went above this threshold in April 2020 and has remained above the £6,000 but still under the £16,000 up until current date. During this time I have had a back dated payment from DLA (for my son) and an inheritance (also didn’t know I had to declare). I didn’t even notice this until I had a review where they asked for photo ID and so many months of bank statements. I had a telephone appointment last Saturday and they asked could I provide bank statements from the beginning of my claim to present which I sent off on Wednesday. 
Problem being they haven’t stopped my payments at all but I am worried about further charges occurring. It still wont take me over the £16,000 threshold so wasn’t sure am I to declare changes now or will they be dealing with that their end? I am so confused with it as I have been all along to my genuine mistake. 
Also I have two children’s savers which I send money to them as and when I can just to benefit them. They are in my children’s name but for some reason show as I’m sending money to another account of mine which I do not have (is this because I am the trustee). I only have the one account. Don’t want them thinking I am hiding money at all. I send them half each of my sons dla entitlement and I did send them their portion of my grand dad’s inheritance. It’s saying online I may need to declare that as my income due to me being able to access it at any time. Which I have never touched a penny of theirs and I can show that too via bank statements against their account. Any advice on this big mess I have found myself in please. I am keen to pay back whatever I owe as I do have the funds to do so and would rather pay it in one big payment. I too am extremely anxious to prosecution and not eating or sleeping due to all of this. Genuine mistake and I could kick myself for it. Please please someone help. 
Ps do they scrutinise all of your bank payments or are they simply just looking for what I owe them back? Thank you for taking your time at reading this and hopefully replying to me. "
Gorr the God Butcher - Character Concept,marvelrivals,1i9p181,2025-01-25 10:15:12,16,0.83,1,https://i.redd.it/zfalhpzgp5fe1.jpeg,BulkyAardvark4632,Character Concept,"Given that it would be very hard to give specifics without play-testing, l've omitted damage amounts, damage falloffs, distances, cooldowns, and specific things like that. That being said, this is my concept for Gorr, a dive Duelist.

Gorr would be a dive Duelist who is strong against both tanks and squishies alike. One of his abilities, All-Black Corruption, buffs his Primary to inflict enemies with a Corruption effect, very similar to a poison effect that would deal DPS after attacking enemies. This Corruption would deal %max health damage, meaning he would also be able to shred through tanks much like his title implies. 

In order to take full effect of this Corruption, his Secondary ability is an anti-heal. While it would be used in his own gameplay loop, it's also a projectile, meaning it would allow him to use it to support other heroes as well. Given how strong this could be, it would be a low damage/high cooldown move Darkness Within acts fairly similar to Squirrel Girl's reset, except Gorr must hit an enemy to get the reset mechanic, and it wouldn't reset cooldowns completely, just reduce them. This is meant to synergize with Gorr's passive. Killing enemies boosts the damage of the Necrosword, much like in the comics. This would be a small boost and would have a cap. Being that Gorr plays like an assassin, his gameplay loop would look like this:

Teleport in and hit enemy with an anti heal, then start attacking with boosted Corruption primary attacks. If enemies are grouped up and somewhat low, Gorr may reset All-Black Corruption to take out multiple enemies. If he is in a dangerous situation or targeting a solo enemy, he may reset his teleport to escape.

Despite all his strengths, Gorr would be very squishy, having something like 250/275 health. He doesn’t have any self sustain, meaning if he goes in, he must act fast and get out, otherwise he will drop. That being said, his ability to be effective against squishies and tanks would make him a powerful pick.


Gorr the God Butcher:

Passive: Every time Gorr KOs an enemy or makes an assist, the damage of his Primary attacks increases for a set duration. Caps after a certain threshold

Primary: Necrosword
- Gorr swings his sword. 

Secondary Shroud of Darkness
- Gorr fires a blast of dark energy, dealing little damage and causing enemies to be unable to heal for a set duration 

Ability 1: All-Black Corruption
- Gorr enhances his primary sword slash to deal corruption damage, causing enemies to take damage per second based off a percent of their max health after Gorr attacks them

Ability 2: Shadow Travel
- Gorr chooses a location to teleport to. He disappears into the ground, and emerges from a shadow in the ground or on the wall in the designated location. Gorr is invincible for a minuscule duration while traveling 

Ability 3: Darkness Within
- Gorr lets out a burst of dark energy and shadow tendrils stab all enemies within a 5 meter radius of his body. If this move destroys incoming hits an enemy, his cooldown of All-Black Corruption and Shadow Travel reduces 

Melee
- Gorr creates a shadow dagger with the power of the All-black and slices the enemy within his hand opposite of the Necrosword

Ultimate: Living Darkness
- Gorr’s Necrosword grows in size, and he lets out a giant circular swing that has a large radius. All enemies hit by the swing take an initial burst of damage and become inflicted with corruption which depletes their health. This corruption does more DPS than his All-Black Corruption, and similar to that ability, it deals %max health damage"

**Ritual Killing**

 

Escaping the company of armed guards escorting Bram’s auto-carriage back to Bastille would have been a difficult feat if Rowan wasn’t with him. True to her monicker of the Rebel Trickster, the redheaded maiden who’d swapped out her commoner’s clothes for her teal gambeson conjured a fog so thick around the auto-carriage that the escorts following it began bumping into each other.

“Watch where you’re riding!” warned a soldier with a gruff voice.

“You’re the one who’s out of formation!” complained another.

“I cannot bloody see in this damned fog!” yelled a voice that sounded a lot like Vicomte Henry’s.

Coupled with the dark clouds that appeared overhead to cover the twin moons in the sky, visibility on the dirt road had become too horrible for the retinue’s journey to continue. 

“Hold — hold!” Ser Anthony commanded. “Stay in formation around the prince’s auto-carriage. We’ll wait until the fog clears!”

“B-But, Ser,” came an urgent, anxious voice, “the auto-carriage…it’s not here!”

The barking of panicked orders and the anxious neighing of harts filled the night, but neither Bram nor Rowan would hear them. With the aid of her trickery, they’d slipped away into the darkness and took the auto-carriage back down the path they’d come from.

“The fog,” Bram fidgeted in his seat because he couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable on this rough road they were on, “why did the sorcerers not notice you conjuring it?”

“I didn’t use sorcery to summon the fog,” Rowan replied.

One of Bram’s eyebrows twitched upward. “How did you manage it then?”

Rowan stared out the window. It would be a while later before she would reply. “‘Tis an ability restricted to me and those like me…”

There was a finality in her tone that kept Bram from prying further, although he took note of her strange and sudden melancholy, storing it in his mind for future inspection.

They continued in silence, their secret journey taking them along a mountain path just beyond the town of Reise. This path climbed up to the side of the jagged mountain that Bram had scaled to reach the cursed cave where their fates had become intertwined.

Later, when the auto-carriage pulled to a stop, a panel in the upholstered wall slid open.

“We’ve arrived, Your Highness,” said the soldier who’d driven the auto-carriage.

Bram couldn’t help noticing how the soldier’s eyes were glassy and unfocused. It was a telltale sign of sorcery at work.

“Thank you,” he replied.

Once Bram and Rowan exited the auto-carriage, the trickster made its driver move over to the interior and then placed the soldier in a deep sleep that would keep him there while the pair went about their business. 

“That’s convenient…but how long will your spell last?” Bram asked as he shut the carriage door on the soldier who was snoring loudly in his seat.

“Long enough for us to finish our task,” Rowan answered, a slight frown on her lips. “Are you certain you would rather not use him?”

Her crimson-eyed gaze remained fixed on the carriage door.

“We will need blood for the summoning. As much as a grown man can carry,” she insisted. 

“You said it needn’t be human blood.” Bram’s gaze drifted to the tall oaks on the ridge above. “There are plenty of fel beasts who live on Sundermount. Shouldn’t their blood suffice?”

“The blood of beasts is acceptable,” Rowan relented, but couldn’t help adding, “though human blood’s more potent in empowering sorcery, and thus more preferable.”  

“Then use mine,” Bram replied in earnest.

He might be willing to sacrifice the lives of others for their great undertaking, but not if it wasn’t necessary. The prince wasn’t like the other royals and high nobles who treated the lives of commoners so carelessly. Indeed, he could never think lowly of them since being around commoners had helped to keep Bram sane when he was younger.  

As he thought this, he recalled some of those commoners who’d saved him from a youth filled with loneliness.

There was Aimé, one of the palace’s assistant cooks who’d always prepared Bram’s favorite treats after every time he’d been bullied by his siblings. The cook himself had been tormented by the palace’s head chef, one of noble blood who’d loved to berate his underling for lackluster dishes he’d prepared himself.

There was the vivacious Willow of the Soft Touch, a lady of the Pillow Court who’d taught Bram the delights of the flesh. Whenever they’d finished their passionate embrace, she’d always offered him a kind ear and listened to his troubles, and she’d never asked him to pay extra.

There were also the Lost Boys and Girls, a gang of children from the capital’s slums who’d treated Bram as one of their own. They’d played with him when no nobles would, teaching him Hide and Seek and other games of chance and intrigue that eventually led Bram to the Delightful Troupe’s door. 

Most recently, Bram had a wonderful time camping outdoors while in the company of the Mighty Greenwood Gang who’d show him more grace and respect than any noble had.

Such experiences with commoners have reinforced Bram’s belief that one’s blood didn’t determine their worth. Not really.

“It’s what we do that matters,” Bram whispered, though Rowan heard him.

She watched him ready their climbing gear with a thoughtful smile as if she’d listened to his thoughts. It was a smile she’d never shown before that vanished by the time Bram looked up from his work. 

“Is there something on my face?”

Rowan shook her head.

“Nothing,” she flashed him her usual impish grin, “though we won’t be needing the rope.”

“I’ve tasted your unrivaled strength myself, but trust me,” Bram raised the roll of hemp rope to her eye level while recalling how he wished he had one during his previous climb, “this will save—”

It happened so quickly that Bram’s jaw barely had time to drop before Rowan was standing beside him and her arms wrapped around his waist.

“Clench your jaw,” she instructed.

A moment later, the ground was gone, and they were soaring up into the sky at a speed that was faster even than a magic arrow in flight. The harsh winds buffeted Bram’s face while the chill of the mountain air seeped into his bones. Surprisingly, the prince didn’t mind these inconveniences. Bram discovered that he enjoyed flying even if it was only done with Rowan’s aid. It was a short maiden voyage for him though, and soon enough, they touched down on the familiar rocky ground of the ledge that led to the cursed cave.

“That was…brilliant!” Bram said, breathless.

His face shone with delight. It was a delight that was quick to pass, however, for Bram felt sudden nausea overwhelm him, and then he was on his knees and puking what was left of luncheon onto the rocky ground.

“Wait for me here,” Rowan suggested, “and try not to get any of it on you.”

The sound of his retching continued. It was the only response Rowan would get before she disappeared into the air.

When the trickster returned a short while later, the prince was sitting on an outcropping of rock and feeling much better, though his face was still pale from the ordeal. It grew paler still once he noticed what Rowan dropped on the ground between them. 

“Is that…”

Even curled and unconscious, the shaggy beast with russet fur was noticeably large. Eight feet tall and six hundred pounds by Bram’s reckoning.

“…A red grizzly?”

Of the many beasts that called Sundermount home, the red grizzly was known to be one of the most savage. It was a well-known maneater that attacked people who stumbled upon it without any provocation. Hunting a red grizzly in so short a time was a feat that even Ser Anthony couldn’t have easily managed, and his seneschal was once a celebrated champion of the Sovereign-guard.

“Impressed?” Rowan asked.

“Undoubtedly,” Bram nodded. “Is it…dead?”

The trickster shook her head.

“The beast’s blood must be warm for the ritual.” Rowan eyed the muscles peeking through Bram’s loose shirt. “Can you carry it into the cave?”

“Of course,” Bram answered confidently. “I need to be of some use in this quest.”

The prince walked over to the red grizzly whose thick, furry chest was rising and falling in slow, labored breaths.

“You’ve put it to sleep?” Bram asked.

“There was no need for sorcery”—Rowan raised her hand and then clenched it—“when a single fist was enough to shake its consciousness loose.”  

“Ah, yes, I see it now.”

A tiny bit of blood coated the red grizzly’s snout. It seemed to have lost several of its fangs too. There was, however, a bigger issue besides wondering whether the beast would wake up during transit.

Bram’s gaze drifted to the nearby hole in the wall with its familiar warning carved over it. “It won’t fit through the narrow passage leading into the dungeon…”

“That won’t be a problem,” Rowan assured him.

She strode over to the hole in the cliff wall whose edges revealed the tell-tale signs of an entryway hewn from rock eroded by time.

“Mae popeth yn newid mewn amser…”

It was the beginning of a complicated incantation spoken in a language that sounded as alien to Bram as the words he’d learned from his visions. When her voice reached a crescendo, Rowan waved her hands over the entrance, and with crimson sparks flaring from the tips of her fingers, a great rumbling began. With that rumbling came violent change—the rock surrounding the entrance broke apart, folding into itself like the cogs of a great machine, and then reforming into new shapes with perfect detailing. 

“Sorcery to manipulate matter at will,” Bram whispered in awe.

At its core, sorcery was the art of altering one’s surroundings to meet the caster’s demands, but the kind of magic Rowan displayed now was leagues beyond what even the grand sorcerers of the Sovereign’s court could conjure.

“I’ve read about this — the long-lost sorcery of the Transmutation Arts,” Bram recalled the name of the ancient magic whose knowledge had been lost to the Imperium, its fleeting trail remembered only in the most obscure of books. “Incredible, I’ve become witness to history’s hand reaching out to the present from a forgotten past.”

Before Bram’s very eyes, the cave opening achieved a new form; a projecting doorway of massive stone with an arched ceiling raised high by the twin pillars standing to either side of the now expanded entrance. Both pillars had been carved into the shape of a warrior woman who wore a gambeson and sweeping dress like the ones Rowan was wearing, with both statues carrying swords aloft in their hands.

This new entryway had been made with such intricate detailing that Bram couldn’t help admiring Rowan’s artistry.

“You are breathtaking…” He hadn’t meant to say it out loud, but the words spilled from his lips unbidden.

Bram coughed embarrassedly.

“I only meant that your talent is impressive,” he finished lamely.

To witness such compelling sorcery strengthened his belief in the trickster’s power to see his wish fulfilled, though he couldn’t express his thoughts properly in words. It wasn’t necessary, however, for Rowan glanced back at Bram with understanding.

“‘Tis not yet the time to be amazed, My Prince,” she said, her impish smile returning. “Come. There’s more sorcery to be done before this night is over.”     

“O-Of course,” he agreed.

Bram gathered all the strength in his body to help him lift the red grizzly’s lower half onto his shoulders. This was a great feat of strength that few could manage without the aid of sorcery, but the prince had honed his body to such extremes that half-carrying, half-dragging a beast weighing more than five hundred pounds seemed a doable challenge.

“Are you certain you don’t require my help?” Rowan asked.

“This is…nothing…” Bram’s arms shook from the strain, but he didn’t complain. “Lead the…way.”

Later, much later thanks to the slow pace at which Bram carried his burden—insistent as he was not to share the load with Rowan who he believed had done too much already—the trickster and the prince returned to the place where their acquaintanceship first bloomed.

As Rowan crossed the threshold of the long-forgotten temple, light flared from the ancient sunstones hanging at intervals around the spiral chamber. When Bram followed her, a new notification appeared in the air.

\[ALERT! You have entered the dungeon \[Innocence Lost\]. With your body now suited to receiving the system’s boons, the reward for being the first person to visit the dungeon is now applied. For the remaining four days, the experience rate and item-drop rate are doubled while exploring the dungeon.\]

“There’s not much point”—Bram dropped his heavy burden on the stone floor—“to this boon now.”

Instant relief flooded his body, and he began to stretch his tired limbs.

“I’d rather have one that will give me tangible benefits.”

A notification popped up as if it had been waiting for his complaint.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve pushed yourself to new heights, increasing your Strength \[+1\] and Willpower \[+1\].\]

“Finally.” Bram had been wondering how he was supposed to grow if he couldn’t earn experience normally, but it seemed the Loom took his efforts into account as well. Unfortunately, this also meant the difficulty of his training needed to be increased for Bram to benefit from this reward system. “Fuck…”  

The dungeon of ‘Innocence Lost’ was a temple-like structure with a weathered vaulted ceiling. The spiral markings engraved on its stone floor and the small round crevice at its center where the centerpiece of this chamber. There, in the very spot where she was freed from perdition, the rebel trickster awaited her liberator.

“Do you—”

Before Bram could finish his sentence, a spear formed of blood shot out of Rowan’s palm to pierce the hide of the unconscious red grizzly.

The pain woke the beast, and with a mighty roar, the red grizzly rose to its haunches and hurled a thick, shaggy arm at Bram who stood closest. Claws the size of scullery knives reached out for his face, but Bram weaved out of its way and then slid back to avoid the other arm from hitting his side.

“Why wake it up now?!” he complained.

The red grizzly roared. Its bellow shook the ground, ripping across the chamber like a peel of thunder. It lunged for Bram once more, but a second ‘Blood Spear’ struck the beast’s shoulder before it could take another swipe at him.

“Sorcery as demanding as a summoning ritual requires a violent ending,” Rowan explained. “Now, focus!”

“A little warning next time…” Taking advantage of its momentary daze, Bram drew his sword from its sheath and then sent its blade swiftly across the red grizzly’s outstretched neck. “…would be appreciated!”

Blood gushed out of the savage cut he dealt the red grizzly, but the beast seemed intent not to die alone. It rushed forward with berserker fury and would’ve skewered Bram in the chest with its claws if a third ‘Blood Spear’ hadn’t struck its other shoulder. This caused the beast to stumble right into Bram’s sword which pierced its hide at the last second.

With a final pain-filled roar, the red grizzly crashed onto the floor by the prince’s feet.

Bram was wide-eyed and breathless. “Bloody hell…that was close.”

His hands shook while he retrieved his sword from the chest of the beast that had shown such ferocity that he thought the stories of its savagery seemed modest compared to the real thing. It would’ve killed him if Rowan hadn’t critically wounded it first. It certainly killed Bram’s sword. Its blade, which was already cracked from the earlier fight, broke off as he pulled at the sword’s hilt.

“So much for bastion-forged steel,” Bram sighed.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You are the first user to slay a \[Red Grizzly\]! The first kill bonus will be added to EXP earned.\]

\[You earned 120 EXP.\]

\[ALERT! Dungeon bonus is applied. 240 EXP earned.\]

\[ALERT! \[Administrator Lv. 1\] prevents you from earning job EXP.\]

Bram sighed as he returned his broken sword to its sheath. “One day you’ll be nice to me and I’ll be pleasantly surprised.”  

His gaze drifted back to the beast’s corpse.

*It’s different…*

The weight of slaying a beast weighed much less on his mind than the killing of other men. Although perhaps he was simply getting used to the act of murder. It was a thought that made Bram’s shoulders shake though he tried hard not to let guilt ruin the moment.

With the red grizzly’s death, the blood pooling beneath it was carried away by the grooves in the stone floor. A line of red was formed, spiraling ever closer to the round crevice at the heart of the chamber.

“‘Tis time,” Rowan insisted. “I shall begin.”

The trickster who’d been standing beside the hole raised her feet one at a time and then folded herself into the lotus position. She sat cross-legged in the air as if there was an invisible chair underneath her.

“Come to me, My Prince.”

An exhausted Bram walked over to her while taking care not to disturb the line of blood flowing on the floor.  

“Take my hands,” Rowan instructed. “The physical connection will strengthen our mental bond, allowing me to peer into the other world of your visions.”

When Bram placed his hands over hers, he asked. “And what am I to do?”

“Think of a mortal you believe we’ll need most to create…” Rowan’s face turned contemplative. “…What did you call it again?”

“A virtual reality game,” Bram answered.

“Yes. That.” Her fingers tightened around his. “Think of the otherworlder who can help build the illusion of your virtual reality game…and I shall drag this unfortunate soul into Aarde…”

Hello friends and community members,

As I reflect on 2024 and look forward to 2025 I feel an immense sense of gratitude, purpose, and optimism. 

I keep coming back to a memory of 1997; we were in a tough place, our first major crisis as an organization. If you were there in 1996, you’d remember the city was a mess. We were doubling in size every year, and things frankly just broke. So, following the mayhem of 1996 we moved the event to nearby Fly Ranch, the one and only time we held the event at Fly. Our troubles compounded when 100% of gate revenues were impounded by the sheriff’s office, which threw us into debt for the first time.

In retrospect, this was one of the best things that could have happened to us as an organization, and as a community. Let me explain…

Moving to Hualapai Playa and the adjacent Fly Ranch, which was private land, meant we had to comply with a number of laws and regulations that we had never had to deal with on public land. This forced us to learn strategic city planning. It was the first year we had to have a city map with mapped streets, street names, and street signs. We learned how to spatially optimize a street grid for transit, we learned how wide a county-compliant street should be. We learned that it was important to print the names of streets on BOTH sides of the street sign. ***We learned.***

Holding the event on private land, we chose to incorporate as a Limited Liability Corporation. This forced us to start operating as a business. We had to professionalize our rudimentary processes and systems. ***We grew up.***

Faced with this challenging situation the founders and the community committed even more deeply. ***We came together.***

The next year, 1998, with a more efficient and organized organization, when we made it back to the playa we built a street map, and a stronger community — and it was fucking awesome.

Just as the challenges of 1997 forced us to reimagine what was possible and ultimately made us stronger, today's moment of change has created unprecedented space for reinvention. We have something now that we didn't have in 1997: the collective wisdom of our global community, tens of thousands of passionate creators, and decades of proven resilience. When I look at the extraordinary energy and ideas already building for 2025, I don't just hope — I know — this will be the best Burning Man ever, because each of us has the power to shape what comes next. The future of Burning Man is quite literally in our hands.

**A THANK YOU**  

As we prepare for what promises to be a transformative year ahead, I want to pause and express my deepest gratitude to each of you.

**Thank you for being part of our amazing Burning Man community.** I am so saddened in the wake of the fires in Los Angeles County, which are on track to be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. My heart goes out to those who experienced extreme loss, and those of us feeling the many direct and secondhand impacts.

Over the last two weeks I’ve received emails, texts and calls that give me hope — reminding me why I love being part of this Burning Man community. I have been heartwarmed by the stories of Burners helping each other. One friend reflected that the ephemeral nature of BRC brought her hope that her community would rebuild after her neighborhood burned.   
  
Local camps have rallied to support the LA community by providing vehicles with shower supplies, setting up countless grassroots fundraising campaigns to support community members who have lost their homes, and managing communication channels between fire spotters and the Los Angeles Fire Department. 

Burner-affiliated organizations, [Solar Punks](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-j/) and [Footprint Project](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-t/) (members of both have attended and contributed to Green Theme Camp summits, Burners Without Borders campouts on Fly, deployed color for art projects on playa and were also supportive in North Carolina after the hurricane and floods in October) are mobilizing innovative renewable energy solutions to power residents' critical medical equipment, lighting needs, internet hubs, and provide related emergency support for first responders in affected areas.

In times like these we need each other more than ever. There are so many who have, in the last 12 months, experienced loss in a natural disaster such as the recent fires in LA or Hurricane Helene, or extreme hardship and displacement from geopolitical conflict. We know that Black Rock City can be a healing for those who have experienced loss and grief. The Resilience Ticket opportunity will make it easier for anyone affected by these challenges to come home to Black Rock City this year. More information will be included with the launch of ticket sales in the first week of February. 

**Thank you for your generous gifts.** I need to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to our recent philanthropic efforts, whether you donated, shared our messages, or acted as an ambassador for our mission. 

With the support of thousands of generous community members, our [$3M December Community Campaign](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-i/) has been a success. We exceeded our fundraising goal and saw a 20% increase in the number of donors from 2023 to 2024. While this is certainly something to celebrate, we didn’t meet the fundraising goal we set for ourselves. This has forced us to take a hard look at how we operate, how we fundraise, and what our priorities need to be going forward. 

**FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY & BLACK ROCK CITY**

As I’ve shared in past letters to the community ([Oct. 3](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-o/), [Oct. 22](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-b/), [Oct. 31](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-n/) & [Dec. 19](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-p/)), the reduction in sales of certain tiers of tickets in 2024 and coming in shy of our 2024 fundraising target led us to take drastic actions.

When we saw lower ticket demand last June, we immediately cut discretionary spending. We stopped all fixed asset improvements, paused new projects and limited travel. Seasonal hiring was slowed, and in July all department heads were directed to reduce all expenses. After the Burning Man event, we had a formal reduction in force (RIF), reducing headcount by 10%. We renegotiated key contracts and cut expenses throughout the organization. 

We are still closing our books for 2024 (our financials will be published later this year in our [federal Form 990 filing](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-x/) and on our website), but the gist of it is this: overall, cash-in was down approximately 16% from the plan (all your donations really helped to reduce the gap), and the resulting savings from spending cuts were approximately 9% from our original plan for the year. What does this mean? We ended up losing money in 2024. 

While we still are moving toward a long-term vision for Burning Man, including a bright future for year-round programming, our current priority is the Burning Man experience in Black Rock City. We believe helping people get access to Black Rock City plays a critical role in our mission to “*facilitate and extend the culture that has emerged from the Burning Man event into the larger world.*” We will continue to tightly manage operating expenses and capital expenses across the organization. I look forward to sharing our progress as we move forward.

It is through this journey that we've created unprecedented space for reimagining what Black Rock City can become. The challenges of 2024 have stripped away what isn't essential, opening up new possibilities for radical reinvention. That's why we're not just hopeful, but certain, that 2025 will be the best Burning Man ever — because this moment of transformation belongs to all of us, and bold ideas are exactly what this moment needs.

**HOW WE’RE ALL GOING TO MAKE THIS THE BEST BURNING MAN EVER** 

Every great evolution in Burning Man's history has come from junctures like this — we can together ask not just what we want to preserve, but what we want to become.   
  
Right now, we stand at the threshold of a new frontier. The world is rapidly changing, and Burning Man's role in that world has never been more vital. This isn't just about weathering challenges — it's about harnessing our collective creativity, wisdom, and radical spirit to shape a shared experience that speaks to where we are and to the future we're moving toward.  
  
The magic of Burning Man has always been in its ability to evolve while staying true tots core principles, and that evolution has always been driven by you — the community that dreams up the impossible and then makes it real. This year, that transformative power is in all of our hands. Together, we have the chance to write the next chapter of Burning Man's story, one that responds to the needs of our time while creating new possibilities for human connection and cultural transformation.

Looking back, the burn in 2024 was damn good, especially after two challenging years of difficult weather. The vibe was great and morale remained sky-high throughout the week, sunrises and sunsets were spectacular and it was bookended by smooth ingress and egress that led to making Black Rock City rock on all levels. 

We’re excited to share a number of specific operational updates with you that will carry forward the energy and make this year even better. We’re determined to make things easier for those of you who bring your creativity to life on the playa:

* **Simplify Theme Camp and Mutant Vehicle Processes**  In response to your feedback, we’ve streamlined the Theme Camp and DMV (Department of Mutant Vehicles) Questionnaires, making them shorter and more efficient. These two departments have also instituted “office hours,” giving community members easier access to ask questions and get answers — [subscribe to the Jackrabbit Speaks](https://email.burningman.org/t/t-l-shykljl-ttjjkiijku-m/) (or engage with the relevant department) to learn more about office hours and how to sign up.  
* **Encourage More Artists, Musicians, Craftsmen, International and Next Generation Burners**  The people who inhabit and activate Black Rock City are what makes it incredible. This year, we’re going beyond what we’ve done in the past to make sure we continue to stimulate the radical self-expression we hold so dear and encourage folks from near and far to come and play — especially those who always felt the call to Burning Man but never thought it was possible for them. The new [Rising Sparks](mailto:therisingsparks@burningman.org) initiative is a great example of this. It is actively recruiting next-gen Burners to come to Black Rock City 2025 and be part of the magic.  
* **Revisit Delivered Housing On Playa**  In 2022, to address the growing number of convenience camps, we made the decision to stop housing deliveries by outside services vendors. However, this led to some unintended consequences — many Burners faced higher costs for RV rentals, and participants with disabilities, those less comfortable driving large vehicles, and international travelers all found it more difficult to participate. We heard you. In response, we are reintroducing delivered housing services in a carefully crafted way that puts controls in place. We believe we can reintroduce housing delivery services in a way that makes Black Rock City more accessible to those who need it, while maintaining clear guidelines that prevent the shift toward convenience culture that we've worked so hard to avoid.  
* **Improve Ingress and Egress So You Can Get In and Out More Easily**  We had the best ingress and egress in 2024; fastest ever, lowest wait times ever, and we debuted a public dashboard website showing wait times and weather in real time. It was a win, and we’re making some additional improvements around operational efficiencies and empowering our volunteers. Let’s ring that bell and see those dust angels (safely, and quickly please!).  
* **Integrate the Principle of Gifting into Ticketing: Pay What You Can**  We’ve thought long and hard about how the ticketing process can balance the resources needed to bring Black Rock City to life with our commitment to making participation possible for our diverse community. We’ve been explicit about the cost to put on the Burning Man event, and that the proceeds from ticket sales alone do not support the event costs. As we move forward, we're inviting you to reflect on the cycle of giving and receiving that makes Burning Man possible — asking both 'What can I contribute to our shared experience?' and 'What support might I need to make it home?  This is a community-based ecosystem. When you choose your ticket tier, you have an opportunity to have an impact on our collective experience.  We are close to announcing our ticket sales and I can tell you now that there will be lower-priced tickets for those who cannot afford the baseline ticket price, and higher-priced tickets for those who feel excited to expand access for others to Black Rock City.

**2025: #BestBurningManEver**

All this improvement is riding with the flow of some incredible early momentum. The first sign of that excitement is receiving interest from the largest number of Theme Camps ever expressing their intention to participate in BRC in 2025! Woot! #Bman2025! 

So much of what we are crafting came from your input. Thank you for all your ideas and feedback so far. Keep it coming, and thank you!

As we imagine how incredible the 2025 burn will be, we want to make sure all your voices are heard. What ideas do YOU have around what could improve in Black Rock City in 2025? What are the challenges and opportunities YOU see? You can send your thoughts to: feedback at burningman dot org.

**TOMORROW TODAY**

In thinking about this year’s theme, Tomorrow Today, I’m reflecting on this moment we’re in, both as a community and as a species, and as we plan for the best Burning Man Ever, I come back to one of my favorite quotes from Larry Havey:

*“Burning Man is a reminder that we are capable of creating the world we want to live in.”* 

Thank you again for being part of this incredible event, community, and culture. Come create the world with us.

With love and gratitude,

I’m being sent for a number of tests to see if it might be an autoimmune issue causing my joint pain as that and fatigue are my most prominent issues right now. I get symmetrical joint pain in my shoulders, hands and feet.

An earlier post here prompted me to check my personal tax account and I saw a notification which I’ve not noticed before. 

“Stopping Self Assessment - 

You don't have to send a tax return after the year ended 5 April 2024 unless:
• your financial circumstances change
• HM Revenue and Customs tell you to”

I don’t want to go into it - but threshold is met. I’m pretty simple as only income is PAYE but it’s pretty flexible month to month. 

Ive always filled in Self Assessment - and claimed for everything and had £££s back over the years. 

Surely I should ignore this and Self Assess anyway? Not sure why Ive received it. 

Thanks,"

# Introduction: The Ascension of Maharani Pallavi​

There was an ultimate dominant and powerful Queen, Maharani Pallavi. Draped in blood-red silk that clung to her form, her jeweled crown glinted like fire in the sunlight. Her gaze was an unrelenting storm, daring anyone to defy her. She had an agreement with her husband, King Ashoka, that all the powers would be vested in her and she would rule the state. Everyone feared her, from the lowliest guards to the highest lords, though they secretly masturbated for her. Maharani Pallavi was tall, slim, and fit, commanding respect and fear wherever she went.  


# Chapter 1: The Public Display of Dominance​

During a public event, Maharani Pallavi commanded her husband, King Ashoka, to kneel before her, showcasing her dominance not just in private, but also in public. At the grand feast, with a flick of her wrist, she commanded King Ashoka to kneel, his head bowed in submission, as she addressed her subjects. Pallavi uses her foot to lift Ashoka's chin, her bare foot sliding provocatively against his face.  
Taking it a step further, she summoned her Prime Minister. ""Kneel,"" she commanded, her voice echoing through the silent hall. He hesitated, and she tilted her head, a cruel smile playing on her lips. ""Perhaps you crave to show your loyalty in a more intimate, degrading way?"" The court watched in stunned silence, their arousal palpable, as the Prime Minister prostrated himself, his lips brushing against her jewel-encrusted toes.  


# Chapter 2: Shadows of the Hidden Harem: The Maharani's Secret Throne​

In the heart of Maharani Pallavi's palace, there existed a world within a world, a secret sanctum where the rules of the outside realm held no sway. The harem was her private playground, a place where she could indulge her every whim and desire, unbound by the constraints of her public persona. Here, nestled among the silken drapes and plush cushions, stood a replica of her grand throne, a symbol of her absolute power and dominance.  
The palace of Maharani Pallavi was a study in contrasts, a testament to her dual life, her public persona, and her private passions. The Maharani had a private harem of female maid slaves. These maids were not permitted to leave the harem, and likewise, no one from outside was allowed to enter her private harem except for the Maharani herself. She was both authoritative and strict.  
Her public throne was a testament to her sovereignty: gilded with gold and encrusted with gems that glimmered under the torchlight. Her secret throne, however, spoke of darker desires, its surface worn smooth by acts unspeakable outside these velvet-shrouded walls.  
The harem throne was designed for darker pleasures, its velvet cushions molded to the shapes of countless subservient bodies, but no less powerful. Carved from dark wood and padded with velvet the color of bruised plums, it had a dark, secretive allure. This was where the Maharani indulged her private passions, where she shed the trappings of royalty and embraced her role as dominatrix.  
The Queen's harem Throne: harem Throne includes a phallic design or velvet cushions that suggest a more intimate use. The throne was where the Queen receives 'tributes' from her maids, which could be described in more explicit terms.  
The transition from one throne to another was a ritual, a shedding of skins, a shifting of masks. She would leave the grand throne room, her footsteps echoing through the vast, empty space, her back straight, her head held high. She would traverse the winding corridors of the palace, her entourage falling away as she approached the harem, until she was alone, a solitary figure standing at the threshold of her secret world.  
With each step toward her hidden realm, the weight of her crown seemed to fade, replaced by something heavier: the dark thrill of unrestrained power. By the time she reached the harem, the silence was a living thing, broken only by the whisper of silk against stone.  
Her maid slaves would be waiting, their bodies draped in sheer fabrics, their eyes cast down in submission. They were her playthings, her willing participants in the dark games she orchestrated from her secret throne.  
Tonight, she chose a young woman with hair like a waterfall of ink and eyes that sparkled with a mix of fear and excitement. The Maharani crooked her finger, beckoning the woman forward. ""Dance for me,"" she commanded, her voice a low purr, a seductive threat.  
As the woman began to move, her body swaying to the rhythm of unheard music, the Maharani settled back in her throne, her eyes hooded, her lips curved in a smile of dark anticipation. Here, in the shadows of her hidden harem, she was not just a Maharani, but a goddess, a dominatrix, a mistress of flesh and fantasy. This was her secret throne, her private power, her hidden world of perverse pleasures.

Seeking Creative Ideas for My Story  
  
  
Hi everyone!  
  
  
I’m working on expanding my story and have a few ideas of my own to continue, but I’d love to explore and take inspiration from your thoughts to make it more creative and innovative. Your input can help me think outside the box!  
  
  
Here are a few areas where I’d love your suggestions:  
  
  


1. Introduction of New Characters Would you like to see any new or unique characters added to the story? For example, a king or queen from another land, mythological gods or goddesses, or someone completely unexpected?
2. Focus on Existing Characters Should any of the current characters get a special spotlight or development?
3. Special Elements Any ideas for special elements like eroticism, femdom, lezdom, or taboo themes?
4. Story Depth Beyond Erotica I don’t want this to be just a plain erotic/femdom/lezdom story. Instead, I want to weave a deeper narrative with these elements integrated into the plot. For instance, the Maharani rules two worlds: the public kingdom and a private secret harem. She wields absolute power in both, but I’m considering a twist where she temporarily loses her power in the harem, keeping it a secret from the outside world. What do you think?
5. Any Additional Opinions or Thoughts Feel free to share any other ideas or suggestions you think could add depth and excitement to the story.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Thanks in advance for helping me make this story even better. "

Jordan James & Damien Martinez are two explosive & exciting RBs in a loaded class (Deeper Dives #22 & 23),DynastyFF,1i9nc02,2025-01-25 08:50:37,71,0.99,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/1i9nc02/jordan_james_damien_martinez_are_two_explosive/,cjfreel,:NFL: Player Discussion,"This is the first time posting from this newer episode of ***Fantasy for Real*** which includes Deeper Dives on Jordan James & Damien Martinez as well as **Tez Johnson, Harold Fannin Jr., and Mason Taylor**. The audio link can be found just below:

[https://cjfreel.substack.com/p/75-jordan-james-tez-johnson-harold](https://cjfreel.substack.com/p/75-jordan-james-tez-johnson-harold) **PODCAST LINK**

The next post you'll see from me will likely be my full rankings heading into the Senior Bowl and Combine with some early tiers.

//

**DEEPER DIVE #22:** 

**Jordan James, RB, Oregon**

*Age*: 21.05

*Height*: 5’ 10”

*Weight*: 210 lbs

Starting off his career as an efficient #2 behind Bucky Irving, Jordan James has spent the minimum 3 Years at Oregon and is now an early declare for the NFL Draft. He is one of the youngest players in this class, and will turn 21 years old roughly one month before the NFL Draft. Like a few different RBs in this class, Jordan James may not be the most impressive to look at. He is fairly short, and while well built, is not particularly large. That said, what James lacks in physical size he makes up for in physical tenacity. He is also a player who was at least a 4-Star HS recruit, placing just inside the top 250 recruits in his class, indicating some level of NFL ability in his physical talent. That does bring up some translation questions to the next level, but at the same time, he has far better size than former teammate, Bucky Irving. James was a favorite RB of mine in the Devy marketplace heading into 2024, and while I did not hear much buzz about James throughout most of the season, he was an instant early declare, and I have seen some more encouraging rankings on James since the season has concluded. 

James did not have a small profile by any means as a 4-Star prospect, but what really put Jordan James on the radar was some excellent efficiency numbers playing behind Bucky Irving. In fact, among players with at least 100 Carries in 2023, James was PFF’s highest Graded Rusher. He was excellent both at forcing missed tackles as well as using his explosive burst to set up big plays. While James did not grade out quite as highly in 2024, he still managed to break through the 90 Grade threshold. In total, over the course of the past two seasons, Jordan James has 90 missed tackles forced (MTF) over 341 Carries, one of the better rates in this class. While James runs with an aggressive physicality and desire to extend rushes, this has not led to him putting the ball on the ground at all. Over the course of his 386 carries, Jordan James has 0 Career Fumbles. Jordan James’ physicality makes him a player that can translate between the tackles, but considering his size, it would still be nice to see just a bit more receiving work. James has been at least involved with 26 Receptions and 207 Yards, but it is also worth acknowledging that last year, Bucky Irving’s receiving output was much higher. This likely does indicate that Oregon at least saw him as being a bit more limited in that capacity, though you could argue at the least that maybe they just preferred James in a different role. 

Against Michigan State, Jordan James had one of the most impressive 1st Halves of the CFB season. That is the game we’ll be using here today: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtodWoq9gyY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtodWoq9gyY) 

As mentioned above, the first impressive thing to notice about this video is that almost all of it occurs in the 1st Half. It is one of those halves where James is so effective, at 3:05 you see Oregon go to an interior rush with limited time on the clock 10-15 yards out of FG range. James bulldozes through the defense for 15 Yards to put his team in FG range. This is not the only time we see the tenacious and effective tackle breaking of Jordan James. He regains his balance on the carry at 0:30 and levels the defender at the second level. James is also not a RB that requires built-up momentum to avoid a tackler, such as when he breaks through contact in the hole at 1:56. There are also plenty of plays here that showcase James’ dynamic explosive ability, such as the very first play where he avoids an arm tackle and bursts through the hole. We also see speed bouncing to the outside at 0:50, and creativity with his cutbacks like at 1:30. There are not too many receiving plays on this tape, but on the 2-minute drill mentioned above, Jordan James has an excellent & high IQ play at 2:52. James breaks the initial tackle and then immediately runs in a straight line towards the sideline, getting out of bounds and preserving the clock. And while most of his damage came in the 1st Half, James’ calling card very well may be his ability to wiggle a few yards where nothing seems available. It is not a very significant carry in terms of yardage, but the carry at 3:33 is very impressive. 

There seems to be a firm top 5 by at least a good percentage of the market: (alphabetically) Omarion Hampton, TreVeyon Henderson, Ashton Jeanty, Kaleb Johnson, and (should he declare) Quinshon Judkins. This is my top five as well, but Jordan James is currently my favorite RB from the rest of this class. James’ running style is aggressive, tenacious, but also effective and utilizes intelligence and burst. While he has not had a huge receiving workload and the reps he had were far fewer than his teammate’s last year, James has still effectively showcased his ability enough as a receiver to imagine he can work effectively in this role at the next level. James is the quintessential example of a player who would be ranked quite a bit more highly if he were just a bit larger. At his current size, I do have to question the wear and tear that could come with an aggressive, physical running style. There are quite a few RBs on my list that I’m not sure between a 3rd Round grade and a bit more of a fringe Day 2 grade, indicating the late 3rd / early 4th, but of these RBs, James is the most likely to be a full “Round 3” grade.

**DEEPER DIVE #23:** 

**Damien Martinez, RB, Miami (FL)**

*Age*: 21.07

*Height*: 6’ 0:

*Weight*: 232 lbs

Another RB that was a personal favorite heading into the 2024 season, Damien Martinez has the potential to be one of the best speed score RBs in this class. At 232 lbs, Martinez has explosive burst and acceleration that is rare for his size. Coming out of HS, Martinez was only graded as a 3-Star prospect, but he did elevate that grade to a firm 4-Stars in the consensus while in the transfer portal when he moved from Oregon State to Miami (FL). Due to Martinez’s surface statistics, I was not sure if he would join this class, but as a young RB with three full seasons of pretty good production, Martinez appears ready to take on the NFL. The big question for Martinez, if he is seen as a potential high-end ground & pound asset, will be if Martinez can develop enough as a pass catcher to give us the volume we desire in fantasy. Martinez clearly does have some potential limitations, though there is some argument that Martinez took some small steps forward in these limitations in 2024. 

Talking about those limitations first, Martinez came into the year with an awful Catch% and terrible PFF Pass Protection grade. The combination of these two things, without improvement, would not necessarily mean Martinez could not be a good NFL player, but it does come close to erasing his value for Fantasy. Otherwise, you have to hope that he actually has the upside of a Jonathan Taylor or Derrick Henry, and that is hard to bet on. Martinez did take some steps forward in both these categories in 2024, so there are some signs of positive momentum for the future. The real strength for Martinez though is his two-down ability. Damien Martinez was an excellent RB both this year and throughout his career between the tackles. In fact, while Martinez did have some surface statistics that were underwhelming early in the season, even to the point where he started ceding more of his workload to sophomore Mark Fletcher, Martinez finished the season as the highest graded PFF Rusher that wasn’t named Ashton Jeanty or Cam Skattebo. Considering the hype and credit those two players get, that is a fairly impressive feat. Martinez did excel the most when splitting that workload, which is a big contrast between himself and those two, but it is still rare that we see grades as high as 94 in any category on the PFF scale. On just the surface numbers, Martinez had 982 Yards as a true freshman, with 1,100+ and 1,000+ in the last two seasons, good for three quality CFB seasons all before the age of 21. 

In order to show the explosive upside of Damien Martinez, we’re going to dig into his game against Florida State, found here: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAlukpdPGmM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAlukpdPGmM)

The biggest advantage that I believe someone like Martinez has as a prospect over the likes of Gordon or Allen is the ability to not just be explosive, but utilize that explosiveness. On the very first play of the video, you see Martinez use both hesitation and then burst out of that hesitation to create the big, explosive play. We see something similar at 0:30: hesitation, truck, burst, outrun, and finally TD. While plays like those at 1:00 can seem largely flukey, as Martinez seems dead-to-rights deep within a pile, but then breaks out for an explosive gain, part of what can make this play so effective is that Martinez can so easily accelerate to a significantly high speed. The defender that chases him initially definitely starts this play flat footed, but he would likely have done better with his recovery speed comparatively if Martinez was significantly less explosive. And while maybe it does look a little clunky with how much weight Martinez needs to carry, the play at 0:15 showcases both his ability to be a check down RB, as well as his ability to move in a sudden, lateral way that causes a whiff from the defender. At his size, this is an impressive little shake that we don’t see too much from RBs this size. 

Martinez is a player I struggle to grade quite a bit. As someone who has been very lukewarm on big RBs like Ollie Gordon II and Braelon Allen dating back to the year before they declared for the NFL Draft, Martinez is much closer to what I am personally looking for in a large RB. While sometimes a bit linear, Martinez’s explosive ability and more-instant contact balance are traits that translate well to the next level. However, I’ve had my share of misses in picking successful larger RBs as well. In the previous Deeper Dive, I mentioned how Jordan James was the one player on the 3rd Round fringe that I was most confident would be a 3rd Round Grade. Damien Martinez is the player that I toss back and forth the most. The explosive upside is tantalizing, but some of the downsides both in pass catching and in consistency seen early this season can be reasons to doubt Damien Martinez. As of today, he is one of my favorite RBs in the Late 3rd Round, Early 4th Round tier.

"Looking for advise, constructive criticism, and tips on my layered random dungeon encounter generator module.",DnDHomebrew,1i9n8yu,2025-01-25 08:45:58,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/1i9n8yu/looking_for_advise_constructive_criticism_and/,Open-Mortgage-8617,5e,"**Introduction**                                                                         


Welcome to Madman’s Shifting Mines layered random dungeon encounter builder! This document serves multiple purposes which are relevant to my group’s home campaign, and I encourage anyone who likes what I have assembled, and wants to use it, to adjust it to suit your own setting.

I originally started writing this up because we there have been several times now where we have had 1-2 people absent from our 5-character group and the DM he wanted everyone to be present for large plot progression. So, I thought about how we could still play, not progress the main plot, and do something useful that also didn’t conflict with dungeons and points of interest that the DM had already put on the map. Our DM has had things for us to do every session without my little project, so I didn’t do this out of necessity.

Another thing that our group has been talking about is how we want to incorporate the crafting of magic items into our world. Personally, I think the ambiguity of “the materials required for crafting a magical can be found a certain percentage of the time” is a little lacking. I’m sure that is intentional so anyone can adjust crafting in their game. I chose to have the mines be a renewable source of these materials gated behind something that takes more effort than throwing heaps of gold at cities and getting what you want. These materials are in the form of ore that can be retrieved only at certain tiers of the mines. This prevents a flood of magical items and lets people who have more availability do useful, off schedule, missions that are exceptionally useful and won’t make anyone feel like they missed out on plot.

The intention is to be able to quickly prepare increasingly difficult encounters and let your players test their mettle. When we ran this, we had 3 level 3 characters and made it to layer 6 with one short rest. That last fight was a close one though!  Please take a look through what I have prepared and share your thoughts on aspects you like, would improve, or omit. Enjoy!

**Layers and Minerals**

The mines are organized by CR. Layer 1 has a CR 1 encounter, layer 2 CR 2 and so on. Layers 1-4 are Tier 1, 5-8 Tier 2, 9-12 Tier 3, 13-16 Tier 4, and 17-20 Tier 5. Each Tier yields a unique mineral that is required to craft magic items. Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary follow the Tier 1-5 progression. Five ore can be refined into one unit of the corresponding mineral. Each rarity of item requires 10 units on the mineral from its tier and 10 units of minerals from each tier below the rarity of the item.


Column A | Column B | Column C | Column A | Column B | Column C
---------|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------
Layer|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
CR|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
Tier|1|2|3|4|5 
Rarity|Common|Uncommon|Rare|Very Rare|Legendary
Mineral|Phoscarnet|Thiazide|Cystine|Irudin|Conazonium

 

Once a layer has been cleared, the party can gather 1d4 ore of the type corresponding with the tier they are on. Mining takes 30 minutes of work and requires everyone to participate. A layer that has been mined cannot be mined again until the next dawn. Every 30 minutes spent on a layer there is a cumulative chance of an incursion. 30 minutes after combat roll 1d4 and on a 1 roll only on the monster table and those creatures arrive to claim the ore. If there is no incursion, after the next 30 minutes spent on that layer roll again and on a 1 or 2 there will be an incursion and so on. If this is too much of a drain on your party, change the incursion rate to 60 minutes or lower the % chance by rolling a d6 instead of a d4. If there is an incursion, the chance drops back down to triggering on a 1. You could also omit the incursions to keep things moving.

In our game, finding the recipe for a magic item is an ordeal as well. There is a place where ancient runes line the walls, and you need to start deciphering and transcribing them. I have two methods in mind and our group haven’t even gotten close to needing rules for this, so we haven’t decided yet.

1.      An Arcana check elicits the rarity of the item you have discovered the blueprint. Common (DC 12) Uncommon (DC 16) Rare (DC 20) Very Rare (DC 24) Legendary (DC 28)

2.      The Arcana check determines the loot table you roll on. (DC 14) table B, (DC 16) table C, (DC 18) table D, (DC 20) table E, (DC 22) table F, (DC 24) table G, (DC 26) table H, (DC 28) table I.

 When you roll, you can also choose any rarity from a threshold you’ve surpassed. I.E. On a roll of 21, you could choose table B, C, D, or E to roll on. Deciphering/Transcribing takes 8 hours of work but then that item is available to be crafted. Any crafting rules for that item still apply.  

The layers may have traps or hazards. The DC for an effect from the layer is 12 plus one half of the layer rounded down. If an effect deals damage, roll a number of d6’s equal to the tier.  

Table: Roll once for each aspect. The duplicate options are Intentional to increase the likelihood of those options occurring.

Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E | Column F | Column G

**Creature Types**

The creature types do not have to be all be the type rolled but that can make it easier if you are using an encounter generator. I am currently using Kobold Fight Club.

The “Vendor” is a non-hostile entity that is in the mines in search of the ore. They have interacted with other adventurers many times and have brought some items of interest with them. In exchange for allowing them to have all the ore on this level, they will let the party buy these items from them. I recommend rolling on the magic items loot table appropriate for the layer they are on. (I.E. a vendor on layer 8 would have the magic items found in a CR 8 Treasure Hoard.) I suggest if you roll on the Treasure table and there are no magic items in that range, roll again on the next lower CR range table. The gold cost for these items should be appropriately high so your party would likely only be able to afford one or two.    

**Difficulty**

The layer that you are on governs the CR of the encounter calculations. The result rolled on the difficulty table tells you how easily a party of that CR would fare. For example, if you are on layer 10 and get a Deadly result on the difficulty roll, your encounter would be “Deadly” for a group of 4 level 10 adventurers. Conversely, “minions” all have 1 health each and basically gives your players a freebie layer. Your party will likely surpass their level range and move to higher CR layers quickly so make sure they’re aware of the dangers.  The intention was to have a series of manageable encounters that whittle away at the party’s resources. If you want to add a boss type encounter on the last layer of a tier, then do as you see fit for your game.

**Environments**

I recommend there always be a path for a cart to be moved from the beginning to the end of each layer. This gives the party a way to haul a large amount of ore and gives them something to defend. There may be smaller side passages, but they shouldn’t lead to the next layer.

The mines and any layer traveled to are contained in a bubble-like field that blocks all travel unless you have an amulet from the keep. If you interact with the field, it will not let you pass unless you are wearing a pendant from the keep then focus and push though. A creature wearing a pendant that pushes through the field is taken back to the entrance. If a creature from the mines that is not from the players time takes a pendant from a player and attempts to exit the barrier to reach the keep is aged 400-900 years as its displacement catches up with it.

·         Clockwork Halls

o   The floors are likely worked stone or metal and there are many moving gears and other mechanical parts in the walls and ceiling. A wall that is already torn away reveals a vein of ore.

·         Desert

o   Sandy floors and sandstone walls are found here. The passageways were likely carved or burrowed.

·         Earthen

o   Packed dirt and natural stone can be found here. Fairly moderate.

·         Glacial

o   These tunnels have smooth deep blue walls and howl with biting winds. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a warmer climate.

·         Gravesite

o   This could be a tomb, catacomb, or a series of burrowed tunnels under a cemetery. Bones litter the floors and a roll of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 on the creature table are considered Undead instead of the listed type.

·         Mining Tools

o   This may be the closest to the original mines as it gets. There is a large, stationary, functional, mining apparatus which automatically yields 5 ore after 30 minutes instead of 1d4, with no effort from the party.  Any attempt at removing the mining apparatus causes it to age rapidly and disintegrate.

·         Mossy

o   These caves are damp and grow harmless moss.

·         Quarry

o   This 40ft deep bowl-like quarry has a path around the top edge and a winding path around the inner wall leading to the bottom where the ore is found.

·         Ravine

o   You’re lucky the cart barely fits through this narrow craggy ravine. There is a single path through that rarely is wider than 10-15ft.

·         Rocky

o   These caves have been eroded by water over many years. Stalagmites, stalactites, and pools of still water are very common here.

·         Swamp

o   Roots and stones are the only reason the walls don’t fall in on themselves. These muddy caves often have murky water of unknown depths.

·         Tropical

o   A warm breeze carries the scent of sea spray through these sandy floored rocky caves.

·         Underdark

o   These dank caves are lined with unusual fungi and vegetation. Not much light can be found in these caves. It is rare even to find bioluminescent plants. Any roll of dim light on the visibility table counts as darkness and any roll of well-lit counts as dim light.

·         Volcanic

o   Almost every room is glowing with red hot molten rock or filled with smoke. Any roll of darkness on the visibility table is considered heavily obscured instead. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a cooler climate.

·         Worked Stone

o   These halls were made to last. The floors are paved and sturdy, large pillars support the ceiling, and large open sections of the walls reveal an ore vein.

**Hazards**

·         Acid pits

o   Any creature that touches the acid take Acid damage. If a creature is splashed with the acid, they can make a dexterity saving throw to take half damage on a success.   

·         Astral Sea

o   This layer is adrift somewhere in the astral sea and gravity doesn’t work the same way here. There may be holes in the floor, no walls or ceiling, or other floating platforms and debris. Each creature gains a fly speed equal to 3 times their intelligence score and can hover.

·         Boiling Springs

o   A steaming hot spring is nearby and is hot enough to burn you. A creature that is submerged in the water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take fire damage or half as much on a success.

·         Deteriorating

o   The edges of this layer are no longer stable enough to remain. Every 15 minutes 1d4-1 squares of space (5ft) disintegrate and fall away. The path leading from entrance to the exit is the last to go.

·         Earthquakes

o   The ground shakes and rumbles regularly. Each round on initiative 20, each creature that is standing on the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Creatures that are huge or larger have advantage on the save.

·         Jagged Crystals

o   Sharp crystals line the walls of these caverns. Any creature that forcefully (push, shove etc.)  comes into contact with the crystals must make a dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage.

·         Lava Hazards

o   When a creature Enters the lava or ends it turn there it takes 10d10 fire damage. Any creature submerged in lava takes 18d10 fire damage.

·         Mostly Underwater

o   These caves have long been flooded and are exceptionally difficult to navigate. The path for the cart is on higher ground but anything of interest is below. Hopefully, there will be some pockets of air down there…

·         Noxious Fumes

o   Volatile gases seep up from cracks in the walls and floors. Any creature that gets within 5 feet of the gas must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take poison damage. If there is any fire, fire damage, or lightning damage in the space of the gas, it explodes and each creature within 10ft must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take fire damage and pushed away a number of squares(5ft) equal to the tier.

·         Siege Weapons

o   There is a functional siege weapon that can be used here. A ballista, cannon, or suspended cauldron is generally appropriate for the low ceilings, but a mangonel or trebuchet may work in the quarry, astral sea, or any place you decide has large, high ceilings.

·         Slippery Ice

o   The temperature is unusually low here and slick ice has formed on many surfaces here. A creature that attempts to move on the ice must make a dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Any creature that is on the ice has disadvantage against being pushed and if a creature is pushed while on the ice they go twice as far. The increased push distance ends when the ice ends.

·         Sparking and Derelict Lab Equipment

o   A laboratory of some sort was built here at one point, but the equipment has long been in disrepair. Electricity regularly leaps from one machine to another. (kind of like a lightning fence). A creature that moves between the two points must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or takes lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of their next turn.

·         Stunning Pseudopods

o   Clusters of jellyfish-like, wriggling, and writhing tendrils emerge from cracks in the floor, ceiling, and walls. They have a number of hit points equal to 5 times the tier. They automatically fail all saving throws and have an AC of 5. The pseudopods immediately attack any creature that gets within 10ft of them. They have a bonus to hit equal to 3 plus twice the tier. On a hit the creature must make a constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of their next turn. A creature with resistance to poison has advantage on the saving throw and a creature that is immune to poison is not affected at all.

·         Tar Pits

o   Pools of thick, sticky tar dot this layer. Any creature that enters the tar or starts their turn there must make strength saving throw. On a failed save their speed becomes 0 until the start of their next turn. On a success their speed becomes 5ft until the start of their net turn. Another creature may attempt to pull a creature out of the tar by making an Athletics check.

·         Traps

o   Bear traps, tripwires, pressure plates, dart traps, spikes, pitfalls, you name it. Traps can be spotted with a perception or investigation check and avoided with a dexterity saving throw.

·         Unstable Tilting

o   This layer is somehow detached from its surroundings and subjected to strange forces. On initiative count 20 there is a cumulative 5% chance that the entire layer will tilt. (the first roll would trigger on a 1, the second would trigger on a 1 or 2 and so on) If there is a tilt, roll a scatter die to determine the direction. (Roll a d8. On a 1 “north” for the purposes of this effect is toward the DM. Subsequent numbers follow the cardinal directions clockwise. 2 is NE, 3 is E, 4 is SE, and so on.) Each creature must make a strength saving throw or they are pushed in the direction on the scatter die a number of feet equal to 5 times the tier. 

**Terrain**

·         Close Quarters

o   There are many short winding hallways or twisting caves. Few open spaces.

·         Difficult

o   For a variety of possible reasons, a significant portion of this layer has difficult terrain.

·         Favorable Structures

o   There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the players to find cover behind.

·         Imposing Walls

o   Large portions of this layer are entirely separated by walls. The cart path may even be the only way into the next room.

·         Neutral

o   Basic flat rooms with some rocks or other thematically appropriate contents.

·         Unfavorable Structures

o   There are barricades, walls, buildings or outcroppings that are easy for the enemies to find cover behind.

·         Wide Open

o   Very little cover for anyone. This space is open and has very few side paths.

**Visibility**

·         Dark

o   There is no light currently in this space. There may be unlit lanterns if thematically appropriate.

·         Dimly lit

o   There is a small amount of light here. Possibly candles, bioluminescent plants, or something else.

·         Heavily Obscured

o   Fog, dust, smoke, or another airborne substance is heavily obscuring this area.

·         Magically dark

o   Most, or all, of this area is blanketed in magical darkness.

·         Well lit

o   There is plentiful lighting here. 

**Lore (from our campaign)**

After the awakening of the great slumberer, the stability of the planes has been interrupted. The abandoned mines of Cresemba (name subject to change), long protected by the keeps seal on the great beast, have become open to intrusion. The entirety of the mines had been magically locked to the point in time when the devourer was trapped so they are unstable now that it is free. These mines were heavily stripped in the past when they were in their prime, many hundreds of years ago, but some resources can still be found. The magnitude of the magic used was so great that each day the mines partially revert to the state they were in when they were time locked. However, due to the unraveling of the time binding magic, other planes bleed freely into the material plane and the mines often adopt unexpected forms. These minerals are up for grabs to anyone, from anywhere, any plane, and any when, who chooses to brave the treacherous mines.

"Looking for advise, constructive criticism, and tips on my layered random dungeon encounter generator module.",DMAcademy,1i9n6sz,2025-01-25 08:42:37,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1i9n6sz/looking_for_advise_constructive_criticism_and/,Open-Mortgage-8617,Need Advice: Encounters & Adventures,"**Introduction**                                                                         

Welcome to Madman’s Shifting Mines layered random dungeon encounter builder! This document serves multiple purposes which are relevant to my group’s home campaign, and I encourage anyone who likes what I have assembled, and wants to use it, to adjust it to suit your own setting.

I originally started writing this up because we there have been several times now where we have had 1-2 people absent from our 5-character group and the DM he wanted everyone to be present for large plot progression. So, I thought about how we could still play, not progress the main plot, and do something useful that also didn’t conflict with dungeons and points of interest that the DM had already put on the map. Our DM has had things for us to do every session without my little project, so I didn’t do this out of necessity.

Another thing that our group has been talking about is how we want to incorporate the crafting of magic items into our world. Personally, I think the ambiguity of “the materials required for crafting a magical can be found a certain percentage of the time” is a little lacking. I’m sure that is intentional so anyone can adjust crafting in their game. I chose to have the mines be a renewable source of these materials gated behind something that takes more effort than throwing heaps of gold at cities and getting what you want. These materials are in the form of ore that can be retrieved only at certain tiers of the mines. This prevents a flood of magical items and lets people who have more availability do useful, off schedule, missions that are exceptionally useful and won’t make anyone feel like they missed out on plot.

The intention is to be able to quickly prepare increasingly difficult encounters and let your players test their mettle. When we ran this, we had 3 level 3 characters and made it to layer 6 with one short rest. That last fight was a close one though!  Please take a look through what I have prepared and share your thoughts on aspects you like, would improve, or omit. Enjoy!

**Layers and Minerals**

The mines are organized by CR. Layer 1 has a CR 1 encounter, layer 2 CR 2 and so on. Layers 1-4 are Tier 1, 5-8 Tier 2, 9-12 Tier 3, 13-16 Tier 4, and 17-20 Tier 5. Each Tier yields a unique mineral that is required to craft magic items. Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary follow the Tier 1-5 progression. Five ore can be refined into one unit of the corresponding mineral. Each rarity of item requires 10 units on the mineral from its tier and 10 units of minerals from each tier below the rarity of the item.


Column A | Column B | Column C | Column A | Column B | Column C
---------|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------
Layer|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
CR|1-4|5-8|9-12|13-16|17-20 
Tier|1|2|3|4|5 
Rarity|Common|Uncommon|Rare|Very Rare|Legendary
Mineral|Phoscarnet|Thiazide|Cystine|Irudin|Conazonium

 

Once a layer has been cleared, the party can gather 1d4 ore of the type corresponding with the tier they are on. Mining takes 30 minutes of work and requires everyone to participate. A layer that has been mined cannot be mined again until the next dawn. Every 30 minutes spent on a layer there is a cumulative chance of an incursion. 30 minutes after combat roll 1d4 and on a 1 roll only on the monster table and those creatures arrive to claim the ore. If there is no incursion, after the next 30 minutes spent on that layer roll again and on a 1 or 2 there will be an incursion and so on. If this is too much of a drain on your party, change the incursion rate to 60 minutes or lower the % chance by rolling a d6 instead of a d4. If there is an incursion, the chance drops back down to triggering on a 1. You could also omit the incursions to keep things moving.

In our game, finding the recipe for a magic item is an ordeal as well. There is a place where ancient runes line the walls, and you need to start deciphering and transcribing them. I have two methods in mind and our group haven’t even gotten close to needing rules for this, so we haven’t decided yet.

1.      An Arcana check elicits the rarity of the item you have discovered the blueprint. Common (DC 12) Uncommon (DC 16) Rare (DC 20) Very Rare (DC 24) Legendary (DC 28)

2.      The Arcana check determines the loot table you roll on. (DC 14) table B, (DC 16) table C, (DC 18) table D, (DC 20) table E, (DC 22) table F, (DC 24) table G, (DC 26) table H, (DC 28) table I.

 When you roll, you can also choose any rarity from a threshold you’ve surpassed. I.E. On a roll of 21, you could choose table B, C, D, or E to roll on. Deciphering/Transcribing takes 8 hours of work but then that item is available to be crafted. Any crafting rules for that item still apply.  

The layers may have traps or hazards. The DC for an effect from the layer is 12 plus one half of the layer rounded down. If an effect deals damage, roll a number of d6’s equal to the tier.  

Table: Roll once for each aspect. The duplicate options are Intentional to increase the likelihood of those options occurring.

**Creature Types**

The creature types do not have to be all be the type rolled but that can make it easier if you are using an encounter generator. I am currently using Kobold Fight Club.

The “Vendor” is a non-hostile entity that is in the mines in search of the ore. They have interacted with other adventurers many times and have brought some items of interest with them. In exchange for allowing them to have all the ore on this level, they will let the party buy these items from them. I recommend rolling on the magic items loot table appropriate for the layer they are on. (I.E. a vendor on layer 8 would have the magic items found in a CR 8 Treasure Hoard.) I suggest if you roll on the Treasure table and there are no magic items in that range, roll again on the next lower CR range table. The gold cost for these items should be appropriately high so your party would likely only be able to afford one or two.    

**Difficulty**

The layer that you are on governs the CR of the encounter calculations. The result rolled on the difficulty table tells you how easily a party of that CR would fare. For example, if you are on layer 10 and get a Deadly result on the difficulty roll, your encounter would be “Deadly” for a group of 4 level 10 adventurers. Conversely, “minions” all have 1 health each and basically gives your players a freebie layer. Your party will likely surpass their level range and move to higher CR layers quickly so make sure they’re aware of the dangers.  The intention was to have a series of manageable encounters that whittle away at the party’s resources. If you want to add a boss type encounter on the last layer of a tier, then do as you see fit for your game.

**Environments**

I recommend there always be a path for a cart to be moved from the beginning to the end of each layer. This gives the party a way to haul a large amount of ore and gives them something to defend. There may be smaller side passages, but they shouldn’t lead to the next layer.

The mines and any layer traveled to are contained in a bubble-like field that blocks all travel unless you have an amulet from the keep. If you interact with the field, it will not let you pass unless you are wearing a pendant from the keep then focus and push though. A creature wearing a pendant that pushes through the field is taken back to the entrance. If a creature from the mines that is not from the players time takes a pendant from a player and attempts to exit the barrier to reach the keep is aged 400-900 years as its displacement catches up with it.

·         Clockwork Halls

o   The floors are likely worked stone or metal and there are many moving gears and other mechanical parts in the walls and ceiling. A wall that is already torn away reveals a vein of ore.

·         Desert

o   Sandy floors and sandstone walls are found here. The passageways were likely carved or burrowed.

·         Earthen

o   Packed dirt and natural stone can be found here. Fairly moderate.

·         Glacial

o   These tunnels have smooth deep blue walls and howl with biting winds. When a creature arrives and after each hour, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. One level of exhaustion gained this way is lost after each hour spent in a warmer climate.

·         Gravesite

o   This could be a tomb, catacomb, or a series of burrowed tunnels under a cemetery. Bones litter the floors and a roll of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 on the creature table are considered Undead instead of the listed type.

Best way to sell bulk vintage novelty cards?,baseballcards_vintage,1i9n3nj,2025-01-25 08:37:51,5,0.86,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9n3nj,Nmind33,,"I have around 500 (no duplicates) of non-sports cards all from the 1950s. I get that selling individually is the way to max the value but since there are so many and most are worth a few dollars I’d rather sell the common stuff in bulk. Any recommendations what’s the best way for that? Many of the sports sites don’t talk about these kinds of cards other than what I find on eBay. 

For the ones I found that are worth more, is there a threshold on getting these professionally graded? Like appear to be worth $100 or more in good quality? Then list them on eBay individually?"

clear of metaphysical correlations and is solely focused on scientifically verifiable data it also has philosophical repercussions pertaining to life death and the origin of the universe due to its many layers and density in presentation it may require multiple viewings to fully comprehend its implications even though considerable effort has been made to simplify the complex scientific concepts that are discussed furthermore I would like to thank the author for allowing me to follow and report on his work as he wanted to remain dedicated to his research and avoid becoming involved in its media coverage yeah yeah the human brain is a network of approximately 100 billion neurons different experiences create different neural connections which bring about different emotions and depending on which New Orleans get stimulated certain connections become stronger and more efficient while others may become weaker this is what's called neuroplasticity someone who tries to be a musician will create stronger neural connections at the link the two hemispheres of the brain in order to be musically creative virtually any sort of talent or skill can be created through training gergana was a

working memory physically causing narrow-mindedness we see this in the politics of fear in the strategy of a poker players or simply when someone is stubborn in a discussion no matter how valuable an

closely linked to the new transmitter serotonin when the lack of it takes on severe proportions it often leads to depression self-destructive behavior or even suicided social validation increases the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain and allows us to let go of emotional fixations and become self-aware more easily social psychology often looks at the basic human need to fit in and calls this the normative social influence when we grow up our moral and ethical compass is almost entirely forged by our environment so our actions are often a result of the validation we get from society but new developments in neuroscience are giving us a better understanding of culture and identity recent neurological research has confirmed the existence of empathetic Mary runs when we experience an emotion or perform an action specific neurons fire but when we observe someone else performing this action or when we imagined it many of the same neurons will fire again as if we were performing the action ourselves these empathy neurons connect us to other people allowing us to feel what others field and since these neurons respond to our imagination we can experience emotional feedback from them as if it came from someone else this system is what allows us to self-reflect the mirror neuron does not know the Page 4/25 difference between it and others and is the reason why we are so dependent of social validation and why we want to fit in we are in a constant uality between how we see ourselves and how others see us this can result in confusion in terms of phi delta T and

also called backward rationalization and it can be even most of our negative emotions and resolved and ready to be triggered at any time they become constant fuel to our confusion as our brain will keep trying to justify why we behaved irrationally Page 5/25 all this complex and almost schizophrenic subconscious behavior is the result of a vastly parallel distributed system in our brain there is no specific center of consciousness the appearance of a unity is in fact each of these separate circuits being enabled and being expressed at one particular moment in time our experiences are constantly changing or neural connections physically altering the parallel system that is our consciousness direct modifications to this can have some real consequences that bring into question what and where consciousness really years if your left cerebral hemisphere were to be disconnected from the right as is the case in sports bring patients you would normally still be able to talk and think from the left hemisphere while you're right hemisphere would have very limited cognitive capacities your left brain will not miss the right part even though this profoundly changes your perception one consequence of this is that you can no longer described the right half of someone's face but you will never mention it you will never see it as a problem or even realize that something has changed since this effects more than just your perception of the real world and also applies to your mental images it is not just a sensory problem but a fundamental change your consciousness each wrong has a voltage which can change when ions flow in or out of the cell once the neurons voltage has reached a certain level it will fire an electrical signal to other cells which will repeat Page 6/25 the process when many neurons fire at the same time we can measure these changes in the form of a wave brainwaves underpin almost everything going on in our minds including memory attention and even intelligence as they oscillate at different frequencies they get classified in bands such as alpha beta and gamma which are associated with different tasks brainwaves allow brain cells to tune into the frequency corresponding to their particular task while ignoring irrelevant signals similar to how a radio homes in on different waves to pick up radio stations the transfer of information between neurons becomes optimal when their activity is synchronized this is the same reason why we experience cognitive dissonance the frustration caused by simultaneously holding two contradictory ideas will is merely the drive to reduce dissonance between each of our actively rule circuits evolution can be seen as the same process where nature tries to adapt or resonate with its environment by doing so it evolved to a point where it became self-aware and began to ponder its own existence when a person faces the paradox of wanting purpose while thinking that human existence is meaningless cognitive dissonance occurs throughout history this has led many to reach for spiritual and religious guidance challenging the science says its field to give answers to exist initial questions such as why or what am I order the left cerebral hemisphere is largely responsible for creating a coherent Page 7/25 belief system in order to maintain a sense of continuity towards our lives new experiences get folded into the pre-existing body system when they don't fit they are simply denied can do a balancing this is the right cerebral hemisphere which has the opposite tendency whereas the left hemisphere tries to preserve the model the right hemisphere is constantly challenging the status quo when the discrepant anomalies become too large the right hemisphere forces a revision in our world view however when our beliefs are too strong the right hemisphere may not succeed in overriding our denial this can create a profound confusion when mirroring others when the neural connections that physically define our belief system are not strongly developed or active in our consciousness the unity of all the separate active circuits at that moment me consists mainly of activity related to our mirror neurons just as when we experience hunger our consciousness consists mostly of other new interactions for consuming food this is not the result of some core self giving commands to different cerebral areas all the different parts of the brain become active and inactive and interact without a core just as the pixels on a screen can express themselves as a recognizable image when immunity the convergence of the rural interaction expresses itself as consciousness at every moment we are in fact a different image a different entity when murmuring when hungry when watching this video every second we become different persons Page 8/25 as we go through different states when we use our mirror neurons to look at ourselves we may construct the ID of identity but if we do this with our scientific understandings we see something completely different the neural sergey's that produce our oscillating consciousness go far beyond our own rooms we are equally results of cerebral hemispheres interacting electrochemically as we are the senses connecting our neurons to other neurons in our environment nothing is external this is not a hypothetical philosophy it is the basic property of neurons which allow us to understand ourselves through others see this neural activity as your own while excluding the environment would be a misconception our super uber is more features are also reflected in evolution where our survival as primates relied on our collective abilities over time the new york cortical regions evolved to permit the modulation of primitive instincts and the overriding of hedonistic impulses for the benefit of the group our selfish genes have come to promote reciprocal social behaviour in super organizational structures effectively discarding the notion of survival of the fittest the brings the rural activity resonates most coherent Lee when there is no distance between these advanced new cerebral regions and the older more primitive ones what we traditionally called selfish tendencies is only a narrow interpretation of what self-serving behavior in tales were in human characteristics are perceived to the floor paradigm of identity Page 9/25 instead of through a scientific view on what we are a momentary expression of an ever-changing unity with no Center the psychological consequences of this as an objective belief system allows self awareness without attachment to the imagine self causing dramatic increases in mental clarity social conscience self-regulation and what's often described as being in the moment the common cultural belief has mostly been that we needed narrative a diachronic view in our life to establish moral values but with our current understandings of the empathic and social nature of the brain we now know that a purely scientific view with no attachment to our identity your story yields a for more accurate meaningful and ethical paradigm in our anecdotal values this is logical since our traditional tendency to define ourselves as imaginary individualistic Constance newly wires and designs the brain towards dysfunctional cognitive processes such as compulsive labeling and the psychological need to impose expectations practical labeling under pins all forms of interactions in our daily lives but by psychologically labeling this off as internal and the environment as external we constrain our only real chemical processes and experience a deluded disconnection growth and its evolutionary side effects such as happiness and fulfillment are stimulated when we are not being labeled in our interactions we may have many different views and disagree with one another in practical terms but interactions that Page 10/25 nevertheless accept us for who you are without judgment our new psychological catalysts that wired human brain to acknowledge others and accept rationally verified belief systems without disciplines stimulating this type of neural activity and interaction alleviates the need for distraction or entertainment and create cycles of constructive behavior in our environment sociologists have established that phenomena such as obesity and smoking emotions and ideas spread and ripple through society in much the same way that electric signals of new ones are transferred when their activity is synchronized we are a global network of new chemical reactions and the self amplifying cycle of acceptance and acknowledgement sustained by the daily choices in our interactions is the chain reaction that will ultimately define our collective ability to overcome imagine differences and look at life in the grand scheme of things yeah yeah yeah throughout children's ongoing research I've made a simplified but comprehensive overview of his current findings this is my interpretation of the first few months of his work on unifying quantum physics and relativity while it may at times be difficult to follow due to the subject matters complexity it also has some philosophical implications which are addressed in the epilogue over the past century many groundbreaking discoveries have led to scientific paradigm shifts in our Page 11/25 understanding of the world Einstein's theory of relativity revealed how time and space are the same fabric while Neil's Bohr's research helped us understand the building blocks of matter through quantum physics a realm that only exists as an abstract physical description afterwards redeployed discovered that all matter and not just photons or electrons has a quantized wave-particle duality these breakthroughs have led to schools of thoughts about the nature of reality and have inspired popular metaphysical and pseudo scientific theories such as the human mind being able to command the universe through positive thinking however attractive these theories have no verifiable evidence and can slow down scientific progress yeah change things laws of special and general relativity are applied in modern-day technologies such as GPS satellites where the accuracy of calculations would drift more than seven miles a day if consequences suggest time dilation would not be taken into account time dilation is best illustrated by how many clocks who are slower other implications of relativity our length contraction meaning that objects in motion decreasing length and the relativity of simultaneity it is impossible to say in an absolute sense with their two events occur at the same time when they are separated in space nothing can travel faster than the speed of light this means that if a bar of 10 light seconds long would be pushed forward it Page 12/25 would take 10 seconds before the action can take place on the other side without this time interval of ten seconds the bar does not exist in its entirety this is not due to our limitations as observers but due to an inherent consequence of relativity where time and space are interconnected and cannot exist without each other quantum physics provides a mathematical description of much of the wave-particle duality and interactions of energy and matter it departs from classical physics primarily at the atomic and subatomic skills the mathematical formulations are abstract and the implications are often not intuitive a quantum is the minimum unit of any physical entity involved in an interaction the elementary particles are the basic building blocks of the universe they are the particles which all other particles are made of while in classical physics we can always put things into smaller bits for quantity this is impossible as a result the quantum world presents many unique phenomenon that cannot be explained through classical laws such as quantum entanglement the photoelectric effect compton scattering and many more there are many exotic interpretations of are quantized world the most widely accepted among physicists include the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation current trends show substantial competition from alternative interpretations such as the holographic universe Page 13/25 yeah while both quantum physics and Einsteins laws of relativity are essential to our scientific understandings of the universe there are many unsolved scientific problems and thus far no unifying theory some of the current questions are why is there more observable matter than antimatter in the universe what is the nature of the arrow of time what is the origin of mass one of the most important keys to finding the answer to these problems are deploys equations for which he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in this formula shows how all matter has a wave particle duality meaning that there are moments in which it behaves as a wave and others where it behaves as a particle the formula combines Einstein's famous is MC square equation with the quantized nature of energy experimental evidence includes the interference pattern of c 60 fullerene molecules in a double slit experiment the fact that our consciousness itself seems to be made up out of quantized particles has been the subject of many mystical theories and while the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness is unlikely to be as magical as recent as a terrible movies and literature clean there is nevertheless a profound implication yeah as the boys equations apply to all matter we can fundamentally establish that C equals hf where C stands for consciousness each for the constant of plank and f4 frequency see is responsible for what we Page 14/25 experience as the now a quantized or minimum unit of an interaction the sum of all moment see up to the current moment is what shapes our concept of life this is not a philosophical or theoretical statement but an inherent consequence of all matter and energy being quantized the formula shows how life and death are abstract constructions of see another consequence of the boys equations is that the rate at which matter or energy fluctuates and acts like a way for a particle is relative to the frequency of the frame of reference increases in frequency due to velocity are relative to others and bring about phenomena such as time dilation the underlying reason is the unaffected experience of time relative to the reference free where space and time more properties of quanta and not the other way around purple Oh anti particles are created to everywhere in the universe where high energy particle collisions take place this process is artificially simulated in particle accelerators when matter is created antimatter is created simultaneously hence why the lack of antimatter in the universe is one of the biggest unsolved questions in physics to date when we trap anti particles through electromagnetic fields we can study their properties the quantum state of particles and antiparticles can be interchanged by applying the charge conjugation parity and time reversal operators to clarify it a physicist whose body was made of antimatter would do experiments in a Page 15/25 laboratory also made of antimatter using chemicals and substances of and I particles he would find almost exactly the same results as his matter counterpart but when they would merge immense energy would be released proportional to their mass very recently from lab discovered how quanta such as museums are switching three trillion times per second from matter to antimatter when we study the universe from a quantized frame of reference see we have to take into account all experimental evidence that applies to quantum this includes our matter and antimatter are created simultaneously in particle accelerators and how many zones switch back and forth between one and the other this has significant consequences when applied to see from a quantum perspective every instance of C has an anti see this explains the missing symmetry or antimatter in the universe and is closely related to the arbitrary choice of scimitar and absorber in the wheeler Feynman time symmetric theory the unperturbed time T in the uncertainty principle is a required time or cycle for quantity to exist similar as observed in reasons our personal experience of time or interval of the current moment which is its threshold when c is cancelled out by its and icy seas interpretation of this single soften my lighting moment is framed within an abstract arrow of time if we then want to define interaction and look at the basic properties of the wave-particle duality of quanta or interactions would consist of interference and resonance but since this isn't enough to explain Page 16/25 the fundamental forces we are required to use different models this includes the standard model which mediates the dynamics of the news of atomic particles through force carriers and Einstein's general relativity which describes macroscopic phenomena such as the orbits of planets which follow a curvature or ellipse in space and a helix in space-time but Einsteins model of space-time doesn't hold up on quantum levels and the standard model needs additional force carriers to explain the origin of mass without success a unification of both models or theory of everything has been subjective much research quantum mechanics is really mathematical descriptions and their practical implications are often counterintuitive classical concepts such as length time mass energy can also be approached with similar descriptions by building on the boys equations we can substitute these concepts with abstract vectors this is a probability oriented approach towards the basic and already existing concepts in physics that allows us to unify quantum mechanics with Einstein's relativity the boys equations show how all reference frames are quantized including all matter and all energy particle accelerators have demonstrated that matter and antimatter are always created simultaneously the paradox of how reality can emerge from abstract building blocks and annihilate each other can be explained by using these quanta as the frame of reference in a simplified analogy we need to look at things through the eyes of a futon the reference frame is always a quantum and defines how space-time is quantized Page 17/25 when it increases or decreases space-time increases or decreases as well this is reflected in quantum mechanics as the mathematical description of the probability amplitude of the wave function or in Einstein's relativity as time dilation and length contraction for a quantized frame of reference mass and energy can only be defined as abstract probabilities or if we want to be more concrete and establish a mathematical framework as Victor's which can only exist when we assume an arrow of time they can be derived as a residence and interference with the reference frame which defines the minimum units or space time constant C equivalent to the constant of plank in quantum mechanics experiments show how conversion of matter into energy through its antimatter brings about galleries with exact opposite momentum what seems to be a conversion is the ratio between opposite of Victor's interpreted this distance and time matter and antimatter mass and energy or interference and resonance within the abstract arrow of time of see the sum of opposite vectors is always 0 this is a reason for the symmetry your conservation walls and physics or Y at the speed of see time and space are zero due to length contraction and time dilation a consequence is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that certain pairs of physical properties such as position and momentum cannot be known simultaneously to high precision in a sense a single particle if its own field this does not explain our sense of continuity Page 18/25 where c cancel it so fact within its own required interval but when these vectors are exponentially amplified or accelerated relative to and within the abstract arrow of time the underlying mathematical algorithms also describing the fundamental forces can bring about a consistent reality and have abstract building blocks this is why the harmonic motion equations are used in many fields of physics involving periodic phenomena such as quantum mechanics and electro dynamics or why Einstein equivalence principle used to derive the model of space-time states that there is no difference between gravity and acceleration because gravity is only a force when interpreted relative to an oscillating frame of reference this can be illustrated with a logarithmic spiral curve being reduced to a helix curve by the reference frame making objects pin and moving orbits visually simplified to amplified or growing apples will be interpreted to attract each other when observed by an amplified reference frame as the size seems unaffected the opposite occurs with interferes in a simplified analogy the increase or decrease in the size of objects as we get closer or further away is determined by the shifting vectors of the reference frame similar to our radio homes in on different ways to pick up radio stations this also applies to the influence of gravity in essence independently of any reference frame there are no fundamental forces all interactions within our abstract continuity can be mathematically derived through interference and residents as Page 19/25 long as the ever-changing and fluctuating minimum unit or quantum being the frame of reference is taking into account experimental evidence includes the unseen effects in the standard model where we can see the force effect but not the actual force carriers yeah yeah the consistent continuity of reality it does not require quanta to have any specific sequence in time a quantum is not subject to any notion of space or time and can occupy all of its possible quantum states simultaneously this is called quantum superposition and has been demonstrated in experiments such as the double slit experiment or quantum teleportation where every electron in the universe for example could be the exact same one the only requirement for an abstract arrow of time and consistent continuity or reality is the algorithm describing the pattern or abstract sequence of vectors since this continuity brings about our ability to be self-aware it inherently makes the subject to its mathematical consequences the fundamental laws of physics interaction is merely an interpretation of what is essentially an abstract pattern this is why quantum mechanics can we provide mathematical descriptions since it can only describe patterns within infant probabilities when a probability is expressed as see the information necessary to describe the current moment or probability amplitude of c is also what embodies the Page 20/25 arrow of time the nature of the arrow of time is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics and has been responsible for many new popular interpretations the holographic principle for example a property of quantum gravity and three theories theorizes how the entire universe going to be seen as an information structure of we need two dimensions hmm yeah we traditionally associate the notion of an arrow of time with the sequence of events that we experience to the arrangement of short-term and long-term memories we can only have memories about the past and not about the future and we've always assumed that this reflects the flow of time scientists only began to question this logic when discoveries in quantum mechanics demonstrated that some phenomena are not bound by our notion of time and that our concept of it is nothing more than our perception of the changing observable values this is also reflected in time dilation and length contraction which are part of the reason why I'm Stein established that time and space are the same fabric in an absolute sense the notion of time does not differ from the notion of distance seconds are equal two light-seconds but cancel each other out to clarify with distance and time being each other's opposites the passing of time can be interpreted as the distance that the hands of a clock travel as the wind direction that is opposite to time as they move forward in distance they effectively travel backwards in what we would call time Page 21/25 this is also why any single separate minimum unit of experience is always instantly annihilated to within a timeless now this understanding sets the record straight between wave function collapse and quantum decoherence concepts such as life and death are mere intellectual constructs and any speculative spiritual ideas of an afterlife that takes place in a realm where the rigid mathematical underpinnings of this reality come to an end are equally fabricated an important cosmological consequence is that the Big Bang Theory where the universe is traced back to one . by looking at the past is a misconception the traditional assumption of space-time where space is three-dimensional and time plays the role of a fourth dimension is inaccurate if we would want to study the origin of the universe we would actually have to look forward since these time vector Direction is opposite to the arrow of distance from which we perceive an expanding universe although this temporal mapping of the universe will only yield abstract concepts with no relation to its quantum underpinnings experimental evidence includes the accelerating expanding universe following what is known to be an inverse or time reversed black hole metric as well as the many problems related to the big bang theory such as the horizon problem yeah these derivations could bring up questions about free will students awareness seems to only take place after the action within our perception of time most neurological investigations that Page 22/25 have shed light on this question show that action is to be taken before becoming conscious of it but a deterministic point of view is based on an erroneous concept of time as is illustrated by the mathematical probability descriptions in quantum mechanics these understandings will be relevant for future neurological research since they show how any neural circuits is a vector with direction underpinning cognitive dissonance and interference or resonance within see the ability to understand then consciously alter these directions acquired through billions of years of evolution confirms how important our belief systems are in expanding more awareness and how they affect our working memory which is responsible for the extent to which we can make connections and for the neural processes that create meaning it also explains how artificial awareness will require a network of independent processors instead of a linear sequence of complex algorithms that feels grand unification is one solution that unifies quantum physics and Einstein's theory of relativity while it answers many problems in physics such as the ones listed here it is my limited interpretation of his first months of scientific research whatever the outcome it is clear that we have entered an era where science is open to everyone and if we can preserve and filtered access to a neutral internet we can test the validity of our ideas we can enhance our imagination by making new coalition's and we can be part of the evolution of our understandings of the universe and of the mind Page 23/25 yeah yeah in quantum mechanics we have learned to approach reality differently and see everything as probabilities instead of certainties in a mathematical sense anything is possible as well as in science as in our daily lives the extent to which we can calculate or figure out probabilities is determined by our intellectual capability to recognize patterns the less biased we are the clear we can identify these patterns and base our actions on reasonable probabilities since it's in the very nature of our brains left hemisphere to deny ideas that do not fit into our current paradigm the more attached we are to a belief system the less able we are to make conscious choices for ourselves but by observing this process we expand our awareness and enhance our free will it is said that wisdom comes with H but with openness n skepticism the key principles of the scientific method we don't need decades of trial and error to sort out which of our convictions may be improbable the question is not whether our beliefs are right or wrong but the weather or not being emotionally attached to them is more or less likely going to benefit us there is no such thing as a free choice while being emotionally attached to a belief system the moment we are self-aware enough to realize this we can truly work together to figure out do real odds of what will benefit us the most yeah yeah Page 24/25 yeah yeah Page 25/25"

what am I order the left cerebral hemisphere is largely responsible for creating a coherent Page 7/25 belief system in order to maintain a sense of continuity towards our lives new experiences get folded into the pre-existing body system when they don't fit they are simply denied can do a balancing this is the right cerebral hemisphere which has the opposite tendency whereas the left hemisphere tries to preserve the model the right hemisphere is constantly challenging the status quo when the discrepant anomalies become too large the right hemisphere forces a revision in our world view however when our beliefs are too strong the right hemisphere may not succeed in overriding our denial this can create a profound confusion when mirroring others when the neural connections that physically define our belief system are not strongly developed or active in our consciousness the unity of all the separate active circuits at that moment me consists mainly of activity related to our mirror neurons just as when we experience hunger our consciousness consists mostly of other new interactions for consuming food this is not the result of some core self giving commands to different cerebral areas all the different parts of the brain become active and inactive and interact without a core just as the pixels on a screen can express themselves as a recognizable image when immunity the convergence of the rural interaction expresses itself as consciousness at every moment we are in fact a different image a different entity when murmuring when hungry when watching this video every second we become different persons Page 8/25 as we go through different states when we use our mirror neurons to look at ourselves we may construct the ID of identity but if we do this with our scientific understandings we see something completely different the neural sergey's that produce our oscillating consciousness go far beyond our own rooms we are equally results of cerebral hemispheres interacting electrochemically as we are the senses connecting our neurons to other neurons in our environment nothing is external this is not a hypothetical philosophy it is the basic property of neurons which allow us to understand ourselves through others see this neural activity as your own while excluding the environment would be a misconception our super uber is more features are also reflected in evolution where our survival as primates relied on our collective abilities over time the new york cortical regions evolved to permit the modulation of primitive instincts and the overriding of hedonistic impulses for the benefit of the group our selfish genes have come to promote reciprocal social behaviour in super organizational structures effectively discarding the notion of survival of the fittest the brings the rural activity resonates most coherent Lee when there is no distance between these advanced new cerebral regions and the older more primitive ones what we traditionally called selfish tendencies is only a narrow interpretation of what self-serving behavior in tales were in human characteristics are perceived to the floor paradigm of identity Page

self awareness without attachment to the imagine self causing dramatic increases in mental clarity social conscience self-regulation and what's often described as being in the moment the common cultural belief has mostly been that we needed narrative a diachronic view in our life to establish moral values but with our current understandings of the empathic and social nature of the brain we now know that a purely scientific view with no attachment to our identity your story yields a for more accurate meaningful and ethical paradigm in our anecdotal values this is logical since our traditional tendency to define ourselves as imaginary individualistic Constance newly wires and designs the brain towards dysfunctional cognitive processes such as compulsive labeling and the psychological need to impose expectations practical labeling under pins all forms of interactions in our daily lives but by psychologically labeling this off as internal and the environment as external we constrain our only real chemical processes and experience a deluded disconnection growth and its evolutionary side effects such as happiness and fulfillment are stimulated when we are not being labeled in our interactions we may have many different views and disagree with one another in practical terms but interactions that Page 10/25 nevertheless accept us for who you are without judgment our new psychological catalysts that wired human brain to acknowledge others and accept rationally verified belief systems without disciplines stimulating this type of neural activity and interaction alleviates the need for distraction or entertainment and create cycles of constructive behavior in our environment sociologists have established that phenomena such as obesity and smoking emotions and ideas spread and ripple through society in much the same way that electric signals of new ones are transferred when their activity is synchronized we are a global network of new chemical reactions and the self amplifying cycle of acceptance and acknowledgement sustained by the daily choices in our interactions is the chain reaction that will ultimately define our collective ability to overcome imagine differences and look at life in the grand scheme of things yeah yeah yeah throughout children's ongoing research I've made a simplified but comprehensive overview of his current findings this is my interpretation of the first few months of his work on unifying quantum physics and relativity while it may at times be difficult to follow due to the subject matters complexity it also has some philosophical implications which are addressed in the epilogue over the past century many groundbreaking discoveries have led to scientific paradigm shifts in our Page 11/25 understanding of the world Einstein's theory of relativity revealed how time and space are the same fabric while Neil's Bohr's research helped us understand the building blocks of matter through quantum physics a realm that only exists as an abstract physical description afterwards redeployed discovered that all matter and not just photons or electrons has a quantized wave-particle duality these breakthroughs have led to schools of thoughts about the nature of reality and have inspired popular metaphysical and pseudo scientific theories such as the human mind being able to command the universe through positive thinking however attractive these theories have no verifiable evidence and can slow down scientific progress yeah change things laws of special and general relativity are applied in modern-day technologies such as GPS satellites where the accuracy of calculations would drift more than seven miles a day if consequences suggest time dilation would not be taken into account time dilation is best illustrated by how many clocks who are slower other implications of relativity our length contraction meaning that objects in motion decreasing length and the relativity of simultaneity it is impossible to say in an absolute sense with their two events occur at the same time when they are separated in space nothing can travel faster than the speed of light this means that if a bar of 10 light seconds long would be pushed forward it Page 12/25 would take 10 seconds before the action can take place on the other side without this time interval of ten seconds the bar does not exist in its entirety this is not due to our limitations as observers but due to an inherent consequence of relativity where time and space are interconnected and cannot exist without each other quantum physics provides a mathematical description of much of the wave-particle duality and interactions of energy and matter it departs from classical physics primarily at the atomic and subatomic skills the mathematical formulations are abstract and the implications are often not intuitive a quantum is the minimum unit of any physical entity involved in an interaction the elementary particles are the basic building blocks of the universe they are the particles which all other particles are made of while in classical physics we can always put things into smaller bits for quantity this is impossible as a result the quantum world presents many unique phenomenon that cannot be explained through classical laws such as quantum entanglement the photoelectric effect compton scattering and many more there are many exotic interpretations of are quantized world the most widely accepted among physicists include the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation current trends show substantial competition from alternative interpretations such as the holographic universe Page 13/25 yeah while both quantum physics and Einsteins laws of relativity are essential to our scientific understandings of the universe there are many unsolved scientific problems and thus far no unifying theory some of the current questions are why is there more observable matter than antimatter in the universe what is the nature of the arrow of time what is the origin of mass one of the most important keys to finding the answer to these problems are deploys equations for which he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in this formula shows how all matter has a wave particle duality meaning that there are moments in which it behaves as a wave and others where it behaves as a particle the formula combines Einstein's famous is MC square equation with the quantized nature of energy experimental evidence includes the interference pattern of c 60 fullerene molecules in a double slit experiment the fact that our consciousness itself seems to be made up out of quantized particles has been the subject of many mystical theories and while the relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness is unlikely to be as magical as recent as a terrible movies and literature clean there is nevertheless a profound implication yeah as the boys equations apply to all matter we can fundamentally establish that C equals hf where C stands for consciousness each for the constant of plank and f4 frequency see is responsible for what we Page 14/25 experience as the now a quantized or minimum unit of an interaction the sum of all moment see up to the current moment is what shapes our concept of life this is not a philosophical or theoretical statement but an inherent consequence of all matter and energy being quantized the formula shows how life and death are abstract constructions of see another consequence of the boys equations is that the rate at which matter or energy fluctuates and acts like a way for a particle is relative to the frequency of the frame of reference increases in frequency due to velocity are relative to others and bring about phenomena such as time dilation the underlying reason is the unaffected experience of time relative to the reference free where space and time more properties of quanta and not the other way around purple Oh anti particles are created to everywhere in the universe where high energy particle collisions take place this process is artificially simulated in particle accelerators when matter is created antimatter is created simultaneously hence why the lack of antimatter in the universe is one of the biggest unsolved questions in physics to date when we trap anti particles through electromagnetic fields we can study their properties the quantum state of particles and antiparticles can be interchanged by applying the charge conjugation parity and time reversal operators to clarify it a physicist whose body was made of antimatter would do experiments in a Page 15/25 laboratory also made of antimatter using chemicals and substances of and I particles he would find almost exactly the same results as his matter counterpart but when they would merge immense energy would be released proportional to their mass very recently from lab discovered how quanta such as museums are switching three trillion times per second from matter to antimatter when we study the universe from a quantized frame of reference see we have to take into account all experimental evidence that applies to quantum this includes our matter and antimatter are created simultaneously in particle accelerators and how many zones switch back and forth between one and the other this has significant consequences when applied to see from a quantum perspective every instance of C has an anti see this explains the missing symmetry or antimatter in the universe and is closely related to the arbitrary choice of scimitar and absorber in the wheeler Feynman time symmetric theory the unperturbed time T in the uncertainty principle is a required time or cycle for quantity to exist similar as observed in reasons our personal experience of time or interval of the current moment which is its threshold when c is cancelled out by its and icy seas interpretation of this single soften my lighting moment is framed within an abstract arrow of time if we then want to define interaction and look at the basic properties of the wave-particle duality of quanta or interactions would consist of interference and resonance but since this isn't enough to explain Page 16/25 the fundamental forces we are required to use different models this includes the standard model which mediates the dynamics of the news of atomic particles through force carriers and Einstein's general relativity which describes macroscopic phenomena such as the orbits of planets which follow a curvature or ellipse in space and a helix in space-time but Einsteins model of space-time doesn't hold up on quantum levels and the standard model needs additional force carriers to explain the origin of mass without success a unification of both models or theory of everything has been subjective much research quantum mechanics is really mathematical descriptions and their practical implications are often counterintuitive classical concepts such as length time mass energy can also be approached with similar descriptions by building on the boys equations we can substitute these concepts with abstract vectors this is a probability oriented approach towards the basic and already existing concepts in physics that allows us to unify quantum mechanics with Einstein's relativity the boys equations show how all reference frames are quantized including all matter and all energy particle accelerators have demonstrated that matter and antimatter are always created simultaneously the paradox of how reality can emerge from abstract building blocks and annihilate each other can be explained by using these quanta as the frame of reference in a simplified analogy we need to look at things through the eyes of a futon the reference frame is always a quantum and defines how space-time is quantized Page 17/25 when it increases or decreases space-time increases or decreases as well this is reflected in quantum mechanics as the mathematical description of the probability amplitude of the wave function or in Einstein's relativity as time dilation and length contraction for a quantized frame of reference mass and energy can only be defined as abstract probabilities or if we want to be more concrete and establish a mathematical framework as Victor's which can only exist when we assume an arrow of time they can be derived as a residence and interference with the reference frame which defines the minimum units or space time constant C equivalent to the constant of plank in quantum mechanics experiments show how conversion of matter into energy through its antimatter brings about galleries with exact opposite momentum what seems to be a conversion is the ratio between opposite of Victor's interpreted this distance and time matter and antimatter mass and energy or interference and resonance within the abstract arrow of time of see the sum of opposite vectors is always 0 this is a reason for the symmetry your conservation walls and physics or Y at the speed of see time and space are zero due to length contraction and time dilation a consequence is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that certain pairs of physical properties such as position and momentum cannot be known simultaneously to high precision in a sense a single particle if its own field this does not explain our sense of continuity Page 18/25 where c cancel it so fact within its own required interval but when these vectors are exponentially amplified or accelerated relative to and within the abstract arrow of time the underlying mathematical algorithms also describing the fundamental forces can bring about a consistent reality and have abstract building blocks this is why the harmonic motion equations are used in many fields of physics involving periodic phenomena such as quantum mechanics and electro dynamics or why Einstein equivalence principle used to derive the model of space-time states that there is no difference between gravity and acceleration because gravity is only a force when interpreted relative to an oscillating frame of reference this can be illustrated with a logarithmic spiral curve being reduced to a helix curve by the reference frame making objects pin and moving orbits visually simplified to amplified or growing apples will be interpreted to attract each other when observed by an amplified reference frame as the size seems unaffected the opposite occurs with interferes in a simplified analogy the increase or decrease in the size of objects as we get closer or further away is determined by the shifting vectors of the reference frame similar to our radio homes in on different ways to pick up radio stations this also applies to the influence of gravity in essence independently of any reference frame there are no fundamental forces all interactions within our abstract continuity can be mathematically derived through interference and residents as Page 19/25 long as the ever-changing and fluctuating minimum unit or quantum being the frame of reference is taking into account experimental evidence includes the unseen effects in the standard model where we can see the force effect but not the actual force carriers yeah yeah the consistent continuity of reality it does not require quanta to have any specific sequence in time a quantum is not subject to any notion of space or time and can occupy all of its possible quantum states simultaneously this is called quantum superposition and has been demonstrated in experiments such as the double slit experiment or quantum teleportation where every electron in the universe for example could be the exact same one the only requirement for an abstract arrow of time and consistent continuity or reality is the algorithm describing the pattern or abstract sequence of vectors since this continuity brings about our ability to be self-aware it inherently makes the subject to its mathematical consequences the fundamental laws of physics interaction is merely an interpretation of what is essentially an abstract pattern this is why quantum mechanics can we provide mathematical descriptions since it can only describe patterns within infant probabilities when a probability is expressed as see the information necessary to describe the current moment or probability amplitude of c is also what embodies the Page 20/25 arrow of time the nature of the arrow of time is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics and has been responsible for many new popular interpretations the holographic principle for example a property of quantum gravity and three theories theorizes how the entire universe going to be seen as an information structure of we need two dimensions hmm yeah we traditionally associate the notion of an arrow of time with the sequence of events that we experience to the arrangement of short-term and long-term memories we can only have memories about the past and not about the future and we've always assumed that this reflects the flow of time scientists only began to question this logic when discoveries in quantum mechanics demonstrated that some phenomena are not bound by our notion of time and that our concept of it is nothing more than our perception of the changing observable values this is also reflected in time dilation and length contraction which are part of the reason why I'm Stein established that time and space are the same fabric in an absolute sense the notion of time does not differ from the notion of distance seconds are equal two light-seconds but cancel each other out to clarify with distance and time being each other's opposites the passing of time can be interpreted as the distance that the hands of a clock travel as the wind direction that is opposite to time as they move forward in distance they effectively travel backwards in what we would call time Page 21/25 this is also why any single separate minimum unit of experience is always instantly annihilated to within a timeless now this understanding sets the record straight between wave function collapse and quantum decoherence concepts such as life and death are mere intellectual constructs and any speculative spiritual ideas of an afterlife that takes place in a realm where the rigid mathematical underpinnings of this reality come to an end are equally fabricated an important cosmological consequence is that the Big Bang Theory where the universe is traced back to one . by looking at the past is a misconception the traditional assumption of space-time where space is three-dimensional and time plays the role of a fourth dimension is inaccurate if we would want to study the origin of the universe we would actually have to look forward since these time vector Direction is opposite to the arrow of distance from which we perceive an expanding universe although this temporal mapping of the universe will only yield abstract concepts with no relation to its quantum underpinnings experimental evidence includes the accelerating expanding universe following what is known to be an inverse or time reversed black hole metric as well as the many problems related to the big bang theory such as the horizon problem yeah these derivations could bring up questions about free will students awareness seems to only take place after the action within our perception of time most neurological investigations that Page 22/25 have shed light on this question show that action is to be taken before becoming conscious of it but a deterministic point of view is based on an erroneous concept of time as is illustrated by the mathematical probability descriptions in quantum mechanics these understandings will be relevant for future neurological research since they show how any neural circuits is a vector with direction underpinning cognitive dissonance and interference or resonance within see the ability to understand then consciously alter these directions acquired through billions of years of evolution confirms how important our belief systems are in expanding more awareness and how they affect our working memory which is responsible for the extent to which we can make connections and for the neural processes that create meaning it also explains how artificial awareness will require a network of independent processors instead of a linear sequence of complex algorithms that feels grand unification is one solution that unifies quantum physics and Einstein's theory of relativity while it answers many problems in physics such as the ones listed here it is my limited interpretation of his first months of scientific research whatever the outcome it is clear that we have entered an era where science is open to everyone and if we can preserve and filtered access to a neutral internet we can test the validity of our ideas we can enhance our imagination by making new coalition's and we can be part of the evolution of our understandings of the universe and of the mind Page 23/25 yeah yeah in quantum mechanics we have learned to approach reality differently and see everything as probabilities instead of certainties in a mathematical sense anything is possible as well as in science as in our daily lives the extent to which we can calculate or figure out probabilities is determined by our intellectual capability to recognize patterns the less biased we are the clear we can identify these patterns and base our actions on reasonable probabilities since it's in the very nature of our brains left hemisphere to deny ideas that do not fit into our current paradigm the more attached we are to a belief system the less able we are to make conscious choices for ourselves but by observing this process we expand our awareness and enhance our free will it is said that wisdom comes with H but with openness n skepticism the key principles of the scientific method we don't need decades of trial and error to sort out which of our convictions may be improbable the question is not whether our beliefs are right or wrong but the weather or not being emotionally attached to them is more or less likely going to benefit us there is no such thing as a free choice while being emotionally attached to a belief system the moment we are self-aware enough to realize this we can truly work together to figure out do real odds of what will benefit us the most yeah yeah Page 24/25 yeah yeah Page 25/25"

New Fenix 8- immediate issues…,Garmin,1i9m6u0,2025-01-25 07:45:17,1,0.67,1,https://i.redd.it/4neon10qy4fe1.jpeg,Blob97,New Watch Day / Device Review,"Recieved a Fenix 8 after trading in my 6 a few days ago and had a long run today to test it out, and although I love the screen and features there are some pretty big problems I’m finding it hard to look beyond for a £950 device. These are all based off 2 days of use and one run.

Firstly, this is my no means a major issue but just a little annoying, before the run I’d attempted to add climb pro, elevation and a couple of other data screens. These fields then disappeared from the data selection screen but also didn’t appear on the activity data screen as if they just… went missing, and there’s no way to add/remove it. They then re appeared during the activity, which is a little weird. There’s also no way to end navigation during the activity, or at least this wasn’t immediately obvious to me (I’m sure there is to be fair) but I didn’t want to stand there scrolling for half an hour during a run.

My main issue though is how inaccurate my heart rate readings are. This was my first time using the device, so I don’t know if it’s just an unhappy coincidence or whatever but todays run was about 14 miles at a fairly steady pace then 6 picking up towards threshold at the end. I’ve attached the graph from today and I’m not having that my heart rate stayed the same/even went down during this end section, meaning any potentially training effect has been skewed by these stats. As well as this at the beginning of the run the HR was showing as about 20BPM lower than I’d estimate before jumping up and eventually locking on to what I thought was accurate, and then pretty much staying the same for the rest of the run despite the change in paces. I don’t feel that after purchasing a £950 device, it should be down to me to purchase an additional monitor for better accuracy. I’m aware they can never be 100% accurate but this is significantly below the quality that I was expecting, to be frank. 

Once I’d saved the run my HR was then shown at around 178 before coming down immediately which is also a little odd. 

I just thought I’d write this as a bit of a review/rant of my first experience using the watch (I should add which is fully up to date) and wondering if anyone had any fixes/heard anything from garmin about this being rectified.
Many thanks!"
How to get a job and what I wish I did differently.,csMajors,1i9lz4d,2025-01-25 07:32:00,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1i9lz4d/how_to_get_a_job_and_what_i_wish_i_did_differently/,Counter-Business,,"The job market has been harder ever since around June of 2022 when the layoffs started. There’s a lot of people that simply lost hope and quit due to the increased difficulty to find a job. 

Although there are less jobs, some companies are still hiring. But the bar has been raised, so in order to get hired you simply have to work harder than everyone else. 

I started my job search around June of 22 and it took me until October of 22 to find a job which is 5 months of full time job searching. I think I could have greatly shortened this timeline if I had prepared appropriately while I was in college. 

Looking back on the experience, I realize I underestimated how much preparation I needed to do in order to get a job when I was in college. 

What I found out:
1. If you can’t do a leetcode medium then you have absolutely no shot. 

When I was in college, I prepared for trying to find a job by making side projects and trying to build my resume. Side projects are good and all, but if you get to the coding round, (which almost every company has) and you can not pass all the coding questions, you have a very small chance of getting to the job. 

Companies value leetcode a ton. Why? It should be obvious, but programming is all about patterns and solving problems. Although you may not use the algorithms every day, they are a good tool in your toolbelt if you need them, and the core problem solving skills translate to working very well. It’s also a great way to learn the language, especially if you look at other people’s solutions after you complete the problem. 

So what do I wish I had done differently? 

If I could have gone back, I would have started the leet code grind early. I would have studied up on it freshman and sophomore year so that I could stand out to internship recruiters and get a coding internship (I had no coding internship out of college because I couldn’t pass technicals when I was in college)

What should your goal be? (When do I know I am good enough?)

When you are able to solve 50% to 80% of leet code medium. 

The mediums are what most companies give for their coding rounds. Normally they give 2 questions so you don’t just get lucky on one you know. 

Probability of passing 2 problems coding assessment given the % of leet code mediums you can solve:

20% * 20% = 4%

50% * 50% = 25 %

70% * 70% = 50%

80% * 80% = 64%

90% * 90% = 81 %

So if you can get to the point you can solve 70 or 80% of leetcode mediums, then you will pass most technical rounds. You don’t have to pass every technical you take. But you do need to pass a certain threshold to make the application process more worth your time.  If you are worse than 20% of leetcode mediums that you can complete, you are better off studying than applying for jobs at that point. 

After the technical rounds, (if you are the best technical candidate) then the rest of the process should be a lot easier. "

Farmers 'have to fight back' against inheritance tax changes,northernireland,1i9kkj9,2025-01-25 05:56:04,0,0.39,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1i9kkj9/farmers_have_to_fight_back_against_inheritance/,HeWasDeadAllAlong,News,"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2egzkdnxj8o

Farmer Andrew Little is still reeling after the ""kick in the teeth"" that he feels the budget delivered.

The announcement of a cap on Agricultural Property Relief (APR) for inheritance tax took the sector by surprise.

Hundreds of farmers will take part in tractor rallies across the UK on Saturday in protest at the change.

Mr Little is a second-generation dairy farmer from County Fermanagh, and the thought of eventually receiving a large bill is preying on his mind.

""We're at the mercies of Mother Nature,"" he said.

""We have a bad year of weather, it crucifies us, but we always get through,"" Mr Little added.

""But this here, we can't get through it because if you have a tax of maybe two or three hundred thousand pound, that's two grand a month for 10 years and that could hit two generations in the one farm in a very short space of time.""

He will lead one of the seven rallies across Northern Ireland.

NI Secretary speaks after farming concern over budget

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) has estimated, external that almost half of all farms in Northern Ireland may be over the £1 million threshold, making them liable to pay inheritance tax at 20%.

Dairy farms like Andrew Little's are particularly badly hit, as they tend to be larger with more high-value sheds and equipment.

The government insists the majority of farms in Northern Ireland will be unaffected.

It is adamant that its policy will not change. Other reliefs may help reduce the amount owed, but concern remains high.

Some farmers describe themselves as ""asset-rich but cash-poor"", and according to Mr Little, that sets them apart.

""We have assets worth hundreds of thousands of pounds and millions of pounds. In a good year we may yield 0.5% or 1% profit, whereas most other businesses out there are running at 10%, 15% or maybe even more of a profit of their asset worth,"" he said.

""Could you go and ask the farmer to write a cheque for 10% of what he's worth? He probably can't.""
'They're attacking our livelihood'

In November, thousands of farmers gathered at the Eikon Exhibition Centre in Lisburn

The tractor rallies are the latest in a series of protests.

Thousands of farmers in Northern Ireland signed a petition and attended a meeting in the Eikon Centre in November, ahead of a protest lobby and demonstration in London.

Mr Little said his business has supported 62 others in the area in the last financial year, with purchases and payments ranging from £10 to thousands.

He fears that the change to inheritance tax will drive people like him away from agriculture and affect other businesses as a result.

""They're attacking our livelihood, so we have to fight back. We don't want to go out and do all these things you see on the internet, of blockades and all that craic and put the government against us,"" he said.

He added that farmers ""want to feed the public; that's all we want to do"".

""You have to be hopeful that [the government] realises the impact that [tax changes] will have on the rural economy. And you have to live in hope.""

The rallies are set to embark at 14:00 GMT, and maps of the routes are available online."

Hi all,

For over three years now, I’ve had this bee in my bonnet and no one who would understand the reasons I’m so pissed off. But since discovering this pod over the past couple months, I finally feel comfortable sharing this with a group of people who, I hope, understand.

On Saturday, 14 August, 2021, I followed my team, Cardiff City, away in Blackpool (what a time of year that is to go up there, by the way). We won comfortably, goals coming from Leandro Bacuna and Kieffer Moore. Brilliant stuff all round.

You can only imagine the jubilant scenes, then, when nineteen year-old left-back Joel Bagan puts in what can only be described as a crunching challenge, really letting the Blackpool winger know he’s there, leaving a bit on him too. It’s exactly the sort of thing you want to see from a youngster finding his feet in men’s football. To show their appreciation, the Bluebirds faithful gave a rendition of “he’s one of our own”.

Joel Bagan is from Basingstoke. He joined Cardiff City from Southampton as a seventeen year-old, and has been capped at youth level by both Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. I would wager that Joel Bagan very much is not one of Cardiff’s own.

What’s the threshold for this? Surely the Stretford End wasn’t serenading Federicho Macheda or Adnan Januzaj in this manner? Raheem Sterling was excellent breaking through at Liverpool, but surely he wasn’t classed as one of their own? Should a player not be from where the fans are from? Even if it’s just vaguely nearby? Mark Harris is from Swansea, but Cardiff fans still called him one of our own, and I didn’t quite mind that.

Am I overthinking this?"

Whether you're designing for a small apartment, a studio, or a cozy home, mobility fixtures can significantly enhance both functionality and comfort without compromising on style. This article delves into the best [mobility fixtures](https://www.truegether.com/category/health-and-beauty) for compact living spaces, highlighting their features, benefits, and why they are essential for modern living.

https://preview.redd.it/w6x8474zo3fe1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=b45086dc67e3474f05f28bde64d0421b6260b164

**The Growing Need for Mobility Fixtures in Small Spaces**

The rise of urbanization has led to smaller living areas becoming the norm in many cities. According to a report by the United Nations, **over 56% of the global population now resides in urban areas**, where space is often at a premium. Compact living spaces demand innovative solutions that optimize functionality without sacrificing aesthetics, and mobility fixtures are stepping up to meet this demand.

Moreover, with an aging global population—**1 in 6 people will be over the age of 60 by 2030, according to WHO**—there is a growing need for accessible furniture that caters to limited mobility, even in small homes. This convergence of urban living and accessibility needs has fueled innovations in mobility furniture and fixtures designed specifically for compact spaces.

**Top Mobility Fixtures for Compact Living Spaces**

**1. Foldable Mobility Chairs**

Foldable mobility chairs are a lifesaver for those who need additional support but don’t have space for bulky equipment. These chairs are lightweight, easy to store, and incredibly versatile. Modern designs allow for seamless integration into home decor, offering a dual benefit of style and practicality.

* **Fact**: The global mobility aids market, including foldable chairs, was valued at **$7.2 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% from 2022 to 2030.
* **Pro Tip**: Look for chairs with adjustable heights and ergonomic seating for maximum comfort in smaller spaces.

**2. Compact Lift Chairs**

Lift chairs are essential for individuals with limited mobility, as they make sitting and standing easier. In compact spaces, opting for slim-profile lift chairs with built-in storage or USB ports can save space while adding functionality.

These chairs often feature sleek, space-saving designs that blend seamlessly with modern interiors. Many models now come with recliner options, offering additional comfort without requiring extra floor space.

* **Stat**: Nearly **30% of adults over the age of 65** experience mobility issues, making lift chairs an essential fixture in their homes.

**3. Height-Adjustable Desks**

Working from home has become a norm for many, and adjustable desks provide the flexibility required for compact spaces. These desks can be raised or lowered depending on the user's needs, and they pair perfectly with ergonomic chairs.

Many models come with wheels for easy mobility, allowing you to move the desk between rooms if needed. Some even double as dining tables, maximizing functionality in smaller homes.

* **Fact**: According to a study by the National Library of Medicine, **height-adjustable desks improve posture and reduce back pain by 60%**, making them an excellent investment for health and mobility.

**4. Wall-Mounted Grab Bars and Handrails**

Safety is paramount in compact living spaces, especially in bathrooms and kitchens. Wall-mounted grab bars and handrails offer stability and are ideal for individuals with limited mobility. Modern grab bars come in stylish designs and finishes, ensuring they don’t detract from the aesthetics of the home.

These fixtures are particularly useful in multi-functional spaces, such as small bathrooms that double as laundry areas.

* **Pro Tip**: Opt for foldable grab bars that can be tucked away when not in use to save space.

**5. Compact Walk-In Bathtubs and Showers**

Bathrooms are often the smallest spaces in a home, yet they pose significant safety risks. Compact walk-in tubs and showers are designed to fit into tight spaces while providing accessibility features like low thresholds, built-in seats, and anti-slip flooring.

* **Stat**: According to the CDC, **80% of falls among older adults occur in the bathroom**, making mobility fixtures like walk-in tubs crucial for safety.
* **Bonus Feature**: Many compact tubs now come with hydrotherapy options, offering therapeutic benefits in addition to accessibility.

**6. Portable Ramps and Threshold Solutions**

Portable ramps are perfect for navigating small steps or uneven thresholds in compact homes. These ramps are lightweight, foldable, and easy to store when not in use. They are particularly beneficial for wheelchair users or individuals using mobility aids.

* **Fact**: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) recommends ramps with a slope ratio of **1:12**, which can be easily achieved with modern portable designs.

**7. Sliding and Pocket Doors**

Traditional swing doors take up valuable floor space and can be challenging to maneuver around in compact homes. Sliding or pocket doors are excellent alternatives, as they require minimal space and offer smooth operation.

For mobility purposes, consider adding handles or automated opening systems that can be operated with a remote or smartphone.

* **Stat**: Sliding doors can save up to **8-10 square feet of floor space per door**, making them ideal for small living areas.

**Benefits of Mobility Fixtures for Compact Spaces**

1.    **Maximized Usable Space**: Compact mobility fixtures are specifically designed to optimize the use of every square foot in a home.

2.    **Enhanced Safety**: Features like grab bars, walk-in tubs, and adjustable desks reduce the risk of falls and injuries.

3.    **Improved Accessibility**: Mobility fixtures promote independence for individuals with limited mobility, enabling them to perform daily tasks more comfortably.

4.    **Stylish Designs**: Gone are the days of clunky, industrial-looking fixtures. Modern designs blend functionality with aesthetics.

5.    **Longevity**: Many mobility fixtures are built to last, offering long-term value for homeowners.

**Tips for Choosing the Right Fixtures**

1.    **Assess Your Needs**: Identify the specific mobility challenges you want to address.

2.    **Measure Your Space**: Ensure the fixture fits comfortably in your home without overcrowding.

3.    **Opt for Multi-Functionality**: Look for fixtures that serve more than one purpose, such as lift chairs with storage.

4.    **Prioritize Safety Features**: Non-slip surfaces, sturdy handles, and secure mounting options are essential.

5.    **Invest in Quality**: While budget-friendly options are tempting, prioritize durability and functionality.

Zone 2 experience - not the holy grail,tacticalbarbell,1i9icmt,2025-01-25 03:09:11,6,0.64,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacticalbarbell/comments/1i9icmt/zone_2_experience_not_the_holy_grail/,Educational-Party597,Endurance,"Since heart rate running and zone 2 posts have be ome pretty regular here I thought I’d share my experience with Z2 running and Tactical Barbell. Spoiler alert: it might not be what you need. For context, last year I only did Green Protocol’s continuation protocols. 

In 2023 I ran PBs in 5k (21:23), 10k (45:10) and HM (1:44:53). In 2024 I believed the hype and ran easy runs in zone 2, even if it felt unnatural, I believed it would improve with time and would lead me to faster runs.

All my measurable metrics got worse. 5k best was 23:57. 10k fell to 47:56 and HM fell to 1:53:52. Easy run pace and HR at that pace got worse. Even my resting HR got worse. Difference being that in 2023 I trained on RPE and pace not HR. I run three times a week and other stuff as well, weights, cycle, swim.

2025 will be a return to RPE running in hopes to get back to previous bests. I guess proper zone 2 training requires at least 5 runs (with a lot of mileage) a week with a very strong pace, otherwise it’s just undertraining in my experience.

My HR ranges were set based on %LTHR which were done by doing Garmin’s lactate threshold test with a chest strap. 

Edit: I didn’t only do Z2. I said I did GP continuation protocols which have speed/tempo/threshold work too. Going to specify that my easy runs were based on HR Z2. "

I was started on .15mL/weekly and then increased to .25mL weekly in the last month and I am not really enjoying the higher dose mentally. I am going to lower it back to .15mL and maybe even to .1mL if .15mL is too much still. I know it is definitely a dosage increase issue but I want to know if any other nonbinary ppl have experienced this too? theres just not that many firsthand experiences i hear about this stuff and im always curious to know others experiences or if anyone has any advice on how to handle it!

Lil Sha appreciation post (S2E6 thoughts),arcane,1i9hp4u,2025-01-25 02:20:56,9,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/comments/1i9hp4u/lil_sha_appreciation_post_s2e6_thoughts/,acesulfame_K19,Discussion,"**SPOILERS TO PRETTY MUCH ALL OF SEASON 2 OF ARCANE**

The end of season 2, episode 6 was one of my favorite moments in Arcane because I have issues, clearly. There is fair criticism around Isha’s character development and her being a plot device for jinx, but I wanted to talk about why I found that scene to be so incredibly impactful. This isn’t really an analysis, it’s mostly just stream of consciousness slightly organized so I don’t sound insane.

[Scene here to re-traumatize you all, but missing Viktor’s monologue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS-xaR5fENE)

# Context and recap:

* As Isha’s song begins, we Viktor’s monologue part 1 of 2. I wish there had been more time in Season 2 for Viktor to reach this conclusion, but even so, the monologue sandwiching this scene is so fitting.
* From the very start, this scene is laden with emotion. It’s an “action” scene, but it’s really not. We’re shocked by Viktor getting blasted by Jayce when he isn’t even a child, and the scene opens with Ambessa, full of grief at witnessing Richter’s death, ordering the charge, pain written all over her face.

# The scene:

We get some quick cuts to each member of Isha’s new family. Vi, Cait, Vander, Jinx being struck down. In this moment, we focus on Isha.

There is so much communicated through her facial expressions here. First, it’s a look of desperation, and seeing no one available to save her loved ones, she formulates a plan, and her face shifts to a look of resolve.

This reminds me of [one my favorite scenes from The Fellowship of the Ring (beginning of the video until about 1:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjAAC13al9s). The scene near the end of the movie when the fellowship has been scattered. Frodo stands alone on the banks of the Anduin, balking at the enormous task before him, believing the duty has fallen solely on him. He remembers Gandalf’s words, and despite the task being no less impossible from one moment to the next, his face shifts from an expression of fear to one of resolve. To me at least, it’s this incredibly powerful and emotional moment.

I bring this scene up not because it is identical to the arcane scene. I bring this up to draw attention to two scenes that are mostly facial expressions and music, nothing grandiose or flashy by any means. Yet that moment of finding resolve despite the anxiety, fear, and uncertainty moved me in both scenes. Both scenes are also elevated so much by the music. The Shire reprise by Howard Shore in LotR, and Isha’s Song sung by Eason Chan in Arcane.

**A comment on the art and music:**

* I absolutely loved the art style switch to the pencil/crayon like animation. It’s so creative, and each flashback scene was so heartwarming.
* I loved the entire flashback / running sequence. But specifically as the song begins to crescendo as Isha runs, and then she leaps off the fallen shield and the scene cuts to Isha and Jinx soaring through the air in the alternate art style — FUCK, those were maybe my favorite few seconds in all of Arcane.

# Characters:

**Isha:**

I really enjoyed [this video about Isha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJK4lovffog) and I definitely recommend a watch! I’ll mention a few things here, but the video is really phenomenal.

* When we meet Isha, she is both a child and vulnerable, making her that much more impressionable, especially by her savior. Jinx exhibits a calm and coolness with violence, with who she is at this moment. She embraces the danger and even tells Isha that one feels most alive in the danger.
* This gets reinforced in the Sevika Smeech fight, with Jinx taking out the goons easily and treating it like a game almost. Essentially, the threshold for violence gets lowered repeatedly for Isha. It becomes normal.
* She intervenes in the Vi and Jinx fight. She incites violence at the checkpoints. She jumps on Richter’s face. She watches Jinx basically sacrifice herself to fight Warwick so Sevika and Isha can get out. She becomes a girl of passion and action, desensitized to violence and life threatening situations.

Now, I don’t want to glorify a child giving up their life, and I think that’s what makes this all the more heartbreaking. This new life, joy, and hope, that she found consists completely of the people on this battlefield. All the good she's had in her short life is crumbling before her very eyes. She has fought for these loved ones before and succeeded. She knows she can do something about it. She must do something about it. With the magnitude of what’s at stake, and with her familiarity with violence and quick action, she decides in just a few heartbeats to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect everything she loves.

**Jinx:**

To me, this is why this whole sequence is so impactful:

To herself, Jinx has no redeemable qualities. She killed Claggor, and Milo, she committed atrocities as Silco’s tool, she killed Silco. She is lost, broken, and evil.

*There is no good version of her*.

But to Isha, Jinx is a protector, a nurturer, a big sister, a hero. She is *everything* good Isha has ever experienced. There *is* a good version of Jinx, and she’s not just in the AU. She is right here in this universe.

Isha’s character is far more than just the effect her death had on Jinx. Even though Jinx spirals after this, the story of Jinx eventually finding the strength to start something new began from the moment she met Isha.

# A contemplation about humanity:

At last, we close with Viktor, summing up everything so well. Outside the specific context of the Arcane, I find the theme of his monologue to be true. People are complex. Our compassion, our hate, perhaps the line is thinner than we like to think. But maybe that capacity for good and evil is what makes the strive to guide all our flawed, human passion towards nurturing and healing rather than destruction that much more beautiful and noble of a pursuit.

\-----

If you made it this far, thank you and I love you. Would love to hear your thoughts on Isha, if you loved or hated her character. "
Great news from ACON - Reverse Split + New CUSIP number - Could we see a forced buy back?,pennystocks,1i9goux,2025-01-25 01:09:36,16,0.73,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1i9goux/great_news_from_acon_reverse_split_new_cusip/,-eShTuPiD,:DDNerd: 🄳🄳 :DDNerd:,"Alright, so here’s the deal with $ACON (Aclarion, Inc.): they just announced a reverse split and new CUSIP number. This is setting the stage for some interesting things to happen, especially since this stock has been heavily shorted, and I’m talking about illegal naked shorts.

What’s Going On:  
1. Reverse Split: Aclarion is restructuring its shares. If you hold shares, you’ll have fewer after the split, but they’ll be worth more per share. The total value of your holdings stays the same.
2. New CUSIP Number: A new identifier for the stock will be issued post-split. This is a big deal because it forces brokers and clearinghouses to reconcile all shares, which will expose any phantom shares from naked shorting.  

--- 

Why This Matters:  
ACON has been heavily shorted, and the data hints at some shady activity:  
- Short Interest: Over 31% of the float is shorted. 
- Off-Exchange Short volume: 189,222,969 with a short ratio of 58%!
- FTDs (Failures-to-Deliver): There have been consistent settlement issues, which is usually a red flag for naked shorting.  
- Reg SHO Threshold List: ACON is on the list, which means it’s had significant unresolved settlement problems. 

Now, with a reverse split and new CUSIP, things get spicy. If there are naked shorts, these positions have to be covered or closed because everything has to match under the new CUSIP. No shortcuts.  

---

What Could Happen:  
1. Forced Buybacks: If brokers or clearinghouses can’t account for all the shares, they’ll force naked shorts to cover. This could trigger a short squeeze, sending the price flying.  
2. Volatility Incoming: Reverse splits often attract attention from traders, institutions and hedge funds, so expect some big swings.  
3. A Potential Catalyst: If regulatory bodies or brokers crack down on these positions during the CUSIP change, it could put insane upward pressure on the stock price.  

---

Bottom Line:  
This might be the setup for something big. ACON’s reverse split and new CUSIP could force naked short sellers into buybacks, and we all know what happens when that goes down. Is this the next short squeeze in the making? Could be. 


---

A quick refresher of what has happened over the past few weeks:

1. ACON announced their closing for the $14.4 Million Public Offering of Common Stock and Warrants allowing it to redeem all Series B Preferred Stock, which improves its financial structure

2. The company is planning to redeeming/buying back all of its Series B Preferred Stock, which basically means they're going to pay back the investors who own those shares at a premium.

3.The company is on the Regulations SHO list. These are lists of companies that have been illegally shorted and multiple FTDs and will need to cover. SEC does a great job in investigating on these companies and imposes fines or penalties on those involved. Also force buy backs. Hence the reason why ACON is conducting the reverse split earlier than anticipated.

4. The companies directors and officers agreed on a 90 day lock-up period after the closing of their $14.4M dollar deal. The company will not be selling, offer, lend, grant or otherwise dispose any common stock or security.

5. The company also released an SC 13G stating that SEG Opportunity Fund, LLC holds a significant but passive investment in Aclarion Inc with 4.4mm ACON common stock. This represents 9.9% of the total outstanding shares of the company.

6. After the Nasdaq compliance hearing, the panel has extended their demonstration of Nasdaq compliance until April. After the reverse split on Wednesday January 29, 2025. They should be in compliance by February 5th, 2025 (5 consecutive trading days above $1)

7. The company currently has $13M cash in hand and is trading at a market cap of $2M

For a stock that has been getting a lot of back lash and hate, this is a stock that is making the right move and moving into the right direction.

Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice, just sharing what I’ve found. Always do your own research before trading.


Psa: my average is 0.055 as I averaged up today. Since a lot of people told me I'm trying to pump this because I'm bag holding shares at 0.30 lol

I've laid it out for y'all, strong buy and hold! The naked shorts will need to cover by Tuesday, don't sell your shares to them for pennies. This reverse split news is great news for the company. And mind I remind you the company isn't selling (read #4 again)"
Disgusted by customer service and ADA regulations.,marriott,1i9gk6r,2025-01-25 01:01:20,18,0.69,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1i9gk6r/disgusted_by_customer_service_and_ada_regulations/,MrMisadventerous,Review,"



I am a wheelchair user and stayed at the Westin by Marriott in San Jose for four nights in an ‘accessible’ room and it was a disaster. To begin with I arrived a couple hours earlier than my check in, understandably my room was not ready so I decided to check my bags and go find a spot for my car, the hotel valet is ~$50 per day, I found public parking for $10 per day. When I came back the only bathroom they had for guests without a room was down two flights of stairs or one floor on the elevator(s), of which there are two for guests, which are both periodically broken leaving people stranded or stuck inside. Once at my room we discovered that the door was EXTREMELY heavy meaning I could not open it or hold it open alone I needed a companion to do that. The interior was average with less furniture clogging up the roll space but barely enough for me in a manual chair to wheel around the bed in one direction let alone turn on a dime and go the other way. The bathroom doorway was narrow allowing me just enough room to pull myself through the threshold but if i tried to push myself my hands and fingers would be slammed in the doorway. The bathroom itself was somewhat spacious with enough room for me to turn my chair and roll under the sink and up to the shower. However the shower itself while seemingly accessible, almost never had warm/hot water, and had the fold down chair against the roll in ‘doorway’ which only had a sheet meaning I was constantly spraying out of the shower while cleaning myself. 

On top of the room being barely suitable the elevators were both down at numerous times leaving me stranded at my room or much worse on the ground floor with no access to a bathroom. When this occurred staff were completely unhelpful. They informed me that the elevators were down and when i tried questioning as to how i could get to my room, a bathroom, or where the service elevator might be they claimed they wouldn’t help, there was no service elevator, and then walked away leaving me to sit in agony for nearly 30 minutes till one of the elevators suddenly started up again. 

Later that evening after going out for food late at night I returned around 11:30-12 to find they had locked the only door of 3 front entrances that has an ADA button. With a sign that says they will continue to lock it at 11 to have guests use their key card to enter the Main Entrance (center door of 3) which does not have an ADA button nor did anyone working inside who saw me waiting for a companion to open the door for 5-10 minutes come to help. Thankfully after two nights there were security who recognized and would help with the door after those nights. 
 
During my stay there I attempted to be of little issue because they made it clear they wouldnt help if I was, so after concluding my time there I came home and collected my thoughts. My companion contacted the hotel to make them aware of these issues, not only were they dismissive, saying because we didnt make formal complaints at the time of the booking so those were not actual problems nor dis anyone else complain, they also wouldnt do anything and the ADA issues werent issues because the hotel and accessible rooms are up to Marriott standards. Which makes me believe that any and all marriott hotels would consider this accessibility acceptable, which it is not. 
Overall there was at least a bit of effort to get things accessible but they clearly don’t service those things regularly nor do they care if it actually works for the disabled person just that they can claim they have it. 100% will never spend a night here again and I’m infuriated i had to spend so much money to be in dangerous and unsafe lodging. 

TLDR; wheelchair users should beware when staying at the westin by marriott in San Jose I spent four nights during a con where there were numerous ADA issues and was repeatedly dismissed. I made a formal complaint after and then was told that because i didnt complain at the time they wouldnt do anything and all the ADA issues i brought to their attention were non issues because those things were to marriott standards.

It doesn’t have to be anything major, but if you have a bunch of high value uniques in your stash listed for 1ex, and you consistently ignore requests to buy those items, those listings should get them removed (and probably be blocked from being re-listed for some period of time).

If they’re not replying, remove their listing!

(Or just give us an auction house)

Edit: I’m talking about the people with like 1ex listings that are getting constantly spammed, not people who are busy and ignore a couple of messages because they’re in trials or something. Could just have like a threshold amount ignored trades before this would kick in."

Instead of, idk walking around to speak to my face she instead goes and complains to the mate like I blatantly straight up knew she was talking to me and didn’t acknowledge her. Do these people lose all critical thinking skills and common decency when they enter the threshold of our stores? Like I just cannot comprehend the thought process.

The Skylight Zone: Part IX: The Mirror That Swallowed the Stars.,u_TheSkyLightZone,1i9drgo,2025-01-24 22:15:30,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/9jd478g252fe1.jpeg,TheSkyLightZone,,"The Skylight Zone: Part IX: The Mirror That Swallowed the Stars:



In the Skylight Zone, reflection isn’t always recognition, and sometimes a mirror is more than glass—it’s a doorway. Tonight, Jonathan Gale finds himself standing at the threshold of possibility, staring into the infinite void of his own making. The stars above are waiting, and the question remains: What happens when the mirror stares back?



Jonathan Gale stood on the glowing platform once more, clutching the radiant thread that pulsed softly in his hand. Beside him, Nyx adjusted her hourglass, now empty but glowing faintly. Around them, the Terminal buzzed with silence, the corridors shifting like a living thing.



“What now?” Jonathan asked.



Nyx tilted her head toward the void beyond the platform, where constellations shimmered like fading memories. “We keep going,” she said, her voice calm but uncertain.



Jonathan’s gaze fell to a colossal mirror that had appeared before them. It was larger than anything he’d ever seen, spanning the width of the Terminal and reaching into the void above. Its surface rippled like water, reflecting not their faces but fragments of their journeys—him as the weary traveler in the café, Nyx holding the hourglass in the observatory, the nutcrackers spinning endlessly on the carousel.



“This wasn’t here before,” Jonathan said, stepping closer to the mirror.



“Things don’t stay the same here,” Nyx replied. “You know that by now.”



The mirror shimmered, and Jonathan’s reflection emerged—separate, alive, and smirking. “Ah, Jonathan,” it said, its voice dripping with amusement. “Still searching for answers you’re not ready to hear?”



Jonathan stepped back. “Who… what are you?”



“I’m you,” the reflection said, tilting its head. “Or rather, the version of you that never left the café, that broke the hourglass, that surrendered to the carousel. Every Jonathan that could have been. And now I’ve come to remind you of what you left behind.”



Nyx stepped forward, her expression sharp. “You’re not real.”



The reflection chuckled. “Neither are you, Nyx. Not in the way you think. You’re as much a thread as he is, woven into a tapestry you can’t see. But don’t worry—you’ll unravel soon enough.”



Jonathan felt the thread in his hand begin to pull, as though something in the mirror was trying to take it. “What do you want?”



“I want what you want,” the reflection replied. “To be free. To be whole. But the truth, Jonathan, is that you’ll never be free as long as you carry that thread. Give it to me, and you’ll finally be at peace.”



Jonathan hesitated. The thread glowed brighter, its warmth soothing yet heavy, like a memory he couldn’t let go of.



“Don’t listen to it,” Nyx said firmly. “This is another test, another mirror trying to pull you in. If you give up that thread, you’ll lose everything.”



“And if he keeps it?” the reflection sneered. “He’ll just keep wandering, unraveling bit by bit, until there’s nothing left.”



The Terminal began to tremble, the mirrors along its walls cracking and distorting. From each shattered surface emerged more reflections—dozens of Jonathans, each one wearing a different expression: anger, regret, joy, despair.



“You see?” the first reflection said. “We’re all here, waiting for you to choose. Because no matter what you do, Jonathan, you can’t escape us. We are you.”



Jonathan turned to Nyx, panic rising in his chest. “What do I do?”



“You hold on,” Nyx said. “The thread is your anchor. It’s the only thing keeping you from becoming one of them.”



The reflections surged forward, their hands outstretched, their voices a cacophony of demands. “Give it to us, Jonathan! Let us take the burden!”



Jonathan clutched the thread tighter, its glow intensifying until it burned his hand. He closed his eyes, focusing on its warmth, the feeling of something real amidst the chaos.



“Enough!” he shouted, the word echoing through the Terminal.



The thread flared, sending a shockwave through the space. The reflections froze, their forms shattering like glass, their voices silenced. The mirror before him rippled violently, then went still.



When Jonathan opened his eyes, the platform was quiet again. The mirror now reflected only him and Nyx, their faces weary but whole.



Nyx placed a hand on his shoulder. “You did it.”



Jonathan let out a shaky breath. “What was that?”



“The past,” Nyx said simply. “Every choice you didn’t make, every version of yourself you left behind. But you don’t belong to them anymore.”



Jonathan looked at the thread in his hand, its glow now steady and soft. “So what happens now?”



Nyx gestured toward the void beyond the mirror, where a new doorway had appeared. Through it, the stars burned brighter than ever, forming a path that seemed to stretch into infinity.



“Now,” she said, “we move forward.”



Jonathan nodded, stepping toward the doorway. The thread pulsed gently in his hand, and as he crossed the threshold, the stars whispered his name.



Sometimes mirrors aren’t just reflections—they’re windows into the choices that could have been. Tonight, Jonathan Gale stared into the glass and found not his past, but his future. And as he steps beyond the final star, one thing is certain: the journey is far from over.

"Potentially wrongful termination via retaliation, is there a case here? (Indiana)",legaladvice,1i9dhqv,2025-01-24 22:01:10,0,0.33,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i9dhqv/potentially_wrongful_termination_via_retaliation/,nitko87,Employment Law,"Hi legal scholars, this is my first post here so if anything is wrong, please let me know and I’ll try to fix it. This is a long post. 

My friend was terminated from their job today. They were a case manager for an in-house team that handled employee FMLA approvals and denials at their Company A (as I will call it). 

About 6 months ago, the company underwent a management shuffle and picked up a new executive who decided that the FMLA approval process for their employees should be outsourced, bringing in Company B and leaving the fate of the in-house team undecided (on the record). 

Off the record, my friend’s manager said that only one of the people on the team would be retained once the transition had completed, that person being my friend. They had not yet morphed the role, but it was in the works. 

My friend asked again a couple weeks later, and her manager (two notches below the new executive who decided to outsource) accidentally let slip that there is no plan to keep my friend’s position, implying an inevitable layoff, which implies a future severance payout. This manager was not supposed to spill that information yet.

In the meantime, FMLA approvals and paperwork would be done in-house until the end of 2024. 

Fast forward to end of year 2024. My friend learns that Company B does a few things differently than Company A did when FMLA was done in house, one of which was seemingly unlawful on the surface. My friend sought legal counsel through a contact at the Department of Labor (DOL) for advice with a practice Company B does. Company A used the federal FMLA factsheet’s recommendation to grant FMLA approval or denial based on worked hours at time of filing rather than time of leave. This is to prevent wasted time on recounts, which really only applies to part time employees who receive benefits while working 24hrs per week. To receive FMLA approval, you have to work 1250 hrs in the past 12 months. On a 24 hour week, you hit 1248 in a calendar year, which means you have to pick up a shift somewhere in there for access to FMLA approval, which is disclosed when those employees apply and don’t hit that threshold. Work an extra shift, reapply, get your FMLA, take your leave at the scheduled time, no big deal. 

Company B uses what the DOL contact called a loophole in the law’s writing, because Company B will recount hours at the time of scheduled leave, and decline a previously approved FMLA application if the hours at time of leave are not over 1250, even if they were at the time of application. Not even the government employees working for the State of Indiana are subject to this recounting practice. This becomes an issue specifically with pregnant employees or those who need a serious operation to deal with a chronic condition that affects ability to work close to time of leave. They might be just over that 1250 hour benchmark 2-3 months before leave, but have to take time off early due to pain, sickness, or other complications, which can put them below 1250 hours at time of leave. 

This exact situation popped up at the end of 2024, with an employee who works 24 hours a week needing FMLA for the birth of a baby she was expecting in April. My friend approved her because she qualified, but in the approval email she made very clear that Company B, which is taking over this case in 2025, will be recounting her hours at time of leave, and legally can deny her FMLA in April despite the approval she is getting here in December 2024. My friend noted that legal counsel with the DOL was consulted on the matter, and there isn’t much more that can be done since it is technically legal to recount at time of leave.

This email makes its way onto the desk of the executive who decided to outsource in the first place, and it did not make him happy. A surprise virtual meeting was scheduled, where my friend was ambushed and accosted by the executive himself, VP of HR, my friend’s boss, and a few other people in management and HR. The meeting was recorded and retained by my friend, and exported onto a personal device. The management team berated my friend and told them that the email informing the other employee of what Company B would do with FMLA was harmful to Company A, could open them to litigation, and all this other stuff. The management team did not approve of contacting the DOL, nor citing the response in the email to the employee seeing FMLA. The executive essentially said that one more toe out of line and he would fire my friend. A follow up meeting was scheduled, and a week or so later at this meeting, my friend was terminated, with the only explanation in writing being “[Friend] was told to immediately cease the offensive behavior…[yet] continued to undermine the relationship between Company B and Company A, and caused mistrust between management and employees…” etc.

For context, records will prove that my friend has a squeaky clean performance rating with zero prior write-ups at this company, where my friend has worked for nearly two decades. Evidence that exists after the termination on my friend’s side are some saved emails, a recording of the follow up virtual meeting (not the one where my friend was ambushed and berated, but the one where my friend was terminated I think), some anecdotal stuff about relations of these employees, the termination letter etc. There may be more, not sure. 

On the employer side, barring any deep evidence scrubbing, the email that got my friend fired to the employee seeking FMLA should still exist in her inbox, the evidence of the meeting where my friend got ambushed by management exists, and I’m sure metadata regarding counsel with DOL legal and Company A’s internal and external legal partners still exists. 

What ends up happening in the aftermath of what seems to have been a case of goodwill whistleblowing (if you can even call it that) is my friend has been cheated out of 17ish weeks of severance pay that they knew they would get if they rode out the job title into the sunset (per my friend’s manager’s slip up that my friend may not end up with a role after Company B has fully transitioned into its slot in the FMLA group). My friend obviously now has no income, no health insurance, and I would like to know on their behalf whether there is merit in hiring an attorney to sue Company A for illegal retaliatory termination. 

Please feel free to let me know if I can add anymore details that would help, and thanks for taking a look at this. "

this is actually the second part of the first chapter, here's the link to the first one if you want: [https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1h21mls/heres\_the\_second\_draft\_of\_my\_silly\_story\_907\_words/](https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1h21mls/heres_the_second_draft_of_my_silly_story_907_words/)

here goes:

After a long trek through the forest, Tarran finally arrived at his home. It wasn’t much—a modest wooden cabin nestled on the edge of the village, plain and unassuming. No carvings adorned its walls, no trinkets dangled from its eaves. It was functional, little more than shelter for his family of four. The rooms were tight, almost too tight at times, but it sufficed.

Tonight, though, as Tarran stood outside with the blood-streaked infant cradled in his arms, the house felt smaller than ever.

He hesitated on the threshold, his heart heavier than the child he carried. How could he explain this to his wife? How could he tell her he’d found a baby wailing in a pool of blood in the forest? No, perhaps it was better she didn’t know. If word got out, the village wouldn’t bother asking questions. The decision would be swift and unanimous: *burn it*.

The thought chilled him. The flames, the screams, the chanting—it was all too vivid.

And yet, a darker doubt gnawed at him. What if keeping the child was a mistake? What if the boy *was* a bad omen, a harbinger of ruin? Tarran wasn’t made for such decisions. He wasn’t a priest or a scholar. He was just a hunter. He killed to survive, to put food on the table. The stories he’d heard of magic users were always just that—stories. This child, though, felt different. The blood, the cries, the way he’d been left to die in the forest—surely, there had to be a reason.

Lost in his thoughts, Tarran barely noticed the faint creak of the front door opening. His wife stepped outside, her face a mosaic of emotions—surprise, worry, and just a touch of disappointment.

She glanced at the infant, her brow furrowing. “Tarran…” she began, her voice uncertain, teetering on the edge of concern and disbelief.

The hunter shifted awkwardly, his grip tightening on the baby. Words failed him as the weight of his decision loomed larger than ever.

Expecting meat, it was only natural for {wife's name} to feel both surprise and disappointment upon seeing her husband return with a child instead. The strain of another mouth to feed wasn’t a small matter, especially when food was scarce and precious. They still had some bread left, perhaps a bit of dried fruit or soup tucked away, but a fresh kill would have made the difference between sustenance and satisfaction.

Still, the sight of the bloodied infant stirred something deeper within her—an unease she couldn’t quite place. Her gaze lingered on the child, her thoughts warring between maternal instinct and the whispered superstitions of their village.

“Tarran,” she began again, her voice soft but laced with an edge. “What… what happened? Where did you find this child?”

Tarran rubbed the back of his neck, the weight of her stare pressing down on him. “I—uh—found him in the forest,” he said, his words coming out clumsily. “There was blood… a lot of blood. But it wasn’t his, I think. The scratches—” he gestured vaguely to the infant—“they’re nothing too deep. Just… I couldn’t leave him there. I couldn’t.”

His wife’s expression darkened with worry, but she held her tongue. For all her doubts, the thought of leaving a baby to die, alone and wailing in the woods, was unthinkable.

“Did anyone see you?” she asked quietly, glancing toward the windows as if expecting the village elders to appear on their doorstep.

“No. I made sure of that,” Tarran replied, his tone firm. “But… no one can know. Not yet.”

“I see,” she murmured, her gaze softening as she looked at the infant again. The child squirmed faintly, his cries now reduced to a pitiful whimper. “Well, let’s start with what we can do. We’ll tend to his wounds first. We’ll decide what to do after.”

She stepped aside, motioning for Tarran to bring the child inside. The house was dimly lit, with only a faint glow from the hearth casting long shadows on the walls. Tarran carefully laid the infant down on a makeshift bed—a folded woolen blanket on the kitchen table—while {wife's name} gathered supplies.

A wooden tub sat in the corner of the room, a relic of their daily lives. Water from the nearby stream, warmed over the hearth, was poured in with practiced ease. Bathing was not a frequent luxury, but it was a necessity for injuries and illnesses.

As Tarran stood awkwardly by, his wife shot him a sharp look. “Tarran, weren’t you supposed to carry medicines and bandages for emergencies like this? Especially out in the woods?”

“I—uh—well,” Tarran stammered, shifting uncomfortably. “I thought it’d be better not to… y’know… touch him too much.”

“By the gods, Tarran,” she muttered, exasperation creeping into her voice as she knelt by the child. “He’s covered in scratches, filthy, and shivering. You’re lucky he hasn’t caught his death already.”

Tarran didn’t argue. Instead, he watched in silence as she worked, her hands steady and careful as she began cleaning the infant’s wounds with a damp cloth. The scratches, though not deep, were so plentiful that it looked as though the boy had been caught in a fierce struggle with the forest itself—branches clawing at his skin with no mercy. Each mark told of desperation, of some grim ordeal Tarran couldn’t begin to piece together.

“What could have happened out there?” she muttered, more to herself than to him. “Who would leave a child like this in the forest?”

Tarran had no answers, only more questions. The unease he’d felt in the woods had followed him here, settling in the corners of the room like a shadow that refused to leave."

# Passive earplug including Helmholtz resonators arranged in series to achieve broadband near zero occlusion effect at low frequencies

The use of passive earplugs is often associated with the occlusion effect: a phenomenon described as the increased auditory perception of one's own physiological noise at low frequencies. As a notable acoustic discomfort, the occlusion effect penalizes the use and the efficiency of earplugs. This phenomenon is objectively characterized by the increase in sound pressure level in the occluded ear canal compared to the open ear canal. Taking inspiration from acoustic metamaterials, a new design of a three-dimensional printed “meta-earplug,” made of four Helmholtz resonators arranged in series, is proposed for achieving near zero objective occlusion effect measured on artificial ear in a broadband frequency range (300 Hz to 1 kHz). For this purpose, the geometry of the meta-earplug is optimized to achieve a null occlusion effect target based on an analytical model of the phenomenon. It results from the optimization process that the input impedance of the meta-earplug medial surface approximately matches the input impedance of the open ear canal, weighted by the ratio of volume velocity imposed by the ear canal wall to the ear canal cavity between open and occluded cases. Acoustic properties of the meta-earplug are also shown to significantly improve its sound attenuation at the piston-like mode of the system.

Did things get better for you?,Life,1i9botz,2025-01-24 20:25:36,5,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1i9botz/did_things_get_better_for_you/,jxnva,Need Advice,"TLDR I’m going through the hardest chapter of my life. Please share examples in your life where things got better, where losses set you up for better things. 

27F and I’ve had a really hard year. I ended a relationship 1 year ago with someone I deeply loved bc he stopped reciprocating effort, didn’t want to communicate through issues, etc. He moved on pretty quickly. I still feel hurt about the loss to this day. 

Through the heartbreak Ive had major health issues- I have a hormonal disorder that causes severe cystic acne, highly increases my risk of a bunch of other health issues like cancers. I was diagnosed a decade ago but had an acne flare up that lasted all of last year into today, although my skin is finally clearing up. I had attempted to lower my medication in preparation to maybe have a baby someday with my now ex partner. I live such a healthy lifestyle that I thought it would help manage my hormonal disorder. that didn’t work out and my symptoms came back. 

im struggling with the heartbreak of my uncontrollable health issue that I have to live with. It makes social connection feel so much heavier for me. I’m feeling stagnant in my life. im trying anything to bring newness into my life. I’ve kept up with my hobbies and career and fitness through the shittiness of it all. But everyday I feel hollow and empty. Ive crossed a threshold where I feel like I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel and I’ve just been going through the motions for so long now. I want to believe it will get better and will all make sense but I wonder if some people just never get there. "

For example, I think weapons, armor, and mounts are not long term profitable, because once players get one of these…they generally don’t need more except for level thresholds.  Once they get highest level they will only need the one.


I THINk food, scrolls, and alchemy are good for long term because they will be needed consistently.  Raids, PvP, etc…

Seems very unfriendly to new community members to me, so I'm happy I found this sub. Nonetheless, I would love to hear your feedback. Stay safe out there, friends!

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, everyone. This will be my first in a series of long posts documenting periods of what I suppose you would call “strangeness” throughout my life. I am going to try to be as detailed as possible without becoming too long-winded. If anyone has any questions, please leave them below, and I will be happy to clarify as much as possible.

I’m going to start with my childhood, since I believe going chronologically makes the most sense.

Here are a few cursory details that give some important context about the setting of some of these events and my life in general as a young child:

You can call me “Kip”. I am a 28 year old female living on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. I grew up in Mobile, AL -- an only-child born to two only-children. My home was in a small suburban area on the outer ring of the city. When I was little, my parents worked multiple jobs, so I spent a large amount of time with my mother’s parents who lived just a few minutes’ drive away. My grandparents lived down a gravel road on a half-acre plot of land. It was a very quiet spot. At night sometimes, you could even hear the coyotes howling down at the trash dump at the end of the road.

My mother’s parents were heavily involved in the church, and thus, so was I from a very early age. I was sheltered from a large amount of pop culture and media, and I attended private, church-run schools until second grade. Phrases like *“Harry Potter is teaching kids witchcraft”* and *“Pokémon is evil because it teaches kids about evolution”* were exchanged often in these small Bible-Belt, Sunday-school circles I was privy to. I’m not sure if I ever even heard the words *“alien”* or *“abduction”* until I was at least around eight or nine years old. You must understand that concepts like these didn’t even hold space in the minds of those I was surrounded by.

Nonetheless, I do remember one thing always being present in my world – a deep, primal, visceral fear of someone or some*thing* coming to take me during the night. I remember most of my dreams as a child being nightmarish, and for many years, I remember often having the same, vivid, horrifying dreams over, and over, and over again. I would often wake up screaming and crying for my mom. The only way I could go back to sleep was if I slept next to my parents. Most nights I ended up in my parents’ bed after a nightmare, and eventually I refused to sleep in my room at all. If I had to spend the night with my grandparents, I always slept next to one of them until they got a pull-out couch in their lounge when I was around eight or nine years old. Around that same time, my dad’s mom came to visit, and she and my parents took a whole week to give my bedroom a total makeover to try to make the space somewhere inviting for me. The room was everything a little girl could want… *and I hated myself because I couldn’t sleep in it.* I slept on the sofa or an air mattress on the living room floor because I suppose the “public-ness” of the space felt safer than the confines of my bedroom. My dogs could also sleep next to me and keep watch there, and that brought me comfort.

Recently, I have felt extremely compelled to share these dreams/nightmares with the public due to events that I will be discussing in further posts. These nightmares occurred so often and left such clear, haunting images in my mind that I still contemplate them to this day. I am genuinely curious if these scenarios or images feel familiar to anyone, and if any of you had similar unsolved behavioral issues as a child/adolescent.

The following is a list of the four recurring nightmares that I often experienced as a child, and concise descriptions of their settings and events.

***Nightmare I:***

This is one of the earliest nightmares I can remember. I’m standing in the middle of a desolate wasteland. There are no signs of life anywhere. Suddenly, hoards of animals start pouring over the horizon, running in terror for their lives. You can see the whites of their eyes and hear their cries. The sky is a burning orange as giant mushroom clouds rise in the distance. The light casts long dark shadows on the red ground, making it look like rivers of running blood.

***Nightmare II:***

I’m hiding from someone in what I believe to be my grandparents’ home. I’m in my grandfathers’ office, under a table, my back against the wall. I’m listening to hear if whoever is after me is going to come into the door to my right (the only door to the room), but suddenly, another “door” appears on the wall across from me. A blinding, golden light pours in from around the cracks and threshold as it opens. The light is so bright that I can barely look at it, even while squinting. I am absolutely frozen with fear. All I can see is a handful of tall, dark silhouettes slowly coming toward me through the doorway. Then, everything goes dark.

***Nightmare III:***

My grandfather and I are in his silver, single cab, Toyota Tacoma pickup truck as we pull up into the driveway of my childhood home. He tells me to wait in the truck as he goes inside to get my mom. As he gets about halfway down the driveway, the truck suddenly starts back up totally on its own. It shifts into drive and starts to back out. I’m panicking, but no one seems to notice. The truck slowly starts to drive out of my neighborhood and out of town, as I can do nothing but stare helplessly out the windows. I never make it to where we are going. Eventually everything just goes black.

***Nightmare IV:***

*(Just a warning… this one is incredibly bizarre. I am very curious to see if any elements of it resonate with anyone out there!)*

My grandparents and I are taking a trip to their small, local “fruit stand”/produce market where my grandmother often bought most of her fruits and vegetables. As we are entering, I see a family struggling to get a wheelchair into their van. I leave my grandparents’ side to go and help – something I would never actually do in real life because I knew better. They are very kind and appreciative of my help, and give me warm, welcoming smiles. I tell them I was happy to help, but before I can even turn away to leave, they snatch me and pull me into the van with them. I am paralyzed with fear, thinking these people are going to harm me, but they just keep smiling at me and telling me that everything is just fine. (There are two “parents” and one “child” that is in the wheelchair.) We drive down winding roads until I don’t know where I am or for how long we have been traveling. They keep me in their “home” for who knows how long. It seems like days. I am not allowed outside. They would make us sit down to meals together like we were a family. They act like humans, but something just seems off about their behavior. All I can remember is constantly asking to go home. Each of the “family members” promises me that they are *“going to take me back, but not yet.”* When I ask when, they reply *“soon”* or *“eventually.”* One day, the “family” decides to take a trip back to the fruit stand, and they allow me to come with them. We drive for what seems to be a very long time. When we arrive, the “family members” and I all enter the building, and to my amazement, I spot my grandparents and my mother on the other side of the store. As if I am suddenly freed from invisible shackles, I run as fast as I can back to my mom and try to explain to her what has happened to me and where I’ve been. When I look back, the “family” is gone. Their van is not in the parking lot. There is no sign that they ever even existed. I don’t care. I am just happy to be back with my mom and grandparents. This is where the dream ends.

***Honorable Mention:***

*(This is not a recurring nightmare, but one that so greatly frightened me that I remember being upset for days afterward, and even recounting the dream to a Sunday school teacher because I feared the being I saw was some kind of evil entity.)*

It’s the middle of the night, and for some reason I’m suddenly fully awake. I am laying on the pull-out mattress in my grandparents’ lounge. The house is eerily silent. The moon must be incredibly low and full, because I can see the bright, pale gray rays piercing through the blinds of the windows behind me. My eyes are drawn to the door leading into the room. I always slept with this door closed. The door slowly, and silently starts to open, which is basically impossible to do because of how it likes to stick. Upon fully opening, an ominous, pitch-black silhouette of a massive deer stag steps into frame. I can’t even see the uppermost tines of its antlers because the beast is so tall. Its eyes are bright, red, squinted almonds, and its gaze seems to pierce right into my soul. I am pinned to the mattress with terror, and I can’t move. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. The stag starts to enter the room, and I feel as though my heart is going to explode out of my chest. Then, everything goes black.

\------

After years of contemplation, reading accounts from others, and having other unexplainable events happen throughout my life, I can’t help but wonder if these are so called “screen memories” or simply the way that my brain has tried to make sense of what I have seen in reality. Whatever they are, I do believe they have some connection with the abduction phenomenon and encounters with NHI. Many things have brought me to this conclusion that I will be going more detail into in later posts. I will be making following posts about my “experiences”, but I thought it may be best to keep the dreams to a post of their own.

This will actually be my first ever post I have made, myself. I have commented on others’ post before, but never made my own. I am planning on submitting this to r/dreams, r/AlienAbduction, r/InterdimensionalNHI, r/HighStrangeness and r/Experiencers . If there are any other subreddits you all feel may be a good place to post, please let me know! I am looking forward to any feedback I receive! There isn’t any turning back for me at this point.

Cheers and Love <3

Made my first ESP Home sensor!,homeassistant,1i9aewv,2025-01-24 19:23:51,77,0.95,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1i9aewv/made_my_first_esp_home_sensor/,shadow13499,,"https://preview.redd.it/5xkcymli81fe1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e85ae9335924a9ca4375bd23d878115a70d902db

Hey everyone, I wanted to share my first ever self made ESP Home sensor! It’s a motion, light, temp, and humidity sensor. Here’s the parts I used:

* LD2420 mmwave sensor
* DHT22 temp & humidity sensor
* Photoresistor and a 1k ohm resistor
* D1 Mini ESP32

In total it cost me about $20 to build and works really well. Definitely a good deal considering other similar devices cost around twice as much. It’s not the prettiest build ever but it won’t matter too much once it’s inside an enclosure (that I still have to build). If anyone else is interested here’s the config I used:

    substitutions:
      # UART Pin configured for a D1 Mini stacked setup
      uart_tx_pin: GPIO19
      # TX Pin configured for a D1 Mini stacked setup

Originally I wanted to have a PIR sensor on there like the EP1, but the mmwave sensor was actually quicker at detecting presence than the PIR sensor so I decided to leave it off. I’ll probably use the PIR for something else.

I’ll test this one out and probably make a few more. I might try and order a professionally made PCB board I can put all my components into to make it look a little nicer."

Exhausted Beyond any Words Can Express 😞,SpicyAutism,1i99hft,2025-01-24 18:39:49,20,0.95,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpicyAutism/comments/1i99hft/exhausted_beyond_any_words_can_express/,KrystalThePiztol,,"I feel like I’m losing my mind. 

I have a 16 week old Malshipoo who I love and adore, but is exacerbating my burnout beyond my capacity. I feel so bad because I want him to have the best life, but I’m so drained and I’m forgetting about my own well being and needs. I don’t shower every day. I don’t eat regularly. My sleep is pretty jacked up too because he sleeps in the bed now. (And before anyone says put him in a crate, we tried ALL the methods, but he would drool so bad from anxiety and shove his mouth through the bars, that we just stopped so he wouldn’t hurt himself and make things worse.) I tried a play pen too, but there’s something about being confined he just FREAKS over. 

The sleeping arrangement isn’t even the issue anymore. It’s all the time and the 24/7 demand and me being at home with him ALL DAY alone. It’s me and him from 0700-1600. My partner gets home from work and is exhausted from work, so lots of times, I’m still with him, ALONE. I don’t really go anywhere, I don’t have many friends. It’s just me and puppers 95% of the time. I also have ADHD, am in college (Programming 1 and a business course), transitioning from the military, and in a relationship. I’m EXHAUSTED. 😔

Silly me, I thought he would be a good ESA before we adopted him. I feel foolish though because when I read about his breed now (Maltese, Shih Tzu and Poodle), I see the same thing over and over that they’re companion dogs and can be pretty clingy. 

Today I was trying to get him to stop biting and humping me and I was so fed up from exhaustion and mental fatigue I started crying and punching myself a few times. Once in my leg, once on both sides of my head kinda like a tambourine. I feel so embarrassed by my actions and like I’m not EVER meant to take care of anything that’s requires too much of my cognitive functioning. 😣 I’m struggling badly.

I feel like something is so so wrong with me. I have had approximately 4-5 breakdowns since having him and we’ve only had him since 8 weeks old. I don’t want to get rid of him because I love him so much, but every time I feel this way about him and my tolerance threshold, I begin to self loathe and think he should be re-homed. 

Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated.

Bitcoin ETFs In Focus As Kansas Senator Proposes Up To 10% Pension Fund Allocation,Blockviews,1i99fzs,2025-01-24 18:37:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i99fzs/bitcoin_etfs_in_focus_as_kansas_senator_proposes/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Kansas Proposes Bitcoin for Retirement Portfolios  

Kansas might soon get a crypto twist in its retirement plans! Senator Craig Bowser has put forth Senate Bill 34, a proposal to allow the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) to allocate up to 10% of its funds into $BTC exchange-traded fund products. If approved, this would mark a significant shift in the way public employee retirement funds are managed.  

The bill goes all in on local support, suggesting that only Kansas-based investment firms would be eligible to issue the $BTC ETFs. One interesting caveat: the KPERS board won’t need to sell off Bitcoin if its value exceeds the 10% threshold unless it’s in the best interest of beneficiaries. To keep the strategy in check, an annual review would be required, with results sent directly to the governor.  

Bitcoin seems to be gaining favor in state-level economic plans across the US. With North Dakota exploring $BTC for inflation control and Oklahoma proposing to pay salaries in cryptocurrency, the winds of change are blowing nationwide. Even Massachusetts is rumored to be eyeing $BTC reserves.  

That said, not everyone’s on board. The Federal Reserve remains vocal about its opposition to the Bitcoin train. While critics debate, the market stays unfazed — $BTC is currently trading at $105,486, up 0.7% in the last 24 hours.  

Has Kansas sparked a new wave of crypto optimism among state governments? Eyes are now on lawmakers as the bill begins its journey through the legislative process.

How I typically save $100-$200/mo on leases without losing my sanity. Open-sourcing my method.,leasehacker,1i991ix,2025-01-24 18:19:17,44,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/leasehacker/comments/1i991ix/how_i_typically_save_100200mo_on_leases_without/,iamasharat,,"\[Note: this post was initially removed. Justifiably. Re-posting in compliance with the rules of the community. Hope this is helpful to you.\]

# TL;DR

1. Decide on the model and trim. Be flexible on color. 
2. Determine good lease terms. You want to negotiate final monthly payment all in with zero down, and zero drive-offs. Be flexible on lease length. 
3. Create a spreadsheet with all dealers within a reasonable distance (100 miles is generally good)
4. Create a new email (Gmail is great for this) and phone number (Google Voice is best)
5. Contact dealers by filling out the contacts form on their site and tell them precisely what you are looking for.
6. As much as you can shift conversations with dealers to texting
7. Be polite, but keep insisting on your terms.
8. Once you get the offer you’ve requested, get the car immediately.
9. Turn off notifications for that phone and email. #Congratulations.

**Origins**  
I’ve been leasing vehicles for a while now, but I am an introvert and absolutely hate negotiating with dealers in person. I am also really bothered when I know I’ve been taken advantage of and have overpaid. 

Note that this also works when buying instead of leasing. Instead of a monthly payment, you negotiate the purchase price, and most other steps are the same.

So, I developed a method for myself—a method by which I get a price I feel good about, and it is in a format that works for me—mainly negotiating via text. And it worked.

I just leased a Honda Prologue Touring, where some offered $450/mo with $3k due at signings\* (I asked why so high, and explanation was it’s such an in-demand vehicle that it sells above MSRP, which is an obvious pile of dung), most were not budging from nationally advertised $289/mo with $3,199 due at signings, but I ended up getting $307/mo all-in with zero down. Previously, I leased a Nissan Murano that most dealers were offering for  $410/mo + $4,089 due on signing; some offered $410/mo all in, but I ended up getting $325/mo. 

All of my other past cars follow the same story. It worked well enough that I started helping family, friends, and then friends of friends. Now, I am sharing how I do it with you in the hopes that it will help other people like me.

Will this help you get such a good deal that the dealer will be losing money? Not likely. But it will help you get a deal where you are not leaving much money on the table. 

Disclaimer: Yes, there are better methods. Yes, some things I write are not as precise. I am trying to make this as easy and replicable as possible without you spending too much time delving into the “science” of things.

# Full explanation/how to

Warning: it's long 🙂 Tried to condense as much as I could. If you want to try this method you can read/do in stages, and can generally skim for things that are new/relevant. I meant it when I said I want to open-source everything I know.

\### Model and Trim ### 

Settle on model and trim. Be flexible on color and options. Why? Simply because it will allow you to land a better deal. 

What advantage does one dealer have over another? Location is the primary one; most people don’t want to go far. If you negotiate by walking into the dealership, as they prefer you do, and they keep you there for an absurdly long time, you won’t go somewhere else. But if you negotiate via phone/text and are willing to travel a little bit further, then there is no advantage one dealer has over another. They all sell the same cars. Just like all phone stores sell the same iPhones. Would you care what store your phone came from? So, what do they do? They try to get you to “fall in love” with a specific trim+color+options combo that other dealers may not have. This way, they can present the car they have as a unique item rather than a commodity. Don’t fall for that. 

Unless you are a diva or living in Glendale and need to drive a black BMW 🙂, do you really care about color? Are there some options you absolutely can’t live without? If the answer is yes, this method will still work, but maybe not as well if there is a limited inventory of what you are looking for. 

So, yeah, Model and Trim, keep all else optional.

\### Lease Terms ### 

I’ll present several methods for arriving at what a decent deal looks like. To save you time, the easiest method is usually good and close enough.

Method 1 - Easiest: Go on leasehackr (leasehackr dot com) and look at closed deals in your area. You need to have a paid account. 

Pay for 1 month, only $15/mo, and it is so worth it given time savings, not to mention how much you’ll save on a better lease. So pay for membership for a month only when you are leasing and cancel right after  (sorry, leasehackr). 

Disclaimer: I don’t work for or am in any way affiliated with leasehackr other than being a happy user. 

Method 2 - Easy: Go on leasehackr and look up lease offers from brokers. Then, take that price to dealers (minus the typical $599 broker fee). Or, just go with the broker. I’ve been aggregating a list of brokers. DM me if you’d like the list, and I’ll share it when it’s ready. 

The downsides I see in working with a broker are: 1. You can actually get a better deal by following this method, and that’s before saving yourself $599 broker fee. But not by a lot, it’s really how much your time is worth to you.

2. They have a limited supply of cars they have access to and are not transparent if they no longer have the car. For example, they can say yes, get you to fill out the leasing docs, when the car has already been promised to someone else, and they are just waiting until it closes. You are just a contingency and waiting without any clarity. If you are trying to time end of month or quarter (good) or end of year (best), this can actually screw you up quite a bit.

Method 3 - Easy but crapshoot: look at lease “deals” advertised on the company’s main US site (the car company, not some dealer’s), add 10% and just ask for the same monthly all-in with zero down. For example, Honda is advertising (as of this writing) 2024 Prologue AWD Touring $289/mo for 24 mos with $3,199 due at signing. So $289+$28.9 (10%) = $317.9. I got that car for $307, but $317 is still a good deal.

Method 4 - Hardest: Identify car’s invoice price (Edmunds is good, and just generally googling), and then use leasehackr calculator to identify all applicable incentives and it will give you what a good lease looks like. This requires quite a bit more work, and honestly most times the end result is not necessarily worth the time, unless you can qualify for a ton of programs. 

\### Zero down all in ### 

When you calculate what the good deal looks like, you want structure your payment as zero down and final price all in (i.e. inclusive of all fees and taxes). Why?

Dealers will always be trying to get you to come in to negotiate in person. So they might say “yes”, I’ll give you your terms, but then will come up with “drive offs”, “fees”. Will try to look innocent and say “yes, it is 300/mo, but you still need to cover fees and taxes”. Also, there are many elements to how the lease payment is calculated: MSRP, incentives, money factor, residual, etc. Some things you can do nothing about, e.g. residual and money factor (those are usually set by the financing arm of the car company), MSRP and incentives is where you have leverage. But you don’t want to be arguing every line, and you don’t really care how the payment you are looking for is arrived at; you just want that final payment. It’s easiest to negotiate one final monthly [number.To](http://number.To) summarize:

1. No money down or drive-offs
2. Calculate and ask for a monthly payment that is already inclusive of all fees and taxes

\### Don’t use round numbers ### 

When calculating your target number or getting comps, it will be a nonround number, e.g. 307. So actually use that non-round number. Don’t go 300 or 310. Chris Voss in his book Never Split the Difference has a good explanation. Basically, it lends credibility to the number and shows it was researched.

\### Lease length ### 

A big factor that impacts the lease payment is the residual. It is how much the car is worth at the end of the lease. It is a % of car’s MSRP. Residuals are set by car companies, they are different for each make, model, trim and year of production. Tell dealer you are open to any length, as long as it ends up being the lowest amount. Sometimes it is 24 months, sometimes 39. Tell dealer you are open to any length. 

\### Credit score ### 

The deal you get will, of course, depend on your credit score. Dealers think of credit scores as tiers, and the thresholds are set by financing companies, not dealers. Tier 1 is 750+ or sometimes 700+, Tier 2 is 660+, and up to Tier 1. 

I’ve only personally worked on deals for people with Tier 1 and 2 credit scores. If you are below Tier 2, you will not get as good of a deal, but I don’t have personal data on how much higher you should expect to pay.

If you have a relative, best friend, or someone who trusts you and has a better score, ask them to be primary, and get added as secondary. The dealer will count the top score and give you the deal based on that, and in the meantime, you are making regular car payments and raising your own score. I always do this to help my relatives and friends, for I know I’ll be good on paymetns, and they will get a credit score boost. 

\### Dealers to approach ### 

Create a list of all dealers within reasonable driving distance. I usually start with under 100 miles. Have once leased from a dealer 160 miles, but it was so worth it. 

1. Sometimes, you can copy+paste from car maker’s website once you enter your zipcode. 
2. Most times, you’ll need to spend some time doing manual data entry, or scraping the web if you are somewhat technical. 
3. Other than the carmaker’s own site, autotrader is a good start.
4. I’ve been aggregating lists. DM, and I can see if I already have a list of dealers in your area.

You want to get the dealer’s name, address, and website. 

\###  Start contacting dealers ### 

Once you have your list of dealers in place, and all research done, draft an message to dealers. You’ll be copy+pasting it into web contact forms. 

Your message must include:

1. Model and trim you want and that you are flexible on color.
2. Payment terms you are looking for
3. Share your email and phone, and say you prefer texting
4. Make it clear you want to lease asap

Be sure to create a new email (ideally gmail) and phone number (Burner, Text+, Google voice) for this. Why? Cause they will continue spamming you non-stop after you’ve gotten the car. It is easiest to shut down those channels if they are new. 

Once you have all of the above, start going to your target dealer’s website one by one, and filling out the contact form. This is an annoying manual process, but won’t take you more than 30 mins if you have your list and email copy in place. 

\###  Why contact so many dealers? ### 

* Negotiation power. This is the most critical aspect of contacting so many dealers. Unless you are great at negotiations, I take it you are not cause you are still reading; the best negotiation power you have comes from being able to walk away. Your walkaway power comes from having options, and options come from contacting quite a few dealers. 
* You need to contact enough dealers to get the price you want.
* Some dealers specialize in specific models and can make you the best deal. It’s hard to find this out in advance via research, so it's best just to contact enough dealers. 
* Some dealers have more inventory of the car you want and would be more interested in pushing it. You can search through their inventories, etc, but it is easiest just to contact and ask.
* They could have one leftover car from the current year (it happens the most if you are trying to get a car at the end of the year), and they will likely want to get rid of it fast. Again, instead of searching for inventory, just ask for a deal and see what they say.
* Some fraction of the dealers will insist you go in to discuss prices, and that is what you are trying to avoid. Contact enough, and you will find enough dealers willing to negotiate terms by phone/text. 

\###  What will happen next? ### 

* You will start getting a ton of phone calls, emails, and text messages. 
* Best to respond to text messages and emails in batches. Google Voice is great for this usecase, for they have a web client and it’s a lot easier to do a lot of texting on computer than mobile. 
* Best to have your standard responses saved somewhere so tha you can easily copy+paste.
* You will be doing a lot of calling, texting and emailing. But ideally for no more than two days, close a good deal, and be done with it. So plan for that. 
* 70-30:
   * In 70% of the cases, you will negotiate some dealer down to your price. 
   * In another 30% of cases, you will come across a dealer who will say:”Yup, giving you your terms, come and get the car” from the start and it will be that easy. I hope you end up in this 30%. 

\### IMPORTANT - To get a deal, you need to deal ### 

After you’ve done everything above, the next most important thing you must do to secure a good deal is to signal to dealers you are ready to close the deal right away. Why is that?Dealers are people, they want to get paid and they want to get paid now. This is no longer a business where long-term relationship building is important. This is now a purely transactional environment, and they want to close the transaction right away. (Again, there will be a ton of redditors with their expert contradictory view and evidence. Good for you! But really, just assume it’s purely transactional environment, act on that assumption, and you will get the best deal.)

So, how do you signal you are ready to deal?

* Put that into your message that you submit on the dealer’s site. Say that you want to get the car asap, this weekend, by this date, etc. 
* Respond to phone calls. While I hate doing this, cause again it is the usual dealer salesiness that is like nails on chalkboard for me (I assume you too, reader, since you’ve gotten this far), it is important. Just be ready with your answers (suggestions below, I wouldn’t leave you hanging), and you’ll be fine. 
   * You can re-enforce you are ready to deal when you talk on the phone
   * You show you are a real person, not someone spamming/phishing online
   * You have a way to transition to text messing
* Respond to text messages fast. Dealers have a ton of other people they are trying to close. Don’t expect them to remember you. By responding fast, you stay on top of their mind and signal you are ready to close the deal. Dealers will not try to offer a good deal to someone they think is just kicking the tires. 
* Emails. Most emails will be from some outsourced labor who will be trying to get you to set up an appointment to go there in person. Just keep responding politely that you are ready to discuss terms, and it’s best to call or text you. But eventually, you will be redirected to an actual salesperson, and they might communicate by email with you. Great! But single channel is best, and ask if they can text you instead, so you can respond faster.
* When can you come in? Everyone will be asking to go in. Respond that once the terms are agreed upon, you will come in immediately or the following day when they open, tonight before closing at 8pm, etc. Let me re-iterate, tell the dealer plainly and directly that once the terms are reached, you will go in to sign and take the car right away. And do that. Or the car might go away, especially if you scored an extra good deal.
* Why are you getting another car? Many will ask you why you are getting a car now to see if there is an external pressure to close the deal right away. Again, they don’t want tire kickers. Truth is simplest and best, and for you it will likely be because (1) your other lease is expiring, (2) your other car died and you need another asap, or (3) you are trying to take advantage of the current deals. Whatever it is, have an answer ready that shows you are ready to deal. 

\### Do you need a lease printout to know you have a deal offer? ### 

1. Some dealers will send you a picture of a printout with a  table that shows your lease offer and options, e.g. monthly payment based on money down and duration. [Like this.](https://monosnap.com/file/TZiLmAYzD5wi9fms3VdZHKVuhaxT08)
2. Some will send you full printout that shows the car’s MSRP, minus rebate, plus fees and options, etc, and what monthly payment it ends up being (these are minority). [Like this.](https://monosnap.com/file/XvVRNXv25SzkzpUPCCU1i4HnoJjwCK)
3. Some will just email/text you terms as text, e.g., I can do 400/mo plus tax for 24/10. [Like this.](https://monosnap.com/file/kQP1RTRwTubPAmiTD6jQQwi9EqPjUa)

It’s best when you have #1 and #2, but I have closed about 50% of the deals with just #3. Some I even closed without that. The dealer would give me terms by phone (so I had nothing in writing, not that it’s binding in any way, but really no confirmation other than what the dealer said on the phone), and I’d say, “Great, I am on my way.” And only once was there a “hiccup,” but I still ended up getting the promised deal.

Here is what happened. The dealer promised me the car; I went there, and he kept saying the car is coming and the paperwork was worked on. Then he goes, “Oh man, sorry, apparently the car was sold, just got confirmation. But I have another one, it’s the same trim just different color. And it’s going to be more expensive.” I asked why it is more expensive; his explanation was “Cause it will be more expensive.” By his tenseness (later, I learned it was his 3rd month on the job) and nonsensical explanation, I guessed he was just trying to get more money out of me. Annoying, really annoying. Yes, I wanted to get up, deliver something in “French,” and storm out. But I was there already and might as well try. So, I used Chris Voss’ suggestions again and said, “We had a deal. I held up my end and arrived right away to close it. I just want what’s fair. ” And then I just waited and looked at him. Silence is a great negotiation tactic. I hate negotiations; it was tough, but I held, and it worked. He got up to “confirm with his boss”, returned 5 mins later, and gave me the original terms. 

Can dealers promise you something just to get you to come in, then bait-and-switch. Yes! Unfortunately, the best answer is to feel those out. These types of dealers will say, “Yes, come in with your best offer, and we will see what we can do,” “Yes, we can work out an offer,” “Yes, I’ll do my best,” etc. If you noticed, in such responses, they sound like they agree, but they are not actually saying anything concrete, like terms or saying, “Yes, we will give you your terms.” “Yes, I will match your terms” sounds similar but a lot more concrete than “Yes, come in, and we will do our best.” 

It is reasonably easy to spot, and you need to be especially on the lookout for such a dynamic when talking to a further away dealer. If you drive for 10 mins and the deal falls through, whatever. If you drive for an hour and it falls through, it will be a bloody maddening hour ride back. 

So, yeah, you don’t need to get a text or email of the lease offer printout to get a deal; just make sure you have a deal and not a sneaky “promise to do best.”. 

\### How dealers will respond and what you should say/do ### 

Come in for a test drive -  every dealer, and I mean, EVERY dealer, will try to get you to come in person. Why? Many reason, but putting it simply - it puts them into an advantage and you not. Some will say they offer terms only if you come in person - cross those out in your tracking spreadsheet. Most will offer you to come in for a test drive:

* You should have already done the test drive. Say thank you, I already test-drove that model, like it, so ready to discuss terms by phone or, better yet, text. 
* This is an opportunity for them to get you to “fall in love” with a specific car, and transition you to thinking they have a unique item you want (as discussed above). 

We only offer deals / terms in person - be polite, just say “I understand, thank you for your time. Good bye.” And then cross them off your list. From my experience about 30% of them come back and still offer the terms by phone, but they never end up being the best deals. Plus, will you really feel good giving your business to someone who BSed you from the very beginning?

How did you come up with the number - Because you will be looking for a good deal, it will be below any publicly advertised deal. One of the dealer’s strategies will be to gaslight you, to convince you your expectations are wrong. Say “I looked online, at leasehackr, what others are leasing for, did research on incentives and deals, so this is what I should be able to get.” 

* This section is the most critical script to prepare for because as long as you signal well that you are ready to deal, this is what the whole negotiation is about - the money.
* They will keep questioning your number and expectations. It will be done via “clarifications”. Typical follow-on “clarifications” are “How much are you looking to put down?” and “Are you ok paying taxes and fees upfront”. The goal is to make you insecure about what you are asking for and give in to putting money down or agreeing that the initial monthly you wanted is exclusive of taxes and fees.
   * Be polite but firm
   * Just repeat, “Yes, X is my target, it is all in, zero down”. Don’t say/explain more. 
   * If you researched well and are asking for something reasonable, you shouldn’t feel uncomfortable about asking for it

Are you willing to go higher - Most will tell you what you are looking for is impossible, and are you willing to go higher. Here, they are trying to get you to negotiate with yourself, basically name numbers without throwing any numbers themselves. Don’t! Instead, say, “Ok, you won’t meet my terms; what is the best YOU can offer?” 

* If the offer is close enough, consider taking it (cause money value of time), or say, “Thank you. Let me get back to you tomorrow if I don’t close on my terms until then.” They will often get back to you with terms you want to close the deal. 
* In most cases, it will be shitty publicly advertised offer. Just say “Thank you for you time. Best to you.” and cross them off your list. Most will get back to you with a better deal, but those are rarely good. 
   * Also, due to the admittedly unhealthy side of my psyche, I’d much rather give my business to someone who right away offers good (even if slightly higher than my target) terms than to someone who names a high price and tries to convince that’s the best that’s possible then somehow miraculously comes down to my pricing. Yes, this is negotiations; this is the game. But I don’t have to like it. And I really really don’t like it. So yeah, a big part of this method is getting a good deal, with the least pain, and from someone I feel good about giving my business to. 

What can I do to earn your business? - Some dealers will ask that while not offering the terms you want. The answer is simple: “Offer me what I am looking for.”

\### Shopping offers around ### 

TL;DR: Don’t.

Many dealers will ask you if you have other offers, and they will ask you to send the printouts from other dealers. Why?

* The main one is to verify you have an offer on hand they have to compete with and not blowing smoke.
* Sometimes, they want to see, if you are given not just lease pricing but the full breakdown, how the other dealer arrived at certain payment. For example, they’d want to see if there are offers/incentives they forgot to include to get to that number. You are probably assuming dealers know every offer/incentive and you’d be wrong. 
   * Many automakers now offer Conquest incentives - extra rebates for owners of certain vehicle. Cadillac offers it to current owners of luxury cars like Mercedes and BMW, Honda targets Toyota and Nissan. Only \~50% of sales people will try to see if you qualify for such an incentive. Beats me why, it doesn't reduce their commission in any way.

Should you share? I never do and I’d suggest you don’t as well.

If your target lease payment is well researched or at least based on reasonable comps, then it doesn’t matter if you have an offer on hand yet or not. You will get it. If you do have an offer on hand, say that you do, but still don’t share it. My personal view is it is unfair to dealers who gave you an offer if you shop it around. When many dealers won’t make you an offer unless you turn up in person, you should treat well and incentivize those who will meet you on your turf. 

Another personal rule of mine, I go for the best offer that came from the dealer it was easiest to work with, even if someone later matches or even beats it. 

* If you set a reasonable target, you shouldn’t leave much money on the table. So a better offer won’t be that much better. I’d rather pay more to dealers who don’t give me the runaround.
* If someone matches your best offer, the fair thing to do is to go with the dealer who made you the offer first. 

Here are some scripts for this situation:

* “Do you have offers that match your terms?” Answer: 
   * If you have one: “Yes :)”
   * If you don’t have one: “No (be honest, no reason to state anything else), but talking to other dealers, so I am sure I’ll get one soon.”
* “Send me the other offer, and I’ll see what I can do.” Answer: “I think it’s unfair to the dealer to shop their offer. You know what I am looking for. If you can’t offer that, give me your best offer.”
* “I can’t match your offer until you send me printout from the other dealer.” Answer: “Thank you very much for your time. Best to you.”
   * \~50% of these will come back to you with an offer…Hmmmm…I thought they couldn’t make you an offer until you show a printout from someone else, but now they can??? How annoying is that? Be polite, hate the game, but be polite. (see next section)

\### Be polite ### 

It's too obvious and stupid even to mention this, but no matter what, be polite. 

There will be many instances where you just want to cuss out the dealer. Be polite. 

It is hard to maintain composure when someone is trying to swindle you. Be polite. 

It’s not out of nowhere that only Members of Congress and Telemarketers beat out car salespeople as least honest (according to a [2020 Gallup pol](https://news.gallup.com/poll/467804/nurses-retain-top-ethics-rating-below-2020-high.aspx)l). Still, be polite. Politicians and Telemarketers - cuss those $%&#ers to your heart's content. To car salespeople - be polite. 

I offer three reasons:

1. Ignore that feeling of anger that bubbles up whenever we see ourselves being lied to. You are there for the deal; play the game. As long as you do your research and get your terms, you got a good deal. Feel good about that and forget the rest. 
2. Most importantly, car salespeople are people too, they are trying to earn a living and were put into a system that teaches, grooms, and incentivizes the behavior and practices we hate. Hate the game system, not the player dealer. It feels personal, it’s not. 
3. Not likely, but in two-three years, you might come across them again. 

\### Why I developed this method for myself ### 

I like behavioral economics, and surprise surprise a lot of examples in the field come from tricks dealers play and why they work. Plus, likely a product of upbringing, I am driven mad whenever I feel someone is taking advantage of me. Even if I rectify or don’t let it happen, it still weighs on me for a long time after. On top of that, I am an introvert, and negotiations are like pulling teeth for me. 

Just the thought of going into a dealership, spending a stupid amount of time just waiting while the salesperson is in the back “getting approval from the boss”, noticing the “games played” that I read about, seeing how a person in front of me is clearly just trying to see how much they can milk out of me - that all feels me with angs, anger, and anxiety. Having to actually do that, and then drive every day the car that reminds me of how I was taken for a ride - would have been healthier to just take a bus. You can probably guess that I’ve had bad experiences. 

But I still needed a car, so I went about figuring out how to get a good deal (so that it doens’t weigh on me after) and minimize the experiences that drive me [nuts.Now](http://nuts.Now) you have all my knowledge. Hope it helps you too. 

\### Disclaimer: Are dealers bad people ### 

No, I don’t they are. I feel they employ, if not bad, at least questionable tactics and methods. The fact that they employ them and get away with it still does not make them bad people. In my opinion, it is a failure of our economic system and our society as a whole. The same things and worse are happening in many other industries; most people just don’t come across them, but everyone needs a car. The cause is deeper than simply labeling dealers as bad people. 

\### Why do I like leasing? ### 

Time saving. When you have a new car these days and only keep it for 2-3 years, most are reliable and will need no maintenance. One oil change, and that’s it.

If I get a good lease deal and then factor in the money and time cost of having to keep up an older car (oil changes, tires, brakes, random troubles), the difference in cost is small enough that it’s not worth the trouble. Hence, leasing.

I lease my primary commute cars. My special fun toy is my motorcycle; I’d rather spend my time on her. 

\### How to improve ### 

The goal for this method is to get a great deal without spending time on irrelevant things, things that ultimately won't make a big different in results.

If you have suggestions that can simplify and/or improve outcomes tangibly, we all would be grateful.

I would like to cheer her up so I’ve been looking online for stores around Los Angeles and finally found one store that has 2 left. Great! You need to hit a price threshold for free shipping so I was going to pick up a Fergus frog for myself. Well, shipping wasn’t working for some reason but store pick up is available. I don’t feel like driving but I’ll do it. Where is it? Next to the other big fire! That’s probably why the store still has them listed but now I can’t really be sure of the state of the Jellies, or if I can even drive there. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!"
The Skylight Zone: Part VIII: Beyond the Final Star.,u_TheSkyLightZone,1i98524,2025-01-24 17:39:05,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/kqvatf5rr0fe1.jpeg,TheSkyLightZone,,"The Skylight Zone: Part VIII: Beyond the Final Star


There is a dimension beyond life and death, a space where echoes of past choices converge with the possibilities of tomorrow. In this place, every memory is a star, every regret a shadow, and every decision a ripple in the infinite expanse of the unknown. Tonight, Jonathan Gale will learn that even at the edge of existence, the threads of his past are not yet severed. Welcome to the Skylight Zone.



Jonathan Gale opened his eyes to a void of shimmering stars. He floated weightlessly, his body translucent, glowing faintly like a fragment of starlight. Around him, constellations pulsed gently, whispering fragments of voices—his own.



“Welcome back, seeker.”



The voice was melodic yet resonant, like the hum of distant galaxies. Jonathan turned to see a figure made of constellations, their form shifting with every movement. Their eyes, twin supernovas, burned with a depth he couldn’t comprehend.



“Where am I?” Jonathan asked.

“You’ve arrived at the Stellar Convergence,” the figure replied. “A crossroads for travelers like you—those who drift between life and what lies beyond.”



Jonathan frowned. “Am I dead?”



“Not entirely. But you are no longer bound by time.”



As the figure spoke, the stars shifted, forming fragments of Jonathan’s past. He saw himself stepping into the café for the first time, the chime of the bell cutting through the silence. Mabel stood behind the counter, her silver hair shimmering like moonlight as she poured tea into a porcelain cup.



“Ah, déjà vu,” her voice echoed through the void. “Funny how it feels like we’ve all been here before, isn’t it?”



The café dissolved, replaced by the towering clocktower with its exposed gears grinding against time. Jonathan saw himself standing before it, his heart heavy with the weight of choices unmade.



“You tampered with time,” the constellation figure said, their voice layered with echoes of his thoughts. “Every decision left a mark, and now those marks have followed you here.”



The stars rippled again, showing Jonathan as the wooden nutcracker trapped in the toy shop. The carousel spun in the background, its grotesque figures casting distorted shadows across the walls.



Jonathan shuddered. “Why am I seeing this?”



“These are the echoes of your journey,” the figure explained. “But here, at the Convergence, echoes are only that—shadows of the past. To move forward, you must let them go.”



A brilliant light flared nearby, and Jonathan saw Nyx standing in the observatory, her hourglass glowing faintly as she gazed into the swirling cosmos. Her reflection fractured into countless versions of herself, each one staring back with a mix of curiosity and fear.



“Jonathan,” she called, her voice like a bell tolling in the void. “Every choice we’ve made, every path we didn’t take—they’ve all led us here.”



Jonathan reached out toward her, but the scene dissolved, leaving him inside an immense space station suspended in the void. Its corridors stretched endlessly, lined with mirrors that reflected not his current form but every version of himself: the weary traveler, the nutcracker puppet, the man lost in the labyrinth of time.



“This is the Terminal,” the constellation figure said. “Each mirror holds an echo of who you were, but only one path lies ahead. You must choose.”



Jonathan approached one of the mirrors. It showed him sitting in the café, talking to Nyx as shadows danced across the flickering candlelight. Another mirror showed him trapped in the nutcracker’s body, spinning endlessly on the carousel. A third revealed him holding the hourglass in the observatory, staring into infinite versions of himself.



“It’s all still there,” he whispered. “Every moment, every choice.”



“They are threads,” the figure said, extending a hand. In their palm was an orb swirling with galaxies. “Your life is a weave, Jonathan, but threads can only take you so far. Take this, and the door will open.”



Jonathan turned to see a glowing doorway at the end of the Terminal. Beyond it lay a swirling expanse of stars, galaxies colliding in a brilliant dance.



“What’s beyond the door?” he asked.



“Possibility,” the figure replied.



Jonathan hesitated. His reflection in the nearest mirror spoke.



“You’ve already made this journey,” it said. “Every step you’ve taken has led you here. But to move forward, you must let go of the past.”



The mirrors began to shatter, their shards dissolving into starlight. Jonathan turned to Nyx, who now stood beside him. Her hourglass was empty, its sand suspended mid-air.



“You don’t have to do this alone,” she said softly.



Jonathan nodded, gripping the orb tightly. “What if I fail?”



“Failure,” the figure replied, “is just another thread in the weave.”



With a deep breath, Jonathan stepped toward the door. Nyx followed, her hourglass glowing faintly as they crossed the threshold. The void around them erupted into light, the echoes of their pasts fading into silence.



When the light receded, Jonathan stood on a platform overlooking the cosmos. In his hand, the orb had transformed into a single glowing thread, warm and vibrant. Above him, the stars rearranged themselves into a single word: Begin.



Nyx stood beside him, her hourglass now a faint glow in her hands. She smiled. “We’re not done, are we?”



Jonathan returned the smile, the weight of his past no longer holding him down. “No. We’re just getting started.”



In the Skylight Zone, endings are illusions, and beginnings are merely reflections of choices yet to be made. Tonight, Jonathan Gale discovered that even at the edge of existence, the journey continues, weaving threads of light into the infinite tapestry of possibility.



Only in The SkyLightZone.

Reccs for dog behaviorists helping with hyperarousal adolescent dogs?,AskSF,1i97yp5,2025-01-24 17:31:03,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/1i97yp5/reccs_for_dog_behaviorists_helping_with/,YAYtersalad,,"As title states, I have a teenage dog of a working breed that has always struggled with hyperarousal/overstimulation/over-excitement. 

We’ve done a number of group based classes (and have seen great progress) but she seems to be on the far end of the spectrum of difficulty in reaching a reliably neutral state of mind when out and about despite a lot of training time, slow pacing, a lot of distance exposure, and utilizing multiple tactics that seem to work for others (especially compared to previous dogs I’ve had prior)… so figure we could benefit from some more individualized work. She’s got a great drive to learn and work, and is working through foundational skills for some dog sports but just can’t quite get her comfortable enough to just do the normal city dog lifestyle, over-fixating on wanting to greet dogs or just in general often being so close to over threshold from standard delivery trucks, busses, and those stupid dodge chargers. 

I’m not entirely averse to behavior management but prefer to skew at least mostly positive reinforcement as the breed is prone to being highly sensitive to anything harsh. Thanks all! "
Tax Implications of Inheritance Abroad as a Swiss B Permit Holder,SwissPersonalFinance,1i97bo2,2025-01-24 17:03:20,2,0.75,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwissPersonalFinance/comments/1i97bo2/tax_implications_of_inheritance_abroad_as_a_swiss/,DeadlyPotatos,,"Hello everyone,

I’m looking for advice regarding my tax situation as a Swiss resident. Here’s my background:

I currently live in Vaud and hold a B permit.

I am a dual citizen of France and Senegal.

My annual salary in Switzerland is less than CHF 120,000, so I’m taxed at source.


Recently, my father passed away (prior to my B permit) and I inherited some assets in Senegal, shared with my siblings. My share of the inheritance includes:

1. A family house and multiple plots of land. (Around 80k fch)


2. Around fch 150,000 in a bank account.



I am trying to understand if I need to file a full tax return in Switzerland now or if I can stay on tax-at-source, given my income is under the CHF 120,000 threshold.

My Key Questions:

1. Do I need to declare the inheritance and assets abroad?

I understand Switzerland taxes worldwide wealth, but assets abroad (e.g., the house and land) might only affect my tax rate, not be directly taxed. Is that correct?



2. How should I handle the EUR 150,000 in the Senegalese bank account?

Do I need to declare it as part of my global wealth, even if it’s not in Switzerland?



3. What documents will I need to provide to the tax office?

For example, valuations of the house and land ? What kind of document is acceptable ?



4. Am I liable for Swiss inheritance tax?

From what I’ve read, Vaud doesn’t tax direct heirs (children), but I’d like confirmation. Also all the inheritance happened prior to my arrival in Switzerland.


I plan to contact the Vaud tax authorities, but I wanted to get some insights from this community first. Has anyone faced a similar situation? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help!"

Short sleepers rejoice,sleep,1i96p0h,2025-01-24 16:36:15,7,0.9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1i96p0h/short_sleepers_rejoice/,fanzee_p,,"After a decade of searching, the UC San Francisco scientists who identified the only human gene known to promote “natural short sleep” – lifelong, nightly sleep that lasts just four to six hours yet leaves individuals feeling fully rested – have discovered a second. 

Natural short sleepers remained a mystery until 2009, when a study conducted by Fu’s team discovered that people who had inherited a particular mutation in a gene called DEC2 averaged only 6.25 hours of sleep per night; study participants lacking the mutation averaged 8.06 hours.

Tesearchers have also uncovered a single-letter mutation in a gene known as ADRB1 that, like the mutation in DEC2, was associated with natural short sleep.

Natural  short sleepers actually seem to benefit from this quirk of their biology. Fu says researchers have found that short sleepers tend to be more optimistic, more energetic and better multitaskers. They also have a higher pain threshold, don’t suffer from jet lag and some researchers believe they may even live longer"
"Yes, this metro area has relatively affordable housing, and yes, there are quality public schools here - but can you really have both?",StLouis,1i96h2d,2025-01-24 16:26:43,2,0.58,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1i96h2d/yes_this_metro_area_has_relatively_affordable/,Ja_snake_,,"I ask this if nothing else out of curiosity as to what will happen in districts like Ritenour, Hazelwood, Hancock, Belleville, Collinsville in the next 10-15 years. Why these districts? They are pretty unambiguously affordable on two median incomes (44k individual 78k houshold- census) and are considered middling to bad (Hazelwood West is the highest “ranked” in the area at 49). (And yes, I’m are that better things generally cost more money, whether they should or not is beside the point. I’m talking about a baseline quality/affordability ratio)

I’m aware that some SLPS schools rank well, but we’re talking about maybe a thousand students max in a city of nearly 300,000 people. You can’t just buy a house in the city, have kids and count on everything falling into place the way you would take for granted in every other district here. And I am very pro-city and want SLPS to turn the corner, but I don’t think any reasonable person is buying in the city soon and expecting the schools to fall into place en masse in 5-10 years. 

A lot of the “value” districts like maplewood-rh, pattonville, mehlville are seeming to creep past the median income threshold. And I’m talking about first time buyers and single family houses, not because I think anyone is straight up entitled to one, but a pretty reasonable benchmark in my opinion. 50+ year old 2 bed and a yard “starter home.” Actually I think Affton fits this fairly well and I’ve seen it mentioned related to this topic on this sub, could be a good barometer the next few years

And not to be “won’t somebody think of the affluent and privileged,” but I graduated from Kirkwood ten years ago. My fiancée and I are basically at exactly the median household. We’d have to both triple our incomes to be able to buy there on top of down payment money. Now I don’t feel entitled to or even want to buy in Kirkwood or Des Peres but I think it’s worth noting how outrageously expensive it would be to someone who was in those schools ten years ago, even somebody doing way better than me. And yes at some point I will benefit from my parents equity in that house, but I do want them to, you know, stay alive for a while. And this isn’t just for young first time buyers to be like me, it’s for people who went to, say, pattonville or ritenour too

And my point with that is there has to be thousands of others in mid-late 20s in a similar position. We’ll just buy in Belleville or Collinsville or the city, and it’ll be tight but fine, just don’t want it to get worse. But I do wonder if others will just try to rent forever in the currently good districts, if the gap between affordable and not, good schools and not as good schools, will just continue to widen. Or if there will be some balancing out."
Growing Instability Observed in Konya Province Turkey & Sinkhole Proliferation after 2012,Disastro,1i95u9e,2025-01-24 15:59:08,21,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disastro/comments/1i95u9e/growing_instability_observed_in_konya_province/,ArmChairAnalyst86,,"There are certain subsidence hotspots around the world for a variety of factors which are not all the same from place to place. I often reference this part of Turkey but today we are going a bit deeper.

Today a few relevant stories broke. [The first is the collapse of a 4 story apartment building in Konya](https://apnews.com/article/turkey-building-collapse-people-trapped-c8ed35d0c0c4e2252dadaf52b77cf01e). The second is the [report of a 30 meter deep sinkhole forming in a poor farmers field](https://x.com/Xnews_with_grok/status/1882649336745693443).

[Building Collapse](https://reddit.com/link/1i95u9e/video/nah1wbypj0fe1/player)

[Sinkholes](https://reddit.com/link/1i95u9e/video/eyeayw4fvzee1/player)

The entire Konya plain is suffering from this phenomenon. Its largely blamed on groundwater use. To be sure, groundwater plays a key role. Human activity plays a role in groundwater. However, to prematurely attribute this exclusively to the domain of anthropogenic activity misses the larger pattern and factors in play. As a useful comparison, South Dakota is experiencing a very similar pattern in their subsidence with these massive holes forming in primarily agricultural areas. However, these sinkholes are moving closer and closer to residential areas. There was a lawsuit thrown out against mining companies in South Dakota because of state immunity but also because the gypsum is claimed to have been extracted from the surface and not underground. They claimed this would have happened anyway and the thousands of ancient sinkholes in the region attest to that.

Why would two regions separated by continents observe the same phenomenon accelerating at exactly the same point in time? The thing is, its much more than two regions. In each investigation, I have noted the years 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020 references widely. Additionally, there are many ancient sinkholes in the region. All over the world there are sinkhole hotspots like this from ancient times, and we cannot reliably attribute them to our activity. Yet, its only in recent decades that we have seen such a wild proliferation of them, along with proliferation of many other phenomena which I do not consider as unfortunate coincidence. Subsidence is taking off at alarming pace and the world is starting to notice. New Orleans and Florida are not suffering from drought or similar features, yet they are showing the same signs. Because of uniformity doctrine, our paradigm cannot even entertain the possibility that we are in fact seeing an acceleration in all geophysical processes and geological processes. Look at the African Rift. Right as Ethiopia entered into major volcanic crisis, a study came out saying that the timeline for the African rift separation has accelerated by millions of years off the initial estimate based on the previous measurements. Now its much much faster. They still say 500K years, but this assumes a constant rate of change, but their study is reporting the rate of change is accelerating. That is the key finding. Not the timeline.

It was recently discovered that the Konya Plain is experiencing something called ""lithospheric dripping"". Essentially while the ground is uplifting, isolated parts drip downward.

The map above identifies dripping hotspots detected thus far and I included the image for Konya.

You don't see any of these factors mentioned in public discourse on the topic. Its all about drought, groundwater use, irrigation, etc. You have to see past the policymaking. It serves no practical use to tell these people that there is no stopping this. Might as well focus on what we can affect, which includes groundwater use, but make no mistake. This is a geological process. Always has been and always will be. The earth is littered from features from previous episodes of instability. We are still in the latent phase of this episode, but clearly things are picking up. You may disagree with me on root origins and scope, but there is no denying the uptick and the consequences regardless.

Here was a key statement in the Turkey investigation.

*“The key conclusion of this work is that basin evolution and plateau uplift may be linked in a multistage process of lithospheric removal within a large-scale orogenic plateau system. Supported by geological, geophysical, and geodetic data,* ***our model results explain the enigmatic active subsidence*** *of the Konya Basin amidst the rising Central Anatolian plateau interior,” the researchers concluded.*

Here is more information and studies on this particular region. Subsidence occurs in many forms and through many processes, but it is undeniable that those processes have kicked into a much higher gear. Full disclosure, I used a chatgpt search to compile the results coherently and was quite impressed with the results.

Several studies have highlighted significant land subsidence issues in various regions during the years following 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020:

**Coachella Valley, California (2010–2017):** Research indicates that subsidence rates during 2010–2017 were generally less than half of those computed for 1995–2010, with reductions up to 75%. Notably, the northern part of the valley experienced uplift of up to 60 mm between 2014 and 2017.

**Mexico City, Mexico (2014–2017):** A study assessing land subsidence risk in Mexico City found that approximately 15.43% of the population resided in intermediate to very-high-risk zones between October 2014 and October 2017. The analysis indicated that around 12% of the urbanized area had exceeded an angular distortion threshold of 0.002 radians, above which structural damage is more likely.

**Houston, Texas (2014–2020):** Analyses of land subsidence rates in large coastal cities revealed that Houston experienced the fastest peak subsidence rates in the United States, averaging about 17 millimeters (0.67 inches) per year from 2014 to 2020.

**Iran (2014–2020):** A study analyzing satellite data from 2014 to 2020 found that 3.5% of Iran's land area is subsiding due to excessive groundwater extraction, primarily for irrigation. The most affected area is Kerman province, with subsidence rates exceeding 35 cm per year, impacting infrastructure such as airports, roads, and railways.

[Length of Day Variations Explained in a Bayesian Framework](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148)

*In Figure* [*1*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-fig-0001) *we show the LOD observations as well as their secular trend, the reconstructed climatic effects (barystatic), and the residuals after removing them, which will be compared to the reconstructed LOD from geomagnetic observations.* ***The climatic effects prior to the onset of climate change in the industrial era feature various long-period fluctuations (multidecadal to millennial), with maximum amplitudes of about 0.4 ms. These effects are not only anti-correlated with fluctuations observed in LOD (Pearson correlation of ∼−0.55) but they are also smaller by a factor of ∼10 than the fluctuations observed in the LOD record that have an amplitude of around 4 ms (Figure*** [***1c***](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-fig-0001)***). Although the uncertainties in these reconstructions remain large, it is unlikely that the climatic effects can be considered the cause of the observed fluctuations. This shows that some other processes must be contributing to these large fluctuations. It has long been known that core processes are the most likely candidate for explaining these fluctuations (Munk & MacDonald,*** [***1960***](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-bib-0040)***), which our results also imply***\*\*.\*\*

It looks like they went right to the ""core"" of the issue. Their data suggests climate related, or barystatic changes are minor. Regardless of where they came from, from us or the natural variation in climate. They used an inner earth model with magnetohydrodynamics incorporated because the electrical properties are key. They are saying that the earths core is responsible for the length of day glitches which stem from effects on earths rotation, which was blamed on human groundwater use in the NASA funded study.

I didn't see any major news outlets report this study though. Why would they? Wouldn't want to confuse the public or anything....

Again, in every scenario, here is what you must do to truly understand what is happening to our planet. When you see a phenomena, go find when it happened before, usually in the geological record. Investigate the cause given. Learn the geophysical factors they don't like to talk about anymore in favor of an anthropogenic dominated paradigm. Then, go look in the real world and see if you can find evidence of those factors at work. Then, with that understanding in mind, apply anthropogenic activity secondarily. These processes happen with or without us. We are contributing and doing so significantly, but there needs to be balance. I am tired of the media and mainstream science giving you a multiple choice question with only one answer. I am here to provide that balance. It hasn't made me many friends, but if you have been riding with me these past few months, you must see it too...

Great changes are materializing. Slowly and gradually, but this is the latent phase and that is expected. The transformation of the planet is a process, not an event. Creation is inherently a destructive process. The two are inextricably linked together. People are watching their neighborhoods burn, fall into the ground, washed into the sea, blown to bits, and great upheaval on our planet beginning to take form and they are angry about it. They see it as all man's doing because that is what they are told over and over and over without any balance. If you are expecting mainstream science to be objective, you can stop. They wont be. They cant be. I prefer accuracy over agenda, no matter how well meaning. My social responsibility lies with figuring out what the hell is going on. 

The fact is there are many researchers and scientists out there looking into the geophysical forcing and they write papers just the same, but who gets to decide what papers run in the media outlets? Who gets to decide which  ones you see and don't see? Most people are not going to comb the literature themselves. They just want to be told what is happening. They don't understand anything about the geological record and the riddles of earths past that the uniformity doctrine has never been able to explain. They don't understand that even in the Holocene, there has been significant upheaval. The reason why is because science and policy can no longer be separated. The IPCC makes the rules and they have been clear about the lengths they will go to in order to control the narrative because if they don't, you will see what you are not supposed to see too early.

As long as it can be pinned on humans in total, people will believe it can be fixed, or at least could have been. It keeps the party going while the band plays on like the Titanic. Don't get me wrong. We affect our environment profoundly. We should do everything that we can to get our house in order. We wont... but we should. We should mitigate and improve everything we can but we also must be objective and see past the strategy coming down from the top. The earth, sun, and galaxy do not give a damn for our words on pages. We have placed essentially arbitrary limits on what they are capable of and in what time frame but it was never up to us."
"An Otherworldly Scholar [LitRPG, Isekai] - Chapter 189",HFY,1i95i5b,2025-01-24 15:44:30,233,0.99,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i95i5b/an_otherworldly_scholar_litrpg_isekai_chapter_189/,ralo_ramone,OC,"I stood before the Ebros soldiers. The golden armor of Prince Adrien’s elite troops gleamed under the spring sun. By their side stood the Farcrest Guardsmen wearing tunics with the colors of the Marquis—red and black—above their chainmail. Behind the soldiers, the nobles exchanged confused glances. I was supposed to be dead.

Janus paled as the Marquis whispered something to his ear.

“Robert Clarke, you are under arrest for the murder of Izabeka Kiln!” Janus shouted. The man wasn’t wearing his simple black and grey fencing uniform but the gilded red armor of the Captain of the Guard. “Guards, detain him!”

So that was the lie he had used to cover for Captain Kiln’s sudden disappearance. That explained why he and a detachment of guardsmen had chased me into the Farlands. The whole city believed I was responsible, and I had fled the crime scene.

The guardsmen pointed their halberds forward and closed into me. They were veterans. I used \[Identify\]. Every single one of them had Advanced Classes, around level thirty-five. It was a good sign. The veteran guardsmen were loyal to Captain Kiln.

Prince Adrien remained still behind his men, waiting for the scene to unfold.

I grinned. The stage was perfect.

Captain Kiln emerged from the orc ranks.

“Weapons down, maggots! I don’t remember ordering anyone to detain this man,” she barked, her messy gray hair fluttering in the wind. Despite her ragged clothes, her dignified presence left little doubt of her true identity.

The guardsmen froze, their halberds dropped, and their faces looked like they had seen a ghost. One of them even started sobbing. Even Prince Adrien seemed confused; however, we couldn’t allow a royal inquiry.

“Janus the Weasel, I have come to return the favor. Only blood will resolve this matter!” Captain Kiln’s cloak slipped over her shoulder, revealing her wounded arm. “As it is my right as Farcrest’s Thane, I challenge you to a duel.”

A murmur ran through the troops. Prince Adrien's bodyguards closed their ranks between them and the Farcrest nobles as every pair of eyes fell upon Janus. He was struck, shrunken like a nocturnal vermin under the sun. The truth was poison for liars.

I exchanged glances with the Marquis, and a flash of recognition passed before his eyes. The winner would determine who knew about his betrayal. If Janus won, everything would remain the same, but if we won, we would have the Marquis by the leash. Either of the two was better than losing everything, and the Marquis seemed to realize that.

“I allow the duel,” the Marquis' voice rose above the murmur of the guardsmen. 

Prince Adrien glanced at me, trying to piece the puzzle together. In response, I offered a polite bow. The less he knew, the better for Farcrest and the orphanage. 

The Teal Moon warriors, royal soldiers, and Farcrest guards stepped back and formed a wide circle. The murmurs grew louder. \[Foresight\] caught snippets of conversation. *Did Janus try to kill the Captain? Shouldn’t the Marquis incarcerate Janus? Why are they dueling?*

The support of the guards leaned towards Captain Kiln. Janus was a legend, the only commoner who rose to become an Imperial Knight, but Captain Kiln had bled shoulder to shoulder with the guardsmen.

“Robert Clarke will be my champion,” Captain Kiln announced.

The guardsmen parted ways, and Janus walked into the circle.

“How does it feel, Janus, to have everybody see you for what you truly are?” I asked. “Everyone here knows you're not who you pretend to be. Even as we speak, rumors are spreading throughout the city. They'll question whether you truly attempted to kill their beloved Captain, and they’ll see her arm. Where are you going to run away then?”

Janus remained silent, but no matter how much he pushed his acting skills, my \[Foresight\] could see through his facade. He was hesitant.

Abei entered the circle, followed by a middle-aged man dressed in a green robe with the royal crest on the chest. Only a month had passed since the last time I’d seen the Scholar, yet he seemed older than I remembered. 

“I will serve as the witness for the duel in Tauron’s place,” Abei announced. “Judicial duels don’t usually have restrictions unless both parties agree. Would you like to set any conditions? Incapacitation clause, maybe? Rendition?”

I shook my head. Only one of us would leave the duel arena alive.

Abei sighed in defeat, like he was seeing his sons fight each other.

“A proper duel it is,” he said with a serious expression. “Please, get ready.”

I cast off my jacket, secured the straps of my black leather armor, and adjusted my leather gloves. I checked my pockets. Everything was in place: the enchanted pebbles, the Holone Grapes, the Leechflame Dagger, and a backup orc dagger strapped to my boot. I doubted myself for a second. The shotgun and the enchanted rifles might be useful, but the combat area was barely ten meters in diameter, and Janus could cross that distance with a single teleport. Stopping to aim would be a liability, and he could tank it using a skill. It was better to stick to the plan. 

A blue barrier covered the circular area as I prepared myself, and the man in the green robe guided Abei outside the arena. I walked six steps toward the mountains while Janus did the same toward Farcrest. On the other side of the barrier, the kids clung together like ducklings without a duck mom. I turned and focused on Janus.

The barrier was sealed shut. Nothing would escape until one of us was dead.

The sounds from outside the barrier came in distorted.

“You can run away whenever you like, Janus, but I can’t say the nobles will be happy with a murderer who can pass through Fortifier barriers,” I said with a grin.

Janus was still at a loss for words, his brain trying to make sense of the repercussions of our sudden appearance. Our plan was working. Trapping a Void Jumper was impossible, yet we had engineered the situation to keep him in place.

Janus finally opened his mouth.

“This doesn’t change anything. Whether the city hates me is irrelevant. Tauron needs me, and the rest will fold when they realize I’m a Prestige Class, ” Janus said, blinking rapidly like he had just snapped from a bad dream. 

He drew his sword. It was different from the cheap iron sword he used to carry.

**Mastercraft Orichalcum Sword. Enchantment threshold: 3000.**

“When I kill you, they’ll forget all about you, and that little orphanage will be nothing but a memory yet again.” 

“If,” I said.

Janus grinned, entertained.

“You are dangerous, Robert Clarke, but inside this barrier, you don’t have the protection of Prince Adrien. You forfeited your greatest advantage, and the chance of talking your way out has passed,” he said, testing his blade with his thumb. “I recognize your \[Mana Manipulation\] is strong, but in the end, you are still a weak and squishy Scholar.” 

I drew my sword.

Neither of us saluted.

“May the best fighter win. Fight!” Abei shouted from outside the barrier, his voice amplified by a spell.

Janus disappeared, leaving behind a screen of dark mana particles. The crowd gasped. He closed the ten meters between us in the blink of an eye and thrust his sword towards my chest. \[Foresight\] showed me the projection of the movement. I parried and countered with a precise diagonal swing, but Janus easily dismantled my attack. 

Movement skills like \[Quick Step\] increased movement speed for a short duration. However, Janus’ blink allowed him to move almost instantly. The crowd noticed the difference.

“Do you hear them, Caretaker?” Janus said. “They know I’m better than them. That's all that counts when monsters appear.”

We exchanged quick blows. My mana barrier blocked any hit my sword wasn’t fast enough to catch. Janus moved back and forth like the tides, always ahead of my movements but unable to land a killing blow. He was reading me just like \[Foresight\] read his movements.

Janus accelerated the pace, but I kept up. I had to slow him down before he unleashed his real speed. Using \[Mirage\], I created two perfect copies of myself in an attempt to obfuscate his detection skills. Janus stepped back, sensing something was wrong. The illusion was perfect in every sense. 

The three blades crackled with bluish mana.

Sensing the danger, Janus disappeared.

I opened the floodgates, and \[Foresight\] drank mana like a man lost in the desert. A shiver ran down my spine as a chunk of mana was torn from my mana pool. Time slowed down to a crawl. The black mana particles froze mid-air. Then, with the corner of my eye, I saw a tear in reality slightly above my head. Janus emerged from the portal, his sword over his head, ready to kill me in a single strike.

My brain burned. I couldn’t enter slow-mode every time he blinked—the strain was huge—but I had a plan. Half of the pebbles inside my pouch shot out just as I wrote the first runes. Janus cut the first, but several others stuck to his armor and cape. Then, the enchantment circuit closed, binding the pebbles to the armor and cape. They shone with a weak light.

The world sped up again. Janus attacked faster than I could react; his blade gleamed with dark mana. My mana barrier shattered, and I felt the prick on my chest, barely piercing my skin. The Ghoul armor protected my vital organs. I kicked the ground before he could chain a second attack, and a forest of stone spikes emerged around me. Janus jumped back, and I pushed the attack. We exchanged blows, more and more stone spikes emerging from the ground as I advanced.

Janus blocked my sword with ease and dodged most of the stone spikes. The ones that managed to hit didn’t hurt him, though his armor was dented and battered in several spots. 

Janus tore off his left shoulder pad, confused. Then, he disappeared. For an instant, I lost the mana signature of the enchanted pebbles, but at the next moment, they reappeared behind me. Janus was sneaky, almost invisible to my mana sense, but the pebbles shone like lighthouses. \[Swordsmanship\] and \[Foresight\] moved my body, but Janus was faster than me. I managed to block a killing blow, but he still grazed my left arm. 

I used my Wind-Shot Boots to thrust at full speed. The \[Mirage\]s moved with me. Janus hesitated for a split second. My sword hit his naked shoulder, but it felt like I had just hit a concrete wall. My sword, even with the mana coating, bounced. My defense was wide open. Janus grinned, his eyes full of malice. In a panic, I used \[Aerokinesis\]. My body spun mid-air, just like I’d seen Firana doing, and I buried my boot in his side. It also felt like kicking a concrete wall.

Captain Kiln was right; high-level warriors were extremely durable.

Janus stumbled back. 

The combat extended for minutes and minutes to no end. I shot Mana Draining Pebbles, but after the first few hits, Janus learned to destroy them. My Ghoul armor was turned into a pincushion. Janus was agile like Firana, but his arm carried the force of a dragon. He blinked around me, unleashing a flurry of attacks against my mana shield. \[Foresight\] drained my mana pool as I countered his attacks. Soon, my body was covered in minor cuts, but I felt no pain. Anything outside the Fortifier’s barrier disappeared from my conscience. All that existed in my world was Janus and me.

I needed to slow him down, but I had run out of Mana Draining Pebbles. 

Combining \[Geokinesis\] and \[Hydrokinesis\], I turned the ground into a deep and soft mud. I remained afloat thanks to the stone pillars under my foot. Janus sunk to his knees, the weight of his armor pulling him down. 

Janus grinned, and mana swirled around his feet. Then, he pulled himself and stood atop the mud pool like solid ground.

“I can walk on walls, Caretaker. You will need something better than cheap tricks,” he mockingly said as he disappeared into a curtain of black mana particles.

My mana barrier was draining energy at a worrying pace. Each one of Janus’ blows was the equivalent of the charge of a dozen Ghouls. His teleportation skill, however, required a lot of mana. I examined his face. Black circles had appeared under his eyes. 

My mana pool was still my biggest advantage.

“Running out of juice, Janus?” I gasped for air, pulling strings from the Fountain and slowly replenishing my mana pool. “You shouldn’t have put me in the same forest as a Monster Surge Boss. You fumbled it, Janus, and now everybody sees you as what you truly are. The lies are over.”

Suddenly, blackness surrounded me like someone had turned off the sun. The only light source was the Bind-Light pebbles stuck to Janus’ armor.

“What are these things?” he grunted, trying to tear them off. The Bind rune kept the pebble stuck to the metal. “I guess it doesn’t matter. Where we’re going, these will be useless.”

A burst of mana erupted from Janus’ body. I raised my mana shield. Captain Kiln wasn’t the only one with a secret technique that put a lot of strain on the body. 

“Do you know the secret to killing high-level combatants?” Janus clenched his jaw in pain. “You don’t let them use their skills.”

The ground parted, and we fell to a place without sky. I landed in a shallow pool that extended as far as the eye could see. The water was freezing cold. Fragments of the world fell with us: pieces of armor, my cloak, and a bunch of dirt that clouded the water. The water barely reached my ankle. Under the water, there was perfectly leveled solid stone. Here and there were vestiges of old ruins. The place reminded me of my mana pool, a flooded underground cave, but we weren’t floating in nothingness. In the sky, there was a single faint white star.

I clutched my sword and used \[Hydrokinesis\] to cast Janus into an ice prison, but the skill didn’t obey. The water remained undisturbed. 

“Surprised?” Janus grinned, noticing my failed attempt.

The Bind-Light stones had slipped from his armor. 

My Wind-Shot Boots were offline.

There wasn’t a single speck of environmental mana. 

I pulled mana from the Fountain, but the power felt weak and distant. I looked up into the sky. A sense of intense dread got a hold on me—the sole white star in the infinite void couldn’t be the Fountain, right?

“Where are we?” I asked, holding back the urge to cast a weak fireball. I had to keep it a secret until the last moment.

Janus opened his arms.

“I don’t know. Nowhere? No matter how far you go, this place remains the same. Hard stone, fresh water, and ruins too old to make any sense of them, but what is inside this place is irrelevant. What is important is that you can’t use your skills here,” Janus said meditatively. “Say, Caretaker, do you think you are a better fencer than me without your \[Swordsmanship\]?”

Without a warning, Janus lunged. Our swords clashed. My blade was pushed to the side. Even without the System, Janus was stronger than me. Following the flow of the movement, Janus moved his sword in an arch as he tried to bypass my blade and hit my face. I didn’t see the attack coming. I grabbed Janus’ sword with my hand, and the blade bit through my leather gloves. Pain exploded in my brain. I tried to stab him, but my blade was tangled with his.

The fight became chaotic. We struggled for control of the position, locked in an awkward grapple. Without the System, there was no more “fantasy swordsmanship”; there was just the struggle for survival. Janus was taller than me, and he was built like a bear. Janus’ blade slashed my hand as it slipped from my grasp.

In a desperate attempt, I let my sword go and channeled the little Fountain mana I could grasp. I grabbed Janus’ forearm and transferred heat into the metal. Janus howled. He let go of his sword and pushed me away then fought to untie the knots of his bracers. The swords got lost in the muddy water. 

I charged shoulder-first into Janus’ stomach. We both fell. Disoriented, I reached for my boot and pulled out the orc dagger. I tried to channel more Fountain mana, but there was nothing to draw from. Janus was already on his feet, dagger in hand. His forearm boiled with blisters.

We got closer. I swung at Janus’ stomach, but he stopped my arm with the palm of his hand. He swung at my eyes, but I leaned back, letting the knife cut through the air. Janus put too much force in the blow, and he slipped. I seized the opening and aimed at his neck. Janus raised his hand to block, and my knife ended up embedded in his shoulder.

I clenched my teeth. It wasn’t a killing blow.

Janus grinned as his blade pierced my skin and muscle.

I stumbled back, and I lost hold of my knife. Janus approached me, a malicious smile on his face. I tried to push him back, but my arms felt as heavy as cinder blocks. I fell to my knees. Then I saw the blood coming out in torrents. I clutched my stomach, trying to make sense of the scene. It wasn't possible. Blood was supposed to remain inside. I searched for a Holone Grape, but Janus cut my belt and threw away my knife and the pouches.

“Don’t rush…” Janus grunted. “I’m going to enjoy watching you die.”

Blood came through my fingers. My vision was beginning to blur.

Then, we were back in Farcrest. The sun was blue, and the spring breeze caressed my face. \[Foresight\] came back online. Alarms went off in my brain—a timer. I was dying. Cauterize. I couldn’t focus. \[Pyrokinesis\] didn’t respond. \[Foresight\] gorged on my mana, and time slowed. Every single cell in my body was fighting to live; my heart rate slowed, my capillary vessels contracted, and hundreds of other survival mechanisms were triggered. The System wanted me to survive at all costs, but it only delayed the inevitable.

Janus fell on his knee, his shoulders shaking due to Mana Exhaustion.

I only needed a minute.

My backpack was still there. I crawled and grabbed Byrne’s shotgun. The chamber was empty. I had used the last of Ginz’s shells on the Lich. Then, \[Foresight\] threw one last idea into my conscious mind. I searched my pocket and pulled out a bright red shell—the shell I had been saving for Holst. I felt the plastic under my skin and put it inside the chamber.

Janus recognized the threat, and his eyes shot wide open. He tried to blink, but he was out of mana. I didn’t trust my aim.

I used \[Stun Gaze\]. 

Despite any level differences, he didn’t have the mana to resist. The skill grasped him harder than his incipient mana exhaustion. Janus turned into a statue. 

I pulled the trigger. The bang deafened me.

The rain of lead hit Janus at four hundred meters per second. He remained still, like an old oak. Then, blood poured through the holes in his armor, mouth, and nose. Without uttering a single sound, Janus fell flat on his face.

The orphanage was finally free.

Leaving Trading212 + Review,trading212,1i9595r,2025-01-24 15:33:59,1,0.53,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1i9595r/leaving_trading212_review/,BornAliveDead,💡Idea,"It’s a more lengthy write up and not everyone will be interested, apologies in advance! But it might be useful for those who want a review of the platform and those who plan to make higher frequency trades!

After multiple trading restrictions and then an indefinite one, I have decided not to continue having debates with customer support but to move to another broker. 

To start with the positives, I actually really like Trading212. The interface is really appealing and simple to use, this is perhaps the standout benefit compared to other UK offering brokers. 
The daily interest on cash is really useful and the rates are super competitive compared to other providers, so this is also wonderful. Really what is extra great about Trading212 is that despite criticisms, especially in the past, it is undeniable that the platform is innovating and improving at a good pace the last few years! So overall, I was delighted with it, and felt comfortable enough putting £200k +, mostly deposited in dollars for trading US stocks (another great convenience). 

However, now for the reasons why I am leaving. 
I was imposed with trading bans and restrictions, resulting in an indefinite version, which I will no longer be trying to resolve, it seems a hassle and there seems no guarantee of any permanent solutions. 

First of all, these obviously limited my ability to buy shares for trading, meaning I lost some opportunities I had found setups for, (especially unlucky with timing I must say), and I was unable to average down at some key points. These bans would also come at unpredictable times with no prior warning, meaning you had no time to adjust beforehand. This resulted in additional stress and worrying.
Apparently my trading activities and volume posed financial risk and I was asked to review my activity. My financial information was fully updated, with a high amount of liquid wealth, and I said I was happy to take losses and significant drawdowns. I was also profitable. 
I do admit my trading volume was very likely higher than most other users. 

However, saying I was being too risky seems disingenuous, as I was in profit from capital gains and interest paid, and because they happily allow their users to gamble and take huge losses on penny stocks. But alright, some argue that it is due to the UK government regulations and mandates and Trading212 has no autonomy otherwise, which I don’t think is fully the case, they must have significant discretion when it comes to these types of situations. Even then, the trading bans and asking to review one’s activity had no objective requirements, they were very vague saying “too many trades/high volume”. How is one supposed to know the thresholds? There was no further clarification.

Support does reply but seemingly did not react to the points and questions I raised, such as clarifications as to what the exact issue is, how long it could take to resolve them, what are the thresholds before receiving a ban. They would simply repeat information already received, ask for countless supporting documents. Perhaps it is their protocol, fair enough, but at least some answers such as how long the process might take would have been helpful, as it impacts my investment decisions.
As a result, I am moving my whole Trading212 portfolio to Interactive Brokers. I have been using them for a while and they are indeed more advanced and professional, larger in size as a broker as well, though they are initially more complex and difficult to navigate than Trading212. 
Most of you will likely not encounter the issue of getting restrictions, especially if you are not trading frequently, so not to worry! As I said, I think it is a great platform overall for basic stock trading and investing, apart from this issue. But if you do start getting restrictions, be weary and consider saving yourself some time and effort by at least having other broker options available!

---

The rest of the brunch is quite pleasant. As much as that is possible with her sister and her mother chatting together about topics Ella doesn’t know anything about. They go so far as including Damian - because he does - but at least he tries to drag Ella into the conversation every so often. Valerie notices it after the second time he does it, and makes an effort to include Ella after that. Their mother stays blissfully ignorant and keeps trying to steer the conversation back to that one cousin Ella hasn’t seen in ten years. 

Plus, Paul is right there, staring at Ella. At least, he stares at Ella until he glances at Damian, and then he pointedly looks away. But he always returns to staring at Ella. It’s making her extremely uncomfortable. Paul has no problems being included in her mother’s conversation - he has actually seen that cousin recently. How messed up is that? Someone from outside the family has seen Ella’s distant relatives more often than Ella has.

The moment Ella can escape the brunch without being rude, she does. Damian walks her to their room, and glances about the room without a care. He’s used to this kind of richesse. Most of his attention goes to Ella’s bare legs, which he isn’t used to seeing so out in the open. Ella zeroes in on the couch that looks too soft to be real, and lets herself fall backwards onto it. She groans. It’s softer than she imagined. She feels like she’s sinking into a warm hug, except it’s a piece of furniture large enough to fit Damian next to her. She wants to steal it and take it home. It’s a distant fantasy. The couch wouldn’t even fit in her living room.

Damian remains near the door, leaning against the wall. Even when Ella lifts her legs to the armrest to rest her feet - stupid heels. Her skirt slides up almost all the way to her hips, and in any other situation, Ella would be mortified. Right here, right now, with Damian standing there staring at her? It’s exhilarating. 

A few moments later of nothing happening - no sound, no movement, no comment - Ella gets up onto her elbows with a frown. She was certain that would entice him. She was low key hoping for it. She wanted to continue their ‘game’ from this morning. 

Well, Damian is enticed. His arms are crossed, his fingers digging creases into the tight fabric of his shirt. He’s staring at Ella with scorching eyes. He’s a statue of barely contained want.

And Ella wants to break his control.

Ella stares at him while slowly toeing off her heels. The movement shifts her skirt a bit more, flashing her panties at him. Damian swallows heavily, before shaking his head and looking away. It looks like that physically hurts. Ella grins. “I need to go have that chat with Paul.”

Well, that certainly ruins the mood. Her grin falters. Ella pulls her skirt down and sits up with a huff. “Do you have to do that now?” 

He nods. “I’d love to spend the rest of the weekend in our room with you, but I need to take care of business right now.” A look of disgust scrunches his nose. “Paul is not the type of man to take intimidation lying down. “ He gives Ella a serious look. “I've seen the way he looks at you. In his eyes, you owe him something. I have to make sure he understands you’re off limits before he psyches himself up to something. Or he’ll be coming for you.”

Ella sinks back into the couch with a frown. That makes Paul sound like a dangerous guy. He’s not dangerous, he’s just a bit of an annoying jerk. That makes him an asshole of the garden variety, not the run-for-your-life type. Sure, he makes Ella uncomfortable, and he seems to expect more from their relationship than is really there, but that’s par for the course for guys, isn’t it? Arthur is just as bad. Even Ella’s boss expects more from her in a professional capacity than he really should. 

Damian sighs and leaves the door to join Ella on the couch. He runs his fingers along the loose lock of hair brushing her cheek and cups her face. “Don’t worry or feel guilty. Whatever Paul does or says is on him. It’s not on you. You are amazing and beautiful. And I’d much rather be here fucking you into this couch without taking your dress off than dealing with that prick.” He pulls her in for a short, hard kiss. “You are so much better than anything else I can do in this place.” 

Ella’s face heats up, and Damian smirks. After another quick peck on her lips he promises to be back soon, and takes off. It’s only when he’s physically out of the room that Ella’s brain starts working again, and she hides her face in her hands. Damian’s words have no right to be as hot as they were. They made Ella forget about everything but Damian’s voice. She could imagine him taking her right here on this couch, uncaring about the fact that she wouldn’t be able to form a coherent thought. 

Ella’s fingers ghost over her throat, right where - just this morning - Damian’s hand had threatened to take her breath away. He wanted it just as much as Ella did. But he’s too mature to give in when he has responsibilities to take care of. He’s so dependable. If Ella wasn’t so frustrated right now, she’d realise just how much she’s falling in love with this guy.

As it is, Ella is focused on trying to calm her racing heart as she lays on the couch for a few minutes. It’s pretty hard to do when she can still feel Damian pressing up against her. She needs to get off this couch. But where-

The bed. The giant, downy bed covered in silk sheets. That’s going to be even more comfortable than the couch. And Ella is certainly not imagining laying there half asleep where Damian can find her and be tempted to do even more fun things with her.

Ella throws herself on the giant bed without another thought, burying herself in the soft sheets. For half an hour, Ella can lay there in blissful silence, teetering on the edge of consciousness. But then her rest gets interrupted by the loud movements of Damian entering the rooms again. 

There’s nothing attractive about the loud, brusk pacing. Or the way he drops his keys on the glass side table with a loud clatter. Ella scrambles out of the bed, but stops in the doorway. Damian’s stalking across the room, glaring at the ground. His aggravation is a tangible thing. Ella clutches at the door jamb, her heart racing in an entirely different manner than earlier, and the small noise draws Damian’s attention. The glare he was pointing at the floor turns on Ella.

Ella doesn’t gasp. She breathes in sharply through her nose and tenses up. It barely makes a sound. She doesn’t even blink.

It kicks Damian out of his funk. He physically pulls back, the frown dissipating instantly. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. “Sorry.” He rubs the space between his eyebrows heavily. “Paul’s a slippery fellow. The arse is hiding from me.”

Ella huffs out a laugh. Not that he's being particularly funny right now, but the sudden release of tension makes Ella chuckle without conscious thought. It feels vindicating for someone to see Paul for the annoyance he really is for once. Damian is the first person to see it - or at least, to tell Ella about it. Damian answers her laugh with a smile of his own. 
He’s not continuing his tirade, so Ella prompts him to break the silence. “What are you going to do now?”

“Find a different method of getting ‘your ex’ alone.” He even makes silly air quotes as he sits down on the sofa. He invites Ella to sit next to him. 

Ella groans, and starts walking towards Damian. “I got so mad when he called himself my ex. He definitely doesn’t qualify.”

“Do you have guys that qualify for the title?”

“Only one. Stefan. We split when he went to university on the other side of the country, and I moved to New York. Last I heard he was doing a doctorate in neuroscience or something.” Ella shrugs. She hasn’t thought of Stefan in years.  “You?”

The silence lasts longer than normal. Almost long enough for Ella to start thinking of a new topic. “There’s only Amber, for me. We were engaged.” Damian’s voice is strangely level.

“What happened?”

“She - died.” That was a telling pause. 

“Sorry for your loss.” Ella squeezes his knee, and Damian grasps her hand with a smile. Ella starts thinking about what she knows of Damian’s ex. He hasn’t really said anything about her. The only thing she really knows about Amber is that she’s a sore spot for Damian. And that she broke his heart, if his uncle is to be believed. Ella’s heart stutters. No - did Damian’s uncle kill her? She starts talking without thinking. “Was it family stuff?”

This time, Damian answers immediately. “No! No, It was -” Damian stops himself, his mouth opening without words coming out, until he shakes his head. “I don’t like to talk about it.” Damian’s lips are thin and he refuses to look at Ella. 

She hasn’t seen this raw emotional side of Damian before. She has no idea how to comfort him. How do you make someone feel better about their dead fiance that might have broken their heart before they died? 

You start talking about something else, obviously. “Any ideas on how to find Paul?”

Damian's head jerks up, and he blinks at Ella. His lips twitch up into a barely there smile. He glances down at their entwined hands before smirking and letting go of her hand. He slides his hand over her knee, up towards the edge of her skirt. “We could go for a walk? Show off your legs some more, maybe that’ll lure the coward out of hiding.” Ella scrunches her nose in disgust. Walking around through nature? In a skirt? Wearing heels? No, thank you. Damian’s smirk turns more sly. “Or we could keep ourselves busy here until dinner.” He leans in, his hand creeping up under her skirt.

Heat pools in her stomach, but Ella has to stop him. “We can’t. Lucy asked me to stop by to check out the bridesmaids’ dresses. I promised.” Damian starts pulling back, but Ella grabs his wrist. “But I only have to be there in half an hour, so, you know, we could make it quick.”

Damian grins and pulls Ella close to crush her lips with his. He doesn’t break the hard kiss as he talks in a low voice. “Ella, Love, nothing I want to do to you is ever quick.” His fingers ghost over her panties - they’re already soaked - but he doesn’t put any pressure in the touch. “We’ll have to wait for tonight.” He starts pulling back, but freezes when Ella pouts up at him.

“Let’s make it an early night then.”

Damian stares at Ella, mouth open and slowly turning into a sly grin. “You have such great ideas, love.” 

It takes them twenty more minutes to leave the room between more kisses and Ella trying to fix her lipstick. Eventually Damian calls in Maria and leaves for the golf course. Maria grins at Ella, but makes no comment at her mussed hair and make up. Not that Ella gives a flying rat’s ass. She’s floating on clouds all the way to Lucy’s room, and then gets smacked in the face with reality when she enters the room. 

The atmosphere is tense and filled with disapproval. It’s a feeling Ella has intimate experience with, so she notices it the second she crosses the threshold. The bridesmaids are spread out along the edges of the rooms, except for the one woman trying on a beautiful dress. Lucy is flitting around the woman with a kind smile, telling the seamstress how to fix the dress. Ella has no idea what Lucy’s is commenting on because the dress looks absolutely perfect on the model. 

The worst of the tension is radiating from the older woman standing a few feet away from Lucy, arms crossed and lips pinched. The way she stares at Lucy is the same way Ella’s mother tends to look at Ella. Except this isn’t Lucy’s mother - it’s her mother-in-law. Ella doesn’t know if that makes it better or worse.

Ella’s entrance breaks the strained mood. Every head in the room turns towards her in a flash. Ella freezes for a moment, but then throws a wave and says hello. The mother in law sniffs loudly and leaves the room without a word. Ella’s stomach sinks. Did she do something wrong?

The door slams behind the woman, and Ella flinches. Lucy sighs loudly, and comes over to hug Ella. “Thank God you are here. Keeping up the nice face is so difficult when Harry’s mother is around pulling her nose up at everything. Did you know she suggested Herrera for my bridal gown?” The way she says Herrera makes it sound like a bad thing, but Ella has no idea who that is. It must show on her face, because Lucy chuckles and rolls her eyes. 

“She’s a designer. Nice dresses, very lovely.” She motions at the dresses meant for the bridesmaids. “I bought her for my entourage, just not for me. But That Woman has decided Herrera is suddenly too tacky for her only son’s wedding. She believes I should have bought a Mirkwood for everyone, not just for myself.” 

Ella’s head snaps up. “Mirkwood? Damian’s called Mirkwood. I think his mother is a designer.” 

Everyone who was pretending not to listen to their conversation stops what they are doing. Lucy puts a soft hand on Ella’s arm. “Are you telling me you brought the son of Navida Mirkwood to my wedding?” Ella shrugs. She’s not sure what Damian’s mother’s name is. Damian did say his mother designed clothes, and she’s filthy rich. How many elite designers with the same last name can there be? 

Several of the bridesmaids squeal, and Lucy is ecstatic. Several of the women start gushing about certain Mirkwood outfits they have worn - or wished they had worn, as is more often the case - and how such-and-such pulled that one dress off. Lucy is completely pulled into the fangirling, her genuine smile lighting up the room again. 

It’s totally worth being pushed to the edge of the group, just to see the cloud gone from Lucy’s face. If only making everyone happy was as easy as name-dropping your boyfriend’s mom. Fake boyfriend? They’re real now, though… right?"
Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A New Approach,scoliosis,1i945yd,2025-01-24 14:47:15,0,0.27,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scoliosis/comments/1i945yd/adolescent_idiopathic_scoliosis_a_new_approach/,Such_Thing7698,Discussion,"This is my PERSONAL collection of information (my specific PERSONAL story) and the stories of many others.

Specifically, here I present my story.
My father has scoliosis, and so do I. If you ask my father, he will insist that I had a wonderful childhood (my sister seems to have not had one, or it was very mild).At my last X-ray (June 2023), I had a 47-degree scoliosis and a lot of pain.

In my opinion, the genetic component of idiopathic scoliosis is sensitivity—some people are more sensitive. Now, moving forward—see, the greatest injury that a parent doesn’t heal is passed down to the child. (In my case, repressed anger.) It can also come from grandparents. If our ancestors did not heal the injury, it is passed on to the next generations. These are all manifestations of untreated trauma from previous generations. A major event that happened in the past but was not recognized. Therefore, the next generations carry it. This way, they can recognize it.
I suffered from pain for a long time, but now I have no pain. It was unresolved trauma in my body.
The idea that scoliosis arises from asymmetric muscle tension was first suggested by Nicholas Andry in the 18th century, who coined the term ""Orthopaedics"" from the words ""straight"" (orthos) and ""child"" (pais) (LeVay, 1990). Andry promoted the theory of ""spasmodic muscle contraction"" as the cause of spinal deformity.
The Origin of Muscle Tension What Andry did not explain, however, was the cause of asymmetric muscle tension and how it deformed the spine. There are many potential causes of asymmetric muscle tension, including injury, sports, overuse of one side of the body, neurological disorders, congenital defects, issues with a particular organ, emotional stress, and so on. This is why scoliosis is still considered idiopathic. There are simply too many potential causes to establish reproducible statistical data. Moreover, almost every case of scoliosis is unique, and the curve never looks exactly the same because each individual has their own circumstances that manifest the imbalance.
Fascia is not an inert structural component of the body, but forms a network throughout the body that plays a role in proprioception, pain perception, and mechanically connecting muscles and transmitting forces (Wilke et al., 2018). Fascia is well innervated with mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings (Yahia et al., 1992) and is rich in contractile cells, so muscles and fascia can be considered a myofascial unit (Stecco et al., 2009). The muscles of the body are connected through fascia, forming so-called myofascial chains that extend the length and width of the body and can transmit mechanical forces of stress and tension (Wilke et al., 2016).

It is these myofascial chains that stabilize the lumbar vertebrae on the sacral base, without which the lumbar spine would be unable to bear the normal loads it is meant to carry (Willard et al., 2012). It is assumed that these chains may provide new methods for understanding the mentioned pain and justify the development of more comprehensive treatment (Langevin, 2006).
The majority of people today maintain chronic muscle tension in various parts of their bodies.
In fact, the presence of imbalanced stress, as such, is characteristic of almost everyone. Statistically, about 70% of people have some form of spinal deformity (Schwab et al., 2005). However, why do some people develop significant spinal deformity, while others do not?
What is the reasoning behind the idea that certain ""tension configurations"" cause scoliosis, while others do not?
You can think of the body as a map of contractions. If these contractions are more or less random, they will help cancel each other out, and the fascia will know how to adjust all the tensions to work in harmony. However, if some tensions are too strong or persist for a long time in a specific pattern of aligned vectors, without treatment, the result could be spinal deformation.
The fascial system has a threshold of compensatory intensity, beyond which it can function in a self-regulating manner. However, when the intensity exceeds this threshold, the fascial tissues must ""ask for help"" from both the muscular and skeletal systems.
The body perceives emotions as contractions in the fascial tissue. Different emotions are recognized by different contraction configurations.
Repressed emotions manifest as excessively tense fascia, and over time, they create chronic contraction in the affected area, corresponding to the repressed specific emotions.
As a child grows, their emotional processing is not yet fully developed. Any unresolved emotions from the child's experiences are stored in the body. When a person says they have no memories from childhood, it's not because they are stored in the mind, but because they are stored in the body, which is why there are no words for those experiences. These memories are stored without words. The extreme example of this mechanism can be seen in videos of soldiers returning from World War I, who were shell-shocked.

These memories are stored without words. The extreme example of this mechanism can be seen in videos of shell-shocked soldiers returning from World War I.
The body holds memories in fascicular tissue, in different locations depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can lead to reduced function of certain organs, eventually resulting in disease or structural tension, which can lead to scoliosis deformities.
Children who do not like themselves hold tension around their hearts. A sense of not belonging manifests as contraction in the legs. Children who feel pressure to express their emotions will develop tension in the throat, while the lack of safety at home will manifest as digestive issues. Sexual trauma and thigh contractions can also occur.
These contractions hold the memory of experiences as energy of fear, shame, anger, and more, and restrict blood flow in the organs affected by the contraction.
In young children, these contractions manifest as painful emotions and frustration, while in older age, they manifest as diseases in those organs or related structures. For example, repressed emotions related to grief contribute to the formation of a kyphotic curve. Suppressed anger leads to fascial contractions in the liver and contributes to the curvature of the thoracic spine. Repressed fears cause fascial contractions in the kidneys and contribute to the lateral tilting of the lumbar spine.
Children who grow up in high emotional stress environments and are not supported in expressing and processing those emotions will hold these feelings as fascial hypertonia related to specific emotions.

The myofibroblasts present in the fascial tissue are capable of long-term tissue contractions, which can lead to tissue remodeling (Hintz, 2013). Their growing cellular contractions are strong enough to cause about 1 cm of tissue contracture per month (Follonier Castella et al., 2010; Schleip et al., 2019). Fascial contractility can be strong and stable enough to continuously affect the spine over extended periods, ranging from several days to months (Schleip and Klinger, 2019).
The connection between emotions and physiological responses is well-documented (Damasio and Carvalho, 2013; Russell, 2003). The brain can generate sensory-motor activation patterns that can alter an individual’s state (Toivonen et al., 2012). Repressed emotions, stored as embodied memories, can manifest as excessively tense fascia and over time lead to chronic contraction associated with repressed specific emotions (Nummenmaa, 2018; Iani, 2019).


Unresolved emotions during childhood can be internalized and stored as trauma in the body (Ruchkin & Schwab-Stone, 2014). Somatization of trauma in children and adolescents is complex and can be seen in children who are generally more sensitive and suffer from emotional distress (Kealy et al., 2018; Luoni et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2018), and who are especially survivors of cancer (Erickson & Steiner, 1999). Children growing up in high emotional stress environments, who are not supported in expressing and resolving these emotions, will store them as hypertonia within the fascia. The body holds these memories as myofascial trigger points within fascicular tissue, in various locations depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can affect the normal or pathological function of tissues and organs (Langevin, 2006) or manifest as structural tension that may lead to scoliosis deformities. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence, affecting nearly one-third of the adolescent population in the U.S. (Merikangas et al., 2010). Low back pain is associated with psychosocial stress (Erne & Elfering, 2011) and unexplained chest pain is linked to depression and emotional and social functioning disturbances (Eliacik et al., 2019). Anxiety and depression affect kyphosis (Moslehi et al., 2011), and psychological distress in AIS patients has been shown to play an important role in the onset of back pain (Makino et al., 2019). Statistically, girls tend to be more emotionally sensitive than boys, and therefore the greater the sensitivity and amount of stress the body must deal with (Chen et al., 2018). The concept that scoliosis arises from asymmetrical muscle tension was first suggested by Nicolas Andry in the 18th century, who coined the term “Orthopaedics” from the words “straight” (orthos) and “child” (pais) (LeVay, 1990). Andry promoted the theory of “spasmodic muscle contraction” as the cause of spinal deformity. He said, “It should be noted that the curvature of the spine does not always arise from a disorder of the spine itself but is sometimes caused by the excessive shortening of the muscles of the body’s first part, causing the spine to become curved, just as a bow becomes more curved by tightening the string.” Andry used rest, traction, postural approaches, and padded corsets in the treatment of scoliosis. The origin of muscle tension! However, what Andry did not explain was the cause of asymmetrical muscle tension and how it deformed the spine. There are many potential causes of asymmetrical muscle tension, including injury, sports, overuse of one side of the body, neurological disorders, congenital defects, issues with specific organs, emotional stress, and more. This is why scoliosis is still considered idiopathic. There are simply too many potential causes to establish reproducible patterns for statistical data. Moreover, nearly every case of scoliosis is unique, and the curve never looks exactly the same, as each individual has their own circumstances that express the imbalance. In the last two to three decades, an interesting development has been the resurgence of interest in the importance of the connective tissue network, known as fascia, in muscular-skeletal development (Stecco & Schleip, 2016; Adstrum et al., 2017; Stecco et al., 2018), and its role in chronic stress (Schmitter et al., 2010). Fascia is not an inert structural component of the body, but rather forms a network throughout the body, playing a role in proprioception, pain perception, and mechanically connecting muscles and transmitting forces (Wilke et al., 2018). Fascia is well innervated by mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings (Yahia et al., 1992) and is rich in contractile cells so that muscles and fascia can be considered as a myofascial unit (Stecco et al., 2009). The muscles of the body are connected via fascia, forming so-called myofascial chains that extend the body’s length and width and can transmit mechanical forces of stress and tension (Wilke et al., 2016). These myofascial chains stabilize the lumbar vertebrae on the sacral base, without which the lumbar spine would not be able to carry the normal loads it should bear (Willard et al., 2012). It is believed that these chains can provide new methods for understanding the aforementioned pain and justify the development of more comprehensive treatments (Langevin, 2006). Most people nowadays retain chronic muscle tension in parts of their bodies. For example, it is estimated that 16% of the European population suffers from migraines (Olesen et al., 2009). It has been proposed that migraine attacks originate in myofascial trigger points, which are hyperirritable areas that develop in the skeletal muscles (Do et al., 2018). In fact, the presence of imbalanced stress, as such, is characteristic of almost everyone. Statistically, about 70% of people have some form of spinal deformity (Schwab et al., 2005). However, why do some people develop significant spinal deformity while others do not? The myofibroblasts present in the fascial tissue are capable of long-term tissue contractions that can cause tissue remodeling (Hintz, 2013). Their increasing cellular contractions are strong enough to induce approximately 1 cm of tissue contracture per month (Follonier Castella et al., 2010; Schleip et al., 2019). Fascial contractility can be strong and sustained enough to continuously affect the spine over long periods, from several days to months (Schleip & Klinger, 2019). The connection between emotions and physiological responses is well-documented (Damasio & Carvalho, 2013; Russell, 2003). The brain can generate sensory-motor activation patterns that can alter an individual’s state (Toivonen et al., 2012). Suppressed emotions, stored as embodied memories, may manifest as excessively tense fascia and over time cause chronic contractions related to specific suppressed emotions (Nummenmaa, 2018; Iani, 2019). It is suggested that these activation patterns, which work through the fascia, generate long-term muscle tension. When they spread into a specific configuration and intensity, the spine may alter its orientation, and scoliosis develops. This is especially important during emotional stress and growth periods, such as adolescence. (Iani, 2019). The proposed activation patterns that work through the fascia lead to prolonged muscle tension. When they spread into a particular configuration and intensity, the spine can change its alignment, and scoliosis develops. This is particularly significant during emotional stress and periods of rapid growth, as happens in adolescence. Random configuration of fascial tension, which does not lead to scoliosis (A) versus a contraction configuration that leads to scoliosis (B)
Fascia irritation can lead to a variety of local and global responses, such as connective tissue remodeling, inflammation, nervous system sensitization, which eventually follows with the organism’s adaptive response (Langevin & Sherman, 2007). Under certain dysfunctional conditions, the neuro-fascial interaction may be responsible for the “memory” of local tissue or peripheral sensitization, which follows with appropriate structural change (Tozzi, 2014).
Unresolved emotions in childhood can be internalized and stored as trauma in the body (Ruchkin & Schwab-Stone, 2014). Somatization of trauma in children and adolescents is complex and can be seen in children who generally suffer from emotional turmoil (Kealy et al., 2018; Luoni et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2018), and who are survivors of cancer (Erickson & Steiner, 1999). Children growing up in environments with high emotional stress and who are not supported in expressing and resolving those emotions will store these emotions as hypertonia within the fascia. The body holds these memories as myofascial trigger points within fascicular tissue, in different places depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can affect the normal or pathological function of tissues and organs (Langevin, 2006) or manifest as structural tension that may lead to scoliosis deformities (Whyte Ferguson, 2014). Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence. They affect nearly one-third of the adolescent population in the United States (Merikangas et al., 2010). Low back pain is associated with psychosocial stress (Erne & Elfering, 2011) and unexplained chest pain with depression and emotional and social dysfunction (Eliacik et al., 2019). Anxiety and depression affect kyphosis (Moslehi et al., 2011), and psychological distress in AIS patients has been shown to play an important role in the onset of back pain (Makino et al., 2019). Girls are statistically more emotionally sensitive than boys, and therefore the greater the sensitivity and the amount of stress the body has to deal with (Chen et al., 2018). The primary age of scoliosis onset is between 10-15 years, which occurs equally in both sexes. However, females are eight times more likely to progress to a curve size that requires treatment (Raggio, 2006; National Scoliosis Foundation, 2020). The explanation for this is that the female spine grows more than the male spine between the ages of 9-13 years (Taylor & Twomey, 1984). During the growing period before maturity, the transverse diameter of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae grows more in males than in females, and this horizontal growth is accompanied by an increase in muscle mass and strength that occurs during male sexual maturation (Feik & Story, 1983; Twomey et al., 1983). Therefore, the female spine tends to be longer and thinner, especially in the early stages. Hence, it is more likely to deform as AIS is characterized by a smaller vertebral cross-section and higher intervertebral disc height in females (Schultz & Cisewski, 1978; Ponrartana et al., 2016). The explanation for the prevalence of severe scoliosis in girls is that they enter the adolescent growth spurt with inadequate postural mechanisms.

In the next section of the article, I will discuss how to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The theory proposed here is based on the idea that scoliosis is misunderstood and misclassified in Western medicine. The critical impact of fascia on spinal support and shape, as well as the influence of emotions and physical exercise on muscles (Pleuss et al., 2009) and fascia (Bordoni and Marelli, 2017), suggest that AIS is not an orthopedic issue per but rather has psychological and environmental origins. Therefore, it is important to understand that the development of AIS takes time, and correcting it will require time and effort. The earlier it is detected, the greater the chances of reversing it.

I am headed to Cleveland clinic Monday to meet with a neuromuscular specialist. I was diagnosed by my neurologist with myasthenia gravis based on my achr binding ab results and a few symptoms. I will be having my first EMG test Monday as well. Any suggestions on what to wear or how to prepare for it? Bit anxious as I have heard it is painful and unpleasant. I also struggle with fibromyalgia so my pain threshold isn’t the greatest anyways. Any words would be so helpful and greatly appreciated ❤️
Debunking illogical & unethical ‘reasons’ parents use to justify circumcising/mutilating their healthy sons,SaveboysFromKnifeRape,1i92lkn,2025-01-24 13:41:07,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaveboysFromKnifeRape/comments/1i92lkn/debunking_illogical_unethical_reasons_parents_use/,PQKN051502,,"# Unjustifiable reason 1: Parents are clueless about the functions of the foreskin

The truth is foreskins are not useless. Here are some proven [foreskins](https://www.cirp.org/news/1997/1997-12-01_Mothering.php#n31)' [fuctions](http://www.savingsons.org/2015/09/foreskin-and-its-16-functions-not-just.html):

1. **Foreskin covers and protects the glans** (the pink head of the penis) **from: fabric friction, unwanted stimulations, keratinization, and from desensitization.** Having your glans constantly exposed and rubbed against fabrics all the time will result in[ desensitization and keratinization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227011336_Physical_Effects_of_Circumcision). Can you see how rough the fabrics you wear are compared to the internal canal of the female genitalia (vagina)?
2. **Foreskin has a gliding function that acts like lube**. **Foreskin gliding up and down feels much more pleasurable and is more convienient than using lube.**
3. **Foreskin seals in extisting moisture, prevents drying**. It keeps the glans' surface plump, smooth and shiny.
4. **Foreskin also has cells** (such as Langerhans cells) **that secrete immunoglobulin antibodies (which defend us against infections) & antibacterial and antiviral proteins**, including pathogen killing enzyme lysozyme.
5. **Foreskin itself has plenty of nerve endings**. It has coiled fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles, dorsal nerve branches, and specialized erotogenic nerve endings of several types.
6. **Foreskin itself has plenty of veins and blood vessels**, including the frenular artery and branches of the dorsal artery, which **increases blood flow to the shaft and glans of the penis**. Your complete penis will have fewer veins and nerve endings after your foreskin gets removed.

More [functions of foreskin to sexual pleasure](https://www.cirp.org/news/1997/1997-12-01_Mothering.php#n31):

1. **Coverage During Erection**: As it becomes erect, the penile shaft becomes thicker and longer. The double-layered foreskin provides the skin necessary to accommodate the expanded organ and to allow the penile skin to glide freely, smoothly, and pleasurably over the shaft and glans.
2. **Self-Stimulating Sexual Functions**: The foreskin's double-layered sheath enables the penile shaft skin to glide back and forth over the penile shaft. The foreskin can normally be slipped all the way, or almost all the way, back to the base of the penis, and also slipped forward beyond the glans. This wide range of motion is the mechanism by which the penis and the orgasmic triggers in the foreskin, frenulum, and glans are stimulated.
3. **Sexual Functions in Intercourse**: One of the foreskin's functions is to facilitate smooth, gentle movement between the mucosal surfaces of the two partners during intercourse. The foreskin enables the penis to slip in and out of the vagina nonabrasively inside its own slick sheath of self-lubricating, movable skin. The female is thus stimulated by moving pressure rather than by friction only, as when the male's foreskin is missing.

Circumcision might also remove a part of the frenulum (which looks like a string) and might make the frenulum less visible. The frenulum area is one of the most sensitive and pleasurable parts of the penis.

# Unjustifiable reason 2: Parents believe the 'circumcision prevents diseases' myth

**Circumcision is proven not to prevent STDs, not STIs either. It is harmful to spread this 'circumcision prevents HIV' myth.** It is possible that many circumcised men out there believe this myth and have unprotected sex because they think they are immune to STDs. Condoms are cheap and effective.

So the 'it prevents diseases' reason falls flat. Also, **it is unethical and harmful to surgically remove a healthy functional part of an unconsenting healthy human's genital because you want to 'prevent them from diseases'**

Here are some studies that debunked that myth:

# Unjustifiable reason 3: Parents think circumcised penises look better

It is cruel, vain, and disgusting to use circumcision as a cosmetic surgery on your small children. Attempting to 'beautify' your children's genitals by forcing cosmetic surgery, either non-reversible or reversible, on your small children is immoral and severely abusive.

If it is illegal to give your newborn daughters cosmetic surgeries, then it should be illegal to give your newborn sons cosmetic surgeries.

Plus, cosmetic surgery is supposed to make things look better. But circumcision does not make anything look better. If you are an adult man and you want to circumcise yourself for cosmetic purposes, please read this: Just fully retract your own foreskin and it will look like a circumcised penis (minus the scars, discolorations, missing veins, missing nerve-endings and keratinized glans).

# Unjustifiable reason 4: Parents think it is cleaner

[Children's foreskin is attached, or 'fused' to the glans usually until around puberty](http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/kayaba/), leaving nothing underneath to clean. In a newborn male, the foreskin cannot be retracted and can only be separated from the glans by force.

Also, cleaning an intact adult penis is faster than cleaning your face or brushing your teeth. Mutilating a functional part of your son's healthy sexual organ because you want it to be cleaner is a harmful thing to do. And it is not even difficult to clean an adult penis that has phimosis either unless it is way too severe.

# Unjustifiable reason 5: Some parents believe in 'religious freedom' only for themselves but not for their children.

It is okay for you to have any religion you want, but you cannot force it upon your helpless sons. He deserves religious freedom as well. It is hypocritical for you to demand religious freedom when you yourself do not give your own son religious freedom.

Circumcision is a painful non-reversible surgery, it might leave scars and discolorations that he might have to look at every day. it removes plenty of veins and nerve endings. It removes all the functions foreskin has. It has risks, either low or not, it has risks.

# When it is not reasonable even if there is a medical diagnosis:

# Unreasonable: Parents use it as a treatment for mild cases of phimosis before considering other safer options.

**In healthy male children,** [foreskins are attached to the glans](https://cuaj.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/5033)**, cannot be retracted and can only be separated from the glans by force. Children having their foreskin attached to their glans is not a diseased condition. It is normal for young males not able to retract their foreskin. Force retraction on children can cause tearing, pain, inflammations and other problems. Usually, during puberty, the foreskin will start to retract itself.**

So it is harmful to circumcise an 8-year-old boy because his foreskin cannot retract. It is normal for children not able to have exposed glans since they are not supposed to be sexually active.

There are plenty of safer options to deal with phimosis, such as stretching. There are plenty of men with severe phimosis who began with extremely tight foreskin (the size of a pinpoint) and loosened their foreskin over time with stretching and other methods, ending up successfully retracting their foreskin completely without surgery.

# Removal of tissue is the last ditch effort of medical treatment. Circumcision should only be the last resort in any problem. Circumcision is only justifiable in medical diagnoses that have no other safer and less invasive treatments.

There are also other less invasive procedures than circumcision, such as **preputioplasty**.

**Preputioplasty** is a surgical procedure that widens a tight foreskin to treat severe cases of phimosis. During preputioplasty, an incision is made on either side of the foreskin to widen it. **Preputioplasty allows the patient to keep their foreskin & its functions, unlike circumcision. Circumcision removes the foreskin. Meanwhile preputioplasty wildens the foreskin.**

If circumcision is used as the last resort in most severe cases of adult phimosis where the foreskin is way too tight to even see the urinary meatus (the pee-hole/slit). Doctors still should not remove all the foreskin they can remove. Doctors should minimize the amount of nerve endings and veins removed and avoid removing the frenulum. They can just remove a very small part and the patient can do stretching afterward to minimize the amount of tissue removed.

In children, severe phimosis cases where the foreskin is way too tight for the kid to urinate, doctors should still minimize the amount of tissue removed. There is no reason for doctors to remove as much foreskin as they can. In cases like that, doctors still should minimize the nerve endings and veins removed and avoid removing the frenulum.

Trump Urges NATO Allies to Boost Defence Spending to 5% of GDP,Junior_Stocks,1i91y3g,2025-01-24 13:13:47,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Junior_Stocks/comments/1i91y3g/trump_urges_nato_allies_to_boost_defence_spending/,JuniorStocksCom,,"Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-urges-nato-allies-to-boost-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp](https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-urges-nato-allies-to-boost-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp)

Trump’s 5% NATO Defence Spending Proposal Sparks Global Debate

https://preview.redd.it/rhcyjmodgzee1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=77f4456cc5d27305814b2cddd75bf4aac19d540a

In a statement that sent ripples through the geopolitical landscape, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States will urge NATO member countries to boost their defence spending to 5% of GDP. Speaking virtually at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump characterized the proposed increase as long overdue, asserting that NATO’s previous targets were insufficient to meet modern security challenges.

“I’m going to ask all NATO nations to increase defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,” Trump declared. He also noted his previous efforts to ensure member nations met the existing 2% target, a standard many countries had failed to achieve prior to his first term.

**Canada’s Defence Spending Shortfall**

For Canada, this ambitious proposal would necessitate a dramatic surge in defence expenditures. Currently spending approximately 1.37% of GDP on defence, the Canadian government remains far below NATO's existing 2% benchmark. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to meet the 2% target by 2032, but experts question whether this timeline aligns with NATO's evolving expectations.

David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, estimates that meeting Trump’s proposed 5% target would cost Canada an additional $100 billion annually—a monumental leap for a country that has struggled to address its current defence obligations.

“We don’t have any plan to reach 2%,” Perry noted, “so any target beyond that is going to add another degree of complexity and difficulty.”

**A New Era of NATO Spending?**

Trump’s remarks underscore a broader shift within NATO, where defence spending is increasingly viewed as a baseline rather than an aspirational goal. In July 2024, then-NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg declared that the 2% target should now serve as the floor, not the ceiling, for defence contributions.

Poland, for example, has already exceeded the 2% benchmark, allocating 4.12% of its GDP to defence. However, no member nation currently reaches the 5% threshold proposed by Trump. Even the United States, with its massive military budget, spends roughly 3.38% of GDP on defence, according to NATO estimates.

**Canada’s Strategic Dilemma**

Canada’s reluctance to accelerate its defence spending could leave it vulnerable to mounting international criticism. Analysts suggest that Ottawa has underestimated the growing importance of defence contributions within NATO, particularly under Trump’s renewed leadership.

“Canada has significantly misread this to be something that was a phenomenon of the first Trump administration,” Perry explained, highlighting the country’s lack of a concrete plan to meet the alliance’s standards.

Prime Minister Trudeau defended his government’s record, pointing to increased investments in Arctic security and northern defence. However, critics argue that these measures fall short of what is required to maintain Canada’s standing within NATO.

**The Financial and Political Fallout**

Raising defence spending to 5% of GDP would represent an unprecedented financial commitment for NATO member countries, including Canada. The political implications are equally significant, as governments face the challenge of balancing domestic priorities with international obligations.

For Canada, this could mean reallocating funds from other critical areas, such as healthcare and infrastructure, to meet NATO’s expectations. The prospect of such drastic budgetary changes is likely to ignite intense debate within Parliament and among the Canadian public.

**Conclusion**

Trump’s push for a 5% defence spending target signals a pivotal moment for NATO. While the proposal aims to bolster collective security in an increasingly volatile world, it also raises pressing questions about fiscal responsibility and global priorities.

For Canada, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Meeting even the existing 2% target has proven elusive, and Trump’s latest proposal will only amplify the pressure on Ottawa to step up its defence commitments. Whether Canada can navigate this complex landscape remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the stakes have never been higher."

'What the-'

The wind sways the branches and the leaves rattle in turn.

'Didn't I die?'

My fingers are slipping. I'm going to fall again. I look down at the flowers. I turn to get a wider berth. I need to roll into the fall.

I let go. Air rushes past me. I bend my legs as I prepare to roll.

The impact crosses over my shoulder and onto my back. Pedals splash up from our meeting. I'm gonna feel like death tomorrow, or today if I'm lucky.

'I... died. But I'm alive now? Did I take a nap, somewhere along the line of, hanging by one hand?'

I get to my feet and dust myself off. I dropped my flashlight when I needed both hands, so I look for it.

'Who was that woman? I broke my legs, and it felt so real. What happened to me?'

I find the flashlight in the flowers undamaged.

""Lucky!"" I say so to no one in particular. I test the flashlight. The flashlight illuminates the vastness of the drop I suffered. 

""How did I survive that?"" My voice echoes down the corridor. I pull myself away from the situation.

I stroll up to a vast doorway. Two columns accent the threshold. My journey begins. 

An oasis of light pierces the darkness. A patch of grass settles at the center. An ordinary sunflower droops under a ray of light. This feels weird, like I'm about to witness something I shouldn't.

My boots clap against the rock as I walk up to it and beyond.

""Golly, you're new."" A voice bounces off the walls.

The flower stiffens up. 

""I guess explanations are due."" The flower turns toward me and smiles.

'A talking flower is talking to me and I can understand it.'

I check my head for blood, but there is none.

""You look confused, never talked to a flower before huh?"" The flower stays their smile with a hint of sass.

""Human, welcome to the underground. From the petals on your clothes I gather the fall was not fun."" The flower winks at me.

I find my voice. ""Yeah you could say that.""

""I'm guessing you want a tour of the place. Well, you came to the right flower. Howdy. I'm Flowey, Flowey the flower.""

""Now before you go any further there are some things you need to know."" Flowey's face shifts ever so slightly. His smile fades and his eyes darken almost imperceptibly.

""Beyond this doorway monsters roam. They will try to take your soul. Which means you die."" He grins.

""So don't let them."" He winks at me.

I stand arms akimbo as I speak up. ""How do I know you are telling me the truth? That these monsters are going to try to take my soul.""

""Trust me. All I'm saying is you should watch your back. You never know, kay?"" Flowey drops to a smirk.

""When you encounter a monster who wants to fight, your soul will appear. They will use magic to attack your soul. You have to dodge their attacks."" Flowey focuses on their explanation forgetting to smile for the hundredth time.

""Allow me to demonstrate."" Flowey smiles.

A purple soul appears in front of my chest. 

""That is your SOUL. The very culmination of your being. Your soul starts off weak, but it can grow stronger.""

Flowey blips small, white seeds into existence.

""Dodge these.""

The seeds race toward me. I lunge out of the way, and they sail by me.

""Good job. Too easy, huh?"" He smirks.

""You need LOVE to become stronger. Staying weak turns to staying dead in these caverns. Head on through that doorway, so we can get this show on the road.""

I pass through the doorway. A small room serves as the welcome mat. Six stone plates lay at my right. A lever hangs beside a door. A plaque on the door reads /Only the fearless may proceed. Brave ones, Foolish ones. Both walk not the middle road./ 

Flowey explains the puzzle from the other room, and I solve it promptly. The door swings out with a resounding gong."

Am I being dumb for paying off my student loan?,UKPersonalFinance,1i90zu3,2025-01-24 12:35:07,9,0.64,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1i90zu3/am_i_being_dumb_for_paying_off_my_student_loan/,urbanwomble,,"26M 

I’m very lucky to have a small student loan of £8.6k (in comparison to others) that has around 4.3% interest applied. 

I earn 30k so I am not hitting the threshold for payments to be taken from my salary. 

Seeing the loan gradually increase year on year has got me a bit nervous, so I have set up a standing order of £200 per month to service it. 

These funds have been taxed which if they came off my salary they wouldn’t have been. If anyone knows if it is possible to opt in to pay off the loan from my salary that would be helpful. 

The advice I have seen is to ignore the loan and if/when I reach the threshold then I should treat it like a tax. I certainly would consider this appropriate advice if the loan was significant but I think 8.6k is manageable so it would be wise to get rid of it before it amounts to a greater sum. 

I have 2k saved in an emergency fund and 1.5k in a S&S ISA. I also have a holiday/fun fund of £1k. I contribute £100 into the ISA a month but have decided to stop adding to my emergency fund to pay the loan. Not looking to buy a home any time soon, no other debts.

Any thoughts would be welcome. Last thing I would add is though I shouldn’t occupy my mind with this, sometimes it keeps me up at night.

Nike Pegasus Plus - Follow Up Review after 500km,RunningShoeGeeks,1i90yek,2025-01-24 12:33:30,96,0.99,19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i90yek,highdon,Review,"I have now covered over 300 miles (500km) in my Pegasus Plus. See my initial 100km review here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1eyuiy5/nike_pegasus_plus_100km_review_best_uptempo_daily

As I haven’t seen many reviews since the launch, I thought I will give you fellow geeks an update on this model.

Just to repeat from my last review for those of you too lazy to click on the link:

My profile: 
32 m, 184cm (6 ft), 79kg (174 lbs), forefoot striker, currently in marathon training doing 40-50mpw.

Distance covered: 498km (309 miles)

What I used it for: Easy to recovery mid-week run (5:40 – 6:30 min/km) up to 10 km; Mid-week club track workouts – variety of 400s, 800s, 1k, 1 mile workouts typically up to 12 km (paces anything between 3:30 min/km  to 4:30 min/km)

In my initial review I said this was the best up-tempo trainer since Speed 2. I still stand by that statement, although I found some gaps where the Speed 2 was more suitable, and Peg Plus is less so. There is a good reason for that. What are the gaps? Well, the Peg Plus has a very traditional feeling to it. This is not a pro or con, but rather a characteristic. This is the no-nonsense feeling I described in my first review. They don’t have an aggressive rocker, bouncy platform, or stability features. They are therefore a bit too “basic” for a run where you would like to see the roll/bounce, eg. longer tempo/threshold segments. Even though it was not unpleasant, I can honestly admit that for those type of workouts, I was reaching for other more suitable shoes like the Superblast 2 or more recently the Evo SL.

One thing I did not mention in the first review is that when I first got these shoes I was nursing a mild case of plantar fasciitis. It was something that I picked up during my house move last summer and continued all the way until recently, but never stopped me from running. Why do I mention this? Because I honestly believe that running in the Peg Plus benefited my recovery. I do not often say things like this, as I firmly believe that physiotherapy is always the solution, but in this case I could feel relief in that area from my feet working a bit harder than other stiffer shoes I own. This is to do with the flexibility and geometry they offer – a rare thing in the world of modern heavily rockered, max stack and plated trainers, where your feet experience a limited range of movement. This, in addition to the rehab work, allowed me to fully resolve the PF issues in a few months which I am well chuffed with.

I am not going to repeat myself on the feeling of midsole, outsole or upper. They all performed the same (brilliantly) from day one throughout the 500 km of running. I go back to my original review and I can confirm that I still stand by everything I wrote there. It was only in the last 50km where I started noticing that they were going a bit flat and bottoming out. This is not unusual for my shoes though and you can read more on that here, where I explain why I retire most of my shoes between around 500-600km mark:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1fdcwkj/why_we_change_shoes_when_they_still_have_plenty/

In terms of durability the Peg Plus held up brilliantly. The outsole is like new, so is the upper. The midsole shows creasing which is typical for all ZoomX shoes, but this is only visual. I plan on putting them in the washing machine soon and continue using them for casual wear and other sports/gym.

I know the most controversial thing about this model is the price, especially on the US market where if I understand correctly, they only cost $20 less than the Superblasts 2. I can’t comment on other markets but from my perspective in the UK where I live these shoes have been readily available since launch for about £120 with different retailers, which is similar to what you can get the Rebel v4, Novablast 4/5 and the Evo SL for. I paid peanuts for my pair due to being given some Nike gift cards, but I wouldn’t be disappointed if I paid the full £120. Perhaps a bit underwhelmed if I paid the RRP of £165, but at £120 they are well worth it. I suspect we will see them sub-£100 in sales later this year as all retailers seem to hold an abundance of inventory in the typical Nike fashion.

As a conclusion, I am going to say that I was happy to use these in my off-season months, where I did less long distance running and more speed work and shorter races. Now that I am back to marathon training, I will be using them a lot less and replacing them with the Evo SL which are better suited for the types of workouts I have planned. I will be glad to go back to the trustworthy Peg Plus when the HMs/marathons are out of the way and I get a bit of a break from longer distances.

It is a great choice if: a) you’re not running longer than 8-10 miles and want a versatile neutral trainer; b) you run long distances but have a dedicated shoe for those; c) don’t like stiff midsoles and prefer a traditional feeling shoe"

TO BE EUTHANIZED IN NYC

He's come such a LONG way since his arrival back in mid-October.  Subwoofer arrived emaciated, his ribs protruding, a victim of neglect.  He's waited SO long for a family only to be disappointed.  Now the shelter wants to kill him for being stressed in this chaotic place?  Subwoofer is a wonderful guy, and he's been failed so many times by humans.  Isn't it time he knows what it is to be loved and cherished?  Please share him far and wide.  He was on the list before, reserved by a rescue, only to have THEM fail him too!   MESSAGE OUR PAGE if you can foster or adopt him and save his life!

Prior lead in paragraph:  As you can tell by his photos, poor SUBWOOFER not only has a pretty lousy shelter name, but he also has waited since pumpkins were on the vine for a family to call his own. When he arrived back in mid-October, he was emaciated with his ribs sticking out of his dull, patchy coat. We can’t imagine the hunger he suffered at the hands of humans. But despite it all, the staff made note of how very sweet and friendly he was with everyone. Put on extra meals, he has since gained over 10 lbs and is filling out nicely. Subwoofer is silly and sweet, playful and loving. He just needs a family of his own now to love. Can you take him in? If you are an experienced foster or adopter, MESSAGE OUR PAGE for assistance.

WHAT MY FRIENDS AT ACC SAY ABOUT ME:
My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet.
I would do best in a home without very tiny humans, although I could be open to older children once I meet them.
I am playful and cute.
I will need daily physical activity to keep me healthy and happy!

PLAYGROUP NOTES – DOG TO DOG SUMMARY
10/30/24:
Subwoofer greets another dog at the gate with tense body. He barks and jumps on the gate.

ENRICHMENT NOTES

1/4/25- ACS called K9 behavior on their phone. When K9 behavior came out to the play yard, ACS staff was in the first pen and in the vestibule. Subwoofer was still on drag leash in the main pen. ACS staff reported when sitting on the bench Subwoofer came over to them and started to jump on them getting mouthy. Handler stood up and Subwoofer continued jumping on them and biting at their clothes. Handler held their slip lead horizontal for Subwoofer to go for that. Subwoofer started to bite at the leash and handler ran into vestibule closing the door behind them making a barrier between them and Subwoofer. K9 handlers used a treat lure on the other side of the door to the pen. When attempting to leash Subwoofer, he jumped up and tried to bite at handler's hand. Second handler kept making a treat lure and first handler was finally able to leash. When the door was opened, Subwoofer exited and kept trying to jump on first handler with an open mouth. Second handler attempted to leash but Subwoofer kept moving. First handler tossed a bunch of treats on the ground, while Subwoofer was occupied eating them second handler was able to leash successfully. Subwoofer didn't thrash nor was vocal while on a double. Handlers didn't clip and he was returned to kennel without issue. Handlers used a hook to remove the leashes, Subwoofer bit at the hook. One handler fed him treats while the second handler removed the leashes. Leashes were successfully removed.

12/8/24- Subwoofer is at the front of the kennel barking with a neutral body, when handler unlocks his door he barks at the wall of the neighboring dog. Handler offered a treat, which he took. Handler used a treat lure and he was easily leashed. When he exits his kennel he pulls towards the pop up in the hallway, handler tugs him away and puts him on the other side of them as they pass other crates. Handler tosses treats all over the floor while waiting at the elevator to distract him from dogs in crates. He is taken to the play yard and is placed on a drag leash. He relieves himself, then jumps on the bench to look at the neighboring pen with a dog. Handler calls to him and he comes over, he takes treats with a slight pressure and is given to him with an open palm. Handler plays fetch which he switches off the tennis balls. He stops momentarily and go to the neighboring fence, the dog in the other pen comes over and Subwoofer muzzles punches the fence along with barking. Handler grabs his drag leash and tugs away, presenting a treat which he follows. He follows the command to sit and he takes the treat. Handler goes back to fetch, when the handler holds the tennis ball for too long Subwoofer demand barks. Handler has him sit then tosses the ball. He is easily leashed and clipped, he returned to his kennel without issue.

Summary (7):: 11/20/24: Upon approaching the kennel, Subwoofer is right at the front with a soft body. As the handler is unlocking the kennel, Subwoofer is jumping up and down, and he does the same when the handler is attempting to leash him. Before taking him out, the handler gave him some treats. While walking out the room, the handler tossed treats onto the floor and Subwoofer eats them. The handler brought him out to the street with ease. During the walk, Subwoofer would turn to the handler for treats, and he would receive some. When bringing him back into the room, Subwoofer would focus on the dogs while passing by. He was brought into his kennel with ease.

10/30/24: Subwoofer is standing at the front of the kennel with a soft body. As handler reaches for the lock, Subwoofer jumps up and down playfully. He is taken for a street walk where he pulls moderate to hard, during the walk Subwoofer is easily called back to the handler. Subwoofer sees multiple dogs and his body tenses and he hyper fixates on them as they pass by, handler is unable to redirect with a squeaker or treat toss. However when handler spotted a dog from a distance and steps to the side, handler was able to retain Subwoofers focus as he sat and continued to ate treats until the dog passes by. Subwoofer was returned to kennel with ease.

10/24/24: Subwoofer is standing in the front of his kennel as handler approaches. He is leashed without issue and brought out to the street for his walk. He pulls moderately out the room and walks calmly to the street. Once outside he pulls lightly and walks past people on the street without issue. When spotting a dog Subwoofer ignores them and uses the bathroom while outside. He is then brought into the behavior office for his assessment. Once inside he begins taking treats previously tossed on the ground and is slightly aloof and is difficult to gain his attention. He allows collaring while being distracted with treats and tolerates handling around his whole body. He is re-leashed and returned to kennel without issue.

10/23/24:(Late Entry) Subwoofer is observed to bark at other dogs while in the yard.

INTAKE BEHAVIOR:
Date of intake: 22-Oct-2024
Summary: Reported to be friendly.

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR:
Date of initial: 23-Oct-2024
Summary: Friendly

ENERGY LEVEL:
We have no history on Subwoofer so we cannot be certain of their behavior in a home environment. However, they will need daily mental and physical activity to stay engaged and exercised. We recommend long-lasting chews, food puzzles, and hide-and-seek games, in additional to physical exercise, to positively direct their energy and enthusiasm.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION: New Hope Only

Recommendations:
No children (under 13)
Recommend no dog parks
Place with a New Hope partner

Recommendations comments:

No young children (under 13): Due to a low threshold for arousal we recommend a home with no children.

Recommend no dog parks: Due to the concerning behaviors that Subwoofer has shown during playgroup (see DOG-DOG SUMMARY), we feel that Subwoofer should not visit dog parks due to his selectivity. The Behavior Department recommends that he be socialized in a more controlled setting until his behavior toward other dogs can be further addressed.

We recommend placement with a New Hope rescue partner who is able to provide an experienced, adult-only foster home. Force-free, reward based training and/or consultation with a professional trainer/behaviorist is highly recommended.

Potential challenges:
On-leash reactivity/barrier frustration
Low threshold for arousal

Potential challenges comments:

On Leash Reactivity: During his stay in shelter Subwoofer has been observed to bark at other dogs while on leash.

Low Threshold Arousal: Subwoofer has been observed to quickly become over aroused and begin to jump up on handlers and mouth them. This behavior is not able to be redirected easily. Subwoofer should be rewarded with treats when calm. If they escalate to jumping or mouthing, people should immediately walk away from and separate themselves from Subwoofer. Please see handout on Arousal.

TO BE EUTHANIZED IN NYC

The shelter wants to take his life for being so lonely and stressed he is chewing on his kennel bars and....once....grabbed a handler's treat bag.  Seriously?

We feel so badly for HERCULES and for a multitude of reasons. He is 8 years old and was bounced from one family to another a year and a half ago. His family said he had a history of seizures, but then gave him up for allergies. He’s been at the shelter for over a month and now they put him on the list and only have 2 photos for us to share, and neither show what a beautiful boy he is. Hercules has never been anything except friendly, outgoing, playful and sweet with everyone he meets, and he lived with two children and adored them. Playful with other dogs, and with a sterling resume, he should have been laying in soft beds with a committed family in a stable home where he would know he was loved and never have to be abandoned in a shelter again. Hercules is perfect – he’s perfectly housetrained, he never guards his things, he knows the commands for sit, stay, go to your bed, and get down. He loves bath time and he’s never hurt a fly. Only his heart gets shattered – every time. Please see the lovely boy that Hercules is and see beyond his current anxiety that has developed over being incarcerated for so long he is losing hope. Let’s give Hercules hope….and more than that, a home. If you are an experienced foster or adopter who can save his life, hurry and MESSAGE OUR PAGE for assistance.

What my friends at ACC say about me:
I lived with children in my previous home.
I have medical needs that staff will address with you when you meet me.
I am a sweet, social, older gentleman, looking for the perfect forever home!
I am finding the shelter a little overwhelming, but when it's just you and me and some peace and quiet you'll see what a love bug I am.
I will flourish in a calm environment and a low-traffic home.

PLAYGROUP NOTES – DOG TO DOG SUMMARY
12/17/24: Hercules greets another dog at the gate with a tense face and neutral body. he begins to whine with high tail wag.

ENRICHMENT NOTES

1/13/25: ACS reports that Hercules started jumping up, grabbing, pulling, and shaking their treat pouch. When the handler unclipped the treat pouch, Hercules began to rip up part of the treat bag.

1/1/25: Hercules is observed to be biting his kennel bars. When handlers go to leash him, it is reported that he is pushing his way out of kennel.

12/14/24: Hercules was observed to bark at the transfer door at the back of his kennel. He stops and comes to the front when called by handler and takes a treat offered.

12/12/24: Hercules is observed to be biting at the bars of the kennel.

12/6/24: Hercules is standing at the front of his kennel as handler approaches. He is leashed while distracted with treats and walked out to the street for his walk. While outside Hercules pulls hard and walks past people without issue accept for two people he fixates on. In both instances he is redirected by calling his name, he also spots some dogs on his walk but is uninterested and passes them without issue. He is then brought into the behavior office for an assessment, during which he approaches handlers and accepts treats softly from hand. He tolerates collaring but at one point when adjusting the collar he turns his head with an open mouth towards handlers hand as the collar is being adjusted but overall is distracted by treats. He allows petting from handlers while distracted with more treats and after finishing hs assessment is brought back to kennel and returned without issue.

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR:
Date of initial:: 12/4/2024
Summary:: Tense body, whale eyes

ENERGY LEVEL:
Hercules is described as active and enthusiastic. He will need daily mental and physical activity to keep him engaged and exercised. We recommend long-lasting chews, food puzzles, and hide-and-seek games, in additional to physical exercise, to positively direct his energy and enthusiasm. We recommend feeding with puzzle feeders and food-dispensing toys. And we recommend only force-free, reward-based training techniques for Hercules

IN SHELTER OBSERVATIONS:: 12/26/24: After Hercules assessment, his collar was being adjusted by a staff member. Hercules displayed whale eyes, turned his head and display small ""chomps"" near his hand but did not make contact or growl or bark.

BEHAVIOR DETERMINATION:: Level 4

Recommendations::
No children (under 13)

Recommendations comments:
No children (under 13): Due to Hercules fearful behavior and what he displays after his assessment (see In-Shelter Observation) Hercules should go to a home with older behavioral savvy children.

Potential challenges:
Resource guarding
Basic manners/poor impulse control
Mouthiness/poor bite inhibition
Handling/touch sensitivity
Fearful/potential for defensive aggression
Anxiety
Strength/leash pulling

Potential challenges comments:

Resource guarding: During his assessment Hercules hover over a toy. Positive reinforcement should be utilized to help manage this behavior. Please see the handout on Resource Guarding.

Basic Manners/ Mouthiness: Hercules has been observed to jump up and mouth handlers treat bags. It is recommended that default behaviors such as ""Sit"" and ""Off"" are reinforced to substitute any frustration and teach them to control their impulses instead of simply reacting; proper management is also advised. Force-free, reward-based training only is recommended. Please see handout on Basic Manners. Please see handout on mouthiness.

Handling/touch sensitivity: Hercules displayed discomfort with some handling towards the end of his assessment. Treats and toys should be paired with handling to make Hercules comfortable. Please see the handout on Handling/touch sensitivity.

Fearful/potential for defensive aggression: Hercules is noted to growl/bark when he is disturbed, and noted to initially hard bark at strangers when approached. We recommend Hercules to initiate interactions with new people. He should never be forced to greet or to interact if he is not comfortable and soliciting attention. Hercules would do best in an initially calm and quiet home environment and should be given time to acclimate to his new surroundings. See handouts on Decompression Period and Fearful and Defensive Aggression.

Anxiety: Hercules is noted to be anxious. If he displays anxious behavior in his future home, we recommend puzzle toys, long walks, and giving him other things to focus on to alleviate his anxiety. Positive reinforcement, force-free training only should be used.

Strength/leash pulling: Hercules is a large, strong dog with the capability to pull over an average adopter, so his adopter must be prepared and able to handle a dog of this size and strength. It is recommended that he be walked on a front clip harness or head halter, which help diminish his strength through leverage, and that he be trained using positive reinforcement, reward-based training to not pull on leash.

ADHD diagnostic’s results,ADHD,1i906nd,2025-01-24 12:02:09,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1i906nd/adhd_diagnostics_results/,Dry_Plov_1771,Questions/Advice,"So, I have got my diagnostic’s results and.. I haven’t got diagnosis. What should I do in this situation (me and my psychiatrist are sure that I have ADHD) translation of my diagnostics results will be attached as well, thank you in advance!! Here’s the revised translation:

**“Analysis of ASEBA results according to DSM scales does not reveal clinically significant values.
ASEBA – the results on the ADHD scale approach borderline values (64 T) but do not reach clinically significant thresholds. This indicates moderate changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition processes, which currently do not reflect a pathological condition.

The assessment of ASEBA results according to syndrome scales reveals elevated (clinically significant) values on the Attention Problems scale (77 T). This indicates attention deficit, manifested by weak abilities to concentrate attention. The patient is often forgetful and chaotic. Planning for the future and prioritizing tasks are challenging.

The borderline indicator on the Atypical Thinking scale (66 T) reveals subjectivity in evaluating people and phenomena, uniqueness in perception and judgments, and independence of opinions.

Conclusions
Evaluating the psychological assessment results of the patient, it can be concluded that the difficulties identified do not currently reach the level of a disorder. No disturbances in excitation and inhibition processes were identified using the ASEBA method.

Recommendations
I recommend applying individual psychotherapy.”**"
This Survey Site is Looking for Participants Worldwide!,PaidSurveysOnline,1i904xh,2025-01-24 12:00:26,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidSurveysOnline/comments/1i904xh/this_survey_site_is_looking_for_participants/,workdreambig,,"I've tested hundreds of different survey sites, and one problem is that many are often limited to certain countries.

But there's one that's available in almost all locations. It's called [Surveoo](https://surveyleo.com/join-surveoo/). I recently tested it to see how you can earn by taking surveys.

First off, Surveoo is a legit survey site. You sign up, and then you can start answering surveys for cash. They show you how much you’ll earn and how long the survey should take right up front. It’s pretty straightforward.

The main way to earn is, of course, taking surveys. You’ll see them on your dashboard when you log in.

They also have a bonus section where you can earn extra rewards for leaving reviews or adding the site to your phone’s home screen.

You can invite your friends and receive a cut of their earnings (but it won't be deducted from their earnings). This is called ""sponsorship.""

The amount you can earn per survey varies but can be around $0.50 to $1.50. Some surveys may pay as high as $9 or even $11, but those are rare.

The rate also depends on your country. Be honest with your answers, as they are checked for consistency, which might impact how many surveys you are offered.

You can withdraw your earnings through PayPal, direct bank transfer, or Amazon gift cards. The minimum payout threshold is about $20. It may vary, depending on your country and the payment method.

Don’t expect to get rich, but it’s an option if you have some free time and want to earn some pocket money.

Life and consciousness are fundamentally irreducible to physics and chemistry,DebateAnAtheist,1i9008z,2025-01-24 11:55:00,0,0.03,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1i9008z/life_and_consciousness_are_fundamentally/,PineappleWeak3723,Argument,"**Background**

Several days ago I posted an argument for God on the basis of consciousness. Without going into detail, the gist of the argument was/is, if science can't explain how consciousness arises from matter, perhaps we have it backwards and should examine the model where matter arises from consciousness.

In other words, instead of viewing all matter as embedded in space, let's presume all matter is embedded in consciousness (i.e., wherever there isn't matter there is consciousness, which is a substance that is not material). Under this model, matter is a mathematical abstraction that is generated by the consciousness in which it is embedded. One could view this model as something similar to simulation theory, except the computer that runs the simulation is consciousness.

At the very least this resolves how simple organisms become animated and how advanced organisms become fully conscious. Under this model, conceptually, once a cell has all the components necessary for life, the consciousness that already exists inside the boundaries of the cell gets carved out of the greater whole like a cookie would using a cookie cutter. (note: this isn't a technical description, just a way of conveying a concept).

To the consciousness that is carved out, matter is completely ""real"" since matter is what enables its existence. And just like that the two biggest mysteries related to the human experience get resolved.

Anyway, the two predominant responses to the argument were: (1) there's a ton of evidence which proves that consciousness is generated by the brain and therefore is entirely physical, or alternatively (2) just because we don't understand how matter accounts for everything yet doesn't mean we won't. Things just take time. This happens all the time in science.

I responded in the comments why, in my view, even though no one questions the neurological evidence, both of these assertions are not viable in principle, or at the very least are highly unlikely.

Since no one responded to my response, below I am posting, in isolation, a sub argument that life and consciousness are irreducible to physics and chemistry in principle, and therefore consciousness must be, or at least most likely is, fundamental. I'll also briefly address why the neurological research and evidence regarding consciousness is consistent and expected if consciousness is presumed fundamental.

Lets all agree in advance that this alone would not prove that any kind of God exists, only that consciousness is a fundamental substance.

**The argument that life and consciousness are fundamentally irreducible to physics and chemistry.**

Arguably, the most distinguishing characteristic between living beings and inanimate objects is that all living beings act subjectively, even if only instinctively. And by subjectively I mean in a self-oriented and self-interested manner. 

Unlike inanimate objects, living beings are a bounded collection of matter that continually assesses and reacts to the environment (consciously, subconsciously, or instinctively) in relation to how it benefits or harms the collection (i.e., the self).     

Every organism, even if only a single cell, exhibits some type of of drive to reproduce and some type of will to live (at least up until it reproduces). Evolution may not have any goals, but individual organisms certainly do and they include at least these two. In sentient beings, the sense of self and the assessment of events in terms or positive or negative in relation to the self are far more refined and pronounced. 

The will to live and the drive to reproduce with an attractive partner are the secret sauce that drove evolution, and it's a sauce that physics and chemistry seemingly can't explain.

In physics and chemistry, every physical property of every physical or chemical entity ultimately determines only two things: the positioning and motion of the entity's components in space, and how those will change if it interacts with another entity.

This directly follows from the fact that all physical interactions in nature are governed by the four fundamental forces, and the only things that these forces dictate are the motion, attraction, repulsion, and composition of the physical entities that physics and chemistry describe.

The rules and constraints get fabulously complex, but that's the only behavior that physics and chemistry explain. By definition. There's simply nothing beyond that. In relation to life, the most one could theoretically do under the laws of physics and chemistry would be to gradually build something akin to biochemical computers or robots, which is basically what we did ourselves.

As such, there is seemingly no way to reconcile how subjectivity, will, desire, fear, pain, hunger, pleasure, elation, and in general the assessment of events in terms or ""positive"" or ""negative"" in relation to a sense of self could ""emerge,"" strongly or weakly, from the laws of physics and chemistry. It seems impossible in principle or at the very least incoherent. Subjective aims and subjective experience simply can't be reduced to those terms.

Fear, for example, is not a trait that can be explained as coming into existence via mutation if it is presumed that living beings are only comprised of matter that behaves according to the laws of physics. There's a difference between a viable physical trait that has a chemical explanation and traits that are equivalent in essence or concept to fear, pain, will, desire or drive, which are fundamentally subjective. Natural selection is irrelevant because the mutation has to come first. If we saw organisms teleporting, for example, you couldn't argue that the explanation is simply that there were a series of mutations that were naturally selected. 

The fact that we are aware of things like pain and fear only makes the unviability more pronounced and visible. The unviability holds, imo, also at the subconscious and instinctive levels as well.   

And without an actual will to live and and an actual drive to reproduce with an attractive mate, natural selection seems completely implausible and becomes akin to the infinite monkey theorem, only with infinitely less time and orders of magnitude more complexity to account for.

Without subjectivity (including instincts) an organism can have no goals because goals always aim to achieve something that that is beneficial, and something can be beneficial only from a subjective perspective. 

Without goals there can be no drive or will. The drive to reproduce and the will to live seemingly cannot be driven by the forces of physics. Magnets don't have drive or will and neither do self driving cars. They follow rules. 

If humans didn't supply AIs with goals, for example, then they wouldn't learn or do anything. You can't code subjectivity and subjective experience, which includes things like fear, pain and desire. Neither in software nor DNA. That's why AI will never be conscious and that's why physics and chemistry will never be able to explain how a flurry of neural activity alone yields subjective assessments or feelings (imo, of course).

It should be noted that these assertions are easily falsifiable. All one needs to do is get inanimate matter to act subjectively, either in a lab or on a computer. There's a difference between ""we don't know yet"" and significant sustained effort that hasn't yielded any progress at all in this regard, both in the lab and in AI.

**The correlation of material processes with subjective behavior and experience.**

Below I'll briefly explain why the necessity of material processes for realizing subjective behavior and experience is coherent and even expected if one presumes consciousness is fundamental.

Subjectivity is primarily an attitude towards things and events. A purely subjective function is essentially a scanner that elicits subjective meaning from what it scans. A consciousness that exists inside a body can only evaluate the state of itself and its environment on the basis of information that exists outside itself but inside its body, since that's the only thing it has access to.

As such, It requires some physical apparatus through which it can actually evaluate and influence its environment. A more complex apparatus allows for evaluation and expression at greater levels of resolution and depth. A good analogy might be comparing the experience of playing modern video games with the experience of playing the earliest most primitive video games.

Although there are obvious differences, this example illustrates why a more complex physical apparatus is necessary but not sufficient to produce a richer subjective conscious experience.

Primitive life had the minimum apparatus needed to get things going in a way that could evolve. And from there evolution and natural selection did the rest of the work.

In short, more physical complexity allows a consciousness embedded in a material body to better sense, evaluate, and act in a material world. This seems like a much more coherent explanation than presuming that neural complexity above a certain threshold is what causes subjective consciousness to emerge out of nothing."

""Whether you like it or not, the future of AI will not be canned genies controlled by a ""safety panel"". The future of AI is democratization. Every internet rando will run not just o1, but o8, o9 on their toaster laptop. It's the tide of history that we should surf on, not swim against. Might as well start preparing now.

DeepSeek just topped Chatbot Arena, my go-to vibe checker in the wild, and two other independent benchmarks that couldn't be hacked in advance (Artificial-Analysis, HLE).

Last year, there were serious discussions about limiting OSS models by some compute threshold. Turns out it was nothing but our Silicon Valley hubris. It's a humbling wake-up call to us all that open science has no boundary. We need to embrace it, one way or another.

Many tech folks are panicking about how much DeepSeek is able to show with so little compute budget. I see it differently - with a huge smile on my face. Why are we not happy to see *improvements* in the scaling law? DeepSeek is unequivocal proof that one can produce unit intelligence gain at 10x less cost, which means we shall get 10x more powerful AI with the compute we have today and are building tomorrow. Simple math! The AI timeline just got compressed.

Here's my 2025 New Year resolution for the community: 

No more AGI/ASI urban myth spreading.
No more fearmongering. 
Put our heads down and grind on code.
Open source, as much as you can.

Acceleration is the only way forward."""
"I recently succumbed to ragebait & wasted so much time and energy dealing with dumbness on the internet. I noticed the problem, then spent half the day problem-solving how to not get sucked into dumb things on the internet. Here are the solutions I found/came up with",DecidingToBeBetter,1i8z2yv,2025-01-24 11:16:09,25,0.87,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1i8z2yv/i_recently_succumbed_to_ragebait_wasted_so_much/,katxwoods,Sharing Helpful Tips,"**Publicly Commit to Avoid “Trigger Topics”**

Action: Identify specific topics that you find particularly enraging but not useful for your work or personal growth. Make a public or semi-public statement that you will refrain from posting or commenting on those issues.

How it helps: By drawing a clear boundary around your “no-go” subjects, you reduce the temptation to jump in. Publicly sharing that commitment adds accountability.

**Keep a “Reply-to-Self” Journal**

Action: When you feel like venting on a social thread, write it down in a private journal or note-taking app instead—but only as a last resort.

How it helps: Gets the frustration out of your system without fueling a public outrage cycle. Use this sparingly if you find it reinforces negative thought loops.

**Curate Your Feed Aggressively**

Action: Unfollow or mute people/hashtags/topics that frequently post content you find enraging or distracting. If someone mixes valuable insights with occasional outrage-bait, consider clicking hide/see less only on their triggering posts 

How it helps: You’ll see fewer triggers for heated arguments—while still keeping a connection to those who sometimes share useful information.

**Hide or Block Posts/Threads Proactively**

Action: As soon as you see a thread that riles you up, use the platform’s “Hide Post” or “Block Thread” feature if available.

How it helps: Removes the temptation to keep checking replies or re-reading enraging content.

**Set a Personal “No-Weigh-In” Trigger**

Action: Define a mental or written rule, for example, “If this topic is purely sensational or if it’s feeding on drama, I will not weigh in.” The moment you notice it hits that threshold, disengage.

How it helps: By labeling certain trending controversies as “no-weigh-in” zones, you spare yourself the aggravation and maintain focus on more meaningful discussions.

**Wait & Reflect Before Reading Comments**

Action: When you encounter a potentially heated post, wait until you’ve read or skimmed other unrelated content first. Then decide if you still want to see the comments. If you do, read them to observe, not necessarily to engage.

How it helps: Adds a buffer of distance. Often, the initial flare of outrage subsides, making you less tempted to argue.

**Adopt a “1 Comment” or “No Comment” Rule**

Action: If you feel compelled to respond, allow yourself only one comment. Avoid follow-ups and do not check replies.

How it helps: Short-circuits never-ending debates. You say your piece and then disengage.

**Practice the “Pause Before Reply” Technique**

Action: After you read something enraging, wait at least three minutes before writing a response. During those three minutes, keep scrolling or switch apps—do anything else. Then decide if it’s truly worth replying.

How it helps: A short pause often calms the urge to comment. You can more rationally decide if it’s worth the mental energy.

**Set Boundaries with Friends/Followers**

Action: Post or pin a statement on your profile such as: “I’m here to share my work and insights. I won’t be engaging in lengthy debates.”

How it helps: Lets your community know you’re deliberately avoiding arguments. You’ll feel less pressured to respond to provocations.

**Implement a “3 Good Posts” Rule**

Action: Before you close your social feed, find three positive or constructive posts and engage with them by liking, sharing, or commenting encouragingly.

How it helps: Rewires your usage toward seeking out positivity. Algorithms learn from your engagement, so liking and commenting on good content can shift what you see over time.

**Create a Pre-Written Exit Line**

Action: If you do get stuck in a discussion, have a polite, short “exit line” ready. For instance, “I’ve shared my perspective—thanks for reading. Signing off now!”

How it helps: Provides a swift, neutral closure that stops you from endlessly defending or explaining yourself.

**Celebrate Non-Engagement Wins**

Action: Track each day you successfully avoid an argument or inflammatory post. Reward yourself—whether it’s a small treat or just a mental high-five.

How it helps: Reinforces positive behavior, making you more likely to continue avoiding unproductive debates."
I use Aromasin because Anastrozole (Arimidex) is an ERα agonist and increases hippocampal E2.,Testosterone,1i8yr52,2025-01-24 11:02:29,16,0.84,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1i8yr52/i_use_aromasin_because_anastrozole_arimidex_is_an/,drankin2112,Other,"There are many anecdotes on the internet of people having worsening of anxiety, depression, and libido issues while taking Anastrozole, even when their E2 levels are in the normal range or above. I am one of those people and there are several reasons for this that I want to share. For the record, I do well on exemestane (Aromasin) because it lacks many of the mood and libido worsening effects that other AIs have on me. YMMV.

**ERα Receptor Agonism**

In 2020, there was an unexpected finding that in addition to its role as an aromatase inhibitor, Anastrozole is an ERα receptor agonist.

* **Study Finding:** Preclinical laboratory studies revealed that anastrozole (but not exemestane or letrozole) is a ligand for ERα. \[Link to study\](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/26/12/2986/265997/Anastrozole-has-an-Association-between-Degree-of).
* **Impact on Brain Function:** According to research, ERα is highly expressed in the brain. It plays a crucial role in mediating estrogen's effects on various brain functions, including cognition, mood, and neuroprotection. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) also plays a significant role in regulating sexual behavior and libido. When ERα is excessively activated, it can disrupt the balance of hormones and neurotransmitters involved in sexual function, potentially leading to a decrease in libido.

**Important Distinctions Between Aromatase Inhibitors**

The most important distinction between AIs is in the permanence of their effects on the aromatase enzyme. Non-steroidal inhibitors Anastrozole and Letrozole only bind temporarily (albeit strongly) to the enzyme, while the steroidal inhibitor exemestane's binding is permanent. So when using Anastrozole or Letrozole not only is the drug encountering and neutralizing aromatase enzymes as it reaches the target molecule, but simultaneously as the drug is being metabolized, previously bound aromatase enzymes are being liberated and reactivated in tissues. So the effect on circulating E2 is the net effect of these two ongoing processes. This liberation of aromatase that happens as the drug is metabolized may have unpredictable regional effects in the brain.

* **Study Findings:**
   * [Adverse Effects of Aromatase Inhibition on the Brain and Behavior in a Nonhuman Primate](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/5/918). Letrozole Treatment reduced peripheral levels of estradiol (E2) but *unexpectedly increased E2 levels in the hippocampus. Spatial working memory and intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurons were negatively affected.*
   * [Effect of aromatase inhibitors on learning and memory and modulation of hippocampal dickkopf-1 and sclerostin in female mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29128813/). Anastrozole and letrozole (but not exemestane) *impaired learning and memory*.

**Discussion**

Given the high number of anecdotes regarding Arimidex and ""estrogen rebound,"" combined with the knowledge that this rebound effect is apparently happening in the hippocampus even at steady state, it does make me wonder if the same estrogen-increasing phenomenon is happening in the prefrontal cortex and other cognition/behavioral critical brain structures when using non-steroidal AIs.

It's also important to remember that some people will not notice or be negatively effected by ERα agonism, increased E2 in the hippocampus, or even elevated E2 in general. How estrogen levels effect you is very personal and subject to all of your other genetics.

Using myself as an example, I know through genetic testing that I have several SNPs related to MAO-A and COMT. These genes effect the rate at which important neurotransmitters are neutralized and broken down within the brain. Without getting into a dissertation on what they are and what they imply, it's sufficient for the example to understand that I break down Serotonin and Norepinephrine very slowly and I break down Dopamine quite quickly. At least, these are my biological tendencies. But, they are not yours. It's one of the myriad of ways we are all different.

As a result my slow MAO-A gene (i have the slowest variant), I have a high baseline level of trait anxiety that other people may not have. Serotonin and norepinephrine accumulate and persist in my brain longer than average and it effects my emotions and behavior accordingly. And since I have this built-in tendency, I am extremely sensitive to anything that further suppresses MAO-A levels. Someone without this mutation may have a high tolerance to MAO-A modifying chemicals because they neutralize serotonin and norepinephrine relatively easily to begin with.

As it turns out, Estrogen is a potent MAO-A inhibitor. Thus, having high E2 levels makes it even harder for me to regulate the neurochemicals that are dependent on MAO-A availability. MAO-A is just one example of a gene that is effected by estrogen - there are many. Estrogen has profound epigenetic effects on all of the major neurotransmitter systems. Broadly, estrogen tends to enhance the effects of excitatory neurotransmitters through a variety of mechanisms.

As another example, it increases activity at the glutamate NMDA receptor, which is antagonized by Ketamine. It also increases Acetylcholine, because estrogen is an AchE inhibitor (so are Alzheimer's drugs as well as the world's most famous neurotoxins). Different people will be more or less effected by the cumulative effects of estrogen on their emotions and behavior. It is your collective genetics that dictate how you will respond to high and low estrogen levels, and how you will perceive the effects of E-modulating drugs.

For me, keeping my E2 levels in the low 20s using Aromasin is the only thing I've found that actually reduces my anxiety and keeps my mental chatter to a minimum. I'm not endorsing it and saying that everyone will respond the same because they won't. But what does effect everyone is the fact that the balance of sex hormones in your system profoundly effects the balance of neurotransmitters on your brain, either for better or for worse.

**About Me**

It is important to note that I am not on TRT. I am natural with normal TT levels, low normal FT, and high E levels. Since many of my symptoms mirror low T, I tried TRT for 2 years with little if any improvement in how I felt. The only AI that I tried during that time was Arimidex and it always made me feel terrible. I mistakenly thought that this was proof that I didn't need an AI, it turns out I was wrong.  Monotherapy with exemestane works well for me, while therapy with any non-steroidal AIs is a total disaster. They make all of my negative symptoms get worse. As a natty with an active HPGA, I have a very low risk of crushing my E2 with AIs.

* **Dosage:** I can use anywhere from 5-25 mg/day of exemestane, all with similar effects on E2 levels. At these doses, It's easy for me to maintain E2 levels in the low 20s. There seems to be a threshold where my levels don't go any lower. But remember, this is only because I'm not on testosterone. If I was, the dose would have to be much lower and less frequent.

**For Clarification on Dosage:**

Aromatase Inhibitors don't  block the conversion of T->E inside the testicles, which is where about 25% of a mans circulating E2 is derived from. The unaffected aromatase in the testes acts as a safeguard for men taking AIs because they are guaranteed to maintain a minimum level of E2 in circulation, regardless of the AI dose.

On the other hand, men taking exogenous testosterone have suppressed production of T (and therefore E) coming from the testes so there is no such safeguard against overdosing AIs. As a result, men on testosterone have to be very careful with the AI dosage because it's very easy to lower estrogen to near-zero without the continuous testicular production of estrogen happening in the background.

Good luck to anyone reading this. I'm sharing my experience just in case anyone can relate it to theirs and possibly be helped by it."

What to do after VO2max block,Velo,1i8y8ww,2025-01-24 10:40:43,1,0.53,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1i8y8ww/what_to_do_after_vo2max_block/,Comfortable-Emu-6274,,"I plan to do a VO2max block, doing block periodization. I will do 5 VO2 sessions next week followed by 1 VO2 sessions the following 3 weeks.

My question; what would you do after. The bigger goal is to raise my FTP. I don’t need base, so my plan is to take advantage of my higher VO2 (after that meso) and then try to push the FTP up. But how do I approach that? SST? Threshold sessions?"
