\[10th AMA of 2024\]

Pine\_apple 

Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for this month's AMA. For those that are in the United States, I hope you all had a really awesome Thanksgiving. November has been a very exciting month for crypto with more exposure for Bitcoin and especially eyes on utility projects like Hedera. We've seen HBAR with like 247% increase in price action in November alone. So very exciting times. Here at SaucerSwap, it has been a busy month and we're really excited to address your questions. So whether you're gearing up for the holidays or wrapping up the year, we hope you're in good spirits. So I'm joined today by ABFTFTW as my co-host. 

 

ABFTFTW 

Hey, thanks. Pine\_apple. Great to be here with everyone. As usual, we've got some fantastic questions lined up, touching on governance, ecosystem growth, marketing and more. So let's get started, Peter. 

 

Peter 

Hey everyone. Yeah. Thanks for joining us for this AMA. Today, I am here with Joseph to answer your questions from the week. Before we dive into those, we want to start with a quick status update on the project, specifically focusing on the roadmap moving forward.  

So over the past few months, we've noticed a common theme which is some uncertainty about the future vision of the project and that is actually completely understandable because our initial roadmap has essentially been completed. There are a few items that remain. Probably would be remiss not to mention Community Pools, but the major features have all been delivered. When you look at what's left, it might seem like feature creep or some disconnected updates that lack kind of a unifying theme or vision. We think that this is kind of one, the biggest problem right now for the project, but also the biggest opportunity. We're pretty positive about this one and optimistic.  

So to give you some insight behind the scenes, we've been working on a new vision for the project and we're kind of jokingly calling it internally the Renaissance of SaucerSwap. But in all seriousness, this will be a new multi-year roadmap that introduces substantial features to the project, and it's not just kind of small features like limit orders, although we do see a lot of value in that but, but really kind of more transformative large endeavors. So we are really excited about this. We're especially excited to share this vision because I think it's what we've kind of all needed for at least a few months now is a North star and I think a lack of that kind of manifested in a few ways. I think that a shared vision kind of energizes everybody. It keeps the community engaged. If you want to get involved, you can look towards that vision, that roadmap to create content, share posts, bring more people into the fold and I think we've lacked that for a few months. So I think that this updated roadmap will come from a solid foundation.  

Before when we had the initial roadmap, it was very speculative, but we have essentially delivered on all those items. We have delivered two interconnected versions of the protocol, SaucerSwap Version 1 and Version 2. We have a unique staking mechanism, a unique to Hedera governance architecture and some other essential features. And now we can publish a new roadmap with that foundation in place. So I think we're pretty set up for success here.  

Our plan is to publish this new multi-year roadmap by the New Year, so just in the next few weeks. We believe that this will spark some fresh excitement and new engagement in the community. So in the meantime, if you do have wish list items like limit order - as I know been a hot topic for the last few weeks. We've seen a few people posting in the general chat about that - or anything else that you would like to see on the roadmap, do let us know and we'll consider incorporating them into the road map. That's kind of the major story for today. We want to share a common vision moving forward for the next chapter of SaucerSwap's growth. So you can look forward to that coming out in the next few weeks. 

\_\_\_

Pine\_apple 

Thank you so much for that, Peter. A new North Star and a Renaissance of SaucerSwap 2025 is going to be really exciting. So let's get started with the Q&A. The first one is from Lounge Lizard. How does the SaucerSwap DAO ensure governance aligns with long term sustainability and decentralization while mitigating manipulation risks? 

 

Joseph 

Hey guys, great to be here. So yeah, governance has always been a cornerstone of SaucerSwap, and we've been very deliberate in creating a system that aligns with sustainability and decentralization while minimizing risks like manipulation. We largely draw our inspiration from Hedera and their path to decentralization in this regard. And also if we look at Uniswap, which our model is largely based on, it has been successful at avoiding like blatant manipulation, so that reinforces our design choice. And with the proper checks and balances, decentralized governance can thrive.  

Just to kind of break it down like our path to decentralization, we started with Proto governance that worked with the Planck Epoch \[Collectible\] NFTs, and it was largely off-chain and very permissioned, but it did establish the foundation for community like driven governance model. And in our current iteration, we've transitioned to a system that's based on the Hedera Consensus Service and uses token weighted voting in a more formalized framework.  

It's still largely restrictive in what can be done, but I guess as the protocol matures, it's natural that governance will also evolve, so future iterations will build on the strengths of our current framework and with the goal being more decentralization and automation where appropriate. It's also worth noting too that because we use the Hedera Consensus Service, we don't have to worry about self executing smart contracts, or handling like call data in proposals, so that limits like the risk in governance execution, compared to smart contract based governance frameworks like Uniswap. 

 \_\_\_

Pine\_apple 

All right. Thank you so much for that, Joseph. This next one is by Septia. Regarding the 2023 July 15 AMA: probably can't tell us who or what the project is, but is that project still under development? Are they still part of the Council? 

 

Peter 

Hey. Yeah. So I didn't go back to see what exactly was said in that AMA, but I think it's probably referring to LG and without giving too much information, I think they are still planning to use the SaucerSwap API and contracts for some product integration. And yeah, we're still really excited about it. I think it's just probably moving a bit slower than we had initially thought. But beyond, that we don't really have more information to share about that specifically right now. 

\_\_\_ 

ABFTFTW 

As we all know, big corporates roll slow. Alright, moving on with the Q&A, Anock asks when will SAUCE be listed on Binance or Coinbase? Would you consider working with the HBAR Foundation to facilitate the listing or on major exchanges? 

 

Peter 

Yeah, so for those large centralized exchange listings, like those formally Tier 1 centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, we have taken a collaborative approach, working with Hedera and HBAR Foundation leadership, we have filled out applications for both of those Centralized Exchanges. Just to manage expectations, we don't have a timeline for future listings on Centralized Exchanges. We don't want to put out messaging on this. I think it complicated some stuff in the past. So you know we're certainly open and value increasing visibility and accessibility. And again, we have filled out applications for those for those exchanges.  

Right now, we are more interested in focusing on the next phase of development for the project. Like I mentioned before, you know this updated roadmap.  We think that building real value is actually the best way to get listed on the leading Centralized Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, so that's our focus.  

I will also mention that there have been a couple of Centralized Exchanges that have just listed SaucerSwap of their own volition. I think if I'm not mistaken was CoinEx and then that Indonesian at Triv I believe is the name recently, so I think that's testament to this idea that, you know, focusing on developing the best protocol is kind of the best way to pursue these Centralized Exchange listings. 

 \_\_\_

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for that, Peter. This next question is from Lounge Lizard. How close are we to more bridges coming online and how does the team plan to engage with the wider crypto ecosystem once they are available? Chris V has a similar question. Is there a plan to incorporate a bridge to facilitate interoperability between chains? Are you also evaluating the possibility of expanding SaucerSwap to other chains? 

 

Peter 

Yeah. The last timeline communicated to us from the Axelar team and the HBAR foundation is the end of year or beginning of 2025 for a full mainnet integration of Axelar. And the bridge that is powered by Axelar is Squid router. So Axelar's kind of like the communication protocol. Squid is the bridge. On our end, we have fully integrated Squid in our dev environment on the bridge page. So that's kind of the front end bridge integration item. We will be able to go live with that bridge page, as soon as Axelar goes live on mainnet.  

We are similarly prepared to take pretty much the same approach regarding UX with any additional bridges like Layer 0. The idea is to just make it very easy to bridge directly on the SaucerSwap and capture the liquidity there.  

Regarding how to engage with the wider crypto ecosystem, we're basically following the strategy as defined by the HBAR Foundation, which is to focus narrowly on USDC when the bridge first goes live. So when Squid first goes live, our understanding is that the kind of only token that you can bridge via the interface will be USDC and it will come across as Hedera native USDC importantly. And then we'll track that liquidity of Hedera native USDC growing as the single KPI. And after that, we can broaden objectives, target more tokens such as some blue chip tokens like wrapped Bitcoin, wrapped ETH. So from our perspective, we're working with the HBAR Foundation and Axelar to optimize for those targets in the order that the HBAR Foundation sees at best, at least initially.  

So after that initial phase is completed, I think there will be more latitude in decision making. We can incentivize more unique token pairs and that will be up to governance to kind of let the market decide how how we want liquidity to come across. I think 1 area of interest in particular is RWA tokens and Axelar has an interesting kind of system that is a permissionless way to add tokens to their bridge. So right now with Hashport, it kind of goes through maybe a slower and less efficient process. With Squid router, it's permissionless, so we can expect a wide variety of tokens to be coming across to and from Hedera. 

\_\_\_ 

Pine\_apple 

Teamwork makes the dream work. Awesome sauce. Peter, so this next question is from SmuggMugler. RWAs and SaucerSwap can/will it be a thing? 

 

Joseph 

Yeah, good question. So RWAs are already beginning to take shape within this like SaucerSwap ecosystem. It's admittedly still its infancy, and that's largely because it depends on regulatory clarity. A current example is Diamond Standard, so this is tokenization of diamonds into the CARAT token, and that represents fractional ownership of Diamond backed NFTs. So you can trade that or provide liquidity on SaucerSwap V1 and V2. And Hedera in general, as we know is by virtue of its like scalable tech, strategic approach to regulatory compliance and developer infrastructure like the Stablecoin studio, and I think more recently, the RWA studio, make it uniquely suited for fostering tokenization of RWAs. And these initiatives provide that foundation for scaling RWA integration on SaucerSwap and exploring the types of assets that our protocol supports.   

So, we're pretty optimistic what the evolving sort of political and regulatory environment in the US under like this new administration. And now there's been changes in SEC leadership. This will result in clearer guidance and it will further the adoption of RWA is on Hedera and SaucerSwap. Pretty optimistic and we are just going to continue our conversations with established projects, new partners and Hedera leadership and provide updates as they become available. 

\_\_\_ 

ABFTFTW 

It's all fantastic news. I really like what I'm hearing there, Joseph. All right from Septia. Can the team talk about the delays of Epoch 26 LARI rewards? Will the team be able to scale to keep the time to distribute rewards under 24 hours? 

 

Peter 

Yeah. So sorry for the delay on that one there. There was a delay due to two things. So one, there was just an increase in the data. There was more liquidity providers, more deposit and withdrawal events into V2 pools or I should say minting and supplying and withdrawing liquidity. So that was kind of one factor.  

The other one was we just had an issue with one of the scripts that calculates forward. We have fixed that issue with the script, so we shouldn't have that particular issue again and our back end engineer Nathan has been working to optimize the reward calculation code to make delays less likely moving forward. We should be able to kind of scale with the growing data. We should be able to match that better, so it shouldn't happen again.  

We do apologize for any delays and just know that we are working around the clock when that does happen to get the rewards sent out as soon as possible. 

\_\_\_ 

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for that, Peter. This next question is from Chris V. Is the team considering developing a futures platform? And a semi related question from H. Barb. When will Planck Epoch \[Collectibles\] NFTs be activated to improve staking performance? 

 

Joseph 

Yeah. So, we are not considering a futures platform at the moment, but I guess regarding Planck Epoch \[Collectibles\] NFTs, how we prioritize Phases 2 and 3 of Single Sided Staking is going to reflect the broader roadmap and direction of SaucerSwap that Peter alluded to. So I mean addressing these features specifically, they seek to bridge the gap between project incubation, access to funding mechanisms, and then subsequent integration into the DeFi ecosystem where SaucerSwap serves as like the core liquidity layer and access to incentives.  

So moving forward, these systemic changes we're introducing will streamline this development effort and ensure that delivering high priority features like this at the forefront of our road map. And when it comes to our future direction in general, we're going to be laser focused on addressing the gaps in Hedera's DeFi ecosystem. So that includes streamlining user experience, expanding cross-chain liquidity as we mentioned, and among other things, like fostering developer adoption through tools and integrations. We think these foundational efforts will solidify SaucerSwap as the entry point for new users and developers. We can't detail everything right now, but we're pretty optimistic and we were very eager to communicate this soon. 

 \_\_\_

ABFTFTW 

Good stuff. All right from Teywanworth Larry. How SaucerSwap's making sure LP stack their bread, but ain't wildin' by giving too much to weak or risky pools? Joseph, I think this one's for you. It's got your name all over it. 

 

Joseph 

Yeah. So I can't match the language thing, but so the process of directing LARI Rewards to pools, it's designed to be self regulating through governance - so this is like feedback and proposals from LP's and token holders - help to ensure the rewards are allocated to pools to provide the most value while avoiding over incentivization of weaker one or like riskier ones. That said, us as Core Maintainers can take a more proactive role in the DAO, and this is just through proposing and voting on changes based on our insights into the protocol. So we would just be working within the same governance framework as everyone else in that regard. 

\_\_\_ 

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for that, Joseph. This next question is also for you and it's from H. Barb. Can the team talk about the interface fee and how it compares to other DEXs? 

 

Joseph 

Sure. So the interface fee generally aligns with that of Uniswap labs. So, that's both in terms of the structure and also the pools and tokens it applies to, we arrived at this fee structured based on sort of internal financial projections that ensured continued development of the protocol and our interface, regardless of market conditions or token runways. And importantly, because we do have multiple revenue streams, we retain flexibility to adjust the interface fee as needed, so we can adapt to changing circumstances. So yeah, for us, it's just ensuring sustainability so that we can support the platform, while remaining competitive in the evolving DeFi landscape. 

\_\_\_ 

ABFTFTW 

All right. Next question is for Peter from Maurice. What are your marketing plans to reignite interest in SAUCE and SaucerSwap?  

What, people lost interest? I don't think so Maurice. Anyway - 

 

Peter 

Yeah, this has been a kind of hot topic internally with the updated road map. So as the marketing lead for SaucerSwap, I do have a lot of thoughts on this topic. My answer is simple. It all comes down to a shared vision, which is kind of the theme of this AMA. So without a vision, marketing kind of falls apart. Marketing should articulate - it's kind of like directing a film. It articulates a story. Marketing articulates a product vision and that's what I meant in the intro about uncertainty. I don't think there's uncertainty in SaucerSwap itself at all. I think we've firmly established our market position. I mean, the numbers speak for themselves. We have over 90% market dominance on Hedera, but uncertainty does, I think, exist about what's next for Hedera DeFi and SaucerSwap. 

When there is not a shared vision, people don't know what to post about. The content has to be a bit forced. The community feels maybe directionless. There are posts, but there's not really that North Star, and it's hard to maintain excitement. And it's like the saying a fish rots from the head down. So I think the kind of top of the pyramid is that vision. And that's kind of our marketing philosophy is reestablishing that vision.  

I think we had a very clear vision when the project started with a roadmap. We've delivered on it. It's time to put out a new road map. That's why right now our top priority is publishing that clear multi-year roadmap to define the future of the project. Again, this is kind of a top down marketing approach. I believe it's the most effective, especially in this sort of environment like a Web3 community driven environment and you know people in the community who want to bring new eyes to SaucerSwap.  

There have been a number of people who have created support tickets asking how they can help and what we found is that they're all looking for that vision. They said what's next. We're looking at the roadmap. Is it like limit orders? What's the next thing? So you can only post so many times about how great Hedera is, or you know how SaucerSwap outperforms other DEXs. Do need kind of more of a shared dream to create engaging content. So that's the plan for reigniting interest.  

Just to not to beat this horse dead, but a shared vision of SaucerSwap's future through a roadmap. It will not only guide development and give us some clear landmarks to look forward to and track our progress, but also reignite community excitement, engagement and we do intend to publish that by the New Year. 

\_\_\_ 

Pine\_apple 

Thank you so much for that, Peter. I think this one is also for you too. And it's a suggestion to get Chris V a marketing engagement role. His post gets fantastic engagement with great videos and graphics. This is from a anonymous user I think. Or is it from Chris V himself?  Regardless, this question is for you. 

 

Peter 

Yeah, Chris has been fantastic. He is actually one of those users who created a support ticket to discuss his ideas with the SaucerSwap Labs team. So shout out to Chris. Thanks for the support. For anyone else interested, you know, we are always happy to hear your ideas about increasing engagement and visibility. If your initiative is sound and compliant, we're open to supporting it. So don't hesitate to reach out. We'd love to see if it's a good fit, but I think that there's kind of only so much we can support.  

If everyone in the community reached out and created a support ticket, that'd be a bit difficult. That's why we do have initiatives like the Dog Star campaign that will be awarded actually at the end of this AMA as usual. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, we award SAUCE tokens to community members who are highly engaged and helpful. Before every one of these AMAs, we have a little session in our social managers channel where we will view some posts from the last month on Twitter and Discord and helpful users in the general channel, etcetera and kind of decide who deserves it for this month.  

So if you are looking for a way to get involved, possibly earn some SAUCE tokens, that's a great place to start. Super easy. To do that one, there's no form to fill out or anything, just you know, post about SaucerSwap, help users and you could win some SAUCE.

ABFTFTW 

You know, shout out to NariYoshi for coming up with such a wonderful name for such a wonderful award. Miss you bud, come back. All right. Next question from H. Barb. When are you doing an interview with the HBAR bull? 

 

Peter 

Yeah, I think an interview with the HBAR Bull right after publishing the new roadmap would be perfectly timed. 

\_\_\_ 

Pine\_apple 

Awesome. Can't wait. This next one is also by H. Barb. I think this was for Peter. Any updates with the Hashgraph DeFi Alliance? 

 

Peter 

Yes, the Hashgraph DeFi Alliance has been buzzing with activity recently, so a few things. We've onboarded some new members. Bonzo Finance is now attending the calls and Elaine from the HBAR Foundation has joined the last few meetings to strategize around USDC. As I mentioned before, Axelar bridge coming online, possibly in the next month here, or at least in the early New Year. And some other bridges coming online like Layer 0. So she's been for the last two or three meetings, giving presentations and strategizing and giving us some Intel. So that has been really good, actually.  

We're also collaborating on an onboarding page to make it as easy as possible to onboard new users to join the Hedera DeFi ecosystem. You can kind of think of it like a just like a one page - I know Hashpack has like their DApp page and that's excellent. This would be something that is just like an easily shareable link and it just has some call to actions for users. You know, create a wallet or import your Metamask, stuff like that. So that is another initiative at the Hashgragh DeFi Alliance.  

 \_\_\_

ABFTFTW 

Awesome stuff to hear, Peter. All right, next question is from Badger. Just want to say the post on X have been great and I've started to see more videos from influencers on YouTube. Keep it up. Thanks for the effort. Go Saucer team. 

 

Peter 

Hey, thanks. Yeah, it's kind of rare to hear positive feedback on marketing just in general. But yeah, with the release of the new roadmap, we will be doubling down on marketing efforts. Again, I think it unlocks a lot of kind of downstream, more tactical marketing activities that we can do. We'll have kind of that top down strategy. So anyway, you can expect more frequent posts moving forward after we have that new roadmap published. 

\_\_\_ 

ABFTFTW 

All right, moving on. Next question is from Leonardo. Karate Combat approved a proposal for SaucerSwap incentives for KARATE. When will this be implemented on SaucerSwap? Thanks. 

 

Joseph 

So assuming that the request for comment conditions have been met, the next step it would be to formalize the revised RFC as a proposal, and you do this through the SaucerSwap interface. After this, users will get to cast their vote on both the proposal and the subsequent election, using their SAUCE and xSAUCE, and this process is well documented in the official docs and the pinned post in Discord.

Pine\_apple 

Already moving along, this next one is from Celestial Being. Happy holidays, thanksgiving, a merry Christmas when it comes. What is one thing each member of the team is looking forward to in the New Year? 

I guess I can go ahead and start this off for myself. Personally, I'm really excited about the next evolution of SaucerSwap and how it will bring significant impact and improvement to Hedera's retail ecosystem. And alongside that I'm kind of obviously looking forward to the bull run. 



ABFTFTW 

Yeah, way to steal my thunder there Pine\_apple. Yeah, I'm looking for a bull run there. Alright, Peter. 

 

Peter 

Yeah, Pine\_apple kind of stole my answer too. Jeez. Yeah. No, I was just gonna say I'm excited to unlock the next phase of growth for SaucerSwap. We are perfectly positioned to tackle the market in 2025 and scale SaucerSwap to new heights. So internally, we're locked in, we're determined to make 2025 a standout year and personally I just can't wait to get started. 

 

Joseph 

Yeah. And I guess in true SaucerSwap fashion, I'm gonna steal Peter's answer. So yeah, now we are very closely aligned as  you mentioned, which is going to make executing this vision much easier. So we're looking forward to that. 

\_\_\_ 

ABFTFTW 

That's something you can always expect from the SaucerSwap team during AMA is just massive creativity on our answers from the community, so you're welcome. Alright, well, this is about to wrap it up. Thanks to everyone who tuned in today. It is always great to connect with the community and hear your questions. And Pine\_apple. What you've got for us? 

 

Pine\_apple 

Lol Thanks ABFTFW. So thank you guys for all the amazing questions and continued support. We really wouldn't be here without you all and your commitment to SaucerSwap and the Hedera ecosystem. This AMA was packed with really good questions. Great discussion and it's really exciting to see the community so engaged across all different channels of social media from X to Calaxy and to our very own general Discord. And before we sign off, the team would like to award a Dog Star award to a community member that has been helping promote Hedera and SaucerSwap on X. There were really great candidates. We can reconvene next time, but for this month, congratulations to Dollar Cost Savage. Thank you for your support and please submit a support ticket to claim your Dog Star award. So congratulations. Thank you all for joining in today and we'll see you back here next month in December. Happy holidays. 

 

Peter 

Thank you, everyone. See you on the next one and happy holidays. "
Osmosis Alloyed Assets: Improving Liquidity Fragmentation & DeFi UX,cryptocrewvalidators,1h190dq,2024-11-27 11:58:21,5,0.86,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocrewvalidators/comments/1h190dq/osmosis_alloyed_assets_improving_liquidity/,crypto-crew,,"https://preview.redd.it/ds5vj45f5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c4394551f05631e154908a88a0ed3de56149ace

The contributors to [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/) have a long history of pushing the limits of what is possible on a decentralized exchange. Since their launch in 2021, they have continuously improved user experience and added functionalities that allow them to compete with their centralized counterparts. Their latest innovation is **alloyed assets** and with a relatively soft launch, many people may have missed how important this new feature is, both for user experience and for safety. In this article, after setting a little bit of context, I’m going to

* Introduce alloyed assets
* Show you how they work
* Explain why they are necessary

Let’s dive in.

# Context: Idiosyncratic Risks

When a person purchases stock of a single company, they take on two types of risk. **Systematic risk** is the set of all things that could wrong and affect every business, while **idiosyncratic risk** is the set of things that could go wrong with that particular company. Idiosyncratic risks include

* Poor resource management
* Regulatory changes
* Product or service failures

And all sorts of other issues, large and small. The problem is that average retailer investors (and also many above-average institutional investors…) are not good at measuring these idiosyncratic risks. This leads to the construction of investment theses which are missing critical information, costing people time, energy, and capital.

This is why **index funds** are so important. An index is essentially a basket containing many different stocks across many different industries, and their respective funds allow people to invest in the entire basket, hedging against idiosyncratic risks. After all, a disaster for one company might be an opportunity for several others. If you own them all, your portfolio is much safer. While not the first of its kind, [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal) launched an investment revolution with its first public index fund in 1976.

Ok, so what does this have to do with Osmosis?

# Bridges

The Cosmos was designed with blockchain interoperability at its center, facilitated by the **inter-blockchain communication protocol** ([IBC](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/)). This has far reaching consequences for its design space, but for normal users it means that assets can flow back and forth between blockchains seamlessly, safely, and permissionlessly. This has not been replicated in other ecosystems (yet…), so in order to service many important blockchain assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc), Osmosis relies on **bridges**.

A bridge is a piece of software that lets you move an asset from an origin chain to a destination chain. If I want to use some of my Bitcoin in an Ethereum smart contract for example, I need some way of representing my Bitcoin on the Ethereum chain, since it does not exist there natively. We won’t worry about too many details for now but there is one critical concept we will need.

# Bridges are Hard

Using cryptocurrencies has always been a bit risky, but ever since their popularity began to rise in 2021, bridges have become a prime target for hackers. A few bridge incidents of note:

* [Poly network bridge was hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_Network_exploit) for $600 million (August 2021)
* [The Wormhole bridge was hacked](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana) for $325 million (February 2022)
* [The Ronin bridge was hacked](https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/) for $540 million (April 2022 )
* [The Nomad bridge was hacked](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/nomad-bridge-drained-of-nearly-200-million-in-exploit/) for $190 million (August 2022)

The Nomad hack is of particular interest because just months prior, they had been nominated to be the canonical bridge from Ethereum to Osmosis alongside Gravity Bridge, Wormhole (hacked earlier that year) and [Axelar](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/206) which actually won the title.

Much like stocks, bridges also have idiosyncratic risks that are challenging for even sophisticated blockchain users to gauge. Despite that, these hacks also highlight that the demand for cross-chain interactions is only growing.

If only there was some way to hedge against these risks…

# Alloyed Assets

Osmosis’ solution to the potential perils of non-IBC bridges is [alloyed assets](https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/alloyed-assets-on-osmosis-unifying-ux-and-solving-liquidity-fragmentation/2624) – a way of indexing across multiple bridges for like-kind assets. To illustrate how they work, I’ll use an example scenario: A user wants to sell their BTC, which is currently on the Bitcoin blockchain, on Osmosis. In order to do so, they must bridge the BTC tokens over.

# Deposit

Because of the structure of blockchains, like-assets that arrive from different bridges are not **fungible** – that is, they are not recognized by the protocols as being the same token. In the past, a user would need to contend with complicated naming schemes:

* WBTC is Cosmos-native Wrapped Bitcoin from [Bitgo](https://www.bitgo.com/)
* WBTC.eth.axl is the Ethereum-native version, bridged via Axelar
* nBTC is bridged using [Nomic](https://www.nomic.io/)
* Etc etc etc

Each one of these representations is a separate token with separate liquidity pools, but all fundamentally represent the same asset. The nomenclature makes for a confusing experience for users and the fracturing of liquidity makes for a much worse experience for traders. More importantly, each one of these assets is tied directly to the idiosyncratic risks of its particular bridge.

Let’s return to our user wishing to move their BTC to Osmosis. There are two possibilities for such a user: (1) They have no idea what bridges exist or which one to use or (2) They have a bridge in mind they want to use.

If we search BTC on the Portfolio page, we can see that Osmosis has made some very deliberate choices:

https://preview.redd.it/9n5jvoxk5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78f48f9b65f779114feeb3379bfcdc8859882042

First, we can see all the ugly BTC versions that are bridge dependent, but the simplest version appears at the top. This is a perfect choice for users who neither know nor care about how their tokens arrive. When they click deposit, they are presented with a screen like so:

https://preview.redd.it/ega2t7vq5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c6617fedcc6294562b1a29bb203867845e7f54d

Users who wish to receive a particular version of BTC can simply select one they want from the dropdown, but most users will probably review this screen and continue to sign the transaction which will forward their BTC through an automatically selected bridge to Osmosis. Once the transaction has been confirmed on the source blockchain and in the bridge, their BTC will be visible in their Osmosis account. Easy.

But wait… what even IS this BTC token?

This is alloyed Bitcoin. It is a tokenized mixture of several BTC variants that exist on Osmosis. You can think of it like a basket of different bridged versions of BTC, much like an index fund is a basket of stocks.

To understand how this token comes to be, we need to look at **liquidity pools**.

# How to Make an Alloyed Asset

Alloyed assets are actually just liquidity provider (LP) tokens for special **transmuter** liquidity pools. Let’s break that down a bit.

First, I mentioned that each alloyed asset is like a basket, so somewhere we have pull together all of the different tokens that will contribute to it. This occurs in a special smart contract called a liquidity pool. A typical pool has two assets and will aim to store 50/50 dollar value of each. For example, if a BTC/USDC pool had $10k work of USDC, it would also need to hold $10k worth of BTC. These pools are how an **automated market maker** (AMM) like Osmosis automates its trading – users are not buying from or selling to one another directly, but from the liquidity pool.

Users can contribute funds to a liquidity pool to receive LP tokens. These tokens are like a proof-of-contribution and they can always be redeemed for some fraction of the pool’s contents. Typically, holders of LP tokens are entitled to some pro-rata share of the fees that the pool generates as traders exchange between its two assets.

https://preview.redd.it/hw1mdgnt5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cd680bdba788199ed09e6acee0ac239deef4180

The transmuter liquidity pools that power alloyed assets are not typical, but do behave in a similar way. For starters, these pools can have more than two assets in them, and the ratios of these assets are more flexible. All of them, however, need to be ‘like-kind’ – each is a different representation of the same original asset.

Just like a typical pool, users can deposit funds in the form of any one of the accepted representations, and in return they will receive LP tokens. But unlike in normal pools, this LP token is **scaled** such that for every one of the like-kind asset you deposit, you receive back one LP token. These LP tokens ARE the alloyed asset, representing a scaled share of the pool’s contents.

https://preview.redd.it/vwga1ofv5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ce868a9dd2c1167d697dde6433e6629432c6526

It is worth remembering that although this article is focussing on alloyed Bitcoin and its constituent representations, it is only an example. It is possible to create alloyed versions of Ethereum, stablecoins like USDT, and any other tokens in the same manner.

# Conclusion

In this article, we managed to cover the basics of what alloyed assets are and why they are important. Hopefully you now you understand that

* Bridges come with idiosyncratic risks that are hard to measure
* Alloyed assets allow users to hedge against these risks
* They do this by being composed of many bridged representations
* This cleans up the user experience and increases safety

Having started our own journey validating the Osmosis chain, we at CryptoCrew are thrilled at the incredible progress that the contributors have made continuously improving their product. They have cemented themselves as a pillar of the interchain, and are one of several shining examples of the appchain thesis in action. We look forward to many future developments which keep their users’ interests at heart, and will continue to contribute to their bold and exciting experiment.

Thanks for reading!

The Power of Kima Network Blockchain.,CryptoDose,1fziuma,2024-10-08 23:57:13,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoDose/comments/1fziuma/the_power_of_kima_network_blockchain/,BullishLFG,,"Kima is a blockchain that tackles the interoperability problems found in existing solutions without causing additional liquidity fragmentation. Kima addresses this problem by providing a simple, secure mechanism for allowing users to perform cross-chain atomic swaps without token-wrapping.

The Kima blockchain is built using the Cosmos SDK, which provides a steadfast framework for developing a custom blockchain. The Kima blockchain uses committee-based consensus, where a “committee” is selected to produce blocks and run the consensus protocol. Each committee consists of a rotating set of “wardens” whose role is to ensure the asset pools remain in sync and withdrawals from a pool on the destination chain are only authorized when a corresponding deposit has been confirmed on the source chain. Kima wardens control the asset pools through the use of Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS). Security is strengthened by running the wardens inside a Trusted Execution Environment. The group wardens and the parameters of the Kima platform are controlled through the Kima blockchain.

https://preview.redd.it/3f289iy1mntd1.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aef4f991d1ea4d93531d1aae49fae73890c276c

To avoid creating synthetic (“wrapped”) tokens on each chain, Kima maintains liquidity pools on each integrated layer-1 blockchain (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon, Solana). The Kima protocol, run on the Kima blockchain, monitors and synchronizes assets across these layer-1 blockchains.

The Kima blockchain is both permissioned and permissionless. The permissioned layer includes  validators approved by Kima and known for their reliability - e.g. funds, banks, organizations, etc. The second layer of the Kima blockchain validators is permissionless, allowing anyone with enough (delegated) stake to become a block producer (and warden). The permissionless nature of the Kima blockchain means that the set of wardens will change regularly. 

The 2 layer consensus mechanism archives stability, security, and decentralisation.  

The Kima blockchain has four main goals:

1. To manage and update the set of wardens for the committee-based consensus.
2. To execute platform governance, e.g. choosing the blockchains and supported tokens, setting fees, etc.
3. To create an auditable record. Every cross-chain swap will be recorded on the Kima blockchain (and the underlying chains) to create a secure audit trail and provide accountability for the wardens.
4. To enable cross-chain messaging. As Kima moves beyond its initial deployment, it will enable users to perform more than just simple cross-chain atomic swaps. The Kima messaging platform will allow users to interact with contracts across multiple blockchains from a single, unified environment.

When users request cross-chain transfers, the warden committee is responsible for:

1. Recording the request on the Kima blockchain
2. Monitoring the source chain to ensure the deposit was received
3. Completing a threshold signature to release funds on the destination chain
4. Recording the finalized process on the Kima blockchain

The Kima consensus and the underlying threshold signature scheme provide an auditable record of the actions of the validators (committee of wardens). Thus, if a committee member misbehaves during the consensus protocol or the threshold signature scheme, there is evidence of this misbehavior. This can be presented as proof and used to slash the committee member’s stake.

This architecture has been proven in Cosmos SDK-built systems like Axelar and Thorchain. As in other Cosmos-based blockchains, a committee of validators is elected through stake-weighted voting. In addition to producing blocks on the Kima blockchain, the block producers are responsible for validating and recording events that happen on the connected chains. To do this, Kima block producers can run full nodes of each of the connected blockchains.

Exploring QuickSwap: A Comprehensive Review of the Leading Polygon-Based DEX. What Are Your Experiences and Thoughts on QuickSwap's User Interface and Features?,ethtrader,1dr4g4y,2024-06-29 02:00:59,12,0.84,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dr4g4y/exploring_quickswap_a_comprehensive_review_of_the/,kirtash93,Discussion,"# User Inferface and Navigation

QuickSwap’s user interface is simple, easy to use, and not confusing at all. Compared to other DEXs, it follows the same standard with the main box in the middle. Additionally, there are extra boxes with price and liquidity pool data on the left (which can be collapsed) and a news feed and email subscription box on the right (which can also be collapsed).

https://preview.redd.it/dl34ygu8ag9d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3ffc21ac3b575cdc01a3d3cd90860daf14fb9c

They allow for Market, Limit, and TWAP swaps, as well as Cross Chain swaps with a very customizable approach. Every step of making a transaction is straightforward and similar to other DEXs' UIs. They also allow buying crypto with a credit card.

# Supported Tokens and Chains

They mainly focus on the Polygon chain and refer to themselves as the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that’s fully decentralized and community-driven. They also allow trading any combination of ERC-20 tokens.

# Liquidity

QuickSwap offers the possibility to provide liquidity and earn a 0.25% fee on trades proportional to your share of the pool. You can also earn dQUICK by depositing LP tokens to earn extra rewards.

# Staking

They allow staking through their single staking pool for the QUICK token called Dragon's Lair. You can earn dQUICK and receive your share of 0.04% of all trading fees.

# GamingHub

They also have a GamingHub section where you can find a wide variety of games developed on Polygon chain that are FreeToPlay. I have never played any of those games but I think it worth looking into them. Maybe you find yourj favorite game there. As they say in the page, polygon games have low transaction fees, an strong ecosystem with Polygon studios support, liquidity support, etc.

# Personal Experience

Some time ago, I used QuickSwap to buy CONE with a credit card, and the process was easy and fast. The fees were obviously higher than using crypto directly, as is typical when using a credit card in other apps, but it wasn't unreasonable. Recently, I made a small trade from MATIC to WETH, and everything was smooth and fast. The fees in this case were approximately €0.01, so very cheap.

In general, I think QuickSwap is a really interesting Polygon-based DEX that allows you to move coins in and out of the Polygon chain with ease.

I hope you enjoyed this review!

\[6th AMA of 2024\]

Pine\_apple 

Thank you all for joining our monthly AMA today. Next week is Father's Day here in the United States. So happy Father's Day to all the dads out there. ABFT is co-hosting today and we have two awesome guests in the house, Brady and Gaurang. Both are co-founders of Bonzo Finance, an open source, non custodial lending and borrowing protocol built on the Hedera network. So welcome to our AMA, Brady and Gaurang. 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Hey, thanks so much for having us. Really appreciate it and excited to get the chance to chat with the SaucerSwap community. 

Gaurang (Bonzo Finance) 

Glad to be here.  

ABFTFTW 

Hey Brady. Hey Gaurang. Good to have you guys in the Bonzo Finance in the house. Happy to have you with us. I've been outside today and it's in Texas and it's a scorcher. I'm hoping some of that heat kind of passes off into the cryptosphere. I think the HBAR has a bright future. You know that most development going on in all the crypto space and I'm in it for the tech, so let's get this going. Talk to me, Peter. 

Peter 

Hi everyone. Welcome to our June AMA. And a very warm welcome to Brady and Gaurang from Bonzo, who will be answering some questions about their upcoming lending protocol. So super excited to welcome them up here to talk about that. So in the past, some of you may know, we've welcomed guests from projects like HeadStarter and Citadel wallet, so we are always excited to bring on builders in this space to talk about what they're building on Hedera.  

Before we do jump into the questions from this week, we want to take a moment to address just the overall sentiment and roadmap. We wanna give everyone a sense of what's currently being worked on, what's coming next and our overall strategy to grow SaucerSwap.  

So first of all, we have made some great progress on governance, which will provide a core utility to the SAUCE token. So for those unaware, governance is the core and sometimes exclusive utility of many DEX tokens. This includes UNI of Uniswap. With the release of governance, everyone will be able to vote with their SAUCE on proposals that align initiatives, create farms and LARI campaigns, decide token classifications, and so on and so forth. We have governance working now on Testnet and have created the UI for it. So we are looking at launching it early summer. So in the next few weeks. It could be towards the end of this month or it could go into next month but it is coming up.  

Next we get to work on some features after governance that we know have been highly anticipated, namely Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Single-sided staking. We are super excited to follow through with these developments. We know that they've been a long time coming and they can contribute to some greater utility, both for the xSAUCE token and then also the Planck Epoch Collectible NFTs via kind of their redemption for Sauceling NFTs. So after we roll out governance, we'll be able to lock in the product schema for these features and move forward with their development. So we are really excited about bringing Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Single-sided staking online.  

Additionally, with SAUCE having been listed on Bitget last month, we are looking forward to at least one more Centralized Exchange listing this month, with two being more likely. There is additionally a Centralized Exchange listing that is currently scheduled for July, which we are excited about as well.  

We also want to just quickly bring to your attention we kicked off a major grant with the HBAR Foundation last week, providing over 20 Million HBAR in incentives for liquidity providers. At the time of receipt, that was over $2,000,000 USD an equivalent value for those tokens and those tokens are being distributed right now to SaucerSwap liquidity providers, in both Version 1 and Version 2, and we'll be live for the next few months. So if you haven't had a chance to check that out, feel free to do so on [Saucerswap.finance](http://Saucerswap.finance) on the liquidity page. You'll see kind of the effect of those increased rewards.

The salient point we do want to make in this introduction is we understand sentiment is lower today than it was a few months ago. We think this is kind of observed across DeFi on various networks, but you know the nature of these things is cyclical and we want our users to know that we are still developing, we're shipping major features coming up with governance and more on the roadmap that I just mentioned, as well as some other integrations in the coming weeks.  

Looking back at the previous month, we think we had some major wins. You know we had this grant announcement with 20 Million HBAR, a major listing on Bitget, a MoonPay integration that's been in the works for a few weeks, not to mention the work that we have accomplished behind the scenes. So there's a lot to be excited about moving forward and we are very appreciative of all of your support as we continue to grow SaucerSwap.  

I will just mention as well, you know the project depends on our community as much as it depends on development. So I would like to encourage everyone to stay positive. There's a lot to look forward to. We're working hard and remember that we have a well defined roadmap and we've consistently shipped features on that roadmap since the launch of SaucerSwap Version 1 almost two years ago, and we have a clear plan going forward as well to scale.  

As we scale, the ecosystem has some exciting developments as well. So this is kind of the the feature of this AMA. We have Bonzo here, so lending and borrowing going live. It's a DeFi primitive that has an established symbiotic relationship with DEXs on other networks. It's a proven model, so we're excited to see projects like Bonzo and others coming online soon. There's a few lending and borrowing. I think HLiquity, it's already live. They created a pool on SaucerSwap. Bonzo is coming right up as well. And I think Sirio is another one. But anyway, all of these developments can bring a lot more awareness and activity to Hedera DeFi.

So with that preamble out of the way, we can get into the questions for this week.

Pine\_apple 

Thank you so much, Peter. Hedera DeFi, here we come. So the first question is from Rocco. With this environment being highly competitive, any project is required to have excellent marketing in order to succeed, regardless of how its tech is. What is SaucerSwap's long term plan to gain popularity and create brand awareness, especially to people outside of the Hydra ecosystem? As of my observations, current incentives don't reach far out of Hedera or SaucerSwap's community. So, for example, onboarding influential social media figures to talk about SaucerSwap, purchasing ad space or other collaborations in order to reach people that aren't already in the Hedera ecosystem. As of now, the average crypto enthusiast does not know of SaucerSwap's existence. What are your thoughts on that, Peter? 

Peter 

Yeah, Rocco, thanks for the question. So this kind of goes back to our overall marketing approach. And in general, it's always been to be objective and honest about the development of the platform. Reading brand awareness is a tricky thing and our philosophy is that it's linked to earning brand integrity. In our view, this comes from following through and executing on development.  

So in Web3, you see a lot of marketing that focuses on hype and speculation, and in the short term that works. Our approach is different. We think that a long term, more sustainable approach that builds trust is better. It's not to say that we don't want visibility, especially to people outside the Hedera ecosystem. Quite the opposite. That's one of our main goals is to expand the challenge is accessibility. So right now there's one bridge to and from Hedera that not many people outside of Hedera know about. There is limited access to Hedera native USDC on Centralized Exchanges. The Hedera Token Service has not been integrated, full stop, on many Centralized Exchanges. These are substantial barriers to entry that that do make any marketing endeavors to users from other networks not impossible but definitely more challenging.  

The silver lining to all of that is that all of these problems are being actively addressed, and when they are addressed, I think it's reasonable to expect the door to Hedera to open and because it will be so much easier to get involved by having easier access to native USDC for example, or being able to use the bridge that users are familiar with and trust, they will have less friction to get involved with Hedera and participate in the various network offerings.  

So sum up our point of view, we think our marketing approach to date has been effective with a kind of high of reaching the top 25 DEXs across all networks by TVL, despite the accessibility challenges I mentioned before, and despite the lack of institutional capital on Hedera. So that is a massive achievement and we're not trying to rest on our laurels. I think it's just a good barometer of what we've achieved together. We surpassed Camelot, SpookySwap, QuickSwap, Bancor, Minswap - which is the leading DEX on Cardano - Loopring, and other very prominent DEXs, some of which had TVLs in excess of $1 billion last cycle.  

So this growth we observed was not achieved by hiring influencers to create urgency or sense of hype, but just by being consistent and working hard and delivering on our roadmap. That strategy has been successful for the growth of SaucerSwap to date and that is our strategy going forward.

ABFTFTW 

That was a great question Rocco, and Peter, you nailed it on the head. I couldn't agree more. Next question is for Bonzo Finance. Are there any plans to integrate SaucerSwap's API with Bonzo to enable collateral swaps directly from within the Bonzo Finance interface? 

Gaurang (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah. To the question the answer is absolutely yes, but not immediately. We might be doing that in Q3 of this year. So what we are focusing on right now, Bonzo has a public Testnet live right now, which has the basic features like borrowing, lending, repaying, withdrawing and all these things, right. And we also have flash loans working right now on the Testnet.  Our current main focus is to launch on the Hedera Mainnet with a basic set of features. These will include flash loans, liquidation bots, all the borrowing lending, you know, basic features of any lending protocol. Immediately after that, we want to launch the collateral swaps because our team has been using lending protocols personally and I think collateral swaps or even DEX swaps is a really nice feature, so if you see the APY for some token is more than the APY for the token that you have supplied, you can immediately switch that token without going through the whole process of withdrawing and supplying again. So yeah, it's definitely on the roadmap and that will be one of the first features that we tackle after launching on the Mainnet. 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, and just to add to that as well. Bonzo Finances, it's based on the Aave V2 code base and so the functionalities that you're seeing on Aave V2 are all part of the roadmap. And I think we're taking a similar approach to SaucerSwap when it comes to sort of laying a a really solid and robust foundation initially. They had started with Uniswap V2 and then evolved feature sets and product offerings and eventually adopted Uniswap V3, and we're taking a very similar approach and it's sort of phased, but we want to deliver a really solid and usable product right off the bat, utilizing Aave V2 and sort of its core functionalities.

Pine\_apple 

Great. Thank you so much for that Brady and Gaurang. The Bonzo testnet is found on [Bonzo.Finance](http://Bonzo.Finance), so for free to check that out guys. So our next question is from an anonymous user. When is SAUCE going to be listed on another Centralized Exchange? To get a ByBit listing, you need to have 40 million marketcap. SAUCE well past 50+ Million marketcap. Why is SAUCE not on ByBit? And another question is, did the team also apply for Binance after the recent announcement? What are your thoughts, Peter? 

Peter 

Yeah. Thanks for this question. So as I mentioned in the introduction to the AMA, we are planning for at least one Centralized Exchange listing this month, with two potentially being on the horizon. We can't speak on kind of specific exchanges or the exact scheduling right now, but we are satisfied with the progress we have been making and we're looking forward to the coming weeks.  

I will just also note that so newer projects like PACK from the HashPack team tend to get listed faster or percede the scheduling in terms of listing of other network tokens. Just being a newer project, this is kind of what Centralized Exchanges want to capitalize on, and it's great for the ecosystem. It's been really good for us and it means that HTS is integrated on exchanges. There's more precedent for it and some more token listings can follow. And we have been working with HashPack to achieve the goal for the, you know, to the benefit of the entire HTS ecosystem to have HTS more widely integrated on Centralized Exchanges. And that of course kind of culminated in the Bitget listing last month with PACK and SAUCE.

ABFTFTW 

Yeah, sounds good to me. Thanks for that explanation there, Peter. Septia. Hello, Septia. How are you? Septia wants to know what risk controls will Bonzo Finance have in place to minimize liquidity crunches. 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, it's a great question. Happy to take that one. So there's a few things that we're doing to try and minimize that risk. The first one, which is foundational to Aave, is that when you're participating in lending and borrowing, it is an overcollateralized position that you're providing. So when you supply assets to the protocol, you are only allowed to borrow a percentage of the value that is supplied and the percentage is different per asset. So based on risk parameters and a risk analysis for each asset that's supported, that over collateralization amount is going to change. Essentially the loan to value amount will change. So when users are sort of over collateralizing, there's a buffer that exists for those assets.  

And then in addition, dynamic interest rates. So the interest rates for borrowing adjust based on the utilization of that particular asset. So as more of an asset was borrowed, the interest rate for that asset increases and that incentivizes the behavior of repaying and also sort of encouraging liquidity to return to the protocol. Gaurang, anything else there that I may have missed? 

Gaurang (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah. So I just want to give an example of the Aave market on the Scroll network. The Scroll is another L2 on Etherium. It actually happened I think on Thursday or Friday this week. So on the Aave protocol, there's a concept called utilization rate. Essentially, it's a rate of borrowed assets against supplied assets. So let's say all the people on the on the network has supplied 10,000 USDC and all the people have borrowed 9,000 USDC. So in that case, the utilization rate is going to be 90%. So as Brady was saying, as the utilization rate goes on increasing, the interest rate goes very high. So on Scroll, what happened this week was that the USDC utilization rate was at 99%, and because of that, the borrow and the supply APY on that particular asset was very high. So it was going towards like 80% or something for the supply. And you know what happens is with the market dynamics whenever the APY goes so high, there are more people in the market for supplying that asset. So it's kind of like an equilibrium and it's a game theoretical problem. So what we have observed in the protocol in the past is that the market dynamics kind of help with this. That's number one.  

We are also looking at implementing something called Borrow Caps from Aave V3. We might bring in that functionality in \[our\] Aave V2 \[fork\] now. I'm not sure whether we will be doing it, but we are trying to do it before the Mainnet launch. With the Borrow Caps, we can actually cap the utilization of any assets, so we could cap it at let's say 90% or 85% or something. Yeah, these are like a couple of things that we're looking at. 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah. And then to add in addition to that, there is a mechanism within Aave that is also being employed in Bonzo called a safety module. Essentially, a safety module is a reserve of the protocols native asset. Holders of that native asset are incentivized to lock up their tokens into this safety module and receive a interest rate, an APY for doing so. That reserve can be employed in the case of a shortfall event related to liquidity. So if there's moments of extreme volatility for supported assets and liquidations that don't take place in a timely manner or take place improperly, that reserve is also employed to ensure that accreditors are made whole. So anticipation is that we are doing everything to mitigate the chance of that from happening, but it is sort of an insurance in the case of something like that taking place. And then if it is employed, the assets that are utilized from the safety module, it's shared across anybody who is participating in that functionality.

Pine\_apple 

Great. Thank you so much for that, Brady and Gaurang. So moving on to our next question, this is from a anonymous user. SaucerSwap Twitter is not very active recently and the number of followers is stagnating, which seems to indicate a lack of interest. Any plans to boost engagement, engagement and dynamism in the coming weeks? 

Peter 

Yeah, well, Bonzo's surely getting the fun questions. So SaucerSwap's Twitter account has grown by 3400 followers in the last 30 days, which indicates roughly a 10% increase month over month. That is an excellent growth rate. And over the next few weeks, we have several developments and integrations that we will announce and highlight right on our social media platforms, including Twitter. So in terms of recent growth, we have enjoyed a healthy rate of increase again 10% month over month is very good.  

Going back to the answer from before regarding our marketing approach, we use our social media accounts to put out useful information about integrations and protocol developments, so that all the content we put out is not just fluff. We want to put out substance. Additionally, the Spring Incentives Campaign does present a unique opportunity for marketing. Looking into potentially doing a press release for this one to kind of target users from other networks. So highlighting that as an endeavor is something we're currently pursuing.

ABFTFTW 

Sounds pretty good, Peter. Thank you for that. Next question is again for the Bonzo crew. Are there any integrations that will exist between SaucerSwap DEX and Bonzo Finance lending protocol? 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, we're definitely looking into integrations between the two. I think the first thing off the bat is there are two core functionalities within the Bonzo Finance ecosystem for liquidation bots and flash loans that Gaurang mentioned earlier. And so for liquidation bots, essentially what that is, is anybody in the ecosystem who is technically savvy can operate a liquidation bot that seeks out opportunities for liquidations. Essentially when liquidation thresholds are met for users. And upon performing the liquidation, they would take the collateral that was supplied by the user and swaps would need to be performed as part of that process. And when we are building out the templates for liquidation bots in that ecosystem, it is going to heavily rely on SaucerSwap and their DEX and the liquidity in SaucerSwap to perform that action.  

One thing I'm excited about that in the sense that I think that by adding lending protocols and particularly Bonzo Finance and our liquidation bot ecosystem, it should help further drive volumes that we see on the SaucerSwap DEX, which is a key health metric, and then in addition to that with flash loans.  

Flash loans are essentially the ability to borrow assets from the Bonzo Protocol without providing collateral. And the way that works is it's the development of a smart contract that borrows assets or liquidity from the protocol, utilizes that liquidity for certain types of financial transactions, so it could be arbitrage between two Decentralized Exchanges or between a Centralized and a Decentralized Exchange, and then paying back that loan plus interest, all within a single transaction. And if the loan is unable to be repaid back within that single transaction, the process reverses. And so it's as if that process never happens. So flash loans are viewed as a very relatively safe way to be able to utilize larger amounts of liquidity in the protocol and earn a profit for doing so based on the various types of activities that would utilize that liquidity for in the templates that we're building out for our developer ecosystem. That includes SaucerSwap as sort of a key exchange that someone would utilize when participating in a flash loan type activities. Gaurang, anything else there to add in addition with regards to integrations? 

Gaurang (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah. So we mentioned the collateral swaps earlier, so that will be another integration. Also, we are heavily relying on the WHBAR, the wrapped HBAR contracts deployed by SaucerSwap. So for us, I think for any blockchain protocol, composability is very important, right? So it's very important to be able to work with essentially all the contracts and all the things that have already been deployed on the network. That's why we are integrating with the WHBAR contract deployed by SaucerSwap. That way, there's very close tie and close relationship between Bonzo and SaucerSwap. Anyone who is kind of building liquidation bots on Bonzo or utilizing the flash loans on Bonzo will be able to use SaucerSwap very seamlessly.

Pine\_apple 

Great. Thank you so much for that, Brady and Gaurang. So this next question is from a user and you guys kind of touched on this a little bit. For liquidation bots on Bonzo Finance, will there be mechanisms in place to utilize SaucerSwap's liquidity to facilitate the liquidation process efficiently? 

Gaurang (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, absolutely. So I would say it's like the keystone for any liquidation bots on Bonzo. So without SaucerSwap's liquidity, the liquidation bots and the flash loans won't really work. So just to kind of explain in short how the liquidations work, let's say I have deposited some token on Bonzo token like KARATE or DOVU or SAUCE token, and I have borrowed USDC against those tokens. Now let's say what happens is, just like what happened yesterday, the supply token value goes down by 20% because of some events in the market that happened yesterday for example.  Now what happens is in this case my loan to value ratio, my LTV, could go above the liquidation threshold and in this case, the liquidation bots will kick in. So what the liquidation bots will do is they will repay my USDC loan by taking a flash loan. They will swap my USDC on SaucerSwap back to SAUCE, and then they will essentially pay back the flash loan on Bonzo. So all these actions will happen in the same block, in the same transaction on the blockchain, not the same transaction, but the same block on the blockchain. And that's why without SaucerSwap, liquidation bots might not work unless you have like a big liquidity in your own wallet. Unless you have like 10s of thousands or even millions of dollars in your wallet, it won't work.

ABFTFTW 

Awesome, Gaurang. Thank you so much for that. Next question goes to Joseph, what cross chain activities will the team be participating in over the next six months to encourage new users to come to SaucerSwap? 

Joseph 

Hi everyone. Man, I feel like a second class citizen during this far down. Well yeah, to answer the question, there are several interoperability solutions currently integrating with Hedera. So I believe Axelar has been the first to publicly announce this, and once integrated, there will be more avenues to bridge assets to and from Hedera and other chains. So SaucerSwap plans on leveraging this by allocating a portion of the 23 Million+ HBAR in THF grant money towards liquidity incentives in both V1 and V2 pools. And this would be pools containing these newly supported cross-chain assets, with an emphasis on stable coins.  

On protocols like Axelar will also enable cross-chain swaps in addition to the standard bridge transactions, and this means you can access say Uniswap liquidity from within the SaucerSwap's web frontend.  

Beyond this, we are continuing to assist with the onboarding of new active liquidity management or ALM providers such as Gamma and Steer protocol. These offer an alternative liquidity management strategy to Ichi. So ALMs, of course, are important for the health of SaucerSwap for V2 since concentrated liquidity positions can be a challenge to manage without the auto rebalancing.   And lastly, I think it would be great for multi-chain yield aggregators like Beefy to integrate with Hedera. This would enable V1 yield farmers and potentially V2 liquidity providers to automatically compound their earnings without the need to do like a manual harvest. 



\_\_\_



Pine\_apple 

Great. Thanks so much for that. Joseph, you're A1 in my book friend. So the next question is from anonymous user. Development seems relatively slow recently. Are you facing particular challenges such as technical staffing or other? When can we expect the release of the features in development visible on the roadmap? For example, improved LARI analytics, slippage optimization, Wallet Connect integration, etc. 

Joseph 

Yeah, good question. So development is fairly cyclical, meaning we generally spend several months with our heads down working on a new product or feature. Then once it's ready to ship, we allocate more resources to marketing and just become more public facing in general. So you may have noticed this pattern with single-sided staking, SaucerSwap Version 2, most recently Autopools, and the product that we're currently working on is on-chain governance.  

Also, as our protocol continues to mature, the length of these development cycles tends to increase as considerations like scaling and stability become more pertinent, and this has become especially apparent in recent times, given that we experienced a 10x increase in traffic near the beginning of the year.  

There's also external considerations that are outside of our control. So for example, we are unable to release Wallet Connect despite completing our integration. This is due to several outstanding differences between Hedera wallet providers, which are currently being resolved.  

So all to say, we unfortunately can't move with the same cadence as we did at the beginning of our projects life cycle.  However, we are taking proactive measures, such as hiring more developers and ensuring tech debt is minimized and we have a solid foundation on which to build. I do agree that frequent communication on the status of our development is important and the hyper competitiveness of this space is acknowledged. So we will put out a development update this week, and  this should bring the community up to speed on what has been achieved and what can be expected in the near term.

ABFTFTW 

Thank you, Joseph. Next question is what is the plan to deepen liquidity in Bonzo and also the Hedera DeFi ecosystem as the whole? And then a follow up question is a DEX partnership like Joe, Cake or JUP coming up? 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, it's a great question and it's something that's really top of mind for us at the end of the day. In order to create an economically sustainable protocol, we need to have TVL on Bonzo and then we need to ensure that folks are utilizing that TVL for borrowing. That's where you know majority of the fees come from for the treasury for Bonzo Finance. There's sort of three key things that that we're looking at off the bat that that seemed critical and it's the incentivization of liquidity providers, offering a wide range of assets that are supported by the protocol, and then leveraging stable coins and in particular USDC.  

With the incentivization of liquidity providers, there are two programs that were looking at running. The first one is we are in discussions with HBAR Foundation around liquidity incentives for their DeFi Spring program that SaucerSwap is also partaking in. Those discussions aren't finalized yet, but the hope is to be able to provide HBAR incentives for folks that are both supplying liquidity and borrowing.  

And then the second is a points program that's being employed by the protocol. So we're actually going to be using the HCS-20 point standard using the Hedera consensus service for the protocol. I think it's one of the first times that in the Hedera ecosystem, there's been an employment of this HCS-20 standard for like a real world live use case. I think the only other one might be NFTier. That points program - we were inspired by Margin Phi, Kamino, and some of these other lending protocols that you see on networks like Solana and across the Web3 space - and it's going to run in seasons.  

So each season is around five to six months, and points that are accumulated throughout those seasons for participating in supplying liquidity and borrowing. Users will receive rewards at the end of each season for the accumulation of those points. So we think between those two incentive models, it's sort of strong case for folks to want to be able to supply liquidity to the protocol.  

In addition and sort of tangential to that, there's a lot of liquidity in the ecosystem today that is in the treasuries of these token based projects or in large holders accounts - sometimes employees or investors or folks that have you know are large holders of these token based projects - and there hasn't been a extremely safe place for them to supply that liquidity, which unlocks it for the ecosystem that's more sort of relatively lower risk where they're able to earn rewards on it. And so with Bonzo, because when you support a specific asset, it's a single liquidity pool. It's not like a token pair similar to like a DEX. And in discussions that we've had with token based projects, looking to them as potentially unlocking some of that liquidity that is in their treasuries or by these large holders that for many reasons they're unable to sell their tokens on market, but they do want to utilize them, Bonzo is a very appealing place to be able to supply those assets.  

In addition to that, in terms of a wide range of assets, one of the things that I'm most excited about that's sort of in the process of being developed is bridging infrastructure and in particular the engagement with Axelar. I think the one of the few ways that we can really drive overall TVL and the ecosystem is through the use of bridging, and providing incentives for users to drive liquidity from other networks to Hedera. So we are in the process of waiting for Axelar bridging and bridge providers that are utilizing Axelar to come online, but those wrapped assets that can be brought over are going to play a critical role in like the growth and health of Hedera's DeFi ecosystem and in particular protocols like SaucerSwap and Bonzo Finance. We certainly want to run campaigns that target users on other networks and bring them and liquidity over to the Hedera network, but again, just waiting on the development of this bridging infrastructure to take place, but it feels very promising.  

Then the third thing is stable coins. There's a huge emphasis on USDC right now in Hedera ecosystem as part of HBAR foundation strategy and I think just overarching strategy. The liquidity of USDC on Hedera is quite low relative to other public networks.  So as Gaurang mentioned earlier, USDC and stable coins on lending protocols are one of, if not the most highest utilized asset. We think that's going to hold true for the Hedera ecosystem. So in our discussions with market makers and liquidity providers and other folks that would be supplying that liquidity, USDC is definitely top of mind and we want to be a liquidity powerhouse when it comes to USDC and other stable coin assets.

Pine\_apple 

Thank you so much for that thorough explanation, Brady. So our next question is from Maurice. Is there any consideration to use the Pyth network for better auto pools? 

Joseph 

Yeah. So our team actually has met with Pyth and we do see value in an integration.  In terms of Auto Pools, I know that Ichi uses Chainlinks transaction manager to streamline the rebalance function. So this is done by quickly identifying and confirming transactions during periods of heavy network congestion. I don't think that's particularly relevant to Hedera just due to architectural differences between Hashgraph and Blockchain, but in terms of price oracles, Ichi currently looks at SaucerSwap TWAP oracles and these price assets based on token reserves and liquidity pools. So I'm not sure if they would how they would use third party oracles such as those offered by Pyth, but if you have any ideas, feel free to drop them in our Discord. 



\_\_\_



ABFTFTW 

Next question is when is stage 2 and 3 of single-sided staking going to launch and what are the use cases for the PEC NFTs? 

Joseph 

Yeah. So Peter touched on this, but stages 2 and 3 of single-sided staking will be prioritized following the release of on-chain governance and this is planned for early summer. Our conception of how phases 2 and 3 will work has evolved since it was first announced, and we now have a better sense of how an optimal system could be developed that has product market fit within the Hedera ecosystem. So you can expect marketing and educational material on this extension of single-sided staking to become a focus once token weighted voting and a functioning DAO become live.  

In terms of how Planck Epoch Collectible NFTs relate to stage 3 of single-sided staking, the idea is that holders of these NFTs will have the option of redeeming them for Sauceling NFT, and these Sauceling NFTs in turn can be staked to increase one's weight of rewards in a Community Pool. 



\_\_\_



Pine\_apple 

Thank you for that, Joseph. So this next question is for Brady and Gaurang. Can developers or traders use Bonzo Finance's flash loans to execute complex arbitrage trades or liquidity provision strategies on SaucerSwap? 

Brady (Bonzo Finance) 

Yeah, absolutely. So as mentioned before, flash loans can be employed to be able to perform these arbitrage activities in the templates that we're creating for users who are creating flash loans, automatically incorporate SaucerSwap's DEX as part of that. The way that that process might look is a trader identifies that there's a price discrepancy between an asset that's on SaucerSwap and maybe another Decentralized Exchange, or Centralized Exchange. They configure a flash loan where the trader is able to borrow the necessary funds to be able to execute this arbitrage trade that they want to perform. All within the same single transaction, the trader would sell the borrowed assets on the exchange with the higher price and then buy them back on SaucerSwap at a lower price as an example. Then finally, the trader repays the flash loan using the profits from the arbitrage trade and then keeping the remaining profits for themselves. This is sort of one example that flash loans can be utilized for.  

In terms of liquidity provisioning - you can borrow assets against your collateral on Bonzo and then you really can do anything that you want with those assets that you've borrowed. So one of the things that I could anticipate seeing is there are various APY rates on SaucerSwap for providing liquidity. Based on these different asset types, and let's say you're a large holder of HBAR, you want to be able to get exposure to these other assets to supply them as liquidity and earn interest or earn rewards for doing so, but you don't want to sell your HBAR in order to do that. So you can collateralize your HBAR using Bonzo. You can take out a loan of let's say USDC because USDC interests APY on SaucerSwap is pretty high. There is a small borrow APY that you would pay for borrowing the USDC from Bonzo, but you would supply that to SaucerSwap and you'd be earning an ideally larger APY for supplying it as liquidity to the protocol. That is one strategy where liquidity provisioning can take place where it utilizes Bonzo and it utilizes SaucerSwap. That's going to help deepen the liquidity for assets on SaucerSwap's DEX, but then also create more sort of efficient market. So with greater liquidity in SaucerSwap's DEX, there's a less likely chance of slippage and other benefits that come along with that, as well as efficiencies.

ABFTFTW 

Awesome, Brady, I appreciate all that information. That's really fascinating stuff. This is where we break away from the traditional AMA and move on to the TMS because this isn't the question, this is tell me something. So Anon wants to tell us. I think it's appropriate to use AI technologies to be more inclusive of non-English speaking communities and not be attacked with so many questions afterwards. Joseph, you want to tell him something back? 

Joseph 

Sure, take a stab. Yeah. So we actually did leverage AI to translate our gitbook documentation into, I believe, 11 different languages. I do think there's also value in translating the AMA transcripts, so I appreciate this suggestion. Slightly unrelated, but adding localization and multi-currency support to the webapp would also increase SaucerSwap's accessibility to non-English speakers. I'm not sure if automating this with AI is necessarily the right approach, as we'd want to ensure the translations are accurate, but in any case, we definitely plan on looking into this once current roadmap items are completed.

Bridging DOT to Polkadot,cosmosnetwork,18svpqh,2023-12-28 09:53:34,3,0.71,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/18svpqh/bridging_dot_to_polkadot/,zeb737,,"Greetings everyone.

I would like to bridge my DOT that is now on Osmosis to Polkadot, but I am unsure what is the optimal way to do so. I have very little experience with bridging assets between ecosystems.  

I don't know what bridge is used to wrap the DOT that I have. I suppose it is not axelar since there is also an axl-wrapped version of DOT on Osmosis. If I try to withdraw via Osmosis I get redirected to a blocked page.

Would it be easiest to swap to DOT.axl, withdraw to axelar and somehow bridge to Polkadot? If it would be easier to send a different asset to Polkadot instead then let me know as well 😅 However I do intend to stake DOT over there. 

Thanks in advance"

Happy Halloween! 2023 Audit Statuses Of Canadian Cryptocurrency Platforms,QuadrigaInitiative,17m8jpw,2023-11-02 13:16:58,13,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaInitiative/comments/17m8jpw/happy_halloween_2023_audit_statuses_of_canadian/,azoundria2,,"I post one of these every year, but this one is special.

It’s true we had Einstein collapse shortly after [my 2019 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaInitiative/comments/dpl9jg/happy_halloween_audit_statuses_of_canadian/), [my 2020 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaInitiative/comments/jlz2m8/happy_halloween_updated_audit_status_of_canadian/) was just before the collapse of $330m CRED, and [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaInitiative/comments/qkcxuz/happy_halloween_2021_audit_statuses_of_canadian/) was followed by massive hot wallet breaches of BXH ($139m), BitMart ($192m) and Ascendex ($77.7m).

But few could have predicted what came after my 2022 post.

# A Quick Ftx for High Prices

While Americans celebrated Veterans Day and the rest of the world Remembrance Day, Sam Bankman-Fried launched a “remembrance day” of his own. While many had their moment of silence for soldiers who gave lives for our freedom, [Sam Bankman-Fried gave a moment of speechless stunned silence for millions of users everywhere](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1591089317300293636).

For the next few days, unbacked digits changed hands. No funds came out, [except if you lived in the Bahamas](https://blockworks.co/news/ftx-re-enables-withdrawals-but-only-in-bahamas). And except for [$477m in a large “hack” the very next day](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/crypto-exchange-ftx-has-allegedly-lost-around-477-million-during-a-hack) [supposedly by the Bahamian Securities Commission](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/supposed-477-million-ftx-hack-was-actually-a-bahamian-government-asset-seizure-11668782216), [utilizing Kraken](https://twitter.com/c7five/status/1591434844760076290), but also [supposedly by Russian money laundering criminals](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-477-million-ftx-hack-following-the-blockchain-trail).

Suddenly, the distinction between numbers on a website and real blockchain assets mattered. [Sam is “really sorry, again, that we ended up here”](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1591089320290816000).

# Zero Knowledge Snarkasm

All of this led to a sudden rush of exchanges touting various “proof of reserves” claims. I’ll be succinct and non-iterative, but I have to be argumentative.

I’ve read papers. I’ve looked at Github. I’ve watched MIT lectures on YouTube. I even attended an online seminar devoted to the topic. I’ve spent hundreds of hours trying to figure out how it works. I am officially so close to zero knowledge understanding!

And these proof algorithms depend on every user checking in order to work. Even then, just listen to an expert describe the vast number of ways that [a platform generating a zkSNARK could cheat in their proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR0kuaHxO-k&t=5038s). What is a point in such a trustless system if nobody can use it?

# Stablecoins and Leverage Banned

I’m sure most Canadians won’t shed a tear for tether, even as the only “Value-Referenced Crypto Asset” without [“6 accounts or less own\[ing\] 80+% of the supply”](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-49c). But what about DAI? RAI? Wrapped bitcoin? Wrapped ethereum? [All banned in Canada.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-suspend-trading-usdt-dai-wbtc-weth-and-waxl-stablecoin-canada)

In addition, [all forms of leveraged trading](https://cointelegraph.com/news/canada-bans-crypto-leverage-and-margin-trading-after-ftx-collapse) [are banned in Canada](https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/csa-provides-update-to-crypto-trading-platforms-operating-in-canada/), with no regard to the ways in which they can reduce price volatility impact and hedge risks, or improve market efficiency.

Can't afford an offshore shell corporation but still want equal market access? Sucks being you and being poor. You clearly aren't smart enough to make your own decisions with your money. But despite your financial merit lack, the tiny island nation of Palau will take pity on you and issue you a digital ID. The program was [launched by](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1535591635307794432) Binance’s CZ in person then [denounced as FUD](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1670886662832812041) a week later by Binance’s same CZ, however the IDs reportedly still work on many other platforms. If it doesn't work, oh well. Palau thanks you for your generous economic contribution.

# OSC Warns and “Reprimands” CoinField

CoinField finally collapses after operating since 2018. Withdrawal delays were already reported as [“close to a year”](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaInitiative/comments/yijbbe/comment/iujy6kw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in October last year, which according to the OSC means [“approximately late 2022”](https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2023-10/soa_20231002_manticore-labs.pdf).

With “approximately CAD 69.4 million” from Canadian investors at stake it was definitely urgent. Which is why 6 months later (in June) the OSC added CoinField to their ""\[i\]nvestor warning and alerts"" list along with [500+ platforms no one heard of](https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-warnings-and-alerts?page=4). Everyone be warned! [CoinField is “not registered in Ontario”](https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/warnings/coinfield). Such harsh and shocking allegations!

After a few more month of taking investor deposits without any withdrawals, CoinField finally went offline in August. Once again the OSC was right there for Canadian investors. It’s only been two more months and the OSC has now prepared [an “allegations” document](https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2023-10/soa_20231002_manticore-labs.pdf).

In addition to wanting CoinField to be “reprimanded”, they must pay and pay and pay. “\[P\]ay an administrative penalty of not more than $1 million for each failure to comply” and “pay the costs of the Commission investigation and the hearing”. We must “hold \[CoinField\] accountable” and “signal that crypto asset trading platforms flouting Ontario securities law will \[eventually\] face regulatory action”. It's so extremely important millions of dollars of the misappropriated funds from Canadian investors be paid to the OSC!

# Netcoins Reveals Customer Passwords

Here's a question. If warning Canadians after a platform collapses should net the OSC $4m + the hearing cost, how much should they pay back when they utterly fail to protect Canadians by providing ""exemptive relief"" to a platform which clearly does not prioritize security.

The blockchain space has seen its fair share of privacy breaches to date, from CoinSquare's massive breach in 2019 to dozens of other cases of mailing list breaches. But most of them don't involve passwords, much less [the ""email address, Netcoins password, first name, last name, phone number, date of birth, occupation, address, and government-issued ID type and number""](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/17at9pz/netcoins_data_breach/).

The most basic security precaution should have passwords hashed such that secure passwords can't be realistically brute-forced, and there's no reason the KYC information needs to be stored online or in an unencrypted form. This comes on the back of [a fraudulent withdrawal of $1.58m in April last year](https://betakit.com/netcoins-user-walks-away-with-an-estimated-1-58-million-after-software-vulnerability/) and a [""security breach"" of $343,000 this year](https://betakit.com/netcoins-loses-34300-in-second-security-breach-within-17-months/).

The OSC happily [renewed their ""audited financial statement relief"" ""based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application""](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/netcoins-inc-2) with no mention of any breach in the decision.

# Jimmy Zhong Jailed For Double Clicking

Jimmy Zhong was mostly a misfit for his youth, struggling to make friends. Until he discovered bitcoin. One day, he accidentally double clicked the withdraw button in Silk Road. After exploiting a bunch of times across several accounts, he helped Ross Ulbricht diagnose and patch it, for which he received more coins as a bounty. The matter was settled as far as any party was concerned.

Jimmy never spent the coins. In 2019, he accidentally made a single transaction associating those coins with unrelated coins that had KYC. Fast forward to 2021, a burglar broke into his house. He reported to authorities, and then naively opened his home to them for an ""investigation"". They seized those bitcoin [along with all his personal bitcoin, his stake in a Memphis-based company, and cash and metals from his home](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction). To help compensate, this year they at least agreed to house and feed him for a year. Unfortunately his [""new accommodations""](https://news.bitcoin.com/silk-road-hacker-sentenced-to-a-year-in-prison-for-wire-fraud/) don't allow pets, so one of his friends is taking care of his dog.

Whitehat hackers who exploit platforms and received bounties must understand the precedent set here. There were not even victims here to claim funds. Authorities took more than what was ""stolen"" for themselves. They asserted they could take the rest of his wealth simply because of how many coins went through silk road as a [""Substitute Assets/Money Judgment""](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction). [""80% of all bitcoin in existence went through Silk Road""](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silk-road-was-the-darknet-market-testing-ground-for-bitcoin). Your crypto funds in most Canadian exchanges are now stored in the United States, courtesy of yours truly. All it would take is the right [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) or [economic crisis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2023/08/05/recession-forecast-still-right-for-late-2023-or-early-2024/?sh=33e7c3ca5cf1) for [history to repeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102).

# Canadian Platform Transparency Rankings

* **Canadian Exchange Disasters** \- Past (and present) disasters to help illustrate risks.
* **Platform Acquisitions** \- Platforms acquired this year. So long and farewell.
* **No External Verification** \- A platform that doesn’t appear to give any indication of any external auditing or verification. You may want to avoid these platforms, but sometimes these are just because this information is not available easily.
* **External Verification Claim** \- There is some claim that they are being verified externally. Most of these don’t mention who is performing the audit/verification, what is actually being checked, or all that much about the verification process.
* **Parent Company Audits** \- Through the SEDAR website you can find audits of any publicly traded company. These are their own category. While auditing was performed by a CPA, it actually lacks sufficient clarity to attest cryptoasset backing.
* **Outdated Attestation** \- These platforms have undergone a process where full backing of customer assets was verified by a third party, and that third party published a report to indicate such, but it happened over a year ago.
* **Full Proof of Reserve** \- Full Proof of Reserve generally include public wallet addresses, digital signatures, and a public hash list or Merkle tree so customers can independently validate the ongoing asset backing of all participating customers.

# Canadian Exchange Disasters

Now with new disasters!

**FlexCoin** \- As *“*[*the world's first bitcoin bank*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120118203224/http://www.flexcoin.com/)*”* that’s *“not a true bank”*, FlexCoin provided *“a central location for all of your bitcoins”*. *“Bitcoins deposited \[were\] stored on \[thei\]r* [*secure servers*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120119002318/http://www.flexcoin.com/?page_id=15)*”* so you could *“send bitcoins ... via e-mail”*. *“\[F\]lexcoin to flexcoin transfers \[we\]re free”*.

**MapleChange** \- *“A swift, reliable and to-the-point trading platform.”* *“One of \[their\] primary concerns \[wa\]s security for \[their\] customers''* which is why *“keys \[we\]re cryptographically encrypted”*. *""\[W\]ithdraws*[*(sic)*](https://web.archive.org/web/20181028192109/https://maplechange.com/) *are next to instantaneous""*, *""rel\[ying\] solely on the aspect of swiftness""*!

**CoinTrader/NewNote** \- A *“meticulously engineered Bitcoin Exchange”* *“focused on security and tak\[ing\] these risks seriously”*. *“\[Y\]ou don’t have to worry” with* *“90+% cold storage”* and *“cold storage* [*fully insured by Xapo*](https://web.archive.org/web/20150127090729/https://www.cointrader.net/)*”*. The *“registered Canadian corporation”* *“leverage\[d\] good guys to fight the bad guys”*.

**QuadrigaCX** \- Operating since 2013, with *“vast cryptocurrency reserves”* right up to the end. [*""Bitcoins that are funded in QuadrigaCX are stored in cold storage, using some of the most secure cryptographic procedures possible.""*](https://web.archive.org/web/20190131225348/https://support.quadrigacx.com/support/solutions/articles/9000124318-is-quadrigacx-safe-) Even today most of the funds remain *“100% secure”* (including to customers)!

**Einstein** \- You can get *“your money deposited and withdrawn faster than any other exchange”*. As one customer said *""With so many hacks and exit scams, it gives me confidence knowing Einstein is backed by hard-working people just like me.""* Check [their reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/einsteinexchange/) from their *""220,000+ satisfied customers""*.

**EZ-BTC** \- As the world’s *“most user friendly and bespoke crypto currency management platform”*, they have *“strong security”*. [*“All your coins are kept in cold storage. They’re safe.”*](https://web.archive.org/web/20170603211116/https://www.ezbtc.ca/) The presence of physical ATMs helped build customer confidence for their promised 9% annual return.

**CoinBerry** \- ""Research and continuous education of cryptocurrencies and the markets will arm you with the highest protection level possible."" [""\[T\]here were no withdrawals processed from Coinberry's hot wallet for about 17 hours.”](https://twitter.com/cipher_blade/status/1321862599433089025) [but Canadians were only informed years later!](https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/software-glitch-allowed-users-to-acquire-3-million-in-bitcoin-without-paying-coinberry-alleges-in-lawsuit)

**CoinRise** \- “A pioneer in the field of cryptocurrency trade and exchange, Coinrise has been leading the industry for over 20 years.” ""It was clear for us, as a reputable investment brand, that our clients are going to benefit from this decision taken by the government just as much as us.""

**CoinField** – A [“fully regulated” “cryptocurrency exchange operating in 186 countries”](https://web.archive.org/web/20230829025203/https:/www.coinfield.com/) “Trade confidently”. “Invest in CoinField Coin for a Unique Opportunity to Grow Your Wealth, Earn Rewards and Enhance Food Security in Africa.” “\[E\]asy access to your funds” is “COMING SOON”.

# Platform Acquisitions

**CoinSmart** \- Some ""Changes to Your CoinSmart Account"". ""On October 1st, 2023 CoinSmart plans to transfer all client accounts, including yours, to Bitbuy"". ""The migration is expected to be completed by the end of the day October 1st"". The login page still states they ""are currently [transfering\[sic\]](https://crypto.coinsmart.com/login) your account"" Definitely “making digital finance & [entertainment](https://vimeo.com/843732651) accessible”.

**CoinBerry** \- CoinBerry [where millions of dollars went missing](https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/software-glitch-allowed-users-to-acquire-3-million-in-bitcoin-without-paying-coinberry-alleges-in-lawsuit), had a busy year [completing a third party Proof of Reserves attestation](https://assets.website-files.com/5d2508286ad064447b47e209/637259483c5c1bfe7841bbed_Coinberry%20Proof%20of%20Reserves%20-%20Q3%202022.pdf) and [settling a lawsuit](https://betakit.com/amid-wonderfi-deal-coinberry-reaches-settlement-in-cinaport-lawsuit-following-failed-tsxv-takeover/). Above the header proclaiming ""Canada's best crypto exchange"" is a note that [""\[a\]ll Coinberry accounts have been transferred to Bitbuy""](https://www.coinberry.com/).

# No External Verification

**Coinut** \- The Coinut platform expanded from being “\[t\]rusted by 1,000,000+ global users” to being “\[t\]rusted by 1,500,000+ global users”. They no longer claim to be [""The Most Secure Cryptocurrency Exchange""](https://web.archive.org/web/20221101052244/https:/coinut.com/). According to the website, they perform a “\[r\]eal-time internal audit”, however details are not public. While they have a ""\[s\]emi-manual process of big withdrawals'', it’s unclear if any protection exists against attacks with lots of smaller transactions. Funds have all been moved to Coinbase Custody in the United States.

# External Verification Claim

**Bitvo** – Bitvo is “\[y\]our crypto trading platform”, proudly announcing “1% withdrawal fees” on all coins. Originally a [whitelabel of AlphaPoint](https://alphapoint.com/case-study-bitvo/), a service which was [breached in May of 2019](https://www.quadrigainitiative.com/casestudy/bitcoinsnorwayalphapointattack.php), we still can’t figure out whether they are [*“Canada's premier cryptocurrency trading platform”*](https://bitvo.com/) or merely[ *“on a mission to become Canada’s premier cryptocurrency trading platform”*](https://bitvo.com/meet-the-team/). In any case, their [attempt to be acquired by FTX seems to have fallen through](https://www.reuters.com/technology/canadas-bitvo-ends-acquisition-deal-with-bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-2022-11-15/).

Bitvo’s cold storage is provided by BitGo. Bitvo assures customers they operate *“on a full-reserve basis”* however “the securities regulatory authority … received an application from \[Bitvo\] exempting the\[m\] from” having “to [deliver annual audited financial statements to the regulator](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/bitvo-inc)” They “anticipate\[ they\] will be able to obtain audited financial statements for the Filer's 2022 financial year end.” There is no word published on whether these have been obtained.

**CoinSquare** \- A “trusted cryptocurrency marketplace” with “trading activity continuously monitored”. “\[U\]nlikely” to “becomes insolvent”, having grown past [going offline](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/c0ylgy/this_is_what_caused_the_coinsquare_downtime_on/), suffering [*data breaches involving thousands*](https://blog.coinsquare.com/coinsquare-ceo-response-to-data-breach/), and [paying millions in fines for inflated trading volume](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinsquares-leadership-forced-out-after-wash-trading-55b). The bitcoin “volume” listed on CoinSquare’s homepage right now is a totally legitimate “CA$27.04B”.

Client assets are stored in Coinbase Custody in the United States. While they also have a custody arrangement with Tetra Trust in Canada, [according to agreements with the OSC, this only covers ""Crypto Assets not supported by Coinbase""](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/coinsquare-capital-markets-ltd). CoinSquare achieved notability as the first to prepare audited financial statements - done by a [*“national accounting firm”*](https://blog.coinsquare.com/coinsquare-secures-big-5-banking-relationship-and-completes-third-party-financial-audit/) whose identity was protected under an NDA. Both [IIROC](https://www.iiroc.ca/news-and-publications/notices-and-guidance/coinsquare-capital-markets-ltd) and [OSC](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/coinsquare-capital-markets-ltd)  appear to lack an explicit requirement to submit financials of CoinSquare itself, however it's possibly happening?

**NDAX** \- One thing NDAX has not done in contrast to other Canadian platforms is give up custody of funds, however the OSC states they are [“proficient and experienced in holding Crypto Assets”](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/pru_20230324_ndax.pdf) and still working on [“an effective system of controls and supervision to safeguard the Crypto Assets](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/pru_20230324_ndax.pdf) and ... a mechanism for the return of the Crypto Assets to clients in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency”. Apparently “launch\[ing\] the NDAX Trust Co.” Apparently the [""highest regulatory and"" ""compliance standards""](https://ndax.io/about-us) include [all-caps disclaimers](https://ndax.io/disclaimer) and [freezing accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/14w2x9p/comment/jrh848l/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). [""Th\[eir\] \[s\]ecurity \[page\] was last updated on June 15, 2023""](https://ndax.io/security/) to[ remove a comma](https://www.diffchecker.com/ICLo22RM/).

The registration undertaking [mentions a clause for ""the Filer \[being\] temporarily unable to obtain audited financial statements""](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/pru_20230324_ndax.pdf). The NDAX platform also mentions “\[d\]aily reconciliation of financial assets on and off the platform is performed to record assets’ integrity”. No external visibility. There are [extensive complaints against NDAX on the Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/ca/ab/calgary/profile/cryptocurrency-exchange/ndax-0017-109562/complaints).

**Newton** \- ""[Newton chaNewton charges(sic see last FAQ)](https://www.newton.co/support)"" forward as ""\[t\]he crypto trading platform [you can trust](https://www.newton.co/)"" with ""all of \[y\]our amazing [coins](https://web.archive.org/web/20210916214612/https:/www.newton.co/blog/threes-a-party-luna-ust-omg-on-newton)"". You can ""\[t\]alk to a human"" as part of their ""\[w\]orld class support"" but it's probably a scammer since they ""don’t offer phone support"".

Newton was the [most eager to give up control over customer funds](https://web.archive.org/web/20210124235609/https:/www.newton.co/custody), first sending them to Balance, which [""\[m\]ultinational companies trust""](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127195825/https:/balancenow.ca/).

**VirgoCX** \- Come on down to 'goCX, [""Canada's trusted cryptocurrency trading platform""](https://virgocx.ca/en-about-virgocx) where [“you have total control”](https://virgocx.ca/en-security) over your funds. (Despite funds being in their ""offline storage"" stored with CoinBase Custody in the US.) [“Your cryptocurrency is safe with \[their\] 2FA and SSL protocols”](https://virgocx.ca/en-security).

No longer [""Canada's top regulated cryptocurrency trading platform""](https://web.archive.org/web/20230518115904/https:/virgocx.ca/en-about-virgocx/) they reportedly [""engage trusted third parties to conduct routine audits such as proof of reserve audit""](https://virgocx.ca/en-security) however no such audits are published or mentioned [in their OSC agreement](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/virgo-cx-inc).

WealthSimple was included in [a potential class action lawsuit over hidden fees](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-crypto-lawsuit-wealthsimple-shakepay/) alleging ""some of the highest fees in the industry"". Reviewing [the original OSC agreement](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2021-06/ord_20210622_wealthsimple.pdf), it appears they were initially unable to “deliver annual audited financial statements.” They have [renewed their agreement with the OSC again this year](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-06/ord_20230623_wealthsimple.pdf) and [audits are not mentioned](https://www.diffchecker.com/fVHKAEed/).

# Outdated Attestation

**BitBuy** \- “Canada’s most secure and trusted platform” now with a “VP of Hugs and High Fives” and with the users of [CoinSmart](https://crypto.coinsmart.com/login) and [CoinBerry](https://www.coinberry.com/).

There are no restricted dealer arrangement changes with the OSC since 2021, after moving funds from [Canadian-based Knox](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/gro91k/bitbuy_knox_canadas_first_fully_insured_bitcoin/) to [US-based BitGo](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/bitbuy-technologies-inc). BitBuy has operated since 2016, and was the first to get a [*“Proof of Reserve and Security Audit Report”*](https://web.archive.org/web/20211106072835/https:/bitbuy.ca/assets/documents/Bitbuy-Proof-of-Reserve-and-Security-Audit-Report.pdf) in early 2019 (which they’ve since [removed](https://bitbuy.ca/assets/documents/Bitbuy-Proof-of-Reserve-and-Security-Audit-Report.pdf)). According to the OSC, they are still ""deliver\[ing\] annual unaudited financial statements"", with no update since [their WonderFi acquisition](https://www.wonder.fi/press-release/wonderfi-announces-closing-of-bitbuy-acquisition).

**Kraken** – Kraken “periodically” continues to prepare one of the best available proofs, though the last one was June 2022. Their Proof of Reserves has now been relegated to [a subsection of their security page](https://www.kraken.com/features/security). The proof is still about auditor trust. You can only access one Merkle tree leaf, and all the source code from Kraken does is generate the leaf ID, only proving it's based on user balance. In the Armanino proof, the full Merkle path is available, however looking up intermediate nodes report that the “Merkle Leaf was not included”. Assuming full trust and faith in the auditor, all this demonstrates is one client with a matching balance. To be clear, that's still more than other platforms.

Kraken previously became the [first exchange to be a bank](https://coingenius.news/kraken-gets-license-for-wyomings-first-cryptocurrency-bank/) in Wyoming, and has most recently [started pre-registration to operate in Canada](https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/pru_20230324_payward-canada.pdf). However, it's worth noting Kraken has controversies including [operating illegally in New York](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.513075/gov.uscourts.nysd.513075.1.0.pdf) and [legally silencing staff ](https://www.theregister.com/2020/02/12/kracken_cryptocurrency_eff_glassdoor/). One former Kraken employee alleged that [bank accounts of Kraken were actually running millions of dollars short](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2019/12/17/kraken-exchange-sued-by-whistleblowing-ex-employee-allegations/).

**ShakePay** – This year, [ShakePay became a restricted dealer in Canada](https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/shakepay-inc). ShakePay [published a CipherBlade report, back in 2020](https://help.shakepay.com/en/articles/4380414-shakepay-reserves-and-security-report). ShakePay has undergone [no subsequent published assessments](https://shakepay.com/security). Crypto funds are presently held in Coinbase Custody.

ShakePay  was included in [a potential class action lawsuit over hidden fees](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-crypto-lawsuit-wealthsimple-shakepay/) which alleges that ""some of the highest fees in the industry"". The current price is not displayed unless you already have an account, while most other platforms display pricing information publicly.

# Full Proof of Reserves

A key idea behind proof of reserves is letting customers verify funds are backed through a proof which can run independently. Customers check their inclusion without having to notify the platform of their decision, and without having to depend on trusting a third party. We still hope to be able to put a Canadian exchange in this category in the future.

# Summary and Conclusions

Hope this helped to give you an overview of Canadian exchanges.

Here's a curated recap of the pivotal moments in centralized fully reserved stable coins from 2022 to 2023.

&#x200B;

* May 2022: Stablecoins post LUNA/UST collapse
* September 2022: Binance delist USDC
* Feb 2023: NYDFS terminates Paxos BUSD
* March 2023: USDC entangled in US Banking crisis
* June 2023: Binance launches TUSD and      FDUSD
* July 2023: Multichain bridge hack
* August 2023: Tether and Binance: A Public Spat
* September 2023: The TUSD info leak
* October 2023: BTC “god candle” and FDUSD

&#x200B;

**Stablecoins Post LUNA/UST Collapse**

Post LUNA/UST collapse in May 2022, centralized fully reserved stable coins experienced a resurgence, with the big 3, USDT (Tether\_to), USDC (Circle) and BUSD (Binance & Paxos) leading the charge in both marketcap and trading volume. The market perceived USDC to be the more regulated and safer option thus its share of marketcap and trading volume climbed fastest among the three. It reached a peak of 55B in July 2022, only 10B away form the oldest and #1 stable coin, USDT.

&#x200B;

**Binance delist USDC**

The first shot of the 2022-2023 stablecoin war was fired by Binance when they delisted USDC pair on September 29th, 2022 while at the same time incentivizing BUSD with 0% fees on major trading pairs.\\

https://preview.redd.it/xjumn3lnpnwb1.jpg?width=1253&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72adb86dd3cd77cc182a77d24008793bd4021c84

[https://twitter.com/binance/status/1566818107758460929](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1566818107758460929)

[https://twitter.com/cz\_binance/status/1566857303399272448](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1566857303399272448)

This led to a significant decline of USDC marketcap from 55B to 42B

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**NYDFS terminates Paxos BUSD**

USDC issuer, Circle, fought back and filed a complaint to the NYDFS bolstered by an investigation from chain analytics firm, ChainArgos.

[https://twitter.com/DataFinnovation/status/1609847100149489666](https://twitter.com/DataFinnovation/status/1609847100149489666)

This probe unearthed discrepancies: while BUSD on Ethereum was fully backed, its counterpart on the BSC blockchain often fell short of 100% backing. The revelation led the NYDFS to issue a stern directive to Paxos in February 2023: halt the minting of BUSD.

https://preview.redd.it/0a0zxz0ppnwb1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8cd9d925592501f63fe875d3106a963bb244f5a

[https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1625304637350748161](https://twitter.com/Cointelegraph/status/1625304637350748161)

The consequences were swift: a slump in Binance CEX trading volume and a liquidity drought in BSC DeFi, especially as the most liquid pools on Pancakeswap, BSC's top DEX, were denominated in BUSD. Paxos issued a statement that it is sunsetting BUSD but will still process BUSD redemption until February 2024.

&#x200B;

**USDC entangled in US Banking crisis**

A subsequent resurgence of USDC was abruptly halted only a month later in March 2023, due to the US Banking Crisis

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023\_United\_States\_banking\_crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_banking_crisis)

in which Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), where a significant portion of USDC reserves were held, became insolvent.

[https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1634650306234515460](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1634650306234515460)

As market participant realized the situation direness, USDC begun to depeg reaching a low of 0.88

Several DeFI protocols that hardcoded USDC price to 1 were promptly exploited resulting in millions of dollars in losses. USDC rebounded the next day from the announcement that the FDICgov will make all SVB depositors whole and the Federal Reserve will buy treasury holdings of troubled banks at par value, a departure from previous public policy.

[https://twitter.com/FDICgov/status/1635221180096577537](https://twitter.com/FDICgov/status/1635221180096577537)

[https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1635059024050937856](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1635059024050937856)

Though USDC survived, the damage to its reputation remained and it’s marketcap continue to dwindle from this point on with most of it migrating to USDT / Tether. With BUSD on end-of-life cycle and USDC reputation tarnished, USDT / Tether regained dominance in trading volume on most overseas exchange including Binance and also on-chain in many DeFI protocols.

&#x200B;

**Binance's Attempt with TUSD and FDUSD**

Binance tried again with a new stable coin TUSD (TrueUSD), seemingly in partnership with Justin Sun

[https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1716182312520384549](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1716182312520384549)

They promoted TUSD pair with 0% maker and taker fee and also seeded liquidity on BSC Pancakeswap DEX with liquidity pool farms for the TUSD -USDT pair

[https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671624268822478848](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1671624268822478848)

In June, in addition to its TUSD offering, Binance also launched FDUSD (FirstDigital) with similar marketing as TUSD

[https://twitter.com/cz\_binance/status/1664135832863752199](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1664135832863752199)

&#x200B;

**Multichain Bridge Hack**

One month later in July 2023, MultichainOrg, a popular bridge in DeFI was seized by the Chinese police

[https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1679768407628185600](https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1679768407628185600)

and along with it almost the entire bridged USDC and USDT supply in FTM blockchain is gone

[https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1680052793166684160](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1680052793166684160)

This event highlighted the need of a trustless bridge for chains that has no native USDC or USDT support and made axelarcore bridge, a solution endorsed by uniswap and circle, rose in popularity.

[https://x.com/axelarnetwork/status/1669382878101229568?t=t0I\_PEET3VBpwdvd-Vswsg&s=35](https://x.com/axelarnetwork/status/1669382878101229568?t=t0I_PEET3VBpwdvd-Vswsg&s=35)

&#x200B;

**Tether and Binance: A Public Spat**

In August 2023, jibes were exchanged between Tether and Binance with each implying of the other’s impropriety. During a twitter AMA , Binance CEO’s Changpeng Zhao stated that USDT is a black box without any proper audit.

[https://protos.com/why-does-changpeng-zhao-have-stablecoins-on-the-brain/](https://protos.com/why-does-changpeng-zhao-have-stablecoins-on-the-brain/)

While Tether’s CTO, Paolo Ardoino accused Binance of intentionally de-pegging USDT

[https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1687203348561223680?s=20](https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1687203348561223680?s=20)

&#x200B;

**The TUSD Info Leak**

TUSD slowy started to gain trading volume until a scandal broke out in September in which a hacker leaked TUSD clients info

[https://www.theblock.co/post/256661/trueusd-third-party-security-breach-revealed-blockchain-wallet-addresses-of-clients](https://www.theblock.co/post/256661/trueusd-third-party-security-breach-revealed-blockchain-wallet-addresses-of-clients)

In late October, an investigation by the same firm that exposed BUSD inconsistent backing, ChainArgos, revealed that TUSD deployer key was likely compromised and used to create TEURO

[https://twitter.com/ChainArgos/status/1716263349455900771](https://twitter.com/ChainArgos/status/1716263349455900771)

This revelation eroded confidence in TUSD and it became slightly off peg at -0.4% on October 24th

&#x200B;

**BTC's 'God Candle' and FDUSD's Sudden Spike**

During the BTC “God Candle” pump of 23-24 October, FDUSD which has been relatively dormant until that time experienced a sudden volume spike that made its volume/marketcap climb to >700% and dominated BTC buying compared to USDT

https://preview.redd.it/jti6fjlrpnwb1.jpg?width=2310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ad107c2a45bda877fd747ef7bdfbf703daf3ded

6. Use [LocalMoney.io](https://localmoney.io/), a P2P crypto on-/offramp for buying and selling. [Read this Medium article](https://kujirabenelux.medium.com/localmoney-io-p2p-fiat-crypto-on-off-ramp-e527c8ef295f) for step-by-step explanation.
7. [El Dorado](https://www.eldorado.market/) (built on Maya Protocol, a friendly Thorchain fork) to swap native BTC, ETH, RUNE, USDT and more to/from $KUJI. Full decentralized exchange (DEX). (Or use [ThorWallet](https://www.thorwallet.org/) mobile-app on your phone.)
8. Use [SquidRouter](https://app.squidrouter.com/) or [Axelar Satellite](https://satellite.money/?source=ethereum&destination=kujira&asset_denom=uusdc&destination_address=) to bridge funds from EVM (Metamask, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, and more) to your Kujira address. This bridge/deposit functionality is integrated into Sonar wallet's deposit options.

*Tip: an easy way to send/'bridge' funds to your Kujira wallet is with Sonar's built-in deposit function. If you have Sonar installed, then check out the deposit options. If you imported an existing (Metamask or other wallet's) seed-phrase into Sonar during set-up, the process becomes very simple, as it shows the assets on other blockchains that are available to bridge to Kujira.*

**Where to get $KUJI on Ethereum (EVM)? (+ $KUJI contract addresses)**

$KUJI is the native coin of the Kujira blockchain, a Cosmos SDK L1 chain, so there is no contract address for it. To buy wrapped versions on EVM chains:

* Ethereum | Contract address: 0x96543ef8d2C75C26387c1a319ae69c0BEE6f3fe7
* Arbitrum - Buy via [Camelot](https://app.camelot.exchange/) | Contract address: 0x3A18dcC9745eDcD1Ef33ecB93b0b6eBA5671e7Ca
* Optimism - Buy via [Velodrome](https://app.velodrome.finance/swap?from=eth&to=0x3a18dcc9745edcd1ef33ecb93b0b6eba5671e7ca) | Contract address: 0x3A18dcC9745eDcD1Ef33ecB93b0b6eBA5671e7Ca

"Native USDC and USDT officially launch within the Cosmos ecosystem, helping to alleviate liquidity fragmentation.",CryptoCurrency,16h2j0p,2023-09-12 16:44:28,5,0.73,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16h2j0p/native_usdc_and_usdt_officially_launch_within_the/,Jcook_14,PROJECT-UPDATE,"***TLDR and stats as of today 9/12, located at the bottom of the post*** 

USDT has been in the Cosmos for over a month now via KAVA and Noble officially announced that USDC is available for mint and transfer today (9/12).

**What is Liquidity Fragmentation within the Interchain?**

Liquidity fragmentation is and issue that grew to prominence through the necessity of wrapping USDC or USDT, through bridging protocols such as Axelar or Gravity bridge. However, now that native USDC is releasing straight into the Cosmos ecosystem, this fragmentation problem will be eliminated with no real necessity for USDC arbitrage, and no bridge risk. The ability to mint USDC or USDT straight to the Interchain, is going to create a more stable and liquid Interchain Ecosystem.

**USDC and the Noble**

Today, is the first day that Circle has officially released USDC into the Cosmos. With an initial 1.4 million USDC minted, which has grown to over 2 million USDC minted since the official released which was announced a few hours ago (9/12 announcement date).

 Circle has been working close with a core Cosmos development team, Strange-love ventures, to build the Noble blockchain. This chain is going to act as a native asset issuance chain, which will act as the native chain for USDC to launch on. That means that people are able to directly deposit their dollars into Circle, and receive USDC directly into the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem.

This blockchain is a huge opportunity for the Cosmos ecosystem to gain serious liquidity and for people and entities to trade using a native version of USDC in the Cosmos ecosystem. There are already projects like Osmosis, which has a proposal to allow fees on the blockchain to be paid using USDC as well as their native OSMO token.

**USDT and Kava**

Kava just recently released the ability to mint USDT natively. Similar to the USDC scenario, this native USDT eliminates the need for bridging USDT from Ethereum, into the Interchain ecosystem. This solves issues such as bridge risk and liquidity entering the ecosystem from various bridges. 

To date, the KAVA chain has issued 90 million USDT and it seems to be growing at a fairly rapid pace.

 ***TLDR: unto this point, USDC and USDT has not been issued natively in the Cosmos ecosystem. So if people wanted to put these stables into the various Cosmos ecosystem chains, they would have to bridge them over from ETH on chains like Gravity bridge or Axelar. However, two blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, Kava and Noble, will allow for USDC and USDT to be issued directly onto their own chain. Then it can be sent to other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem.***

***In order to withdraw the USDC and USDT into actual USD/cash, it’s is more simple and much cheaper than having to send the assets back to the Ethereum network, and then cash out with Circle or Tether using the Ethereum network. Now it can be done with no extra steps. Huge win for the Cosmos ecosystem.***

According to Peckshield, a blockchain security firm, the owner of this address has most likely capitalized on the de-pegging of wrapped assets on MultiChain. The same address can be seen sending 292 ETH to Tornado Cash on August 4, 2023.  Is that a smart trader who arbitraged the price difference or hacker who involved in the recent MultiChain hack?

The next step in advancing liquidity in the Cosmos ecosystem is here. The mainnet launch of Noble was on March 27th, and native USDC will be issued soon, now that mainnet has launched. Cosmoszn is about to begin, as a new era of Cosmos liquidity is upon us.

 ***Edit: TLDR; USDC has not been issued natively in the Cosmos ecosystem. So if people wanted to put USDC into the various Cosmos ecosystem chains, they would have to bridge USDC over from ETH.

This is important in many cases that require building and managing state of more sophisticated dApps. We talk about some impracticalities of messaging and advantages of Omnichain Smart Contracts in this ZetaEducation thread. As per differences in messaging capabilities alone, ZetaChain’s messaging not only supports general data passing and contract calls between chains, but also incorporates the ability to transfer native value between chains where ZETA functions as an intermediary token and universal gas on all chains.

 In contrast, pure messaging solutions like LayerZero and Axelar generally require some form of wrapping to transfer value, which can foist more risk on developers and users over time. Beyond this, a more extensive comparison requires deeper investigation into technicalities such as security, trust, decentralization, ease of development, and minute details like how reverts and subsidization for crypto payments are handled, Etc. For example, an important point of contention is that LayerZero relies on a 3rd party relayer/oracle so it’s not trustless [Source: Circumventing Layer Zero]. In any case, ZetaChain’s distinguishing factor in its toolkit for generic cross-chain programmability is its omnichain smart contract system."

The next step in advancing liquidity in the Cosmos ecosystem is here. The mainnet launch of Noble is on March 27th, and native USDC will be issued soon after that mainnet launch. Cosmoszn is about to begin, as a new era of Cosmos liquidity is upon us.

 ***Edit: TLDR; USDC has not been issued natively in the Cosmos ecosystem. So if people wanted to put USDC into the various Cosmos ecosystem chains, they would have to bridge USDC over from ETH. However, Circle is starting their own sovereign blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, that will allow for USDC to be issued directly onto their own chain, Noble, and then it can be sent to other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem. So there is no longer any reason to bridge USDC from ETH over to the Cosmos ecosystem. Also, in order to withdraw the USDC into actual USD/cash, it’s is more simple and much cheaper than having to send the USDC back to Ethereum network, and then cash out with Circle using the Ethereum network.

Native USDC to the Cosmos ecosystem will likely fill in a huge level of liquidity and eliminate USDC bridge risk in the Cosmos ecosystem,CryptoCurrency,1210tdd,2023-03-24 18:19:07,8,0.79,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1210tdd/native_usdc_to_the_cosmos_ecosystem_will_likely/,Jcook_14,ANALYSIS,"***TLDR at the bottom of the post*** 

Circle has been in a partnership with a core Cosmos development team, Strange-love ventures, to build the Noble blockchain. This chain is going to act as Circle's native asset issuance chain. That means that people will be able to directly deposit their dollars into Circle, and receive USDC directly into the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem.

This solves a problem that has plagued the Cosmos ecosystem, liquidity fragmentation. This issue grew to prominence through the necessity of wrapping USDC, through bridging protocols such as Axelar or Gravity bridge. However, now that native USDC is releasing straight into the Cosmos ecosystem, this fragmentation problem will be eliminated with no real necessity for USDC arbitrage, and no bridge risk.

This blockchain is a huge opportunity for the Cosmos ecosystem to gain serious liquidity and for people and entities to trade using a native version of USDC in the Cosmos ecosystem. There are already projects like Osmosis, which has a proposal to allow fees on the blockchain to be paid using USDC as well as their native OSMO token.

The next step in advancing liquidity in the Cosmos ecosystem is here. The mainnet launch of Noble is on March 27th, and native USDC will be issued soon after that mainnet launch. Cosmoszn is about to begin, as a new era of Cosmos liquidity is upon us.

Community Call Summary - Stride Liquid Staking - Jan 31,EVMOS,10rbx7z,2023-02-01 19:54:59,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EVMOS/comments/10rbx7z/community_call_summary_stride_liquid_staking_jan/,tlopplot,Educational,"# Stride

**Lack of DeFi in Cosmos**

&#x200B;

* Despite the potential, DeFi in Cosmos is still in its infancy
* Main reason for the lack of DeFi in Cosmos versus ETH is due to the trade-off between DeFi yield and staking yield.
* The DeFi hurdle rate is the trade-off between DeFi yield and a 	higher staking yield
   * Stride wants to solve this problem
* Its not an economic trade-off, but a technical limitation
* Stride uses IBC to stake native tokens and return staked versions of those tokens to use in DeFi
* Liquid stakers can earn both staking and DeFi rewards, when they want to unstake, they receive the accumulated staking rewards.

**Stride and stEVMOS Launch**

&#x200B;

* Stride will launch on Evmos February 13th
* Tokens can be staked with Stride and used in a more capital efficient manner with the liquid staking derivative (LSD)
* stEVMOS will be auto compounded daily resulting in an increase in yield
* stEVMOS will be integrated into Nitron, Demex's lending market and 	Umee's lending market
   * Leverage staking can be done with stEVMOS as collateral
* The community wrap Stride st assets through governance proposals
* There will be announcements about upcoming integrations on the EVMOS 	and Stride Twitter
* There is 	an early idea to explore swapping yield bearing assets like LSDs between protocols as a way for treasuries to earn yield

# Flipside Crypto

&#x200B;

* Two sides to the organization:
   * Data side: ingests blockchain data in real time, turning it into human readable code, making it accessible for analytics, curates on-chain data to make it easy for analysts to get insights from
      * Covers various chains such as Ethereum, other EVMs, Cosmos chains
      * Insights engine and protocol advocacy team
      * Works with communities like Osmosis and Axelar to understand needs, provide insights to help the ecosystem grow
   * Governance team:
      * Helps DAOs operate efficiently, streamline and enhance governance processes

**Motivation**

&#x200B;

* Deep belief in the success of crypto and blockchain
* Personal belief in Cosmos, core tenants, independent zones, IBC and interoperability
* Interest 	in EVMOS as convergence of App Chains, Cosmos, Zones, and Ethereum Layer 2s

**Flipside Crypto Grant**

&#x200B;

* They are excited to get deep into Evmos and apply for a grant
* Tools and utilities to provide knowledge in a digestible fashion will benefit everyone
* Grant application process is being looked at

# Q & A

**Testnet Rewards**

&#x200B;

* Eligibility for the testnet rewards is specified in the ""Mars 	Meteor Missions"" blog post on evmos.blog
* Community-driven distribution is mediated by governance and will happen once the V11 governance upgrade happens
* Eligible 	participants' rewards will be staked to random validators

**Canto**

&#x200B;

* Canto is built with technology from the Evmos core development team and uses Ethermint, the same as Evmos
* The idea behind making Ethermint open source was to see more EVM chains within the Cosmos ecosystem, making Evmos a focal point within the Ethermint ecosystem
* Canto is focused on offering a new DeFi experience, while Evmos is focused on 	next-gen application user experiences and cross-chain end-user experiences

**dApps Development and Usage**

&#x200B;

* Main barrier to dApps seeing usage is the cannibalization of yields from staking rewards and the protocol competing with its own DeFi applications
* The goal is to make it easy for developers to build and deploy their own applications
* Liquid staking is one of the main features that can be offered as a chain to incentivize using assets in DeFi that would otherwise simply be staked"

**Who wants to read something interesting and useful?**  

This month, the Axelar team posted some new articles on the blog. Check it all in my thread and read really valuable materials 🤓

* [Axelar Unveils Native EVM Cross-Chain Asset Transfers](https://axelar.network/blog/native-evm-cross-chain-asset-transfers)  
Axelar just introduced a service that enables interchain dApps to transfer native EVM tokens across chains, without the extra step of wrapping first into an ERC-20 on the source chain before transferring to another chain – or unwrapping after arriving back on the source chain. 
* [What Is Quadratic Voting and Why Don’t More Projects Use It?](https://axelar.network/blog/quadratic-voting-DAOs-dPoS-and-decentralization)  
At this early stage of Web3 development, innovation begets innovation, demanding further steps to safeguard decentralization. One such innovation, much discussed but rarely implemented, is quadratic voting. Quadratic voting increases decentralization and makes networks secure in dPoS, DAOs, and other setups.
* [Benefits and Risks: Are Cross-Chain Bridges Worth It?](https://axelar.network/blog/cross-chain-bridges-benefits-limitations-risks)    
In place of true blockchain interoperability, cross-chain bridges have emerged as a means to move assets between networks. Advancements in Web3 continue coming to fruition, allowing more and more people to experience a new frontier in finance and technology. However, just as in any new technology, risk comes alongside growth. This risk has been felt most sharply in cross-chain bridge security.

Cosmos Check-In #9,cosmosnetwork,10fq39h,2023-01-18 21:34:59,31,0.97,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/10fq39h/cosmos_checkin_9/,satriapamudji,Ecosystem :atom_stargate:,"Hey Cosmonauts, here is your 9th check-in! We're quickly approaching the end of January soon, which also means we are closer to Interchain Security coming!

If you’re new to these check-ins, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 10 minutes every week!

So, grab a coffee and let’s dive in.

**➤ Biggest news of the week**

The biggest news this week has to be the news about the hope of Terra’s ecosystem flourishing, after a class action lawsuit — against TFL and Do Kwon alleging fraud — has been dismissed, in addition to Terra’s recent developments.

Also, we have some updates on Interchain Security (or replicated security — which is a term that only nerds say to be brutally honest, like me) through a forum post which expressed the need to ensure Interchain Security is sufficiently tested and secure, thus requiring an external third-party audit.

**➤ Tangible upgrades and launches**

This week, several updates and launches have been made in the Cosmos ecosystem.

1. Interchain Info has released a beta version of their platform, which is intended to bring together fragmented Interchain communities, educational resources, NFT collections, dApps and tools.
2. Carbon has integrated with Arbitrum, allowing users to access $wstETH, $GMX, $GNS, and $USDC natively on Carbon.
3. CUDOS, Fetch, and Desmos have all launched new projects, such as Bubbleswap, Jenesis, and Scripta, respectively.
4. Additionally, Flipside and Harbor from Comdex have made minor updates, such as deprecating certain tables from Axelar and allowing users to mint $CMST using $OSMO as collateral.

**➤ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Next, we look at the non-tangible upgrades, which includes some exciting proposals that are either already on-chain and in the voting process, or will be up for voting in the upcoming days.

1. Composable has released an update for their Centauri testnet, which will enable the flow of assets between Picasso and Cosmos chains.
2. Band Chain has proposed BCIP-10, which will introduce a minimum gas price for network fees.
3. Injective is upgrading to v1.9, which will upgrade dependencies and allow for message signing
4. Cronos is upgrading with Galileo v1.0, which will allow for faster TPS.

➤ **Other interesting happenings**

* The latest edition of Alpha Navigator, a [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Institutional Report says that crypto has outperformed gold and equities straight out of the gate — bull market?
* Bitsong is singing their songs of how this year will be a huge year for them on Cosmos, well, we will have to see about that! Meanwhile, you can check out their new roadmap.
* Artificial Intelligence has been a trending topic recently, and Odin Protocol might be one of the projects on Cosmos that will assist in the AI sector; through data availability.
* Umee markets has garnered more than $3M in TVL — Learn more about Umee here.
* The amount of OKT for liquid staking (stOKT) has reached over 1 million, which is 1/18th of the total OKT supply! Interesting what liquid staking is doing for chains.
* The Synapse Bridge has done more than $18M in volume, and serviced over 8,000 unique addresses after their bridge to Canto went public.
* Last week, we talked about KAVA 12 mainnet, which was supposed to go live on the 19th of January. However, it was recommended that they push this back, and so, KAVA 12 will be only be live on the 25th January instead.

**Wrapping it all up**

That marks the end of week 9, and we are soon approaching the end of January, so all the best for the month ahead! Stay safe in these market conditions, and don’t get too greedy.

As usual, if you found this useful, I would really appreciate upvotes and please comment down below on what you think about this — we will upload more shorts, shortly.

I hope everyone has had a great holiday period, and this check-in marks the last check-in of the year of 2022 (time flies so fast, innit?)

The goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 7 minutes every week! So, grab a coffee and let’s dive in.

**➤ 2022 in recap for Cosmos**

The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant challenges in 2022, including rising inflation rates, the depegging of TerraUSD which hurt Cosmos, and finally the collapse of FTX and various centralized entities. Despite these doom events, Cosmos has remained relatively competitive in terms of valuation, and there has not been a huge decrease in monthly active users.

However, other application-specific blockchain on Cosmos has struggled to gain widespread adoption among users, as the majority of Cosmos’ valuation comprises the Hub.

In our report, we made an argument that we believe 2023 will be a turning point for Cosmos, with the predicted development of over 100 interconnected zones and the majority of valuation spread across various application-specific blockchains by year end of 2023 — with supporting data.

Look forward to the full release of this report, as we will release it in the next few days. Most importantly, let us know what you think about the report.

**➤ Tangible upgrades and launches**

Next, we look at some of the tangible updates and launches that we have seen this week, and can interact with in the next coming days (or now even depending on when you read this).

First up, we have new strategies from Sommelier that will be live on the 29th of November at 4pm UTC. These strategies, “SteadyUNI and SteadyMATIC” are part of the steady strategies.

We are also blessed with the new releases of networks like Lava Network, which allows developers to trustlessly access Cosmos Hub data with Lava’s SDK, and a new network called Nibiru that is now on phase 2 of their testnet, which introduces faster finality, Nibi-Swap pools (AMM pools), and supports permissionless deployment of CosmWasm smart contracts.

Next, Injective’s explorer has been upgraded, allowing for address details to include CW20 token balances and adds CW20 smart contract balance support.

Kava is also now integrated with Axelar, and satellite money users can now transfer assets from any connected chains to Kava.

**➤ Non-tangible upgrades and proposals**

Last but not least, we take a look at the non-tangible upgrades, and interesting proposals.

Just this week, Syntropy has announced that they have switched to the Cosmos ecosystem to fulfill their vision of innovating the future of the Internet by building solutions that improves the decentralization, security and performance of the Internet with DARP and OBX.

Following that, Kujira has announced this week that Sonar will be the name of their wallet, with a focus on native mobile experience that is crafted for a seamless DeFi experience.

We will also soon have 2 interesting proposals, one of which is the second security upgrade for Gravity Bridge which introduces invariant checks, and adds fees, and the proposal for Sentinel Hub’s upgrade to v0.10.0, which is a critical upgrade as it primarily allows for the functioning of smart contracts and enables the token revenue sharing system.

➤ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Ignite is currently negotiating terms to become an independent entity from All in Bits (AiB).
2. Sei has recently partnered with Babylon to enchance the security of Sei by leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Sei has also partnered with SYNTHR to allow users exchange value seamlessly without the need for bridges.
3. ZetaChain has posted their wrap up of 2022, which goes through the metrics and achievements that they have achieved this year, such as having more than 740k users on the Testnet.
4. If you are looking for the hottest news about NFTs, AssetMantle has recently posted a thread which covers the latest news in the NFT space.

# Conclusion

That marks the end of week 6, and the last check-in of 2022. If you found this useful, I would really appreciate upvotes and please comment down below on what you think about this.

Video will be up on Flagship’s YouTube page in the next few days!

I guess the 10-minute boo’ing session he caught at Dave Chappelle’s show in San Francisco was just too much for the philanthropic mogul to handle. All sorts of vultures came out of the woodwork to offer to be his replacement, including the noteworthy Edward Snowden. Double-crossing desk jockey-gone-rogue agent says he would do it for compensation in Bitcoin. Personally, I’d feel better with Lionel Messi taking the reins with his humbleness and great naivety in the English language – I think we’d fare better as a collective. But that’s just my personal opinion.

SBF does not contend to fight against US extradition, where he would likely much rather be in a white-collar detention center over something that came from an episode of the “Toughest Places in the World” docuseries. A healthy balance of FUD and circumstantial evidence is attempting to shift the narrative away from FTX and place it squarely over Binance, who saw BUSD balances on exchanges fall over $6bn in the past month alone. Binance.US meanwhile, has agreed to purchase the distressed assets of Voyager Digital for $1.02bn. Binance also announced a cash injection into Tokocrypto - so go figure, this is not likely to be the same as SBF bailing out all the collateral damage he caused to try to bury their records from ever coming out. OKex and Gate.io resume withdrawals after an issue with cloud service providers was resolved. Axelar launches $60m ecosystem fund to jump start projects looking to build on their stack. TrueUSD launches TCNH, a Tron-based stablecoin pegged to the Chinese Yuan – a direct competitor to the CNH₮ stablecoin launched by Tether earlier this month, also available on the Tron Network. …here is our round-up of curated news  opinions (surely biased) from the world of Blockchain, keeping you informed of the most trending, in-the-know, and controversial topics. In the name of transparent, information dissemination to keep you curious, inspired, and clinically sane…

How To Convert wAXL to AXL from Coinbase and from Metamask,axelar,zm2we0,2022-12-14 16:33:52,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/axelar/comments/zm2we0/how_to_convert_waxl_to_axl_from_coinbase_and_from/,AtlasStaking,Support,"Converting wAXL to native AXL

You want Axelar Network’s native AXL tokens, but Coinbase only offers wAXL. We’ll show you how to convert wAXL to AXL from Coinbase and from Metamask in this step-by-step guide.

What is wAXL?

There are technical limitations that are beyond the scope of this article. They limit centralized exchange ability to offer native AXL tokens to their users. Wrapped Axelar, or wAXL is the ERC-20 EVM compatible version of AXL. That’s a mouth full! Carefully read token info on the exchange to be sure which version you own.

What is the Satellite Bridge?

Satellite is the native Axelar bridge that allows users to move tokens to and from the Axelar Network. The bridge will soon connect all Cosmos chains via IBC to other ecosystems. The bridge is open-sourced, decentralized and simple to use. It takes around 15 minutes to move assets from one ecosystem to another.

How to convert wAXL to AXL from Coinbase

The video below will walk you though it and we’ve also detailed the steps, for those who prefer to read. This post assumes you’ve already set up your Keplr wallet. 

We’re going to send wAXL tokens from Coinbase to the Satellite bridge. The Satellite bridge will then unwrap the tokens into native AXL and send those tokens to your Keplr wallet address.

If you want to know **how to stake AXL tokens**, fast forward the video to 6:08.

1. Open up the Keplr browser extension and select the Axelar network from the dropdown menu.
2. Navigate to [Satellite.money](https://satellite.money/)
3. Click “CONNECT WALLET” and then click on “Keplr”
4. Select Ethereum as the “From” network and Axelar as the “To” network
5. Click the “I want to transfer” drop down box and select wAXL
6. Type the number of tokens you want to send to the bridge
7. Click “Autofill” and the bridge will grab your Keplr receiving address
8. Click “GENERATE DEPOSIT ADDRESS”. This is where Coinbase will send your wAXL tokens
9. Click “Confirm” on the box that pops up
10. Verify that you’re sending enough wAXL tokens to cover the bridge fee
11. Click the clipboard button to copy the bridge’s receiving address
12. Navigate to Coinbase and press “Send/Receive” on the desktop version or “Send” on the mobile app
13. Click “Pay with” on the pop up box that appears and select WAXL
14. Select the number of wAXL tokens you’d like to send and convert to AXL
15. Paste the Satellite bridge’s receiving address into the “To” box
16. The “Note” box is optional and for your information only
17. Click “Continue”
18. Verify the information is correct on the next screen and click “Send now”
19. Click “Done” and your tokens are on the way!
20. Navigate back to the Satellite bridge to view the progress
21. Once the bridge says, “Transfer complete!” open up your Keplr wallet to verify the tokens were transferred

 

How to convert wAXL to AXL from Metamask

This article and video assumes you’ve already set up your Keplr and Metamask wallets.

We’re going to now show you how to send wAXL tokens from Metamask to the Satellite bridge, then from the bridge to your Keplr receiving address.

If you want to know **how to stake AXL tokens**, fast forward the video to 7:35.

1. Import wAXL token contract address into Metamask, if you’ve not done so already.  0x467719aD09025FcC6cF6F8311755809d45a5E5f3 
2. Navigate to [Satellite.money](https://satellite.money/)
3. Click “CONNECT WALLET” and then click on “Metamask”
4. Select Ethereum as the “From” network and Axelar as the “To” network
5. Click the “I want to transfer” drop down box and select wAXL
6. Type the number of tokens you want to send to the bridge
7. Click “Autofill” and the bridge will grab your Keplr receiving address
8. Click “GENERATE DEPOSIT ADDRESS”. This is where Metamask will send your wAXL tokens
9. Click “Confirm” on the box that pops up
10. Verify that you’re sending enough wAXL tokens to cover the bridge fee
11. Click “SEND FROM METAMASK”
12. Approve the transaction in Metamask by clicking “Confirm” in the popup
13. View the progress bar at the bottom of Satellite 
14. Once the bridge says, “Transfer complete!” open up your Keplr wallet to verify the tokens were transferred

That’s it! You now have native AXL and can use those tokens to pay for transaction fees and stake. Please consider staking your AXL with Atlas Staking once we’re in the active set.

Cosmos: Check-in #4,cosmosnetwork,zlo5wv,2022-12-14 06:05:14,24,0.97,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/zlo5wv/cosmos_checkin_4/,satriapamudji,Ecosystem :atom_stargate:,"Hey Cosmonauts, here is your fourth check-in!

Once again, the goal of these check-ins is to provide you with up-to-date and in-depth news about the Cosmos Ecosystem in less than 7 minutes every week! So, grab a coffee and let’s dive in.

**➤ Proposal 88 — which aims to increase the Hub’s tax from 2% to 10% — is now live until 20th December**

In the past few weeks, there have been discussions ongoing to increase the community tax of the Hub from 2% to 10% — in direct response to ATOM 2.0’s funding model.

Just this week, the proposal went live, to change this parameter.

According to the proposal, ATOM already has a treasury that is used for past endavours, funded by taxation on a per-block basis. By increasing the taxation for the Hub, this will increase the inflow of the treasury for future funding of endavours, so there will be no need to create a new entity or mint new ATOMs for treasury funding.

**➤ Improved developing experience**

The developer experience within Cosmos has seen a massive upgrade this week, with Composable Finance launching a CW development solution that saves time for developers, and Tendermint announcing the details of IBC-go’s scheduled upgrade to v7.0.0, which incorporates client refactor work to make light client development easier.

**➤ The battle of the giants continues**

Kujira’s battle with Osmosis continues, as both DEXes introduce fresh developments to widen their capabilities in the Cosmos ecosystem.

Kujira has just announced this week that they are allowing the minting of $USK with $wETH as collateral, and partners up with Axelar to allow for a one-click solution to bring your $ETH from MetaMask to Kujira, which is pretty cool.

Meanwhile, Osmosis launched Stableswap, which allows traders to swap large amounts of stable assets (yes, including wrapped assets) with minimum price impact.

➤ **Other interesting happenings**

1. Inter Protocol ($IST) Economic Committee has voted to establish new minting limits based on their evaluation, after including $DAI in the Parity Stability Module (PSM).
2. Flipside has now included Cosmos in their datasets, and you can easily query for trends, investigate activity and chart the future of IBC for free.
3. It looks like dYdX is about to be launched soon, with their very not-so-subtle tweet, saying that dYdX is about 92% to launch… dYdX admins in this Reddit, wen launch?

## Conclusion

That marks the end of week 4. If you found this useful, I would really appreciate upvotes and please comment down below on what you think about this.

Last but not least, I will also do up a video for check-ins in the next days to come, where it will be more interactive and we test out these updates. Let me know if you’d like me to send you the link!

It says Etherium instead of Cosmos.  I always thought the Axelar USDC was wrapped Cosmos version.  I don't usually play around with USDC in Osmosis, so a little unsure.  When I click withdraw, I get a choice of using MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Kado.  WalletConnect just gives me a QR code.

Seems like I can't, so what's the easiest way to get USDC onto Comdex?"
AXL & WAXL: What is the difference and how to convert it?,axelar,zfuza6,2022-12-08 05:11:59,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/axelar/comments/zfuza6/axl_waxl_what_is_the_difference_and_how_to/,Maria_Everstake,Question,"&#x200B;

**Hey, guys!** 

&#x200B;

I'm sure that everyone heard something about WAXL. Let's focus on details and find the difference between **$AXL** and **$WAXL**  👇

⚡️ AXL is the native utility token that powers the Axelar network. WAXL ticker is recommended to be used for the ERC-20 representation.  

⚡️ Native AXL addresses have the prefix *axelar*. AXL ERC-20 address has the prefix *0x*, the same as other Ethereum addresses.

⚡️  Axelar’s robust security approach ensures that WAXL will be fungible with native AXL. Most exchanges won’t allow you to send the wrong token forward by validating addresses.

⚡️ **Important: Staking is available only with AXL!**

⚡️ **1 AXL = WAXL** and can be swapped by anyone via the Axelar permissionless layer via bridge front-ends such as [Satellite](http://satellite.money). 

&#x200B;

**How to convert WAXL to AXL** through Satellite we've explained in this [guide](https://everstake.one/blog/how-to-convert-waxl-to-axl). Enjoy reading!"

🔥🔥 Circle partners with Axelar to implement cross-chain for USDC,whale_alert,yara91,2022-10-22 11:55:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/whale_alert/comments/yara91/circle_partners_with_axelar_to_implement/,Camellia_Alice,,"➖ In the announcement on October 21, #Circle - the company behind the #cryptocurrency market’s second-largest #stablecoin #USDC, announced a partnership with #Axelar that leverages the role of USDC and cross-chain applications.

➖ #Avalanche, #Cosmos, #Ethereum, #Polygon, and #Sui will be the first chains to be integrated with Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP). The move was announced shortly after Circle launched its USDC bridging protocol and “total attack” to five new blockchains last month.

➖ In essence, Circle monitors and verifies the movement of native USDC between chains eliminating the need to wrap assets. Axelar's GMP takes this process a step further and enables applications to integrate Circle's bridge.

➖ One of the key goals of the Circle and Axelar partnership is to simplify the user experience, from cross-chain swaps, one-click transaction execution to cross-chain #NFTs.

"Exposure to BTC, ETH, and USDC... but fear over wrapped asset hack vulnerability",cosmosnetwork,y8jepq,2022-10-19 20:40:39,13,0.94,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/y8jepq/exposure_to_btc_eth_and_usdc_but_fear_over/,DistantKarma271,Discussion :atomwhite:,"I'm a big Cosmos proponent. But I want exposure to BTC and ETH to balance things out, too. I like that Osmosis offers WBTC and WETH (and USDC for that matter). 

However, I understand these are wrapped assets and, as, such, are only valuable so long as the assets locked on the other side of the bridge are intact. 

I like to think that Axelar has it together, but after living through a few bridge hacks (Wormhole, Nomad, Harmony, etc.), I know what CAN happen. And frankly, it seems like it's only a matter of time for any bridge to be hacked.

So a few questions:
1. In the future, can we expect NOMIC to serve as a very secure ""bridge(?)"" that will provide ""native"" BTC in IBC?

2. Is there anything like NOMIC for ETH planned? I know there is EVMOS, and that has WETH offered, but we saw what already happened there with Nomad. 

3. I understand there will be ""native"" USDC, correct? (And actually right now EEUR serves as a native stable option, so this is less of a concern.) 

But in the meantime, what (if any) are my options for exposure to BTC and ETH on Cosmos without exposure to bridge hack risks?"
The Milkomeda A1 Rollup is Now LIVE on Algorand Mainnet!,AlgorandOfficial,y815dp,2022-10-19 08:15:29,70,1.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/y815dp/the_milkomeda_a1_rollup_is_now_live_on_algorand/,cysec_,,"https://preview.redd.it/5x52n14o7ru91.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a46aa6eb428a17f0c03ec23d2f7104715259bc3

**The Milkomeda A1 Rollup is Now LIVE on Algorand Mainnet!**

The day has come! The Milkomeda A1 Rollup is now live on the Algorand mainnet! This a hugely exciting step for us for multiple reasons, but the main one is that we finally get to share this cutting-edge interoperability solution, that we’ve been working on for months, with the wider world!

Do you want to know how to interact with the Milkomeda A1 Rollup? Read on, we’ve got you covered. If you’ve been living under a rock and this launch is new news to you then you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered too!

While the dev team has been busy building and testing our content team has been writing documentation, social media posts, and blog posts that give you all the information you need about Milkomeda, Algorand, the A1 Rollup, how to use it, how it all actually works, and just why it’s so exciting for both us and the wider blockchain world.

Below are summaries and links to all those content pieces so you can easily find the information you want.

**How to Use the A1 Rollup**

The A1 Rollup users wrapped ALGOs, called milkALGOs, as its base currency. These milkALGOs are used to pay transaction fees on the rollup and are needed to wrap, unwrap, and transact with the multiple different Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) that are whitelisted to be used on the A1 Rollup. Below are links to the guides for transferring these assets to the A1 Rollup.

Wrapping and Unwrapping : [Documentation](https://dcspark.github.io/milkomeda-documentation/algorand/for-end-users/)

Alternatively, if you’re not already using Algorand, you can use our partner dApp Celer to transfer assets to the A1 Rollup! Learn more about how Celer works below. What Projects Can You Use on the A1 Rollup?

Now you’ve got your tokens you’ll want to test out some dApps! Luckily we’ve partnered with a few dApp developers to bring you some of the first dApps for the A1 Rollup and you’ll be able to use them right out of the gate! Find out more about these projects and how you can interact with them below:

**What is Milkomeda Bringing to the Algorand Ecosystem?**

Milkomeda’s chief focus is fostering blockchain interoperability, accomplished by bringing EVM capabilities to non-EVM chains, while creating a seamless user experience. Algorand is a non-EVM chain with multiple other unique factors that make it the perfect candidate for one of the first rollups outside the Ethereum ecosystem. All is well and good, but what does this mean?

[This article](https://medium.com/@milkomedafoundation/how-is-milkomeda-going-to-boost-adoption-and-developers-in-the-algorand-ecosystem-f71497271f95) details the utility and benefits that Milkomeda is bringing to the Algorand ecosystem, (TLDR? here’s a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Milkomeda_com/status/1570474244395667456) on the topic).

**What is a Milkomeda A1 Rollup?**

If you want more detail as to what rollups are and are specifically interested in how the A1 Rollup works (it’s different from the most common types of rollups currently in use), then our article on the [Security of the Milkomeda Algorand Rollup](https://medium.com/@milkomedafoundation/security-of-the-milkomeda-algorand-rollup-77e6ea784ea6) is full of information covering these topics. It also details how the Algorand network is secured too, as layer 1 security is inherited by the layer 2 rollup.

**Why Did We Build our First Rollup on Algorand?**

Algorand has much that makes it attractive to blockchain users: instant transaction finality and transaction confirmation times of under 4 seconds, a transaction throughput of 6000TPS, a sustainability focus (also carbon negative), and a high level of decentralization from allowing any shareholder to participate in their unique and provably secure Pure Proof of Stake™ (PPoS) consensus protocol.

If you’d like to learn more about Algorand’s technical advantages and why we chose Algorand as the site for the first Milkomeda A1 Rollup, keep an eye on our social media because we’ll be releasing additional materials soon.

**Finally: Try the A1 Rollup!**

Now you’ve got all the knowledge you need at your fingertips then give the wrapping and unwrapping of ALGOs a go on the Milkomeda A1 Rollup! Links for the bridge and explorers (testnet and mainnet) are below.

If this is your first time wrapping and unwrapping assets and you’re a little unsure about doing so then you can test the process out on the testnet with test assets before committing to doing it with real assets on the mainnet. After that, jump over to the mainnet implementation and transfer yourself some ALGOs over to the A1 Rollup mainnet and have a go using the live dApps and experience Algorand’s first-ever rollup! Stay tuned with Milkomeda for more announcements regarding the A1 Rollup and what is building on top of it!

Sei has partnered with Axelar Network,u_Commercial_Search_76,xcs8sf,2022-09-12 19:58:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Commercial_Search_76/comments/xcs8sf/sei_has_partnered_with_axelar_network/,Commercial_Search_76,,"Sei, the fastest DeFi Layer 1 is partnering with Axelar to enable cross-chain messaging between DeFi on Cosmos and EVM chains. Axelar is the premier cross-chain infrastructure provider, and this partnership will open up novel possibilities for bridging, messaging, and execution across chains, programming languages, and virtual machines.

One of the core bottlenecks for DeFi scalability is liquidity fragmentation across multiple ecosystems. Billions of dollars worth of crypto assets are locked, wrapped, minted, and burned each day, forcing every chain to compete for TVL in a zero-sum game. Inevitably, the success of DeFi protocols and their underlying chains are highly correlated.

About Axelar

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Our infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any chain, with one click. Axelar is like Stripe for Web3. Axelar is backed by Binance, Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, and Polychain Capital. Axelar is integrated with the Ethereum, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Polkadot ecosystems.

About Sei

Sei is committed to providing best-in-class infrastructure to develop and scale DeFi protocols across Web3. Sei is the fastest L1 on Cosmos and the fastest chain to finality in all of crypto. Sei’s remarkable throughput coupled with its CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) module has revolutionized the capabilities and possibilities for on-chain DeFi. Sei is opening doors to new types of financial products and enabling custom UX improvements such as near zero transaction fees and paying gas with different tokens."

Here is some news covering various chains and projects: Secret Network, u/AnonsNFT, Juno, Stargaze, Crescent Evmos, Sifchain, Axelar, NFTs, DeFi, Kujira, CUDOS. If you enjoyed this give our Twitter a follow [https://twitter.com/CCosmonaut\_](https://twitter.com/CCosmonaut_)

btn.group is [bringing ](https://twitter.com/btngroup/status/1554100593891119104?s=21&t=ku2vK6t6_-i9Knj_-AbxFQ)DeFi limit orders on the Secret Network for those unfamiliar, they are building various tools on the Secret Network and have the immature token $butt. Regardless they are building out useful tools and are a group to watch in the Secret Network. 

Anons [minted ](https://twitter.com/CCosmonaut_/status/1554188184774496256?s=20&t=j2gZx6BodQ2rkK7_WxGt0g)out in roughly 3.5 hours after public mint opened up, raising around $300,000. They have also already had around $60,000 in marketplace volume since then as people likely trade between various assets for features they like and speculate on the price. The Curious Cosmonaut Research future gallery acquired multiple for future researchers to utilize both as a PFP and, more importantly, to join the group.

A project called [Mun](https://mun.money/) Remittance is launching a remittance service in Cosmos and [announced ](https://twitter.com/munblockchain/status/1554413673363509249?s=20&t=evHgkfAod0jdmqHpDIXXRw)that there would be an airdrop coming in Q4 for Cosmos, Juno, Stargaze, Osmosis and a Rekt drop for Luna holders. It is unclear how the team plans to do their on/off ramping but would love to discuss it if you see this. 

Nomad bridge gets [hacked, ](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/nomad-bridge-drained-of-nearly-200-million-in-exploit/)that was bringing assets to EVMOS and is drained around 200 Million dollars. Since then, they have recovered some of the funds. During this time, there was a lot of random arbitrages happening, which actually pushed up the price of EVMOS and some assets. 

The Sifchain [provided](https://twitter.com/sifchain/status/1554543673068716036?s=21&t=r_sFjfiONseNKxht1zWcFw) some business updates, some of which are: adding MNTL to the DEX, work to hide low liquidity pools, the Ambassador program, discussed 6 active proposals, their work to get a grant from Cardano for a bridge, margin trading coming soon, and peggy 2.0 coming.

Strangelove [announces](https://twitter.com/strangelovelabs/status/1554551454613979137?s=21&t=IaRcT61eTfcZbGOSUgIGyg) a new bridge application from their labs supported by the Axelar technology called Easy Bridge.

Some good threads on the announcement were discussed by indivudls like Ethan Buchan [here](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1557021351092920322?s=21&t=DvjyL4asXU3Zyr5QzjysSA), our [thread](https://twitter.com/ccosmonaut_/status/1556778284192391168?s=21&t=DvjyL4asXU3Zyr5QzjysSA) on it not being effective, and some individuals [were](https://twitter.com/buchmanster/status/1557022098777939968?s=21&t=06LcWSH-avzh_0aGywJvSA) “dusting” tokens with “tainted” tokens to prove a point, even individuals like Bryan Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase.

There was various threads on Echelon likely being a scam or at minimum praying on people to try and easily get free capital. Despite the infamous content stealer Dave Cosmos sponsoring it. We aggregated content on that [here](https://medium.com/@cosmonautcurious/echelon-risks-ee80d48a40d5).

Loop Finance is [launching](https://twitter.com/loopdefi_nft/status/1556296213452001283?s=21&t=JBiPCamy3OhBjTFguV8JPQ) an NFT DeFi marketplace in Cosmos. It is unclear if they plan to offer DeFi to NFTs outside of Cosmos. Today the NFT market in Cosmos is still early, which could be a positive or a negative for Loop. It is an interesting idea overall but a difficult market. For example, being non-fungible liquidation is difficult. How do you place a true value on something that is more or less valued independently by individual users? It is an interesting concept, though, especially as larger valued collections come into play. If someone has an NFT collection with $20,000, they may want to borrow $10,000 against that. This would allow, for example, to possibly trade NFTs without selling their main ones. Regardless it is interesting, but it will be a huge challenge potentially.

We opened up an initial [conversation](https://twitter.com/ccosmonaut_/status/1556345214389948416?s=21&t=JBiPCamy3OhBjTFguV8JPQ) around our research on Kava and potential concerns.

Kava Foundation,NQ4,wnbpo2,2022-08-13 06:52:41,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NQ4/comments/wnbpo2/kava_foundation/,rk_1007,," Kava is the fastest-growing blockchain for protocols. Growth is at the core of Kava. Three main layers safeguard growth:

&#x200B;

* Proof of Stake (PoS) Security
* Infrastructure Security
* Financial Reserve Security

Security and growth work together. The breakdown looks like this:

**Governance.**

Kava Foundation governs the growth and three security layers of the Kava ecosystem. These layers can be modified, added to, or removed by Kava governance at any point.

Proposals for all layers are passed by a full Kava governance vote, which ensures an open and decentralized governance process. This arrangement is unlike other blockchain Foundations that pass proposals opaquely with foundation board members.

**Kava Rise. Protocol Growth.**

Kava Rise is a $750M on-chain programmatic developer growth engine that continues to onboard the most innovative developers across the DeFi, GameFi, and NFT verticals.

Kava Rise protocols are rewarded based on the amount of growth they contribute to the blockchain. The growth parameters can be adjusted by Kava governance based on evolving market conditions.

**What They Do**

&#x200B;

* **DeFi Protocols:** P2P borrowing and lending, yield optimization, AMMs, derivatives, stableswaps, insurance, DEXs, DAOs, DeFi infrastructure, and asset management.
* **NFT:** Digital artworks and collectibles, authenticity and identity verification, real estate, medical records, intellectual property, patents, academic credentials, ticketing, and voting.
* **GameFi:** Play-to-earn (P2E), in-game and cross-game DeFi with cryptocurrency and NFT rewards, Metaverse development, and trading of virtual land, avatars, items, and skins.

**Who They Are**

&#x200B;

* Sushiswap
* Beefy Finance
* Ren
* Autofarm
* Multichain
* … and 67+ protocols.

**Infrastructure and Security Layer**

The Infrastructure and Security layers are responsible for the extremely difficult task of making the Kava blockchain performant and secure. Ethereum is not performant.

The cost of a debilitating hack is infinite. It’s everything. Kava invests heavily in the Infrastructure and Security layer to safeguard growth.

**What They Do**

&#x200B;

* Core blockchain infrastructure and security
* Data Services
* Full node query performance
* Performant, high uptime public RPC and API
* Reliable, easy-to-use block explorers
* Secure data querying: proving light clients and decentralized services (e.g., The Graph)
* Ecosystem tooling
* High-quality documentation
* Kava SDKs
* Ensuring good integration with existing EVM tooling
* Chain upgrade processes
* Improved upgrade procedures for safer, faster, and more reliable upgrades
* Validator tooling for state rollbacks and faster chain syncs for those that miss upgrades.
* Bridge and cross-chain messaging security risk reduction
* Both traditional IT security of bridges but also new economic risks added from a wider range of smart contract interactions
* Wallets security and feature improvements
* User wallet security and recovery mechanisms (e.g., social recovery)
* Smart contract wallets/account abstraction
* Consensus engine decentralization and throughput
* Increase decentralization and diversity of validator set while not sacrificing throughput
* Modularize blockchain architecture (e.g., ZK rollups)
* Increase consensus security through IBC interchain security
* Consensus engine security
* Mempool improvements / MEV mitigation
* Execution engine (e.g., EVM) performance
* Improves global transaction throughput and reduces gas costs

**Who They Are.**

&#x200B;

* Akash (infrastructure)
* Axelar (bridge)
* Binance (bridge, asset issuance)
* Chainlink (oracles)
* Celer Network (Bridge)
* CertiK (core security)
* Circle (asset issuance)
* Coinbase (custody and infrastructure)
* Cosmostation (infrastructure)
* Fireblocks (custody)
* Huobi (asset issuance)
* Kava Labs (core infra and security)
* Multichain (bridge)
* … many more teams are coming with the “Infrastructure Security Rewards” launch.

**Proof-of-Stake Security (PoS)**

The Kava Blockchain is a decentralized network currently powered by Tendermint BFT consensus. Kava validators are the backbone of security for the Kava blockchain. They secure the blockchain at a PoS layer by running full nodes and participating in consensus. Validators and their delegators also participate in voting, which is essential to security in all layers.

**What They Do**

&#x200B;

* Run full nodes
* Broadcast votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by a validator’s private keys
* Commit new blocks
* Participate in governance by voting on proposals

**Who They Are**

&#x200B;

* Kraken
* Binance Staking
* Sikka
* Stake.fish
* Chorus one
* Huobi
* SG-1
* Forbole
* … 200+ Kava Validators

**Foundation Reserve Security**

The Kava Foundation Reserve exists to help secure the Kava ecosystem from financial shocks. Crypto as an industry is a highly volatile technology subject to numerous attack vectors, which may result in negative financial outcomes. The goal of the Reserve is to help mitigate risks, subject entirely to Kava governance votes.

**What They Do**

* SAFU Fund, which may assist in the case of items like bridge hacks, infrastructure hacks, protocol hacks, etc.
* Deployment of Reserve assets as liquidity into Kava protocols
* Creating a basket of assets for hedging purposes

**Who They Are**

&#x200B;

* Kava governance entirely

In the future, subject to Kava governance, part of the Foundation Reserve may be wrapped in a non-profit organization. This organization would be able to more readily execute the will of Kava governance on off-chain items like the conversion of Reserve assets into a basket that is neutral or negatively correlated with the market. This basket of assets may include assets like stablecoins, BTC, and other instruments as Kava governance deems prudent.

**Conclusion**

The Kava Foundation is a formalization of the Kava governance and community processes that have been taking place for nearly three years. The goal is to safeguard the growth of the Kava blockchain in the layers of PoS Security, Infrastructure Security, and Financial Reserve Security which work in conjunction with the Kava Rise growth engineer to make Kava the fastest growing blockchain for protocols.

As always, Kava Governance may modify this and any future initiative to continue evolving and keeping the core tenants of growth and safeguarding growth.

**About Kava**

Kava (kava.io) is a secure, lightning-fast Layer-1 blockchain that combines the developer power of Ethereum with the speed and interoperability of Cosmos in a single, scalable network."

I just saw on osmosis that the wrapped assets are on axelar so I know it’s only as safe as axelar is secure. 
I’d guess they all have a similar risk level, and I understand the asset is only as safe as the network is on, so how is it? I’ve not seen much said about axelar wrapped assets and don’t want to invest in a solana type problem

The journey of Axelar becoming official bridge for Osmosis,axelar,vmuirv,2022-06-28 14:43:09,9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/axelar/comments/vmuirv/the_journey_of_axelar_becoming_official_bridge/,chomtana001,,"Axelar has become an official bridge for Osmosis due to the combination of strong technical and community.

# Technical advantage

Axelar is the first bridge that have fully functional to support transferring from EVM chains to any Cosmos based chain. While other bridges lack generalization on Cosmos based chain.

As Axelar support any Cosmos based chain, Axelar can add Osmosis (and other Cosmos based chain) easily.

# Community

Osmosis official has conducted a vote to elect the official bridge. Many competitors have come into choices. Finally, Axelar has the most vote which indicate a strong community helping together.

As a result, Axelar won a vote conducted by Osmosis DAO to determine which bridge should become official as has already become an official Osmosis bridge.

# How can we bridge assets to Osmosis via Axelar?

Currently, you can bridge assets from any Axelar supported chains such as Ethereum, Polygon chain to Osmosis chain using Axelar Satellite.

Axelar will do the job to validate the fund locked in the source chain, mint the Axelar wrapped token on the Axelar chain and automatically IBC transfer these tokens to Osmosis chain.

# Use case of token bridged to Osmosis

After you have bridged your token for example USDC. You can start using it on Osmosis chain. The basic DApps on Osmosis chain can be found at app.osmosis.zone

Hello dear LUNAtics, I have a big problem and I kindly ask for the help.

I just found that somebody transferred $4000 from my wallet on Anchor protocol to unknown address. As you can see on the photos in comment, yesterday at (2022.04.07 21:38:48+02:00 ) I withdrew $4000 from deposited amount on Anchor protocol and 5 minutes later somebody sent these $4000 to the address which has 44 million dollars on it and which is unknown for me (terra1jkk2zscerfugj0sjlzgx0xnk2zq6nnqk04l5jr ). I can see that this address is gathering new UST amounts very fast so probably more people are loosing their money just like me.

Now I don't know what to do? Should I withdraw all the deposit and convert it from UST to some other stable coin or crypto? Can this happen again? Who can help me to get back my hard earned money? Is there anybody from Terra which can help me to solve this issue.

Thank you in advance!
