Valencia Year 2,RimWorld,1i9xccj,2025-01-25 16:19:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/1i9xccj/valencia_year_2/,SuperTaster3,Colony Showcase,"https://preview.redd.it/bylgiau5e7fe1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f64a9af5230ff1e451115cf39250702a543e6a

Valencia continues to grow! A 'pirate' enclave lead by Diana, a lady who insists she is a pirate because she has a pirate hat. A castle built on a semi-island in an oxbow river, with an anima tree on an actual island, and now spreading out to a few other regions.

The rainbow tower probably needs renovating. I tried for a sort of spiral shape, but I think the circle is just too small to do that. It would probably look better if Green's top wall was brought up flush with Red's. Right now, Red is Research, Orange is Tailoring, Yellow is Crafting/Fabrication, Green is Dining, Blue is unused, Purple is a landing spot for items, and Pink is a royal bedroom for Diana and Strange. The tower curves counterclockwise, and pink can only be reached by going around the spiral. The grey Destruction area heads out back to a geothermal and corpse zones.

[Spinnin!](https://preview.redd.it/oxo74ynue7fe1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=448d40372090bbef0eeb39f81562bc2bd6d24bd3)

The grotto up north was an Area Revealed!, and it seemed like a reasonable place to put apartments. Dunno what to do with the sand pit in the middle though, but clearly it needs to become Something recreational. Colonists don't quite seem to have a grasp of the skipgates: They'll deliver through them, but when tasked with bringing something back they'll walk the long way. Half victories, I suppose.

[This is your hole! It was made for you.](https://preview.redd.it/8hqsi8n7f7fe1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f62107172f778907a7fe9654e5f13568b2dc1d1)

Randy has been an **absolute Buttface** this year. Not just a toxic spewer, but toxic fallout afterwords that brought us down to 0 food and about 100 meals before production caught back up. About 5 raids back to back. Right as the rainbow tower went online, a herd of 33 bunny people charged in(sappers) insisting that they be allowed to play in the tower too, with their guns. The plan for devilstrand dusters to stave off the desert heat has not happened because all the plants died. The perils of having a sunroof courtyard garden.

This will become less of a problem as turrets come online, but still. Very rude. I think I've hit the maximum size I want for the colony at least: 21 adults/2 children. Ahoy has a sad bug where because he is a faun, he faints constantly at the sight of the cleaning robots. Hopefully that will get patched soon, because it's really dumb. You can see him fainted in the top picture. Just kinda falls over sometimes.

9 Psycasters, filling out the general needs. Calliope the giant spider girl(Anti Material Rifle because she's big) is slowly learning how to upgrade gear psychically. Starlight has put in skipgates around the colony, and only needs a few more levels to get the sixth and final one online. Argo continues to be a dominant sparklord despite her noncombat(mutagun) weapon. She sends the lightning, and then 'heals' the raiders at the end into 100% hp animals. A win for everyone, really.

12 Ranged, 6 Melee, 1 Mutagun, 2 Pacifist. Every colonist has their own specific weapon type, which I try to keep on them but they keep dropping their stuff when they fall over in raids. Current winner in combat is Diana, with two revolvers and a levitation implant that let her just kinda slide around the battlefield going ""pew pew pew"". Izzy has a minigun, and took the idea of an animal going manhunter with a giggle and about 20 bullets in the poor crab's direction. In general the colony is very offense oriented; armor is not as cool as having fancy weapons that they're highly skilled with. Slowly working up to proper defenses though.

I do wish pacifists could equip Thrumbo Plushies. It would be thematic and adorable.

Animals are ramping up to be Mostly Thrumbos. They're about 1/3 of the crowd, but they eat SO much that they might as well be all of them. Some camels, some buffalo, a goat named Crispin, and then various white/silver/crimson thrumbos. They have lots of trees to eat, and enjoy letting the kiddos ride on them. Notable names: Cameleon, Camelot, Mobile Sofa(buffalo), Silvant, Thrumpet, Crimbo, Thrumbone, Mrs. Potato Head(capybara),

Next goals are to get proper turrets up so that the colonists aren't running around putting out fires. Let the shore defend itself while they work on building neat buildings. Some sort of goober cathedral in the upper mountain, walls on the T bridge to make it more of a real structure, and a field hospital rather than the pseudo one we have now.

Feel free to spew thoughts and give suggestions on what can be built next. There's a lot of the map left to conquer! "
Interns Wanted: Ghosts of Saltmarsh! [D&D 2024][Online][New Player Friendly][Inclusive Table][$20/session][Paid][Mondays 7-10 CST][Ghosts of Saltmarsh],lfgpremium,1i9x9ny,2025-01-25 16:16:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfgpremium/comments/1i9x9ny/interns_wanted_ghosts_of_saltmarsh_dd/,Resident-Bar2911,,"Dive into the new 2024 rules for D&D! We'll be starting at level 1, making this a GREAT campaign for new players and veteran 5E players that are excited about the new upgrades. 

Congratulations! You’ve been recruited as interns for an adventuring company called Persona Non Grata, Inc. Working from the Saltmarsh Franchise Office, you can expect to explore the Corarane Sea and the Elizabethan Peninsula of the homebrew world of Thabreus. Saltmarsh is on the edge of the Empire, with locals frequently engaging in piracy and smuggling at odds with Imperial law. The islands hold many secrets and plots, as do the residents in and around Saltmarsh. Will you back the locals in their efforts to protect their independent (and sometimes piratical) ways? Or will you side with the Imperialists and help establish order in the Corarane? With chaos rampant, it’s a ripe opportunity for those looking to make their mark on the world!

**System**: **Dungeons and Dragons 2024**

**Schedule**: Weekly on **Mondays at 7pm CST (8 pm EST/5 pm PST)**

**Price: $20/session**, paid through StartPlaying.games. Session 0 is free.

We'll be using **Ghosts of Saltmarsh** for our campaign materials, but set in the Corarane Sea of the homebrew world of Thabreus. The campaign will be a mix of dungeon delves and nautical adventuring. There are consequences for your actions. The goal isn’t to kill the PC’s, but you should expect to have to use your wits and not just raw power to survive.

The first mission will be a test of your capabilities as fresh adventurers. If you fail, it's no loss to the company (you *did* sign the waiver). But if you succeed... you'll be welcomed into the (in)famous adventuring company Persona Non Grata, Inc.! Do ya' have the guts, bravery, and initiative to make it as a PNG Intern? Or will you end up as another lost soul on the edge of the Empire?

**What comes with your internship?**

* **New 2024 D&D Rules:** We’ll be using the new and updated ruleset these new goodies. Starting at level 1 will be a *great* way to learn them!
* **Welcoming Table:** It’s like playing a game at my own kitchen table. Everyone having fun is the primary objective, so a friendly atmosphere of collaboration is the focus.
* **Immersion into the world of Thabreus**: It’s a homebrew world that’s alive with multiple campaigns. The Corarane Region will be *your* playground, making your actions *matter* in the world. 
* **Dedicated Discord Server**: Connect with me for help if you need, or chat with the other players that roam the world of Thabreus.
* **DM Support:** I’m always available for scheduling issues, or to help you with questions about rules, the campaign, or your character.
* **Experienced DM**: I’ve run campaigns out of Saltmarsh for years. You can expect NPC’s that are alive and a part of the world. Encounters can (and will) be tweaked to provide the most amazing story possible and keep you on the edge of your seat.

**Ready to Join the (in)Famous ranks of PNG, Inc.?**

* Limited number of internships available!

I lost my favorite ship and I don't know exactly where I got it. This was a save I started for an expedition, and I know where I started the save and can see the nearby systems that I visited early on when I bought the ship at a trading post.

Can someone please verify any or all of the following about ships?

1. Each system has 21 ships, and in non-pirate systems one of the 21 is an exotic and one is a solar sailor.

2. I should be able to go back in the same save and re-purchase that same ship if I can just find the right system.

3. The systems that show as having been visited on the galaxy map should be accurate and complete (the game doesn't forget some that you've visited over time).

Thank you kind travellers!"

Hello, I've loved seeing everyone's beautiful kitties in this group and the PirateCat community! Our cat Merlin has retinal melanoma and will have his eye removed in Feb or April (we have been watching the melanoma since August 2023 and sadly, the time has come to remove the eye). (Photos show him as a kitten, relaxing and in the last one, you can see the current status of the melanoma in the last pic--his right eye.) I've gotten great input from others who went through the same with their fur baby, but I was wondering for those who had kitties with eyes removed in the past few years, did you elect to get the silicone prosthetic ball? My specialist said 450/500 kitties she worked on did get it. Initially it helps with stopping bleeding earlier because of pressure on the wound (in a good way), but not necessary for long term. The specialist said she's had zero issues with the prosthetic. Merlin will be 10 yrs in May and is a big breed so expected lifespan is 15-16 yrs (though vet told me lately he's seeing 12-13 yrs for lots of cats!! WTH?).  Thanks in advance for your feedback."

The Pirates

  
  


  
  


“We should not have sent out that scout vessel. By trying to confirm the observational powers of our opponents we only played into them and have been exposed even further. This is dangerous! We need to recall them immediately or at the very least replace them as they’re clearly growing compromised and are incapable of proper deception. We need to blur our trail and ensure that whatever intel our opponents have gathered rots immediately. It’s very plain that there is too much raw military power to simply kill them, so we must use the fact that they’re already distracted in order to lead them away. Fade away and fall into the shadows and mist, we survive by our enemies never finding us.” Admiral Fallows intones into the debate chamber with all the fervour and conviction she can muster. She’s afraid, she’s genuinely afraid. “We survive by...”

  
  


“We’re all well aware of our own tactics and doctrines thank you Admiral.” Her own superior cuts her off. Grand Admiral Longitude does not suffer fools nor frivolity. “The issue on the table is simple. So simple that the entirety of the admiralty must be here for this decision. It is unanimous or it is not to be followed. We are not now and never again shall be slaves. And so we move as one. Indivisible and incorruptible. Now good admirals. We have several decisions before us. Each a question with a simple yes or no answer. We will debate to determine the best outcome for each until such time that each decision, be it in the positive or negative, is without debate. Each shall be unanimous.”

  
  


“Which brings up the first question.” Grand Admiral Bombard says. Technically she’s the same rank as Longitude, but seniority matters. “Do we continue the observation mission on The Inevitable and it’s assets, such as Subject Mirror.”

  
  


Two hundred votes are cast. One hundred and ninety four for, two opposed, four undecided. There isn’t even supposed to be an undecided option but those uncertain seem uncertain even of that. Longtitude rubs up and down her neck with her knuckles in annoyance. “There is no room for uncertainty here ladies. All who are not for the motion are counted as against it.”

  
  


“Now we...”

  
  


A musical tone chimes through the chamber and everyone freezes.

  
  


“Who’s is that?” Grand Admiral Longitude demands as the tone rings again. “WHO HAS COMPROMISED US!?”

  
  


“Hello? Oh hello! I think this is the right place! All those mysterious shadows blocking your lovely pastel scales! Hello? There is reception right? Can you talk back? Hellooooo?!” The tone is deep and playful, the voice of a man. “Is anyone going to talk to me? Or has my voice done that again? It IS funny, but it shouldn’t happen through a weak little... oh here we go! I’m getting a signal back and... hmm that’s bad equipment. Anyways! Hello lovely ladies! I am Salsharin! Nagasha Primal of Love and I’m talking to you to dispel a few fears you might have. Mostly in that the fact you were tiptoeing around and trying to keep each other safe means you’re safe from me. I’m no ones enemy and by proving you can care for each other means you’re someone in my book, meaning no enemy of mine! Anyways I’m sure you adorable little things have a lot to talk about, so I just want to say, Welcome to the Galaxy! We’re glad to have you! Now have a nice day now! Ta ta dear children!”

  
  


The silence following that message is utterly deafening. The sound of one of them lightly clearing her throat seems to outright echo.

  
  


“How?” Longitude asks. “Even if the Primal had run into the scout ship... how did he do it? How does one do that!? How... how did he so thoroughly hack our ship without alerting anyone? How did he get our access codes and coordinates without any warning? There are so many safeguards that even if he fully subverted the crew we’d have warning.”

“Oh don’t worry, I haven’t subverted anyone.” Salsharin assures them.

  
  


“I thought you left!”

  
  


“I wanted too but you’re just so interesting! I couldn’t help it!”

  
  


“Where even are you!? How are you doing this?”

  
  


“I’m on the outside of the adorable little ship you sent those girls on. I saw the energy they were using and it’s frequencies. I just copied them and here I am!”

  
  


“How...”

  
  


“Even Primals need the occasional upgrade darling. I have all sorts of wonderful and useful implants. Granted several of them make sure that I can tone it down on occasion. It can be hard to be so handsome.”

  
  


“I’m sure.” Longitude says dryly. “Well ladies it’s clear we can’t continue our debate in this chamber as it’s now compromised. I will be writing down where we go next and it will be passed around until we all know.”

  
  


“Oh don’t be like that! I only want to help, speaking of what’s a good pickup location for you?”

  
  


“What?”

  
  


“Well you’re in hiding so you don’t want me going to you, but I want to send you a care package so you can support yourselves better before unveiling yourself to the galaxy at large and starting to trade. So I need to know where you’d like to pick up my gift.” Salsharin says in a gushing tone.

  
  


“... We will send the coordinates later through our agents.”

  
  


“Wonderful! Thank you for accepting, it’s an excellent first step to being an accepted and appreciated part of the wider galaxy! I’m so glad you’re willing to take it! Anyways, I’m really going now! Bye bye darlings!”

  
  


“How does he know our language? And how did he speak it without an accent?” Admiral Fallows asks.

  
  


“An excellent question among many, many others Admiral Fallows. But before we debate anything we need to change location. I don’t trust the man to not listen in.”

The fire hadn’t spread fast enough and Jake had moved to intercept. His feet crash down onto the head of the invisible monster, crushing it and exposing the green gunk that is it’s internals ot the wider world. He doesn’t stop. He grabs the mother and egg and races forward and away from the swarm. Jump to the side of a building, jump to a building opposite. Then a massive back flip, carrying both the terrified Pavorous and her large egg safely through the air to land back on the flying platform he had been on.

  
  


“Hey big guy, you’re not up for election, you’re a noble. You don’t need to make yourself look that good.” His gunner protests and he scoffs even as he puts the woman down. Her legs are jelly so he sits her down on the middle of the platform.

  
  


“Oh please, I’m not trying to look good. I am good.” Jake counters smugly.

  
  


“Dial it back big man, this girl’s already taken.”

  
  


“It’s why I feel safe dialing it up. I can be myself without some random girl deciding I need to be between the sheets. It’s flattering, but it’s also not the time.” Jake replies.

  
  


“Oh please, you’re a show off to the core.”

  
  


“No, if I was a show off I’d ask you to repeat yourself to the microphone.” He says suddenly flexing his right arm so it bulges and brings it close. “Mind repeating that?”

  
  


She does not answer.

  
  


“Thought not.” Jake says before giving the bulging bicep a kiss. “No one knows what to say to the microphone.”

  
  


“Muh... micro is right. You been slacking off?” She asks him with a dusting of pink on her cheeks.

  
  


“Hah! There we go! That’s much better.” Jake says before his communicator starts lighting up. “Excuse me.”

  
  


“Baron Morgan here.” He says before listening and then nodding. “Alright. Okay, that makes sense. I’ll get it started.”

  
  


“Get what started?” His gunner asks as he starts to open a channel to the other platforms. He grins at her.

  
  


“Everyone! We’re nearly done here, the big snake is making a sweep through all settlements world wide with Baron Smith to mass destroy the Slaughter Swarm. Prepare for a massive Axiom Surge! Land your platforms if you don’t think you can ride it out.” Jake calls out to everyone as he brings his platform down. “And especially land them if you got civvies with you. They don’t have the balance or training to properly brace themselves.”

  
  


All over platforms start to lower and Jake puts on a visor to look around. He then draws his pistol and shoots a creature that can’t be seen directly in the head. It falls to the ground without even a screech and then fades into view.

  
  


“How deep do these infestations go? How are they so stealthy and res... oh... oh they’re not attacking they’re hunting. When they’re full they breed or wander. Spreading the damage subtly.” Jake realizes before there is a presence in the Axiom that even he can sense and he turns. There’s at least two blocks of buildings in the way before a wave of POWER rises through the city and there is a warning blare from his platform. Expected energy levels at two thousand percent and climbing. He deactivates it to prevent any possible overloading and moves his hand through the air as the Axiom grows so thick it’s almost tangible. Then the levels start to drain away and it thins again. Like a tidal wave just passed.

  
  


“So was that more Frankie Boy or the big snake?” Jake wonders.

“And then for a bit everything went really really weird and I just felt so angry all of a sudden. It was so weird! Apparently it was an attack from this Mother Massacre lady thing and then BOOM! It was done. Mostly because we were really really lucky in that some of the guys were already pretty much there. But it was bad! My little babies started fighting each other and it made me so mad I wanted to hit them! I never wanted to hit them before and I never want to want to hit them!” Jingay recounts.

  
  


“I see.” Observer Wu says. His glasses are no longer showing his eyes but reflecting the immensely candid Nagasha. Her mindset and recall of things might be simple, but there is nothing in the way of artifice and she’s glad to explain anything in exhaustive detail. “And did the men tell you what it did to them?”

  
  


“Yeah! It was aweful even if their brains are built different! They all ended up in hell!”

  
  


“Excuse me?”

  
  


“Well they said it was like being in hell. It was where everything they were afraid of came to life and twisted the way they saw and felt and understood things. Apparently Victor thought he was being attacked by something called Baba Yaga? And Lu... or was it Ryu? One of them felt themselves rot in the halls of dishonour and the other was in the hell of needles! Oh! And uh... one of them thought he was burning and there was brimstone and acid and screaming demons and and... oh! Franklin! He talked about his! He used Axiom to try and break out and just reset it around the same idea! He’s afraid of being controlled so he was like a puppet and a program and a robot!” Jingay less explains and more gushes as the whole story comes out in a hurry.

  
  


“So this effect that made you really angry made them all hallucinate that they were in some kind of hell?”

  
  


“Yeah! Franklin even talked a lot about what his meant. He’s afraid of losing control of himself! He’s like a really powerful Adept and he knows it and is scared that he might just something go fwoosh and be gone!” Jingay explains.

  
  


“Is he now?”

  
  


“Yeah! Did you know he put his hand print on the core of one of the gas worlds? He teleports satellites all over the system to use for defence. We turn them on and they blow through their ice shields to show up all over the place and BAM! The bad girls get hit by a hundred different frequency lasers from a hundred different places and melt!”

  
  


“This whole system is a trap?”

  
  


“No it’s a nice place to live, but we set up all sorts of hidden weapons in case something really big shows up. No one likes being outgunned, but if you hide your guns them someone might think they’re clever and show themselves to be greedy and stupid.” Jingay says before titling her head. “Or at least that’s what mom said and Captain said it was a smart thing. So I guess it’s true. It seems silly to me. If someone wants to take something they just take it right?”

  
  


“Some will try, but if they see it might hurt them a lot to take it then they won’t.” Observer Wu says as he wonders how to explain risk assessment to the woman in front of him. Or if he even should.

  
  


“Oh... uh... okay. Uh... what were we talking about?”

  
  


“Mother Massacre had used something terrible to turn everyone but the humans really angry, but the humans were instead seeing things that they feared really badly. What happened next?” Observer Wu asks.

  
  


“Oh! Well there was a boom as they blew up the machine making it all happen and then they got really angry and scrambled everyone they could help to scan every factory on the world to see if she was hidden there. They found a bunch of them and started hitting them all, one after the other with Franklin on a warpath! Looking to hit her as hard with as much Axiom as he can! She had a really trytite heavy body though so she had powerful resistances. But he showed her that there’s a weakness to trytite! It’s only as tough as iron and BAM! He ate all her Axiom and ripped out her hard drive when she tried to delete herself to escape!”

  
  


“... A robotic killing machine designed to break the people of entire worlds tried to commit suicide to escape him?”

  
  


“Yeah! And he ripped out her hard drive with his bare hand to stop her from escaping into deletion! Neat right?”

  
  


“That’s one word for it.” Observer Wu says as he vaguely imagines explaining to an entire world that sequence of events. “They really, really dialed it back when they were explaining things...”

  
  


“Hunh?” Jingay asks.

  
  


“Nothing to worry about. Just my personal problems. Now, what happened after Mother Massacre was dealt with?”

Newest Spanish treasure!,pirates,1i9wxgt,2025-01-25 16:00:55,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wxgt,TheBlackSpotGuild,,"A beautiful genuine Spanish cob I got today! A 1701 ""pillars and waves"" from the Potosi mint.
A previous owner shined it up and I love it. 
Remember, shining cobs like this up a bit does little to nothing to the actual value of the cob, just sometimes the perceived value. Meaning, this coin is still worth the same amount as before it was polished. It might just be picked up by a different audience. Some people like them polished, some people like them with the natural aging. Both will pay roughly the same for it.
Now, this doesn't apply for the extremely rare cobs from famous wrecks etc. Those you want to keep as original as possible so they match their certificates of authenticity. If you super polish a rare cob and it no longer matches the accompanying cert, it could be hard to resell it. 
And you do want to be careful polishing it so well that you loose all the background patina, as that does make it harder to make out the details, and that too may make it resell for a bit less. By all means, polish them up; just be careful going so hard that you actually remove detail.
I just can't get enough of these. I truly am a treasure-obsessed pirate! 
Pirate on!

How much should I charge for these?,Artists,1i9wrlk,2025-01-25 15:53:57,10,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wrlk,Any_pencil_1573,,"

I'm posting some of my old artworks on Reddit. I'm 17 now, and I drew the alligator in 2020, while the others were from 2021. It's been two years since I last worked on pieces like these because I've been busy studying.

I'm from Assam, and I used to take portrait commissions back then. But honestly, no one ever paid me more than $10 for them, which still makes me feel bad. Each portrait took more than a week to complete, and I always felt they should be worth at least $50. But when I see other artists' posts on Reddit, I feel like my alligator piece alone should be priced at $150(in my opinion for an unknown artist 🤡) .

The pirate ship is my favorite piece, and it took me more than a month to complete. I used a very thin sheet of paper because I couldn’t find good gsm paper that big(almost 1.5x2ft) at the time. Now, due to Assam’s humidity, the surface is no more flat, so I might not be able to sell the original. Also, have you noticed the yellow eye? 👀

I took the reference photos for the ship and the bird from Pixabay, which provides free-to-use images. Would selling these artworks be an issue since they were based on those photos?

Selling locally isn’t really an option here, so I might start selling online after my exams in March. I had an Instagram account but deleted it. Etsy is no longer available for new users in India, so I’m looking for better ways to find genuine international buyers who will appreciate the effort behind my work.

Artists, how much do you think these artworks should be worth? And what platforms should I consider for selling?

recently i haven’t been going because one of the members (white belt) goes to hard, cranks heels hooks, usually just cranks my neck in a head and arm instead of trying to finish it properly, piratic so you’ll get hit and hair pulled. He’s been talked to… 

It became especially bad when i won a gold medal at a tournament, he made it very obvious he wasnt going to lose in any aspect on the mat with me after that. 

He’s also always injured so rolling against him almost always goes wrong because he gets a ouchie.

Getting sick of it, it’s hard to avoid someone in a small gym. please give me advice maybe dirty things to do or annoying things during rolling."

Like, if his dream was to throw the biggest party in the world, wouldn’t we have already heard about it, considering how massive an achievement that would be? 

Also, I’m not sure how I’d feel if Luffy’s dream had already happened before. It would be better if Roger succeeded in becoming the Pirate King but failed to achieve this other dream, while Luffy managed to achieve both."

I have browsed this sub but couldn't find an answer.

I will stay in Hakone for 3 days, and I would like to see the usual (Owakudani, pirate ship cruise, Hakone shrine and old cedar avenue, Gora park, Hakone museum of art).

I have considered these cities but received mixed opinions:

- Hakone-Yumoto (they said there's not much to do)

- Gora (same as above)

- Ashigarashimo district

- Hakone, zone near Hakone Checkpoint 

- Motohakone

Considering that it is not a day trip but a 3-days stay, where would be best to stay? At the end of my stay, I will have to go back to Odawara to take the train to Kyoto.

I also have motion sickness and I see that I need to take a bus that goes 1 hour uphill to go back to Odawara... Is it so?

Also, is it better a clockwise or anti-clockwise tour in my cass?

Thanks!!"

Conquest Jan 20th-24th,CarnivalCruiseFans,1i9v7k4,2025-01-25 14:44:52,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1i9v7k4/conquest_jan_20th24th/,anxious_labturtle,📝 Trip Report,"This was my boyfriend and I’s first cruise! We honestly came out with 0 expectations. We read a lot of poor reviews online and we only paid $850 for a balcony room so if it was great we paid $850 and if it was bad, well we only paid $850 and we were still on a boat in the ocean. We did pay $200 for wifi and we bought the bubbles package but not the cheers. 

We had the best time! I’m a planner and I decided to just go with the flow this vacation. I did minimal research, like mostly what to bring, what to do on land and how to get on/off the boat. We did a lot of trivia, we won $605 at bingo, we won $30 at deal or no deal for free play at the casino, we went to all the talks from the cruise director who was Savannah, and she was amazing and fun! We went to all the shows, the comedy shows, the live shows, the dining room shows, every thing we could watch in the theatre we went to, even like the disembarkation talk. 

The good 
• the food - the only food we had that wasn’t great was the buffet. We ate at all the free restaurants. We ate at the dining room every night. We had breakfast and sea day brunch. We had guy’s burgers, bar b Que, and the blue iguana taco place. We had pizza pirate. We didn’t have Sushi, the deli, the seafood shack, or the steak place. Basically we only ate free food. Since we won bingo and we had free $600 to spend we drank more than we probably would have. 

•the entertainment - the 80s show is kind of cheesy but the performers are really good. Love and Marriage was so funny. We played a lot of trivia and I tied with someone on Harry Potter trivia and I’m still mad I didn’t get the plastic ship. We love bingo and it’s expensive. We probably wouldn’t have paid $350 for it like we did if we hadn’t of won money at the $5000 bingo but it was fun. Our comedians were also actually funny. They didn’t repeat shows either. We went 3 times and we laughed at all shows. Even the lame 80s party was fun on the deck and we danced and acted silly because why not? 

•Ports - half moon cay was amazing. If it was 10 degrees warmer it would’ve been better but we laid out for about 4 hours in the beach and then got back on the boat. At Nassau we had a swim with the turtle excursion planned but because it was cold we cancelled it and walked around to the Queen’s staircase, Señor Frogs, and the Pirate Museum. Yeah there was a lot of people selling stuff at us but we just said no thank you and they left us alone. 

•The people - everyone on the boat was so nice. Ricardo was our room steward and he was the sweetest. The fun squad people were also so fun. Our waiters in the dining room were amazing. We ate in both because of having our time dining and going to breakfast and everyone was so nice. We had a weird charge come up on our account and guest services just removed it in 12 hours. 

The bad 

• our room - we had a balcony in the middle of the ship on the 6th floor. It was 6279. I picked it because I get really car sick and I was so scared of being sea sick. It was clean and Ricardo took great care of the rooms and hallway but it was small and the bed was so hard. The towels are also small and not as soft. We fully expected this and understand we’re on a smaller and older of the cruise ships but the first thing we both did when we got home was take a shower in our shower. Also, everyone says it but the A/C. The balcony was also not very large which again is to be expected. It’s also kind of scary when you’re out at sea and you look down. 

•the midnight buffet - we were really excited for 24 hour pizza and instead we had buffet until 2 and pizza till midnight. The midnight buffet was very lacking. It was buffet food. 

Overall - I’m worried we’ve become cruisers. We had a 5 day vacation that was minimal planning. We got good entertainment and we feel like we got a lot of value for our money. We read online about how trashy carnival was and we didn’t experience this at all. There was no fighting, no drugs, and everyone just genuinely having a good time. Every time we went to something, even if we just went to people watch, we had fun. I also didn’t expect the food to be so good and it was very good. We’re trying to plan another one for next year and go on a longer cruise on one of the newer boats. We definitely didn’t expect this to be as good of a vacation as it was. "

Starfarers Duels - all three opened and retaped??,Catan,1i9uor5,2025-01-25 14:22:13,0,0.5,2,https://i.redd.it/8kvdqyijx6fe1.jpeg,hauszenfeffer,,"Am I crazy?  I ordered starfarers duels for my son’s birthday.  The first one (not pictured) came and the box was ragged, and looked to have been opened and retaped.

So I returned that to Amazon and got an exchange.  The second one had the box fine but it was still like the one pictured above, north and and south tape seals broken, east and west seals also broken but retaped with bigger tape. 

So I figured this second one was returned used also, so I exchanged it AGAIN (lol) - cuz it’s a gift.. and the third one just arrived (pictured) and it’s the same thing.  North and south tape seals broken, east and west original seals broken, retaped with bigger tape. 

So I ask, is this some sort of known manufacturing issue where the publishers or distributors or whatever forgot to include a piece or something, ended up having to open them all, put the piece in, then reseal??

Thank you!  Just don’t want to return a third one if this is the best I’m gonna get anyway.. thank you fellow catan lovers!"

Many people doubted me but it’s there! It’s a free website officially under Disney so if you don’t like pirating, there’s a good place to watch the new episode before it premiers on Disney+. 

I’m not sure how long it’ll be on the site so watch it soon!"

[TOMT][GAME][MOBILE][2010s] Strange 3D mobile game where you knock down weird orange pillar people.,tipofmytongue,1i9ucxe,2025-01-25 14:08:05,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1i9ucxe/tomtgamemobile2010s_strange_3d_mobile_game_where/,BubMythikal,Open,"A while back ago (likely around 2014-2015, but I'm certain it was between the early to mid 2010s) I had a tablet with a bunch of different games, but one of the games I remember playing a lot was this really poorly made 3D game similar to angry birds, where you played as a pirate ship with a cannon which faced an island. 

The goal of the game was to shoot these tall, orange/brown pillar like creatures and knock them off the island into the water with your limited cannon shots. The pillar creatures, iirc, had no limbs or features besides a pair of eyes, resembling googly eyes. They may have also had angry eyebrows.

A feature of the game which I can vividly remember was when you started a level, it gave you a quick 360 view of the island so you could see all the creatures and have a chance to strategize. The island was also completely square in almost every level. I believe the game also had a bit of audio, including constantly playing ocean sfx, and I'm pretty sure there was a punch sound when hitting an enemy. If an enemy was hit into the water, there was also a splash sound effect. There may have also been a few obstacles, such as palm trees which were on the island. This is pretty much as far as my memory goes with this game. Hopefully someone else remembers something like it. "

[This is how John should look like more or less btw, for this episode I'm gonna put some images to you to imagine how the OCs look like, I decided to use a different design for John than the first one that I thought of because O think that this fits better what I imagine but I can't draw because I draw like a 2 yeard old :D](https://preview.redd.it/rj11us3mr3fe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=439ff8f8b52405cb8beb3271ffa7ea4c6c7022f5)

John: What? Strong?...\*Starts to think for some seconds, but he finally snaps out of it and asks a logical question\* What kind of question is that anyways?

Ryu: Just answer!

John; Ugh I'm...\*Thinks for some seconds again\* I suppose that I am...somewhat strong, look I have to go fast.

\*...Silence...was left thanks to a vision of hope that impressed everyone...a superheroine appeared...something that on this world was only a dream...became true...\*

Old man: That girl...

Police officer: What's going on?

Kid: Mom! Is that a Kamen Rider?!

Mom: I...don't know...

Female news reporter: \*On a helicopter trying her best in order to warn everyone about this situation...\* We're reporting something unbelievable...it seems that...a Tokusatsu monster and heroines has appeared on real life...we don't know exactly how this has happened, but we want anyone to know that get closer to this area could be potentially dangerous, this is not a joke nor a dream...the authorities are already doing their best to evacuate the area...

Sora: Aqua...please...

[This is how Sora looks like more or less](https://preview.redd.it/dq2xtifjx3fe1.jpg?width=254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6e331761ef25b33a0231827cbaad7e0ab4739a7)

Aqua: Sorry Sora...but it seems...that I'm the only one that can do this...or at least that's what I think, if I'm honest with you, now that I'm more calm, I'm still completely lost on what's going on and I can't believe that this isn't a dream, I mean, this is so weird and I didn't even thought that much about if this belt was going to work on me but oh well...

[This is how Aqua should look like more or less under the armor, but for now I don't have an image to put an example of the armor, sorry...](https://preview.redd.it/3euz2fjvx3fe1.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d019542fb839d4967ed285fccbe5727fc464e461)

\*While this was happening, a nearly brave police officer used the chance to finally run at Sora before Shin and Aqua could start their fight\*

Police officer: Please miss, we have to go, we need to evacuate all the people around

Sora: But...but...

Aqua: Go, Sora, I don't want you and other people to get injured, I'll deal with this...

Sora: Aqua....

Shin: ...How? \*Staring directly at Aqua...\* How someone like you could have got to use that Driver? I already know why my weak daughter was unable to do it...but why can YOU do it?

[This Another Build, so this is Shin transformed if someone didn't knew](https://preview.redd.it/0avlwmm6y3fe1.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=721d6d18f87f95c4666eb5a8224f67d7676947ee)

Aqua: Hey! Don't call her weak! \*Aqua got angry and finally started to to run and Shin...this was it...a superhero in real life...her debut...each step was strong...they even left marks on the floor...she felt strong...it was like with each second she became stronger and stronger...it was great...like a dream come true...then she finally kicked Shin...a kick of justice!...but...\*

Shin: How disappointing...\*Shin easily stopped Aqua's kick...\* I had to admit, I genuinely got scared for a moment...but...it seems that...you just got to transform...but not to use its full potential...it was something that I should've foreseen honestly...\*punches Aqua on the gut and then starts to unleash a combo of attacks on her...\*

Sora: N-no...Aquaaaaaa! \*Sora was just getting more and more stressed with each second of watch her best friend getting beaten by her father while the police officer helped her to get up and run to another place even thought Sora's insistence to stay...and she wasn't the only one stressed, the people around that was watching the situation while running and the people that was watching it on the news were also getting nervous after watch how what looked like a light of hope after the appearance of a real fictional creature...what looked like a superheroine was getting beaten completely by the monster, with she being almost unable to answer...however...Aqua wasn't going to stop so easy...\*

Aqua: Fuck...\*Aqua tries to counterattack, but due to the inexperience, she's unable to completely control the speed and strength of her attacks, however, the attacks this time haves good power and some of them manage to actually impact Shin thanks to Aqua's own abilities to fight and martial arts and also, they cause damage on the scientist, leaving him genuinely surprised and angry but it is still noticiable that her attacks still lacking a lot of control...\* Yeah...I'm starting to feel it...this is...really strong!

Shin: You...don't get so cocky just because some good attacks, Hikari...You're still not reaching half of what that Driver can do!

Aqua: Yeah yeah whatever, take this! \*Aqua tries to attack Shin again...but it was a mistake...her inexperience keeps showing off and she ended up not only easily dodged by Shin, but also the strength of her attack destroyed a close hydrant around there\* What?!

Shin: Bold of you to assume that someone like you would control that kind of power like that \*Shin started to counterattack Aqua with a combo of punches...\*

Aqua: You...better don't underestimate me! \*Aqua was send backwards by one of Shin's punches, however, she quickly catches up and tries to run at Shin...but again, she's unable to control very well her powers and ends up going too fast.\* Ahhhhh! \*And accidentally, she crashes against a nearly wall...and for make things worst, Shin summons a gun and starts to shot at Aqua.\*

Sora: Aqua!!!!!!! \*She screamed in despair while Aqua was in pain on the floor...\*

Shin: See? I told you. You got to use it, not to control it.

Aqua: Dammit...this is...way harder to control than what I thought...

Sora: Please! Father! S-Stop!

Shin: Shut up already...I was thinking about having a father and daughter discussion...but I think that I should just get rid of you...\*Shin shot Aqua some more times to make sure that she doesn't gets up to then run extremely fast and Sora and the police officer...it looked...like the end...but suddenly...Shin was stopped...\* What?...

Aqua: You...are not going to hurt them...\*His armor started to shine in blue and red.\*

Shin: You...better stay quiet, unless that you want me to take that Driver already \*Slaps Aqua, making her to fall on the ground while Sora and the police officer already ran away...\*

Aqua: \*As she started to get up quickly in order to not let Shin go away again\* Sorry...but I can't let you do that...as I said before...I'm still pretty confused...everything has happened extremely fast...but I know something...I cannot let you got this Driver...you'll have to take it from my dead body!

Shin: \*Sigh\* Why are you so invested on this? You're just a random girl that befriended my daughter, you shouldn't be here on first place! \*Uses the gun to start to shoot multiple times at Aqua again.\*

Sora: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! \*Sora started to  run at them.\*

Police officer: Miss! Wait! \*The police ran behind Sora trying to stop her...\*

Aqua: \*Receiving all the shoots but not falling even though the pain, she then started to run at Shin and punch him, but again, it looks useless as Shin easily dodges all of the impacts and then punches her on the face and then strikes her in the gut with his knee.\* Agh...

Sora: Please, stop! Stop!!!!! \*Shin just points his gun at her, but Aqua reacts fast and gets in the way, receiving more shots in order to protect her friend...\*

Sora: No...no...please...Aqua...just...

Aqua: ...No...I'm going to...protect you always...what do you plan to do?...this isn't like you, Sora....you're...so bright...you should know what you should be doing in this moment instead of just keep yelling...don't worry...I'll make sure that you'll be alright...you're my friend after all...remember? When we first met up...I promised to protect you always...that's what friends do for other friends...\*Her armor suddenly starts to shine in multiple colors...\*

Sora: Aqua... \*She started to remember the first time that she meet her friend...both were kinda outcasts on school, they were not so unpopular nor bullied, so they never got neither positive or negative attention for anyone on school, even thought some students empathised with Aqua's hard family situation...while in Sora's case...she was a mystery...she came out seemingly out of nowhere...her family didn't talked to anyone...she was just almost completely alone in school....so they didn't have many friends or even bullies either...but Aqua started to become more popular because one day she started to act more...alive, and all the people around, including teachers some times...and one day...\*

\*Flashback...\*

Aqua: \*Talking through her cell phone.\* yeah, I'm heading towards home now, don't worry, I'll call you if something happens, okey, see ya \*At this time, Aqua was 16 and she was just starting to overcome something horrible...her parents died in a horrible accident and she, as a little child, even got to unfortunately see their bodies...however, with time, and some help, she was starting to feel better...more happy and bright...she was starting to genuinely smile again...and also, as it was mentioned before, she finally started to become more popular on school because she started to help a lot of her classmates and that kindness started to make her somewhat loved by the people on her school...however, she was still trying to overcome her trauma and she still had some problems...but that wasn't going to stop her to help someone...she stayed before school just to help some students and teachers with some problems that she pretty often helped too since her change of attitude...and this lead to help another person this day...\*

Boy: Hey\~

Sora: \*Sigh\* Are you two going to stop already? \*Due to her curiosity, Aqua roll her head to see what was going on, and she watched Sora getting harassed by two guys...\*

Boy 2: You look kinda cute for a nerd you know\~?

Sora: I think that I told you both to stop

Aqua: (Isn't that...that girl Naruki that is a prodigy and the teachers even tell her that she shouldn't even go to school anymore?) \*Aqua thought while she started to get worried by Sora's safety...\*

Boy: C'mon, we aren't gonna do one of that cliches in movies when we're just flirting at you because we want you to make our homework, we really think that you're pretty hot\~

Sora: I didn't asked, and I told you that I'm not interested, please, stop \*Sora tried to leave but one of the boy's grabbed her arm and pulled her.\*

Boy 2: Look, we just want some fun\~maybe you even would find it good, don;t you think?

Sora: please, let me go \*Sora tried to free her arm but she was just to weak to do it...\*

Boy: C'mon, we'll show you, trust us, you'll enjoy it\~

Sora: \*Starting to get more anxious.\* No...please...

Aqua: HEY! \*All three of them stared at Aqua.\* I don't think that flirt like that is the right way to flirt, guys \*she said with an angry face.\*

Boy: Uh? Oh\~you're that Aqua girl right? It seems that we're lucky now bud, we got two cute girls.

Boy 2: Yeah, oi! Hikari, wanna join us-? \*Suddenly Aqua kicked him on the gut, making him to kneel down in pain.\*

Aqua: Sorry, I'm not interested.

Boy: Bro! \*Then before he could do something, Aqua just punched him on the face.\*

Aqua: You know...I think that the principal is still around here...\*kicks them some times again to make sure that they don't get up.\* Wanna go to the principal's office with me, Naruki?

Sora: ...H-how do I know that I can trust you?\*

Aqua: I supposed that you'll say that...oh well \*cof\* \*cof\* Mister Nageshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!! \*She screamed extremely high the name of the principal, even leaving Sora impressed\*

Sora: You-

Aqua: Yeah, I know how to scream really high, I practiced that too.

Principal Nageshi: What's going on here?! \*The principal stopped impressed at the scene...\* Hikari! What happened here?

[This is more or less Principal Nageshi](https://preview.redd.it/0dr8y2d2q4fe1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f74d7d05851498582dc7e0c3d836864ee0691fb)

Aqua: Oh good, you were fast, I have some interesting things to tell you

\*After that, Aqua told to the director what happened and Sora also talked, and not only that, but Aqua also showed some photos a little clips of audio that she took on her phone, and if this wasn't enough, the Principal decides to also check out the security cameras and he saw everything, so the boys received they deserved punishment...\*

\*And after that...\*

Aqua: Man, I hope my family to not get worried for me...

Sora: ...Thank you, Hikari.

Aqua: Huh? Oh, Don't worry Naruki, I like to help \*Said with a kind smile a giving her a thumbs up.\*

Sora: ...Okey...

Aqua: And how do you feel? Are you alright like, emotionally?

Sora: Oh, don't worry, I'll be alright...

Aqua: ...Hey, if you need to talk to someone, you can come to me, okey? I promise that I'll protect you. \*Said for then do this:\*

https://i.redd.it/q40jqgdqg4fe1.gif

Sora: ...What?

Aqua: Well, that's what a hero does right? Protect people, and also, that's what friends do to other friends.

Sora: ...We're...friends?

Aqua: Maybe, I mean, we just meet but if you want, we can hang out sometimes \*Said with a bright smile.\*

Sora: Ah...\*Sora struggled for a moment, but then...\* S-sorry...I...I don't want friends okey? You look like a great person...but I can't, trust me, you don't want to be my friend...\*tries to leave, but then...\*

Aqua: ...Are you sure about that? A friend can help you to deal with the hard times \*Sora stopped for a moment...\* Naruki...if you have some problem...\*Aqua open her arms\* I'll take it with you!

Sora: ...You...just meet me...you...don't need to take anything...\*Sora reluctantly tries to leave again...\*

Aqua: Just because I just meet you doesn't means that I'm gonna leave a person alone like that, and also, if we become friends, we're not gonna be strangers anymore, and I'll be there for you! \*Sora stopped once more...\*

Sora: ...Hikari....please...I...\*Sora thought for a moment...\* I...I...I...

Aqua: Look, I'll not force you to anything, I'm not like those assholes from before...but I want you to know that there are people that are gonna be there for you, you just have to find them. \*After heard that...Sora stopped for a moment...and...she started to cry...\* Uh? Naruki! Are you alright?!

Sora: Y-yes...please...leave me alone now...

Aqua: ...No...I'll be here for you...I'll take this with you! Because as I said...even if we just meet...I want to help you! I'm not gonna leave anyone alone ever!

Sora: H-Hikari...you..are...so...stubborn...I...suppose that...I'm not going to convince you...

Aqua: Nope, cry as much as you want, I'm here, we can go home later, tell me, do you want go out for something?

Sora: \*Struggled to answer...but this time..for this time...she finally heard...her heart...\* Yeah...that...would be nice. \*Aqua smiled at her and went to hang out with Sora...\*

\*End of the flashback...\*

Aqua: And I'm...not gonna only protect you...I'll protect...that police officer too...and all the other people too! \*Her armor starts to shine again, this time with red, blue, golden and purple colors...\*

Shin: What?...grr...how corny...stay quiet already, Hikari! \*Turns the gun into a sword drill for then start to slash Aqua with it, but finally, Aqua was able to catch up again a little and dodge the attacks for then kick Shin on the chest, stopping his attacks momentarily, and Aqua used this chance to start to beat him without giving him a chance to react and actually dealing some good damage again like before, but this time more controlled!\*

Aqua: Yeah...yeah...my body...feels more easy to control...it is still...weird...but I think...that I can control it this time!

Shin: Dammit...this...can't be....you're finally unleashing its potential...as you said...your body should be starting to get used to it...and the will to protect my daughter and those people must be playing a big role here...

Aqua: Shut your mouth already! \*Her right punch gets involved into a blue fire for then punch Shin with it, causing even more damage than before!\* Whoa! yeah! I definitely feel like I can't lose now!

Shin: Agh...incredible...the Driver...is a success...however...isn't enough to beat me...

Aqua: I told you to shut the fuck up already! \*Starts to run extremely fast at Shin again for unleash another combo of fists, this time with all of them involved on blue fire, causing more damage to the distorted Rider.\*

Shin: Also...you're surprisingly stronger than what I thought...I genuinely underestimated you...but...\*Shin manages to stop Aqua's left punch with some difficulties and getting a little affected by the fire.\* I've already made so much effort to lost at this point against a tomboyish brat! \*Starts to counterattack slashing and stabbing Aqua multiple times, causing everyone and specially Sora to get worried again.\*

Aqua: Agh!...you...do you...think that I care about that?! All that effort is worthless if you're gonna be an asshole!

Shin: \*Kicking Aqua in the gut\* You're also more annoying than what I thought...I suppose that you were so worthless yourself that I didn't even realized that part of you until now, I suppose that I should finish this already...\*the scientist pulls out two of the bottles that he created before and literally eat them for then start to pull the lever of his belt as the bottles on it changed their colors for a moment...\*

Aqua: Oh no...here it comes...

Another Build Driver: **Swimmer! Keisatsukan!** \*Suddenly, Shin literally enters inside the floor like if it was water and starts to win in it extremely fast and using any chance to punch Aqua and then return to inside the floor without giving any chance to her to catch up, and even going for Sora and other people around  that was still trying to evacuate on purpose, knowing that Aqua was just going to run and protect them receiving all the damage herself...then he uses one moment to finally get out of the floor and start to literally tase her\*

Sora: I told you before...please...STOP!!!!!

Police Officer: Miss...

Shin: You should heard my daughter's advice...just give up now and everything is going to be less painful for you both...there's no use to keep fighting...you could never domain a power like that...give up now!

Aqua: ...About what you said before...Yeah...you're right...I just happened to get on this situation...I have already repeated that I don't even know what's going on twice if you didn't heard...but I know something...you're hurting p

eople...including my best friend that is also your daughter...and I don't like that...so yeah...I'm maybe a completely fucking random for you...but I don't need to be a chosen one to kick your ass! \*Her body starts to shine in multiple colors again.\*

Shin: I'm getting tired of this! Die already! \*Keeps tasering her while also attack her with his sword...but Aqua...keeps up...\*

Aqua: I'm...not giving up so easy!!!!! \*She finally punches Shin with her punch involved on blue fire and the impact is enough to stop Shin's attack, and even though the pain that she feels, Aqua doesn't stops and yet again starts to attack Shin without stopping any second as her body keeps shining...\* I correct what I said before...this time...I feel that I truly have the winning formula and that I cannot lose! \*Aqua keeps attacking him without stopping and making sure to not give Shin any chance to regain control, she knows that let him attack her like before again's just going to make her extremely weak, so she's not going to let him to keep hurting and scaring people...her attacks are not stop while her armor keeps shining and her breath gets more agitated.\*

Shin: You...are...not going to beat me! \*Shin manages to get in the floor again, but this time, Aqua in this frenzy state manages to counter each one of his attacks, when he tried to attack Sora and other people around again, then finally, Aqua impacted Shin's jaw with her knee, forcing him to get out of the floor and roll on the ground in pain...\* No...no...this...Isn't...going to stop me! \*Shin tried to use a different combo of bottles, but Aqua stopped him this time.\*

Aqua: Not this time! \*Aqua started to attack him extremely fast until force him to drop the bottles.\* You'll not keep using those powers...I'll make sure of that! \*Aqua trapped Shin's body in some kind of golden slime for then create what looked like two crocodile jaws with his armas and start to ""bite"" Shin with them...\*

Female News Reporter: this is...incredible...it seems that...the superheroine is starting to win! \*She said with a smile\*

\*Meanwhile...\*

John: You sure are a weird group...

Kai: We're great

John: Yeah yeah...\*They were walking on the streets until then...they started to heard the news thought a big screen on a building...\* A...superheroine?!

Kai: Is she cute?!

John: ...what kind of question is that?! \*Sigh\* Incredible...there are heroes on this world too...\*Then John saw attentively at the scene and...\* Huh...is that Sora Naruki?!

Kaiz: Huh? Ah! He's right!

John: I must go to that place...\*John started to run...\*

Kai: Uh? Oi! Wait! \*Kai and his partners started to run too.\*

\*Returning to the fight...\*

\*Shin was getting completely crushed by the crocodile jaws...\*

Shin: No...NOOOOOOOOOOO! \*Shin entered in a complete frenzy and managed to freed himself from the attacks with pure strength, however, Aqua didn't stopped and before he could do something else, she crated a blue cannon on her left arm and started to shoot cannonballs involved on blue fire at Shin, causing more damage on the scientist that was getting exhausted because of this attacks...\*

Aqua: I'll Crush You With The Fire Burning In My Heart! \*Suddenly, two red springs appeared on Aqua's leg and they started to compress until finally stretch again and gave Aqua an extra impulse to jump extremely fast at Shin!\*

Shin: I'll...not lose! \*Using the spring that is already on his right leg, he jumped directly at Aqua too.,,then both clashed kicks, with Aqua's being involved on blue fire too, and Aqua ends up overpowering Shin and making him to fall on the ground again...\* Ah...no...no...\*Shin started to felt like if ll his strength is gone, barely standing up.\*

Aqua: Phew...yeah...sorry Mr. Naruki, I'm not gonna kill you...but you're gonna still being a sacrifice for the greater good...I'll finish this and it is gonna be extremely showy! \*Two oil jets started to propulse Aqua towards Shin while golden grase appeared below her, then she started to punch and kick Shin with his blue fire attacks and also shooting him with the cannon while a little mechanical red rabbit started to tag along with her to attack Shin!\*

Shin: No...this...can't...be...

Aqua: Yes, It can be! \*She finally jumped and kicked Shin directly on the chest, making him to fall in pain once more...\* Oh yeah! I'm the Best! I'm Great! I'm a Genius! \*She said extremely happy while raising her hand...\*

\*Returning to the dark part of the multiverse from before...\*

Cloaked man: I see...impressive...truly...impressive...but it seems that...it is already...the end.\*

\*In the battlefield, Aqua was still celebrating while Shin was in pain on the floor...until...\*

Aqua: Well...time to finish this...\*Aqua was ready to attack Shin again...but when she tried to use her powers again...\* Agh...Agh...AGHHHHHHHH! \*Aqua started to feel a lot of pain while lightnings started to came out of her body and suddenly...she lost her transformation...\* W-what...?

Shin: \*Panting...\* Ahhh...ah...you...truly...almost defeated me...but...your power...isn't complete yet...\*But instead of celebrate or laugh...Shin started to get more angry and punch the ground...\* How is it possible...that I....am...only transformed on this moment...because...I got lucky?! You...you...stupid brat...\*Shin tries to get up again but he's still in too much pain to do it...\*

Cloaked Man: \*Talking inside Shin's mind\* Don't worry, Naruki, we'll send someone to help you \*Said jokingly...\*

Shin: No...I...don't...need...your...help! \*But he was unable to refuse as the person already came in to help him...and it left..Aqua completely Impressed...\*

Cloaked Man: Mmm? I see...those guys...are...stubborn...they're a clear inspiration to that girl Aqua...

Aqua: No...you...are...

???: Yo \*The person that said this tried to shot at Aqua with a kind of gun...\*

how tf is oda going to relate all of these?

also, I organized them into original races assuming some interbred 

  
ancient giants, buccaneers, giants, oni, | large humanoid creatures

humans, long arm, long leg, 3 eyed tribe, snake nec, | normal people some interbred

Fishman, merfolk | normal people with ocean connection (big enough apart they are own race)

Lunarians, Shandians, skypeains, birkans, space pirates | sky space related species from clouds or space

minks | animals + human interbred or own oringila race

cyborgs, seraphim, pacifists, clones | articial created with science

  
I'm genuinely confused how oda is going to handle ancient period and this explains why the story is so big."

For Cyberpunk 2077 players or other players who experience the same thing,PiratedGames,1i9tsvv,2025-01-25 13:44:17,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/1i9tsvv/for_cyberpunk_2077_players_or_other_players_who/,Appropriate_Rain_283,Question,"I want to ask Cyberpunk 2077 players or other players who have experienced the same thing, has anyone ever played a game that suddenly had corrupted or even disappeared files, especially when it was being updated (pirated version of course) and was finalizing but it took too long so we forced it to close?

Because it happened to me in the Cyberpunk 2077 game, yesterday I updated version 2.21 after the update I couldn't play it because I was using a mod and the main mod hadn't been updated. After updating the main mod and playing it, it turned out that the game didn't appear on the screen. Then I tried to run the file to verify the files in the game, after it was finished and without seeing what files were corrupted and missing I tried to play it again and an error appeared ""sl.interposer.dll missing"". I was clearly confused and panicked and after looking again it turned out that there were corrupted and missing files, in the end I tried to re-download but only the corrupted and missing files because luckily there was still the torrent file.

If the cause is indeed because of forcibly stopping the update that is finalizing, as far as I remember, it was the same during update 2.2 (i.e. forcibly stopping during finalization) but it was still playable. But on the other hand, it makes sense because the update was forcibly stopped, maybe it would be messed up."

I'll use the no spoiler photo flair for this.

It probably won't change anything like but ima post anyway.
It's piracy that makes developers not want to release on other platforms like PC.
(But they do because they want everyone as much as possible to play this game and trioligy) legitimately.

Pirating the game on steam and even using cheats to bypass stuff is just wrong. (Yeah it's a single player game why am I making a big deal?) Because trend and value of the game will shrink.

There's players out there that spend hundreds of hours trying to platinum this game the right way.

If you wanna see more good stuff from square then pirating won't make it any better.
I'll probably get some downvotes on this post but it's better out than in and I don't mind. Just speaking my mind.

Enjoy the game for what it is and just buy it. There's deals out there. Also supports the developers yknow

I really hope that devs see this whole steam fiasco and think twice about releasing part 3 on PC.

I'm sorry if the post upsets legit PC players 🙏 
thanks for reading and I hope you all have a good night/morning wherever you are ✨️

Kaya wants to confront Kuro and Nami tells her not to, but Kaya replies that she is braver than Nami thinks. She grabs a knife and they both try to attack Kuro. In this scene Nami is not armed nor does she bring her staff, while Kaya has a knife 🔪 which makes me assume that Nami was planning to overpower Kuro with her bare hands. I know she had no idea how fast Kuro was, but despite that she was quite willing to go to war against an armed pirate captain, even after knowing how abysmally strong this guy was, she tried to attack him again. 

I think this moment made Nami more badass to me, while my family says she was reckless and the equivalent of Pepper Potts and Black Widow trying to take on the Hulk."

Prepare to set sail on a style journey through time because it's happening — *vintage styles are making an electrifying comeback*, and your very own Uninterested Pirate is aboard this trend like it's a shiny ship full of treasure!

* What's old is new again!
The wheel of fashion is spinning fiercely, bringing back the forgotten fabrics of yester-years. From the funky flare of bell-bottoms to the charming audacity of shoulder pads, the echoes of past decades are sprouting up like daisies on today’s catwalks and cobblestones.

* *It’s the 90’s y'all* – Take out your chokers and combat boots, the 90's grunge and minimalism are tearing up the runway faster than you can say ""As if!"" And the real kicker? Those overalls you donated to the thrift shop? They’re back, complete with a fresh, modern twist. Pair them with a smart tee and voilà, you're sitcom chic!

* *80’s Glam* – Listen carefully, can you hear it? The soft whisper of Madonna luring you into layers of lace and leather... Yes, neon hues, leg warmers, and oversized blazers are calling our names, and the only reasonable response is a resounding 'TOTALLY!'

* *The Swinging 60's* – Mini skirts are mincing their way back into our hearts with mod influences that scream sophistication sass! Add a pair of go-go boots and your legs will be dancing to the Beatles without any further ado.

But why the blast from the past, ye might wonder? We’re in the age of *sustainable fashion*, my friends! It's no longer just about looking sharp, it’s about conscious consumerism. Here's where vintage vibes shine brighter than a lighthouse in a midnight storm:

− They're sustainable! Secondhand and vintage clothing reduces waste and the environmental impact of new production lines.
− They ooze character! Every vintage piece tells a story, adding a layer of mystique that no off-the-rack new garment can.
− They encourage creativity! Mixing old with new allows for an original style that flexes your fashion muscles in exciting new ways. 

Arrr, before ye walk the plank of predictable attire, consider breathing new life into vintage treasures. Experiment with patterns, mix decades, and perhaps throw in a modern accessory or two for a look that's as unique as a mermaid at a garden party.

And remember, ye stylish sea rovers, quality never goes out of style — so invest in the past to make a remarkable splash in the present. Now, hoist the anchors and full speed ahead into the fashionable waters of bygone eras! 🏴‍☠️✨

Until next time, keep your spirits adventurous and your closets eclectic!"
