**Takeaways**

* **The market faced a broad decline over the past week:** More than $162 million in crypto liquidations occurred last weekend, primarily from long positions, as US bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $276 million. As of Thursday, the price of bitcoin had dropped to nearly $56,000.
* **The SEC has expressed concerns over FTX’s proposed distribution of stablecoins to creditors:** While FTX’s plan aims to repay 98% of creditors in cash, the SEC may take the stance that remaining distributions made in crypto violate federal securities laws.
* **Cardano implemented its “Chang” upgrade, shifting control from its founding bodies to a decentralized governance structure using the ADA token:** The long-awaited enhancement allows the community to vote on proposals and elect governance representatives.
* **High-ranking Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, detained in Nigeria since February, appeared in court on Monday in pain after being denied a wheelchair:** His lawyers have filed for bail on medical grounds, citing multiple health issues, but the prosecution has opposed the request.
* **Trading volumes on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges saw a roughly 6.6% MoM increase in August, reaching $1.2 trillion:** Exchanges in North America experienced more than a 21% increase in activity compared to July.

GME: My analysis and speculations on the facts from my previous DD where I compiled and reviewed the Business Strategy and Business Priorities info from the 10-Ks from FY 2019 until FY 2023.,TheBottomOfTheMatter,1f33fs8,2024-08-28 02:36:20,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBottomOfTheMatter/comments/1f33fs8/gme_my_analysis_and_speculations_on_the_facts/,theorico,neutral,"My previous post was pure Due Diligence and I purposely avoided any speculations.

You should have a look if not done yet, here is the link: [Review and compilation of the Business Strategy and Business Priorities information provided officially by the company in all the 10-Ks from FY 2019 until FY 2023. Additional info on Debt evolution, Shares Repurchases, Dividends, Liquidity and Management Changes is also provided.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1f18i4o/comment/lk0ks6i/?context=3)

In this post I perform my analysis over the previous post and provide some speculation, all done on top of some additional info I provide in this post.

# My Analysis

**In FY 2019,** the pre-Ryan Cohen era, the company had a very conservative and innocuous Strategy, mainly focusing on optimizing the core business.

To the company's credit, they launched a share repurchase program with up to $300 million budget an bought back 38.1 million shares, totaling $198.7 million, for an average price of $5.19 per share. As of February 1, 2020 (and as of now), there still was/is $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.

In FY 2019 the company paid cash dividends of $40.5 million and on June 3, 2019, the Board of Directors elected to eliminate the Company’s quarterly dividend immediately.

The old Credit Agreement was in place, with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022.  As of February 1, 2020, total availability under the Revolver was $270.3 million, with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the company borrowed $150 million on the Revolver.

All the above done by the previous Management team, pre-RC era.

**.**

**In the 10-K for FY 2020** we start to see RC's moves and him gaining increased influence.

The Business Strategy mentions that besides the stabilization and optimization of the core business, they would be in parallel ""**... pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

That was the first time ""growth"" was mentioned.

RC's handwriting is clear in this passage: ""***Transform GameStop into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers.***""

They immediately mention some steps they would be taking in FY 2021, among them

""Investing in technology capabilities, including by in-sourcing talent and revamping systems, and evaluating next-generation assets.;""

There isn't yet any concrete references to what technologies at this point in time.

In FY 2020 they started paying up and exchanging their bonds.

The old Credit Agreement was still in place but their availability to borrow from it was decreased to only $ 88.4 million, so it became much tighter.

In FY 2020 (December 20 2020) the company launched an ATM program and later stated they were considering expanding it further in 2021 *""****primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives****."" ""****Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding our ongoing digital-first growth strategy and product category expansion efforts****""*

In my opinion the company was visionary at this point, they saw the squeeze and the social media interest and positioned themselves properly to raise capital.

By March 23 2021, the time of the issuance of the FY 2020's 10-K the Management Team had already changed considerable, with RC and Alan Attal already on board, but the Board was still a mix of old and new members and still quite big.

**.**

**Then we enter FY 2021.**

Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero join in June from Amazon as CEO and CFO, respectively.

In the Business Strategy part of the FY 2021's 10-K we find again the same sentence as in FY 2020's: *""****pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries****""*

and again

""**GameStop is focused on transforming into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers**"".

But there is more.

""**Establish ecommerce excellence**"" is mentioned for the first time. Larry Cheng's handwriting on that one, as he had also joined by this time.

*""We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment across all channels and will scale up our ecommerce operations to make the most convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, improvements in fulfillment and delivery times, better product availability across all channels, and a further improved customer service experience.""*

***""Invest in new growth opportunities.*** *As we scale and expand our core offerings we will simultaneously invest in additional growth, including blockchain, digital assets (including non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"")), Web 3.0 technology, and new destination formats for our stores. In January 2022, we entered into partnerships with Immutable X Pty Limited (“IMX”) and Digital Worlds NFTs Ltd. (""Digital Worlds"") pursuant to which IMX will become a technology partner and platform for our NFT marketplace, and Digital Worlds will grant up to $100 million in IMX tokens to creators of NFT content and technology. In addition, Digital Worlds agreed to provide up to approximately $150 million in IMX tokens to GameStop upon the achievement of certain milestones.""*

Aha, the above is the company stating they would invest in new growth opportunities, not only in their core offerings but also in new areas like blockchain, digital assets including NFTs, Web 3.0, etc.

The FY 2021's 10-K was issued on March 17 2022. so now we know for sure they were already working on those topics by that time.

The Business Priorities section of the FY 2021's 10-K is so important that I will copy it here in full:

https://preview.redd.it/pr3pbchrncld1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf4d1853a05628a60fc574781945701302764877

They also eliminated debt and raised $ 1.67 billion from ATM Offerings.

What a thrive it should have been to be working there at that time!

Really a bright future appeared to be ahead!

**.**

**Now we can go to FY 2022.**

Please have a look at the excitement that can also be seen at the letter from CEO Matt Furlong to the Shareholders for the 2022's Annual Meeting from April 21 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/6kr9v1ctncld1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=dab481b8f630886bb14ba381b5423a0c8f66ba47

Now, their Business Strategy section of the FY 2022's 10-K still stakes that they are still in parallel ""... **pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

So far so good.

They slightly rephrased the ""ecommerce excellence"" part but the content is almost the same:

\*""\****Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence.*** *We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, better product availability across all channels, improved fulfillment speed, partnerships and store concepts to attract new customers, and a further improved customer service experience.""*

Growth was still mentioned explicitly:

*""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

However, there is a new point that appears in their Strategy for the first time:

\*""\****Achieve Profitability.*** *During fiscal 2022, we optimized our corporate cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs following the completion of a majority of the necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we streamline parts of the organization where we can operate with increased efficiency.""*

Profitability. Cost Structure. We will come back to this in a minute.

First let's have a look at the section Business Priorities for FY 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/uwmf8emvncld1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=af87f1f47a01415fa330b5b47a614cf251529f2a

All we saw before until now (except Profitability) is related to that initial first pahse, up to middle of 2022.

Gamestop was then entering a new phase of its transformation from July 2022 onwards, and it is in this phase that the ""Achieve Profitability"" target belongs to.

They go on: ""We are taking the following steps, **with a significant emphasis on cost containment**:""

Significant emphasis.

What more significant as emphasis than all the layoffs from second half of 2022 that even slashed the Blockchain positions?

[https://blockworks.co/news/gamestop-layoffs-crypto-staff-axed](https://blockworks.co/news/gamestop-layoffs-crypto-staff-axed)

Some steps to achieve the 2nd phase of the transformation are mentioned, among them:

*"" Prudently increasing the size of our addressable market by growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality and other categories that represent natural extensions of our business; ""*

They mention as achievements: *""****In May 2022, we announced the launch of our non-custodial digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive, and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched our NFT marketplace to allow gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Our NFT marketplace enables parties to own their digital assets, which are represented and secured on the blockchain, and allows parties to connect to their own digital asset wallets to enable transactions. In November 2022, we launched the integration of the Immutable X blockchain protocol, which provides access to various Web 3.0 products and NFT gaming assets to our customers.****""*

However, in FY 2022, which ended January 28 2023, also saw the start of the dismantlement of all the achievements above:

[https://www.pymnts.com/nfts/2024/gamestop-to-wind-down-nft-marketplace-amid-continuing-regulatory-uncertainty/](https://www.pymnts.com/nfts/2024/gamestop-to-wind-down-nft-marketplace-amid-continuing-regulatory-uncertainty/)

*""In an update posted on its* [GameStop NFT](https://nft.gamestop.com/) *website, the company said* ***it has decided to wind down its NFT marketplace “due to the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.”***

***“Effective as of February 2, 2024, customers will no longer be able to buy, sell or create NFTs,”*** *GameStop said in the update. “Your NFTs are on the blockchain and will remain accessible and saleable through other platforms.”*

**So, clearly things were not so bright anymore by End of FY 2022.**

**.**

**We enter now FY 2023.**

One good point to start is to look at the letters to the Shareholders contained in the 2023 Proxy Statement, from the still CEO Matt Furlong (but not for long):

https://preview.redd.it/vtvq5y0zncld1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c16f86afa06c7fa910f3ef73036809692dc3b39

I find this a beautifully written Letter. It provides a review of the situation and progress since 2021 and projects what should happen in 2023.

I emphasise this part, talking about what happened in the past. in 2022:

***""In fiscal 2022, GameStop’s operating environment dramatically changed due to the onset of inflation, rising interest rates and macro headwinds.*** *Rather than stand still,* ***we pivoted to cutting costs***\*, optimizing inventory and enhancing the customer experience. We also found efficient ways to improve shipping times, integrate online and in-store shopping experiences, and establish a culture of increased incentivization among store leaders and tenured associates\*\*\*\*""\*\*\*

So the company's strategy had to change due to Inflation, rising interest rates and macro headwinds.

And also this part giving the outline of the future:

*""Looking ahead, GameStop* ***is aggressively focused on achieving profitability*** *while* ***still pursuing pragmatic long-term growth.""***

They emphasise again the need to achieve profitability, **aggressively**. Long-term growth would still be persued, but only **pragmatically**.

So let's have a look of what the 10-K for FY 2023, issued on February 3rd 2024 contains.

***2023: ""Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network.""*

However, there is a major difference, please compare the above with the 2022's section:

**2022:**  *""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

They removed the part ""**while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

And then we find the same 3 items as in 2022's Business Priority section, **Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence**, **Achieve Profitability** and **Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.**

However, there is again a major difference:

2023: \*""\****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network.""*

2022: *""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

Yes, they removed formally the part talking about how they would ""***simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

.

**All in all, it is my opinion that at this point Gamestop had gave up growth and is since then strictly persuing profitability.**

.

Matt Furlong's employment was then terminated by the company and RC took full control:

\*""\****On June 5, 2023, our Board of Directors terminated Matthew Furlong’s employment with the Company*** *as its President and Chief Executive Officer without Cause (as such term is defined in Mr. Furlong’s letter of employment dated June 9, 2021), effective immediately.* ***On June 7, 2023, in connection with Mr. Furlong’s termination, our Board of Directors appointed Ryan Cohen as Executive Chairman of the Company and Mark Robinson as the new principal executive officer of the Company with the title of General Manager. On September 27, 2023, the Board of Directors, with Mr. Cohen abstaining, unanimously appointed Mr. Cohen, as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. In connection with this appointment, Mr. Cohen relinquished his Executive Chairman title and assumed the role of principal executive officer of the Company from Mr. Robinson. Mr. Robinson remained the Company’s General Counsel and Secretary.***

*On July 21, 2023, Diana Saadeh-Jajeh resigned from her position as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, effective August 11, 2023. On July 27, 2023, in connection with Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh’s resignation,* ***the Board of Directors appointed Daniel Moore as the Company’s Principal Accounting Officer and interim Principal Financial Officer, effective August 11, 2023.""***

.

\*""\****On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new investment policy*** *(the “Investment Policy”). Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the Board of Directors unanimously authorized revisions to the Investment Policy to codify the role of certain members of the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company’s investments. In accordance with the revised Investment Policy, the Board of Directors has delegated authority to manage the Company’s portfolio of securities investments to an Investment Committee consisting of Mr. Cohen and two independent members of the Board of Directors, together with such personnel and advisors as the Investment Committee may choose.""*

.

***""At-The-Market Equity Offering Program***

*On May 17, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) providing for the sale by the Company of shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Shares”), from time to time through the Sales Agent in connection with an ""at-the-market"" equity offering program (""ATM Offering""). Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC* ***on May 17, 2024*** *(the ""May Prospectus Supplement""),* ***we sold an aggregate of 45.0 million Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $933.4 million***\*.\*

*Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC* ***on June 7, 2024***\*, (the “June Prospectus Supplement”)\* ***We sold an aggregate of 75.0 million additional Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $2.137 billion***\*.\*

*We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with our investment policy.""*

.

Now the newest information from them all:

https://preview.redd.it/immsw0e2ocld1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=17489bb6d26e1e675dd7cf854e209f57d0290cd9

With respect to retail operations RC clearly states that focus is on cost reduction and profitability. He will not chase revenue for revenue, they have to bring profit and prospects of future cashflows to be of value to shareholders.

Then RC talks about how having a strong balance sheet, specially in uncertain economic times, is a strategic advantage. In other words, no wild investments, no acquisitions in these uncertain times.

It is worth noting that this statement from RC is form June 17 2024, **after** the company had already received the proceeds from the sales of 120 million shares.

# My Speculations

Based on all the above, I can now provide my speculations:

* I believe the company will probably keep the proceeds from the ATMs invested according to the new Investment Policy, in marketable securities. I don't believe that the company would perform any Acquisition or Merger during these times of economic uncertainty.
* They may start to invest part of the proceeds in equity securities, thus expanding their definition of marketable securities, but the major part I believe they will continue to invest in the debt securities as done until now, with a short maturity date.
* So, in the next 10-Q I expect to see exactly what I describe in the 2 points above.
* I expect store closures to continue, as RC wants to have a smaller but profitable company. I also expect cost cutting measures to continue and revenue declines for the next quarters (MSM will be all over it)

In this post I perform my analysis over the previous post and provide some speculation, all done on top of some additional info I provide in this post.

# My Analysis

**In FY 2019,** the pre-Ryan Cohen era, the company had a very conservative and innocuous Strategy, mainly focusing on optimizing the core business.

To the company's credit, they launched a share repurchase program with up to $300 million budget an bought back 38.1 million shares, totaling $198.7 million, for an average price of $5.19 per share. As of February 1, 2020 (and as of now), there still was/is $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.

In FY 2019 the company paid cash dividends of $40.5 million and on June 3, 2019, the Board of Directors elected to eliminate the Company’s quarterly dividend immediately.

The old Credit Agreement was in place, with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022.  As of February 1, 2020, total availability under the Revolver was $270.3 million, with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the company borrowed $150 million on the Revolver.

All the above done by the previous Management team, pre-RC era.

**.**

**In the 10-K for FY 2020** we start to see RC's moves and him gaining increased influence.

The Business Strategy mentions that besides the stabilization and optimization of the core business, they would be in parallel ""**... pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

That was the first time ""growth"" was mentioned.

RC's handwriting is clear in this passage: ""***Transform GameStop into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers.***""

They immediately mention some steps they would be taking in FY 2021, among them

""Investing in technology capabilities, including by in-sourcing talent and revamping systems, and evaluating next-generation assets.;""

There isn't yet any concrete references to what technologies at this point in time.

In FY 2020 they started paying up and exchanging their bonds.

The old Credit Agreement was still in place but their availability to borrow from it was decreased to only $ 88.4 million, so it became much tighter.

In FY 2020 (December 20 2020) the company launched an ATM program and later stated they were considering expanding it further in 2021 *""****primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives****."" ""****Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding our ongoing digital-first growth strategy and product category expansion efforts****""*

In my opinion the company was visionary at this point, they saw the squeeze and the social media interest and positioned themselves properly to raise capital.

By March 23 2021, the time of the issuance of the FY 2020's 10-K the Management Team had already changed considerable, with RC and Alan Attal already on board, but the Board was still a mix of old and new members and still quite big.

**.**

**Then we enter FY 2021.**

Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero join in June from Amazon as CEO and CFO, respectively.

In the Business Strategy part of the FY 2021's 10-K we find again the same sentence as in FY 2020's: *""****pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries****""*

and again

""**GameStop is focused on transforming into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers**"".

But there is more.

""**Establish ecommerce excellence**"" is mentioned for the first time. Larry Cheng's handwriting on that one, as he had also joined by this time.

*""We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment across all channels and will scale up our ecommerce operations to make the most convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, improvements in fulfillment and delivery times, better product availability across all channels, and a further improved customer service experience.""*

***""Invest in new growth opportunities.*** *As we scale and expand our core offerings we will simultaneously invest in additional growth, including blockchain, digital assets (including non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"")), Web 3.0 technology, and new destination formats for our stores. In January 2022, we entered into partnerships with Immutable X Pty Limited (“IMX”) and Digital Worlds NFTs Ltd. (""Digital Worlds"") pursuant to which IMX will become a technology partner and platform for our NFT marketplace, and Digital Worlds will grant up to $100 million in IMX tokens to creators of NFT content and technology. In addition, Digital Worlds agreed to provide up to approximately $150 million in IMX tokens to GameStop upon the achievement of certain milestones.""*

Aha, the above is the company stating they would invest in new growth opportunities, not only in their core offerings but also in new areas like blockchain, digital assets including NFTs, Web 3.0, etc.

The FY 2021's 10-K was issued on March 17 2022. so now we know for sure they were already working on those topics by that time.

The Business Priorities section of the FY 2021's 10-K is so important that I will copy it here in full:

https://preview.redd.it/usdxw2f4g8ld1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72e58a87fd3ae21f50db71ef3c4b36386e553cf

They also eliminated debt and raised $ 1.67 billion from ATM Offerings.

What a thrive it should have been to be working there at that time!

Really a bright future appeared to be ahead!

**.**

**Now we can go to FY 2022.**

Please have a look at the excitement that can also be seen at the letter from CEO Matt Furlong to the Shareholders for the 2022's Annual Meeting from April 21 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/w6204oanc7ld1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=76532d6106f581d3f4efba2ebd60f2b4de9eadaf

Now, their Business Strategy section of the FY 2022's 10-K still stakes that they are still in parallel ""... **pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

So far so good.

They slightly rephrased the ""ecommerce excellence"" part but the content is almost the same:

\*""\****Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence.*** *We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, better product availability across all channels, improved fulfillment speed, partnerships and store concepts to attract new customers, and a further improved customer service experience.""*

Growth was still mentioned explicitly:

*""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

However, there is a new point that appears in their Strategy for the first time:

\*""\****Achieve Profitability.*** *During fiscal 2022, we optimized our corporate cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs following the completion of a majority of the necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we streamline parts of the organization where we can operate with increased efficiency.""*

Profitability. Cost Structure. We will come back to this in a minute.

First let's have a look at the section Business Priorities for FY 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/y2mtoe5eg8ld1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a75240791301631406fd663185aa9bb431d67aa

All we saw before until now (except Profitability) is related to that initial first pahse, up to middle of 2022.

Gamestop was then entering a new phase of its transformation from July 2022 onwards, and it is in this phase that the ""Achieve Profitability"" target belongs to.

They go on: ""We are taking the following steps, **with a significant emphasis on cost containment**:""

Significant emphasis.

What more significant as emphasis than all the layoffs from second half of 2022 that even slashed the Blockchain positions?

[https://blockworks.co/news/gamestop-layoffs-crypto-staff-axed](https://blockworks.co/news/gamestop-layoffs-crypto-staff-axed)

Some steps to achieve the 2nd phase of the transformation are mentioned, among them:

*"" Prudently increasing the size of our addressable market by growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality and other categories that represent natural extensions of our business; ""*

They mention as achievements: *""****In May 2022, we announced the launch of our non-custodial digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive, and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched our NFT marketplace to allow gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Our NFT marketplace enables parties to own their digital assets, which are represented and secured on the blockchain, and allows parties to connect to their own digital asset wallets to enable transactions. In November 2022, we launched the integration of the Immutable X blockchain protocol, which provides access to various Web 3.0 products and NFT gaming assets to our customers.****""*

However, in FY 2022, which ended January 28 2023, also saw the start of the dismantlement of all the achievements above:

[https://www.pymnts.com/nfts/2024/gamestop-to-wind-down-nft-marketplace-amid-continuing-regulatory-uncertainty/](https://www.pymnts.com/nfts/2024/gamestop-to-wind-down-nft-marketplace-amid-continuing-regulatory-uncertainty/)

*""In an update posted on its* [*GameStop NFT*](https://nft.gamestop.com/) *website, the company said* ***it has decided to wind down its NFT marketplace “due to the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.”***

***“Effective as of February 2, 2024, customers will no longer be able to buy, sell or create NFTs,”*** *GameStop said in the update. “Your NFTs are on the blockchain and will remain accessible and saleable through other platforms.”*

**So, clearly things were not so bright anymore by End of FY 2022.**

**.**

**We enter now FY 2023.**

One good point to start is to look at the letters to the Shareholders contained in the 2023 Proxy Statement, from the still CEO Matt Furlong (but not for long):

https://preview.redd.it/ephirsrn08ld1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=84cf34bf316e41a2a2edd0dee0d0a77104088fce

I find this a beautifully written Letter. It provides a review of the situation and progress since 2021 and projects what should happen in 2023.

I emphasise this part, talking about what happened in the past. in 2022:

***""In fiscal 2022, GameStop’s operating environment dramatically changed due to the onset of inflation, rising interest rates and macro headwinds.*** *Rather than stand still,* ***we pivoted to cutting costs***\*, optimizing inventory and enhancing the customer experience. We also found efficient ways to improve shipping times, integrate online and in-store shopping experiences, and establish a culture of increased incentivization among store leaders and tenured associates\*\*\*\*""\*\*\*

So the company's strategy had to change due to Inflation, rising interest rates and macro headwinds.

And also this part giving the outline of the future:

*""Looking ahead, GameStop* ***is aggressively focused on achieving profitability*** *while* ***still pursuing pragmatic long-term growth.""***

They emphasise again the need to achieve profitability, **aggressively**. Long-term growth would still be persued, but only **pragmatically**.

So let's have a look of what the 10-K for FY 2023, issued on February 3rd 2024 contains.

***2023: ""Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network.""*

However, there is a major difference, please compare the above with the 2022's section:

**2022:**  *""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

They removed the part ""**while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**""

And then we find the same 3 items as in 2022's Business Priority section, **Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence**, **Achieve Profitability** and **Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.**

However, there is again a major difference:

2023: \*""\****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network.""*

2022: *""****Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.*** *GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers.* ***We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

Yes, they removed formally the part talking about how they would ""***simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.****""*

.

**All in all, it is my opinion that at this point Gamestop had gave up growth and is since then strictly persuing profitability.**

.

Matt Furlong's employment was then terminated by the company and RC took full control:

\*""\****On June 5, 2023, our Board of Directors terminated Matthew Furlong’s employment with the Company*** *as its President and Chief Executive Officer without Cause (as such term is defined in Mr. Furlong’s letter of employment dated June 9, 2021), effective immediately.* ***On June 7, 2023, in connection with Mr. Furlong’s termination, our Board of Directors appointed Ryan Cohen as Executive Chairman of the Company and Mark Robinson as the new principal executive officer of the Company with the title of General Manager. On September 27, 2023, the Board of Directors, with Mr. Cohen abstaining, unanimously appointed Mr. Cohen, as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. In connection with this appointment, Mr. Cohen relinquished his Executive Chairman title and assumed the role of principal executive officer of the Company from Mr. Robinson. Mr. Robinson remained the Company’s General Counsel and Secretary.***

*On July 21, 2023, Diana Saadeh-Jajeh resigned from her position as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, effective August 11, 2023. On July 27, 2023, in connection with Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh’s resignation,* ***the Board of Directors appointed Daniel Moore as the Company’s Principal Accounting Officer and interim Principal Financial Officer, effective August 11, 2023.""***

.

\*""\****On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new investment policy*** *(the “Investment Policy”). Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the Board of Directors unanimously authorized revisions to the Investment Policy to codify the role of certain members of the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company’s investments. In accordance with the revised Investment Policy, the Board of Directors has delegated authority to manage the Company’s portfolio of securities investments to an Investment Committee consisting of Mr. Cohen and two independent members of the Board of Directors, together with such personnel and advisors as the Investment Committee may choose.""*

.

***""At-The-Market Equity Offering Program***

*On May 17, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) providing for the sale by the Company of shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Shares”), from time to time through the Sales Agent in connection with an ""at-the-market"" equity offering program (""ATM Offering""). Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC* ***on May 17, 2024*** *(the ""May Prospectus Supplement""),* ***we sold an aggregate of 45.0 million Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $933.4 million***\*.\*

*Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC* ***on June 7, 2024***\*, (the “June Prospectus Supplement”)\* ***We sold an aggregate of 75.0 million additional Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $2.137 billion***\*.\*

*We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with our investment policy.""*

.

Now the newest information from them all:

https://preview.redd.it/e3p3ghtv88ld1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd00cb2816f6bbf0b9a517694667305cd43dc549

With respect to retail operations RC clearly states that focus is on cost reduction and profitability. He will not chase revenue for revenue, they have to bring profit and prospects of future cashflows to be of value to shareholders.

Then RC talks about how having a strong balance sheet, specially in uncertain economic times, is a strategic advantage. In other words, no wild investments, no acquisitions in these uncertain times.

It is worth noting that this statement from RC is form June 17 2024, **after** the company had already received the proceeds from the sales of 120 million shares.

# My Speculations

Based on all the above, I can now provide my speculations:

* I believe the company will probably keep the proceeds from the ATMs invested according to the new Investment Policy, in marketable securities. I don't believe that the company would perform any Acquisition or Merger during these times of economic uncertainty.
* They may start to invest part of the proceeds in equity securities, thus expanding their definition of marketable securities, but the major part I believe they will continue to invest in the debt securities as done until now, with a short maturity date.
* So, in the next 10-Q I expect to see exactly what I describe in the 2 points above.
* I expect store closures to continue, as RC wants to have a smaller but profitable company. I also expect cost cutting measures to continue and revenue declines for the next quarters (MSM will be all over it)
* I expect that the interest rates from the investments will help the company to become and remain profitable until the point in time when the operational efficiencies will be so high that the small company remaining will be profitable on its own, and only then I speculate that the company would use their cash to pursue other types of investments and even acquisitions.
* I also speculate that the share price will slowly cool down, in the absence of any new hype caused by RK or any other big news."

This was the last FY completely without any Ryan Cohen interference, therefore totally in the hands of previous Management.

(in all quotes ahead, sometimes I highlight some information I consider important in bold)

>**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

>In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as **GameStop Reboot,** to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following four tenets. 

>***Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base.

>***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub of gaming across the GameStop platform and offerings.

>***Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.*** Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch of [GameStop.com](http://GameStop.com), to reach customers more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, anytime, anywhere. 

>***Transform vendor partnerships.*** Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams and optimize the lifetime value of every customer.

>Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and expect to incur future costs including, but not limited to, consulting fees, severance and store closure costs. See ""Consolidated Results from Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses"" for further information.

>We remain committed to a capital allocation strategy focused on optimizing long-term value creation. With this approach, we will return capital to shareholders when the time is right and balance that opportunity against the need to maintain a strong balance sheet and to invest in responsible growth that will drive innovation for the business. **During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 38.1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $198.7 million under our authorized repurchase program.**

.

>**Share Repurchases**

>**On March 4, 2019**, our **Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization allowing our management to repurchase up to $300.0 million** of our Class A Common Stock **with no expiration date**.

>On June 11, 2019, we commenced a modified Dutch auction tender offer for up to 12.0 million shares of our Class A common stock with a price range between $5.20 and $6.00 per share. The tender offer expired on July 10, 2019. Through the tender offer, we accepted for payment 12.0 million shares at a purchase price of $5.20 per share for a total of $62.9 million, including fees and commissions. The shares purchased through the tender offer were immediately retired.

>In addition to the equity tender offer described above, during the second half of fiscal 2019, we executed a series of open market repurchases for an aggregate of 26.1 million shares of our Class A common stock totaling $135.8 million, including fees and commissions. These repurchased shares were immediately retired.

>**In aggregate, during fiscal 2019, we repurchased a total of 38.1 million shares of our Class A common stock, totaling $198.7 million, for an average price of $5.19 per share**. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017. **As of February 1, 2020, we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization.**

.

>**Dividends**

>We paid cash dividends of **$40.5 million,** $157.4 million and $155.2 million in fiscal **2019**, 2018 and 2017. O**n June 3, 2019, our Board of Directors elected to eliminate the Company’s quarterly dividend, effective immediately**, in an effort to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and provide increased financial flexibility. We believe the decision to eliminate the dividend will enable us to further reduce debt and provide us flexibility as we seek to drive value creation for stockholders.

.

In FY 2019 the company still had **Long Term Debt in the form of Bonds**:

>**Sources of Liquidity**

>.

>We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""Revolver"") with a **borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022**. The Revolver has a $200 million expansion feature and $50 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans range from 0.25% to 0.50% and, for London Interbank Offered (""LIBO"") rate loans, range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of February 1, 2020, the applicable margin was 0.25% for prime rate loans and 1.25% for LIBO rate loans. **As of February 1, 2020, total availability under the Revolver was $270.3 million**, with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of $7.3 million. **During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed $150 million on our Revolver.**

This was the OLD MANAGEMENT pre-Ryan Cohen:

>**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

>In 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as **GameStop Reboot** to position GameStop on a strategic path to fully leverage our unique position and brand in gaming. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets and designed to first stabilize and optimize our core business **while at the same time, pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**

>***Stabilize and Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 693 stores in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $408.5 million or 21.2% reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. We continue to explore strategic options for our European businesses, which may include further store closings, exiting unprofitable businesses, or investing in e-commerce capabilities.

>***Transform GameStop into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers. The Company is taking the below steps in fiscal 2021:***

>•    Investing in technology capabilities, including by in-sourcing talent and revamping systems, and evaluating next-generation assets.;

>•    Building a superior customer experience;

>•    Expanding product offerings to include PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables, mobile gaming, and gaming TVs;

>•    Modernizing U.S. fulfillment operations to improve speed of delivery and service;  
•    Establishing a U.S.-based customer care operation, and;

>•    Leveraging the Company’s digital assets, including Game Informer and PowerUp Rewards, to increase market share within the growing online gaming community.

>We believe these future transformation efforts are an important aspect of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders.

**Sources of Liquidity**

.

Same Credit Agreement as in FY2019, but the availability got much lower and there were some outstanding borrows in FY 2020 that were paid in FY 2021.

>We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) with a borrowing base capacity of $420 million and a maturity date of November 2022. The Revolver also includes a $200 million expansion feature and $100 million letter of credit sublimit, and allows for an incremental $50 million first-in, last-out facility. The applicable margins for prime rate loans range from 0.25% to 0.50% and, for the London Interbank Offered (""LIBO"") rate loans, range from 1.25% to 1.50%. The Revolver is secured by substantially all of the assets of GameStop Corp. and the assets of its domestic subsidiaries, such lien being junior to the lien in certain of such assets that secure the 2023 Senior Notes. We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of January 30, 2021, the applicable margin was 0.50% for prime rate loans and 1.50% for LIBO rate loans. **As of January 30, 2021, total availability under the Revolver after giving effect to the Availability Reduction (as defined below) was $88.4 million, with outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million and outstanding standby letters of credit of $9.8 million.**

>**On March 15, 2021, we repaid our outstanding borrowings of $25.0 million under the Revolver. See Note 19 “Subsequent Events”.**

>In August 2020, we entered into the fourth amendment (“Fourth Amendment”) to the credit agreement governing our Revolver (“Credit Agreement”) giving effect to certain amendments, which are incorporated above and include, but are not limited to the following:  
•   **Reduced the amount of the excess availability trigger that determines whether the Company is subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.0:1.0 from the greater of $30 million and 10% of the borrowing base to the greater of $12.5 million and 10% of the borrowing base;**  
•   Increased the sublimit for issuances of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement from $50 million to $100 million; and  
•   Increased the amount of letters of credit permitted to be issued separately from, and not pursuant to, the Credit Agreement from $25 million to (i) up to $150 million for letters of credit issued by borrowers/guarantors under the Credit Agreement and (ii) up to $75 million for letters of credit issued for the benefit of foreign subsidiaries, subject to the understanding that the outstanding amount of letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, combined with the outstanding amount of letters of credit otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement cannot exceed $275 million in the aggregate.

>The agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including, among others, limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, incurrence of additional debt and share repurchases. In addition, the agreement governing our Revolver and the indentures governing our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes contain customary events of default, including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. The Revolver is also subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if excess availability is below certain thresholds (the **""Availability Reduction""**). We are currently in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes and the agreement governing our Revolver.

>As of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding of our 2021 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes were $73.2 million and $216.4 million, respectively. Additionally, as of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal balance outstanding under term loans entered into by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, was €40.0 million ($48.6 million as of January 30, 2021).

>On March 15, 2021, we redeemed the remaining $73.2 million principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes. See Note 19 “Subsequent events”

>Our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, also maintained a credit facility of €20.0 million ($24.3 million as of January 30, 2021) that allows it to obtain short term loans of 10 to 93 days in duration to support its working capital needs. The credit facility commitments expired in January 2021. No amounts were drawn under this facility through January 30, 2021.

>Separately from the asset-based Revolver, we maintain uncommitted letter of credit facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of January 30, 2021, we had $133.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and other bank guarantees under facilities outside of the Revolver.

>See Note 12, ""Debt,"" for additional information.

>We may also fund our growth capital needs, as circumstances warrant, from sales of equity and debt securities. The timing and amount of any equity sales would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our common equity.

>**In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program.** Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an ""at the market offering"" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock. We are under no obligation to offer and sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program. **As of January 30, 2021, and through the date of this Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program.** Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, **primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives**. The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock.

>**Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding our ongoing digital-first growth strategy and product category expansion efforts**. For additional information, see Item 1. Business - Business and Growth Strategies.

.

>**Dividends**

>**We paid cash dividends of $0.3 million**, $40.5 million and $157.4 million **in fiscal 2020**, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On June 3, 2019, our Board of Directors elected to eliminate the Company’s quarterly dividend, effective immediately, in an effort to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and provide increased financial flexibility. **Dividends paid in fiscal 2020 represents dividends previously declared on unvested restricted stock awards granted under the 2011 Plan as discussed in Note 14** ""Common Stock and Share-Based Compensation"". These dividends are paid upon vesting of the restricted stock awards. We believe the decision to eliminate the dividend will enable us to further reduce debt and provide us flexibility as we seek to drive value creation for stockholders.

**Strong statements on growth!**

In FY 2021 the company was also practically debt-free, all of the Senior Notes were redempted:

A new Credit Facility was put in place:

>**Credit Facility**

>**In November 2021 we entered into a credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"")** for a secured asset-based credit facility comprised of a $500 million revolving line of credit **which matures in November 2026 (""2026 Revolver"")**. The 2026 Revolver includes a $50 million swing loan revolving sub-facility, a $50 million Canadian revolving sub-facility, and a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. Borrowings under the 2026 Revolver accrue interest at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (ranging from 1.25% to 1.50%) or an adjusted prime rate plus an applicable margin (ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%). The 2026 Revolver replaced the 2022 Revolver.

>...

>**As of January 29, 2022, total availability under the 2026 Revolver, after giving effect to the Availability Reduction was $389.6 million, with no outstanding borrowings** and outstanding standby letters of credit of $60.4 million.

.

>**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

>**Overview**

>Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and our revolving credit facilities. **As of January 29, 2022, we had total unrestricted cash on hand of $1,271.4 million and an additional $389.6 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities.**

>**During fiscal 2021, we sold an aggregate of 8,500,000 shares of our common stock under our at-the market equity offering program (the ""ATM Transactions""). We generated $1.68 billion in aggregate gross proceeds from sales under the ATM Transactions**, and paid an aggregate of $10.1 million in commissions to the sales agent, among other legal and administrative fees. **The net proceeds generated from sales under the ATM Transactions have been, and are expected to be, used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding our transformation, growth initiatives and product category expansion efforts, capital expenditures and the satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees.**

>**Business Strategy**

>GameStop is on a strategic path to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability in the near term, **while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.**

>GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives:

>•   **Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence.** We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, better product availability across all channels, improved fulfillment speed, partnerships and store concepts to attract new customers, and a further improved customer service experience.

>•   **Achieve Profitability.** During fiscal 2022, we optimized our corporate cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs following the completion of a majority of the necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we streamline parts of the organization where we can operate with increased efficiency.

>•   **Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.** GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong houshold brand recognition and a significant store network. We intend to use these assets to attract new partnership arrangements, expand product offerings and acquire new customers. **We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.**

>We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders.

.

>**BUSINESS PRIORITIES**

>The initial phase of GameStop's transformation largely occurred over the course of 2021 and the first half of 2022. This period was primarily focused on rebuilding the Company's decaying infrastructure and strengthening GameStop's value proposition, including investing in the Company's enterprise systems, technology capabilities, store leaders and store associates, and product catalog and offerings.

>GameStop entered a new phase of its transformation during the back half of 2022. As a result, GameStop is focused on three overarching goals: establishing omnichannel retail excellence, achieving profitability, and leveraging brand equity to support growth.

>We are taking the following steps, with a significant emphasis on cost containment:

>•   Improving margins through operational discipline and increased emphasis on higher margin collectibles and pre-owned product categories;

>•   Ensuring the Company's cost structure is sustainable relative to revenue, including taking steps to optimize our workforce to operate efficiently and nimbly;

>•   Prudently increasing the size of our addressable market by growing our product catalog across PC gaming, collectibles, consumer electronics, toys, augmented reality, virtual reality and other categories that represent natural extensions of our business; and

>•   Sustaining a favorable customer experience through seamless in-store and ecommerce platforms and speedy delivery to our customers.

>In connection with our cost reduction efforts, we expect to see favorable impacts to our selling, general, and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the quarters to come as we pursue profitability. We also maintain and continue to strengthen our strong balance sheet.

>In our pursuit of profitability we seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization globally. While we expect our intense focus on expense reductions to yield decreases in SG&A expenses we continue to explore strategic options, which may include further store closings and exiting unprofitable businesses. As a result of these actions, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and other related expenses.

>By executing on these priorities, we believe we can create a compelling experience for customers **and be positioned to invest pragmatically in growth initiatives.** **In May 2022, we announced the launch of our non-custodial digital asset wallet to allow gamers and others to store, send, receive, and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. In July 2022, we launched our NFT marketplace to allow gamers, creators, collectors and others to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Our NFT marketplace enables parties to own their digital assets, which are represented and secured on the blockchain, and allows parties to connect to their own digital asset wallets to enable transactions. In November 2022, we launched the integration of the Immutable X blockchain protocol, which provides access to various Web 3.0 products and NFT gaming assets to our customers.**

>We believe the combination of these efforts to stabilize and optimize our core business are critical to achieve sustained profitability to enable long-term value creation for our stockholders.

Just the French debt is remaining:

>**Sources of Liquidity; Uses of Capital**

>Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings from the capital markets, which include our revolving credit facilities. As of January 28, 2023, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of $1,139.0 million, marketable securities of $251.6 million, **and an additional $330.7 million of effective available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities.**

>Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and consist primarily of U.S. government bonds and notes, money market funds, cash deposits with commercial banks, and highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 90 days or less. Our marketable securities are also carried at fair value and include investments in certain highly-rated short-term government bonds and notes that mature in less than one year. **Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments.**

>In August 2022, the Company opened investment portfolios consisting of U.S. government treasury notes and bills in an aggregate amount of $250.0 million. As of January 28, 2023, the investment portfolios aggregate balance was $252.6 million, of which $251.6 million are recognized in marketable securities and $1.0 million are recognized in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

>In fiscal 2021, we sold an aggregate of 34,000,000 shares of our common stock under our at-the market equity offering program (the ""ATM Transactions""). We generated $1.67 billion in aggregate net proceeds from sales under the ATM Transactions. The net proceeds generated from sales under the ATM Transactions have been, and are expected to be, used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding our transformation, growth initiatives and product category expansion efforts, capital expenditures and the satisfaction of our tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock held by our executive officers and other employees.

>Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we repaid the remaining $73.2 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2021 Senior Notes and the remaining $216.4 million aggregate principal amount of our then outstanding 2023 Senior Notes. Also, in fiscal 2021, the six separate unsecured term loans held by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, for a total of €40.0 million were extended for five years. As of January 28, 2023, €36.3 million, or $39.5 million, remains outstanding.

>In November 2021 we entered into a credit agreement for a secured asset-based credit facility comprised of a $500 million revolving line of credit which matures in November 2026 (""2026 Revolver""). **As of January 28, 2023, no loan amounts were outstanding under the 2026 Revolver** and $119.3 million of standby letters of credit were issued and undrawn under the 2026 Revolver. See Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, [\~Note 14\~](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638023000019/gme-20230128.htm#i478417a246cf49b1a9bf29604d4e0925_142), ""Debt,"" for additional information.

>**Business Strategy**

>GameStop is following a strategic plan to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability.

>GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives:

>•   **Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence.** We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes increased product availability across all channels, faster fulfillment through ship from store offerings, and a further improved customer service experience.

>•   **Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth.** GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network.

>We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders.

.

So if you compare the above with the same section from the FY 2022's 10-K, these are the parts missing from FY 2023's section:

""**while pursuing strategic initiatives to generate long-term sustainable growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.""**

**and**

**""We will simultaneously explore and pragmatically invest in strategic initiatives to support our growth.""**

.

Gamestop officially gave up mentioning growth as part of their strategy. This is very important, I am not shilling nor fudding, I am showing you information directly from the 10-Ks. This can change in the future, but for now, it is like it is.

While we expect our cost containment efforts to yield reductions in SG&A expenses in the long term, we have incurred and may continue to incur non-recurring costs related to these efforts in the short term.

The French load continued to be paid:

Mythos NFT volume is up there with the most popular networks, but its market cap and FDV are very low in comparison. If the market is mispricing $MYTH, which is very probable, then this is a huge opportunity.

Let's compare $MYTH to $IMX as they both have a similar focus, web3 gaming.  
$MYTH:   
Market Cap: $226 M  
FDV: $334 M

$IMX:  
Market Cap: $2 B  
FDV: $2.7 B

This is an almost 10x opportunity. Especially knowing that not only NFT $ volume is comparable between Mythos and Immutable X...The number of Txns on Mythos is almost 3x that of Immutable X on a 7 days basis.

I can send on the ethereum network imx from coinbase to metamask but those tokens would be lost if I try yo send from CB to MM on imx network since CB only hosts the imx token on the ethereum network .

I have imx tokens on passport on both immutable X and The immutable zkEVM but can't find for the life of me how to get those into metamask on imx zkEVM !

I have one founder NFT guardian and a pet pretty much ""stuck"" in metamask since the game does recognize them ( at least the guardian since pets are still not usable ) but I can't enlighten my NFT while it's on metamask , it says it needs to be imported onto passport in order to do that but that needs gas fee payment using the imx token ON the imx zkEVM ON metamask.....

Now I did see a ""transfer "" option on passport to send the imx to a destination adresss but I have no way of knowing if when I use that option it will end up where I need it since the destination address for MM is the same for both the eth and imx networks. I can assume that transferring from passport on zkevm to MM that it will I'm fact send it to MM using that same network but honestly at this point I'm confused and not willing to potentially lose tokens trying it out .

Taxonomy of GameFi Tokens,CryptoMarkets,1cty24v,2024-05-17 01:55:38,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1cty24v/taxonomy_of_gamefi_tokens/,WowHow06,FUNDAMENTALS,"When considering blockchain gaming as an investment, it’s important to understand the different types of tokens within the GameFi sector. These can broadly be subdivided into three categories:

**Gaming Chain Native Tokens**: Dedicated blockchains with their own native tokens support decentralized game economies. Examples include sovereign blockchains like Enjin, built specifically for gaming, and platforms like Immutable X, which operates as a Layer 2 infrastructure on Ethereum with its IMX token.

**In-Game Currency**: These tokens function as the internal currency for specific games or metaverses. Tokens like those for Axie Infinity and The Sandbox are decentralized cryptocurrencies traded independently of the games’ developers.

**Ecosystem Coins**: These tokens share qualities with both gaming chain native tokens and in-game currencies. For instance, Illuvium functions as both an in-game currency and a governance token, allowing people to vote on ecosystem-wide proposals. Similarly, ApeCoin will become the native token for the ApeChain Layer 3 rollup but remains tied to the Bored Ape Yacht Club and related NFT collections.

**The Evolving Landscape of GameFi Tokens**

Of the top 10 GameFi tokens by market cap in 2021, only SAND, AXS, and MANA still make the list today. Their consistent performance points to the enduring popularity of their respective metaverses. However, the same can't be said for many other tokens, highlighting the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the GameFi sector"

If you want to skip the preamble/context and get right to the meat, skip straight to) ^(PART TWO: THE DIGITAL STORE.)

**PART ONE: INTRODUCTION**

After his much-welcomed takeover, Chairman Ryan Cohen said to judge GameStop by their actions and not by their words. Since then, forward guidance has been cut and a few strategies have been tried.

The NFT marketplace made GameStop $150 million in IMX tokens from Immutable X for hitting the first two milestones of the agreed partnership deal which were immediately sold for USDC, sent to Coinbase, and dumped into the war chest. But still, it wasn’t the long-term revenue maker many of the shareholders hoped for.

Two warehouses totaling over 2-million square feet were raised and fell as Amazon-VP-turned-CEO Matt Furlong tried to build GameStop in the image of the last company he helped build for Jeff Bezos, but it was too much expansion and too expensive for the chairman’s tastes. GameStop kept the DoorDash deal where their 4,169 stores continue to be used as mini-warehouses for same-day deliveries without having to build an expensive shipping network, but again, shareholders didn’t get the long-term revenue maker they wanted.

Over 450 executives were poached from top tech companies and the vast majority were fired as the rapid expansion attempt bore poor fruit in the form of heavy EPS loss. Chairman Cohen became CEO Cohen and returned to the roots of his activist investing philosophy with GameStop: the letter he drafted and sent to the Board of Directors *before* the sneeze brought in a sea of cash for his pirated ship to explore and test.

*Processing img ca0xj5v6ynwc1...*

He kept it simple. Kill the problem stores, cut the unprofitable costs, and stop spending money until the company *makes* money. With most of Q2 and all of Q3 and Q4 under Cohen’s CEO role, 2023 proved to be the first year of profit.

But cutting costs doesn’t mean new paths to revenue aren’t being explored.

As of now, there are three new revenue strategies I can see being undertaken by GameStop. By watching their actions, the plans are laid out bare. I think of them as GameStop’s trident. All three are loosely related and in their infancy stage. Like the prongs of a trident, they can do the job on their own, but the success of one benefits the other two. It remains to be seen whether or not any or all will be the long-term revenue maker that shareholders want.

One of the three strategies, the central prong of the trident, is the newly revamped GameStop Pro membership. That’s the one this post is about.

Before the revamp, GameStop Pro was a paid loyalty program. An annual fee of $15 in exchange for a rewards system that gave in-store credit for the next purchase. A way to get the customer to return and make a walk-in window-shopper more sticky.

Now it’s a membership.

https://preview.redd.it/zedvpysaynwc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a41f06a3102940173f624984f8b123edc2dfed77

Rather than serve merely as incentive to get customers to come back and use the rewards they accumulated on previous visits, Pro does that plus immediate benefits. Most notably, in the form of the cheapest possible games, both digital and physical, for the vast majority of gamers.

The annual fee has raised from $15 to $25, but the value per dollar has gone from good to great. It’s most noticeable in GameStop’s core business: Games.

**PART TWO: THE DIGITAL STORE**

GameStop Pro members get 5% off every purchase in the digital store.

In addition, 5,000 points are stored when Pro is purchased or renewed and 2% of every purchase is returned as further points which can be used as in-store or online credit (importantly, while digital store purchases reward points, the points can **not** be used on digital store items). Each month, a single $5 coupon is given to Pro members (again, not usable for digital store items).

With the cost of Pro being $25 a year, a customer would have to purchase $500 in the digital store to recoup the membership fee. That’s 7 brand new games a year to break even.

Assuming a single physical item is desired by the member (from batteries to gaming accessories to clothing), the instant $10 off (5,000 welcome points + one $5 off coupon) brings it a total of $300 spent a year to recoup the membership fee. That’s 4 brand new games a year to break even.

Assuming the member wants a mouse pad, a charging cable, a controller, and a water bottle at various points throughout the year, that’s $25 saved off the already competitive prices at GameStop (5,000 welcome points + 4 of the 12 coupons) and the Pro membership has already paid for itself. At this point, digital games are simply 5% cheaper than anywhere else.

And the whole time you’re saving on digital games, you’re getting Pro points to discount your next physical product. I don’t want to get too deep on the other new strategies being done by GameStop, but a private label of high quality, low price accessories is one of them. With 5% off (a Pro benefit) and by using stored points, these already great deals become outstanding.

The only membership that offers cheaper games is Humble Bundle, with a 10% discount on PC and Switch games. However, HB costs $120 a year. Even someone who plays on one of the two systems offered by them would almost certainly not benefit from HB over GS Pro as you would need to purchase 28 $70 games a year to break even on the HB membership compared to Pro.

HB: (28 x $70) = $1,960 (spending) x 0.10 (discount) = $196 (saved) - $120 (annual fee) = $76 in savings.

GS Pro: (28 x $70) = $1,960 (spending) x 0.05 (discount) = $98 (saved) - $25 (annual fee) = $73 in savings.

That’s not including the various benefits GS Pro offers or the fact that GS sells a wider selection of games.

**PART THREE: PHYSICAL GAMES**

While digital downloads have gained market share over the years compared to physical discs, physical games still represent about 20% of games sold and the 20% who still buy this way tend to feel strongly about it. This ratio was struck in the pandemic which quickly accelerated the decrease of discs and it hasn’t really moved since then.

Even if it stayed here forever, GameStop’s unique business model relating to physical games keeps it as a great value.

With 5% off the already lower pre-owned game prices and 10% extra trade-in credit, GameStop Pro allows a member to use the company as a video game rental service. The 5% discount turns to 15% during any of the four Pro weeks a year and GameStop has recently run a few trade-in specials where you get up to 150% of the normal value. The $5 monthly coupons do apply to all physical games as well, so its another $5 off the top on the initial purchase. Buy a game for cheaper, beat it, then sell it back for more. That’s a service only GameStop Pro can offer.

If you’d rather keep a collection of physical discs as a library as many gamers do, you can always do that too while keeping the $5 discount and 2% point rewards for cheaper games than competitors.

[You can even store them in GameStop’s private label storage towers.](https://preview.redd.it/bduedmvrynwc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d67c42afc73bac43625ac8c61dbfb0630372727a)

TL;DR: GameStop Pro is uniquely positioned to create savings for the average gamer, regardless of their console and regardless of their preference for digital or physical media, without changing any of their habits. Pro’s revamp is one of the three new monetary strategies GameStop is taking under Cohen and I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait for the advertising to re-start."

Apologies for the drama ; \] Despite the ominous title, Middleman and Transfers services aren’t really closing; they're just moving to new home: [IMX.center](https://imx.center/) 🚀 Here's what's happening:

* **Seamless Transition:**  There will be **no service interruption**. Everything you rely on will continue to work as if nothing changed—because, essentially, nothing has!
* **Frontend Update:** The services are already up and running on the new and improved [IMX.center](https://imx.center/). The backend remains the same robust engine you trust, only the storefront is changing.

**I Need Your Eyes:**

* If you have some time to spare, please explore the new website and let me know what you think. Found a bug? Have a suggestion? Pop into the Discord https://discord.gg/hXVrbRm3. Your feedback is invaluable!

**New Projects Alert:**

* I'm excited to announce the addition of Iluvium and The Lost Glitches to our platform. I'm personally involved in these communities, holding assets for testing and ensuring everything runs smoothly.
* **Continuous Growth:** We will continue to onboard new projects based on your suggestions and my research on ImmutableX collections.

**P2P Marketplace Benefits:**

* Remember, using P2P marketplace not only provides a direct connection with buyers and sellers but also saves you up to 8% in asset value compared to traditional platforms.

**Exciting Times Ahead:**

Tomorrow marks the official launch of IMX.center! Expect some cool giveaways!

Cheers,

Templar

**I'm Registered; now what?**  
Private Beta 4 Testnet is set to begin on April 30th, and you're ready to go now that you’re registered and have your IMX Passport account. There are a few ways to help yourself get access to our limited space Private Beta 4. If you have played Private Beta 3 or any of our games consistently, you are the type of gamers we are looking for to test the features in this latest build ahead of Open Beta Testnet. We will also run campaigns with several partners and creators to raffle beta codes to their communities. Although access for everyone isn't guaranteed, we intend to get many participants into PB4 playing and testing. If you don't get in, don't worry. The Open Beta Testnet is live one month after the start of Private Beta 4 and will be open to the public.

**Play-2-Airdrop Campaign: $25 Million in ILV tokens**  
Over the next six months, we've set aside 200,000 ILV tokens for distribution. Private Beta 4 will be your first opportunity to start stacking Airdrop points for this campaign. All the details for our upcoming airdrop campaign are detailed in our most recent blog post here: https://illuvium.io/news/illuvium-airdrop-season"

PAAL AI in MetaMask wallet with weird sign next to it?,Metamask,1be9pcg,2024-03-13 21:57:47,2,1.0,10,https://i.redd.it/io7erln8i7oc1.jpeg,7h3W0lf0nR3dd1t,,"Hi guys. I transfered some Paal Ai from CB wallet (being restricted and unable to buy / swap out of nowhere for no reason) so I sent it to my MetaMask wallet

Look at the picture, anyone know what the sign next to Paal Ai mean? 
It shows up in my portfolio section - but not the main asset page.

Anyone know why or what this is? The total  ballance I have in my account does include the amount of $ I have in Paal. Just wondering why it doesnt pop up on main asset screen (no option to import) and its only on portfolio side with this weird sign next to it.

Thanks!"
