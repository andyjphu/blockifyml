Tig n‚Äô Seek x OK KO! Let‚Äôs be Heroes!

I can really see Rad and This Guy being very close friends.

Anways, I initially didn't have much of a backstory, until I had this idea, so I'm gonna say it like this.

Tiggy, This Guy, Prangle, Boss, K.O., and Rad play that stupid game where they snoop through each other's cellphone to see what's cool and what's lame.

Nuritza is hanging out with Enid, Red Action, and Dendy inside the department.

After it was Rad's turn, he literally deleted pictures of kittens off his phone but little did he know, he was about to get another embarrassment.

K.O.! and Prangle then proceed to show what's cool and what's lame as everybody gathers around him.

It wasn't before long they find a picture of a kitten with a bow. Although Tiggy found it adorable, everyone else laughs at Rad except for This Guy.

He feels and relates to Rad because This Guy has a journal and loves to write fun stories about his own adventures. Like Rad, he feels uncomfortable about anyone else knowing.

He then comforts Rad before giving him a hug. Telling him that he's not alone, telling him that he loves to write stories about his own adventures and also feels shy and uncomfortable about anyone else knowing.

Fanfriction:

It's only been a couple weeks after K.O.! and his gang got stuck in Weegee City, they meet Tiggy and his gang and together, they are unstoppable! They all work in the Lost and Found to make some money.

It was anything like a normal day.

Nuritza was hanging out with Enid, Red Action, and Dendy while the guys were hanging out in the department backyard together.

They play that stupid ""cool or lame"" game where they snoop through each others cellphone to determine what's cool or lame.

Tiggy, This Guy, Prangle, and Boss are amazed at KO and Rad's cellphones because they can project holograms of pictures.

After K.O. showed what's cool and what's lame on his phone, it was Rad's turn.

""Okay, your turn Rad!"" said K.O.

""Yeah, let's see what's cool and lame!"" said Tiggy.

""Unless your scared..."" said Prangle.

Rad then exagerrates for a moment.

""pfft! I'm not scared! *quickly deletes pictures of kittens* Lemme just... give you my phone here. I'm sure you won't find anything lame this time."" said Rad.

""Oh I bet!"" said Tiggy.

""Who knows?"" said K.O.!

""You can never be sure."" said This Guy.

""Forget this, just show us already!"" said Boss.

""Alright, alright."" said Prangle.

K.O.! and Prangle begin to project what's cool and lame.

Everyone seems amazed at first until they stunble upon a photo of a kitten with a bow.

""Aww, who's that?"" said Tiggy.

""Who cares, that's so lame!"" said Prangle.

""But I think it's adorable."" said Tiggy.

""That's the whole point Tiggy, what's cool and what's lame!"" said K.O.

""Yeah, this is just as lame as when This Guy showed us his paintings when it was his turn, it's not our fault that him and Rad are boring losers."" said Prangle.

Everyone just laughs at Rad except for This Guy.

This Guy glares with a little anger at Prangle before comforting Rad.

He then looks at Rad being all sad.

""I don't care, at least I'm not back in Lakewood City playing this game everyone else would just laugh at me. I feel like loose myself sometimes like this."" said Rad who was very sad. He feels very hurt inside.

This Guy then comforts Rad.

""You're not alone Rad, I too often feel lost. Dear I say, misunderstood. Feeling like a place where I don't belong."" said This Guy.

""Really?"" asked Rad.

""Yes, but the only difference between us is your love for cats while I love writing my own adventures in a journal. I would be so humiliated if anyone else read them."" said This Guy.

Rad just looks at This Guy feeling sad for him too.

This Guy then gives Rad a hug as a sign of comfort to him.

""There, there."" said This Guy comforting Rad.

""Don't you think it was wrong of us for laughing KO?"" asked Tiggy.

""Well yes, I thought that's how the game works."" said KO.

""It's not your fault KO, the same for you, Tiggy."" said This Guy.

""Well boo-hoo, everyone's lonely, it's not our fault that you guys are boring losers."" said Prangle.

""Come on now, Prangle, This Guy is a great friend of ours. Let's not get that dark."" said Tiggy.

""That's alright Tiggy, I know you all are truly my friends. Even if Prangle can be mean sometimes."" said This Guy smiling at Tiggy while he glares at Prangle for what he said.

""You know what? your right Tiggy. This Guy, I am so sorry."" said Prangle.

""That's alright."" said This Guy forgiving Prangle.

""IT'S THIS STUPID GAME THAT'S TEARING US APART!"" said Tiggy.

""Let's just go back inside then. Maybe we can see if any new missions came in."" said KO.

""Yeah! A hero and a finder working together!"" said Tiggy with excitement.

KO and Tiggy head inside to check.

Everyone else goes back inside except Rad and This Guy.

""Thanks, This Guy, I really needed that."" said Rad.

This Guy then puts his hand on Rad's shoulder.

""You know Radicles, I been hurt as bad as you. Let me tell you, this news reporter, Carla Tettrazinni, called me an egghead after asking for an autograph. It wasn't much a good day. No one even seemed to care either. But at least Gweeseek saved the day from the department getting a bad review."" said This Guy.

Rad then hugs This Guy feeling bad for him.

This Guy stares at Rad for a moment and then hugs back.

""You make a really good friend you know."" said Rad.

""We certainly do, dear I say, best friends?"" asked This Guy.

""Well I guess you are one of my best friends now, besides KO, Tiggy, and the others of course."" said Rad.

""Perhaps we should probably head back inside now."" said This Guy.

""Yeah, before everyone wonders where we're at."" said Rad.

This Guy and Rad go back inside the department where they see everyone else."

* üòú One deck is for Gitmoji, a more-or-less standardised emoji guide for commit messages.

* üîä In addition, my Tatoeba decks are also linked there. They are quite old (2019); there are languages which have many new sentences with audio since then. Sometime I will redo them all (although the process is automatic to a large degree, it‚Äôs still quite time consuming).

What‚Äôs next?

* A deck based on Thorne‚Äôs *A Comprehensive Welsh grammar* (*Gramadeg Cymraeg cynhwysfawr*). Tons of (Literary) Welsh sentences, many of which are taken from real native texts, with grammatical explanations. This is quite a massive project.
* Updating and sharing some decks I‚Äôve worked on in the past (some are finished, some are not). This includes decks for Breton, Welsh, French, Old Norse, S√°mi languages, toki pona and Middle Welsh.

What‚Äôs not?

* Any ‚ÄòAI‚Äô nonsense ü§ñ

Everything will appear in the table in the above repository, and I will occasionally post announcements about new decks here üóÉ"

Turkish traders piled into PEPE and bitcoin as lira collapsed,LoudLabs,14lgzwp,2023-06-28 14:22:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoudLabs/comments/14lgzwp/turkish_traders_piled_into_pepe_and_bitcoin_as/,Southern_Present,,"Turkey‚Äôs currency, the lira, has tanked by 25% against the US dollar since April, and by more than 80% over the past five years. Memecoin PEPE has apparently offered salvation to some.

Stablecoins like tether (USDT) ‚Äî and even bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äî have historically been obvious hedge picks, at least in terms of crypto.

But over the past two months, lira holders on Binance have triggered $682 million worth of PEPE trades, ranking the froggy joke coin fourth for lira volume on the platform across that period.

Bitcoin, which came in third place, saw only one-fifth more volume over that time. Ether (ETH) came a distant seventh with $223 million.

Dollar-pegged tokens USDT and Binance‚Äôs soon-to-be-defunct branded stablecoin BUSD were the most traded between Apr. 26 and Jun. 26, with $5.2 billion and $1 billion, respectively.

Blockworks looked at the 97 lira markets currently hosted by Binance for the purposes of this analysis, based on TradingView data.

Some volume may be attributed to market makers and other high-frequency crypto trading algorithms. Other exchanges servicing lira trades include BTCTurk and Bitfinex.

**Still, why so much PEPE for Turkish lira traders?**

A weird wrinkle in the universe meant that PEPE ‚Äî which had sunk up to 80% in the weeks following its May record high ‚Äî bounced hard as the Turkish lira crashed to new record lows this month.

Turkish lira holders clearly sought to capitalize on PEPE‚Äôs recovery in the days leading up to the lira‚Äôs most-recent crashes. Binance‚Äôs PEPE-lira volumes spiked to $41 million last Wednesday (Jun. 21) as PEPE more than doubled, up from $9 million one day earlier. That worked out to be about 37% of global PEPE volume, per CoinGecko.

The Turkish central bank hiked interest rates from 8.5% to 15% the next day (Jun. 22), sending the lira downward 7% against the US dollar. Meanwhile, Lira-PEPE volumes jumped another 50%, reaching $61.5 million ‚Äî more than double bitcoin‚Äôs lira volume.

PEPE was second only to USDT on that day for Binance‚Äôs lira traders, making up 12% of total lira volumes. Overall, Binance processed more than half a billion dollars in Turkish fiat trade on Jun. 22.

Whether lira holders actually intended to hedge against devaluation with PEPE remains unclear. Still, PEPE-lira volumes also spiked on Binance earlier in the month, on Jun. 7, when the lira slipped 7% after its newly-elected government flagged intent to relax stabilization measures.

PEPE was the fifth-most traded cryptocurrency with lira on that day, with $11.9 million, behind peer-to-peer software engineering token radicle (RAD), BTC, BUSD and USDT.

**Fan tokens also a big hit**

In total, Binance has reported handling $89 billion in lira-crypto trade volumes over the past year, with another memecoin, shiba inu (SHIB), the fourth-most traded at $3.1 billion, ahead of ETH‚Äôs $2.5 billion.

SANTOS, the fan token for the Brazilian football club of the same name, trailed just behind ether with $2.47 billion, followed by apex joke token dogecoin (DOGE).

* 36% of Binance‚Äôs lira volume over the past year featured stablecoins.
* 11% involved bitcoin or ether.
* 6.5% was memecoins (DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI or PEPE).

In fact, fan tokens seem to be popular among Turkish lira holders. ALPINE (the F1 racing team), PORTO (FC Porto) and LAZIO (SS Lazio) were all in the top 20 for lira volume on Binance over the past year.

Impressive, considering those all have market caps under $20 million. The lira trade for those fan tokens on Binance respectively contributed between 22% and 37% of global volumes (as reported by CoinGecko) over the year, during which time they‚Äôve returned between 1% and -24%.

Chiliz (CHZ), the native token for fan token platform Socios, came in ninth over the year, with almost $1.7 billion.

So, aside from stablecoins, have any of the most traded cryptocurrencies against the lira on Binance actually hedged against currency devaluation?

Narrowing the scope to just the top 20 most traded tokens shows that on average, those cryptocurrencies jumped around 12%.

But 39 out of the 95 fell more than 36% over the past year ‚Äî performing worse than the lira against the US dollar ‚Äî including algorand (ALGO), NEAR and solana (SOL).

That works out to be around a 40% success rate at hedging against lira‚Äôs devaluation via Binance."

Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 5 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $72

Enjoy :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede, Affect and Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

Hello! **SSVÔºàSSV NetworkÔºâ** and **RADÔºàRadicleÔºâ**will be listed on CoinMark spot trading area on Sept 9, 2022. The trading hours are as follows:

&#x200B;

**RAD/USDT:** 09/09 18:30 (GMT+8)

&#x200B;

**What is SSV?**

SSV promotes decentralization, security, and liveness across the Ethereum consensus layer and forms the foundation of SSV.network ‚Äì a fully decentralized and robust ETH staking network. Using the network will be open and simple for anyone who wants to run an Ethereum validator; from DIY users all the way to staking pools and big institutional staking services. This applies to using the network both as a user or a service provider; regardless of staking configuration, as long as duties are properly executed, anyone is eligible to provide service and reap rewards for doing so.

&#x200B;

**What is RAD ?**

Radicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols. It enables developers to collaborate on code without relying on trusted intermediaries. Radicle was designed to provide similar functionality to centralized code collaboration platforms ‚Äî or 'forges' ‚Äî while retaining Git‚Äôs peer-to-peer nature, building on what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.

**Risk warning:** Cryptocurrency trading is subject to high market risk. Please make your trades cautiously. You are advised that CoinMark is not responsible for your trading losses.

Thanks for your support!

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that Kraken now supports **Civic (CVC), Radicle (RAD)** and **SuperFarm (SUPER)!**

### Funding and Trading

Funding is live, and trading will begin on May 19 at approximately 14:30 UTC. Keep an eye on the [status page](https://status.kraken.com/) for updates.

You can add these tokens to your Kraken account by navigating to [**Funding**](https://www.kraken.com/u/funding), selecting the asset, and hitting **Deposit**. Deposits require **20 confirmations** (\~5 minutes).

All tokens are tradable against **USD** and **EUR** on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and the [Kraken Pro](https://trade.kraken.com/) interface with the following price precisions and minimum deposits:  


|**Asset**|**Price precision**|**Minimum deposit**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|CVC|4|40 CVC|
|RAD|3|4 RAD|
|SUPER|4|18 SUPER|

**Note:**

* **Trading is not available to residents in Japan.**¬†
* **Trading via Kraken App and Instant Buy will be available once the liquidity conditions are met** *(when a sufficient number of buyers and sellers have entered the market for their orders to be efficiently matched).*

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the assets:

**Civic (CVC) ‚Äì** Civic is a blockchain-based identity management solution that gives individuals and businesses the tools they need to manage and protect personal identity information. The CVC token is the currency of Civic, used to pay for services performed on the network.

**Radicle (RAD) ‚Äì** Radicle is an open-source protocol enabling developers to collaborate in a peer-to-peer and decentralized manner. Radicle offers a decentralized version of similar code collaboration platforms such as Github, where developers from around the world can develop code used to build different services. RAD is the governance token of Radicle, allowing token holders to set forth and vote on proposed updates to the platform.

**SuperFarm (SUPER) ‚Äì** SuperFarm is a cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built to facilitate the launching of new non-fungible tokens (NFTs) without the need for programming skills. SUPER is SuperFarm‚Äôs token that is used for voting on governance proposals, paying network fees, staking and paying for NFT drops on the platform.

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch ‚Äì not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken‚Äôs listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken‚Äôs blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future.¬†

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee of executing at a certain price for a market order. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."

RAD CRYPTO PRICE PREDICTION: IS IT A BUY AFTER TODAY‚ÄôS 78.9% RALLY?,asktraders12,tv7lgs,2022-04-03 07:55:09,2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/tv7lgs/rad_crypto_price_prediction_is_it_a_buy_after/,Asktraders178,," 

#### Key points:

* RAD crypto stock price today rallied 78.9% but later gave up some of its gains.
* The crypto represents the peer-to-peer coding platform known as Radicle.
* Investors should wait for a pullback before buying the RAD crypto.

The RAD crypto is the token for the Radicle peer-to-peer code collaboration platform. The coding platform comprises a desktop client and a web client that allow users to Radicle-Link and Radicle‚Äôs smart contracts.

Radicle works with other established crypto platforms such as Etehrscan, ethBuild, MyEtherWallet, the web3.js library, and the ether.js library. Coders can interact with Radicle smart contracts via these platforms and perform different functions.

## RAD CRYPTO PRICE PREDICTION

RAD crypto surged 78.9%, breaking above two resistance levels, 7.846 and 9.344. As a result, investors and traders holding RAD coins had a chance to cash out for a significant profit before the crypto gave up a significant portion of its gains.

RAD was trading at 7.62 at writing, representing a 40.6% gain, and had fallen back below the two resistance levels. After today‚Äôs massive rally, I expect RADUSD to rise back above the two resistance zones and maybe even head higher.

The crypto‚Äôs following resistance levels are at the just broken 7.846 and 9.344 levels, after which the 11.74 resistance level comes into play. If this level is broken, the next significant level would be at 14.197, above which the 16 and 18 levels would become relevant.

Investors wondering how long it will take for the bullish moves to play out should understand that there is no way to know how long such a move will take. It could happen in weeks or days if we get solid moves like today‚Äôs rally.

It is essential for investors to time their entries well so that they do not buy at or near the tops and suffer massive declines. It is never a good idea to buy crypto after a rally such as today‚Äôs since the chances of a pullback is relatively high. It is always best to wait for a pullback before buying.

Investors should also question whether a project can survive over the long term or whether it is an overhyped project that could collapse. For example, Radicle seems like a project with decent prospects, but I am not a software engineer or coder; hence, I cannot speak about the project‚Äôs quality, determining its longevity in the market.

\*This is not investment advice. Always do your due diligence before making investment decisions.
