Despite the high price (ca. 1500€) , this project is still very undervallued in my opinion.

NFT clothing has already been sold on the associated marketplace ( [https://www.digitalax.xyz/homepage](https://www.digitalax.xyz/homepage) ) for> 213 ether. The fashion industry is currently facing difficult tasks (child labor, climate change, mass production, low wages, etc.). With the digitalization of fashion, an influencer can put on digital clothes like an Instafilter in the future. In addition, it would protect the planet as the electricity costs of an NFT can never exceed the basic ethical needs and working conditions. In addition, you can make digital clothes much more unique than physical fashion (check it out on the marketplace mentioned above). I also read more and more articles about digital fashion shows with VR in ""Somnium Space"" for example.

In the Discord group, cooperation in the gaming sector is also being discussed and finalized. How cool would it be if you could wear your own clothes in your favorite game or vr platform that you bought on the marketplace before. Another point is the clothing market in the NFT area. I haven't seen a comparable project with stylish jackets and dresses. At the moment, many projects focus on skins in games or armor etc.

Marketcap is currently at $ 10M.

There are only 5827 coins in circulation.

Only 980 people have Monavale in their pockets.

The team and the whitepaper are clear and didn't bother me either, so I recommend this moonshot here.
