How many people have an investment policy statement for their retirement savings?,Bogleheads,1i9xh0u,2025-01-25 16:25:04,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1i9xh0u/how_many_people_have_an_investment_policy/,BogleFIRE,Investment Theory,"I guess I have never seen a real investment policy statement, so I am not 100% sure this even fits the bill, but I wanted to really write out what my thought process was. A big part of this was to be able to share it easily with my spouse so they feel included while I do most of the money management.

  
Methodology:



1. Minimum savings rate of 20% of maximum pre-tax income. This includes employer 401k match's (6% and 7%) and employer HSA contribution ($1,000). ""Maximum"" means assuming a max bonus payout (not typical) and 40 hour work weeks (Spouse works an average of \~20 hours per week). As a result, actual savings rate is > 20%. ""Income"" does not include any non-standard income such as one-off bonuses, credit card cash back, etc which are minimal amounts.



2. The above savings rate will be calculated as a total contribution amount and invested. Because we are routinely investing well beyond the 20% outlined above, the order of investment accounts is based on the difficulty of adjusting the contribution amount going into the account. Order of investments is: My 401k Match, Spouses 401k Match, Family HSA, My 401k (above match), Spouses 401k (above match), My Roth IRA, Spouses Roth IRA, Joint Brokerage.



3. Investments are made in low fee total market index funds matching the weight of total US vs. total international. 100% equities will be held until we are within 20 yrs. of retirement at which time bonds will be gradually included at 1% a year with a goal to be 80/20 by retirement. The traditional 60/40 split is considered overly conservative given my pension.



4. Using Fidelity Retirement Planner, calculate the current retirement score in a significantly below average market based on contributions calculated in step 1 and all other relevant current information. Fidelity defines ""significantly below average"" as being one where 90% of simulations saw as good or better results. Estimated expenses will be based on a 5 yr. inflation adjusted average of actual expenses (not a percent based estimate). Health care expenses are estimated based on the total cost of our current health plan (payroll deduction + company contribution). Pension is calculated starting at age 55, my social security starting at 62 and not including Spouses social security due high likelihood of Spouse retiring early resulting in less certainty around their social security payments.



5. If the score is < 100% (meaning retiring at 55 is unlikely), increase retirement contributions from step 1 by the amount needed to get to a score of 100%. If the score is ≥ 100% and ≤ 150% (meaning retiring at 55 is likely), make no adjustments to contributions calculated in step 1. If the score is > 150% (meaning retiring at 55 is very likely), reduce retirement contributions from step 1 by the amount needed to retain a score of 150%.



6. At the end of each month, determine the amount of extra money. ""Extra money"" is the amount of money left over after covering all expenses (both essential and discretionary). 50% of extra money will be contributed towards retirement following the order in step 2 and 50% of extra money will be put into our general slush funds for splurge spending.



7. Investments are rebalanced annually and the above methodology will be calculated at least annually or at any major income changes for adjustments."
London Parish Records,Genealogy,1i9xef2,2025-01-25 16:21:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1i9xef2/london_parish_records/,ManyThingsAllAtOnce,Question,"My ancestors, John Catanach and Jane Watson, were married in 1804 in St. Giles in the Fields. However, the first instance of any of their children’s’ baptisms was in 1813, in the same parish. I therefore assumed that they probably had some children during the first nine years of their marriage, but with no luck. I tried looking for any baptisms there between 1762 and 1812 (which seem to be where the gap is from what I can see) but can’t find anything for said parish indexed on Ancestry. Are they indexed elsewhere, or am I just being stupid because they are right under my nose? Thanks!"

I had been itching for a .357 for a while now, and bought this 5"" new production Colt Python from my local store. Fit and finish outside was excellent, handled it a bit, seemed fine. When I got home, I noticed that the ejector rod sticks when the cylinder is at a certain position -- not the whole way around, but only when indexed at a certain point. 

  
I spun the cylinder and tried to see if the ejector rod has any visible wiggle or movement, and I can't see any with the naked eye. 

  
I'm a little annoyed with that on a $1400 gun. Is it worth sending back to Colt? I haven't even shot it yet, so I was wondering if I should at least shoot it some first and see if it loosens up a bit. "

Question about Meta E3 follow coding round,csMajors,1i9xdh3,2025-01-25 16:20:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1i9xdh3/question_about_meta_e3_follow_coding_round/,Extreme-Effort6000,Company Question,"TLDR -
Can you get by with incomplete brute in one of the questions and pivoting to optimal approach? I left brute force in between and switched to optimal because I was stuck. 

 
So at one point I was lost and didnt know what I was doing. I couldnt explain brute completely because I was stuck and was somehow trying to find a way thru. I was sorting dictionary by frequency (I did mention TC would be NlogN) and didnt know what to do further. I was trying to find top k elements in decreasing order of freq. since dictionary will give me a key: freq mapping. I wanted to sort by freq which I did but didnt know how to proceed ahead. I wanted to loop over freq and get corresponding elements. I was stuck

Then I shifted gears and said “I have another idea in mind, instead of sorting dictionary, we could rather use a bucket sort approach.” “Do you think we could go along with that?” Something along these lines.

And then I explained him the optimal i.e, how bucket sort will solve this problem. Asked if he followed the approach. Mentioned that frequency of the number will act as the index of the bucket. drew buckets and all, coded, DRY ran the code and answered followups, gave correct TC and SC.

Am I overthinking? I coded both questions optimally. Answered follow up questions. This was a followup round. "

However, as time goes by, the two of them become more trusting of each other.

What if one day you woke up and could float above your bed just by thinking about it? Or discovered during a swim that you could breathe underwater? Or even accidentally lifted a car while running late for work? That’s the kind of strange, new normal the people of Elias Island are dealing with every day.

It all started after an earthquake in 2016 that shook the small island off the coast of Maine.

At first, it was easy to write things off as odd little flukes, but before long, nearly everyone began noticing strange things. Powers they didn’t ask for and abilities they can’t always control. The residents have been left to figure out how their lives fit into this new reality, while some are ready to test their limits, others are determined to act like everything’s fine.  
Spoiler alert: nothing is ever fine on the island.

Things have only become more odd as time passes by!

(18+) Elias Island - A Disney Personified Roleplay | JCINK Premium | Slice of life | Literate Community,RoleplayingForReddit,1i9wy1j,2025-01-25 16:01:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayingForReddit/comments/1i9wy1j/18_elias_island_a_disney_personified_roleplay/,Therascalpower,Forum,"**Happy New Year and Welcome to** [**Elias Island**](https://eliasrp.jcink.net/index.php?act=idx)**!**

What if one day you woke up and could float above your bed just by thinking about it? Or discovered during a swim that you could breathe underwater? Or even accidentally lifted a car while running late for work? That’s the kind of strange, new normal the people of Elias Island are dealing with every day.

It all started after an earthquake in 2016 that shook the small island off the coast of Maine.

At first, it was easy to write things off as odd little flukes, but before long, nearly everyone began noticing strange things. Powers they didn’t ask for and abilities they can’t always control. The residents have been left to figure out how their lives fit into this new reality, while some are ready to test their limits, others are determined to act like everything’s fine.  
Spoiler alert: nothing is ever fine on the island.

Things have only become more odd as time passes by!

\----

***Here’s why Elias Island stands out:***

* **A giant** [**canon**](https://eliasrp.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=28) **list to choose from:** Love Disney? Big Studio Ghibli fan? Or maybe Pixar has your heart.

The tester fit better but it’s slightly loose. Well both rings arrived today. The 9 is definitely loose and comes off my finger with minimal effort. I thought about maybe wearing the size 8 and then switching it to my ring finger at night but it’s too loose/ What do I do? I truly feel like I need an 8.5 size 😕

"Drag Racing to Stream This Weekend (January 24-26, 2025)",dragracing,1i9wuha,2025-01-25 15:57:23,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragracing/comments/1i9wuha/drag_racing_to_stream_this_weekend_january_2426/,Friendly-Army-8748,,"Hi everyone, bit late with this one but I had some last-minute additions to make. This is perhaps the first big weekend for drag racing this year. Drag racing action will be streaming from the United States, Australia, Bahrain, and Qatar, so there is a lot to look forward to.

Beginning with the United States, the U.S. Street Nationals at Bradenton Motorsports Park just outside Bradenton, Florida, will be the unofficial start to the major racing season in the country. This year it serves as both the second round of the inaugural Drag Illustrated Winter Series for outlaw Pro Mod and the second round of the 2024/2025 Radial Outlaws Racing Series for several radial tire classes. The categories to be contested are Pro Mod, Pro 275, X275, Limited Drag Radial, No Time Shootout, No Time Truck Shootout, Ultra Street, Outlaw 632, Limited 235, and 5.50, 6.50, and 6.50 Index classes.

Additionally, NHRA Summit Racing Series bracket racing is getting started across the country. North of where the U.S. Street Nationals are taking place, the Scorpion E.T. Series will get underway with races 1 and 2 at Gainesville Raceway near Gainesville, Florida. On the opposite side of the country, near Phoenix, Arizona, Team Firebird races 1 and 2 will take place at Firebird Motorsports Park.

Over in Australia, the postponed but long-anticipated NDRC New Year Nitro race will take place at Willowbank Raceway in Willowbank, Queensland. Top fuel dragsters and funny cars will be the main event, while the Aeroflow Sportsman Series also competes over the weekend.

In Bahrain, the third round of the Bahrain Drag Racing Championship will take place at Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. The Bahrain1 team will be expected to perform well in the Pro Mod class there.

Finally, in Qatar, Round 3 of the Arabian Drag Racing League will be conducted at the Qatar Racing Club's dragstrip in Doha, Qatar. I'm personally interested in seeing if NHRA Top Fuel driver Shawn Langdon can continue his win streak in the 4.50 Index class there.

The event listing follows below.

Also, the Qatar Racing Club will continue with Round 4 of the Arabian Drag Racing League."

Costs:
•2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs: $40-50million
•Training: $5million

If all it takes to beat OpenAI is a maximum of $55million, the industry is becoming commoditized way faster than previously expected.

US-based AI companies alone will have to generate about $600 billion a year in revenue to pay for their AI hardware, according to Sequoia. 

The capex and R&D will likely be accepted to remain competitive given the risks of not being involved in the space, however it is getting harder by the day to envision a profitable venture in the field.

Great moment for the consumer but very bad news for the companies competing in the field.

Found old builds for Pixel 4a,Pixel4a,1i9wngt,2025-01-25 15:48:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1i9wngt/found_old_builds_for_pixel_4a/,Playerek,,"Hello everyone

As you know (or not) Google recenty removed every build for Pixel 4a except the newest that has included ""battery update"" - TQ3A.230805.001.A2 and so I have good news. I managed to find some old builds and I am sharing it with everyone here ;)

From this site - [https://support.halabtech.com/index.php?a=downloads&b=folder&id=99254](https://support.halabtech.com/index.php?a=downloads&b=folder&id=99254) you can download old builds. Unfortunately, some of them are paid and you have to be registered to downlaod files from there but you can use [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.one/) to recive e-mails (even the F2A or something key). The latest free downloadable build is from June 2023 (TQ3A.230605.011). The paid builds has written ""Featured"" next to it (look at the screenshot below)

[Paid vs Free builds](https://preview.redd.it/zghouqc387fe1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4bbc15783b122830770e86ec7290416aad5dc5)

Also from this site - [https://androidmtk.com/google-stock-rom](https://androidmtk.com/google-stock-rom) you could downlaod Andorid 12 builds and older but again Google removed them. Thanks to Wayback Machine they still can be downloaded. List of archived Android 12 builds for Pixel 4a:

* 12.0.0 (SQ1A.220205.002) - [archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220801000000*/https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/sunfish-sq1a.220205.002-factory-9cce6079.zip)

You can watch this video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wa4iSxn40A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wa4iSxn40A) to install those builds. Unfortunately it isn't that simple to install them like with Android flash tool as I explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1i4ks2s/pixel_4a_battery_software_update_solvedfixed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) but well it's better than nothing right? Also here is the video on how to look bootloader - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2Exl8IDPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2Exl8IDPI) which you would have to do if you want to use Google Pay/Wallet

Of course It will wipe all your data and reset the phone to factory state so if you decide to do that make backup of the files you want to keep

I hope someone will find this helpful"

52 Steps to Joy: A Year-Long Devotional Journey to a Happier You,BGodInspired,1i9we5u,2025-01-25 15:37:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1i9we5u/52_steps_to_joy_a_yearlong_devotional_journey_to/,BGodInspired,,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/1737836859.png

Short Devotional about 52 small changes – one year to happier you

Introduction
------------

Imagine transforming your life in just one year by taking one small, meaningful step each week. These steps aren’t monumental leaps but rather gentle walks towards a more fulfilled and joyful existence. By incorporating small changes into your everyday routine, the cumulative impact over time can awaken a happier, more serene version of yourself.

Imagine the joy and satisfaction that comes from progress, the kind that happens one steady step at a time. By aligning these steps with spiritual insights, we can delve deeper into this journey, turning everyday actions into profound spiritual exercises. Trust that with each change, we are co-creating a life that resonates with peace and purpose.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!” — 2 Corinthians 5:17 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This verse is a powerful reminder that transformation is part of our spiritual journey. Being in Christ implies a continual renewal, where the old fades away, and we embrace new beginnings. This process doesn’t happen overnight; it unfolds one day at a time.

When we choose to change small habits and attitudes in our lives, we align ourselves closer with the new creation that God envisions for us. The small changes validate that through Christ, we hold the power to redefine our thoughts, actions, and ultimately our lives.

Consider how subtle shifts in perception can initiate profound change. Each small decision to live more intentionally is like planting a seed of transformation. Over time, these seeds grow, blooming into a radiant testimony of God’s continual work within us.

Let the act of embracing change be a spiritual practice, where each new habit leads you closer to the heart of Christ. There, you’ll find the strength and inspiration to become a new creation every single day.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Start your day with a moment of gratitude, listing three things you’re thankful for each morning.

– Dedicate time each week to learning something new that nourishes your soul and spirit.

– Practice forgiveness, letting go of one small grievance each week.

– Set aside daily quiet time to read and reflect on scripture, even if only for a few minutes.

– Commit to speaking words of encouragement to one person each day.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– What are three small changes I can make in my daily routine that align with God’s calling?

– How do I feel when I think about becoming a new creation in Christ?

– Reflect on a recent change in your life. How has it drawn you closer to God?

– What old habits would I like to leave behind as I embrace new life in Christ?

– In what ways can I extend grace to myself while on this journey of transformation?

Prayer
------

Lord, thank You for the promise of new beginnings and the power of transformation. Help me to recognize the small changes I can make that invite Your presence more deeply into my life. Grant me the grace and perseverance to embrace each step with faith and gratitude. May my journey towards change glorify You and bring joy to those around me. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

– “Starting now: small steps, big faith! Let each small change lead you to His greater purpose. #NewBeginnings #FaithJourney”

– “Every small step counts when you’re walking with Christ. Old habits out, new joy in! #TransformationTuesday #InChrist”

– “Being a new creation isn’t a one-time event; it’s a daily choice. Let’s walk the path of small changes together! #ContinuousRenewal #DailyFaith”

– “Transform your life, one small change at a time. See the new creation God intends for you unfold! #JourneyToJoy #FaithInAction”

Conclusion
----------

By integrating these small, thoughtful changes into our lives, we step closer to unveiling the new, joyful selves God calls us to be. This journey isn’t just about improving life; it’s about walking in tandem with divine purpose and light.

Each week offers a new opportunity to rediscover the beauty of becoming. Let this devotional guide you in taking steps, trusting in the process of transformation, and witnessing the wondrous ways God works through each small change.

We invite you to continue this inspiring journey with us at BGodInspired.com, where faith meets action and every step brings you closer to the divine joy that awaits. Keep the faith, take the steps, and watch as your life blossoms in His glory.

Q&amp;A about 52 small changes – one year to happier you
--------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Here is a Q&amp;A based on the book “52 Small Changes: One Year to a Happier You” by Brett Blumenthal. This book provides weekly strategies to help you improve your well-being and find happiness.

- - - - - -

**Q: What is the core premise of “52 Small Changes: One Year to a Happier You”?**

A: The core premise of the book is that making small, incremental changes over the course of a year can lead to significant improvements in your overall happiness and well-being. Each week, the book suggests a new change or habit to incorporate into your lifestyle.

- - - - - -

**Q: How are the changes structured throughout the year in this book?**

A: The book is structured into 52 weeks, with each week focused on a specific change. These changes are categorized into four main areas of well-being: health, diet, fitness, and mental balance. By following these weekly changes, readers can gradually and sustainably improve multiple aspects of their lives.

- - - - - -

**Q: Can you give an example of a change suggested in the book?**

A: One example might be to incorporate more mindfulness practices into your daily routine. This could involve setting aside a few minutes each day for meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply taking a moment to be present and appreciate your surroundings.

- - - - - -

**Q: Why does the author advocate for making small changes rather than big ones?**

A: The author advocates for small changes because they are more manageable and sustainable in the long run. Big changes can be overwhelming and difficult to maintain, whereas small changes can be more easily integrated into daily life, leading to lasting improvement and building momentum over time.

- - - - - -

**Q: How does the book address setbacks or challenges in implementing these changes?**

A: The book recognizes that setbacks and challenges are a natural part of the change process. It encourages readers to approach setbacks with patience and persistence, advising them to reflect on what barriers might be affecting their progress and to re-adjust their strategies as needed.

- - - - - -

**Q: What benefits do readers gain by following the book’s guidance for a full year?**

A: By following the book’s guidance for a full year, readers can experience improvements in physical health, emotional balance, energy levels, and overall happiness. The combination of diet, fitness, mental habits, and general well-being strategies can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling life.

- - - - - -

**Q: Is “52 Small Changes” suitable for readers who have already tried other self-help techniques?**

A: Yes, this book can be beneficial even for those who have tried other self-help techniques. The key is its emphasis on making gradual, cumulative changes that are tailored to fit into anyone’s busy schedule, making it approachable and adaptable to individual needs.

Then i realized/disovered tht there were controller grips that mimics the way the index holds your hand so you dont have to constantly hold onto the controller.

 I found some grips on amazon and youtube but i always get conflicting opinions on them in the comments/reviews. What controller grips for the Quest 3 do you guys recommend? "

How can I tell what type pex this is?

I am guessing B since it feels more rigid than I imagine (based on videos) that pex A would.  I guess I'll head to Lowes and grope their stock to figure out what I need.  I don't see any labeling on the line from the manufacturer.  There is a joint shown in the picture that is just a few inches away from the pinhole.  Should I cut out a chunk and add a new piece?  Thanks for your help.

Usenet for Discussions in 2025?,usenet,1i9w7ou,2025-01-25 15:29:25,1,0.6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9w7ou/usenet_for_discussions_in_2025/,sinisterpisces,Discussion,"Hello,

I used to be hugely active on Usenet in the early to late 1990s, in various discussion groups in the alt tree. 

Binary downloads were a thing, but it wasn't *the* thing, especially on a 14.4kbps modem.

A couple of questions as someone wanting to get back into it:  
1. Is there any data on how active actual discussion groups still are on Usenet?  
2. Are there providers around that focus on indexing/retaining conversation heavy groups? A lot of the service providers now seem to focus on binary data transfer and retention for binary groups, to the point they don't even really advertise the discussion groups. "

I invest in two world ETFs. Any downside to this?,ETFs,1i9w6lh,2025-01-25 15:27:58,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/1i9w6lh/i_invest_in_two_world_etfs_any_downside_to_this/,NeatIndividual1279,,"Hi!

So as I’m Muslim, there is a limitation on what I can invest in, therefore I stick to ETFs that exclude businesses I can’t invest in.

I currently every month invest in two ETFs, ISWD and IGDA. 50/50 split. The reasoning is that both are global ETFs, but one follows the MSCI world index, and the other the Dow Jones index. So most companies are in both, but IGDA invests in a lot more companies and some that are not included in ISWD.

So I guess this is just me trying to get coverage across both. My only question is. Is there any flaw in using essentially two similar ETFs? As I know mostly people say just stick to one.

My biggest issue was that ISWD is very heavily weighted to Microsoft, so I was not comfortable with that being my only ETF, although it’s the oldest running one. IGDA is more new.

https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/i/invesco-dow-jones-islamic-global-dev-market

https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/i/ishares-msci-world-islamic-ucits-etf-usd

These are the two ETFs. Unfortunately I have to contend with 0.3-0.4% expense ratios. But I hope over time these get lower.

Edit: there are further ETFs that I can use, focused on EM, Europe, US only and Japan. Is it worth considering any of those to add to the mix as well?"

* **Shintaro Kisaragi - Stephen Fu** (known as the voice of Alice Asmodeus from Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun, Naofumi Iwatani from The Rising of the Shield Hero, Itsuki Hashima from A Sister's All You Need, and Wise from Zenless Zone Zero.) 
* **Ayano Tateyama - Bryn Apprill** (Shiozaki from My Hero Academia, Kobeni from Chainsaw Man, Yotsuba Nakano from The Quintessential Quintuplets, and Haruna Sairenji from To LOVE-Ru.)
* **Ene/Takane Enamoto - Monica Rial** (played Mirajane from Fairy Tail, Hana Uzaki from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!, Houki Shinonono from Infinite Stratos and Bulma from Dragon Ball.)
* **Kano Shuuya - Clifford Chapin** (played Katsuki Bakugo from MHA, Billy Kid from Zenless Zone Zero, Yuri Dreyar from Fairy Tail, and Conny Springer from Attack on Titan.)
* **Seto - Ricco Fajardo** (known as the voice of Mirio from My Hero Academia, Sakurai from Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!, Chihiro from My Tiny Senpai.)
* **Kido - Collen Clinkenbeard** (known for playing Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece, Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail, Son Gohan from Dragon Ball, and Momo Yaoyorozu from My Hero Academia.)
* **Momo Kisaragi - Jad Saxton** (known for playing Kanna from Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Chika from Kaguya-sama: Love is Warm and Misuzu from Tomo-chan is a Girl!)
* **Hibiya Amamiya- Dani Chambers** (played Arlan from Honkai Star Rail, Mahoro Shimano from MHA, Raiha Uesugi from The Quintessential Quintuplets, and Linie from Frieren.)
* **Hiyori Asahina -** **Faye Mata** (known as the voice of Aqua from Konosuba, ~~Malty S. Melromarc/Myne~~ Bitch/Whore from The Rising of the Shield Hero.)
* **Konoha/Haruka Kokonose - Austin Tindle** (Known as the voice of Accelerator from ""A Certain Magical Index"" Series.)"

Virtual Birthday Countdown Surprises for My Girlfriend! (Long-Distance),LongDistance,1i9vm19,2025-01-25 15:02:44,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1i9vm19/virtual_birthday_countdown_surprises_for_my/,peevee_season2,,"Hey everyone!  
I wanted to share a birthday countdown I planned for my girlfriend since we’re in a long-distance relationship. I couldn’t be with her, but I wanted to make it special. Here’s what I did:

**8 DAYS LEFT**: Made a puzzle of our picture + a crossword with our moments and inside jokes.

\->used [jigsawplanet.com](http://jigsawplanet.com) for puzzle and [crosswordlabs.com](http://crosswordlabs.com) for crossword

**7 DAYS LEFT**: Wrote an article reminding her how amazing, beautiful, and important she is (and reminded her it’s 7 days to her birthday!).

\->I used this poster/template: [https://www.postermywall.com/index.php/posterbuilder/copy/b303bd98112f0c14ea0cd2100fd62ad5](https://www.postermywall.com/index.php/posterbuilder/copy/b303bd98112f0c14ea0cd2100fd62ad5)

**6 DAYS LEFT**: Built a website with our background picture + a birthday countdown.

\-> If you need source code, PM me

**5 DAYS LEFT**: Wrote her a cute love letter.

\->used: [https://gifft.me/create/love-letter](https://gifft.me/create/love-letter) (you can see other animations too on their website [gifft.me](http://gifft.me))

**4 DAYS LEFT**: Made her a personalized storybook.

\->used: [https://www.mystorybook.com/](https://www.mystorybook.com/)

**3 DAYS LEFT**: Named a star after her.

\->used: [staracle.com](http://staracle.com) (note that naming the star is not official and is not real, IAU handles naming of stars and you cannot officially name stars by yourself)

**2 DAYS LEFT**: Created a wish tree with my hopes for our future and my wishes for her.

\->used: [wishfultree.com](http://wishfultree.com) (it's originally for christmas, you can skip this if you want to)

**1 DAY LEFT**: Made a love jar filled with sweet notes for her to read.

\->used: [mylovejar.com](http://mylovejar.com) (IMPORTANT: ask the person you're sending this to check the spam folder of their gmail, we had a tough time finding it :3)

On her birthday, I’m gifting her a jewelry box and a keychain! It’s all been virtual so far since we can’t meet, but she loved the surprises (she said the star was her favorite!). Also, all of these are free, you can pay for something ""better"" if you want to, though.

If you’re in a long-distance relationship, I hope this inspires you. Would love to hear how you celebrate birthdays long-distance! 💖"
How likely is a S&P correction?,trading212,1i9vlwe,2025-01-25 15:02:34,0,0.5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/trading212/comments/1i9vlwe/how_likely_is_a_sp_correction/,Chemical-Buffalo4555,❓ Invest/ISA Help,"What are peoples opinion on the increasing P/E ratios for US tech stocks and the increasing weighting of the MAG7 in the index? 

Everything is telling me that the stocks are overvalued due to AI hype. 

I would like to know what peoples opinions are on the likelihood of a correction and what the size of the correction might be?

I want to get into the market but I feel like even though it’s time in the market vs timing the market there is a big correction coming and I don’t want to fall into that.  

Would love to hear everyone’s opinions / suggestions of what to do to mitigate these risks.

CMV: China's 5% GDP annual growth in 2024 is totally fake.,changemyview,1i9vkzn,2025-01-25 15:01:30,20,0.7,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i9vkzn/cmv_chinas_5_gdp_annual_growth_in_2024_is_totally/,nstuch120,Delta(s) from OP - Election,"Muhammad Yunus, the nobel laureate in economics, who recently took over as the head of the Bangladesh's interim government, said that Bangladesh's economic growth under the former dictator Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was fake, and he blamed the world bank, and numerous other world economic organizations, for not questioning the previous administration's fabricated numbers. This only came to light after Sheikh Hasina was toppled and the government was overthrown.

  
China's parallel to Bangladesh is actually quite significant. Both China and Bangladesh are dictatorships. Both countries suffer from severely high levels of corruption. In fact, in China, more than 80 percent of the wealth is concentrated in less than 2 percent of the population, according to ""the search for modern China"" by Jonathan D. Spence.

And, currently, all over economic indicators coming out of China point to an economy that's actually contracting.China has already slipped into deflation, which has virtually no modern correlation with a growing economy anywhere on the planet. Its youth unemployment rate has gotten so bad (about a quarter of the entire 16-to-24 population) that Beijing has decided to simply stop publishing that embarrassing data altogether. After the colossal Evergrande bankruptcy, an even larger Chinese real estate mega-corporation, Country Garden, has missed multiple bond payments and been removed from Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. 

And let's not forget that there is literally no safety net in China, if you work at least one hour every week, you are not considered unemployed. And in Chinese universities, students are not allowed to graduate unless they sign a waiver that says that they have been able to find a job after graduation. 

According to Radio Free Asia, in the last year, nearly 3 million restaurants have gone bankrupt. There is also a frenzy of foreign companies that are pulling out of China. Foreign Direct Investment has dropped to 30 years low, that's nearly unprecedented since China's Reform and Open Up previously masterminded under Deng Xiaoping. 

In the end, the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. — George Orwell, ""1984""

China's President Xi Jinping has proclaimed in the beginning of 2024 that China's economy should grow by 5%. Miraculously, by the beginning of 2025, the 5% annual GDP growth was manufactured by the State Bureau of Statistics. Even China's own previous prime minister, Li Keqiang, has said that Chinese GDP is “manmade,” “unreliable” and “for reference only,”

Overall, I believe China's GDP growth of 5% in 2024 is totally fake and it does disservice to anyone who should parrot those official numbers"

I have a Synology NAS setup with a NFS share. I have it mounted it to my Nextcloud Docker volume and presented as a ""local"" storage in the External Storage app within Nextcloud. I can see the photos in the Nextcloud Files app but Memories does not see the photos. It does see the mount, just not the contents. 

I've tried forced indexing, I verified www-data:www-data owner and chmod 777on the Synology side  with no luck. Docker host and container show the NFS is mounted correctly and display the files. Nextcloud does see photos in my root folder, just not in External Storage. Logs are vague (Failed to index file /thomas/files/mmedia-data/image0.jpeg: File is not readable) Any thoughts? I want to get memories working so badly.

Thank you!

Quest 3 or Valve Index Opinions Please!,MixedVR,1i9vjfv,2025-01-25 14:59:49,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MixedVR/comments/1i9vjfv/quest_3_or_valve_index_opinions_please/,idk_a_name_333,,"Okay, so I need opinions. I've been doing research alllllllllll day about this and frankly just want some opinions before I make a decision.  
\-  
I play mainly VRChat on my headset, OCCASIONALLY I'll hop on other games I own that are VR compatible, but my main usage will be VRChat.  
I own the Q1. And its going to shit, the battery is non-existent.. my controllers drift, and stick.. and frankly I have been wanting to upgrade for the longest time and finally have the means to do it.  
I planned to just go with the Valve Index Headset/Controllers, 2 base stations, 3 Valve 3.0 trackers, and call it a day. I found a re-seller I was going to purchase from, until the Quest 3 was brought to my attention as a cheaper alternative.  
  
As I stated, I mainly plan to just use this for VRChat... so I really love the 'finger movement' on the Index controllers. I did some research and saw the Q3 and Index controllers can be compatible, but everyone is saying different ways to make them work together.. and quite frankly I just want a hard set way to make sure they are compatible, in the instance I go down that route. I've read like 80 different things, and they're from handfuls of different threads. I do already use Steam VR, as I own a PC and use a link cable to link my current Quest 1 to my PC.  
Now, I also like the speakers and the built in microphone the Valve Index has, I was looking at the Quest 3 and I couldn't really tell anything... or find much info on it. I'm hoping its nothing like the Quest 1.. The audio is subpar and the microphone was HORRIBLE, I have to use my desktop microphone and my headset while I am in VR, and it restricts so much movement for me.  
\-  
I really could use some opinions, and if anyone here HAS either piece of equipment.. or uses the Q3 with the Index controllers.. please tell me what you think and HOW you get them compatible, and anything I will need to purchase additionally. This is my first form of full body, so I need a whole list kinda thing!   
  
I plan to have a decision made ASAP, thanks!"

Very Aggressive Roth Setup,fidelityinvestments,1i9vd5z,2025-01-25 14:51:51,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1i9vd5z/very_aggressive_roth_setup/,swadeyeight,,"I am about 15 years from retirement. I have a 401k that’s very well funded and diversified, were I to stop putting money into it now (which I’m not, I’m maxing it out plus catch up contributions for 15 more years) it’d probably be enough to retire with. I have recently started doing a backdoor Roth, and I’m kicking myself for not doing it sooner. 

I have researched a bit on three fund portfolios and started to model my Roth on that plan, minus the bonds. I have it in the Total Market Fund (FSKAX) ~65%, Large Cap Growth Index (FSGPX) ~20%, and Total International Index (FTIHX) ~15%.  

There’s a part of me that sees this as an avenue to be a bit more risky. $8000 a year, while I don’t want to lose it is not going to cause huge problems for me. Now if I were to roll the dice and do well with it, who knows? Remember, this is not my main retirement money. So with this in mind, are there particular funds that skew towards higher risk, higher reward? Or is this a case of maybe just taking a few punts on individual stocks? I’d welcome any thoughts you have and I thank you in advance for them. "
