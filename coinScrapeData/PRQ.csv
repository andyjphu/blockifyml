Surprised I see nobody talking about PRQ, it‚Äôs performed amazing over the last couple months, and has a sub 100M MC. Chart also looks amazing. It‚Äôs ATH from 2021 is still a 10x from here.
Anybody else hold this coin or have opinions on it? I‚Äôd love to hear other opinions."

Section IV.M.2.a.cxxxv: PARSIQ (PRQ)  
  
PARSIQ's Transition to Reactive Network and Its Market Implications  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into PARSIQ (PRQ) and its significant shift towards becoming the Reactive Network, focusing on recent developments that have placed it at the forefront of market trends. We explore the introduction of Reactive Smart Contracts and an EVM-compatible execution layer, which positions PARSIQ in both the AI and DeFi narratives. The paper examines the anticipated 1:1 token swap from PRQ to REACT, providing insights into how this might affect current PRQ holders and the broader adoption within the crypto community. Market activities, including notable large wallet transactions, are analyzed to understand their speculative impact on PRQ's price and market cap. Additionally, we discuss community engagement, developer tools, and the potential for increased utility and integration in multi-chain environments. This analysis concludes with a forward-looking perspective on PARSIQ's growth trajectory, considering both the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in this evolving blockchain landscape.

We recently unveiled our own explorer [https://kopli.reactscan.net/](https://kopli.reactscan.net/), giving users a window into the ongoing development and testing taking place on Reactive Network. Now we're excited to be able to move beyond internal testing, onto the next stage where we announce the beginning of our Open Testnet! 

This means any developer interested in taking part in the testing of the network can now do so. This is a vital stage in development where we get the opportunity to allow specialists in various fields to test out their ideas and put Reactive Network through its paces!  


**Getting started**

To aid any devs interested in getting involved, we‚Äôve created comprehensive documentation which you can find detailed information on our Reactive Testnet: 

https://dev.reactive.network/ 

**Unicornization 2.0**

To engage our PRQ community in the development of Reactive Network, we launched our Unicornization 2.0 campaign at the start of April, giving users a chance to brainstorm their own concepts for dApps utilizing Reactive Smart Contracts. 

This is running for another week up until April 30th. Don‚Äôt worry, no coding skills needed, if you think you have a great idea for a Reactive dApp just submit below and you could win $100 in PRQ!

https://reactive.network/unicornization

**Got any questions?**

We'll be joining CEO Rong Kai and CTO Danny tomorrow at 2PM UTC on X Spaces to discuss Reactive Network and what to expect from the opening of our testnet, if you have any questions for the team just submit them in the PARSIQ Telegram or Discord channels before then!

In the old version of the reactive network 'one pager' it stated the PRQ can be swapped 1:1 with REACT once the mainnet goes live. I can now see that this line has been removed!

Please can someone advise what is the link between the two tokens and will PRQ be able to be swapped 1:1 with REACT once live?

That‚Äôs right, PARSIQ will be launching our own fully decentralized network, based on an ambitious combination of L0 and L1 architectures to achieve cross-chain reactivity and automation

Therefore Reactive Network will be powered by a native token, $REACT, launching with mainnet. Upon launch, $PRQ holders can swap $PRQ to $REACT 1:1. $REACT will be used for gas, network validation, securing through staking, rewards, & payment for RSC post-block transaction execution.¬†

Parsiq‚Äôs 2022 Year Review,PARSIQ_net,12bc153,2023-04-04 03:37:33,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PARSIQ_net/comments/12bc153/parsiqs_2022_year_review/,FisherMan-village,Educational :PRQ_logo:,"  

**Alas, 2022!  There is no hurdle to say that everyone, ranging from retail to pro-level investors, in the cryptocurrency industry wants to sink the year 2022 into oblivion. How bad the year 2022 was for the entire crypto industry! Before 2022, no year saw such big crypto projects fall flat this way. However, even amid this disaster in 2022, some projects made their way and reached analtitude through their efforts, and Parsiq is one of those. When I sat down to write an article on the development-wise achievements of Parsiq in 2022, I had my eyes wide open with wonder. Such advancement by Parsiq even in this disastrous year proves that Parsiq always goes ahead with such a robust and success-grabbing motto that no whispering can derail them from the track. So, let‚Äôs reminisce about the developments of Parsiq in 2022.**

## Q1 of 2022

In January 2022, the Parsiq team united in Tallinn and Estonia to develop a draft roadmap, and as a result, Tom Tirman, Parsiq‚Äôs CEO, published an open letter (in February 2022) for the PRQ community members.

Indeed, Tom mentioned all the achievements of Parsiq from the project‚Äôs inception until February 2022. Besides that, he also spoke about the changing data structure of the crypto industry and Parsiq‚Äôs observations about the data in the crypto industry. From this letter, we came to know that Parsiq is soon bringing a change to its roadmap that will recognize Parsiq as a one-stop data solution for the public. The main goal of Parsiq is: ""blockchain data should be easily accessible to all.‚Äô‚Äô

Later on, Parsiq published their updated roadmap on March 31, 2022, and through this newly published roadmap, Parsiq introduced their new products‚Äîthe Tsunami API, Data Hubs, Data Lakes, SDKs, Atlas, and Hybrid‚Äîand their use cases to the public. It‚Äôs clear from Parsiq‚Äôs new roadmap that Parsiq is going to analyze every single piece of data in the Web3 industry thoroughly.

## Q2 of 2022

We can also recognize the Q2 of 2022 as the listing quarter of Parsiq because, in this single quarter, the Parsiq token got listed in all top-leading crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Crypto (dot) com, Huobi Global, etc.

On the other hand, the Alpha testing of Parsiq‚Äôs Tsunami API has been started on the ETH, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon blockchains. This factor has grabbed our attention because, even though Parsiq was once confined to only the ETH and BSC blockchains, now the project runs its work on all leading blockchains simultaneously. This is really the outer expression of Parsiq‚Äôs mature business model.

## Q3 of 2022

In this quarter, most of the Parsiq products went live because the Tsunami API went live for the first time in this quarter. In the beginning, historical data streaming took place on Tsunami API and then real-time data streaming features went live. Finding any piece of historical and real-time data on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche has become possible through Tsunami API, the first product of PRQ. It‚Äôs a big relief for everyone from retail crypto user to big crypto projects in the crypto industry because finding any data in the crypto industry is an arduous and time-consuming task. 

On the other hand, the NFT data lake, which is an easy and customized way for getting Web3 data, also went live in this quarter.

## Q4 2022

Q4 was a dark chapter for the crypto industry due to the FTX collapse. Almost all crypto projects bore the brunt of the collapse. But Parsiq recovered from this situation by running a ‚Äò‚ÄôBuild Back Recovery Pack‚Äô‚Äô campaign for the FTX collapse-affected crypto projects. Arranging this campaign by Parsiq proves that they have a heart too, besides a business mindset.

To keep Parsiq‚Äôs community members cheerful, Parsiq launched some interesting events, including the ""Parsiq Series of Poker‚Äô‚Äô and ""12 Days of Parsiq‚Äô‚Äô by the end of 2022. Parsiq community members really enjoyed these events to the fullest.

**Indeed, what Parsiq did in 2022 wasn‚Äôt so easy. Launching complicated data-extracting products like Tsunami API and NFT Data Lake and live-streaming them so quickly proves how dedicated and honest their newly-developed roadmap is. Prompt live-streaming of these new products has kept Parsiq ahead of its contemporary competitors.**

**However, how are you evaluating the Parsiq development phase in 2022? Which development of Parsiq has grabbed your attention the most?**"

Of course, we‚Äôre also always on the lookout for opportunities to expand our client base. Which is why we‚Äôre turning some of our attention to AI projects and their data needs. 

You may remember that PARSIQ CEO Tom Tirman jumped into our [telegram chat](http://parsiqtrading/) not too long ago to discuss the convergence of AI and blockchain. We can now update you that we have started speaking with some AI startups, who are looking to use AI algorithms on top of PARSIQ‚Äôs on-chain data. Interesting times indeed! üòé

With this in mind, we‚Äôve written a blog called, ‚ÄòThe Future of Data‚Ää-‚ÄäAI and Beyond:

Artificial Intelligence Breakthroughs Highlight the True Value and Power of Data‚Äô to help explore the relationship between AI and Big Data. 

We hope you‚Äôll find it useful to learn a little bit more about how ChatGPT uses data, and to find out how PARSIQ will be among those prepared to provide the data tools required to help train the future of AI.

You could argue that actual applications like DeFi, Gaming, NFTs etc. are more important, but none of them can function without data pipelines.

At [@parsiq\_net](https://twitter.com/parsiq_net) we are making data instantly and universally accessible.  Blockchain data is not like most datasets. You cannot instantly get what you need. It is not structured.   Data availability will foster the user experience needed to bring billions of users to Web3.

Although extremely important, it is not enough to have the data ready and available.  You need to have it transformed in a readable valuable format, ready to use through a blazingly-fast endpoint.  PARSIQ's Data Lakes offer just that. The transformation of blockchain data.

Our team has been working extensively throughout Q4 in partnership with the L1/L2 teams to bring the network integrations to market that will go live within January and February along with Data Lakes for some of the flagship apps and protocols on those chains.

Data startups within the space have commanded some of the most impressive valuations in the last years. I expect this to continue.  Data has long since flipped most goods and services as the most valuable commodity. Commerce, Internet, AI etc. Web3 will be no different.''

This year was destined to get off to a strong start for $PRQ, with January 2023 marking an end to the 1.54 million in $PRQ circulating supply inflation we've seen each month for the last 2 years ‚Äì the unlocks from the PRQ Advisors Wallet come to an end!

**Are there any plans to expand circulating supply?**

$PRQ has a finite supply and no more than 310,256,872 will ever exist. The majority of the remaining tokens out of circulation are held in the $PRQ reserve wallet at 125 million tokens, which is locked until further notice and has never been touched since the launch of the token. 

Additionally, there are currently 50+ million tokens staked in IQ Protocol. 

**So, what does this mean?**

Well, this means that the majority of $PRQ which will ever be in existence is already circulating amongst holders and traders! 

Anyone who has held a highly inflationary token will attest that this leaves $PRQ in one of the strongest possible positions for 2023!

Hypersea is the brain-child of prolific blockchain engineer Anatoly Ressin ‚Ääthe co-founder of PARSIQ and IQ Protocol. And just so you know, he has $PRQ holders top of mind‚Ä¶ more on that below.

PARSIQ provided the blockchain data crucial to the development of the precise mathematical models used to establish the basis for the Hypersea DEX. More details on the role PARSIQ played will be released over time. 

Finally, our frens at Hypersea consider PRQties family & have been gracious enough to extend some tasty treats to the Qties by way of airdrop of their $HYPS token!

An amazing gift!

How can you qualify? It‚Äôs all based on rewarding those who have staked, are staking, or will stake $PRQ in IQ Protocol before TGE of $HYPS.

**Tom:** I have a work call around/after midnight my time, so I thought I would jump and do

a quick QA discussion.

There have been few AMAs in the last months, so I thought I would pop in, answer

questions, and expand on some of the info given last Thursday on Youtube. If all of you

are still awake, happy to discuss all sorts of topics - PARSIQ, crypto, the economy etc.

&#x200B;

Q: Any alpha on who the calls with?

**Tom:** It's a VC from the US. Been getting a lot of these meetings lately. Similar to

2018/2019, investor interest is back to infrastructure/data plays in Web3 right now.

&#x200B;

Q: Early days, but do you know if Parsiq has already onboarded customers that

migrated from another provider?

**Tom:** Yeah, quite a few have switched over from Alchemy, Moralis, Covalent etc. Those

are all different use cases. It's just those particular providers weren't best suited to solve

those specific pain points.

&#x200B;

Q: I had asked this before, but any consideration on adjusting the price model to be

more competitive. Increased operations per month or reduced cost ?

**Tom:** Yes, the price model is being revamped as we speak.

&#x200B;

Q: (and what shortcomings does Parsiq solve?)

**Tom:** When you think about key differentiators of PARSIQ vs most other data providers

that I know:

‚óè speed and reliability

‚óè push-based streams in addition to pull-based queries

‚óè customizability, type of datasets, custom approach

‚óè delivery types etc.

Most key advantage is Data Lakes/Data Hubs. Almost no one does that. Subgraphs

have overlap, but the speed, complexity, effort, cost and friction related to running those

is not for everyone.

&#x200B;

Q: Do you ever see data being monopolized / dominated , or do you think they‚Äôll always

be a market share across multiple providers?

**Tom:** Good question. Right now I would say the market will be shared.

Then again, people thought the same about search engines before Google came along.

But I see a clear gap/opening in the market right now. There is really no one full-suite

solution where you can get all your blockchain data needs instantly, without the cost,

friction, time and complexity. Honestly, I haven't seen many devs happy with existing

data providers. PARSIQ is now trying to fill that gap.

&#x200B;

Q: When comparing Moralis for example to Parsiq what are key differences.

How does Parsiq separate itself? How does it gain an edge? Someone mentioned data

lakes, what benefits does it serve, and difference between this and a bunch of archival

nodes ?

**Tom:** The thing with Data Lakes is that in addition to indexing the whole history of these

chains, we take specific use cases (like NFTs) or specific protocols/dapps, dive into their

business logic, decode their smart contracts and all events related to them into

meaningful processed structured data and allow easy access. In addition, we can

implement off-chain logic and off-chain data to be combined with the on-chain data sets

to give them the one stop shop backend solution. Add in push-based streams via

Websockets and you got everything you need if you are building in Web3.

All you need is to have the contracts and the front-end. Everything else you can do on

PARSIQ easily.

&#x200B;

Q: Are the parsiq tokenomics being reworked?

**Tom:** Yes, tokenomics are being reworked. New model will include PARSIQ DAO, voting

rights, grant initiatives to get third-party developers to build and deploy their Data Lakes

on the PARSIQ Network, stake-to-access for builders and monetization models. More

info coming.

&#x200B;

Q: Are websockets live? And is the SDK making progress?

**Tom:** The SDK for other projects will be ready soon. The public SDK is in heavy

development. Websockets not live yet, just Webhooks for now, but they are coming.

&#x200B;

Q: ""wen bull market""

**Tom:** Not too soon, I'm afraid. But I do think we are halfway or more past the bear

market. Then again, who knows, might be wrong.

&#x200B;

Q: From a personal/speculative valuation perspective, what value would you put Parsiq

at?

**Tom:** Valuations for tech startups in general are a tricky thing. Especially in Web3.

There is no formula. All we can do is look at other startups in the infrastructure space.

Alchemy raised at 10.2b valuation. Block Daemon at over 3b.

Moralis, Tenderly, nxyz all raised at 200-300m valuations.

But these are equity valuations. Tokens work differently. Doesn't Decentraland have like

30 daily active users and has a fully diluted market cap of billions?

&#x200B;

Q: The monthly unlocks finish (I think) early next year. After that, is PRQ¬¥s circulating

supply staying constant, or is there another inflation source?

**Tom:** The unlocks should finish January 1st, this is in a couple of months and that

should be about it.

&#x200B;

Q: Did you already sell a portion of your $PRQ ? or you are a true hodler ?

**Tom:** Nah, didn't sell any. Luckily, I didn't have to since the bullrun was kind to everyone

at some point, so my main portfolio had decent growth. I felt that we haven't taken

PARSIQ to the level of growth that would make me think ""now I deserve to take some

off the table."" So much to do yet.

&#x200B;

Q: Hey @ tomtirman ! How have you found the demand split between products? Is it

more data lake driven than live triggers? Can you give any insight on exciting use cases

being developed?

**Tom:** Plenty of need for fundamental data, but the key takeaway is that Data Lakes are

the key differentiator - the problem solver for all these projects and that is what we are

doubling down on.

&#x200B;

Q: Do you already know at what valuation IQT will be launched?

**Tom:** Cannot say exactly, we will know that prior to launch. It depends on a lot of factors.

&#x200B;

Q: At what price of BTC would you go ""all in"" in crypto? Or for you it's not about the

price but the economical environment?

**Tom:** It is definitely about the environment. But the part of my stables that I know I

wouldn't need for years, I would go all in at around 10k, give or take.

&#x200B;

Q: Solana seems to be the number one contender for Ethereum. Can we expect

Tsunami launching there soon?

**Tom:** We decided to focus on EVM-like chains first. But we will do the others as well

including Solana. Just had a call with another non-EVM Solana killer to support their

chain and be part of their ecosystem. So we will be pursuing that, but likely after eoy.

&#x200B;

Q: Really cool to read. And so at which level of growth you‚Äôll double think about taking

some profit ? (How many dollars for one prq ?)

**Tom:** It is not really about the dollar value. It is more like, have I and the team taken

PARSIQ to that point in the growth curve and market adoption that now it is fitting to

take a bit off? We've done a lot considering we started with nothing, but I still feel the

biggest work is ahead of us.

&#x200B;

Q: How is Anatoly doing? Any magic trick out of his pocket soon?

**Tom:** Yeah, he's good, busy doing complex industry-changing mathematical equations

&#x200B;

Q: Hi Tom! Exciting to have you here. I usually cannot be present for live amas.

I am wondering about the widespread use of tsunami. It seemed like the chains it

launched on were supporters. Like avax, bsc, and polygon tweeting and spreading the

news. How have these chains responded since the launch? Any good feedback? Do

they use it at all? What specific or concrete details might you be able to share?

**Tom:** The relationship with these chains is deeper than ever. Stay tuned for some

exciting news on what we are doing further with the teams of these L1 chains.

&#x200B;

Q: Curious about where Parsiq leads are generated. Of onboarded customers, what's

the rough split between those that were approached by Parsiq, and those that got in

touch with Parsiq themselves?

**Tom:** Usually either outbound leads or referrals from other partners/L1 chains/investors

etc. We are working on some marketing funnels to increase the ratio of inbound leads.

&#x200B;

Q: Thank you!

Now for a more funny question. Would you rather eat a hearty and home style parsnip

stew (like goulash) or honey roasted parsnips and steak

**Tom:** Honey roasted parsnips and steak.

&#x200B;

Q: Interesting that L1s are referring customers. You must have some great relationships

with these companies?

**Tom:** Yes, things are really moving forward a lot of them. Massive opportunities.

&#x200B;

Q: Still planning to integrate Kadena? A competitor got a grant from their Eco fund to be

their data provider

**Tom:** Kadena is not EVM, so it would be later in the pipeline.

&#x200B;

Q: What‚Äôs your favourite PARSIQ memory?

**Tom:** Can't pick a favorite. It's been 4 years and all of them are different. I cherish the

whole experience and the team I get to work with.

Outro: Running off to my call. Thanks for popping in, everyone. See you soon"

The Utility Power of PRQ Token,PARSIQ_net,xqz0yo,2022-09-29 01:12:09,14,0.95,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PARSIQ_net/comments/xqz0yo/the_utility_power_of_prq_token/,FisherMan-village,Educational :PRQ_logo:,"  

Some new Parsiq community members have been seen for the last few days, asking a question on Parsiq‚Äôs social media about PRQ token utility. Their repeatedly asking this question inspired us to open this Reddit thread. Whenever thinking of any useful content on the Cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs token utility, first and foremost, one of the most viral articles on Parsiq Medium captioned ‚Äò‚ÄôToken Not Needed‚Äô‚Äô pops up in our eyes. This outstanding article will smartly outline how a token can fail even after the crypto project becomes successful. 

**Now come to the topic of the PRQ token‚Äôs utility. Indeed, the PRQ token is the fuel of Parsiq‚Äôs all data monitoring services, i.e., you have to pay with PRQ tokens for every service you use on the Parsiq ecosystem. Otherwise, you must hold a certain amount of PRQ for using any Parsiq service. It‚Äôs really interesting that when any client wants to pay with stable coins or fiat, Parsiq converts the stablecoin or fiat into PRQ tokens and then accepts the payment. It strongly means that every single transaction on the Parsiq ecosystem turns PRQ tokens even more precious.** 

Now, let‚Äôs head into the discussion of the PRQ token utility. 

# PRQ token Utility: 5 in 1 (even more)

**- You can enjoy massive discounts if you pay with PRQ tokens for Parsiq services (it‚Äôs a huge inspiration for Parsiq clients to pay with PRQ tokens).**

**- Holding a certain amount of PRQ tokens enables a holder to enjoy maximum services for free (so, Parsiq clients will become PRQ token holders under this model for their own sake).**

**- Those who buy PRQ tokens can earn passive income by staking PRQ token (it will create an artificial crisis in the circulating supply. For example, presently, more than 32% of PRQ tokens are in IQ protocol renting of circulating supply).**

**- If Parsiq service-adopting clients think the price of PRQ is too high, then they can rent PRQ tokens from the IQ protocol to enjoy Parsiq services for a little expense. (The opportunity of enjoying Parsiq‚Äôs services for a little expense will accelerate its mass adoption).**

**- The PARSIQ DAO- we all know that Parsiq will soon launch Parsiq Dao on its ecosystem. With its launching, PRQ token holders will attain the power of voting. Their voting power will be proportionate to the amount of PRQs they hold. So, this DAO model will incorporate the PRQ token into the utility class of the Royal group.** 

It‚Äôs clear from Parsiq‚Äôs newly updated roadmap published in March 2022 that Parsiq will lead the data monitoring part of the Web 3.0 industry through Tsunami API, Data Lakes, Data Hub, and SDK service. And behind every service out of those mentioned, the PRQ token will work as fuel. Another interesting thing we want to remind you of is that the total supply of the PRQ token is 310M only, whereas a mere crypto exchange in the crypto industry needs to analyze millions of data every day. So, it goes without saying that there is a visible shortage of PRQ tokens compared to skyrocketing utility of Parsiq services.

**You will hardly find such a project in the entire crypto industry where both parties- token holders and service-adopting customers- are equally happy and satisfied because both parties nurture different intentions and demands. On one side, token holders want the price to stay volatile initially and then moons.**

**On the other side, service-adopting customers want stability in price so they can adopt long-term services in the same calculation. So, crypto projects have no end of troubles to satisfy both parties. For that reason, we rarely find successful business-oriented tokenomics nowadays in the crypto industry. But the thing is exceptional for Parsiq because the project uses IQ protocol as a weapon to keep both parties pleased.  So, Parsiq‚Äôs mass adoption is nothing but a matter of time.** 

To be honest, Parsiq is still in its developing phase. As soon as Parsiq launches all of its products in full swing, the magic will start- the magic of the PRQ token‚Äôs utility power. Are you excited to see the magic of the PRQ token‚Äôs unlimited utility power?"
