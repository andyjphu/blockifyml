Stablecoins offer a crypto-based medium of exchange which aim to maintain a stable value and perform a range of important functions, including cross-border remittances and DeFi collateralization.
2. While stablecoins can be backed by either fiat, commodities or crypto, the most widely adopted variants aim to be pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar and are collateralized with over $100b of real world assets.
3. Each stablecoin variant comes with its own risks, which have to be carefully considered. These risks include, but are not limited to, counterparty risk, regulation and systemic failure.

# What are stablecoins? 🔍

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are created with the aim of maintaining a stable value, as opposed to assets like [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bitcoin) whose prices are [highly volatile](https://www.kraken.com/learn/crypto-market-volatility). 

Broadly speaking, there are two main types of stablecoins:

1. Collateralized stablecoins, backed by real world assets and crypto. 
2. Algorithmic stablecoins, managed by algorithms and smart contracts.

Through a variety of methods, stablecoins harness the benefits of blockchain technology while allowing users to park capital in assets that attempt to hold their value.

However, achieving price stability has proved challenging for many, and not all stablecoin projects have succeeded in this endeavor, as we’ll explore below.  


# Why are stablecoins important? 🚨

Stablecoins have been heralded as [‘Crypto’s Killer App’](https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoins-are-cryptos-killer-app-so-far-just-not-terra) and offer a range of functionality in and out of the crypto sphere. Here are some of the main use cases:

* **A bridge:** Stablecoins offer a bridge between the world of traditional finance and DeFi, reducing the operational friction for businesses and individuals to interact with the cryptocurrency space. 
* **Trading:** Stablecoins are considered by some to be the lifeblood of cryptocurrency markets, enabling investors to trade in and out of more volatile assets. Most cryptocurrencies are arguably too volatile to act as a reliable medium of exchange, but stablecoins attempt to resolve this issue. Further, in derivatives markets, futures contracts margined by a [USD-pegged stablecoin](https://cryptoslate.com/insights/decline-in-crypto-margined-futures-signals-shift-towards-stable-collateral/) now account for a sizable proportion of the overall open interest, while Bitcoin-margined futures are in decline. Stablecoins allow traders to trade a range of instruments with superior volume at exchanges where there is no option to trade in fiat currencies.
* **DeFi:** Many of the largest DeFi platforms use stablecoins for collateral, lending assets or providing liquidity, and investors are attracted to using a stablecoin for these purposes. This is evidenced by the huge growth in DeFI [total value locked (TVL)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1272181/defi-tvl-in-multiple-blockchains/) since 2018, which is forecasted to grow from $59b billion in 2023 to [$337 billion by 2030](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/decentralized-finance-technology-market-107823).
* **The Unbanked:** If you reside in a nation where your local fiat currency is being debased or you don’t have access to reliable financial services, stablecoins offer a lifeline. Through the use of peer-to-peer exchanges, crypto ATMs and decentralized exchanges, anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can interact with this digital economy. Borderless, programmable with faster transaction times and lower fees, stablecoins are also used for remittances, offering a cheaper alternative to [traditional remittance services](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/stablecoins-for-remittances-a-potential-game-changer/). 



# What are the different types of stablecoins? 📚

As mentioned above, broadly speaking, there are two types of stablecoins. First, let’s examine **collateralized stablecoins**, which are crypto assets backed by reserves of different assets, such as fiat currencies, commodities or cryptocurrencies. 

# Fiat and commodity-backed stablecoins

# Fiat-backed stablecoins operate in the same way as other digital assets, except that they aim to be pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis. 

Stablecoins exist on multiple different blockchains, and can be [bridged between chains](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-blockchain-bridge). This enables users to seamlessly move capital around as they might with other assets.

Because of the transparency afforded by blockchain technology, every stablecoin can be easily accounted for, which in some cases has resulted in [assets being frozen](https://therecord.media/tether-freezes-29-million-crypto-connected-to-scam-marketplace). 

The lifecycle of fiat-backed stablecoins typically follow the same five steps:

After completing KYC, an individual or entity deposits fiat currency into the issuer's bank account. 

1. The company then issues the stablecoins to the entity’s supplied wallet address. 
2. The stablecoins then enter the digital asset ecosystem for people to use. 
3. Users can redeem the stablecoins back into fiat currencies at their discretion by returning them to the issuer.
4. The stablecoins are then removed from circulation, returning the corresponding amount of fiat back to the holder’s bank account.



Note that fiat-backed stablecoins are not the same as central bank digital currencies, which are issued by central banks and not companies.

Fiat-backed stablecoins [dominate overall stablecoin activity](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/categories/stablecoins/?sh=5a068fd01cd0) for a few reasons:

* Despite [adverse media](https://cryptoslate.com/exclusive-inside-tethers-battle-with-fud-and-financial-resilience-reveals-ceo-paolo-ardoino/), they have performed their function reliably over a sustained period (Tether launched in 2014), which has engendered a robust sense of stability and trust. 
* Fiat-backed stablecoins are incredibly liquid and widely adopted by a huge variety of decentralized and centralized platforms. This allows traders to interact with these coins knowing that there will always be sufficient liquidity to swap them for other assets. 
* Unlike other variants of stablecoins, how they work and how they are backed is much more straightforward compared to their algorithmic equivalent. 
* Tether and Circle are required to [comply with regulation](https://coingeek.com/stablecoin-regulations-eyed-what-does-it-mean-for-tether/) and employ independent auditors to verify that the issuers combined assets exceed their combined liabilities.

A less popular variant of collateralized stablecoins are backed by fungible commodities such as gold, silver or oil. 

Rather than being pegged to a dollar or a euro, commodity-backed stablecoins represent a unit of a specific commodity, such as one Troy ounce of gold. 

As with fiat-backed stablecoins, the companies issuing these coins are expected to publish regular independent audits of their physical reserves to ensure holders that they can redeem their tokens for their equivalent value of the underlying asset. 

For those seeking exposure to commodities, these stablecoins enable users to do so without having to consider storage or portability. They are typically highly liquid, can be fractionalized and are issued by reputable firms.

There have been attempts to collateralize [oil](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oilcoin-the-worlds-first-legally-compliant-cryptocurrency-backed-by-oil-300569307.html) and [agricultural commodities](https://www.santander.com/en/press-room/press-releases/2022/03/santander-and-agrotoken-join-forces-to-offer-loans-secured-by-cryptoassets), but these projects have so far failed to gain any meaningful traction.

# Popular examples

Fiat and commodity stablecoins are backed by a 1:1 reserve of real-world assets, but how they are backed can differ slightly depending on the coin. The largest and most liquid examples are:

1. [Tether (USDT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/tether): with $123b in circulation, USDT is [backed by](https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=reports) a mixture of USD reserves (83.89%), secured loans (5.36%) precious metals (3.95%), Bitcoin (3.81%) and other investments (2.97%), at press time.
2. [USD Coin (USDC)](https://prices/usdc): with [$36.8b USDC in circulation](https://www.circle.com/transparency), backed by the equivalent value of US dollar denominated assets, totalling $37b, at press time.
3. [Tether Gold (XAUT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/tether-gold): issued by Tether, this gold-backed coin allows holders to redeem their tokens for physical gold which Tether states it will deliver to[ any address in Switzerland](https://gold.tether.to/).
4. [PAX Gold (PAXG)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pax-gold): Regulated by the New York Department for Financial Services, one PAX Gold token represents one fine Troy ounce of a gold bar. PAXG has significantly more [volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pax-gold/) than its competitors. 

Some other noteworthy examples are: 

* [Gemini USD (GUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/gemini-dollar)
* [Paxos USD (USDP)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pax-dollar)
* [Mountain Protocol USD (USDM)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/mountain-protocol-usd)
* [First Digital USD (FDUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/first-digital-usd)
* [Maker DAO’s DAI](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dai)
* [TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/true-usd)
* [Frax (FRAX)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/frax)

# Associated risks

In December 2023, S&P Global published its ‘[Stablecoin Stability Assessment](https://press.spglobal.com/2023-12-12-S-P-Global-Ratings-Launches-Stablecoin-Stability-Assessment)’, where it rated several prominent stablecoins, examining factors such as quality risks, collateralization, legal and regulatory framework, and redeemability to name a few. 

The findings of the report made the following stability assessments of the major stablecoins, from strongest to weakest::

1. USD Coin: 2 (strong)
2. Gemini Dollar: 2 (strong)
3. Pax Dollar: 2 (strong)
4. Dai: 4 (constrained)
5. First Digital USD: 4 (constrained)
6. Tether: 4 (constrained)
7. Frax: 5 (weak)
8. TrueUSD: 5 (weak)

Looking into the report, there are a few common risk factors that are assessed:

**Systemic Failure:** A depegging event occurs when a stablecoin’s value deviates from its underlying real-world asset. 

This has happened many times over the industry’s history, with perhaps the most recent major event being in March 2023, when USDC depegged in part due to [its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank](https://blog.ledn.io/en/usdc-depeg). As with many similar events, the situation was partially rectified by arbitrage traders who quickly bought up the distressed asset at a discount. 

**Regulation:** Fiat-backed stablecoins have come under considerable scrutiny over the years, and the degree to which punitive regulation can damage trust and stability is an ever-present concern.

**Counterparty Risk:** Something that has dogged Tether for many years is the alleged lack of transparency with regards to their reserves. In 2022, Tether was ordered by a U.S. judge to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT. One of the great risks inherent to all stablecoins is that users may someday find themselves unable to redeem their crypto stablecoins for the fiat collateral.

**Centralization:** Many of the major stablecoins are issued by centralized companies, which users have to trust to maintain sufficient reserves and act appropriately. Stablecoin transactions are not necessarily permissionless - companies have cooperated with law enforcement to [freeze assets on occasion](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/circle-confirms-freezing-100k-in-usdc-at-law-enforcements-request/).  


# Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins

# Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins operate very similarly to fiat-backed stablecoins with a few key differences. 

Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, these stablecoins are often over-collateralized, meaning more cryptocurrency is held in reserve or “pledged” than the stablecoin value issued. 

For example, a $1 cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin might require $2 worth of cryptocurrency in reserve. This means that even if the reserve currency backing the stablecoin were to decline by as much as 50%, it should still be able to maintain its peg. 

Maker DAI is an open-source platform that allows users to take out loans in the form of DAI, which is pegged to the value of 1 US dollar. DAI is collateralized by cryptocurrencies. 

Here’s how DAI works:

1. Users wanting to acquire DAI must first lock up their Ethereum or other assets into a smart contract. Over collateralization enables the stablecoin to hold its peg. 
2. Fungible DAI tokens are then generated, reflecting the amount of collateral pledged. The user is then free to deploy the DAI in any way that they see fit. 
3. If users want to recover their collateralized assets, they must return the DAI issued and pay a stability fee. 

Automated smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) dynamically manage supply by creating or burning DAI, and by liquidating positions where there is insufficient collateral. 

If you want to learn more about DAI, [this article by Kraken Learn](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dai) offers a more detailed explanation. 

# Popular examples

In addition to DAI, here are some other popular examples of crypto-backed stablecoins:

1. [Synthetix USD (SUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/susd)**:** Using its native SNX token as collateral, users can lock SNX tokens as collateral to mint sUSD, maintaining a collateralization ratio of 500% or higher. This high over-collateralization ratio is supposed to help absorb price fluctuations in SNX.
2. [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/wrapped-bitcoin): WBTC is a 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Each WBTC token is reportedly fully backed by an equivalent amount of Bitcoin held in custody.
3. [Decentralized USD (USD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/usdd): Introduced in May 2022, USDD is an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin pegged to 1 U.S. dollar.

# Associated risks

**Systemic risks:** There have been many instances where stablecoins have run into trouble from systemic failures, resulting from some form of exploit. 

Stablecoins depend on smart contracts, oracles and blockchain networks to work efficiently. A failure, bug, exploit or other issue with these smart contracts may lead to a failure in their ability to allow tokens to be redeemed for any underlying collateral, which could cause the stablecoin to de-peg. In March 2020, [‘Network congestion and high gas prices’](https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/) led to the theft of $8M in MakerDAO collateral. The destabilization of other stablecoins can have a knock-on effect; when USDC depegged in 2023, it also [resulted in the depegging of DAI](https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/ratings/research/101590839.pdf). 

Depegging can sometimes be resolved by smart contract-driven corrective measures which manage the supply, but this is not always the case. 

**Regulation:** The lack of a regulatory regime for decentralized applications, of which there is no centralized custodian, presents its own unique challenges and risks. It is unclear exactly how DeFi platforms will be regulated in future, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how punitive or restrictive any policies might be.

**Collateralization:** Because crypto-backed stablecoins use collateral that is highly volatile, there is always the possibility that a very sharp move down in price could cause liquidation—particularly when a single asset represents a significant portion of the overall pool of collateral. For example, USDC represents a significant portion of DAI’s collateral. If USDC de-pegs, or the issuer of USDC freezes USDC, this could cause DAI to de-peg. This is much less likely due to mandatory over-collateralization, but the risk always remains.   


# Algorithmic stablecoins

# Algorithmic stablecoins employ a variety of smart contract-based mechanisms to maintain a stable value by responding dynamically to supply and demand. 

Unlike asset-backed stablecoins which have reserves that act as collateralization, algorithmic stablecoins typically mint and burn coins to maintain a peg and are not backed by real world assets. Additionally, these may include a secondary bond token which can be bought and redeemed for the underlying stablecoin to assist with stabilizing its price through arbitrage.

Additionally, these may include a secondary bond token which can be bought and redeemed for the underlying stablecoin to assist with stabilizing its price through arbitrage.

Note that while DAI uses smart contracts to manage the supply and adjust the stability fee, it is not an algorithmic stablecoin because it is fully collateralized. Algorithmic stablecoins are fully dependent on algorithms to manage the peg. If demand for the token increases and exceeds $1, the supply is increased. Conversely, if demand falls, supply decreases.

**Popular examples**

Perhaps due to the unprecedented failure of Terra USD (UST) and the inherent complexities of algorithmic stablecoin, there are fewer coins of this ilk with any meaningful adoption. 

* [Ampleforth (AMPL)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/ampleforth) is an algorithmic stablecoin that “...is a price-stable but supply volatile cryptocurrency that targets the (2019) CPI-adjusted dollar.” Via a non-dilutive process known as ‘rebasing’, supply is programmatically increased or decreased using data feeds from [Chainlink (LINK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/chainlink). Therefore the supply is constantly expanding and contracting, with holders balances fluctuating on a daily basis. As a result, the stablecoin has repeatedly managed to return to its target price despite [challenging market conditions](https://docs.ampleforth.org/reports/ampleforth-network-durability). 

For a more detailed explanation of how Ampleforth works, [check out this guide](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-ampleforth-ampl) by Kraken Learn. 

# Associated risks

**Systemic Failure:** The greatest risk of using algorithmic stablecoins is that the rebasing system is unable to maintain the peg or completely fails. In May 2022, the $18b algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) had a catastrophic meltdown. In what appeared to be a targeted attack that preceded a miraculous [series of events](https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg), the UST stablecoin fatally depegged and the native LUNA token lost 96% of its value in a single day, erasing $28b from the Terra ecosystem. 

In summary, it is hard to overstate the significance of the role that stablecoins play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Stablecoins act as a bridge for traditional finance, facilitate cross-border payments and offer a fully collateralized, crypto-based medium of exchange with a stable value. The several variations of stablecoins are the lifeblood of decentralized finance, but investors should carefully consider how they work and the attached risks before deploying capital into them.

# Introduction

Ever tried to wrap your head around the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? If so, you’ve probably wondered how to keep your digital assets stable while still enjoying the benefits of blockchain technology. Enter stablecoins, the not-so-new players in the crypto game that promise to offer the best of both worlds—stability and decentralization.

***But what exactly are stablecoins, and why do they play such a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem? Let’s break it down.***

# Understanding Stablecoins



Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, usually a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience extreme price fluctuations, stablecoins aim to offer a stable, predictable value. This stability is achieved through various mechanisms, which we’ll explore in more detail later.

# Types of Stablecoins

Not all stablecoins are created equal. There are different types of stablecoins, each with its own method of maintaining stability. The main types are:

* **Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins**
* **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins**
* **Algorithmic Stablecoins**

# Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins

Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are backed by a reserve of fiat currency, such as the US dollar, held in a bank account. For every stablecoin issued, there is an equivalent amount of fiat currency in reserve. This ensures that the stablecoin can be redeemed at any time for its face value in fiat currency.

Examples of fiat-collateralized stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). These stablecoins are popular because they offer a simple and reliable way to maintain stability, but they also come with the risk of centralization since the reserve is controlled by a central entity.

# Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins



Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than fiat currency. To account for the volatility of the underlying collateral, these stablecoins are often over-collateralized, meaning that the value of the collateral exceeds the value of the stablecoins issued. For example, the DAI stablecoin is backed by Ethereum and other assets on the MakerDAO platform. While crypto-collateralized stablecoins are more decentralized than fiat-collateralized ones, they are also more complex and require sophisticated mechanisms to maintain their peg to the target value.

# Algorithmic Stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins take a different approach to maintaining stability. Instead of being backed by fiat or cryptocurrency, they rely on algorithms and smart contracts to automatically adjust the supply of the stablecoin in response to changes in demand. If the price of the stablecoin rises above the target value, the algorithm increases the supply to bring the price down. If the price falls below the target, the supply is reduced. Examples of algorithmic stablecoins include Ampleforth (AMPL) and TerraUSD (UST). While algorithmic stablecoins offer a high degree of decentralization, they also carry significant risks, as demonstrated by the collapse of TerraUSD in 2022.

# Why Stablecoins Matter

So, why should you care about stablecoins? In the ever-volatile world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins offer a safe harbor. They provide the stability needed for everyday transactions, making it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies for payments, savings, and other financial activities. Without stablecoins, the dream of a decentralized financial system would be much harder to achieve.

# Stablecoins as a Bridge to Traditional Finance



One of the most significant roles of stablecoins is their ability to bridge the gap between the cryptocurrency world and traditional finance. Because stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies, they can be easily integrated into existing financial systems. This makes it possible to use stablecoins for everything from remittances to trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, all without the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

# Use Cases of Stablecoins

Stablecoins are incredibly versatile, with a wide range of use cases that extend far beyond simple price stability. Here are some of the most common uses:

* **Remittances:** Sending money across borders can be expensive and slow, but stablecoins offer a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional remittance services.
* **Payments:** Stablecoins can be used for everyday purchases, providing the benefits of cryptocurrencies without the volatility.
* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Stablecoins play a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem, where they are used as collateral for loans, liquidity in trading pools, and as a stable store of value.

# Stablecoins in DeFi

The DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem has exploded in recent years, and stablecoins are at the heart of this growth. In DeFi, stablecoins are used to provide liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), as collateral for lending and borrowing platforms, and as a stable store of value in a world where volatility is the norm. Without stablecoins, many of the financial services offered by DeFi platforms would be impractical or impossible to achieve.

# Risks Associated with Stablecoins

While stablecoins offer many benefits, they are not without risks. Some of the key risks include:

* **Regulatory Risks:** As stablecoins grow in popularity, they have come under increased scrutiny from regulators. Governments are concerned about the potential for stablecoins to be used in money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities.
* **Centralization Risks:** Fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in particular, are vulnerable to centralization risks since they rely on a central entity to manage the reserve assets.
* **Market Risks:** Algorithmic stablecoins are especially prone to market risks, as demonstrated by the collapse of TerraUSD, which led to significant losses for investors.

# Regulation of Stablecoins

The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving, and there is significant uncertainty about how they will be regulated in the future. In some countries, regulators have taken a cautious approach, while in others, stablecoins are subject to strict rules. The challenge for regulators is to balance the need for innovation with the need to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. As the use of stablecoins continues to grow, we can expect to see more clarity and consistency in the regulatory approach.

# Stablecoins vs. Other Cryptocurrencies

How do stablecoins compare to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? The main difference is in their volatility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience significant price fluctuations, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value. This makes them more suitable for everyday transactions and as a store of value. However, stablecoins are not without their own risks, and the choice between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies will depend on your specific needs and risk tolerance.

# The Future of Stablecoins



What does the future hold for stablecoins? As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, stablecoins are likely to play an increasingly important role. We can expect to see more innovation in the design of stablecoins, with new approaches to maintaining stability and reducing risks. At the same time, the regulatory landscape will continue to evolve, with regulators seeking to strike a balance between innovation and consumer protection. Overall, stablecoins are poised to be a key component of the future of finance.

# Conclusion

Stablecoins have emerged as a crucial element of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing the stability needed for everyday transactions while bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional finance. Whether you’re using them for remittances, payments, or DeFi, stablecoins offer a versatile and valuable tool for navigating the digital economy. While they are not without risks, the benefits of stablecoins make them an essential part of the future of finance.

$Ampl - $Spot update - Base and Vault V2,u_ObnoxiousTwit,1blgf8w,2024-03-22 21:41:47,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ObnoxiousTwit/comments/1blgf8w/ampl_spot_update_base_and_vault_v2/,ObnoxiousTwit,,"Post was removed from r/cc for rule 5.1 (not likely to be of interest to the broader community). Sure, no one would want to know why or how a top 250 token would be up 400% in the past two months, and continues its streak while the whole market waffles and crabs. So posting it here  instead. Probably won't get any views, but hey, I'm doing my part.

&#x200B;

As you may recall from my last post - or may not, given the 0 upvotes it received - $Ampl MC was around $100m and the price dipping from $1.50ish. A few days of negative rebases happened early in the year, but it's been quite the uphill (in a good way) ride since then. We are now sitting at $330m MC and cracked the top 250 tokens by MC. Lots of big buys on uniswap, as well as some new activity to report.

&#x200B;

First up, Base, the L2 created by Coinbase, now has $Spot and $Wampl available on chain, thanks to Aerodrome (whom Coinbase also has a stake in). Both are listed for trade on Aerodrome. Then this happened:

&#x200B;

[What could it mean?](https://preview.redd.it/mtj5q4xxmzpc1.jpg?width=941&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0ecfd052a4a819d64e72cf2c76658f84fdc5546)

We'll see if anything comes of it, I certainly want lower fees for trades, and I feel like Coinbase has such name recognition that when they do something it tends to carry an air of legitimacy, especially for non-crypto nerds.

&#x200B;

I'm also wondering if this nice little pop for $Spot had anything to do with this news.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ow3ymhj0nzpc1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=a16ada09aa4dff2674c72c211aae2b099f4efd9e

$Spot had been hovering at $1.14-1.15 for the majority of the past few weeks, but this news, and the continued hoarding of positive rebases meant the only place to purchase $Ampl (\~$1.80-2.50 per token) was to buy $Spot for $1.15 and the redeem it for the underlying $Ampl. With large enough buys, that kind of arbitrage can be lucrative.

&#x200B;

And for those of you who don't want to calculate rebase taxes, you can get in on the action with $Wampl, Wrapped Ampleforth - no supply fluctuations, all the supply and price changes are reflected in the token price alone. So if you want exposure to Ampl without the burden of calculating rebase taxes, it's a standard erc-20 token and is available on Coinbase and uniswap.

&#x200B;

The next bit of news is the imminent release of Spot Rollover Vault V2. This has a few offerings, including immediate withdrawal (vs 4 week unlock period) of unlocked assets from the vault (for a fee, paid to vault holders), and creates immediate arbitrage for the $Spot:$Ampl price differences.

&#x200B;

And lastly, here's a chart of the $Wampl price over the past year:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hnka3um1nzpc1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e704d6548d4540ac5c7442161c5143505b4af3

The positive rebases ($Ampl supply expansion period) began early October, with $Wampl at around $2 in September. if you feel like reading my previous posts, or just researching what $Ampl and $Spot are doing for the ecosystem, you will see that there's really nothing else quite like it currently being built.

But before we all jump on the DeFi bandwagon, it's important to take a closer look at the current state of the industry. Are you ready for the hard truth?

&#x200B;

**Spoiler alert:** it's not all sunshine and rainbows. In fact, it's more like a collapsing house of cards (just like Luna, Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital).

&#x200B;

* But hey, there are still some opportunities to be found, if you're brave enough to search for them. Just don't expect everything to be perfectly decentralized.
* The pessimistic nature of this article wasn’t meant to dissuade you but instead to inform you.
* The author of this article loves sarcasm and may present statements that could offend a crypto diehard. But, rest assured. He is a firm believer in the blockchain revolution.

&#x200B;

**First thing’s first, CeFi:** It's no secret that the world of centralized finance (CeFi) in the crypto industry is often opaque and full of hidden leverage. Just like in traditional finance, it's tough to know exactly what's going on behind the scenes.

&#x200B;

* But in 2021 and 2022, the CeFi industry really hit a rough patch. First, there was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading at a discount to its net asset value (NAV).
* You see, GBTC was a way for accredited investors to make some easy money by shorting bitcoin and buying GBTC at NAV (net asset value), then selling it for a premium after a six-month lockup.
* But when other regulated options for accessing bitcoin exposure became available, that GBTC premium disappeared and traders were caught off guard.
* Suddenly, they had big bitcoin short positions and GBTC long positions, leading to a major liquidity crunch. Some firms went bankrupt, others needed bailouts, and it was all because of the lack of transparency in the CeFi industry.
* It was tough to figure out exactly what was going on and how it would impact the wider crypto market. But one thing's for sure: it wasn't pretty.

&#x200B;

**Ba Dum Tss, DeFi:** The DeFi craze has swept the crypto world by storm, with Ethereum and BNB Chain leading the charge in decentralized exchanges and deposit/lenders.

&#x200B;

* While DeFi proponents tout the potential for new, transparent financial systems, others have pointed out the risks of counterparty risk, custodian problems, and the possibility of liquidation if asset prices drop too low.
* And let's not forget the criticism that DeFi is mostly just circular and speculative, with little real-world utility.
* But hey, at least you can earn yield on your stablecoin deposits and trade them for equity/governance tokens on decentralized exchanges, right?

&#x200B;

**The Infamous Exploits:** From DeFi hacks that allow for sneaky arbitrage opportunities to the risk of code exploits and loss of funds, this decentralized finance ecosystem is not for the faint of heart.

&#x200B;

* And let's not forget about the added danger of smart contracts from different blockchains interacting with each other.
* All in all, it's important to remember that DeFi carries a hefty risk for those who decide to dip their toes into its waters, so be sure to weigh that risk against any potential yield.
* In the past 2.5 years alone, over $2.5 billion worth of crypto assets has been exploited from smart contracts.

&#x200B;

**Greed is Good:** DeFi is all about the collateral, baby! Whether you're depositing your crypto assets to earn yield or using them as collateral to borrow other assets, you've got to make sure you're protected from the risk of smart contract exploits. And let's be real, who doesn't love a little collateralized lending?

&#x200B;

* But seriously, chasing yield in the volatile world of crypto can be a risky business, so it's always a good idea to be over-collateralized to protect yourself.
* On the other hand, CeFi (centralized finance) may offer a mix of collateralized and non-collateralized lending, but it also has the added benefit of being less susceptible to smart contract exploits.
* Just remember, stablecoins can be useful for saving and making payments in developing countries, but be sure to watch out for counterparty risks and the need for more transparency when it comes to collateral.
* And hey, let's not forget the true utility of bitcoin: self-custody and permissionless payments. That's the real reason we're all in this crazy crypto game, right?

&#x200B;

[Another random image from the internet in case you get bored reading](https://preview.redd.it/0g1dldepme7a1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3f78107b96b84b34f273162a8766ae9814e93c8)

&#x200B;

**Now** **wait just a minute:** DeFi is all about decentralization. No more big brother!

&#x200B;

* Well, not exactly. While the goal of decentralized finance is to provide a more transparent and efficient financial system, the reality is that many DeFi protocols have centralized aspects that can be exploited.
* For example, Ethereum's code contained ""difficulty bombs"" for years that gave more power to the head developers and reduced the power of miners and node operators.
* And the Binance Smart Chain can be paused by Binance if something goes wrong. Even proof-of-stake protocols, which are supposed to be decentralized, can be oligopolistic due to the high technical and financial barriers to becoming a validator.
* Plus, many smart contract blockchains have high processing, storage, and bandwidth requirements, making it difficult for individuals to run their own nodes. As a result, many users and apps rely on third-party node operators like Infura and Alchemy, which can compromise the decentralization of the network.
* And let's not forget about flash loans and frontrunning, which can be used to manipulate prices and cause liquidity issues. So, while DeFi is certainly an exciting development, it's important to be aware of its centralized vulnerabilities.

&#x200B;

**The All-Too-Common Single Point of Failure:** Despite DeFi's promise of decentralization, many of its use cases rely on centralized entities, particularly custodial stablecoins, and other centralized assets.

&#x200B;

* These stablecoins, like USDT and USDC, are issued by centralized entities but can be traded efficiently by holders.
* However, this centralized control can be a weakness, as seen in the case of Wrapped Bitcoin on Solana where the issuer went bankrupt and the custodial assets lost most of their value.
* DeFi protocols on Ethereum also heavily use Wrapped Bitcoin, a centralized product with bearer assets that could potentially suffer a similar fate.
* Additionally, DeFi protocols can be vulnerable to flash loans and frontrunning, leading to liquidity issues and price manipulation.

&#x200B;

**Stablecoins, oh stablecoins:** Everyone's favorite way to try and avoid the volatility of the crypto market - stablecoins, which aim to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a real-world asset like the US dollar, aren’t even entirely immune to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

&#x200B;

* Some stablecoin developers have tried to mitigate this risk by creating synthetic stablecoins, like MakerDAO's DAI, which is backed by an over-collateralized amount of ether and balanced with a stabilization algorithm. However, using a volatile asset like ether as collateral for a stablecoin can lead to sudden liquidations and high transaction fees in tumultuous market periods.
* In an effort to avoid these issues, newer crypto-collateralized stablecoins like Liquity and Zero aim to be 100% crypto-collateralized through incentive mechanisms.
* On the other hand, there's Ampleforth's AMPL, a volatile elastic supply stablecoin that adjusts its supply to maintain price stability, but whose governance process has faced criticism for being too centralized and whose price stability has been questionable.
* But stablecoins aren't the only thing to worry about in the DeFi world - there are also flash loans and frontrunning to consider. Flash loans allow users to borrow large amounts of assets and manipulate prices, while frontrunning involves traders gaining an advantage by seeing pending transactions and placing their own orders ahead of them.
* The DeFi landscape is constantly evolving with new protocols popping up every other month, and it pays to stay vigilant.

&#x200B;

**And then there’s the problem with data:** DeFi enthusiasts may tout the decentralized nature of their smart contracts and protocols, but let's not forget the elephant in the room: oracles.

&#x200B;

* These centralized sources of information are like the bossy older sibling of the DeFi world, telling the contracts what to do and how to behave.
* The reliance on oracles does raise some concerns about control and exploitation. So before you go all in on that fancy DeFi protocol, make sure you know who's really calling the shots.

&#x200B;

[Are you still with me?](https://preview.redd.it/tvj6pno6ne7a1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=25a8eb1fefe30327a1351609a9dc19611cfef6aa)

&#x200B;

**Man, you’re so sad. It’s about being democratic**: Yeah, in theory, but it seems like every time a new DeFi protocol comes out, it comes with some kind of centralization issue.

&#x200B;

* Whether it's the smart contract blockchains having some centralized elements, or the use of oracles, or the centralized web-based user interfaces and companies supporting them, there's always some sort of point of centralization that raises concerns.
* And then there’s the issue with governance - it's usually held by whales and voter turnout is low, leading to more control by a small group of highly active and incentivized parties. Did you really think your $1,000 investment matters?
* It's no wonder DeFi protocols are facing increasing scrutiny and regulation - there are just too many centralization issues to ignore. Maybe one day we'll see a truly decentralized DeFi protocol, but until then, it seems like we'll just have to deal with all these centralization issues while scrapping for yields.

&#x200B;

**Too long didn’t read, I guess:** Despite attempting to address issues in traditional finance, DeFi environments still have multiple layers of centralization, including validator oligopolies and developer control in the smart contract layer, the need for centralized oracles for external data, and centralized governance structures.

&#x200B;

* Many DeFi protocols rely on centralized stablecoins and web-based interfaces, making them vulnerable to regulation and control by centralized entities.
* DeFi protocols also often have governance tokens that are held by a small number of wealthy individuals and subject to low voter turnout, leading to potential manipulation and a lack of true decentralization.
* While DeFi offers smart contract environments for trading and leveraging crypto assets, it does not solve the need for centralized exchanges in the fiat onramp process. Instead, bitcoin's main utility lies in its ability to facilitate decentralized, secure, and immutable self-custodianship and permissionless payments.

&#x200B;

**The Bottom Line:** DeFi isn't as decentralized as it might seem. While it offers smart contract environments for trading and leveraging crypto assets, it doesn't solve the centralization problem of fiat onboarding through exchanges.

&#x200B;

* In conclusion, DeFi might seem like a revolutionary solution to the centralization problems in traditional finance, but it's important to remember that it's not without its own set of vulnerabilities.
* From smart contract exploits and flash loans to frontrunning and centralized governance, there are plenty of pitfalls to watch out for.
* So if you're considering dipping your toes into the wild world of DeFi, make sure you DYOR and understand the risks before you put your hard-earned crypto on the line.
* Otherwise, you might just find yourself in a sticky situation that's anything but decentralized. But hey, at least you'll have a funny story to tell (if you can laugh about it). Just be careful out there, fellow future millionaires!
* I am not cynical. I am just a realist but an optimist by heart."

Coinbase Dust,CryptoCurrency,x01sg7,2022-08-28 14:05:18,6,0.69,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/x01sg7/coinbase_dust/,PWHerman89,DISCUSSION,"A little while back I noticed that I now have a bunch of tiny little dust balances of a number of coins on Coinbase. Possibly from swapping random coins I got from Earn. All of the dollar values though are effectively 0. Anyone know of a way to get rid of these? It’s just super annoying to see them all there with my handful of real coins that I hold.

They didn’t use to be there, it’s something that must have changed in a recent update or something. I’m talking like 0.0000001 MLN, etc. Some of them I really don’t think I ever opened, like Wrapped Ampleforth? I don’t think that was ever offered in earn? I know it doesn’t really matter, I just like a clean interface!

EDIT: I contacted support and they sent me the email below. I asked them to zero the balances, I will report back on whether they actually do it or not!


Thanks for contacting us.

I'm a specialist here at Coinbase and your case was escalated to us. I'm here to assist you with your Coinbase funds.

The small balance that’s leftover in your wallet is known as dust. Dust occurs when the amount left in your wallet can’t cover the blockchain network fee as well as the fee for selling that crypto.

You have four options to manage dust:
1. You can send the leftover amount to a different Coinbase user’s email.
2. You can leave the leftover funds in your wallet and do nothing with them.
3. If you wish to close your account, you can donate your leftover funds to GiveCrypto. GiveCrypto (https://www.givecrypto.com) is a nonprofit that distributes cryptocurrency to people in need.
- To donate to GiveCrypto, click on ‘Donate Balance’ on the ‘Close Account’ page
- Please note that accounts can't be closed from the Coinbase mobile app, and requests must be done from a web browser. More details here: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/update-my-account/how-can-i-close-my-account
4. You can forfeit the funds and allow Coinbase to zero out the balances. If you wish to forfeit the funds, we'll need you to explicitly request this when replying to this email.

Regards,
Coinbase Support"
