Liquid Staking. Different alternatives to earn yield from your $AVAX!,Avax,1gx8qpa,2024-11-22 09:12:59,2,0.63,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/1gx8qpa/liquid_staking_different_alternatives_to_earn/,juanpiromanok12,Finance,"# Want to get the best out of AVAX but not sure where to start?

**Let me give you some options to increase yields.**

https://i.redd.it/8ngzbyxzmg2e1.gif

**Two key concepts that you need to learn to boost your returns on AVAX are Staking and Restaking.**

* **Staking:** When staking, you retain liquidity. This allows you to stake your tokens and get a derivative token in exchange (e.g., Staked AVAX), which you can use to stake in other DeFi apps. As a result, you'll be able to earn extra rewards (for staking, yield farming, etc).
* **Restaking:** Restaking is using the derivative tokens you received from liquid staking to stake again. This will maximize potential earnings across multiple layers.

https://preview.redd.it/qafxpvl2ng2e1.jpg?width=1748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e042d0ee0091f9be7422f939502f5319f4ec1b5f

**But what are the benefits?**

* **Increased liquidity:** You can still access your capital and benefit from staking rewards at the same time.
* **Optimized returns:** Amplify your returns by restaking.
* **Flexibility:** Trade or use your assets without having to wait for an unstaking period.

https://i.redd.it/kwx1u2k4ng2e1.gif

**To help you boost your returns, DeFi protocols like Gogopool, Benqi, and Suzaku, among others, are a smart option.**

https://preview.redd.it/ssz35me8ng2e1.jpg?width=1748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=717b0f646503022e23ba40806e4e8e5bdd6a474f

**Suzaku will help you to enhance the security and scalability of Avalanche L1 networks.**

This protocol facilitates restaking, which allows you to reuse staked tokens—an innovative approach, if you ask me.

By restaking, validators can keep their AVAX tokens staked to secure the main network while using the same tokens to support activities in subnets or additional services without compromising core security.

With the Avax9000 programme, Avalanche has reinforced its infrastructure to accommodate these features.  
Suzaku’s implementation of restaking positions the network as both a fast platform and a highly adaptable ecosystem, attracting developers and projects that value security, performance, and decentralization.

https://i.redd.it/sxbupvqang2e1.gif

**As for GoGoPool and BenQi, these are both key players in providing liquid staking solutions for the Avalanche ecosystem.**

* **GoGoPool:** Focuses on enhancing liquidity, security, and decentralization by allowing users to stake AVAX while maintaining access to their staked funds for further DeFi activities. It fosters liquidity and staking power, essential for Avalanche's growth, while aiming to expand its infrastructure to support Avalanche's scaling.
* **BenQi:** Offers a dual-purpose liquid staking solution. By tokenizing staked AVAX, BenQi provides yield-bearing assets that can be reinvested into other DeFi protocols for additional returns. It's also recognized for its lending and borrowing capabilities, making it versatile for liquidity and yield generation.

https://i.redd.it/1u5z6iufng2e1.gif

With the Avalanche 9000 update, we can expect both GoGoPool and BenQi to advance with the network’s **enhanced scalability**, **low-cost transactions**, and **speed**, resulting in better liquid staking services and furthering their role in Avalanche's DeFi ecosystem.

Benqi liquid staked AVAX staking is a great strategy for those who want to earn AVAX rewards, but also maintain full liquidity. sAVAX is a tradeable receipt of AVAX locked through Benqi, the most popular liquid staking protocol for Avalanche.

What do YOU use Avax for?,Avax,1cwiykv,2024-05-20 11:56:02,31,0.92,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/1cwiykv/what_do_you_use_avax_for/,CopynCat,Discussion,"Question is the title. I’ve been in crypto for almost a decade now. Haven’t made any money from it, only lost. I’m 25, I have a computer science degree. 

I’ve looked up use cases for Avax, what does it actually do that is so REVOLUTIONARY and necessary for society?

But before you answer that question, why do you hold AVAX? I have about 50 AVAX right now, I’m holding it because I believe the price will go up eventually. But what actual use does it have? I know I can lend on BENQI, I have 50,000 QI. But that once again is the same purposes, TO MAKE MONEY. But that money has to come from somewhere… the people who buy after me. That is not a use case.

What Do YOU use AVAX for that warrants the price and Multibillion dollar market cap. How does it benefit YOUR life, not some random villagers in Africa, the #1 USE CASE on the AVAX website. That sounds soooo shady haha.

99% of crypto is a scam, how is this any different besides the huge market cap; with only 50% of the circulating supply currently out?"

**For the various links to Benqi and to see the FAQs please read this on our** [blog](https://www.atlas-staking.com/stake-qi-and-vote-with-veqi/)**.**  

Be sure to check out our AVAX liquid staking tutorials using [Core wallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/1btb3no/avalanche_liquid_staking_using_core_wallet/) and [Metamask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/1bv2ywq/avalanche_liquid_staking_using_metamask/). They are right here on Reddit.

So, you have supplied tokens and provided liquidity to Benqi and now have QI tokens as your reward. The question is, “*What do I do with my QI tokens?*“

The four most obvious choices are to let them sit idle on the blockchain, swap them for a different token, provide them as liquidity on a DEX, or stake them back on Benqi.

1. Allowing them to sit idle on the blockchain is a great option for those who prefer full liquidity. Remember, the tokens are never in your wallet. They’re always on the blockchain. Your wallet holds the keys to unlock your address and move your tokens.

2. If you don’t care about your QI tokens and believe a different token may wind up being a more valuable asset, you might swap them.

3. Lending them out to liquidity pools is a way to generate income from your tokens.

4. Staking your QI tokens on the Benqi platform gives you vote-escrowed QI (veQI) as your “receipt.” This veQI allows you to direct where Benqi stakes its AVAX and boost the APY of your favorite validators.

In this article, we will show you **how to stake QI tokens** on the Benqi platform and then vote for your favorite validator.

## Why you should stake your QI tokens

There is additional risk when liquid staking on any platform. You not only have the risks associated with the underlying crypto, but also absorb the risks of the liquid staking platform. If the liquid staking platform is hacked the derivative tokens will plummet in value as people scramble to sell them.

Because of these risks, we usually tell the average crypto investor not to liquid stake more than 25% of your portfolio. DEGENS often liquid stake their whole bag as they actively look to generate as much yield as possible and are comfortable with the risk.

If you follow our advice, you would have 75% of your AVAX traditionally staked with a validator. Staking your QI and then using your veQI to vote can help your validator and boost their staking yield. That means you get more AVAX tokens for staking with them!

## Why you should vote using your veQI tokens

Remember, staking QI gives you veQI, which is a representation of your voting power. Voting with your veQI tells the Benqi platform where you would like them to stake the AVAX that people deposit for the liquid staking derivative, sAVAX. 

By voting, you turbocharge the staking yield of your validator. That means more AVAX tokens in your pocket!

## How to stake Benqi (QI) tokens

Here’s a **step-by-step QI staking tutorial**. We assume you already have QI tokens. If not, check out our Core wallet AVAX liquid staking tutorial or Metamask AVAX liquid staking tutorial to see how to get some.

**For the various links to Benqi and to see the FAQs please read this on our** [**blog**](https://www.atlas-staking.com/avalanche-liquid-staking-using-metamask/)**.** 

## How does liquid staking work?

AVAX staking requires you to lockup your tokens, usually in intervals of 3, 6, 9, or 12 months. This might not work for you. You may want your funds to stay liquid.

DeFi users generally want full liquidity, so they can quickly swap or lend out their tokens to earn extra yield. That’s where liquid staking plays a crucial role. Avalanche Liquid staking on Benqi allows you to convert your AVAX into liquid staked sAVAX tokens. 

sAVAX tokens earn AVAX staking rewards by simply existing on-chain. You do not need to do anything with them. 

Benqi is the original and most widely used AVAX liquid staking protocol. The protocol also enables you to supply other assets, like WBTC, USDC, and USDT to earn Benqi’s native QI tokens. 

Additionally, QI tokens can be earned by supplying your liquid staked sAVAX back to Benqi. You can generate even more yield by depositing AVAX, receiving sAVAX in return, and then supplying your sAVAX back to Benqi.

What do you do with your QI tokens? You can stake them to earn more QI. Plus, QI stakers can vote for their favorite validators to boost their AVAX staking yield.

**If you have staked your QI tokens, please vote for our Node ID: MmTfUacXsPdKryR3WkVteMqoFvyxEdYf4**  
Here's our AVAX validator node's page on [Avascan](https://avascan.info/staking/validator/NodeID-MmTfUacXsPdKryR3WkVteMqoFvyxEdYf4).

 

## Is liquid staking risky?

Liquid staking has additional risks to consider. That’s the nature of all derivatives. You not only bear the risks associated with the Avalanche network and AVAX token, but you bear the additional risk of the liquid staking provider getting hacked, getting taken over by malicious governance, going insolvent, etc.

For the average crypto investor it’s prudent to limit liquid staking derivatives to 25% of your holdings. DeFi users are often comfortable with a much higher percentage.

That’s it! Your AVAX tokens are liquid staked and your sAVAX tokens provide full liquidity while also earning staking rewards.

## What do I do with sAVAX tokens?

You can simply let your newly minted sAVAX tokens sit idle at your wallet address. You can use them to supply liquidity to a DEX. Or, you can lend them back to Benqi to earn QI tokens!

### Supply sAVAX to Benqi and earn QI tokens

Benqi needs liquidity so people can liquid stake their AVAX tokens. If you lend your sAVAX back to the platform they will pay you with QI tokens. You can then stake your QI to earn even more QI tokens! It’s a common strategy to earn extra yield. 

When you stake your QI tokens, you receive vote escrowed QI as your receipt (veQI). Those veQI tokens allow you to vote for your favorite validators and direct where Benqi stakes its AVAX. That boosts the validator’s AVAX staking yield.

**For the various links to Benqi and to see the FAQs please read this on our** [**blog**](https://www.atlas-staking.com/avalanche-liquid-staking-using-core-wallet/)**.**

# What is the point of liquid staking?

Staking AVAX tokens requires you to lockup your tokens for a set amount of time. Validators must lock their tokens up too, usually intervals of 3, 6, 9, or 12 months. 

This doesn’t work for everyone. DEGENS often like full liquidity, so they can quickly trade or lend out their tokens to earn extra yield. That’s where liquid staking comes in. Benqi is the OG and most popular AVAX liquid staking protocol.

Avalanche Liquid staking on Benqi allows you to swap your AVAX for sAVAX tokens. sAVAX tokens accrue AVAX rewards simply by sitting on chain. You don’t have to do anything with them. 

The Benqi platform also allows you to supply other assets, like USDT, USDC, and WBTC to earn QI tokens. The QI token is Benqi’s native utility and governance token.

QI tokens can also be earned by supplying Benqi with your liquid staked sAVAX. Many people generate additional yield by depositing their AVAX, receiving sAVAX in return, and then supplying their sAVAX back to Benqi. This would allow you to earn AVAX and QI rewards.

Your QI tokens can then be staked to earn more QI. And, staking your QI allows you to vote and boost the AVAX staking yield for your favorite validators.

**If you are staking your QI tokens, please vote for Atlas Staking. Our Node ID: MmTfUacXsPdKryR3WkVteMqoFvyxEdYf4**Here's our validator node's page on [Avascan](https://avascan.info/staking/validator/NodeID-MmTfUacXsPdKryR3WkVteMqoFvyxEdYf4).

## Is liquid staking risky?

Liquid staking does carry extra risk. All derivatives do. You not only have the risks associated with the AVAX token, but you have the extra risk of the liquid staking provider getting hacked, or going insolvent, etc. 

So, for the average crypto investor we recommend no more than 25% of your holdings in liquid staking derivatives. DEGENS are usually comfortable with a much higher percentage.

## How to liquid stake AVAX using Core wallet

Core wallet is the preferred wallet for the Avalanche ecosystem. In this step-by-step tutorial we will show you *how to liquid stake AVAX on Benqi using Core wallet*. It’s a piece of cake! **Remember, you will need AVAX tokens for gas.**

**1.** Navigate to [https://staking.benqi.fi/stake](https://staking.benqi.fi/stake). (see image below)

That’s it! You have liquid staked your AVAX tokens and have full liquidity while also earning staking rewards.

However, you can earn extra yield by supplying your sAVAX tokens back to the Benqi platform. The extra yield is paid in Benqi’s native, QI token.

## Supply sAVAX to Benqi and earn QI tokens

Benqi needs liquidity so people can liquid stake their AVAX tokens. If you lend your sAVAX back to the platform they will pay you with QI tokens. You can then stake your QI to earn even more QI tokens! It’s a common strategy to earn extra yield.

I must admit I have been blindsighted by it a bit. I did not expect a sustained rally like this from Hsuite. I am always reluctant to risk money on small projects but Hsuite might have some long term legs (if they can focus a bit on the UX ). It could have been a good idea to tug away 100K or so HSUITE just for fun. 

I do not generally trust DeFI platform's native tokens. They usually get a hype pump and then their necessary tokenomics pulls them down (Have a look at BenQi and their token Qi). Sauce and Hsuite have been performing well but they are too young in this space yet. But I think with uniswap v3 and Saucerswap v2 contracts native tokens will have less pressure with targeted liquidity ranges. 

This helps because with narrow liquidity ranges providing liquidity can sustain attractive APRs  and DEFI projects do not rely on Reward's pools (usually grants from the native network) to attract liquidity providers. I do not have the time to maange multiple stakes in LPs, monitoring price ranges, actively adjusting my liquidity on the DEX.  But for those that have the time and financial literacy, this is an exciting time to generate some great returns."

AVAX Liquid staking protocols and ACP-13 are trying to lower the cost of Subnet validators,Avax,181evza,2023-11-22 12:39:44,11,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/181evza/avax_liquid_staking_protocols_and_acp13_are/,Mr__Hyde__,🔺 AVAX Staking,"I've had a few friends and people online ask me about Subnet validators so I wanted to break down  ACP-13 and the state of Liquid Staking AVAX. Gonna try to keep this simple and straightforward

What's ACP-13 All About?

In essence, ACP-13 is a proposal that's looking to reshape how AVAX Validators, Subnets, and the Primary network interact. Here's a quick rundown of some key proposed changes:

- No More 2,000 AVAX Minimum: Validators won't need to hold 2,000 AVAX to participate.
- Optional Primary Network Validation: Validators can choose whether they want to validate the primary network.
- Stake & Earn on Subnets: You can now stake your AVAX directly to specific Subnets and earn rewards from those Subnets, specifically on the P-chain.

check out this longer explainer on Reddit: [ACP-13 Detailed Discussion](https://reddit.com/r/Avax/comments/17fp9th/avalanche_discussing_tokenomics_changes_to_scale/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (I think it's stickied on the sub)

Liquid Staking AVAX

There's been a lot of movement in the Liquid Staking space within AVAX, particularly with GoGoPool and Benqi Finance's Ignite protocol. Each work a bit diff:

- GoGoPool (GGP) Node Operators: They're slashing the $AVAX staking requirements by about 50%. Operators bring their hardware and stake 1,000 AVAX plus 100 AVAX worth of $GGP. They get to earn AVAX staking rewards, operating fees, and GGP rewards.
- $QI Ignite: This one's a bit different. It uses $sAVAX and offers two options:
    1. Partial Staking: Reduces the node requirement to spin up a validator by roughly 75-90%.
    2. Fee-Based Rental Model: This option earns zero rewards but doesn't expose you to AVAX risk beyond the payment.

AvaCloud  (more so for Enterprises and Startups)

AvaCloud makes web3 business solutions rlly easy, for example managing validators for their Subnet, building bespoke blockchain solutions, data tools, and other cool stuff Avalanche offers. I would check them out if it makes sense.

Hopefully that clears up any questions. I plan on sending a link to this post for any friends or anons on X who ask LOL. Happy thanksgiving"

Reward APR reduction having an effect on deFi TVL,Hedera,15wcbs5,2023-08-20 10:05:54,13,0.85,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/15wcbs5/reward_apr_reduction_having_an_effect_on_defi_tvl/,m_e_sek,Discussion,"I just wanted to make a quick observation. I know that others commented on this as well. But here it goes.

On August 4, 2023 , right before GC annoucnement about staking APR changes were announced, HBAR was trading at around $0.053 and on Saucerswap liquidity on HBAR-USDC pool was hovering around  $1M (regualrly down to $900K.

Today, the HBAR price is around $0.063 (about 20% higher comapred to begining of August) and the HBAR-USDC pool on Saucerswap is at around 1.5M. Just based on price action we would expect it to be around 10% higher at $1.1M (as HBAR constitutes only one leg of the pair). 

I do not follow HBAR-SAUCE that closely but before the APR change went into effect liquidy was hovering around $3.3M and now it's at $4.8M

To me this has both positive and negative implications.

**Positive:**

* DeFi is the retail crypto drug. One of the easiest ways of luring people onto a platform is through  DeFI projects. Many are unsustainable pipedreams but  eventually a high volume trade and swap platform can sustain a decent payout. Saucerswap may or may not evolve into a fully sustainable model but having increased liquidity increases stability and the positive perception. At one point in 2021, BenQi on Avalanche had reached over 2 billion in TVL (AVAX was at $120 at the time so the total amount of their TVL dod not change much in terms of AVAX, it currently sits at around 140 M). The huge liquidity on the pools was what lured me to consider dipping my toes in Avalanche. And Benqi has been one of the few platforms that kept on going (relatively) strong. Contrast this with the recent liquidity farming experiment of Pangolin on Hedera. As soon as super farms were dried out of grant money a few whales removed liquidity and the entire system fell in disarray. Currently the APRs are reasonable perhaps but TVL is so low, I would not touch it with a ten foot pole. NOTE: Defi is extremely risky at whatever liquidity level. Never invest anythnig on DEFI that is not money you can throw away. Many a Terra Luna investor are still crying.
* Hbar on liquidity pools remove Hbar staked for rewards, hence buttressing the sustainability of the reward rate (due to lower emissions)
* Highly liquid DEX's and liquidity farms can help decrease the dominance of CEXs like Coinbase and Binance. In my opinion large custodial accounts are the greatest danger to any POS network. Binance probably holds the most Hbar outside GC members and founders. 

**Negative**

* Staked Hbar provides security to the network. it may not be relevant now (we are still permissioned) but in the future running a node and staking on a node must be either significantly safer than liquidity farming (which is) or lucrative enough to compete with alternative ways of earning passive income through Hbar. This is required to keep nodes staked well and in a decentralized manner. Any Hbar kept on a custodial wallet (e.g. on Binance) or on a DeFi project lowers the potential security. We are a long way from this being an issue but the network must remain attractive enough for people to stake their Hbar if we are ever going to become a truly permissionless network.
* Even Saucerswap (as cautious and well managed have they been) is not under Hedera control. An exploit in a DeFi platform that affects a large number of users and a large amount of Hbar could do a lot of damage to the public (and enterprise level) perception of the network. An exploit that affects a few hundred people and a few thousand dollars worth of Hbar is not the same as an exploit that affects hundreds of thousands of users and lead to a loss of millions of dollars. Such things will happen. Hedera network itself can be safe from being manipulated or hacked but any network that allows smart contracts to be built on top will always be sensitive to damages resulting from third party vulnerabilities. Some platforms will lack proper security, they will have buggy contracts...this is inevitable. And at an early stage, such things can have lasting effects on Hedera itself. I mean, people cannot even distinguish between POW and POS networks (let alone grasp some fundemantal facts about Hedera). Do we think they will be able to (or willing to) distinguish a smart contract vulnerability from network's inherent security?

Question about Staking Tokens like qisAVAX.,BENQI,11wlz8s,2023-03-20 11:34:51,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BENQI/comments/11wlz8s/question_about_staking_tokens_like_qisavax/,CryptoGrak,,"I'm trying to parse out how this works, because I'm not sure I am looking at it right.

I staked AVAX with Benqi and received sAVAX, which makes sense.

I supplied the sAVAX as collateral on Benqi in the deposit side (about 100 sAVAX).  Against this, I took out a borrow position of a small amount ($600 USDT, about 30% LTV) to use for some LP positions on Vector.  The way I understand this, my sAVAX is ""locked"" into Benqi as my collateral until I repay my loan.

However, I'm assuming as a staking token, I received about 5000 qisAVAX, I'm assuming serving as my claim check to get my sAVAX back once the loan is paid.

But on Yeti finance, it seems I can deposit the qisAVAX as collateral earning 9%.  Seemingly, I could borrow against that as well.  This doesn't seem right as now BenQi and Yeti would both hold a claim to my original sAVAX.  For example, if I got liquidated on Yeti, then how could the collateral still exist on Benqi?

Hopefully, I am explaining this correctly.  My first thought it that staking it on Yeti would essentially remove it from my Benqi deposit and would reduce my health factor accordingly.  But if I staked it all, then it would immediately liquidate my Benqi position, but there would be nothing to liquidiate.

Any help would be appreciated.  I may try to stake a very small portion (1 or 2 AVAX) on Yeti as a trial just to see what the loopback effect is on Benqi."

"Getting AVAX on to Terra/Anchor as ""wasAVAX""",terraluna,u61vw1,2022-04-17 21:53:11,3,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/terraluna/comments/u61vw1/getting_avax_on_to_terraanchor_as_wasavax/,patriotmatrix,Terra Ecosystem,"I could not really find instructions on performing this, most instructions are for using Anchor on Avalanche, not to Terra. But, I had worked it out and I just did my first test trx of this process and it worked flawlessly. This all begins with having AVAX on the C-chain in your MetaMask and ends with you having wasAVAX on the Terra blockchain which can be deposited into Anchor.

1. Visit BenQi as noted on Anchor/Terra's Borrow page [https://staking.benqi.fi/stake](https://staking.benqi.fi/stake)
2. Stake AVAX with BenQi - you will receive sAVAX in your MM wallet (you can add sAVAX to your wallet via a link. Current rate is 7% APR)
3. Visit [https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer](https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer) which is the Wormhole bridge to Terra and connect to your MM wallet
4. Portal lays out the process in 4 steps: Source, Target, Send Tokens, Redeem Tokens
   1. Source = your sAVAX in your MM wallet on Avalanche C-chain
   2. Target = your Terra wallet address
   3. Send Tokens initiates the bridging process
   4. Redeem Tokens is the trx for depositing your now wasAVAX into your Terra wallet
5. Once the wasAVAX is in your Terra wallet it should show up for depositing into Anchor's Borrow page [https://app.anchorprotocol.com/borrow](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/borrow) as collateral to borrow UST against it

This is a basic overview of the process which I have completed on my first attempt and it went smoothly - and quickly. I'm sure there are more details which can be added so feel free to add them in the comments. Cheers!"

Okay I'm using Benqi (similar to AAVE) where I can lend AVAX, USDT, LINK... In Koinly I tag those as ""sent to pool"" correct? I am also Staking an AVAX-Qi LP on the platform, do I tag that as ""sent to pool"" as well? I assume so, cant imagine what else. Thanks."
