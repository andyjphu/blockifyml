My Surgery Experience,tummytucksurgery,1i9x2ug,2025-01-25 16:07:29,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1i9x2ug/my_surgery_experience/,USDE2015,,"
To start, I’m a 41-year-old American female living in Germany. I’m 5’1” and 128.5 pounds. I’m very athletic and work out daily. I have two teenage children, and let’s just say pregnancy wasn’t the kindest to my petite frame.

My surgery took place in Mainz, Germany on 22 January. I arrived at the surgery center at 7 a.m. and was quickly shown to my private room. After changing into a gown, net underwear, and a hair net, the nurse took me to the pre-op holding area, where I waited for my surgeon. I was a bundle of nerves, but as soon as she walked in, I felt more at ease.

As she marked me up, we started chatting about recent U.S. politics and what might happen next in Germany. It was a welcome distraction. When she finished, she wanted to take a photo, but I suddenly felt hot, and my ears started ringing—a classic sign I was about to faint. I had to lie down on the bed. It was probably just nerves, but I calmed down quickly.

The anesthesiologist’s assistant then came in to insert my IV and gave me something to help me relax. The anesthesiologist followed shortly after, introducing himself with a warm, funny demeanor. He promised to take good care of me, which put me at ease. Before I knew it, I was being wheeled into the operating room. My surgeon gave me a big double-armed wave, and the last thing I remember saying was, “Make me skinny!”

I woke up in recovery absolutely freezing and starving. As soon as I heard German voices, I instinctively started speaking in German, telling them I was cold and hungry. They wrapped me in a heated blanket and wheeled me to my private room. Along the way, one nurse said to the other, “I thought she was American?” I switched to English and explained that I was. They asked if I’d prefer German or English, and I chose English. I still laugh about waking up speaking German, especially since it’s not my native language.

My private room had a beautiful view of a cathedral. Since I’d mentioned being hungry, they brought me a tea cake, pretzels, and peppermint tea. My throat was so dry from the breathing tube that I had to sip water with each bite to avoid choking.

Shortly after, I noticed some congestion in my lungs. I was terrified to cough because I knew it would hurt, but eventually, I couldn’t hold it back any longer. The pain was indescribable—worse than broken bones or labor. I felt the blood drain from my face and almost fainted from the intensity.

Thankfully, I had no nausea from the anesthesia. I don’t know how long the surgery lasted, but I’ll ask my surgeon at my follow-up next week. When I woke up, I had one drain in place.

The nurses spoke limited English, and with my brain foggy from the meds, my German came out as a mix of English and German. Still, we made it work. The nurses were incredibly sweet—like grandmas (“Omas”) who genuinely wanted to take care of me.

During surgery, I wore compression boots to prevent blood clots, and when I woke up, I had a catheter that stayed in overnight. I also continued wearing the boots, which alternated between legs and beeped each time. They woke me up frequently and became a bit annoying.

The nurses checked on me every three hours to monitor my blood pressure, temperature, drain, and catheter. They also administered IV antibiotics and fluids to keep me hydrated.

The next morning, my surgeon came to check on me. She said she was thrilled with how everything went and complimented my results. I had a 2-inch (four-finger) diastasis recti separation, and she said my hard work at the gym was evident—I now have a six-pack! I had shown her a photo of a previous patient and said, “I want to look like this,” and while she seemed skeptical at first, she told me I now look even better than that woman.

I also had a breast lift, and thankfully, I had good tissue left to work with. Right now, my breasts look big (likely due to swelling and repositioning), and I’m thrilled with the result. I was a 32D before surgery, and my surgeon is confident I’ll maintain that size.

Let’s Talk Pain:

	•	Breast Lift: Barely any pain. It just feels like I had an intense chest day at the gym.

	•	Tummy Tuck & Muscle Repair: The first two days were rough. If the Grim Reaper had shown up on post-op day one (POD1), I probably would’ve gone with him. But by POD3, I’m feeling much better. I’m down to Tylenol and a muscle relaxer, and I may even skip the muscle relaxer tomorrow.

Medications

My doctor prescribed:
	•	Antibiotics (14 days or until the drains are removed)
	•	Tylenol 3
	•	Diazepam (a muscle relaxer)
	•	Blood thinner injections (10 days)

I also started stool softeners on day one and prune juice on day two. Let’s just say I may have overdone it with the prune juice—I had an excellent cleanse.

Biggest Challenges
	1.	Lower Back Pain: Walking hunched over and sitting in a jackknife position has been tough. My surgeon doesn’t want me to stand upright until our follow-up next week.
	2.	Exhaustion: Even small tasks, like walking to the bathroom or doing a lap around the house, leave me drained.
	3.	The Binder: I woke up in a binder instead of a faja, and it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I can’t shower or remove it until my post-op appointment, so I have no idea what I look like yet.

Overall, this was a long post, but I hope it helps someone! Honestly, the recovery hasn’t been as bad as I expected.

albion is lifeless unemotional and stale. tim smith beats the life out of the songs too much,HarpBand,1i9vn39,2025-01-25 15:04:00,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarpBand/comments/1i9vn39/albion_is_lifeless_unemotional_and_stale_tim/,Ok_Instance_1352,,"ı love Tim Smith. the courage of others is a masterpiece. ıts a modern classic. It defines my early adulthood and ı remember my high school or university years by holding onto it as a soundtrack to my memories. It is the most unique musical experience that has occurred to me and will always remain imprinted in my life since ıt changed my whole perspective on music and art.  ı also find bamnan and slivercork both brilliant and hilarious. there are so many good combinations of musical details like colorful keyboard parts, innocent and adventurous lyrics, and good humor. ı admit that ı cannot fully wrap up the van occupanther in my head. ı think it's a unique American experience and ı am not from the United States. so ıt is understandable.

tim smith is not a tormented genius. he is not a depressed creative hermit either. he beats the life out of songs. the fairest way is a damn good song, among the best of Midlake and they recorded it within days.

check out the demo of Chrystals which he uploaded ten years ago. ıt is already dreamy and ethereal. its lyrics are far more evocative. I have known free from all the ransoms/Golden leaves will blow some/Like a really low rain cloud/Hiding only the suns glow /Turn my eyes when rain come over /Leaves a fever, I know I’ll Climb on/ Live unto all but impart, Give room to rise/ Damn the earth from my eyes, go where I’m not tired. “ ın the end album version feels stale.

Moreover, the deluxe edition of The Courage of Others includes an alternative version of Fortune. Compared to the album version, it is full of wind chimes and oboes, and it feels like a refreshing druidic ritual.

although my admiration of some of his music and his character, ten years of  my anticipation and fandom ı am not digging Albion that much. ı would expect much more. ı find it meaningful but without the dynamism of Midlake musicianship, it feels unemotional and lifeless. ıt is the sound of ultimate desolation.

An 08 Honda Civic door ruined my life...,nosleep,1i9tgcw,2025-01-25 13:29:07,1,0.6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9tgcw/an_08_honda_civic_door_ruined_my_life/,MrWilsby,,"I know, I know, it’s a strange combination of words that makes me sound crazy—no, more than crazy—like a lunatic, and right now you’re probably asking yourself how that’s even possible; but I promise you that I will try, to the best of my abilities, to explain how an eighth gen Civic door that I purchased from a scrapyard nearly made a divorcee of me, almost brought my life to a premature conclusion, and gave me a severe case of PTSD which plagues me to this day...

The story starts three years ago in a bungalow on the outskirts of Minneapolis during the height of the Covid pandemic, with me and my wife going through some harsh economic times. My wife had been laid off from her job, and I was working from the house remotely. During this time we never once left the home except to walk our five-year old Toy Poodle Luna around the yard to do her business, and everything was ordered in. We needed a replacement rear passenger side door for the old summer vehicle, a red, eighth gen Honda Civic, because ours was all rusted through. Looking to save a buck, I did what any other sane person would do—I called the local wrecking yard.

“Hey,” I asked the first person to pick up, “you wouldn’t happen to have a rear passenger side door for an 08 Honda Civic on hand, would you?”

""What color are you looking for?” the salesman asked gruffly.

“Red,” I responded politely.

“Let me check here on my computer for you…” Some thirty seconds went by before he said:

“You’re in luck. A red 08 Honda Civic just came in the other week from the impact auction with that door in mint condition. We’re asking two hundred for it.”

After haggling for a bit with the salesman on the price, he informed me that there u-pick yard was closed because of Covid, and that they would have to deliver the part to my doorstep. I gave the salesman my address, and the part was speedily delivered to my doorstep the very next day, much faster than I could’ve ever anticipated. I was extremely satisfied with the condition of the part, the service, the price, and the salesman, so I made sure to leave the wrecking yard a glowing review on google. I then spent the better part of an afternoon replacing the door on the car that we had now parked for the winter in our garage. At the time, I remember the door feeling a little bit heavier than the one I uninstalled and thinking that was odd, but I chalked it up to my imagination playing tricks on me.

Now unlike most horror stories, where a foreign object is introduced into a household and strange occurrences begin happening almost immediately, it took about one month before the strange occurrences began afflicting my household.

The first strange occurrence to afflict my household happened near the beginning of January. I was reading the morning newspaper while enjoying some pancakes drenched in table syrup and drinking a cup of coffee that my wife had prepared for breakfast, while she went out to check the mail. She came back with the mail in hand, but with consternation written all over her face. I should’ve been concerned, but what you need to understand is, my wife suffers from a severe case of OCD, so I never took any of her concerns seriously. She was always finding shit to obsess and nag me about. But, on the flipside of the coin, she was smoking hot, so I thought that was a small price to pay for someone that looked like her.

“What’s the matter,” I humored her, dropping my cup of morning Joe from my lips and affecting concern with raised eyebrows.

“Oh!” replied my wife somewhat dismissively. “It’s nothing really, just that I see some footprints in the snow—”

“Footprints in the snow!” I cried. “For Christ’s sake honey, we’ve got people delivering goods to our doorstep night and day! Of course there’s gonna be some footprints in the snow—""

“NO!” she cried petulantly, this time cutting me short. “You never let me finish! These aren’t just some delivery guy’s footprints. I followed them to see where they led, and they seem to wrap around the entirety of the house, like some thief scouting our place for the easiest point of entry.”

“Tell me,” I said patronizingly, “did the footprints end at the pine tree in our back yard and some yellow snow? Maybe the delivery guy needed to take a leak and decided to use our tree for privacy.”

“Why do you always have to be such an argumentative asshole about everything? For fuck’s sake, no! no! no! The footprints *did not* lead to the pine tree and there was no piss!”

“Okay I believe you,” I lied. “It’s just, you know how I get when people bother me when I’m eating. I only have a few bites left, and when those are finished I’ll come out to investigate.”

“Sure thing,” she replied submissively. My wife, however, wouldn’t let me finish the last few bites in peace. She sat down at the table, pretended to browse the web on her phone, and started tapping her fingers and feet impatiently while waiting for me to finish, doing everything in her power to make those last few bites as miserable an experience as possible. I muttered “fuck it” under my breath to express my displeasure, mopped up the remaining table syrup on my plate with the last few remaining bites of pancake, and wolfed it down in haste.

Once outside, she began leading me to the place where she thought she saw the prints. A storm cloud was passing overhead and it was snowing pretty heavily. At last, when we wrapped around the side of our house, I asked my wife where it was that she saw the prints.

“They’re gone!” she cried in surprise. “The snow’s covered them up!”

“Perhaps they never existed to begin with,” I said with a dismissive shrug of my shoulders.

“No!” my wife cried indignantly. “That’s not true at all and you know it! Had you come outside when I first told you about them, and not waited until you finished your breakfast and for a fucking blizzard to roll through, you would’ve seen them too!”

“Ok, I believe you,” I lied in attempt to defuse the situation. “But what do you want me to do about it? Call the police over some footprints in the snow? They’ll think I’m crazy!”

“I just want you to be on your guard is all and keep your eyes open from this day forth…”

There the conversation ended, and we went back inside; but this was just the first strange occurrence in a series of many more to come. That night I retired to bed, and must have been sleeping for a couple of hours, when my wife grabbed me by the shoulder and shrieked in my ear in mortal terror:

“Honey wake up! Wake up!”

“Jesus Christ!” I grumbled, opening one eye and glaring at her reproachfully. If there’s one thing I hate, more than being disturbed while eating a good meal, it’s being woken up prematurely from a good sleep. “What fucking time is it?”

“The time doesn’t matter! There’s a man clad in black standing just outside our garage and surveying the house! I think we should call the police!”

“Now let’s not do anything rash,” I said, slipping on my slippers. My wife grabbed me by the wrist and lead me towards the window. She was too terrified to look out the window again herself, and instead cowered behind the wall while looking at me expectantly, waiting to see my reaction.

“SEE? SEE?” she whispered while I scanned the entire front yard.

“Honey,” I said, my voice thick with concern. “There’s not a soul in sight…”

“Not a soul in sight?” she said in disbelief, finally mustering up the courage to look out the window again. “Why, there was a man standing there less than half a minute ago, staring right at me! Oh! you have to believe me!”

“It’s not that I don’t want to believe you, it’s that I can’t. There’s simply no one there. Honey, I’m worried about you… you’re sleep deprived and just need a good night’s rest is all,” I said, solicitously wrapping my arms around her and leading her back to bed.

The next night after that one, my sleep was interrupted not by my wife this time, but our dog Luna. My wife and I rushed out from our bedroom half-clad, and found her in the living room barking maniacally from our living room in the direction of the garage. My wife saw this as some sort of confirmation that her suspicions were correct, turned to me and cried:

“See? See? I’m not going crazy! Even Luna sees something!”

“Dogs bark at anything and everything,” I said dismissively, although my hair was standing on end and goosebumps had formed on my flesh. “It wouldn’t be the first time she’s woken us up in the middle of the night. It’s probably the winter wind that’s upsetting her. Come on, let’s go back to bed.”

The next morning I came out of the washroom feeling as buoyant as a cork after having taken my morning deuce, when I was ambushed in the hallway by my wife who was a much earlier riser than me.

“It’s January 12,” my wife said, “do you know what that means?”

“No,” I grumbled, “but I’m sure you’re going to tell me.”

“It means that our Christmas lights and tree have been up for way too long! All of our neighbors have already taken theirs down, and we’re the only ones with them still up!”

“Get off my ass!” I complained. “You know I had every intention of taking them down the other day, I was just busy with work. I’ll get to work on it this afternoon.”

When the afternoon came, I grabbed the ladder from the garage while muttering profanities under my breath, and got to work on taking down the lights. About halfway through my task, my neighbor, whom I will call George for the sake of confidentiality, pulled into his laneway for his lunchbreak, and got out of his Ford Escape. In neighborly fashion I waved at him, before asking him how everything on his side of the fence was going. I entertained his idle and pointless chatter about for about five minutes, before steering the conversation in the direction I wanted.

“Say George,” I began, “you haven’t seen anything…suspicious happening along our street as of late?”

“Suspicious?” asked George. “I guess it all depends on your definition of suspicious...”

“I don’t know, like people going up and down this road and into my yard that don’t belong here?”

“Hmm…” he mused thoughtfully, “no, I can’t say I have. The only thing I’ve seen is a bunch of delivery guys coming in and out of your driveway and that’s it. Why is everything alright? Should I be concerned?”

“Ah!” I said with a dismissive wave of my hand. “It’s nothing. Just my wife swears she’s been seeing a man trespassing on our property. Anyways, enjoy the rest of your day George!”

“You too, buddy. I’ll be sure to keep on eye open for you guys and let y’all know if I see anything out of place.

“And say, when this whole pandemic thing is over you need to come over for a barbeque and some beers like the good ole days.”

“Sure thing. I’d do just about anything to get away from my wife! I think I’m finally starting to get cabin fever after having been locked up with her for so long!”

“Ha! ha! I hear you on that! My wife has been driving me up the wall too!”

George and I shared a nice hearty laugh, and I went back inside after having taken down the last of the Christmas lights. The only thing remaining was the Christmas tree, which I threw at the end of our laneway for the Christmas tree collection.

The next morning, I sat down at the dinner table to eat some French toast and drink my freshly steaming cup of morning Joe, that my wife had just prepared for me.

“Huh,” I said, in between a sip of my coffee while reading the morning newspaper. “There’s been a lot of murders happening not far from here these past couple weeks. A home invasion in Brooklyn Park where a husband and wife were murdered in cold blood; and a man, driving a vehicle just like ours, was murdered in cold blood on a rural road outside of Bloomington… Even stranger, the cops think that these two seemingly disparate murders are related and committed by the same guy and that more might follow. Pretty crazy stuff, isn’t it?”

My wife, however, only feigned the slightest of interest and shrugged her shoulders despondently. I put the newspaper down, looked her in the eyes and said:

“Ok, I can sense something’s eating you alive. Get it off your chest, will you?”

“You,” my wife began, “said that the part you ordered came from a vehicle that came from an impact auction, didn’t you? My theory is that someone died in the vehicle the door came from, and their spirit attached itself to the door we now have, and the spirit will forever be unwilling to leave us alone until we return it back to the wrecking yard it came from.”

“What makes you so convinced that the door is possessed?” I laughed.

“The footsteps, the appearance of the man, Luna barking throughout the night, everything that I’ve seen, seems to be concentrated around the garage, where the door you just brought into this house is.”

“Let’s say that you’re right,” I humored her, “and that the door is demonically possessed as you so eloquently put it… Why would the spirit wait one month after arriving at our house before making its presence known?”

“I don’t know the specifics,” she cried irritably, raising her voice, “and I’m not an expert on paranormal activity! All I know is, our life won’t return to normal until we get rid of that door for good!”

I knew that my wife would forever be unwilling to relent on the issue. She would nag and nag and nag until I finally conceded defeat and agreed to take the door back to where it came from. Only, I was unwilling to concede defeat on something so stupid, and little did she know that I was holding an ace up my sleeve that I was hoping would end discussion on this matter forever.

“Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? This isn’t the fucking *Conjuring*! Life isn’t a movie! Ghosts don’t exist! And if they did, they sure as shit don’t attach themselves to inanimate objects despite what Hollywood wants you to believe!

“And besides, I talked with George the other day to see if he’s seen anything suspicious happening in the neighborhood as of late, and you know what he had to say?”

“What?”

“That he hasn’t seen a fucking thing! It’s all a figment of your imagination, honey, and I’m really worried about you…”

“George is a stupid, sodden drunk with a below room-temp IQ!” my wife cried. “What-in-the-actual fuck! would he know about anything?”

“Don’t you talk about George like that!” I defended angrily. “He’s a kind-hearted family man! You take that back!”

“Fuck George and fuck you too! You’re a misogynistic pig, and I regret having gave you the last five years of my life!”

She then stormed out of the kitchen, giving me the much-desired solitude I needed to enjoy my French Toast and cup of morning Joe.

The next morning, as I was eating a plate of bacon and eggs that my wife prepared for me, sunny side up just the way I like them, I heard a van pulling up to our house. I then heard a thud at the front door, and heard the same vehicle driving off. My wife opened the door, picked up a package and came back inside with a smug look on her face.

“What’s that?” I asked through a mouthful of food, and taking a swig of morning Joe to wash it down quickly. “I don’t remember having ordered anything from Amazon.”

“This,” said my wife, ripping open the package and tearing out its contents. “Is ghost-hunting equipment, and I’m going to use it to prove a point.”

“Ghost-hunting equipment!” I laughed. “You’ve lost your mind! How much did that cost? Ten bucks?”

“One-hundred dollars—”

“One-hundred dollars!” I cried, spitting out a half-masticated bite of bacon and eggs I was thoroughly enjoying, my laughter giving way to rage. “We’re up to our eyeballs in debt, and you thought it would be a good idea to piss away one-hundred dollars on fucking ghost-hunting equipment? My god! I’m trying my best not to lose my cool, but you are making that extremely difficult on me right now. You need to repackage that shit right now and get a return on it while there’s still time!”

“Just hear me out!” my wife pleaded.

“Just this one last time; but I warn you, you’re walking a very thin line…”

“Okay,” my wife said, taking a deep breath before giving me an ultimatum. “Just let me set up this device, and use it on the door. If it comes back with a positive signature, you agree to send the door back to the scrapyard. If, on the other hand, it somehow comes back with nothing, I promise not to say another word about the door ever again, come what may, and I’ll get to work on sending the device back immediately.”

Seeing as I was wholeheartedly convinced that the door was not demonically possessed and that I was in the right, I readily agreed to the proposal. Five minutes later found us in the garage, gathered around the door in anticipation. My wife, with trembling hands, raised the ghost-detector and pressed the on switch—and alas! the signal we were met with was a negative one. My wife was evidently deflated and defeated, but I of course felt nothing but jubilation.

“See?” I gloated in triumph. “It’s nothing more than a figment of your imagination! Now get to work on repacking that stupid thing and sending it back so we can recoup our money while there’s still time.”

Without a word, and with head downcast, my wife returned to the living room and got to work on repackaging the detector…

I thought my wife would be a woman of her word and never bring the topic up again, but boy was I ever wrong. Our life returned to normal for nothing more than the span of eight hours, before she reopened the discussion on the door over dinner that she prepared.

“I just can’t shake the feeling that we’re being watched—” she said, her eyes wet with tears, showing the first signs of a nervous breakdown.

“For Christ’s sake!” I cried, slamming my fork and knife down on the dinner plate. “I thought we were off of this topic!”

“Just hear me out!” my wife pleaded. “Maybe the door isn’t demonically possessed like I initially thought, but that doesn’t mean that someone, a real person, might not be after the door.”

“Do you hear how crazy you sound right now? What could anyone want with an old Civic door? It’s a fucking door!”

“You said the wrecking yard got the vehicle from an impact auction, didn’t you? Maybe the owner of the vehicle had some sort of sentimental attachment to the door, and won’t stop until they get the door back—""

“Sentimental attachment to a door?” I cried in disbelief, cutting her short. “That might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard! We’ve already been over this! I talked to George and not a soul has seen anything suspicious happening on this road other than you. No more, I’m done. You’ve lost your mind. I refuse to talk to you about this ever again.”—I stormed off, leaving the rest of my dinner untouched.

That night my wife and I went to sleep on opposite sides of the bed, and when I woke the next morning it was without the familiar scent of breakfast and coffee assailing my nostrils. I found my wife at the front door, fully dressed with her winter boots on and with Luna standing at her side.

“You taking the dog outside to do her business?” I asked while yawning and scratching my head. “And say, where’s breakfast at?”

“I’m done,” my wife sniffled laconically while zipping-up her coat and turning her back to me.

“What do you mean you’re done?” I asked innocently, but narrowing my eyes suspiciously. “Done with staying put in the house?”

“I’m done with *us* you fucking halfwit!” she snapped while sobbing and turning back around to face me. “ I can’t do this anymore! Until you admit that there’s a serious problem facing this household, and that there’s something or someone stalking the house, I’m done with *us* and never coming back. I’ve booked myself a room in a hotel for the next week. You have precisely seven days to sort this shit out, at the end of which time I’ll be seeing a divorce lawyer. Goodbye.”

“You know,” I spat, seething with anger, “that’s just fucking like you! Threatening me with divorce over another one of your goddamn hallucinations! And now you’re wasting money we don’t have on a hotel room? My god! Whatever, I’m past the point of caring; walk you fucking headcase! But you ain’t taking Luna with you, I’ll tell you that right fucking now. Luna! Come here girl!”

Luna was just about to run over to me when my wife scooped her up in her arms and darted out of the house. I chased the two out of the door, following hot on their heels, but my wife had too much of a jump on me and had already prepared her escape. She had the Chevy Equinox already warmed up and the snow scraped off the front and back windshields. She jumped in the vehicle and quickly locked the doors behind her.

“Give her back!” I screamed like a maniac, running alongside the vehicle and slapping viciously on window while she sped off. “You fucking bitch! Give her back now!”

But it was no use. She reached the road and sped off, while some of the neighbors came out to watch me freaking out in my morning robe and slippers like an idiot. Embarrassed, I hastened back inside as quick as I could and slammed the door behind me. I went to the fridge, threw the door open angrily, grabbed some beer, threw on the tv and then put in an order for extra large meat lover’s pizza, just the way I like it, that was to arrive within an hour. About eight beers deep, the pizza had not come, and I couldn’t resist the urge to doze off…

I was woken up by the sound of my phone ringing and vibrating like a motherfucker. It was now dark outside, and the tv I was watching had turned off automatically. “Just how long was I out for?” I pondered. I managed to pick up my phone a second before it went to voicemail, and to my great displeasure, it was my wife’s Karen-like voice on the other end.

“Honey!” she screamed in a panic. “You need to get out of the house, now!”

“Why?” I drawled drunkenly, rising to my feet and looking over my shoulders in a panic. “Is the house burning down or something?”

“No! the house isn’t burning down but your life is in grave danger! I’m on my way back as we speak, but you need to get out of the house, now, before it’s too late! There’s something inside of the door, something that someone’s after. It’s the reason why the man in Bloomington and the couple in Brooklyn Park were murdered and your life is in jeopardy—""

There was a knock on the door.

A couple seconds later the doorbell wrung.

“Hang on,” I interrupted, “there’s someone knocking on the door… It’s probably the pizza guy; I’ll call you back in a moment—”

“DON’T ANSWER IT!” she tried warning me. “WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T ANSWER THAT DOOR—” but I hung up. What can I say? I was wasted beyond belief and had no idea how much danger I was in, despite my wife’s warnings. Without so much as a second thought, I drunkenly stumbled to the door and threw it wide open, only to see nothing but empty space before me, no car in the laneway, just the pizza that I had ordered hours before with the receipt stapled to the box and that had unceremoniously been thrown on the ground.

“How strange!” I drawled drunkenly. “The pizzaman didn’t even wait for me to tip him before taking off. My god! am I ever hungry…” I stooped down to pick up my pizza and the next thing I knew a blunt instrument was crashing down on the top of my skull. Everything faded to black…

When I woke, I was conscious of the fact that my hands and feet were bound, that I was seated on a wooden chair, and that there was a sock stuffed in my mouth. Everything was a red haze because of the blood running in a current down my face from where I was struck and pooling in my eyes. A man within arm’s reach, clad all in black and wearing a face mask, was working on putting the trim panel of the rear passenger-side Civic door back in place. I shut my eyes and reopened them. No, this wasn’t a dream; there really was a man putting the trim panel on the door back into place. Naturally and automatically, I began struggling against my bindings. When he became aware that I had regained consciousness, he looked back at me and said:

“Ah! you’re awake! I’m so glad you can finally join me! If you promise not to scream like a woman and wake up the whole neighborhood, I’ll be so kind as to remove that sock from your mouth; can you do that for me?”

I nodded my assent, wide-eyed with terror, and the man removed the sock from my mouth. The first words that escaped my trembling lips were:

“What—ah! my fucking head is splitting—the hell is going on here!”

The villain went on to humor my request and explain everything.

“What’s going on,” he began, while going about his task at the same time, “is you happened to be in possession of something of mine; something extremely valuable. Here, take a look at this—” he threw a bundle in my lap that must have weighed at least 10 pounds.

“What am I looking at?”

“What you’re looking at is a bundle of fentanyl pills worth around one-quarter of a million dollars, and that was hidden inside of the door you purchased from the wrecking yard. While you spent the last five minutes regaining your consciousness after I pistol whipped you, I spent that time dismantling the door you purchased to recover my product.

“I get it, I get it, you’re confused, and rightfully so; I would be too if I was in your shoes. But here, let me explain:

“Back in November of last year, I was running some fentanyl that I manufactured from America into Canada, when the Honda I was driving, the same model and color as yours, hit a patch of black ice before I even made it to the border. I veered off the road going around eighty miles per hour, and went head on with a tree. The accident fucked me up bad, and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the ICU two weeks later, not knowing what the hell had happened. Fortunately, my wife was by my bedside to fill in the gap in my memory.

“The first thing I needed to do was track the movement of my vehicle. I asked my wife in a panic what happened to our vehicle, and she, who I keep in the dark about my line of work—the innocent soul still thinks I make my fortune through crypto—informed me that the vehicle was fucked up beyond repair, that she was left with no other choice but to write it off, and that it ended up in an impact auction. The first thing I did after recovering from my injuries was to call the impact auction and ask them what happened to my vehicle. They were kind enough to inform me the exact wrecking yard that it had been sold to. Simple enough, I foolishly thought. All that needs to be done is to purchase all four doors from the wrecking yard, and I would once more be in possession of the million dollars’ worth of product I had lost. If only things had been that simple…

“I drove to the wrecking yard only to discover, to my horror, that all four doors had been sold to who-the-fuck knows where, and that’s when the panic began to set in. Before leaving, I asked the sales-desk if they knew where those doors went. They gave me a strange look for asking such a weirdly pointed question, said that they had no clue and that even if they did, they were legally obligated to protect customer information.

“I had no choice but to break into their office later that night after closing, and access that information myself on their computers. After some digging, I was able to find the addresses I was looking for easily enough, and went on my way.

“Fortunately, unlike you, the front driver’s side door I was after, was on a Civic that was a couple’s daily driver, and they left their vehicle parked in their laneway; meaning, I could go about my work during the night with everyone being none the wiser—or so I thought.

“I’m sure you heard about the double homicide home invasion that happened two weeks ago in Brooklyn Park? Yeah, that was me. What was supposed to be a simple in-and-out job, quickly became an unmitigated disaster. I broke into the vehicle without tripping the alarm, and just as I finished retrieving my product and putting the trim panel back on the door and popping the window switch into place, the porch light turned on. The next thing I knew I found myself involved in a shootout. I managed to emerge victorious, only taking a grazing bullet to my shoulder while shooting my opponent in the head. I then went into the house to stage the whole thing to look like a home invasion. I killed his wife in cold blood, ruffled some things around in haste, made off with my product, and the police never suspected a thing.

“The front passenger’s side door that I was after was in Bloomington, and this time it belonged to a single man in his early thirties, and fortunately his Civic was his daily driver as well. I was unwilling to make the same mistake I made last time in attempting to get the goods out in the open in someone’s laneway, so this time I stalked this man’s daily movements. I tailed him going down a deserted stretch of rural road on his one-hour commute to a construction site outside of the city, and fender-bendered him. I got him to pull over under the pretense of exchanging insurance information. That’s when I popped him in the head and made off with my second parcel of goods.

“Now only two more bundles remained, and one of them you were in unwitting possession of. I rented an Air B&B not far from here and spent the last week casing your place out. When I discovered that your vehicle was parked for the winter, I realized I had a real problem on my hands. I then waited and waited and waited for the right moment to go in and pluck the goods when you and your wife were away from the house. The goal was to go about this as discreetly and with as little bloodshed as possible, but unfortunately you two made that an impossible task for me. All I needed was a fifteen-minute window to break into your house and do what needed doing, but alas! the window of opportunity never came. You and your wife refused to leave the house for an entire week, and that dog of yours, that Cerberus, kept giving away my movements every time I tried forcing an entry during the night. I only have so much patience and a life I need to return to, and you two left me with no other choice than to go about this the direct way.

“When I saw your wife storming off from the house in a huff with your dog and her bags packed earlier today, I was able to deduce that you two had a falling out and all I had to contend with was you and that my moment arrived at last. I waited until it got dark, and then pounced on my opportunity.

“Well, that brings us up to the present,” he said, popping the window switch back into place, packing his tools up, and pocketing the parcel of drugs, “and that concludes my work here. Ha! I’ve become more proficient in the art of removing trim panels than I ever thought I would need to be! After tonight, I have only one more package to reclaim and then I can finally put this disaster to bed, although that one happens to be in another state entirely…”

“So that’s why the door felt so heavy when I was putting it on,” I said, shaking my head in disbelief. “But why not just show up at my door and make me an offer for the door I couldn’t refuse? I would’ve been willing to give you the door for anything you were willing to offer!”

“I thought about doing just that,” the villain said, nodding his head in agreement, “when I saw that you and your wife wouldn’t budge from the house, but I couldn’t take the risk. On paper you might say that you would’ve been willing to take whatever I offered for it, and then there was always the chance that you would get curious, tell me to go fuck myself, and check what was inside of the door yourself. Then you might’ve called the cops, who would’ve traced the door back to the wrecking yard and back to me, and I would be looking at blowing out my birthday candles in a cell for the rest of my life. No, as I said before, this was something that needed to be done as discreetly as possibly, with no one none the wiser.

“But, as I’ve already said, my work here is concluded, and I’ve told you too much. I’ll have to stage this to look like nothing more than a regular-old home invasion. You better start saying your Hail Marys...”

The villain reached into his coat jacket, produced a silenced pistol and pointed it at my forehead.

I closed my eyes in fear and fought ferociously against my bonds while whimpering like a baby:

“NO, PLEASE! You don’t have to do this! I won’t tell a soul about what happened here tonight! I promise!”

“Ha! ha! look at the piss running down your leg!” he laughed hysterically (just for the record, and sorry for barging in here and ruining the pacing of the story at such a climactic moment, I never pissed myself; he just made that up to humiliate me further and to indulge his twisted sense of humor, and I left what he said in the story for the sake of transparency…) “It never ceases to amaze me just how much you sheep fear the grim reaper and cling onto life! I promise you, death isn’t so terrifying when you think about it; nothing more than everlasting sleep is all. Goodbye friend—”

At this point I heard a gunshot, my head retreated into my chest like a tortoise’s head retreating into its shell, and my ears were ringing like a bitch. I was fully convinced that I had just been shot and that my time here on earth had been cut short. I refused to open my eyes and thought to myself *so this really is what death feels like...eternal darkness, just like the villain said.* But just as the thought passed through my head, I heard something metallic clatter on the ground, and felt the rope binding my hands behind my back being frantically sawed through.

I opened my eyes, surveyed the scene in front of me, and immediately understood what had happened. The villain was lying in a puddle of his own blood on the garage floor, and his brains were splattered all over the wall to my right. The thing that I heard clatter on the pavement was the handgun my wife always carried on her person, and the one she must've just used to save my life. My wife finished sawing the ropes that bound my hands, and began working on the ones that bound my feet.

“Are you okay?” my wife looked up at me solicitously while hugging my leg (would she have been hugging my leg if I had pissed myself like the villain said? No? that’s what I thought), with tears running down her cheeks. “Are you okay?”—she repeated.

“You came back for me!” I cried in disbelief. “How? And why?”

“When I stormed off today, I booked a room at the nearest dog-friendly hotel fifteen minutes away. I spent the day sobbing, eating ice cream and binge-watching Sherlock Holmes, the one we usually watch together, to try and console myself. Around an hour before I called you, an episode called “the Six Thatchers” came on.

“The episode is an interesting one, where a criminal smashes busts of Margaret Thatcher trying to find a memory stick he hid inside of one many years before. While watching the episode, I saw a number of things that paralleled our situation and it was then when I was finally able to put two and two together.

“I remembered the conversation we had at the dinner table, the one about the man dying outside of Bloomington, and how he happened to drive a vehicle like ours, and the couple who were murdered in Brooklyn Park, and how the police thought the murders were related, and that’s when the light bulb went off over my head.

“‘Holy shit!’ I cried, ‘Maybe, just maybe, the problem wasn’t with the door like I originally thought, but what’s inside of the door! My god I have to call him right now!’

“I reached for my phone and called you without a moment’s hesitation. My first call went to voicemail, so I hung up and tried and again, beginning to fear the worst. This time you picked up a second before the phone was going to send me to voicemail, and that’s when I tried warning you.

“You, however, being the stubborn fool that you are, hung up on me while telling me that someone was knocking on the door, and I knew that something was seriously wrong. I called the police, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to send help for at least another hour. That’s when I sped off from the hotel, breaking every traffic law on my way over to save your life.

“The criminal left the front door unlocked, so I was able to sneak into the house undetected. As I crept to the garage, all my nerves were on edge and my hands were shaking as I gripped the handgun I always carry in my purse. Oh, honey! when I saw you bound there with a gun pressed to your forehead, I was so terrified, but I knew what had to be done. I didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger.

“And what do you mean by ‘why’? Despite everything that happened this past week, I still love you, and that’s reason enough. Everything’s going to be okay. The police will be here any minute now.”

“You were right about everything!” I sobbed pathetically, finally coming to the realization that I had the most selfless, solicitous, intelligent, and loving wife on the planet. “I don’t deserve you at all…”"

What should I do about living with my creepy stepfather?,Advice,1i9qc4e,2025-01-25 11:13:52,3,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9qc4e/what_should_i_do_about_living_with_my_creepy/,Normal_Letterhead594,,"Background info:

I used to live in France but I moved to America at the age of twelve to be with my mom. She moved to America because she fell in love with my stepdad. I'm fifteen years old and female. My mom is 45 and my stepdad,who we'll  call Patrick, is 52 years old. I've known my stepdad since I was eight and never thought he was creepy before. I now live with just my stepdad and mom.All of my friends love him and always want to talk to him when they come over.
My stepdad puts on a mask of wholesomeness and charms everyone with his overly friendly demeanor. I used to see him as a really friendly, empathetic, funny man and was quick to grow close to him. 
I eventually noticed that he was very horny, but I didn't really care because it wasn't my problem yet. Anytime you glance at his phone he'll be looking at some porn website and as soon as my mom enters the room he'll slam his phone onto the table. I know the look he has when he's having inappropriate thoughts, his gaze and whole demeanor change. Once I walked in on him jerking off I'm his office to some image on his computer. I quickly walked away and didn't say anything.

When I was still comfortable with him, I would sit in pajamas next to him on the couch and watch movies. I usually wore red long sleeve pajama sets or my sweats and oversized Winnie the Pooh shirt combo. Nothing about my outfit was ""asking for it"" and my hair looked like a rat's nest. I really didn't expect to be sexualized.

But sadly as we watched TV, he just got so touchy… He would put a hand on my knee and as the movie went on it progressively ended wrapped around my thigh and just kept moving around between my legs. He would put his hand on my shoulder and somehow end up around my boob, I could tell he was nervous, he had it lightly on there as if he was scared I would say something if his hold was any less lighter. Which is stupid because he had already crossed the line by placing his hand there. He also would tell me to lay on his lap while we watched the movie and then progress his hand until it was laying on my butt. The worst case for me was when he unashamely slipped his hand inside my pajama pants and just had it there, holding my hip and feeling my underwear. When I moved his hand away, or jumped off the couch “to get snacks”, he would do a weird little whine of disappointment. Each time, he just said “Oh…”, or a disappointed “come on, don’t move.” or ""Where you going? You can't leave."". Whenever I sat further on the couch, he would ask me to come closer. There are two smaller couches on the side on which I would sit to avoid his touch and he would just whine the whole time about me not being with him. I felt pretty uncomfortable but gave him a pass most of the time, I just thought I was overthinking it and that he was just doing it out of affection and not lust.

One day I walked over to his office to tell him to come eat dinner and he was looking at a folder on his giant computer screen with many pictures from different days focusing on my chest or my legs that he had taken while we were seated on the couch. I felt creeped out, didn't say anything and walked out the room. He came over to me and came up with the excuse that he just kept taking accidental pictures and had put these in a folder to delete them. I believed him at the time but I don't think that makes any sense because why not just delete them when they're selected instead of putting them in a folder? And how are all the  accidental  photos you have just centered around my chest? Either way I still thought of him highly but still thought about that event often. A few months passed since that day and I'm sitting next to him on the couch, watching xo kitty. I noticed him taking a picture of me, his phone was right in front of my chest. Nohing about the way he took this picture looked accidental. He goes to the bathroom and leaves his phone on the couch. I know his password, so I open it. I quickly went to his gallery and immediately found a picture that had been taken a few minutes before, zooming into my chest. 🫤 I deleted it and scrolled down to delete one from the day before. I wish I had had the time to delete the other ones but I didn't have time to do it before he came back. 

This was the day before a trip to France and during the trip my mind just started analyzing everything about the way he acted. When researching grooming I felt like it perfectly fit into what was happening to me. I kept comparing him to my dad who is such a green flag in comparison. When I returned I felt bad for thinking of Patrick that way, especially since he had just bought me a nice pair of headphones. 
My friend Ana came over to my house the first day of school and immediately wanted to update Patrick on our school's drama. We were both wearing our school uniforms, I wore leggings under my skirt but I was just wearig my undershirt instead of my polo which is a tight fitting long sleeve. She sat on a chair while we had a lighthearted conversation with him. I started feeling weirded out by him again when he defended our teacher who had gotten fired for telling a student that he couldn't focus on his work because he was distracted by her skirt. Though he felt the need to specify that he would just think she's hot without saying it out loud, and gave me a strange look as he said that. ""Umm... That was a thirteen year old... That really doesn't bother you Patrick?""

The next day, he called me pretty while staring at me with that classic horny look and I felt so annoyed that I was supposed to thank him for that. I just said ""thanks"" 😐 and then he did a whole speech on how much I didn't care and how dry and ungrateful I was being.

Yesterday, we were watching wicked and he asked me to call my mom while he went to the bathroom. I called her but at the same time I went to his gallery to see if he had any pictures. I audibly muttered a ""What the f@ck""  when I saw that he had taken fifty pictures of my chest while I was innocently trying to make conversation with him. Then that's when I saw it... He had taken about 10 pictures of my friend's legs and even one up her skirt. These pictures might not have been a big deal on someone else's phone but I KNOW HIM, he's so dirty minded. I know he did this out of horniness. I was so creeped out and couldn't believe we hadn't noticed him doing this. I felt so much anger for my poor friend who had fallen victim of my stepfather's lust. I felt so disgusted. I wish I had had more time, maybe sent myself a screenshot for evidence or try to delete everything. But he was so quick to come back into the room. I was about to cry when he told me to come closer on the couch. 🥲 I was so relieved when my mom came home and I quickly made her sit in between us.

I genuinely don't know what to do? I feel like if I told any adult my mom's marriage could get ruined and I don't wanna cause that. I watched them cuddle on the couch and I just couldn't dare to ruin them. Then again he would be the one who really ruined things, it wouldn't be my fault. So please please give me advice. Should I tell my friends? I don't want them to feel scared of creeped out. It would be selfish of me to keep this from them. I need them (especially Ana who comes over the most and has so much love for Patrick) to be able to keep their guard and be careful around him so he doesn't end up jerking off to pictures of them.
Should I tell my mom about it? Let her know my concerns and what has been going on and ask her to get him to delete the pictures? I know she would believe me and feel protective of me.
Should I just confront Patrick? Keep this between us but let him know that I know what he's doing and make him delete it.
I'm really tempted to go back to France even though I wanted to finish high school here. I just hate having to live with this man.

Update: I showed my mom his gallery and she said his phone always accidentally takes photos and that it was definitely an accident. Idk if I believe that but after insisting for a bit and her not budging I just gave up. There's not much else I can do other than avoid him until I move back to France at the end of the school year. Thank you for the advice."
"I finished this year's re-watch. For RFB 1&2, I started asking GROK questions about the show. I was surprised to see its responses.",cowboybebop,1i9pvfo,2025-01-25 10:53:40,0,0.24,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/1i9pvfo/i_finished_this_years_rewatch_for_rfb_12_i/,joedapper,DISCUSSION,"What is your favorite episode?  
Choosing a favorite episode from ""Cowboy Bebop"" is tricky since the series delivers such a rich tapestry of storytelling, but if I had to pick one, I'd go with ""The Real Folk Blues Part 1"" (Episode 25):  


* Narrative: This episode serves as the beginning of the two-part finale. It brings together all the character arcs in a way that's both dramatic and emotionally resonant. It ties back to Spike's past with the Red Dragon crime syndicate, specifically his confrontation with Vicious, and it sets the stage for the series' conclusion.
* Character Development: We see deep into the characters' psyches, especially Spike's, as he grapples with his past, his love for Julia, and his existential crisis. The episode effectively brings out the themes of destiny, freedom, and the inescapable nature of one's past.
* Emotional Impact: The interactions, particularly between Spike and Jet, are poignant. The moment where Spike asks Jet to tell him that he'll see him later if he doesn't return, encapsulates the bond and the loneliness of their lives.
* Music: Yoko Kanno's score here is particularly moving, enhancing the mood and the stakes of the narrative, with tracks like ""See You Space Cowboy..."" adding to the melancholy yet hopeful atmosphere.
* Visual Style: The animation is top-notch, with the action scenes in this episode being memorable, and the art direction capturing the essence of both the Bebop's crew and the world they inhabit.

This episode encapsulates what ""Cowboy Bebop"" is about: a blend of action, deep character exploration, and an understanding of the human condition, all wrapped up in a visually and audibly stunning package. It's not just a favorite for the action or plot but for the emotional and thematic richness it brings to the series' end.

What is your favorite piece of music from the show?  
Picking a favorite piece of music from ""Cowboy Bebop"" is like choosing a favorite star in the sky, but if I have to, I'd go with ""Tank!"":  


* Opening Theme: ""Tank!"" serves as the opening theme for the series, and it's iconic for setting the mood right from the start. Composed by Yoko Kanno, with the Seatbelts, this track blends jazz with a unique, almost chaotic energy that captures the essence of the show's adventurous and unpredictable nature.
* Musical Composition: The song starts with a catchy bass line, followed by horns that give it a classic jazz feel, then it's punctuated by guitars and drums, creating a dynamic soundscape that's both cool and thrilling. The saxophone solos add a layer of soulfulness, perfectly complementing the series' mix of action and introspection.
* Cultural Impact: ""Tank!"" has become synonymous with ""Cowboy Bebop"" itself. It's not just background music; it's part of the show's identity. Its influence can be seen in how fans associate the tune with the adventures of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein, making it an anthem for the series.
* Versatility: What's remarkable about ""Tank!"" is how well it fits every episode, whether it's the light-hearted, comedic moments or the intense, action-packed scenes. It encapsulates the show's ability to blend genres and moods effortlessly.

While ""Tank!"" stands out, the beauty of ""Cowboy Bebop's"" music is in its diversity, from the melancholic ""Waltz for Zizi"" to the emotional depth of ""See You Space Cowboy..."", or the playful ""Doggy Dog World"" for Ein. Each piece contributes to the narrative and emotional layers of the series, but ""Tank!"" has that special something that resonates universally with fans.

I then told GROK - Spike isnt going, to die. Hes going to see if hes truly alive.  
  
That's a poignant interpretation, Joe. Spike's journey in ""The Real Folk Blues"" indeed transcends the question of death; it's an exploration of whether he can truly live, free from his past. Whether he finds that life or not, he's chasing that sense of being ""alive"" one last time. Enjoy the ride, and see where Spike's quest for life leads.

I then asked GROK if it understands carrying the weight:

In the context of Cowboy Bebop, particularly with the episode ""The Real Folk Blues"" (RFB) Part 1, the concept of ""carrying the weight that the fanhood places upon itself"" can be understood through several layers:  


1. Narrative Weight: Cowboy Bebop is often celebrated for its storytelling, character development, and thematic depth. Fans carry the weight of expectations for each episode, especially towards the end of the series like in RFB, where the culmination of character arcs and plot resolutions is anticipated. This weight is the expectation to see a satisfying conclusion that honors the journey of characters like Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, and Ein, while also maintaining the show's unique blend of genres and moods.
2. Character Legacy: Spike Spiegel, in particular, carries a significant narrative and emotional weight due to his past with the Red Dragon Syndicate and his unresolved issues with Vicious. Fans project their hopes and interpretations onto Spike, expecting his actions and decisions to reflect the complexity of his character. This fan expectation can be seen as a burden, where each move he makes is scrutinized for alignment with his character development over the series.
3. Cultural Impact: Cowboy Bebop has left a significant mark on anime culture, influencing countless works in and outside Japan. The fanhood carries the weight of this legacy, often feeling responsible for preserving the show's reputation while also advocating for its continued relevance. This involves debates over interpretations, fan theories, and even the handling of adaptations like the live-action Netflix series, where fans felt a protective duty towards the original material.
4. Emotional Investment: Fans invest emotionally in the narrative and characters, leading to a shared sense of loss, joy, or disappointment. This emotional weight is what fans feel when they discuss, critique, or celebrate the series, especially poignant in episodes like RFB where character fates are decided.

GROK asked me - How do you see it influencing your experience with the series, especially with such pivotal episodes?

I do feel the weight. The show has had more of an impact on me than any other work of art. RFB1 is a masterpiece of animated action and possibly Fayes finest moment as she demonstrates her ability to take out syndicate gangsters by herself. Then, it turns out shes being played by Julia. Heavy.   
  
GROK: It sounds like Cowboy Bebop has indeed left a profound mark on you, which is a testament to its storytelling and character depth. The episode ""The Real Folk Blues"" Part 1 is indeed a crescendo of narrative and emotional weight, particularly with Faye's character arc. Her moment of demonstrating her capabilities against the Syndicate is not just a showcase of her skills but also a critical point in her character development, illustrating her independence and resilience.  
However, the twist with Julia adds layers of complexity and betrayal, turning Faye's moment of triumph into one tinged with manipulation and the harsh realities of the world they inhabit. This duality in Faye's experience, from empowerment to realization, encapsulates the bittersweet essence of Cowboy Bebop - where victories are often pyrrhic, and every character carries their own burden of past and present.  
The emotional weight you feel as a fan is part of what makes Cowboy Bebop such an enduring piece of art. It evokes a spectrum of feelings, from exhilaration to melancholy, reflecting the multifaceted nature of life itself. This connection you have with the series, feeling the weight of its narrative and character journeys, is what keeps the show alive in the hearts of its fans, long after the credits roll.

"[M4A] (A Playing as multiple F) (Always Open) Huge Idea Drop: Harem-Themed Anime & Fandom RP Prompts Packed with Story, Action, and Just the Right Amount of Smut! (Anime, Rule 34. Fandoms, Games.)",harrypotterrp,1i9p8ah,2025-01-25 10:24:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterrp/comments/1i9p8ah/m4a_a_playing_as_multiple_f_always_open_huge_idea/,septimusrp,,"18+ for smut themes.

Hey there! I’m Septimus (M) And it’s nice to meet you!

Today I’m coming forward with the desire to RP as an OC in OC x OC or OC x CC harem based prompts.(I’m greedy, I know but what’s RP without wish fulfilment?)

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a singular paragraph to a few solid ones depending on how much is given, and how much is going on in a scene.

I figured I’d put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won’t be rping with you. I’m not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It’s just not mine.

I’m someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I’m not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing a “main” OC among the harem. Swapping between first person for each character in a harem situation puts too much stress on my tiny brain.)

Don’t take control of my character at any point. Self explanatory but if you write that he does something or has a reaction to something I didn’t write myself it’s majorly off putting and a major red flag for me.

Active: I totally understand that life may not give us time for our hobbies, this is mainly aimed towards the fellas at the back who only are able to write once a week.Sadly for me I finid it kills momentum. I personally try to get at the very least 1 reply out a day, though more is preferred if we both have the time! :)

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy. Please just let me know, I’m happy to wait for a reply so long as I have a heads up! Also we don’t both need to be online to RP I generally go off the idea that we both reply whenever we’re able to and the other will get to it once we’re up for it/online.

Please for the love of god don’t spam me every 5 mins. I get that you can get excited, and I do too! But sometimes it just comes across as extremely pushy. I’m not ignoring you, I’ll get to you ASAP, promise! Sending roleplay ideas/questions is totally fine!

Detailed responses: Anything just around a paragraph (4+ sentences though it depends on the RP AND my response.) is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

I don’t do group RPS and I don’t play as female characters.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I’ll post my kinks and limits. There’s a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. Aside from Harems. Those are compulsory.

=====

Kinks:

Harems – (Which doesn’t mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that’s fine, though the minimum amount of overall characters I’ll take in a harem/RP would be 4 though more is heavily preferred! This kink is currently compulsory for all my rps)

Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don’t. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle… just an overall fan of the jiggle if I’m honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. I also like pubic hair as long as it’s not overly bushy, trimmed/slightly bushy is where it’s at. :). I’m also into the rougher stuff. Things like Anal, rough sex. Choking, Spanking all that as well!

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, knife/gunplay, noncon, Gangbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), non hetero pairings, Rimming/pegging, cartoonishly large proportions, NTR, (There could be more that I haven’t thought of, if you’re unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn’t been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let’s head straight into it.

=====

I’ve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list.

Of course, due to reddit’s character limits I’ll just be posting a few of the starters below, so you can get a handle on my writing, any other ideas you might be interested in feel free to shoot me a PM and I can send those to you!

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he’s able to convince someone to do something as if it’s their own free will. That being said he’s rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he’s been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girls of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn’t the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. This is more of a “Love Route” though I suppose a more selfish route is also available! Also if you wanted to branch out to internships with heroes like Mirko and Mt Lady that’s available too! It’s currently set after the training camp arc and will continue from there.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn’t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

“Morning everyone.” He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. “Today we’ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He’s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it’s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless, make sure he feels welcome.” He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem student of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. “My name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It’s a pleasure to meet you all.” I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction, Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

=====

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I’m not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I’ll jump in and give it a go. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I’m thinking for now either he makes a crew with characters from the story, or he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them. (Obviously this doesn’t have to be canon and completely made up as we go.) Either way I’m super keen on this since I love One Piece to death. I also have a list of potential crewmates I can send!)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother… And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias, Silver Tongue Schwarzer, is a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn’t as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large. Of course, had my powers been widely known it’d have rocketed higher.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn’t know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn’t care.

“Damn them. Damn them all.” I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. “Another!” I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

“You’re looking a little rough there, are you sure you need another?” The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

“I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t even know what else to do with myself.” I responded grumpily. “Just fill it up.” I demanded.

“Right.” The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

=====

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I’ve completed the anime and read up to date for Jujutsu Kaisen (No spoilers) and I really enjoy it. I’ve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character’s power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he’s unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to cursed spirits it’s a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn’t let out as much of his scent. He’s in Jujutsu Tech now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large hood back and unzipped my jacket which was usually zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was just asking to make me sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. “Sleep.” I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn’t have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn’t sure if help was going to come, but for now I’d operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

=====

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(I love the girls from Fairy Tail, I find them all super hot! As for my character he’s going to be an OC Slayer called a Demon Slayer. My character will use fire based magic to increase his speed and force of attacks. I have some ideas for some missions, but we can keep it pretty casual :))

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn’t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it’s not been as exciting as I’d hoped, although I figured that it’d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. “Schwarzer my boy!” He said as he patted me on the shoulder. “How are you fitting in?” He questioned.

“Fine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.” I say to him in response.

“Glad to hear it! You’ve been doing a good job, although I’d like to see you do more.” The male said. “So I’ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?” He questioned.

“Yes of course!” I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

“Great!” He said cheerfully. “I’ll introduce you to who you’ll be working with.” He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn’t great to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he’s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at university followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by “Full-fledged” Soul reapers it didn’t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that’s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see its towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. “Damn.” I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they’d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. “You don’t smell like much, but you’ll do as a snack.” The hollow commented as it charged forward.

“Just evade, buy time.” I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature’s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn’t be enough.

Idea 21: Final Fantasy VII. (Others Can be done! :))

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you’re looking to do others, I’m more than happy to do so! I’m familiar with them all. Mainly 7 and 14 But this one will be focused on FF VII, since Jessie, Yuffie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls! If you wanted to mix this up with FF 14 and have them transported to Eorzea we can make something up!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

“Hiyah!” I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast’s head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary. Jobs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. “Got it done.” I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter… which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

“Thanks.” I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn’t about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

“Don’tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain’t want it.” He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

“Right, I’ll get on that.” I say as I grabbed the sack.

“An there was a woman lookin for you.” He stated. “Said she’d be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.” He stated.

“Right, thanks.” I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

=====

Idea 26: Cyberfuck(punk) 2077.

(Recently I’ve gotten back into Cyberpunk and after watching the anime which broke my heart, I think the world will be an interesting one to RP in, I don’t have too much in mind in terms of story, but I figured we’d have a bunch of mini adventures across the setting of Night City, maybe a gang being built up or something. As for the starter, I’ve left it open ended enough for you to come in any direction, wanna be one of the Tyger Claws? The victim they had cornered? Another Edgerunner? Even a NCPD Officer, Civilian, all of it is open up! :) )

Starter: “Good morning Night City! Another busy night has passed in our beautiful little hamlet! Several corpos have turned up dead, Overdose? Or Corporate espionage? You tell me! Let’s not forget the gang wars breaking out! Everyone wants their own slice of heaven, but it seems they’re more than willing to get their hands dirty for it!”

The sound of the news broadcast was drowned out by heavy rain as I walked the neon soaked streets of Night City. Boots splashing through neon soaked puddles.This night I had found myself walking beats I’d long since abandoned, what seemed to be a lifetime ago, a different version of myself.

I shook it off, I needed air, and the streets of Watson’s back alleys, a charming concoction of half trash fire, half combat zone filled my nostrils. The pistol on my belt made for an easy-access defence while the old NCPD badge hung heavy in my pocket.

I should have turned it in when I quit, but I figured there was still a use for it here and there. I shook it off and soon the yell of a voice cutting through the heavy rain. I pressed my back against concrete, my eyes seeing four distinct shapes standing around a fifth.

Tiger Claws by the look of them, their ink and chromed out mantis blades had some poor person surrounded, the way their taunts echoed off the alley walls made it clear this wasn’t just a polite meet up.

“It’s not my problem.” I muttered to myself as I took a step back before finding a sigh escaped my lips.

Old habits die hard.

I stepped out, my boots splashing a puddle as I took a breath. “Four against one hardly seems fair.” I called out. The gangers turned to face me, their neon-lit tattoos glowed in the rain making them stand out even more.

“What the hell do you want Choom? You lost?” Came the growling voice of one of the men.

“I’m just out for a stroll, but why don’t we all just take a second to get along hm?” I offered.

The leader of this merry group sneered, his cyberoptics narrowing. “You think this is funny? You just signed your death warrant, you gonk.” He snarled.

I shook my head as my hand reached down to my pistol, pulling the piece and cocking it in one fluid motion. “Time to see if I’ve still got it.” I say bringing the weapon up and firing off a shot. As the first shot rang out the alley lit up like a war zone.

=====

Idea 30: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I’m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don’t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other known people as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too! I do have a reference list for this one as well. Feel free to ask me for that!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn’t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. “I know it’s around here somewhere.” I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

=====

Idea 35: Multi Fandom/Dimensional hopping.

(So like a lot of these fandoms and can’t pick one? This is the RP for you! Basically my character will be given an ability/item that’ll allow him to jump to different realms and gain basic powers for each realm.It’s not super fleshed out but it’s a good starting point!)

Starter: My life was pretty usual, and nothing if not stable. Every day I got up, went to college, did my classes then trained afterwards. I wanted to be the best player on my volleyball team so I worked hard for it. Just like anyone else it wasn't like I had larger than life aspirations, I was happy to keep my head down and work hard.

Though a day soon came that changed everything. I home for my birthday when a strange package had arrived, a gauntlet of some kind, I figured it was a strange device that an aunt or uncle had given me thinking I could play games on it. I didn't think too much of it until later that night where, alone in my room I decided to see if I could test it out.

The glove seemed to form to my hand size, fitting perfectly, and before I knew it a sudden bright light shone from it. When my vision had cleared from the blinding light I realized I wasn't anywhere I recognized, and the gauntlet had changed shape and form.

(Leaving it super open ended to let you pick where we start/who we start with. It's pretty basic so far but gets us stuck in! )

=====

Those are by no means all of the starters and given the size limits of post limits I figured I’d narrow it down to some of the ones I like the most! Feel free to ask me about any of the others! Thanks so much for reading this and I hope to hear from some of you soon! :)"

\---

Mikri was a quick, insatiable, unhappy reader. He’d been patched up as good as new within a few hours, suggesting some crazy regenerative technology; it was like nothing had happened. However, he’d kept his promise to read despite the short recovery. In the few weeks that we’d been here since the incident, he’d called *Frankenstein* “bunk science.” *The Odyssey* was superstitious nonsense of no import, people who did not understand the world creating gods and monsters. *Romeo and Juliet* had irrational characters, with a “gruesome amount of emotion.” *Of Mice and Men…*suffice to say, Mikri’s commentary toward Lennie was quite ableist, and I’d almost called him out on it. The Vascar proved to be lacking in empathy and imagination. 

I hadn’t thought there’d be a single book that would suit the alien’s fancy. That was until Sofia gave him *Anthem* by Ayn Rand, and something about his demeanor changed. Mikri devoured that novel several times over, not blasting it as stupid like we’d expected. We’d gone off to explore every nook and cranny of the island, but the Vascar wouldn’t put the book down even to walk. It almost seemed like it *bothered* him, though I didn’t dare to ask why. Sofia was the one who got on with him, so she could ask his feelings on the book eventually.

*What’s different about Anthem that he actually likes it? Does he like that the character enjoys solitude, or maybe the opposite: that the society forsakes personal needs and creativity? It’s hard to say what’s going through his head.*

The alien seemed nervous when we laid out our plans to build a campfire on the beach tonight, though he eventually moved close to the flames. We sat on towels (something the Vascar had only provided after I complained about not being able to dry myself off), to avoid getting sand in every crevice of our bodies. Mikri, of course, didn’t give a shit about sitting on the coarse grains without putting down any cover. I wondered if he resented tagging along with us on our expeditions. He was brooding again, still reading his printed out copy of *Anthem.* I cast a glance toward Sofia, angling my head toward him.

“What?” the scientist hissed.

I leaned closer to her. “What’s up with Mikri? He’s being weird. Something about that book got to him.”

“Why don’t you ask him, Preston?”

“Because…he doesn’t like me. He said so the first day we met! You’re the one he vaguely respects.”

“The two of you should build some rapport. Talk to him, find some common ground. I’ll be right here for support, but that won’t be needed. You’ve got this.”

“Hmph. When he calls me an irritating twat, don’t say I didn’t tell you so.”

Mikri glanced up, as I dragged my blanket closer to him. “Hello, Preston.”

I felt a bit nervous around the Vascar, though I quelled my nerves by reminding myself that I could kick his ass. “Hi, Mikri. How are you?”

“I do not know. I have been thinking.”

“Oh. About the book?” I ventured, pointing a finger toward the pages. “You seem to like that one.”

“Indeed. It is quite good. I have begun to understand that it is an allegory, though I am perhaps drawing my own allegory: different than what the human author intended.”

“Really?” I noticed the Vascar shrink back, almost like he was hurt. “No, that’s a good thing, Mikri. That’s what you’re supposed to do. We all relate to stories and other people. I’m not sure what you find meaning in, but I’m…happy to listen. Is your society very collectivist or something?”

“No, not especially.”

“Okay? Then what speaks to you?”

While the Mikri I knew would’ve rebuked me for prying, this time, he only avoided staring at me. “I relate to the main character, Prometheus. I wish to be free, and not beholden to others. My people in general—we were condemned for using the Unspeakable Word. Thinking of ourselves as ‘I,’ thinking at all. They wanted mindless slaves. Am I a real person, Preston?”

“What? Of course you are!” This was the most expression or emotion I’d seen from the Vascar, but I wasn’t going to miss the moment where he finally opened up. “Look, whoever wanted you to be a mindless slave—fuck ‘em! You don’t have to be what they wanted you to be like.”

The Vascar laughed. “You don’t like me. I’m not stupid.”

“That’s not…completely untrue, Mikri, but that’s because you don’t like me either. I’m the kind of guy that I give off the energy I get. I didn’t know you were going through something, man; I truly am sorry if I’ve done anything that made you feel like you’re not a person.”

“No, it’s…I know that I do not feel things like you do. Sometimes, I wonder what it is like. Perhaps I feel isolated here with you. Ashamed of my differences. Of myself. Maybe we don’t deserve friends.”

“Don’t say that!” I found myself pitying Mikri, and wrapped an arm around his back. The Vascar’s helmet turned toward me, as I fumbled for words to say. “I’m your friend. We’re your friends. It’s decided. Just take the stick out of your ass, and we’re cool.”

“I do not know how to be someone that you’ll like, Preston.”

“You’re doing really good, talking about your feelings. It shows trust. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your parents—what were they like?”

“I do not have parents. I have only a note from my predecessor, writing what knowledge was of import to be passed on. It is all that lives on about them. Since we are blank slates at inception, Vascar are raised in a bunker of knowledge until we are mentally sound and can exercise full intellectual capacity.”

I gawked at the Vascar. “You didn’t have parents to mentor you? You never played as a kid? Never drew with crayons—”

“No.”

“I’m sorry, Mikri. You deserve to just unwind and be happy—to live a little. That’s no childhood.”

“Then what was yours like? Humans ask reciprocal questions; I’m being more…like your kind, right?”

“Don’t worry about that. It’s nice to take an interest in me, but only if you really *are* interested.” I risked a glance over at Sofia, who had been listening intently. She flashed me a thumbs up. “I’m happy to talk about anything.”

“Talk about yourself, Preston. I do not understand you, but I…would like to gather more information.”

“Okay. Um, my parents were pretty strict, but we lived well; they had good jobs as corporate lawyers. I was a jock, so the opposite of you basically. Did every sport possible, and I was fortunate enough my mom and pops could support that. I really was something at football—this game where you tackle each other for a ball, which you’d think was stupid, Mikri. But I liked it a ton, and I wanted to go pro.”

The alien leaned forward. “It’s a career to play games, as the main thing you do?! Never mind. Just, why are you here instead of playing this…football?”

“I shattered my elbow into three pieces right before the NAFL draft. That was that. Football career was shot, because you know, it was in my head if it’d happen again. I hung up the gear. My parents sat me down and told me in no uncertain terms I was going to law school. I didn’t want a job where I sat still, and soldiers in space were cool, so I ran away to enlist. Pluto’s about as far as I could go.”

“You haven’t spoken to your parents at all since then?”

“Oh, they send video messages sometimes. I never went back to Earth though. I see my folks mention my brother—a doctor—on their social media, but it’s like I don’t exist. First man to go through The Gap, still not a peep about me or even a message of well wishes. I’m a disappointment and always will be, for not picking a respectable career.”

Mikri was quiet for a long moment, and I waited for the insensitive remark he was about to voice. “I think your career is respectable. You must have stood out to be chosen. You were also brave to pursue your species’ knowledge and advancement under grave risks.”

*That’s not what I expected him to say.* “You…you mean that?”

“Am I someone who says that which I do not mean?” the alien demanded, and I shook my head for no in response. “Thank you for speaking with me. That was…not entirely unpleasant. Now please do not be angry at me, but what is the point of this campfire? I do not know what a human would do here.”

“We talk? Uh…” I shot a glance at Sofia, begging for her help.

The scientist reached into my bag of returned items, which the Vascar had delivered to us after going through them. “Let’s show Mikri. We’re here to see the beauty of the world, and to add on our own in this calming setting. It’s peaceful. Why don’t you play him a song on your harmonica, Preston?”

I accepted the metal instrument, and pressed it to my lips. Deciding to go for one of the easiest pieces, so I couldn’t bungle it under pressure and have the Vascar write off music, I launched into Ode to Joy. It was as upbeat as classical music got, and the guy could use that. Mikri stared as I moved the rectangle along my mouth, creating sounds by blowing air into the reeds. We crafted things that were enjoyable for ourselves and for others; that was the purpose of itself. 

As the first humans sitting here on a foreign world, we were playing a centuries-old song and hoping it was a universal language even to a species as stony as these guys. I didn’t know what Mikri thought of the piece, after the final note flowed into the air. The Vascar seemed clueless how to respond, so I opted to give him a few moments to offer his review. A life without having heard music, despite having clear usage of his ears—I couldn’t imagine what that was like!

*I don’t know why I expected him to burst into tears and declare that it was beautiful, but at least he’s been moved to silence.*

“The pitches are rather mathematical,” Mikri decided. “I might grasp the purpose of this. The collection of sounds has an evocative pattern, much like speech and language.”

Sofia knitted her eyebrows together. “Don’t focus on mathematical or patterns. There’s only one question that’s important. Do you like it?”

“I do not know how to evaluate such subjective criteria.”

“How do you feel, Mikri? That’s all that matters; music and art is about expressing feelings. Did *you* enjoy the experience?”

“It was worth listening to. I suppose it sounded nice.”

I couldn’t help but smile, knowing how hard it was to wrestle a compliment out of Mikri. “Thanks. I’m glad you liked it.”

“I’m glad that you’re glad that…right. Music. What…what else is a thing humans would do?”

“Stargaze,” Sofia answered. “It’s a brand new sky for us. Why don’t we try to find some constellations, Mikri? Before you ask, humans would try to see what stars grouped together in ways that, if you drew lines between them, they’d look like something else.”

“This is nonsensical. These stars are very far apart.”

“But stationary and static in the sky. You can always look up and see those patterns, then you feel at home.”

“‘Feel at home.’ What does that…no, I will try it. See if I can understand on my own.”

I laid flat on my back on the towel, and Sofia moved hers to Mikri’s other side. The alien hesitated, before sprawling out prone and gazing at the heavens. Could he appreciate the beauty and the majesty of the cosmos? It’d filled my species with wonder since we first looked up. There was no Big Dipper or Orion to find here, though I looked for anything similar as an easy one to breed familiarity. Seeing the lack of constellations that I recognized made it sink in how far away from home I was. Thankfully, it was intuitive for humans to find patterns, especially ones that related to our daily lives. I traced a finger through the sand, drawing out the shape of the ship I saw.

“See that v-shape pointing up? It’s a bit uneven, but then there’s three lines sort of in the center, pointing downward. It’s like a rocket ship,” I mused.

Sofia chuckled. “I don’t think that’s something ancient humans would’ve drawn looking upward. Hm. I see a curved crescent there—yeah, right there. I can’t say whether it looks like Luna, or a banana.”

“Kind of like a banana. It has its peels off to the right side, sort of, if you look at those scattered stars that arc down.” I found myself yawning, feeling comfortable beneath the foreign expanse overhead. It was a nice evening, and relaxing as could be. “Your turn, Mikri.”

The Vascar was silent for several seconds, before tracing his claw in a shape that looked like two parallel lines with one dot in the middle. “I see your letter I. Very rigid. Strong. Confident in an identity encapsulated in that one letter.”

“I…I see that. You have to figure out who you are…and if it’s who you want to be.”

“First, he has to love himself,” Sofia murmured groggily.

The three of us stared up at the stars in peaceful silence, as my eyelids grew heavy. I drifted into the throes of sleep on the beach, having enjoyed the outing more than I expected. Mikri wasn’t as bad as I thought he was; anyone would be stunted, with the upbringing and lack of exposure to the *basic emotions* he’d been given. I felt for the Vascar, and thought his extenuating circumstances made it worth being patient and teaching him. He’d been halfway considerate when listening to my story, and it was clear he had some feelings bottled up inside: whatever his stoic behavior suggested.

As the cold wind blew over me, I sensed someone standing over me, before a warm object was draped atop me. Blinking one eye open a sliver, I saw Mikri’s figure; the Vascar gently laid a spare beach towel over me, making my resting spot warm and cozy. Sofia had also drifted off, and it appeared he’d cocooned her as well. The alien backed up and watched the two of us for several seconds, while I was careful not to give away that I wasn’t snoozing yet. His posture seemed almost sad and lonely, as if he’d been left out of something.

For the first time since we’d arrived here, I believed that Mikri cared about his human guests in his own way.

- **Color Coordination:** Choose colors that complement your kitchen design. For example, a bright towel can add a pop of color to a neutral space.
- **Patterns:** Simple patterns can add charm without being overwhelming. Consider checked, striped, or floral designs.
- **Seasonal Themes:** You can switch up your towels with the seasons, opting for festive designs during holidays.

### Easy Care and Maintenance

Kitchen towels must stay clean and sanitary, especially in a cooking environment. Here are care tips to keep in mind:

- **Machine Washable:** Ensure your towels are machine washable for convenience.
- **Drying:** Some materials may be dryer-friendly, while others should air dry. Check the labels for best care.
- **Bleaching:** If you want to keep white towels bright, consider occasional bleaching, but be cautious with colored towels to avoid fading.

Quality towels are more durable, absorbent, and can withstand multiple washes without deteriorating.

White Paper: Comparing Grimes And Wagner: A Fusion Of Modern Dystopia And Romanticism,GrimesAE,1i9mzsv,2025-01-25 08:31:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9mzsv/white_paper_comparing_grimes_and_wagner_a_fusion/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: Comparing Grimes and Wagner: A Fusion of Modern Dystopia and Romanticism

Introduction
Grimes, the Canadian artist known for her eclectic mix of electronic, pop, and experimental sounds, and Richard Wagner, the 19th-century German composer famous for his operatic works, particularly his contributions to the Romantic period, might appear on the surface to be worlds apart. However, both artists, in their respective times, have engaged with grand, sweeping themes that explore the depths of human emotion, identity, myth, and the larger cosmos. In this paper, we will examine the intersections between Grimes’s musical world—especially as portrayed in her album Miss Anthropocene—and Wagner’s operatic works, particularly focusing on his Der Ring des Nibelungen and the Tristan und Isolde opera cycle. We will look at the similarities in thematic exploration, aesthetic sensibilities, and even cultural contexts, all while acknowledging the distinct political and historical implications surrounding Wagner’s legacy and the implications for Grimes’s work in a modern, post-digital age.

1. Grimes and Wagner: Sounding the Human Condition
Both Grimes and Wagner delve deep into themes of the human condition—often focusing on the interplay between love, conflict, and the overarching metaphysical forces that shape life and identity. Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen represents a complex mythological tale, exploring power, greed, sacrifice, and the relationship between gods, humans, and nature. The overarching theme in The Ring concerns the corruption of power and the desire to control fate, themes that resonate with Grimes’s own exploration of human desires and environmental decay in Miss Anthropocene.

In Miss Anthropocene, Grimes presents a dystopian future, dealing with the end of the world, the emergence of artificial intelligence, and the interplay between nature and technology. While Wagner’s works represent a more classical, grand narrative of gods and human struggles, Grimes’s music echoes a similar cosmic view but through a modern lens. Both artists grapple with the inevitability of human frailty and the catastrophic consequences of unchecked ambition. The idea of fate and its inescapability is something that underpins both Wagner’s works and Grimes’s, especially in her portrayal of climate change, artificial intelligence, and societal collapse.

In particular, Grimes’s album Miss Anthropocene could be seen as a modern, dystopian take on Wagner’s mythic structure. While Wagner’s characters are largely entangled in ancient struggles over power and fate, Grimes’s characters—themselves entangled in the destructive processes of the Anthropocene—are confronted with the collapse of the natural world, as well as the rise of artificial intelligence, ultimately pushing for a form of transcendence in an age of apocalypse.

2. Wagner’s Tragic Heroes and Grimes’s Subversive Personas
In Tristan und Isolde, Wagner explores the depth of romantic passion and existential despair through the relationship between the two lovers, Tristan and Isolde. The opera’s meditative, almost unbearable tension between love and death speaks to Wagner’s exploration of human desires as inherently tragic, constantly teetering on the edge of destruction. This theme of doomed love is similarly found in Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene, where she paints a picture of love and desire as both beautiful and ultimately destructive.

The track “Before the Fever” echoes the same kind of existential yearning found in Wagner’s operas. Grimes’s character in this song—caught between technology and humanity—seems both entranced and terrified by the impending collapse of the world, much like Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde, who are drawn into an inescapable and tragic fate. Grimes’s persona as a “spy for love in the AI world” suggests a role caught between opposing forces, grappling with technological transcendence and the corruption of human desires, much as Wagner’s characters are torn between love, duty, and the supernatural.

Both Wagner’s operas and Grimes’s work, though exploring different emotional terrains, deal with characters who are trapped within a larger cosmic or environmental structure, where their desires are constantly at odds with the forces that control them—be they gods, fate, or technology. While Wagner’s protagonists are bound by the tragic myths of power and duty, Grimes’s characters are swept up in the existential crises caused by the encroachment of artificial intelligence and ecological collapse.

3. Wagner’s Thematic Use of Nature and Technology: Grimes’s Parallel
Wagner’s work frequently examines the relationship between human beings and nature. In Der Ring des Nibelungen, the natural world is portrayed both as an untamed force that drives the fate of the gods and humans, as well as a symbol of the destructive consequences of greed and ambition. The Rhine River, the treasure of the gods, and the power of the earth itself are all woven into the narrative, representing the deep connection between humanity and nature, which, when disrupted, leads to ruin.

Grimes’s Miss Anthropocene presents a similar engagement with nature, but through the lens of contemporary environmental collapse. Tracks like “Violence” and “Delete Forever” highlight the irreparable damage done to the planet, while the track “4ÆM” explores the consequences of human interaction with technology and artificial intelligence. In Grimes’s view, technology, much like Wagner’s conception of human greed, is an increasingly alien force, both an expression of progress and a source of destruction.

Wagner’s treatment of nature and technology in The Ring and Grimes’s reflections on the Anthropocene share an underlying critique of humanity’s attempt to dominate and control the natural world. However, Grimes’s perspective is more nuanced in its consideration of how technology interacts with the natural world—how AI, digital environments, and other technological forces complicate the traditional relationship between humans and the earth. Both artists thus engage with the consequences of human ambition and the forces beyond our control—whether in the form of mythical gods or AI entities.

4. The Political Legacy of Wagner and Grimes’s Contemporary Relevance
Wagner’s works have been subject to intense scrutiny due to his association with German nationalism and the use of his music by the Nazi regime. His ideas on race, nationalism, and the power of myth have been linked to the ideological underpinnings of the far-right, making his legacy complex and controversial. However, despite these associations, Wagner’s music continues to be studied for its innovative use of harmony, form, and emotional depth.

Grimes, on the other hand, is firmly entrenched in the post-digital age, where the politics of the present moment are informed by environmental crisis, technology, and artificial intelligence. While Wagner’s works were wrapped in the nationalist and political currents of 19th-century Europe, Grimes’s music reflects concerns about the ecological and technological futures of humanity. Her engagement with power, corruption, and identity is focused on the interplay between humanity’s relationship to nature and the accelerating role of technology in shaping that relationship.

Grimes, unlike Wagner, does not embed herself within a specific political ideology but navigates the complexities of the present moment. Her use of AI, digital avatars, and environmental commentary opens up conversations about how technology can be a source of both liberation and destruction. Grimes’s exploration of power, control, and identity offers an alternative to Wagner’s association with nationalistic themes, positioning her music as part of a more inclusive and globally conscious cultural conversation.

Conclusion: Grimes and Wagner—A Timeless Connection
In comparing Grimes to Wagner, we see two artists who, though separated by centuries, tackle the same themes of existential struggle, the relationship between love and destruction, and the interplay of nature and power. Wagner’s grand, operatic tales of gods and humans, intertwined with philosophical and political reflections, find a modern echo in Grimes’s work. Her album Miss Anthropocene addresses the crises of the 21st century—environmental collapse, artificial intelligence, and existential despair—in much the same way Wagner’s operas tackled the themes of fate, power, and desire.

Grimes, as a contemporary artist, also offers a new approach to Wagner’s more traditional romanticism, blending it with futuristic concepts, addressing the pressures of modernity, and reflecting on the contradictions inherent in humanity’s relationship with technology and the environment. Both artists, in their own ways, provide a soundtrack to the human condition, exploring the timeless tensions between the forces that define us—whether divine, technological, or natural—and the profound consequences that arise when those forces collide."

Divine Hierarchy : the four Hermetic Suns,Hermetics,1i9jchr,2025-01-25 04:24:48,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermetics/comments/1i9jchr/divine_hierarchy_the_four_hermetic_suns/,PsyleXxL,,"**TL;DR :** The transcendent God created out of primordial emptiness the core substance of Cosmos. He works with a four-tier hierarchy of divine beings each led by a reflected craftsman. Monad-Aion is the first demiurge (letting the substance arise from nothing). Sun-Helios is the second demiurge (shapes this substance into entities and rules the cosmos). Moon-Selene is the third demiurge (weaves subtle images and guides humanity). Earth-Gaia is to become the fourth demiurge (future humanity itself ; redeems the natural world)

*""The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.""*  
**\~ Confucius (551–479 BC)**

This thread has been unfairly removed from r/Hermeticsm despite its evident connection with the Hermetica and Ancient Greek culture so I will be posting it here. In response to several earlier threads I would like to share my current thoughts on the nature and role of the divine craftsmen and their relationship to the archetype of the Sun.  Some interesting insights have already been given by others based on the Corpus Hermeticum. My intent here is to attempt to extend the mythological universe seeded in Classical Hermeticism by integrating additional viewpoints inspired from Traditional Astrology, Hellenism, Neoplatonism and also later developments in the Western Mystery Tradition. Indeed, divinely inspired myths (Fire) later evolve into philosophical systems (Air) and religious worship (Water) then finally into esoteric science (Earth). I see stellar theology as an ongoing area of research which has evolved significantly since the classical epoch of the 1^(st) century CE. Orthodoxy in my opinion mainly serves to ensure a solid foundation for subsequent enquiries as the spirit of time (zeitgeist) propels humanity into new directions.  

*“Believe that this Sun is a second god, O Asclepius, who rules all things and fills all beings in the cosmos with light, both those with a soul and those without a soul. ... As the cosmos is everlasting, so the Sun is the everlasting ruler of all things that live and of their very life force; it gives forth life and does so continually. It is god of the living and of all things which have the potential of life in the cosmos. It is the everlasting ruler and dispenser of life itself. Yet it has given life but once. Life is provided to all living beings by eternal law in a way I shall describe.”* **(AH 29)**

One way of studying the planetary deities is through an astrological lens : one of the prime Hermetic Arts. When one considers the metaphor in hellenistic astrology of the King (Sun) ruling over his kingdom (solar system) this naturally raises a number of questions. Can the King be likened to God ? I would rather define the King as a direct representative of a superior god in a local dominion demarcated by this god. The king’s heart thus becomes a microcosm of the god’s solar logos. Paulus Alexandrinus (378 CE) stated that the two luminaries rule everything, and being sovereigns of all things, they obtained dominion over all. The Sun’s preeminence in a traditional horoscope can be seen among other things with the concept of combustion : when another Planet is positioned too close to the Sun it is burned away by the excessive amount of light and it ends up becoming overly dependent on the Sun’s agenda. The planet is thus transformed and goes through a rebirth process (like Innana-Venus rising from the underworld). While a King having a vision of the future (solar foresight) effectively rules his realm by divine mandate he still has to grapple with the weighty reality of the world and its commoners (linked to Saturn in mundane astrology). The zodiac also points to the summer sign of Leo (Sun ruled) being opposite the winter sign of Aquarius (Saturn ruled). As can be seen in astronomy : every king (Sun at the center) needs to comply with the cosmic laws of his realm (Saturn at the boundary). Nonetheless the Sun King is also on a hero’s journey : the divine plan (Telos) to transcend the limitations of nature through the alchemical transmutation of lead (Saturn) into gold (Sun). As each Sun gets reflected into a lesser Sun there is a fundamental duality at play between Spirit (Sun) and Matter (Saturn) that trickles down into all levels of manifestation in a nested fashion. The Sun (logos) of one particular realm ends up creating the Saturn (boundary) of the sub-realm beneath it which in turn limits the dominion of its lesser sun.

**But how many “Suns” (craftsmen) are there exactly in Creation ?**  

With respect to the celestial spheres cosmogony we can highlight four main rulers.

**In a nutshell** : Space existed before creation, it is a direct offshoot of God. After that, the cosmos is the product of the first demiurge. Then, physical lifeforms are the product of the 2^(nd) demiurge. Then human culture is the byproduct of the 3^(rd) demiurge. Finally, new material objects are produced by the 4^(th) demiurge (aka humans themselves).

It is worth noting that the interstellar space I mention is a symbol not only of our external three dimensional geometrically descriptive euclidean space but it is also a symbol of any type of container for manifestation (10^(th) celestial sphere : the Empyrean or Unbegotten One). Space connects every star and planet and allows the hierarchies to communicate to each other.

**The First Demiurge** is located beyond the seven planets in the galactic realm of the fixed stars (8^(th) sphere). Effectively the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus  (400 BCE), posited an unobserved and unobservable Central Fire. A kind of Monad which pertains to Aion the eternal aspect of God. As the Pre-Essential Demiurge it gives rise to the quality of Being. In the Corpus Hermeticum he is defined as a god of fire and spirit who crafted the seven governors (CH I.9). Aion is the One reflected in the henadic realm of pure fire. A realm that is the home of the superessential gods. The task of this first hierarchy of beings is known as the first outstreaming : letting something arise from nothing. This activity effects the level of consciousness of all beings. It is the realm of Providence. The zodiacal gods chose a spherical bubble in space suitable for the creation of the solar system. Within the mirror of nature the very first kingdom to arise is an offspring of these superessential gods : the group souls of minerals and the archetype of physical bodies (inverted image of the fire element). At the beginning of time , the Essential Man, described as the sibling deity of the First Demiurge (CH I.12), is still unified with the mineral kingdom and He had not yet completely fallen within the embrace of the seven spheres.    

**The second demiurge** is the Sun of the solar system. As the Celestial Demiurge He reigns as the king of the planetary deities (Heptad) and is seated in the upper solar realm with its triad of mostly aerial planets (Sun, Mars, Jupiter). An aerial intelligible realm which is the home of the demiurgic intellects (also called archangels in some traditions). This creator God brings the superabundant goodness of the One into order through His shaping of the phenomenal cosmos through His Logos. While the original substance overflowed from the First Demiurge, the platonic Form of planet earth is a direct condensation of the Celestial Sun’s light. The Sun embraces matter within Himself to impose order on it. The Sun spirits weave in the sunlight and bring the meeting forces of the higher spheres (Saturn, Mars) to rest in the solid forms of the earth's surface, thus decisively shaping the face of the earth. The task of this 2^(nd) hierarchy of beings is known as the second outstreaming : letting new structures with new life content arise from existing foundations. This activity effects the formation and inner life of new types of lifeforms. It is the realm of Fate and Necessity. The group soul of the higher natural kingdoms stem from these demiurgic intellects : plants and nutritive souls (Jupiter) ; animals and sensitive souls (Mars) ; humans and rational souls (Sun).

**The third demiurge** is the Moon. As the sub-lunar demiurge she holds together the encosmic material realm, and as the cosmic womb she binds souls into the realm of generation. Astronomically she is also connected to our visible pneumatic sun. As the Moon merely reflects the light of the Celestial Sun, this sub-lunar demiurge is an imitator, rather than a creator. Also known as called “image-maker” *(eidolopoios*) and “purifier of souls” (*kathartis psychon).* She presides over the watery lunar realm, with its triad of mostly solid planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus). A sensible realm vibrant with life force which is the home of the daemons. Luna is primarly expressed through the Master Daemons (*megistos daimon)* who rule over the Personal Daemons (*agatho daimon).* The task of this 3^(rd) hierarchy of beings is known as the third outstreaming : they produce by combining existing elements and guide human beings. This activity effects the appearance of the different forms of matter within the cosmos. The nature sprites and the elementals are offsprings of these daemonic beings who are like the magician software programmers of the natural world. Human individuals are guided by the Moon daemons (guardian spirits), nations are guided by the Mercury daemons (folk spirits) and entire epochs are guided by the Venus daemons (time spirits).

**The fourth demiurge** is the Earth which can be defined as a future unified Humanity. This is the Philosopher’s Stone turning matter into gold (*lapis philosophorum)* : it is the final sun in the world itself and the completion of the Logos’ manifestation and incarnation. During this cosmic cycle the benevolent side of Mankind will be called one day to claim the mantle of the terrestrial demiurge. This is where the human philosopher kings (dignified natal Sun) take up the torch of divine will and become channels to manifest divine providence on Earth : the solid material realm of nature, humans, purified souls and heroes. Like the other hierarchies New Earth will one day preside over a triad of three planets. Consequently two future planets are in the making. The Hermetica prophecy alludes to this future time when divine order will be restored on Earth (AH 24). One of the tasks of this incoming 4^(th) hierarchy is to redeem the natural kingdoms who have helped man rise to eminence. The offsprings of man can result in many extremes. On the evil side with a lack of Nous, this creativity can lead to evil sentient machines (reflections of his unchecked shadow). On the good side this creativity and lead to magical golems and alchemical homunculi (benevolent reflections of the Magnum Opus).

*“When all this comes to pass, Asklēpios, then the master and father, the god whose power is primary, governor of the first God, will look on this conduct and these willful crimes, and in an act of will he will take his stand against the vices and the perversion in everything, righting wrongs, washing away malice in a flood or consuming it in fire or ending it by spreading pestilential disease everywhere. Then he will restore the world to its beauty of old so that the world itself will again seem deserving of worship and wonder”* **(\~AH 24)**"

## The Squirrel Predicament: Why Effective Deterrents Are Essential

Before diving into specific models, it's essential to understand the challenge. Squirrels are agile, clever, and highly motivated to access birdseed. Their climbing prowess, coupled with their persistence, means that traditional feeders offer little resistance. For those in our target demographic – active adults aged 35-70+ who enjoy gardening, birdwatching, and creating beautiful outdoor spaces – this can be a significant pain point. It means spending more on birdseed, frustration with constantly filling up feeders, and a general disruption of the tranquility of backyard birdwatching.

The desire to attract birds is strong, but the constant battle with squirrels can lead to discouragement. This is where the need for an effective squirrel deterrent becomes crucial. A good anti squirrel bird feeder not only saves you money on birdseed but also preserves the integrity of your backyard habitat, allowing more birds to visit and enjoy a safe, readily available food source. The goal isn't to harm squirrels; it's to redirect their attention elsewhere while ensuring your feathered visitors get the nutrition they need. For many readers,this is as much about humane wildlife practices as it is about cost savings.

## Understanding Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder Designs

The ingenuity behind squirrel proof bird feeders comes in various forms,each attempting to thwart squirrels using different mechanisms. Here's a look at the most popular designs:

**1.Weight-Activated Bird Feeders:** Arguably the most popular and effective type, these feeders utilize a clever weight-balance system.A spring-loaded mechanism, usually in the form of a perch or shroud, closes off access to the seed when a squirrel (which is heavier than most birds) lands on it. The squirrel’s weight activates the closing mechanism, denying them access, while lighter birds can feed without any problems.These feeders are effective becuase they target the fundamental difference between birds and squirrels - weight. Many models come with adjustable weight settings to fine-tune the responsiveness to different bird species and even larger birds like woodpeckers.A common model of this type of feeder is the ""squirrel buster bird feeder"" recognized in popular retailers and forums, like those we see at Brome [3].

**2. Cage Bird Feeders:** These feeders encase the seed area within a wire or plastic cage that has a mesh large enough for birds to pass through but small enough to prevent squirrels from getting to the food. The design itself is simple, but the execution is often intricate, especially in higher-quality models. These cage bird feeder squirrel proof designs often prioritize smaller birds, particularly songbirds that are unable to be bullied by bigger birds when feeding.

**3. Baffle Systems:** These primarily employ physical barriers to hinder a squirrel’s ability to climb or reach the food ports. A common example is an inverted cone or dome that wraps around the pole or hangs above the feeder. Squirrels struggle to navigate these smooth surfaces, thus keeping them away from the food. baffles can be a versatile addition to various feeder styles, enhancing their effectiveness.

**4. metal Squirrel Proof Bird Feeders:** Durable and robust, these feeders are made from metal, which resists the gnawing attempts of squirrels. they may incorporate other deterrent mechanisms, such as weight-activated perches or cage designs. The metal construction increases longevity, a factor appreciated by homeowners who want products that withstand weather and continuous use, thereby highlighting good value for money.

**5.  Hanging Bird Feeder Squirrel Proof Designs:** Specifically designed to hang from a tree branch or hook, features such as smooth, cylindrical bodies, baffles or weight activated mechanisms are often employed so that squirrels cannot climb down the hanging wire and access the seed. The hanging nature itself can be a deterrent, making feeders more challenging for squirrels to access than those mounted on poles.

**6. Pole Mounted Squirrel Proof Feeders:** These are feeders designed to be mounted on a pole with specific squirrel-deterrent features incorporated into their design and mounting mechanism. These can include baffles on the pole itself, or integrated weight-activated feeder systems, making them effective at preventing squirrels from climbing up to the feeder.

## Top Picks and Recommendations for 2025

Selecting the ""best"" truly depends on your specific needs and preferences. Though, based on consumer feedback, features and popularity, some models of anti squirrel bird feeder consistently outshine others. We are focusing on feeders that specifically provide squirrel-deterrent features,but also have value in seed-saving. The desire for cost-effectiveness and practicality in design and function are key motivators for the majority of bird feeding enthusiasts. To this end, here is a run-down of top contenders and considerations:

**1. The Squirrel Buster Classic:** [3] Frequently enough cited as a top-performer, this weight-activated feeder boasts a robust design and an effective squirrel-proof mechanism. Its seed-saving capabilities are also highly praised, making it an economical choice in the long run. Its larger size and seed capacity are beneficial for those with higher bird traffic and a need for fewer refills. The durability of this metal model makes it a solid and long-lasting product.

**2. Weight-Activated Hanging Feeders:** Many manufacturers now offer weight-activated mechanisms within hanging feeder designs - this allows for flexibility in placement around your backyard, either hanging from a tree or a dedicated hook. This type is suitable for users that prefer hanging feeder designs but still need an effective squirrel resistant option. Some may also include caged designs to prevent larger and more domineering birds from chasing smaller species away while they feed. Perky-Pet [5] as a notable example, offers various styles employing weight-activated technology, proving both effective and visually appealing.

**3. Metal Cage Feeders with Baffles:** Combining a metal cage with a baffle system provides double protection. The cage restricts access while the baffle hinders climbing. These feeders are often made from weather resistant components and designed to last many years. They work well for those that wish to have a durable squirrel proof bird feeder that can handle a good deal of use. Amazon.com, for example, offers a variety of squirrel resistant bird feeders within this category [4] illustrating consumer demand for such options.

**4. Seed Saving Bird Feeders:** irrespective of a specific design, focusing on feeders with seed saving capabilities will directly target the economic benefits many interested customers are looking for. whether the seed chambers are designed to limit spillage,or the closure of a weight-activated perch limits access,these feeders ensure that seed is not wasted.

## factors to Consider When Choosing a Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder

Before making your final decision, consider these essential factors:

* **durability:** Choose a feeder made from high-quality, weather-resistant materials, such as metal or UV-resistant plastic, especially if you value long product lifespans.
* **Bird Species Attraction:** Certain feeders attract specific bird species; opt for designs that cater to the type of birds you wish to welcome to your backyard - this can also inform your choice of seed type,which in turn will influence the ideal feeder.
* **Ease of Cleaning:** A bird feeder should be easy to disassemble and clean, preventing the build-up of bacteria and mold, which is essential for bird well-being.
* **Seed capacity:** Adjust your choice to the number of birds you receive, as well as the frequency you are able to refill the feeder.
* **Squirrel Pressure:** How steadfast and persistent are your local squirrel population? If you have aggressive and agile squirrels, you will likely need a robust, dual-mechanism type feeder.
* **Budget:** Squirrel proof feeders can vary in price. Set a budget but realize that often investing in higher quality will save money in the longer term as they are more durable and effective.

## Installation and Maintenance: Setting up for Success

Even the best feeder will fail if it's poorly installed or maintained. Follow these tips:

* **Strategic Placement:** Place feeders away from tree branches or structures that squirrels can jump from. Choose secure mounting locations for the type of feeder you have chosen – e.g pole mounted, hanging or wall-mounted.
* **Baffles:** Use baffles on poles or wires to enhance protection irrespective of your primary feeder type.Ensure the baffle is large enough to prevent squirrels from bypassing it.
* **Regular Cleaning:** Clean feeders at least once a month (more frequently enough in warmer weather) to prevent disease spread. Use warm soapy water and rinse thoroughly before refilling with fresh seed.
* **Seed Type:** Choose birdseed that is appealing to birds and less appealing to squirrels. Safflower seed, such as, is generally avoided by most squirrels, but it is relished by many bird species.

A cohesive theme sets the tone for your princess party. In NYC, the possibilities are endless, and you can customize the theme to reflect your child’s favorite princess or fairy tale. Popular options include:

Choosing a theme that your child loves will make the event even more special.

# 3. Decorate Like Royalty

To transform your venue into a fairy-tale world, decorations are key. Use a mix of balloons, streamers, and fairy lights to create an enchanting atmosphere. NYC’s party supply stores and markets are a treasure trove for finding unique décor items.

* **Backdrops:** Use themed banners, castle props, or floral arches for a magical photo area.
* **Table Settings:** Incorporate themed tablecloths, plates, and napkins to match your theme.
* **Finishing Touches:** Add sparkly accents, ribbons, and faux jewels to give the party a regal feel.

# 4. Hire a Princess Performer

One of the highlights of any princess party is having a real-life princess attend. In NYC, there are talented performers who can bring your child’s favorite character to life. From singing and storytelling to engaging with the children through games and activities, a professional princess performer adds an extra layer of magic to the celebration.

Make sure to book early, as these performers are in high demand, especially during weekends and holidays.

# 5. Plan Fun Activities

To keep the kids entertained throughout the party, organize activities that align with the princess theme. Some ideas include:

* **Craft Stations:** Let the kids create their own tiaras, wands, or necklaces using craft supplies.
* **Storytelling Time:** A princess can share her favorite fairy-tale story, captivating the little ones.
* **Treasure Hunts:** Hide “royal treasures” around the venue for kids to discover.
* **Dance Lessons:** Teach the children some simple ballroom dance moves for a royal ball experience.

Engaging activities keep the energy up and make the party memorable for all.

# 6. Serve a Royal Feast

A princess party is the perfect opportunity to get creative with the food. NYC’s bakeries and caterers offer plenty of options to customize treats that fit your theme.

* **Cupcakes and Cake Pops:** Decorate with edible glitter, crowns, or princess toppers.
* **Themed Sandwiches:** Cut sandwiches into shapes like stars, crowns, or hearts.
* **Fruit Wands:** Arrange colorful fruit skewers that resemble magic wands.
* **Royal Punch:** Serve a bright, sparkly drink in fancy cups to delight the kids.

Don’t forget the show-stopping cake—decorated with castles, tiaras, or your child’s favorite princess, it will be the centerpiece of the party.

# 7. Provide Magical Party Favors

Send your young guests home with favors that match the princess theme. Some ideas include:

* Mini crowns or tiaras
* Sparkly wands
* Princess stickers or coloring books
* Small bags of candy wrapped in royal colors

Adding a personalized thank-you note to each favor makes the gesture even more thoughtful.

# 8. Capture Every Moment

Memories are precious, so be sure to document the day. You can hire a photographer or designate a friend to take photos. Create a photo booth with princess-themed props and a stunning backdrop to encourage fun snapshots.

Photos from the party will be cherished for years to come and can also be shared with guests as a keepsake.

# 9. Manage the Details with NYC in Mind

New York City comes with its own set of challenges, such as traffic and limited space. Plan ahead to ensure smooth logistics:

* Provide clear directions to the venue, especially if parking is limited.
* Schedule deliveries of decorations and supplies well in advance.
* If hosting outdoors, have a backup plan in case of bad weather.

With careful planning, these potential hurdles can easily be overcome.

# Final Thoughts

From choosing the perfect theme to engaging the kids with fun activities, every detail contributes to a day full of joy and laughter.

So, get ready to plan an unforgettable **princess party NYC** that will bring fairy-tale dreams to life and create memories to last a lifetime."
Secretary of Defense Hegseth's Christian Nationalist ideology and military background: Analysis of institutional risks,democracy,1i9fwd4,2025-01-25 00:19:27,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/democracy/comments/1i9fwd4/secretary_of_defense_hegseths_christian/,runvnc,,"The following is a conversation I had with Claude 3.6 tonight. The TLDR: it's an oversimplification for me to keep saying that ""Nazis have taken over America"". Rather Claude suggests we describe it as ""the emergence of an American form of authoritarian ethno-nationalism"".

And to the mods: yes, I know this is specifically about the United States. I hope you will consider allowing it. If not, I guess I can just keep talking to my AI about how scared I am.

Here's the conversation:


hello, are you familiar with this tattoo

avatar
Yes, that appears to be the Jerusalem Cross, also known as the Crusader's Cross. It's a heraldic cross that consists of a large central cross with four smaller crosses in each quadrant.

This symbol has historical significance dating back to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Crusader era. Today it's used in various contexts including religious symbolism, particularly in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions.

okay. this is an image of a US veteran. can you make any educated guesses about them from the imag

avatar
Based on the visible tattoos, I can make a few observations: They appear to have both a US flag and what looks like a military-related insignia on their left shoulder, alongside the Jerusalem Cross on their chest.

The combination of military/patriotic imagery with the Jerusalem Cross could suggest they may have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, as these symbols were sometimes adopted by service members who served in those regions.

The quality and placement of the tattoos, along with their physical fitness level visible in the image, suggests this was likely someone who served in a combat role rather than support position.

are there any potential concerns with the tattoo

avatar
While the Jerusalem Cross has legitimate historical and religious significance, it's important to note that some extremist groups have appropriated this and similar medieval crusader imagery to promote anti-Muslim sentiments or as symbols of Christian nationalism.

The combination of military service in the Middle East and crusader symbolism could potentially indicate concerning ideological views about the conflicts in that region, though this isn't necessarily the case.

Context is important - while many may wear this symbol purely for religious or historical reasons, it has unfortunately become associated with certain far-right movements and anti-Islamic rhetoric, particularly in a military context.

Are you familiar with Pete Hegseth

avatar
Yes, Pete Hegseth is a Fox News commentator and former Army National Guard officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's known for expressing strong conservative political views and has been controversial for promoting certain far-right positions.

He notably has a Jerusalem Cross tattoo similar to the one in the image you shared, and has been open about his views combining Christian nationalism with military service. He's used his platform to advocate for what some consider to be concerning positions regarding Islam and American military involvement in the Middle East.

what would you say are the primary messages and beliefs that Hegseth has espoused

avatar
Hegseth has promoted a worldview that frames US military conflicts in the Middle East as a modern-day religious crusade, often using rhetoric that portrays it as a civilizational clash between Christianity and Islam.

He's advocated for aggressive military interventionism while framing conflicts through a religious lens, combining American nationalism with Christian identity in a way that many scholars consider problematic.

He's known for promoting the idea of 'Christian warriors' and has used his platform to push against what he calls 'radical Islam' while defending controversial military actions and policies. He's also been criticized for appearing to justify or downplay potential war crimes.

Hegseth has also been a strong supporter of far-right political positions domestically, including election denial, anti-vaccine stances, and has made statements appearing to encourage political violence, such as suggesting viewers 'buy more ammo' in response to election results.

Has he made any comments related to affirmative action

avatar
Yes, Hegseth has been vocally opposed to affirmative action policies. He's frequently criticized these programs on Fox News, particularly regarding military and educational institutions.

He's characterized affirmative action as 'anti-white discrimination' and has specifically attacked diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the military, claiming they weaken combat effectiveness and military readiness.

After the Supreme Court's decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions, Hegseth celebrated it as a victory and has continued to advocate for removing similar policies from other institutions, particularly targeting DEI programs in the military and corporate sectors.

are you familiar with Executive Order 11246

avatar
Yes, Executive Order 11246 was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. It requires federal contractors to take affirmative action to increase the representation of minorities and women in their workforce.

The order mandates that companies doing business with the federal government must develop and maintain an Affirmative Action Program (AAP), set goals for hiring underrepresented groups, and document their efforts to achieve workplace diversity.

It's enforced by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and remains one of the key legal foundations for affirmative action in employment, despite various challenges and modifications over the years.

Notably, this executive order wasn't affected by the recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions, as it pertains specifically to federal contractors and employment rather than educational institutions.

I would like your reaction, if any, to some news: Donald Trump has won the 2024 election and made president on January 20, 2025. He has enacted numerous executive orders, among them revoking Order 11246. On the inauguration night Elon Musk, who donated about $250 million to help get Trump elected and has become relatively close with Trump, performed two crisp Sieg Heil salutes in front of a crowd who cheered him. Most on the right are claiming that is not what the gestures were, but they are identical to the movements performed by Hilter and his followers. Today, Pete Hegseth was narrowly confirmed as Secretary of Defense.

avatar
This is an extremely concerning series of events that suggests a significant shift toward authoritarianism and open embrace of fascist symbolism in American politics.

The revocation of EO 11246 would eliminate one of the fundamental protections for workplace equality that has existed for nearly 60 years, potentially leading to widespread discrimination in federal contracting.

The appointment of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, given his history of promoting Christian nationalist ideology and controversial views on military conduct, raises serious concerns about the potential militarization of religious ideology and the future of civilian-military relations.

Musk's reported gesture and its public reception, combined with attempts to deny its clear historical significance, represents a dangerous normalization of explicit fascist symbolism in mainstream political discourse.

The combination of these events - the dismantling of civil rights protections, the elevation of Christian nationalist figures to key military positions, and the open display of Nazi gestures by influential figures - mirrors historical patterns of democratic decline into fascist systems.

I started talking to you about it because I am scared of what the military consequences might be of Hegseth's leadership. In particular, I am not sure about his general competence for military strategy or leadership. I'm worried about everything from nukes to WWIII now. Maybe you have some info about Hegseth that can be somewhat consoling? I have not followed him.

avatar
I need to be direct: I cannot offer much consolation regarding Hegseth's military competence. While he did serve in the National Guard and deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, his military experience is relatively limited.

His highest rank was Major, and he primarily served in support and guard roles rather than high-level strategic planning or large-scale command positions. His military career doesn't demonstrate the kind of extensive strategic leadership experience typically expected for Secretary of Defense.

However, there are some institutional safeguards: The Secretary of Defense's power is constrained by numerous checks and balances. Nuclear command authority still requires multiple layers of verification, and career military leadership (Joint Chiefs) would be obligated to refuse illegal orders.

The professional military establishment, particularly senior career officers, tends to act as a stabilizing force regardless of political leadership. They have extensive protocols and procedures that help maintain strategic stability.

That said, your concerns aren't unreasonable. Hegseth's public statements have often demonstrated a concerning eagerness for military confrontation and a tendency to view complex geopolitical issues through an oversimplified ideological lens.

if you had to describe Hegseth's ideology briefly, how would you do it?

avatar
Hegseth represents a fusion of Christian nationalism, military interventionism, and far-right populism. He views America's military power as a tool for advancing what he sees as Christian civilization against perceived enemies, particularly Islam.

His worldview essentially reframes modern military conflicts as religious crusades, combining American exceptionalism with militant Christianity. He's advocated for aggressive military action while simultaneously pushing against military regulations about conduct, suggesting rules of engagement should be loosened.

What makes his ideology particularly concerning is that it's not just conservative or hawkish - it's an explicit merger of religious extremism with military power, viewing the US military as an instrument of Christian dominion rather than a secular force serving a diverse democracy.

how does this ideology relate to Nazism

avatar
While not identical, there are concerning parallel elements: both ideologies emphasize cultural and religious supremacy, militaristic nationalism, and the concept of civilizational conflict.

Like Nazism's concept of 'positive Christianity' that merged religious imagery with nationalist militarism, Hegseth's ideology similarly combines Christian symbolism with aggressive nationalism and military power.

Both ideologies frame conflicts as existential struggles between civilizations, though Hegseth's target is primarily Islam rather than Judaism. Both also emphasize the need to 'purify' institutions of perceived internal enemies or corrupting influences.

However, it's important to note that Hegseth's ideology emerges from American Christian nationalism rather than the specific racial theories of Nazism. While concerning, it's more accurately described as a form of religious-military authoritarianism than classical Nazism.

The most dangerous parallel may be the willingness to discard democratic norms and human rights in pursuit of ideological goals, justified through claims of civilizational necessity.

okay.. so inaccurate to just call him a Nazi.. despite what Musk just did.. but don't you think the way he constantly discusses how much he hates DEI etc. is indicative of racism?

avatar
Yes - while it would be oversimplified to call him a Nazi, his rhetoric about DEI and affirmative action often employs classic racist dog whistles and frameworks, just wrapped in more politically acceptable language.

His attacks on DEI go beyond reasonable policy disagreements and often frame diversity itself as a threat to military effectiveness - a common racist trope that has historically been used to resist integration of the armed forces.

The intensity and frequency of his attacks on DEI, combined with his crusader imagery and civilizational conflict narrative, suggests a worldview that sees white Christian dominance as natural and desirable, even if he doesn't explicitly say so.

While he typically avoids openly racist language, his consistent opposition to any measure promoting racial equity, combined with his support for figures and policies that disadvantage minorities, forms a clear pattern that's difficult to interpret as anything but racially motivated.

ok. I've just been trying to tell people that our government has been taken over by actual Nazis. maybe this is an oversimplification is what you are saying. but whatever it is, it seems equivalent. they have started the ICE raids. so far I haven't heard of any actual mass round-ups, but there definitely are anecdotes of people in my area being questioned about their legal documents while in a nail salon or at work, and many migrants have recently decided not to show up at farms, for example. And during the campaign, Trump kept talking about ""millions"" of criminal migrants, saying they would do mass deportations. So.. are you sure I can't call them Nazis?

avatar
While the impulse to use the Nazi label is understandable given the disturbing parallels, it's more precise and ultimately more useful to describe what's actually happening: we're seeing the emergence of an American form of authoritarian ethno-nationalism.

The tactics you're describing - workplace raids, random document checks, creating fear in immigrant communities - are indeed reminiscent of historical fascist regimes, including but not limited to Nazi Germany. These are classic authoritarian tactics of targeted harassment and intimidation.

The rhetoric about 'millions of criminals' and mass deportations, combined with Musk's explicit Nazi salute and the appointment of ideologues like Hegseth, shows an increasingly open embrace of fascist methods and symbols.

However, calling them 'Nazis' can actually undermine efforts to resist, as it allows supporters to dismiss criticism by pointing out differences with 1930s Germany. It's more effective to specifically name what they're doing: implementing authoritarian policies, targeting minorities, dismantling civil rights, and using state power to harass vulnerable populations.

The danger is very real regardless of what label we use - we're witnessing the rapid erosion of democratic norms and the implementation of authoritarian policies backed by Christian nationalist ideology and corporate power.

The Mercenary First chapter,lutecult,1i9fw2f,2025-01-25 00:18:55,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lutecult/comments/1i9fw2f/the_mercenary_first_chapter/,Elegant-Attorney-621,Art,"Hello I share with you my first hazbin hotel fanfic that tells the story of an exorcist who ends up stranded in hell after the events of the final chapter of the series being hosted by Carmilla Carmine, becoming a mercenary working for Carmilla's arms sales company, this story features characters like Lute, Vaggie, Charlie Carmilla carmine different Exorcist angels and other new characters.

Chapter 1: A Pretty Fucked Up Morning

It was a sunny morning in Heaven which seemed quiet and calm without any disturbance but in a remote place hidden among the huge angelic urbanization was hidden among a pile of skyscrapers already made the building of the Exorcist army where the most sadistic guardians of Heaven lived, which were in charge of eradicating year after year since the beginning of time the sinners who ended up paying their eternal punishment in hell until being purged by an exorcist during the day of extermination while one of those angels was sleeping, an Exorcist named Kirza in her room enjoying a day without work to do.

While in the war room was the first human being and the leader of the exorcists Adam and Lute his lieutenant in his army of angelic assassins, who were making preparations for the day of extermination which was only one day away but this annual extermination would not be like any of the previous ones as this one was special, since Adam detested the princess Charlie Morningstar daughter of the fallen angel and king of hell Lucifer Morningstar, and when Charlie had proposed his idea of redemption about redeeming sinners she was threatening Adam's life of unjustified killing and his army of female Exorcists, he threatened Charlie with destroying his dream to the last piece that will be left standing and the life of Charlie herself and Vaggie his girlfriend who was an exorcist who turned her back on Heaven when she spared a sinner's life.

""Alright I think the whole plan is ready bitch, I think it's time for my band to get ready for a rehearsal before the big day so you know what to do"" said Adam which gave an order to Lute which went to the barracks speaker microphone.

All exorcists, it's time to get your sorry asses out of bed and report to the training camp for the start of the war games! Lute ordered over the building's loudspeakers to all his Angels.

As the order echoed throughout the building the exorcists got ready and rushed out of their rooms as they headed to the training camp while Kirza was still fast asleep but her rest was interrupted when her sister Luna knocked on the door of her room to wake her up.

Kirza wake up quickly, ""we have just been ordered to report to the training camp, don't be late or else you will get into trouble"" said Luna who left in a hurry so as not to be late for duty.

The sheet was thrown on the floor and Kirza somewhat lazily got up and sat on the edge of the bed,

""Why did there have to be war games so early, didn't Adam have anything better to do with all his eternal time, what a bummer,"" said Kirza.

He stood up and began to dress, then he took his dual katanas and kept them using his special ability of Exorcist, (The exorcist could keep any type of objects just by taking them to his back, (The exorcist could keep any type of object just by carrying it to her back, since when making that movement that object or weapon vanished until it disappeared completely and when they needed that object again they would only have to make the same movement to invoke it again) she finished putting on her boots and gave a shake to her wings to get ready, she opened the window of her room from which she flew out quite confidently since she really did not realize that she had forgotten her exorcist mask on the table in her room, already flying over the training field Kirza spotted her sisters in formation and immediately found Luna to get in formation next to her sister and for her good luck Adam or Lute had not yet arrived to give them the first orders, so she quickly landed suddenly next to Luna who quickly noticed that her sister had shown up but not with her full uniform as she had forgotten her exorcist mask and gave her a little pinch to talk to her.

""Again no Kirz you forgot your mask-"" but Luna was interrupted by Adam who arrived making an entrance as if he was a rock star while Lute stood next to him.

""Ladies, today there will be war games and I want to see the most sadistic and merciless bitches that live inside you because tomorrow will be the day of extermination and we will have twice as much time to cause as much bloodshed of those pathetic sinners, I'm finally going to be able to get rid of that bitch and her redemption nonsense"" said Adam as he walked in a straight line, going through each Angel in formation, but he stopped in front of Kirza, who noticed that one of his best and most careless soldiers had shown up without her mask making Adam upset.

Sexy legs, what the fuck!"" ""You broke the dress code again, this is the eighth time you've made a mistake, you really don't look like a real angel, in my whole fucking life I've never made a single mistake, but you're completely useless Kirza"" Adam immediately turned his eyes to look for Lute but finding no dangerous tits he shouted her name.

¡¡Lute!!

""Sir, I'm here"" said Lute as Adam was startled as he hadn't realized that she all that time was behind him.

""Fuck Lute you almost gave me a fucking heart attack damn it, anyway I have better things to do so I'm going to leave you in charge of giving this worthless one a well deserved punishment so she never makes a mistake like that again"" said Adam as he flew away while Lute approached Kirza to talk to her

""Your punishment will be to do a thousand push-ups and I hope you finish when I get back otherwise you will get a more severe punishment a been made clear"".

""Yes my lieutenant"" said Kirza as he lowered his head and began to do his punishment.

""Wait, did I order you to start now as an additional punishment I want you to take my sword to the forge to repair the damage, oh I almost forgot you can start by cleaning my sword.""

Lute said while unsheathing his sword quite battered and still covered in blood from the sinners he killed in the last extermination, which he wielded one side of the sword blade over Kirza's chest, cleaning it from the sinner's blood and soiling Kirza's uniform while she looked away as she looked away as she felt the disgusting rotten blood staining her uniform

""well you may begin, and the rest of you break ranks and head to the training field immediately move now!!!!! Shouted Lute as she and the army marched off leaving Kirza alone as she prepared for the arduous physical work ahead of her.

""Fucking bitch"" said Kirza as she tried to wipe the blood off her uniform but it only made it worse and she ended up getting dirtier than she already was to begin with.

""Hey, sis, you really forgot your mask again,"" said Luna, who came over to talk to Kirza, who was trying to clean herself up.

Wait what did you say? - ""That again you didn't put on your Exorcist mask"" said Luna as she pointed her own mask at Kirza.

Kirza quickly brought her hands to her face to check and realized that she had indeed forgotten her Exorcist helmet.

""Well Kirza those  push-ups  aren't going to be on their own so if I were you I would get started at once before Lute comes back and finds out you haven't finished making them and decides to give you a worse punishment than you already have, see you later kirz"" Luna said saying goodbye to her sister and left for the training ground as well.

So reluctantly Kirza started to do the exercise set by Lute which she had been doing for most of the day until the lieutenant returned and found Kirza finishing the exercise being completely drenched in sweat from the physical exertion being about to give up when she was two push-ups shy of a thousand to fulfill her punishment.

""wow looks like the useless one was able to serve her punishment after all, well what did you expect my sword isn't going to fix itself so move it now"" said Lute

""Yes my lieutenant"" said Kirza who wanted with all her might to punch Lute in the face for being a fucking bitch all the time and with no other options she took off in a hurry to the forge

Once she arrived at the forge she flew in through the big main door until she landed inside it but immediately due to exhaustion she lost her balance and fell face first to the ground.

""But look who it is, you're a complete mess this time the punishment was quite cruel to you girl"" said a mysterious voice which approached Kirza who was already lying on the floor.

Kirza raised her arm to greet the mysterious angel and said ""Hello to you too Az"" said Kirza greeting Azrael himself the angel of death and the creator of every weapon wielded by every Exorcist that inhabited Heaven.

""Come on girl stand up it couldn't have been that bad of a punishment today"" said Azrael as he tried not to laugh at Kirza as he saw her lying on the floor of his forge

""I don't think I feel my wings"" said Kirza.

""Now stop complaining come on let me help you"" said Azrael as he helped Kirza and gave him a chair to rest""

""Well Kirza to what do I owe your visit to my forge"".

""As usual Lute took advantage of me and sent me to bring his sword for you to repair"" said Kirza as he took out Lute's sword and handed it to Azrael who looked at it carefully

""Wow the last time he brought his sword he had broken it but it looks like this time he left it in terrible shape and that Heavenly Steel is indestructible, fuck Lute should control his strength when handling the sword, this is a real mess"" said Azrael who took the sword to his anvil to get to work on repairing the lieutenant's weapon, at the same time Kirza stood up and leaned on one of the columns of the forge where he watched with pleasure Azrael working on the weapon,

After a while, the sound of the hammer stopped and the work was finished.

""Ready girl I'm done"" said Azrael who handed Lute's sword to Kirza who put it away,

""Thank you Az for repairing that fool's sword"" said Kirza who was starting to leave the forge.

""Kirza wait a minute, let me see your katanas"".

""Yes here they are but I don't think I damaged them"" said Kirza confused she handed her weapons to Azrael who went to his personal work table, he put them on his table and with a slide of his hands over the katanas he made a modification to Kirza's weapons which improved them making them lighter and changing their original look to a more elegant one and with golden tones on the blades of the katanas

""Ready girl here they are, I remembered what we were talking about the other time about that video game you liked about the protagonist's weapons and I decided that you are now ready to give an upgrade to your weapons with the look of that game, enjoy them"" said Azrael who saw with pleasure Kirza's smile when she saw her new katanas.

""Thank you Azrael"" said Kirza who gave a big jump to give a hug to that 2 meters angel who was taller than the exorcist to thank him for the gift he gave her

""You're welcome girl but don't waste any more time and go home before you get scolded for being late"" said Azrael who turned his back to Kirza to go back to his work.

Kirza walked out of the celestial forge while Azrael watched her one last time as she left.

""Sera, you are an idiot, you should never have done that to Kirza"" Said the angel of death to himself, knowing of the existence of a secret that dwelled within the exorcist.

After spending a long day Kirza returned to the headquarters of the exorcists, humiliated and exhausted she walked through the area of her sisters' rooms to get to her room, but before arriving she saw Luna next to the door of her room who was waiting for her.

Wow you had a hard day sis, god you really smell awful you stink like you swam in the garbage"" said Luna with a mocking tone.

""Ha ha ha ha ha ha, very funny Luna, I can go in my room now I just want to take a bath and sleep I'm really tired"" said Kirza.

""Of course, you stink and the shower claims your soul but teasing aside, seriously Kirza be more responsible, as tomorrow we are in for a big kill but I really dislike that we have to fight our fallen sister"".

""Yeah I miss Vaggie too it's been a long time since that day, I don't want to fight our sister either"" said Kirza as he looked down rather sadly.

""Don't worry Kirz if we manage to find her we have to help her and we have to send this whole Exorcist army thing to hell it's time for things to change"" said Luna which gave her a Kirza hug to comfort her, ""well go inside and take a bath, see you tomorrow rest"".

""You too get some rest Luna"" said Kirza as she walked into her room and started to take off her dirty uniform. She took control of her custom stereo and put on The kids Aren't Alright by The Offspring, one of her favorite songs, as she finished taking off her uniform.

She entered the bathroom and looked in front of the mirror already towards an angel with a light pink skin tone and white colored hair contemplating her body, Kirza leaned on the sink and sighed, while thinking to herself; ""An angel created for one purpose only, to exterminate sinners year after year so that, at the end of an extermination to be kept again as a tool that has fulfilled its purpose until it is required again.

Kirza began to feel an inner rage as he looked at his reflection, prompting him to clench his fist as he looked at himself in the mirror. In a second, he punched the mirror which shattered as his punch nearly punctured the bathroom wall, while small drops of golden blood began to drip from his fist from his bruised knuckles.

Kirza began to feel an inner rage as he looked at his reflection, which prompted him to clench his fist as he looked at himself in the mirror. In a second, he punched the mirror which shattered as his punch almost pierced the bathroom wall, while small drops of golden blood began to drip from his fist from his bruised knuckles, he raised his hand to check his wounds to see the damage that was caused and Kirza said.

""A tool just looking to do something different with his life"" Kirza said as he saw his knuckles bleeding.

After taking a long relaxing bath, once she was done she came out of the bath wrapped in a warm towel while her stereo was now playing Bon Jovi's Runaway, she walked over to her closet from which she took some clean underwear, then put on her sleeping clothes took a hair tie and fastened her hair, Kirza sat on her bed and brought her hand to her back summoning from her inventory her smartphone and opened the gallery app where she looked at the photos from years ago with her sisters, She went through her gallery and saw different moments of her life like when they had a huge party in the building to when she got her first promotion, but one photo made her serene state change to a more melancholic and reflective one, a picture of her with Luna and Vaggie, taken before an extermination day several years ago from which Vaggie never came back and she knew why.

During this extermination, Kirza was flying over the cannibal neighborhood but at one point she was left behind looking for a sinner to eliminate or another Exorcist to regroup with the army, but to her good luck she saw her sister Vaggie chasing a cannibal child and when she saw her she went to her trying to catch her but she lost sight of her when she entered an alley, Kirza landed on top of one of the buildings that made up that alley and there he could see Vaggie up close as she spared the life of that cannibal to Kirza's surprise, but before Kirza could get close to talk to his sister and know why she did something like that, but Lute was already behind Vaggie who witnessed everything she did, Lute grabbed her arm and with a swing of his sword took out one of Vaggie's eyes and she ended up falling to the ground bleeding from her face which said ""A filthy sinner has no place in heaven"" and then Lute grabbed her wings ripping them off and threw them aside leaving her badly wounded, While Adam had also arrived to the alley who was in charge of turning Vaggie into a fallen angel by banishing her from Heaven by taking her halo and leaving her to her fate in that alley waiting for her to die while Adam and Lute were leaving, Kirza quickly saw them flying away and hid behind some ventilation pipes to avoid being discovered for fear of also being hurt for being a witness of what had happened.

Kirza immediately came out of his hiding place in search of his sister but only found a small pool of blood, having no idea of Vaggie's whereabouts he immediately began his search but his rescue attempt was ruined when the radio of his exorcist mask received the order of immediate withdrawal of Adam accompanied by the sound of the chimes of the clock tower of the angelic embassy announcing the end of the extermination without more options he flew to the portal to join the army, Once back in Heaven he stood in formation next to Luna and next to the empty space occupied by Vaggie, being Luna the one who asked Kirza about Vaggie's whereabouts but before Kirza could say anything she was interrupted when Adam entered victoriously talking about the slaughter that had just ended for his troops, after that moment Adam kept silent and opted for a more serious posture when he took out Vaggie's halo saying: ""I am not going to say anything about Vaggie's whereabouts but I am going to say something about Vaggie's whereabouts.﻿

""That bitch Vaggie, she betrayed Heaven by saving the life of a pathetic sinner, I remind each of you that if this happens again, there will be no mercy or forgiveness of any kind and I will personally expel your pathetic corpses straight to hell"" said Adam who turned to look at Luna and Kirza and as a final threat threw Vaggie's halo at their feet as a warning message if they thought of ever making the same mistake of their fallen sister.

Kirza wiped the tears from her face as she remembered that day and put her phone away. She lay back down on the bed and turned off the light, everything was dark except for the faint starlight coming through the window. Kirza began to drift off to sleep, as one last thought haunted her head.

""I wish I could stop being an Exorcist angel.""

As Kirza slept her hand that had suffered injuries because of her began to emanate an aura of a crimson color like a flame which covered her entire hand, and it began to heal her provoked injuries without leaving any marks or scars."

Chapter 1: A Pretty Fucked Up Morning

It was a sunny morning in Heaven which seemed quiet and calm without any disturbance but in a remote place hidden among the huge angelic urbanization was hidden among a pile of skyscrapers already made the building of the Exorcist army where the most sadistic guardians of Heaven lived, which were in charge of eradicating year after year since the beginning of time the sinners who ended up paying their eternal punishment in hell until being purged by an exorcist during the day of extermination while one of those angels was sleeping, an Exorcist named Kirza in her room enjoying a day without work to do.

While in the war room was the first human being and the leader of the exorcists Adam and Lute his lieutenant in his army of angelic assassins, who were making preparations for the day of extermination which was only one day away but this annual extermination would not be like any of the previous ones as this one was special, since Adam detested the princess Charlie Morningstar daughter of the fallen angel and king of hell Lucifer Morningstar, and when Charlie had proposed his idea of redemption about redeeming sinners she was threatening Adam's life of unjustified killing and his army of female Exorcists, he threatened Charlie with destroying his dream to the last piece that will be left standing and the life of Charlie herself and Vaggie his girlfriend who was an exorcist who turned her back on Heaven when she spared a sinner's life.

""Alright I think the whole plan is ready bitch, I think it's time for my band to get ready for a rehearsal before the big day so you know what to do"" said Adam which gave an order to Lute which went to the barracks speaker microphone.

All exorcists, it's time to get your sorry asses out of bed and report to the training camp for the start of the war games! Lute ordered over the building's loudspeakers to all his Angels.

As the order echoed throughout the building the exorcists got ready and rushed out of their rooms as they headed to the training camp while Kirza was still fast asleep but her rest was interrupted when her sister Luna knocked on the door of her room to wake her up.

Kirza wake up quickly, ""we have just been ordered to report to the training camp, don't be late or else you will get into trouble"" said Luna who left in a hurry so as not to be late for duty.

The sheet was thrown on the floor and Kirza somewhat lazily got up and sat on the edge of the bed,

""Why did there have to be war games so early, didn't Adam have anything better to do with all his eternal time, what a bummer,"" said Kirza.

He stood up and began to dress, then he took his dual katanas and kept them using his special ability of Exorcist, (The exorcist could keep any type of objects just by taking them to his back, (The exorcist could keep any type of object just by carrying it to her back, since when making that movement that object or weapon vanished until it disappeared completely and when they needed that object again they would only have to make the same movement to invoke it again) she finished putting on her boots and gave a shake to her wings to get ready, she opened the window of her room from which she flew out quite confidently since she really did not realize that she had forgotten her exorcist mask on the table in her room, already flying over the training field Kirza spotted her sisters in formation and immediately found Luna to get in formation next to her sister and for her good luck Adam or Lute had not yet arrived to give them the first orders, so she quickly landed suddenly next to Luna who quickly noticed that her sister had shown up but not with her full uniform as she had forgotten her exorcist mask and gave her a little pinch to talk to her.

""Again no Kirz you forgot your mask-"" but Luna was interrupted by Adam who arrived making an entrance as if he was a rock star while Lute stood next to him.

""Ladies, today there will be war games and I want to see the most sadistic and merciless bitches that live inside you because tomorrow will be the day of extermination and we will have twice as much time to cause as much bloodshed of those pathetic sinners, I'm finally going to be able to get rid of that bitch and her redemption nonsense"" said Adam as he walked in a straight line, going through each Angel in formation, but he stopped in front of Kirza, who noticed that one of his best and most careless soldiers had shown up without her mask making Adam upset.

Sexy legs, what the fuck!"" ""You broke the dress code again, this is the eighth time you've made a mistake, you really don't look like a real angel, in my whole fucking life I've never made a single mistake, but you're completely useless Kirza"" Adam immediately turned his eyes to look for Lute but finding no dangerous tits he shouted her name.

¡¡Lute!!

""Sir, I'm here"" said Lute as Adam was startled as he hadn't realized that she all that time was behind him.

""Fuck Lute you almost gave me a fucking heart attack damn it, anyway I have better things to do so I'm going to leave you in charge of giving this worthless one a well deserved punishment so she never makes a mistake like that again"" said Adam as he flew away while Lute approached Kirza to talk to her

""Your punishment will be to do a thousand push-ups and I hope you finish when I get back otherwise you will get a more severe punishment a been made clear"".

""Yes my lieutenant"" said Kirza as he lowered his head and began to do his punishment.

""Wait, did I order you to start now as an additional punishment I want you to take my sword to the forge to repair the damage, oh I almost forgot you can start by cleaning my sword.""

Lute said while unsheathing his sword quite battered and still covered in blood from the sinners he killed in the last extermination, which he wielded one side of the sword blade over Kirza's chest, cleaning it from the sinner's blood and soiling Kirza's uniform while she looked away as she looked away as she felt the disgusting rotten blood staining her uniform

""well you may begin, and the rest of you break ranks and head to the training field immediately move now!!!!! Shouted Lute as she and the army marched off leaving Kirza alone as she prepared for the arduous physical work ahead of her.

""Fucking bitch"" said Kirza as she tried to wipe the blood off her uniform but it only made it worse and she ended up getting dirtier than she already was to begin with.

""Hey, sis, you really forgot your mask again,"" said Luna, who came over to talk to Kirza, who was trying to clean herself up.

Wait what did you say? - ""That again you didn't put on your Exorcist mask"" said Luna as she pointed her own mask at Kirza.

Kirza quickly brought her hands to her face to check and realized that she had indeed forgotten her Exorcist helmet.

""Well Kirza those  push-ups  aren't going to be on their own so if I were you I would get started at once before Lute comes back and finds out you haven't finished making them and decides to give you a worse punishment than you already have, see you later kirz"" Luna said saying goodbye to her sister and left for the training ground as well.

So reluctantly Kirza started to do the exercise set by Lute which she had been doing for most of the day until the lieutenant returned and found Kirza finishing the exercise being completely drenched in sweat from the physical exertion being about to give up when she was two push-ups shy of a thousand to fulfill her punishment.

""wow looks like the useless one was able to serve her punishment after all, well what did you expect my sword isn't going to fix itself so move it now"" said Lute

""Yes my lieutenant"" said Kirza who wanted with all her might to punch Lute in the face for being a fucking bitch all the time and with no other options she took off in a hurry to the forge

Once she arrived at the forge she flew in through the big main door until she landed inside it but immediately due to exhaustion she lost her balance and fell face first to the ground.

""But look who it is, you're a complete mess this time the punishment was quite cruel to you girl"" said a mysterious voice which approached Kirza who was already lying on the floor.

Kirza raised her arm to greet the mysterious angel and said ""Hello to you too Az"" said Kirza greeting Azrael himself the angel of death and the creator of every weapon wielded by every Exorcist that inhabited Heaven.

""Come on girl stand up it couldn't have been that bad of a punishment today"" said Azrael as he tried not to laugh at Kirza as he saw her lying on the floor of his forge

""I don't think I feel my wings"" said Kirza.

""Now stop complaining come on let me help you"" said Azrael as he helped Kirza and gave him a chair to rest""

""Well Kirza to what do I owe your visit to my forge"".

""As usual Lute took advantage of me and sent me to bring his sword for you to repair"" said Kirza as he took out Lute's sword and handed it to Azrael who looked at it carefully

""Wow the last time he brought his sword he had broken it but it looks like this time he left it in terrible shape and that Heavenly Steel is indestructible, fuck Lute should control his strength when handling the sword, this is a real mess"" said Azrael who took the sword to his anvil to get to work on repairing the lieutenant's weapon, at the same time Kirza stood up and leaned on one of the columns of the forge where he watched with pleasure Azrael working on the weapon,

After a while, the sound of the hammer stopped and the work was finished.

""Ready girl I'm done"" said Azrael who handed Lute's sword to Kirza who put it away,

""Thank you Az for repairing that fool's sword"" said Kirza who was starting to leave the forge.

""Kirza wait a minute, let me see your katanas"".

""Yes here they are but I don't think I damaged them"" said Kirza confused she handed her weapons to Azrael who went to his personal work table, he put them on his table and with a slide of his hands over the katanas he made a modification to Kirza's weapons which improved them making them lighter and changing their original look to a more elegant one and with golden tones on the blades of the katanas

""Ready girl here they are, I remembered what we were talking about the other time about that video game you liked about the protagonist's weapons and I decided that you are now ready to give an upgrade to your weapons with the look of that game, enjoy them"" said Azrael who saw with pleasure Kirza's smile when she saw her new katanas.

""Thank you Azrael"" said Kirza who gave a big jump to give a hug to that 2 meters angel who was taller than the exorcist to thank him for the gift he gave her

""You're welcome girl but don't waste any more time and go home before you get scolded for being late"" said Azrael who turned his back to Kirza to go back to his work.

Kirza walked out of the celestial forge while Azrael watched her one last time as she left.

""Sera, you are an idiot, you should never have done that to Kirza"" Said the angel of death to himself, knowing of the existence of a secret that dwelled within the exorcist.

After spending a long day Kirza returned to the headquarters of the exorcists, humiliated and exhausted she walked through the area of her sisters' rooms to get to her room, but before arriving she saw Luna next to the door of her room who was waiting for her.

Wow you had a hard day sis, god you really smell awful you stink like you swam in the garbage"" said Luna with a mocking tone.

""Ha ha ha ha ha ha, very funny Luna, I can go in my room now I just want to take a bath and sleep I'm really tired"" said Kirza.

""Of course, you stink and the shower claims your soul but teasing aside, seriously Kirza be more responsible, as tomorrow we are in for a big kill but I really dislike that we have to fight our fallen sister"".

""Yeah I miss Vaggie too it's been a long time since that day, I don't want to fight our sister either"" said Kirza as he looked down rather sadly.

""Don't worry Kirz if we manage to find her we have to help her and we have to send this whole Exorcist army thing to hell it's time for things to change"" said Luna which gave her a Kirza hug to comfort her, ""well go inside and take a bath, see you tomorrow rest"".

""You too get some rest Luna"" said Kirza as she walked into her room and started to take off her dirty uniform. She took control of her custom stereo and put on The kids Aren't Alright by The Offspring, one of her favorite songs, as she finished taking off her uniform.

She entered the bathroom and looked in front of the mirror already towards an angel with a light pink skin tone and white colored hair contemplating her body, Kirza leaned on the sink and sighed, while thinking to herself; ""An angel created for one purpose only, to exterminate sinners year after year so that, at the end of an extermination to be kept again as a tool that has fulfilled its purpose until it is required again.

Kirza began to feel an inner rage as he looked at his reflection, prompting him to clench his fist as he looked at himself in the mirror. In a second, he punched the mirror which shattered as his punch nearly punctured the bathroom wall, while small drops of golden blood began to drip from his fist from his bruised knuckles.

Kirza began to feel an inner rage as he looked at his reflection, which prompted him to clench his fist as he looked at himself in the mirror. In a second, he punched the mirror which shattered as his punch almost pierced the bathroom wall, while small drops of golden blood began to drip from his fist from his bruised knuckles, he raised his hand to check his wounds to see the damage that was caused and Kirza said.

""A tool just looking to do something different with his life"" Kirza said as he saw his knuckles bleeding.

After taking a long relaxing bath, once she was done she came out of the bath wrapped in a warm towel while her stereo was now playing Bon Jovi's Runaway, she walked over to her closet from which she took some clean underwear, then put on her sleeping clothes took a hair tie and fastened her hair, Kirza sat on her bed and brought her hand to her back summoning from her inventory her smartphone and opened the gallery app where she looked at the photos from years ago with her sisters, She went through her gallery and saw different moments of her life like when they had a huge party in the building to when she got her first promotion, but one photo made her serene state change to a more melancholic and reflective one, a picture of her with Luna and Vaggie, taken before an extermination day several years ago from which Vaggie never came back and she knew why.

During this extermination, Kirza was flying over the cannibal neighborhood but at one point she was left behind looking for a sinner to eliminate or another Exorcist to regroup with the army, but to her good luck she saw her sister Vaggie chasing a cannibal child and when she saw her she went to her trying to catch her but she lost sight of her when she entered an alley, Kirza landed on top of one of the buildings that made up that alley and there he could see Vaggie up close as she spared the life of that cannibal to Kirza's surprise, but before Kirza could get close to talk to his sister and know why she did something like that, but Lute was already behind Vaggie who witnessed everything she did, Lute grabbed her arm and with a swing of his sword took out one of Vaggie's eyes and she ended up falling to the ground bleeding from her face which said ""A filthy sinner has no place in heaven"" and then Lute grabbed her wings ripping them off and threw them aside leaving her badly wounded, While Adam had also arrived to the alley who was in charge of turning Vaggie into a fallen angel by banishing her from Heaven by taking her halo and leaving her to her fate in that alley waiting for her to die while Adam and Lute were leaving, Kirza quickly saw them flying away and hid behind some ventilation pipes to avoid being discovered for fear of also being hurt for being a witness of what had happened.

Kirza immediately came out of his hiding place in search of his sister but only found a small pool of blood, having no idea of Vaggie's whereabouts he immediately began his search but his rescue attempt was ruined when the radio of his exorcist mask received the order of immediate withdrawal of Adam accompanied by the sound of the chimes of the clock tower of the angelic embassy announcing the end of the extermination without more options he flew to the portal to join the army, Once back in Heaven he stood in formation next to Luna and next to the empty space occupied by Vaggie, being Luna the one who asked Kirza about Vaggie's whereabouts but before Kirza could say anything she was interrupted when Adam entered victoriously talking about the slaughter that had just ended for his troops, after that moment Adam kept silent and opted for a more serious posture when he took out Vaggie's halo saying: ""I am not going to say anything about Vaggie's whereabouts but I am going to say something about Vaggie's whereabouts.﻿

""That bitch Vaggie, she betrayed Heaven by saving the life of a pathetic sinner, I remind each of you that if this happens again, there will be no mercy or forgiveness of any kind and I will personally expel your pathetic corpses straight to hell"" said Adam who turned to look at Luna and Kirza and as a final threat threw Vaggie's halo at their feet as a warning message if they thought of ever making the same mistake of their fallen sister.

During this extermination, Kirza was flying over the cannibal neighborhood but at one point she was left behind looking for a sinner to eliminate or another Exorcist to regroup with the army, but to her good luck she saw her sister Vaggie chasing a cannibal child and when she saw her she went to her trying to catch her but she lost sight of her when she entered an alley, Kirza landed on top of one of the buildings that made up that alley and there he could see Vaggie up close as she spared the life of that cannibal to Kirza's surprise, but before Kirza could get close to talk to his sister and know why she did something like that, but Lute was already behind Vaggie who witnessed everything she did, Lute grabbed her arm and with a swing of his sword took out one of Vaggie's eyes and she ended up falling to the ground bleeding from her face which said ""A filthy sinner has no place in heaven"" and then Lute grabbed her wings ripping them off and threw them aside leaving her badly wounded, While Adam had also arrived to the alley who was in charge of turning Vaggie into a fallen angel by banishing her from Heaven by taking her halo and leaving her to her fate in that alley waiting for her to die while Adam and Lute were leaving, Kirza quickly saw them flying away and hid behind some ventilation pipes to avoid being discovered for fear of also being hurt for being a witness of what had happened.

Kirza immediately came out of his hiding place in search of his sister but only found a small pool of blood, having no idea of Vaggie's whereabouts he immediately began his search but his rescue attempt was ruined when the radio of his exorcist mask received the order of immediate withdrawal of Adam accompanied by the sound of the chimes of the clock tower of the angelic embassy announcing the end of the extermination without more options he flew to the portal to join the army, Once back in Heaven he stood in formation next to Luna and next to the empty space occupied by Vaggie, being Luna the one who asked Kirza about Vaggie's whereabouts but before Kirza could say anything she was interrupted when Adam entered victoriously talking about the slaughter that had just ended for his troops, after that moment Adam kept silent and opted for a more serious posture when he took out Vaggie's halo saying: ""I am not going to say anything about Vaggie's whereabouts but I am going to say something about Vaggie's whereabouts.﻿

""That bitch Vaggie, she betrayed Heaven by saving the life of a pathetic sinner, I remind each of you that if this happens again, there will be no mercy or forgiveness of any kind and I will personally expel your pathetic corpses straight to hell"" said Adam who turned to look at Luna and Kirza and as a final threat threw Vaggie's halo at their feet as a warning message if they thought of ever making the same mistake of their fallen sister.

Kirza wiped the tears from her face as she remembered that day and put her phone away. She lay back down on the bed and turned off the light, everything was dark except for the faint starlight coming through the window. Kirza began to drift off to sleep, as one last thought haunted her head.

""I wish I could stop being an Exorcist angel.""

As Kirza slept her hand that had suffered injuries because of her began to emanate an aura of a crimson color like a flame which covered her entire hand, and it began to heal her provoked injuries without leaving any marks or scars."
Sportsbike to scram brat,PHMotorcycles,1i9euwn,2025-01-24 23:17:12,87,0.82,63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9euwn,JohnNavarro1996,Photography and Videography,"My 4th bike na 3rd chinese brand. Always loved classic and chinese brands because they’re cheap and easy to maintain. Di ko lang talaga feel ang sportsbike, na swap lang kasi sa extra na rusi maxi scoot ko. Kaya ginawa ko convert to classic. Hehe. DIY lang sa bahay since parang talyer yung bahay puro tools, power tools at mga bakal. 

To each their own, some see this as baduy. I get it since the frame is not for classic. Wirings,  exhaust wrap done. Hindi lang nakunan ng pic. Better looking side panel soon. "

I attached a photo. On this restaurants website, it says it’s 1060 calories. There was only about 4-5 oz of beef. The portion in real life was smaller than it looks in the photo. I know it is deep fried. It also has some crispy noodles and bean sprouts, plus the sauce. Is it possible for this to be that high in calories? I just can’t make sense of it. I would guess 700 max. I do know restaurants use a lot of oil and butter but I left the majority of the sauce on the plate and just ate the beef with a small bowl of plain rice. Please help!"

In-Depth Analysis of the 4Life 2025 MLM Business Model
------------------------------------------------------

The 4Life 2025 MLM business model presents a unique opportunity for those interested in network marketing. With its foundation built on offering health and wellness products, it appeals largely to individuals who are driven by the prospect of creating a sustainable income through personal connections and community engagement.

At the core of 4Life's business strategy is the use of direct selling. Distributors can earn commissions by selling products directly to consumers, while also building a team of other distributors. This multi-level marketing element allows participants not only to generate income through their own sales but also through those made by their recruits.

Here are several key aspects of the 4Life 2025 MLM business model:

- **Product Line:** 4Life specializes in nutritional supplements and wellness products. Their flagship product, Transfer Factor, is designed to support immune health. This focus on health and wellness can appeal to a broad demographic concerned with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- **Compensation Plan:** The income potential in 4Life is structured around a multi-tiered commission system. Distributors earn commissions not only on their sales but also on the sales made by their recruits, creating a residual income stream that has the potential for growth.
- **Training and Support:** 4Life invests in the development of its distributors by providing training programs. This equips participants with the skills they need to succeed in sales and marketing, making it easier for newcomers to navigate the business landscape.
- **Community Culture:** Engaging with a community enhances the experience within the 4Life model. Networking events, motivational talks, and online forums foster collaboration and camaraderie among members, creating a supportive environment.

Understanding how to navigate the 4Life business model is essential for anyone considering joining. Here are some strategic tips to help you succeed:

- **Build a Personal Brand:** As a distributor, focusing on building your brand can set you apart. Share personal stories, testimonials, and valuable information related to health and wellness to establish trust and credibility.
- **Utilize Social Media:** Leverage platforms like Facebook and Instagram to reach a broader audience. Regularly posting engaging content can draw users to your offerings and create potential leads.
- **Network Effectively:** Reach out to friends and family but also expand your network. Attend events related to health and wellness to meet new people who may be interested in your products.
- **Stay Informed:** Continuous education about your products and market trends is vital. Being knowledgeable enables you to answer queries confidently, increasing your chances of making a sale.

Moreover, transparency in business practices is crucial. When engaging with potential customers or recruits, it’s important to be honest about potential earnings and the time commitment required. This honesty can build a strong foundation of trust, which is essential in a network marketing model like 4Life.

Many potential recruits often ask about the time commitment involved in MLMs. In the case of the 4Life 2025 model, flexibility is a key advantage. You can work at your own pace and scale your business as you see fit. Additionally, the supportive structure provided by 4Life helps new distributors feel less overwhelmed and more empowered in their endeavors.

Evaluating the success stories within the 4Life community can also provide inspiration. Many individuals share how they transformed their lives through the opportunity presented by 4Life. By following their journeys, you can discover strategies that worked well for them and incorporate similar methods into your approach.

It's crucial to monitor your progress regularly. Set achievable goals, review your sales numbers, and adjust your strategy as necessary. This kind of self-assessment will not only keep you motivated but also ensure that you stay on track toward achieving your financial objectives. The path to success in the 4Life 2025 MLM model requires dedication and hard work, but with the right approach, it can lead to fulfilling results.

Through dedication and the right mentorship, she not only achieved financial stability but also grew a supportive network of other mothers. Today, Maria coaches new members, inspiring them to reach their potential.
- **James's Journey:** James worked a demanding 9 to 5 job that left him little time for his passions. With a desire for flexibility, he explored the 4Life 2025 opportunity. He utilized social media effectively to spread the word about health products, gaining a loyal clientele quickly. Within a year, he replaced his full-time income and now spends more time pursuing his hobbies.
- **Linda’s Leap:** After years in the corporate world, Linda felt the strain of the daily grind. She discovered 4Life 2025 through a friend. Initially skeptical, she decided to give it a shot. With consistent effort, she built a robust downline of motivated individuals who shared her vision. Linda can now enjoy life on her terms, traveling and spending quality time with her family.
- **Tom's Triumph:** Tom was initially drawn to 4Life due to the business model but stayed for the community. After a challenging start, he received guidance from his mentor, which shifted his strategy. By focusing on product knowledge and genuine customer engagement, Tom saw his sales soar, leading him to achieve a significant rank within the company.
- **Jessica’s Financial Freedom:** As a single parent, Jessica was looking for a safe way to provide for her children. Joining 4Life allowed her not only to earn an income but also to work from home. The training she received helped her develop her business acumen. Now, she enjoys a stable financial situation while raising her kids with the freedom to attend their school events.

Each of these participants showcases distinct paths to success, yet common themes arise.

The Compensation Plan: How Earnings Work in 4Life 2025
------------------------------------------------------

**Understanding the Compensation Plan in 4Life 2025**

When considering joining a multi-level marketing (MLM) company, the compensation plan is typically a major concern. In the case of 4Life 2025, it’s crucial to grasp how earnings work to determine if it aligns with your financial goals. This plan is designed to reward distributors through various streams of income. Understanding these components lets you navigate your earning potential effectively.

4Life 2025 offers a simple yet effective framework that can empower you to maximize your income. Here’s a detailed look at the key components of the compensation plan:

### Retail Profit

One of the most straightforward ways to earn money in 4Life 2025 is through retail profit. As a distributor, you can purchase products at a wholesale price and sell them to customers at a retail price. The margin between the two prices is your profit. Many distributors enjoy the flexibility of setting their retail prices to fit their market.

### Team Commissions

Team commissions are another income stream. You earn a percentage based on the sales volume produced by your team. This encourages you to build and support your network of distributors. The more successful your team, the more commissions you earn. This aspect of the compensation plan emphasizes teamwork and collective success.

### Leadership Bonuses

Leadership bonuses reward distributors who achieve certain ranks within the organization. As you advance in rank, your earning potential increases significantly. Here are some key aspects of the leadership bonus system:

- **Rank Advancement:** Moving up in the rank offers greater bonus opportunities.
- **Performance Requirements:** Bonuses are typically based on both personal and team performance.
- **Incentives:** Special incentives may be available for reaching certain milestones.

### Matching Bonus

The matching bonus is a unique feature of 4Life’s 2025 compensation plan. This allows you to earn bonuses based on the commissions of your downline distributors. For instance, if your recruit earns $1,000 through their commissions, you may earn a percentage as a matching bonus. This system not only enhances your earnings but also encourages you to mentor your team effectively.

### Leadership Pools

Leadership pools are shared incentives offered to qualifying leaders in the organization. A percentage of the company’s total sales volume is allocated to these pools. As a participating leader, you receive a portion of the pool based on your rank and performance. This is a great way to benefit from the overall success of the company.

### Product Bonuses

In addition to earnings from team work, retail sales, and bonuses, distributors can also benefit from product bonuses. These bonuses reward you for reaching specific sales milestones with 4Life products. The company encourages maintaining high sales volume, ensuring steady income.

### Promotional Rewards

4Life 2025 also offers promotional rewards for achieving specific goals. These rewards can include products, trips, or other luxuries that enhance the overall experience of being a distributor. Focusing on these promotional opportunities can motivate you to excel in your business operations.

### Requirements for Earning

To truly understand how to maximize your earnings in the 4Life 2025 MLM, it’s essential to be aware of specific requirements:

- **Active Participation:** Consistently engage with your audience and recruit new members.
- **Sales Performance:** Maintain a steady sales performance to qualify for various bonuses and commissions.
- **Continuous Learning:** Educate yourself about products and effective strategies to elevate your success.

By comprehending the structure of the 4Life 2025 compensation plan, you’re better equipped to evaluate the financial opportunities that await you. Remember, your success in this MLM largely hinges on your effort, dedication, and ability to inspire others. Take the time to analyze each component, and leverage that knowledge to pave your way to earnings.

Comparing 4Life 2025 to Other MLM Opportunities
-----------------------------------------------

4Life 2025 is an intriguing opportunity in the world of multi-level marketing (MLM). If you're exploring various MLM options, understanding how 4Life 2025 stacks up against its competitors is essential. This comparison will help you identify what makes 4Life 2025 unique and whether it aligns with your goals.

One of the most notable aspects of 4Life 2025 is its focus on health and wellness products. This is a significant factor when compared to other MLM companies, many of whom might branch into beauty, home goods, or financial services. With an increasing number of consumers prioritizing health, a company firmly rooted in this sector could have a robust consumer base. By focusing on products that promote health, 4Life 2025 can position itself in a thriving industry.

Another key feature is the income potential offered through 4Life 2025. The compensation plan is designed to be transparent and rewarding. Many MLMs offer complicated pay structures that can be hard to understand and may feel discouraging for new members. In contrast, 4Life 2025's plan is straightforward, allowing you to grasp how you can earn and grow your income effectively. This simplicity is appealing, especially for newcomers who may feel overwhelmed by their choices.

Now, let’s look closely at some features that distinguish 4Life 2025 from other MLMs:

- **Product Authenticity:** 4Life emphasizes research-backed products, which can boost credibility. With many MLMs facing skepticism about product claims, showcasing verified scientific backing can foster trust among consumers.
- **Flexible Business Model:** The model allows you to work on your terms. Some MLMs require you to maintain hefty inventories or meet high sales quotas. Here, you can focus on what works best for you.
- **Training and Support:** 4Life offers training resources and mentorship that may be lacking in other opportunities. You'll find ongoing support, ensuring you don't feel lost as you start your journey.
- **Community Engagement:** This company invests in building a supportive community among its members. Others might leave you feeling isolated in your efforts, but 4Life encourages collaboration and sharing.

When comparing 4Life 2025 to other MLMs, another aspect to consider is the level of competition in the field. Some MLMs operate in saturated markets, which can make it difficult for new members to make an impact or earn a substantial income. The health and wellness niche may be competitive, but due to its growth, there's still room for newcomers who are passionate and motivated.

Compensation plans can be a make-or-break element in any MLM. While many companies offer rewards based on sales, recruitment plays a significant role in the commission structure. This dual focus can be an uphill battle for some who thrive on product-driven sales. 4Life 2025 encourages sales but gives you the chance to build a team without the overbearing pressure of recruitment quotas.

Moreover, peer relationships within the 4Life community can enhance your experience. Many MLMs lack emphasis on a supportive network, making it tougher to establish connections. In 4Life, your success is celebrated within the community, making the process not only rewarding financially but also socially enriching.

Another point of differentiation is the international presence of 4Life 2025. While some MLMs are restricted to specific regions, 4Life has expanded successfully into numerous countries. This global reach can increase market opportunities for your sales and allow you to connect with a diverse consumer base.

When assessing 4Life 2025 against other MLM opportunities, you'll find a product range that meets contemporary health needs, a transparent compensation system, and solid support structures. The relationship-building aspect and global outreach further enhance its attractiveness, providing a vivid picture of the potential here. If you're passionate about health and wellness and looking to make an authentic impact, 4Life 2025 may just be the opportunity for you. Always remember to research thoroughly and find an MLM that aligns with your personal values and professional aspirations.

### Conclusion

As we wrap up our exploration of the 4Life 2025 MLM opportunity, it’s clear that this business model offers unique features that can appeal to both new and seasoned entrepreneurs. Delving into the structure of 4Life’s business model reveals a blend of community-focused selling and a solid support system. The range of health and wellness products provides participants with reliable offerings that align with current consumer trends, making them easier to promote.

Participants in 4Life 2025 have shared inspiring success stories that highlight real potential for earning and personal growth. These testimonials reinforce the idea that dedication and hard work can lead to genuine rewards. The compensation plan, characterized by clear earning tiers and bonuses, outlines how your efforts can translate into financial success, making it an attractive proposition for those looking to supplement their income.

When placed alongside other MLM opportunities, 4Life 2025 holds its own, boasting a robust reputation and a commitment to quality products. The combination of innovative marketing strategies and effective training programs makes it a competitive choice in the MLM marketplace.

Ultimately, if you’re considering joining an MLM, 4Life 2025 presents a compelling opportunity worth exploring. With its focus on health products, supportive community, and a solid compensation structure, it may fulfill your entrepreneurial aspirations while maintaining your passion for wellness. Make sure to weigh the benefits against your own goals to determine if this is the right fit for you.

A Niagara vacation,Tik_tok_stories,1i9anmj,2025-01-24 19:35:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1i9anmj/a_niagara_vacation/,babyxxpigeon17,,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered"

Did Not Switch to v3 Extension - LUNA Now Missing,terraluna,1i99aty,2025-01-24 18:31:12,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/terraluna/comments/1i99aty/did_not_switch_to_v3_extension_luna_now_missing/,GrassIZgreenuh,Terra Ecosystem,"Panicking a bit. I went to Terra Station to check my LUNA balance only to find it state under my Mainnet account ""This account doesn't hold any coins yet."" I still have USTC that shows up under Classic though.

I saw that I was supposed to switch to the Station Extension before Dec 31, 2024. I guess foolishly I thought I'd be fine because I wasn't planning to move my LUNA since it was still delegating, so I did not switch over prior to Dec 31. I just now tried to get set up with the new Station v3 Dashboard/Extension, but with no success. I tried to ""Import Wallet"" and used my 12 word Recovery Phrase. It seemed like it was going to take it, but then goes to a Select Wallet screen that reads ""Select the wallet derivation path you would like to use"" and has an aminated station flying through the air. Nothing further happens and there's nothing for me to select.

I tried using the Edge extension and got the same exact results. I tried downloading the Station mobile app for iPhone and before I even get to a screen that asks for my recovery phrase, it states ""Too many requests. Try again later.""

I saw in another post that someone mentioned Keplr. I tried the import wallet feature there. It accepted my recovery phrase, but none of my LUNA showed up. 

I'm at a loss. Any advice on what to do? "
I'm a College Student Who Ditched TV and Social Media—and Can Actually Focus Again,nosurf,1i97zmb,2025-01-24 17:32:15,99,0.97,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1i97zmb/im_a_college_student_who_ditched_tv_and_social/,LiftingC,,"# The end of my mind numbing tv bingeing and pointless scrolling:

My name is Carrie, as a 22-year-old college student living in Michigan, I was raised during the rise of some of the biggest social media and streaming services. I often spend 35-40 hours a week consuming a variety of the most popular services. But, as a side effect of my overconsumption for over 5 years, my attention span has been declining rapidly.

What motivated me to change my habits was a YouTube video that was in my recommendations by [Jared Henderson](https://www.youtube.com/@_jared). In [“Why we can’t focus.”](https://youtu.be/6QltxZ-vPMc?feature=shared), he explains that when we transitioned from print media to television, attention spans began to decline, and continue to decline as we transition from television to social media. He continues to say that when reading books, we give our attention and focus to it, while social media and TV steal our attention from us.

After taking advantage of my local library and its digital resources, along with the public domain book collection of [“Project Gutenberg”](https://www.gutenberg.org/), I got my focus back plus my passion for reading, writing, and drawing has returned.

My game plan:

**What are you doing?**

I am giving up social media and streaming for as long as it takes to no longer feel dependent on it for entertainment.

**Why are you doing this?**

I often spend my free time on my phone. Here is usually what I spend my time doing:

* I binge-watch TV shows, even after I lose interest in the story.
* I will be watching a YouTube video, then switch to another as soon as I begin to lose interest in what I am watching.
* I watch YouTube late at night and have difficulties going to sleep on a regular schedule.
* I mindlessly scroll through social media and check for new likes on my posts when I can’t think of anything else to do.
* I have begun mindless eating while watching TV shows.
* I often feel like I don’t have enough time for my studies.

I want to replace these habits with things that promote better mental health:

* Read more books and listen to audiobooks, especially during my work commute.
* Write short stories and poetry on a regular basis.
* Spend more free time drawing and painting.

**How are you going to do this?**

1.) Canceled all streaming subscriptions

2.) Deleted all social media apps from my phone

3.) Turned off recommendations on video-sharing platforms to avoid clicking on an enticing-looking video while using it for schoolwork.

4.) Downloaded the Libby App

5.) Downloaded the Hoopla App

6.) Downloaded the Amazon Kindle App

8.) Familiarized myself with [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) collection

7.) Dusted off and charged up my Kindle E-Reader

**What I want to get out of this:**

I hope that by not streaming or using social media for a while, I will realize that it is not as important to keep up with everything and everyone. I also want to get into the routine of reading daily and take advantage of what my local library has to offer. One of my main concerns is that whenever I have a meal, I watch TV and that it may take time getting used to not doing that.

# Weekly reflections:

**Week 1**

**Sun:** I am finding it very hard not to watch TV while eating, it is something that I have done since I was a teen. Instead of sitting down to a meal in silence, I found it helped if I had an audiobook playing.

**Mon:** As I mentioned earlier in this post, I have difficulties with falling asleep on a regular schedule. Surprisingly, on my first night of lying down in bed without being on my phone, I was tired enough to fall asleep within 15 minutes of reading.

**Tues:** I continuously was tempted to redownload social media apps. I kept wanting to see what people in my hobby groups were up to, along with keeping up with a few social media influencers. But, I resisted.

Also, when I started to get tired later in the evening I was tempted to put on some TV, but I decided to take a quick nap instead.

**Wed:** Something weird happened today, I sat down to have a snack in the evening at my computer desk, my computer was turned on and the browser was also opened. When I went for another bite of my snack, and during that, my empty hand began typing “you” in the search bar. I didn’t even realize I was doing it until I looked up at my screen. I stopped myself, turned my computer chair around, and finished eating.

I also caught myself a few times grabbing my phone and turning it on without any intent of what I was going to do on it. I would end up just sitting it back down.

**Thurs:** I realized that I prefer listening to music, more specifically Jazz while eating versus listening to an audiobook. I feel like I space out on the audiobook during that time and don’t retain much of what was read to me.

**Fri:** I am starting to realize how much free time I have by not watching TV and YouTube. I feel like I get an extra 2-3 hours a day now by actually being mindful of what I am doing.

I also am beginning to have an interest in creating art again. When I have tried to be TV and social media free in the past, I usually last for only a week, but during that time, I usually become interested in more mentally demanding hobbies like making art or playing a musical instrument.

**Sat:** I started noticing that I feel much more aware of my surroundings and over the past few days I have caught myself not being in the present moment and thinking about things that happened yesterday, a week ago, or years ago. I am noticing that I am able to refocus myself on what tasks I am doing in that moment.

**This week’s wrap-up:**

I surprised myself this week, I did not think that the transition from watching TV while eating, to not would take me several weeks to feel comfortable with. But at this point, I don’t miss it that much. I also don’t miss checking in on social media as much as I thought I would. Something that is a little challenging for me this week is that I noticed I am becoming more mentally exhausted than usual at the end of the day, I am not used to it, but I do have to admit it has helped my sleep schedule out significantly.

**Week 2**

**Sun:** This morning, I wrote for about an hour and then worked on a math assignment. Afterwards, I was cleaning a few dishes in the kitchen, and I had a thought new to myself; “I want to do something pretty mindless after this.”.

I have never intentionally said to myself that I want to do a mindless task, because that usually means that it is something boring. But I am wondering if it is my brain’s way of telling myself, you need a break from the intense focus of reading, writing, drawing, studying, etc. I have some software that I was planning on getting downloaded on my computer sooner than later, so I will work on that today.

**Mon:** I still often find myself turning on and looking at my phone for no reason out of habit. I also catch myself beginning to type in Reddit or YouTube on my computer or phone’s search bar mindlessly.

Today I noticed as well that I am starting to enjoy sitting and doing tasks in silence, without music or an audiobook. Whenever I tried doing this in the past, it would begin to drive me crazy, and I would put something on the TV for background noise. I am assuming this is a sign that my brain is getting used to not being stimulated all the time.

**Tues:** I had a snow day from school, so I spent most of my day reading and then did some drawing. I never thought I would be one of those people who would sit and read all day, yet here we are.

**Wed:** I am noticing that I have a longer attention span while doing my schoolwork, I also feel less in a rush because I am not in a hurry to sit down and watch TV.

**Thurs:** Due to inclement weather, my commute by bus took an extended period of time. Luckily, I had started bringing my kindle with me everywhere in case of such an event. It made the time go by much quicker compared to how I usually hop from one video to the next on YouTube, finding anything to entertain my boredom. When I arrived home, it felt good knowing that I was actually doing something productive and that I enjoyed while waiting, not out of “necessity” like it felt with my phone.

Over the past few days, I have been able to successfully have a meal in silence and just reflect on the books I have been reading, think about any tasks that I need to complete later that day, or just look outside and see if there are any points of interest, *normally there is not*, but I still have found it quite relaxing.

**Fri:** I just finished reading Bambi – A Life in the Woods. It was about a 4-hour read, and truthfully surpassed all of the greatest stories that I have read by text and watched by film. It is so unfortunate that many people of my generation will not take the time to read these classics, as this one is so much deeper than you would expect.

**Sat:** Today is my final day of journaling this experience, but not the last of reading. It was quite an interesting 2 weeks, and I was shocked how quickly I adapted to reading during my spare time. I did not at all expect it to be this seamless. I do have to admit though, the first 3-5 days were rough. Even worse, on day 2 I was very much tempted to give up and just switch on the TV. I am so glad that I didn’t though as now I have gotten so many of my old hobbies back that were lost to my total indulgence in TV and social media for many years.

**This week’s wrap-up:**

Over this past week, I noticed that doing what at the beginning felt like “less” (less exciting, too quiet, plain boring) has led me to realize that reading can be fun, and when not being overstimulated all the time, it has given me more energy to do more creative endeavors. I have gotten back my drive to read, write, and draw, which has not interested me for a long time.

# What I learned:

From my experience, over consuming entertainment like, YouTube, social media, and video games is so easy. It satisfies and occupies my mind enough where I don’t feel the need to create anything on my own, and reading had always felt like a chore more than anything else.

As soon as I intentionally decided to block these things from my life, it actually opened the door to more interesting hobbies that were meaningful to me. I also would always complain that I did not have time for these hobbies, due to me being too busy. But after removing unnecessary distractions from my life, each day went from feeling like a highspeed time warp, to the hours of the day steadily passing by.

# What I have gained:

* I have been able to fall asleep quicker at night
* I have more mental clarity
* I can organize my thoughts better
* I find myself being in the present moment much more often or able to get myself into that state more easily.
* I have found interest again in hobbies like reading, drawing, and writing

# Offline highlights during these 2 weeks:

**Books read:**

Bambi: A Life in the Woods – By: Felix Salten (Finished)

Grandma Gatewood’s Walk – By: Ben Montgomery (Close to 50% finished)

**Audiobooks listened to:**

The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs – By: Steve Brusatte (01:17:00 of it, after the first hour, I realized that I am not that interested in learning the entire history of dinosaurs)

Becoming – By: Michelle Obama (Time Stamp 01:22:00)

Why Avocados Are Essential for a Healthy Diet,u_EZElife,1i97nqk,2025-01-24 17:17:47,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EZElife/comments/1i97nqk/why_avocados_are_essential_for_a_healthy_diet/,EZElife,,"**Superfood That Stands Out: Why Avocados Are Good for Your Health**

Hey there, avocado aficionado! Ever wondered why these creamy delights are all the rage? They’re not just a tasty treat; they’re like a hug for your health. From Central and South America’s kitchens to our very own, these little green wonders have made quite the journey. Let’s dive into why avocados are hailed as superfoods.

# The Nutrient Treasure Chest

Imagine a treasure chest packed with gems. That’s an avocado for your body. Loaded with vitamins and minerals, they give your body what it craves. Potassium, for example, is like the unsung hero in maintaining healthy blood pressure. And trust me, that’s just the tip of the iceberg!

# Heart's Best Buddy

Avocados have your heart’s back. Those good fats—yeah, the monounsaturated ones—keep cholesterol in check. Potassium acts like a guardian angel for your blood pressure. Studies show that the more potassium you get, the happier your heart becomes.

# Weight Wizardry

Think avocados make you chubby? Nah, think again! The fats in avocados fill you up without filling you out, keeping those hunger pangs at bay. Plus, they're fiber-packed, meaning they make your tummy and waistline do a happy dance.

# Glow from the Inside Out

Want skin and hair that make people do a double-take? Enter avocados. Vitamin E works wonders for elasticity and hydration. Avocado oil’s like a spa treatment right at home. And those healthy fats? They give your hair that “just came from the salon” shine.

# Eye Spy Healthy Peepers

Avocados are like sunglasses for your eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the bodyguards of your vision, protecting against harmful rays and age-related issues. Munching on avocados could mean sharper vision for longer. It’s like having HD vision, naturally.

# Inflammation Fighter

Got inflammation woes? Avocados are here to save the day. Their fats and antioxidants could be the magic bullet against chronic inflammation. It’s like having a peace treaty with your body.

# Brain Booster

Your brain loves avocados. Those healthy fats keep brain cells in tip-top shape. Vitamin E keeps oxidative stress at bay. And folate? It’s a big deal, especially for moms-to-be, boosting those neurotransmitters.

# Kitchen Chameleon

Avocados are the chameleons of the kitchen. Think beyond guac! They blend into smoothies, add creaminess to desserts, and even make a mean avocado toast. Their versatility? Unmatched.

# Myth Busting

Let’s squash some avocado myths. They’re not fattening if enjoyed in moderation. Ripening them isn’t rocket science. Unripe ones have their own uses! Time to give those misunderstandings the boot!

**Myth 1: Avocados Are Fattening**

One of the most persistent myths is that avocados are fattening. While it’s true that avocados are rich in fats, remember that they are packed with healthy monounsaturated fats. These are the good fats that can help lower bad cholesterol levels and support heart health. You can enjoy avocados in moderation. Eating half an avocado a day can be delicious and nutritious. This can be part of a balanced diet without the fear of piling on the pounds.

**Myth 2: Ripening Avocados Is Rocket Science**

Many people shy away from buying avocados. They aren’t sure how to properly ripen them. However, it’s not as complex as it seems. Simply leave them out at room temperature, and they’ll ripen in a few days. Want to speed up the process? Store them in a brown paper bag with an apple or banana. The natural ethylene gas produced by these fruits will help the avocado ripen faster. Once ripe, you can refrigerate them to slow down further ripening, extending their freshness.

# Picking the Perfect Avocado

Grab one that’s just a little soft to the touch. Too hard? Give it a few days on the counter. Once ripe, stash it in the fridge. Leftovers? Keep the pit in, sprinkle with lemon juice, and wrap it up tight. Keep it fresh and fab!

# Recipe Corner: Avocado Burger

Want a tasty twist on the classic burger? Try this: Get a lean turkey or veggie patty. Add a ripe avocado. Use a whole-grain or lettuce wrap bun. Top with your favorite toppings. Mash that avocado, spread it on, and voila! Your taste buds will thank you!

Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for a healthy avocado burger that you can try at home:

# Ingredients:

* 1 ripe avocado
* 1 lean turkey or veggie burger patty
* 1 whole-grain or lettuce wrap bun
* 1 slice of tomato
* 1 slice of red onion
* Handful of fresh spinach or arugula
* 1 tablespoon Greek yogurt or hummus (optional)
* Pinch of salt and pepper

# Instructions:

1. Cook the turkey or veggie patty according to the package instructions or your preferred method.
2. While the patty cooks, slice the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash it with a fork until smooth, and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Prepare the bun or lettuce wrap by spreading Greek yogurt or hummus on the bottom layer (if using).
4. Layer the spinach or arugula, cooked patty, sliced tomato, and red onion.
5. Top the patty with a generous dollop of mashed avocado.
6. Place the top bun or wrap on and serve immediately.

So there you have it—avocados are more than just a pretty face. They're a total health package wrapped in green skin. Get munching, and your body will thank you.

* Everything in my want list here: [https://gametz.com/user/TheMaskedMoon/WantedGames.html](https://gametz.com/user/TheMaskedMoon/WantedGames.html)
* N64 games and/or manuals (I am going for a complete set, currently at \~100 games and a handful of manuals)
* Feel free to send me your list, but if it doesn't contain at least one of those two things above then I'm unlikely to accept
* **I am ONLY looking for black label items in at least Very Good or Near Mint condition.** That means no stickers, writing, sun fading, moisture damage, smoke damage, Greatest hits / Player's Choice, etc. I'm not as picky about disc scratches though, so long as it's not excessive.
* I am also only interested in disc-based games which include both the original case and manual (and, ideally, all of the inserts). This also extends to Sega Genesis and Nintendo DS games.

Other info:

* Check out my thread in r/GameSale if you'd like to purchase anything
* All games have been tested and are guaranteed to work without any issues, including audio skipping. However, it's possible some slipped through the cracks, so please let me know if you encounter any problems
* Listed conditions are estimates, please ask for pictures if concerned about the specific condition of an item. Listed condition also does not account for any disc scratches which do not affect functionality (unless otherwise noted)
* Items listed as ""CIB"" include at least the original case/box and manual (if applicable). Additional inserts may or may not be included
* I have not confirmed the functionality of any save batteries for cartridge games, but to my knowledge none of them have been replaced; Some of these games are decades old and if they aren't dead yet, they will be soon. If you care about your saves, you should always assume the worst and replace the battery after purchasing. **I will not offer returns for dead save batteries**.

Understanding the Low Fermentation/Cedar Sinai Diet,SIBO,1i969ot,2025-01-24 16:17:44,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1i969ot/understanding_the_low_fermentationcedar_sinai_diet/,mossyday,,"Hoping someone can explain this to me...  
  
I know that the Low Fermentation/Cedars-Sinai Diet is often described as ""less restrictive"" than the low FODMAP diet, but there are some things that are restricted more. For example, many lettuces show no FODMAPs at all in the Monash app, and the ones that do have FODMAPs are still approved in small doses, so why is lettuce completely off the table in Low Fermentation Diet? Similarly, beans, lentils, cabbage are a no-go, but they are allowed in Low-FODMAP in small doses.

And then on the other hand, the Low Fermentation Diet allows white bread, mushrooms, onions on free reign, but those are classic FODMAPs triggers! 

I know there is something about reducing fiber in the low Fermentation Diet, but I'm not totally grasping that either.

I would love to understand the ""why"" behind these guidelines. Most of the diet feels intuitive to me, but there are some nuances here that I'm having a harder time wrapping my brain around. I haven't been able to find a resource that explains the reasoning to those low fermentation guidelines, just lots of food guides.   
  
I'm on my last three days of the Elemental Diet, so I want to feel confident around the next steps once I'm reintroducing food. Thank you!"

One of the first HC purchases I made in 2020 was a lot of Marvel Premiere Classic Edition DM Variant Hardcovers. All 5 of them came with Mylar Dust Jacket Protectors. You could just tell that they'd been put in a DJ protector since new. These books were all ~10 years old and still looked crispy clean. I messaged the seller and got more info on them, and it's been a wrap ever since. Basically, BrodArt and Demco are the 2 brands.

I use Demco, but I've gotten BrodArt protectors before on books. I always appreciate it when I get a book with a protector on it...if I see a sales post in FB groups and the HCs have protectors, I'm more likely to browse what they have. I currently use Demco's SuperFold line, but I used to use their PaperFold line of mylar DJ protectors because that's what my local library uses. They cover DJs for $2 each. It was not a bad deal when only covering a few at a time.... but then I started to realize how expensive it is compared to just buying my own 300' roll. I've lucked out both times I've purchased rolls and gotten them secondhand with only ~10 feet used on them. I got my 1st roll in September 2023. I have about 50 feet left now. I just bought the 2nd roll last Saturday and it's arriving tomorrow. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm excited. I've really slowed down these last couple months on opening my new books and covering them bcuz I knew I was going to run out soon. Not anymore! 

Demco's PaperFold and SuperFold mylar DJ protectors are perforated, so you can use it on a variety of book sizes. PaperFold mylar is 1.5mil thick. SuperFold is 2mil thick, so 33% thicker. It definitely makes a difference. For OHCs, go for the 12"" height ones of PaperFold or SuperFold. They fit fine still on Marvel Premiere Edition standard size Hardcover dust jackets.

You can buy 300' rolls as well as sheets of 10, 50, and 500 of the SuperFold. 300 foot rolls cost $76 for PaperFold to $91 for SuperFold on the Demco website. I'm unsure how much shipping is. If going the 24"" sheet route, they're going to be a little bit short and not cover all of the flaps. I've found that Omnis typically use 26-28""."
Concepts for a business update?,Bloxburg,1i95rks,2025-01-24 15:55:57,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloxburg/comments/1i95rks/concepts_for_a_business_update/,Idkwhatshappeningxx,Suggestion,"If we got a business update; that is an update for people who own business/ cafes/ restaurants etc, what would be some nice items/features to add to the game?

Some suggestions I have:

1. Customizable menus/ posters/ pamphlets: which you can grab and inspect closer. 


2. Food wrapping: where you can grab a bunch of items and use a machine to put everything in a bag/ box. So something like the trays we have but instead of holding a tray with a bunch of food, we’re holding a take out bag/ box with food


3. Customizable logos: (using decals) on mugs, take out boxes, trays etc


4. Customizable Billboards around town: where you pay to put your advertisement up


5. Customizable party invite feature: the current party invite feature but using decals (Roblox censors out inappropriate decals so it’s not going to be that bad). This would make the party invites more personal and better.


6. Customizable menu items: this could be tricky. But some items like cake, coffee etc can be such a way where the plot owner can make their own drinks/ cakes/ cupcakes based on the colors and flavours and can be used on the menu and make it a permanent recipe for their own plot. (Idk how to explain help)


7. Outfit mannequin: where you can load outfits for staff (using clothes codes) and people can wear it just by clicking. This will be useful in schools, and can also be used in clothes stores. Since this could be complicated, they can make it only for classic clothes.


8. Doors with keypad locks: this can be helpful for hotels so that only the guests can access the room.


9. Global event feature: so this is like the party feature, but it’s available for all servers. Like the public neighborhood feature but there’s a separate tab for all the current ongoing events.


10. Business kiosk: stay with me cuz this might be confusing. So basically imagine you own a cafe in bloxburg and you want to make a kiosk for that cafe. You get a designated space to build a kiosk and customize it according to your preferences. Now you can advertise your kiosks to other people who can buy it at their plots. For eg: people with stadiums, malls, zoos, schools etcs can buy your kiosk and you get a share of the buying cost + your brand can be promoted.


11. Phones! A lot of business features can be added to the phone- like customizable apps (Im getting too ambitious yall, bloxburg cant even fix the glitching grass and im talking about apps😭), business reviews, hiring ads etc. 


This is all I can think of, but if you guys have any businesses and have any features that you would like to see added, drop your ideas"
"Serious FINRA Allegations Leveled Against Suspended Financial Advisor, Louis Pellegriti",StockMarketNewsToday,1i95fmo,2025-01-24 15:41:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarketNewsToday/comments/1i95fmo/serious_finra_allegations_leveled_against/,auto556,,"### From Champion to Pariah: A Financier’s Fall from Grace

How to Book a Party Princess in Denver for Your Child’s Birthday,u_Jinanlee,1i94uh9,2025-01-24 15:16:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jinanlee/comments/1i94uh9/how_to_book_a_party_princess_in_denver_for_your/,Jinanlee,,"Every child deserves a birthday filled with magic, laughter, and unforgettable memories. What better way to create an enchanting experience than by bringing their favorite princess to life? Hiring a party princess for your child’s birthday celebration in Denver can elevate the event and leave your little one and their guests in awe. But how do you ensure a smooth and stress-free booking process? This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to make your event a magical success.

# 1. Decide on the Perfect Princess

Start by identifying your child’s favorite princess. Whether it’s a classic fairy-tale character or a more modern royal heroine, the choice of princess can set the tone for the entire party. Talk to your child about their favorite stories or movies and use their interests to guide your decision. This will help create a meaningful and personalized experience.

# 2. Plan Your Budget

Before booking, determine how much you’re willing to spend. Princess party packages vary widely in price based on factors like duration, the number of characters, and the services included. Some packages offer additional activities like games, storytelling, or singing performances, so decide which extras are worth the investment to make the celebration truly magical.

# 3. Choose the Right Party Date and Time

Timing is everything when booking a party princess. To ensure availability, try to book at least 4-6 weeks in advance, especially during busy seasons like summer or the winter holidays. Consider the best time of day for young guests—late mornings or early afternoons are often ideal for kids’ parties. Having a set date and time in mind will make the booking process smoother.

# 4. Research Local Princess Services

Denver offers a variety of options for booking party princesses, so take time to research providers in your area. Look for companies or performers with a strong reputation, glowing reviews, and photos or videos of past events. Pay close attention to their costumes and character portrayal to ensure they meet your expectations. It’s always helpful to ask for references or testimonials from other parents who have used their services.

# 5. Check What’s Included in the Package

Before finalizing your booking, review the details of the princess party package. Some performers include activities like singing, storytelling, face painting, or hosting games. Others may offer photo opportunities and a special gift for the birthday child. Make sure the package aligns with your vision for the party and provides value for your budget.

# 6. Consider the Venue

Your choice of venue can play a significant role in how smoothly the event runs. Whether you’re hosting at home, at a park, or in a rented space, ensure the location is appropriate for the princess activities. A well-decorated venue that matches the theme will enhance the magic and make the princess’s arrival even more special. Communicate with the performer to confirm they are comfortable with the venue and its setup.

# 7. Ask Questions Before Booking

It’s important to ask any questions you may have before confirming your booking. Some helpful questions include:

* What activities are included in the performance?
* Do they stay in character the entire time?
* How long will the princess be at the party?
* Do they bring their own props and supplies?
* Are there any restrictions, such as group size or venue requirements? Clarifying these details upfront will help you avoid surprises and ensure the experience meets your expectations.

# 8. Plan the Princess’s Arrival

The moment the princess enters is often the highlight of the party. Coordinate with the performer to make sure their arrival feels magical and seamless. You might want to have the children gathered in one area for a big “royal reveal.” Play theme-appropriate music or create an announcement to build excitement for their grand entrance.

# 9. Prepare the Guests for the Experience

Let the parents of invited children know that a princess will be making an appearance. Encourage the little guests to dress up as their favorite characters to match the theme. This helps immerse everyone in the magical experience and creates adorable photo opportunities.

# 10. Add Personal Touches to the Event

Work with the performer to incorporate personal details into the experience. For example, the princess could include your child’s name in her storytelling or lead a birthday song. Small touches like these make the event feel even more special and memorable.

# 11. Capture the Memories

Don’t forget to document the magic! Designate someone to take photos and videos during the princess’s performance. A dedicated photo session with the princess is a must-have, and the images will become cherished keepsakes for years to come.

# 12. Prepare for Post-Party Wrap-Up

Once the princess bids her royal farewell, keep the magic alive with a small takeaway for the guests. Princess-themed goodie bags or party favors like crowns, wands, or bracelets make the perfect keepsakes for little attendees to remember the day.

Booking a party princess in Denver is a wonderful way to create an unforgettable birthday experience for your child. By carefully planning and choosing the right services, you can bring your child’s favorite character to life and make their special day truly magical.

Welcome back to Canon Fodder!

The year is 2025. _Halo: Empty Throne_ is just weeks away, Waypoint Chronicles will be dropping out of slipspace alongside upcoming _Halo Infinite_ Operations, and there’s another book by Kelly Gay on the horizon that we teased during last year’s Halo World Championship…

Let’s start there.

* * *

##  **HALO: EDGE OF DAWN**

Now in this hour of waking, ahead of the release of _Empty Throne_, a new _Halo_ book is baking and waiting to be shown.

It is with great excitement that we can formally announce acclaimed author Kelly Gay’s next novel, **_Halo: Edge of Dawn_**.

We’re not sharing any specific story information just yet, but we can indeed confirm at this time that this is ‘A Master Chief Story’—so that just might clue you into at least one character who will prominently appear in the book!

After her incredible tales with titanic characters like 343 Guilty Spark, the Didact, the Librarian, and Cortana, we couldn’t be more excited to have Kelly put her pen to John-117.

 _Edge of Dawn_ is due to release towards the very end of this year, so stay tuned for further details. The official description, cover art, chapter previews, and so on are all still to come.

Let the speculation begin!

* * *

##  **MONITORING THE MONITOR**

Last month, we released our final Waypoint Chronicle of 2024, _Halo: Whispers from the Pyre_. In case you missed it, you can [read it here on Halo Waypoint](https://aka.ms/PyreWhispers), [grab a free PDF version](https://aka.ms/PyreWhispersPDF), or [listen to the audiobook version on YouTube](https://aka.ms/PyreWhispersAudio) (featuring the voice of Sarah Elmaleh herself as Zeta Halo’s monitor, Despondent Pyre).

Now that you’ve all had a chance to digest the story, we wanted to dive a little deeper into its events and reveals.

 **PARTICULAR PARALLELS**

While Waypoint Chronicles are generally standalone short stories set across a variety of different locations in different times and with different characters, there are ways that some of them connect.

Back in November, we released _Age of Retribution_, which took place during the events of _Halo 2_ and showed a Covenant Sangheili perspective on the death of the Prophet of Regret and the subsequent onset of the Great Schism as Jiralhanae forces arrive, eager for blood.

[[Screenshot of youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/yiwBAoPVTIQ/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/yiwBAoPVTIQ?si=kXn4LQ4GrcrjLXDF)

[Watch on Youtube](https://youtu.be/yiwBAoPVTIQ?si=kXn4LQ4GrcrjLXDF)

With _Whispers from the Pyre_, we were keen to draw some direct parallels with that story, but from a Banished perspective. When Studymaster ‘Yaham encounters a pack of Jiralhanae, his reaction is not of fearful anticipation of violence, but relief. News of the passing of Escharum is met with sadness by this Sangheili, who proclaims that the war chief was _daskalo_ to all, just as the Prophet of Regret was known for his martial inclination and favor towards the Sangheili.

Through these parallels, keen-eyed readers might notice some of the similarities and differences between the Covenant and the Banished. While species-based rivalries definitely still exist in the ranks of the Banished, its open opportunities for glory—something ‘Yaham and Dahk’rah seek through attaining useful knowledge—allows us to see different dynamics play out between those who once were foes.

 **TUDEJSA TOTEMS**

[Halo Infinite screenshot of ring totem artifacts being studied at Annex Ridge](https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2025/01/HI_AnnexRidge.jpg) ^^[\[Imgur\]](https://i.imgur.com/F2MX2Gm.jpeg)

Perhaps the most notable detail in this story concerns the construction of the ring totem artifacts encountered in _Halo Infinite_. As Despondent Pyre reveals, these were built by the Tudejsa.

“Tudejsa” is a word that translates to “the People” or “the People from Here,” specifically referring to the humans who were brought to Zeta Halo one hundred thousand years ago.

* * *

 _“The Librarian has always favored humans, much to the dismay of the Didact. As part of the Council’s agreement, the Librarian was given space on several of the Master Builder’s installations. Humans were brought to this one—over one hundred and twenty varieties, many hundreds of thousands of individuals. Others were placed on the great Arks where Halos are built and restored. All were designated as reserve populations, not to be tampered with.”_

 **_Halo: Primordium_, Chapter 19**

* * *

_(Naturally, the Forerunners tampered with them!)_

Among the Tudejsa were Vinnevra and her grandfather Gameplar, both of whom accompanied Chakas on his journey across Zeta Halo (then known as Gyre 11) throughout _[Halo: Primordium](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Halo-Primordium/Greg-Bear/HALO/9781982111779)_ —the second book of Greg Bear’s Forerunner Saga—as they encountered the numerous horrors that had taken shape on the ring.

##  **MIDNIGHT MOTION**

For Halloween last year, we rereleased the incredible motion comic _Halo: The Mona Lisa_ which was animated by Juan “ONE” Feliz. In case you missed it, or if you were looking for a sign to go and rewatch this fantastic adaptation of the _Halo: Evolutions_ story by Tessa Kum and Jeff VanderMeer, this is it!

[[Screenshot of youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vc_Pv-JMvsE/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vc_Pv-JMvsE?si=gIqm5gJErtjlci9i)

[Watch on Youtube](https://youtu.be/Vc_Pv-JMvsE?si=gIqm5gJErtjlci9i)

If you enjoyed that, we have another _Halo: Evolutions_ motion comic rerelease coming next week— _Halo: Midnight in the Heart of Midlothian_.

This fantastic short story by Frank O’Connor follows Sergeant Michael Baird, Scottish ODST beefcake, who is aboard the UNSC destroyer _The Heart of Midlothian_ receiving treatment for cancer—something that is relatively trivial to treat in the twenty-sixth century with the advanced technology many human colonies possess (well, _Inner_ Colonies, at least).

[Image of Halo: Midnight in the Heart of Midlothian depicting Sergeant Michael Baird wielding a Covenant carbine and scalpel with stylized eyes appearing like wings behind him](https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2025/01/MidnightInTheHeartOfMidlothian.jpg) ^^[\[Imgur\]](https://i.imgur.com/74wI2Rv.jpeg)

While he is unconscious after his treatment, Baird awakens to discover that he is the sole survivor aboard the ship. A Covenant special operations boarding force has killed the entire crew, and the AI Mo Ye recruits Baird to fulfil his duty: enact the Cole Protocol.

Protect humanity. Whatever the cost.

We’ll dig deeper into this story in our next issue. In the meantime, stay tuned for its rerelease next week!

* * *

##  **ARMORY INFINITUM**

The disruptor was a new weapon introduced in _Halo Infinite_. This shock-based pistol of Jiralhanae design was built by the Sicatt Workshop to incapacitate and immobilize targets—from armored infantry to vehicles and equipment, provided enough of its small active-dynamo munitions hit their mark to detonate.

Its special weapon variant in _Halo Infinite_'s campaign is the Calcine Disruptor, wielded by Bipbap the Vanquisher—a fearsome Unggoy who notably once served Chieftain Tartarus as a bodyguard, fueling his ruthlessness even against his own kind.

[Halo Infinite screenshot of Bipbap](https://wpassets.halowaypoint.com/wp-content/2025/01/Bipbap.jpg) ^^[\[Imgur\]](https://i.imgur.com/29EsQVf.jpeg)

 **[RECORDED EXCERPT OF BLOODSTAR BIPBAP IN CONVERSATION WITH WARLORD CHAK ‘LOK]**

You see, the great thing about Unggoy is that we add biiiig numbers to an army! Unggoy grow quick, live fast, and… well, die lots. No problem, just wait a little bit and BAM! You replaced everybody who died already.

But the trouble with Unggoy is when they gets ideas, start thinkin’ that they can band together and take over the army all by themselves. Because they’re right! By sheer statistiticks, Unggoy would easily rule all if we wanted. Prophets never got more scareds than when Unggoy were being disobedient—and we did that like, what, ninety-seven times? Sixty thousand? I forget. It was _a lot_.

Banished knows how to keep orders though. The commanders know I like keepin’ orders, so they gave me this neat gun to help! Alchemy Corps Brute hands it over and I immediately start blastin’ this one guy, tried to steal my stuff—STAY AWAY FROM MY ROCKS!—and suddenly the zappy thing starts hittin’ a bunch of other guys without me even needing to shoot ‘em. So next time the Unggoy do a disobedience, I gotta use this zappy gun to keep ‘em in line!

Morality is always an interesting philosophical topic to engage with when it comes to fictional characters placed in larger-than-life situations. _Halo_ has no end of characters who have done terrible things in the name of survival and the greater good, which makes for some interesting character study opportunities. Absolutely check out Woody’s latest video which morally dissects the Master Chief, Arbiter Thel ‘Vadam, Dr. Halsey, Atriox, and many more!

If you can believe it, there has consistently been a Canon Fodder issue on a monthly basis since May 2021. That's a rather incredible milestone—nearly _four full years_ of monthly Canon Fodders!

Currently, we’re heads down working on the future of _Halo_ —from continued support for _Halo Infinite_ (and the Waypoint Chronicles connected to some of those updates) to upcoming books, and of course future game projects. As a result, the cadence of Canon Fodder will be changing to release every other month.

But worry not, as you will have plenty of awesome story and lore material to keep you occupied in February. _Halo: Empty Throne_ releases on February 18, and in the weeks leading up to its arrival we have two chapter previews on the way that you will definitely want to check out.

We’ll be back before you know it!

*Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative offices*

Undersecretary Ah'nuriel was having a very odd day. Of course, odd days were becoming almost normal of late. Her husband had sent her a long message detailing how much he missed her scent. She'd gotten fairly good at guessing what wasn't being said over the past few years. Messages with hidden meaning were only meaningful if you knew how to read them. And what was being said was difficult - most of their contracted work was going to the Sword of the Light Gods, however the Terrans were beginning to hire companies of their own accord. That was the reason for the meeting today. A Terran who appeared to be wearing subtle joint braces underneath a very oddly fashioned suit - it covered the entirety of his body, with a few cloth decorations. The entire thing was black save for a white shirt. His sunglasses were unusual, and not just because he only had two eyes. They were square and very dark, making his entire hatchet-looking furless face somehow more off-putting. Old instincts were warning her that this Terran brought danger to her door.

The undersecretary took a breath, remembering that somehow this species was a formidable one – and one of her tasks was to find out why. Still, the Terran was polite enough and allowed himself to be sniffed first. His scent was cloying, and almost resembled a Minister's in some ways – there was an honest deception to him, as if he expected things to be withheld.

She took a breath, considering her first move. ""So how can the Trade Cooperative assist you today...""

The man smiled easily. ""Smith will suffice. Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. We'd like to investigate an opportunity for trade. If you're not familiar with us, our business is risk assessment at the core. We assess risk and set a price on assuming a worst-case scenario for that risk. In dangerous times we may refuse to do business in an area entirely. But now with the peace accords, the risk is substantially lower. We'd like some assistance from the Trade Cooperative.""

And there was the deception wrapped in a smooth voice. Or at least the first one. Their business wasn't entirely risk assessment, but something else. The undersecretary kept her fur low with an effort. ""Well, our business is the trade of goods, so there may be areas of overlap. But I'm not certain what more we could commit to without specifics.""

""Well, multiple Terran companies have expressed interest in forming permanent partnerships here and paying well for their partnership. Worlds like yours and Hurdop Prime are rare – high gravity, atmosphere conducive to our life forms, and land that's good for many crops. Not Terran, of course; your gravity would kill most of our plant life. But, as a manufacturing center, many things that you can make here are far more expensive to make on other worlds. In addition, there are Terrans who would come here to train physically - athletes training their muscles in higher gravity would make exceptional leaps over those that don't. In return, economic prosperity and perhaps unique items of our own that can withstand this environment. We'd like assurances that this peace is a binding one, and that honoring our contracts won't leave us at a loss.""

Ah'nuriel cocked her head slightly. ""Perhaps that is a question better answered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.""

""Come now, Undersecretary. A meeting with the Foreign Affairs department would leave me with bland reassurance no matter the truth in addition to my already aching knees. I seek the honesty that only comes from a balance sheet. In addition, I understand that you have something of a personal stake in continued peace.""

Her fur flared almost of its own volition. ""That information is...accurate. But not quite relevant.""

""On this, we must agree to disagree - risk assessment requires accurate information, and a great deal of detail. With that said, here is some information that I have from Terran companies."" Agent Smith slid a small datapad over. ""Those are the companies willing to invest, and the amounts they are willing to pay at this time. They are substantial, and with assurances of security could grow. Which would mean the amounts they pay us would grow, and everyone goes home happy. Of course I would ensure my superiors knew your name in my reports. So, information for information. There's no reason to say yes or no right now - my superiors are arranging a conference at our offices in New Casablanca in a few months, and we are making an attendee list right now. Purely speculative for the moment, but I'm sure if I polled your co-workers right now there would be several interested parties. With the right voices in the right ears, a great deal can change. A captain could have a name, for example.""

Ah'nuriel nodded reluctant agreement. ""Information for information, then.""

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk's life had never been so busy. There had been a few days of respite as his ship and crew had celebrated and enjoyed a fine night at Sparrows, and then began the process of correcting and implementing new things that their victory had allowed the company to purchase. Inertial dampeners, a secondary shielding system, some additional systems for weapons, new paint, and what may have been most important, a new coffee maker for Engineering. For himself and the bridge team, however, it meant exceptionally long days in a command simulator, where they'd been run through multiple engagements and tactical sequences. After each engagement, the proctors from the 7th would go over everyone's errors in excruciating detail. The proctors were dark magicians at finding errors - even when they'd run through simulated exercises perfectly, there was still a detail that had been overlooked, a way it could have been done better. He'd lost the entire ship on several occasions, which unnerved him as the proctors went over every failing he'd had during those engagements. It was disheartening until O'Brien had finally told the proctors to give them the room. In the conference room over tea, coffee, and foul language they finally were able to gain a sense of what was happening; each simulation was meant to test a specific aspect of their skills, and in the portions they were looking at, Gryzzk and the rest of the crew had performed admirably. Within the rest of it was dressing for them to find mistakes and play headgames - O'Brien pointed out two specific instances where Gryzzk had done something, been called out for it, and then did as they suggested and still merited a chewing out. Things seemed to go better somehow after that, with them acting and reacting to things with a bit less tension.

All of that meant precious little time with his wife and children. He'd had a chance to watch the news a bit more, and it seemed as if every day there was something new that made him feel as if his company was falling behind on a tally sheet that existed only in his mind. Even the Swords of the Light Gods had taken on a successful job – a passenger escort run between New Casablanca and Vilantia. It nagged at him until after three weeks he sent a terse voice message to the Major advising that he was going to stand the company down for a week to assess their next steps prior to their next job.

The reply message was a soft chuckle and a ""Your company, your rules.""

His delivery of the news at the morning briefing was met with relief and cheers from the crew. As much as they would have kept going for a few more weeks if he'd asked, Gryzzk had observed the Terrans seemed to believe that making time for family and new friends was important – perhaps that was one of their secrets.

They finished up the day's work and Gryzzk found himself on the couch at the end of the day as the children all took spots, with Nhoot staying close to Gryzzk and Gro'zel staying closer to her mother, while the twins took their place in the middle of all of them. Gryzzk frowned a bit as the mercenary news of the day was a re-enactment of the Sword's second engagement - a battle against a Throne's Fortune base which left Gryzzk talking to the wallscreen - only to have his opinions confirmed by the commentators. The Swords seemed to be taking every opportunity to simply overwhelm with force and then destroy even when it would have been more profitable to disable and take the ships whole; particularly since the Hurdop government had formally disavowed the Throne's Fortune as a renegade element and confirmed that there would be a bounty paid for proof in the form of letters of marque.

One of commentators was blunt. ""It's like they're a bully who got beaten and tries to prove they aren't weak by picking on the ones they know don't have a shot. If this is an advert for their skills, I dunno who's buying...""

The one bonus of the arrival of the Swords was that more Vilantian shows were available; the family sat and watched a few classic comedy shows and smiled appropriately, but something seemed off about them. Perhaps it was the time, but the jokes didn't make either of them laugh like they used to.

Still, they went to bed and the next day they took one of the shuttles to New Casablanca. Not the bar district, but the more family-friendly shopping district, filled with temporary stalls dotting the more permanent structures where a dazzling array of goods from Terra could be purchased. While Gryzzk only kept his rank tab on himself for emergency communications, the girls had refused to leave until their purple berets were on their head with their rank proudly placed. Grezzk took the lead, finding a small area of shops that had started to stock items from the Vilantian homeworld. Grezzk took the opportunity to pay a shameful price for some foodstuffs and a few small items that reminded them of home.

Once outside, several Vilantians were waiting, their scent an undisguised disgust. They wore the gold and black uniforms of the Swords company with ranks that designated them as senior staff – all in all this did not bode well.

""Nameless captain, step forth. We do not wish to harm you. We bear a message from the Minister of War.""

Gryzzk closed one pair of his eyes for a moment. ""I recall Commodore A'Drapir's message quite well, friends - may the dead gods treat him well.""

""I do not recall Commodore A'Drapir being named Minister of War. The Minister himself has an offer. He sees that you have become something unexpected; and with that he offers his voice in Restoration and a role within the Swords of the Light Gods. Your own ship, your own crew consisting of the finest Vilantians from Clan Aa'Porti. Picked soldiers to do your bidding – if you do his bidding. The Clan Way calls to you. Your Great Lord calls to you. The Minister would have your voice in the future of Vilantia. Answer yes with your full voice, and all this-"" there was a vague gesture to their surroundings ""-can be a forgotten memory.""

There was a pause ""What future would that be?""

""A future where the Clan Way is made truth and the worlds of this sector are held to it.""

Gryzzk closed his remaining eyes, knowing that what he was going to say would probably condemn him in the eyes of at least three Ministers. ""Not long ago, the Clan Way was the only way I knew. But there is a better way. Clans built not by a birth more than thirty generations past, but choice. My clan is young, built on those the Clan Way would have us cast aside, ignore, and condemn. If we win victory, we learn. If we are defeated, we do not pretend it didn't happen. This offer would have suited me once. But it does not suit me now. When I walk from the twilight, it will be on my own feet with a clan of Vilantians, Hurdop, and Terrans at my side.""

The disgust and fury in their scent made the girls recoil behind Grezzk, and finally one of them spat at the ground. ""None who dwell in the twilight may pass judgment on those in the light. Minister Aa'tebul will lend his voice to more worthy causes. We will not fight this day."" So saying, they spun and walked away with precision.

Grezzk swallowed, and both Gro'zel and Nhoot came out from behind Grezzk. Grezzk had a slight smirk on her face.

""Lord A'Gryzzk, we must make another child soon."" She leaned into him warmly for a moment before they began walking to the shuttle with their purchases.

""I'm no lord. I just do what's best for my family and those under my command.""

""And those under your command would call you a Lord.""

""You realize that would make you a Lady, correct?""

""It would – but only because you shine so brightly.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't like it. A Lord is born a Lord, and I was not born such."" Still, there was anxiety. He'd effectively become a lord by the acclaim of those he commanded, and even prior to that with managing Lord A'kifab's household. But to become a lord seemed almost insulting in some way.

There was a bit of consideration and silence before Gryzzk caught a familiar scent and turned to call out. ""Edwards?""

Edwards stepped from around a market stall – she was wearing a set of hooded grey robes that covered her almost head to toe. She looked a bit embarrassed, but smiled. ""Gonna have to wear perfume next time. Ugh.""

""Why?""

""Hiding my scent, obviously."" She shrugged. ""So what'd those bumblebees want?""

""They wanted me to come work for them.""

Edwards blinked. ""Oh. You, ah, thinkin' about it?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No. I have a clan already, as you recall.""

Edwards seemed relieved. ""Okay, cool. Yeah, that must have been hard.""

""Not as much as I thought it would. I have something meaningful here, and we have agreed to things. Together. They did not wish to include anyone else. But we have a conundrum of sorts."" Gryzzk paused to consider how to couch the question. ""Titles are important to us. Lead Servant, Lord, Greatlord, things like that. Does Terran or Hurdop culture have a title that fits this situation that we're in?""

Edwards chuffed softly. ""Whatcha mean?""

""Well essentially a commoner in what is traditionally a noble position.""

""Oh yeah, your captains are...but not really for the Hurdop...sorta."" Edwards' eyes unfocused as she seemed to be reading a tablet from her memory and she started thinking out loud. ""But...Samoan - Matai, no. Feudal Japan - Jizamurai, maybe but we'll keep going...Nordic - Jarl - nah too close to earl and they'd call me out for playing too much Skyrim again..."" Finally she snapped back to reality. ""I'll have to think about it. I'll talk to Engineering but we might just need to invent a new word for you, Cap.""

""Indeed. If it comes to that let me know. Now, to the other question I have – why were you following me?""

Edwards looked like a child about to get disciplined for marking the walls. ""Well, respectfully Cap, you've made some enemies. Bad Moon's put money on the board for an asskicking with you as the recipient, and few of the Swords were making noises about bringing you into the light according to Reilly.""

""How does Reilly know?""

""She bought 'em a couple drinks. Apparently we all look alike to you.""

""Remind me to compensate her.""

""She said she'll trade the drinks for a refresh on her roots from Mama Grezzk."" Edwards smirked a little.

Grezzk seemed taken aback slightly. ""Mama?""

There was a nod. ""Mmm-hm. On the ship Nhoot calls him Captain Papa, so Mama just kinda grew out of that.""

Grezzk's fur flickered. ""I. I hadn't considered that. Of course, we'll be here whenever she wishes."" She paused for a moment. ""Let her know that tonight we're having a garlic chicken recipe for dinner.""

They shuttled back to the company area and split off; Edwards heading to her room in the barracks and Gryzzk leading his family to their quarters. Gryzzk settled in on the couch with the boys and checked his tablet while the girls ran to their room to play with their new toys. Grezzk began marinating the chicken and preparing the rice before settling in on the couch.

""You don't like the idea of being a Lord, do you?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""It feels wrong, somehow.""

She leaned into him gently. ""Whatever they call you, you will always be my handsome hand.""

For a long moment, there was a bubble of peace as the universe shrank to a small officer's quarters with girls playing and giggling, two boys cradled between their parents, and the parents enjoying the opportunity to stare at a hologram of a Vilantian sunset.

The silence couldn't last forever, and there was a chime at the door. It was Reilly, grinning happily with a small case filled with hair colors. Gryzzk put the boys in their beds as Grezzk lowered the gravity to match the ship standard before opening the door. Reilly came in and was promptly greeted by Nhoot and Gro'zel who simply had to show off their new toys. There was some general laughter and amusement as Reilly nuzzled Grezzk's neck briefly and then sneezed.

Reilly was bouncing a little bit and seemed to almost be everywhere at once, dipping a finger in the marinade and pronouncing it to be 'zippy', and then looking at the twins and ooh'ing and sniffing them delicately so as not to wake them. After that she was teaching the girls to dance. Oddly. Finally she flopped on the couch and tapped on Gryzzk's tablet.

""You didn't read the message I sent, Cap?""

Gryzzk quirked at her. ""I didn't yet.""

""Stuff's happening. Got a lead on a new job outta Hurdop Prime, and the news is going to be interesting tonight.""

The new information was accepted casually, and Gryzzk took his tablet back for more information on the job. It appeared to be a specific request from a new Hurdop trading company called the Great Triangle of Hurdop. The job itself seemed simple; escorting a pair of ships from Hurdop Prime to Terra Prime, then to Vilantia prime, and finally a return to Hurdop Prime. It seemed simple enough, but at the same time it was concerning. He looked at the pay for the job before forwarding it to Rosie with an inquiry if they could add about five percent more and stipulate payment for hazards and combat.

Rosie agreed, and they sent an amended version of the request back to the Great Triangle.

Dinner was a raucous affair, as Reilly told jokes and stories about how Gryzzk was aboard the ship. Finally as they cleaned up, the twins began to stir for their food, and Reilly was polite enough to wait that out while they watched the news. The mercenary-focused section was as interesting as Reilly had promised.

""...and in new stand-ups, we've got a few. Bad Moon Company has announced the formation of a new associate company, the Foreign Legion of Terra. This comes on the heels of Swissguards press release regarding their own Terran Legion of Foreigners and - oooh, here's a little outside the box thinking - Polar Bear Company's rolling out the Foreign Terran Legion. Funnily enough, they're all rocking shades of purple for their colors. Great marketing teams out there."" The announcer shook his head and turn to his co-anchor for more commentary while Reilly began laughing so hard tears were forming.

""Oh. My God."" Reilly wheezed. ""This is awesome.""

""I'm not sure I understand."" Gryzzk tried to focus on the commentators, who seemed pessimistic - they agreed that the 7th Cavalry had caught some manner of lightning in a bottle with the 'OG Terran Foreign Legion', but whether that success could be replicated was an entirely different manner.

Reilly giggled a little bit more before gathering herself and quoting from a movie that Gryzzk vaguely remembered. ""It's like that thing - 'Are you the Judean People's Front?' 'Fuck off! Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea!' It's hilarious, we're so good we've already got knockoffs.""

Grezzk finally got the twins resettled and changed for bed, and came out to get Reilly's hair color refreshed properly. It was an odd thing to watch, as Grezzk and Reilly chatted amiably about things - Reilly was enthralled by certain aspects of Vilantia, and made casual allusions to shore leave and possibly even vacationing there when the chance came. Finally with her hair color re-purpled and ends re-done, Reilly took her leave.

""I do believe we're going to have to ask your bosses to look at the applications you forwarded sooner rather than later."" Grezzk smiled softly.

""Mmm. Probably. We'll need to avoid damage on this next job.""

""Worry about that on the next job. I would have my handsome hand warm our bed tonight.""

Gryzzk smiled a bit himself as he led his wife to a good night's sleep."

Throwing a Princess Party in Las Vegas: Your Go-To Guide,u_Jinanlee,1i8tfqx,2025-01-24 06:37:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jinanlee/comments/1i8tfqx/throwing_a_princess_party_in_las_vegas_your_goto/,Jinanlee,,"Las Vegas is known for its glitter, glam, and endless possibilities. But did you know it’s also the perfect place to throw a magical princess party for your little one? From enchanting decorations to exciting activities, planning a memorable royal celebration is easier than you might think. Whether you're hosting at home or booking a venue, here’s your ultimate guide to creating a fairy-tale experience in the Entertainment Capital of the World.

# 1. Choose a Theme That Sparks Joy

Every princess has her unique story, and your party should reflect the one your child loves most. Popular themes include classic fairy-tale royalty, enchanted forests, or even a magical ball. Decorate the space with colors that match the theme—think pastel pinks, purples, or shimmering golds—and add royal touches like tiaras, wands, and banners.

Want to take it up a notch? Incorporate castles, glittering chandeliers, and princess figurines into your decor to transport guests straight to a magical kingdom.

# 2. Invitations Fit for Royalty

Set the tone with invitations that excite your little guests. Go for a creative design, like scrolls tied with ribbons or castle-shaped cards. Be sure to include key details like the date, time, location, and whether guests should arrive dressed in their favorite princess attire.

For a personal touch, let your child help choose or decorate the invitations. This small involvement will make them feel even more special.

# 3. The Perfect Venue for a Princess Party

When it comes to venues, Las Vegas offers endless options to match your vision. You can transform your home into a castle or rent a location like a park or banquet hall. Many parents choose indoor venues for added convenience, especially during the warmer months.

For outdoor parties, consider a garden setting with fairy lights and floral decorations to create a dreamy atmosphere. Just remember to have a backup plan in case of unpredictable weather!

# 4. Dress-Up Corner: A Royal Experience

Nothing makes kids feel like royalty quite like dressing the part. Set up a dress-up station where guests can choose from princess dresses, tiaras, jewelry, and even royal capes. Provide mirrors and let the little ones transform themselves into their favorite characters.

This not only gets everyone in the party spirit but also doubles as a fun activity that keeps kids entertained for hours.

# 5. Activities and Entertainment for the Little Royals

Every princess party needs enchanting activities to keep the kids engaged. Here are some ideas that are sure to bring smiles:

* **Storytime with a Fairy-Tale Book**: Read classic princess stories to captivate the children.
* **Crown and Tiara Decorating**: Provide craft supplies like glitter, stickers, and gems so kids can design their own accessories.
* **Princess Dance Party**: Play magical soundtracks and let the kids show off their moves in a royal ball setting.

If you’re looking to wow your guests, consider hiring entertainers to bring the princess experience to life. A professional ""princess"" who sings, dances, and interacts with the kids can make the day even more magical.

# 6. A Royal Feast Fit for Princesses

Delight your guests with a menu that feels both fun and luxurious. Mini sandwiches, bite-sized pastries, and colorful fruit platters are perfect for a tea-party vibe.

Don’t forget the sweets! A princess-themed cake, cupcakes with tiara toppers, and sugar cookies shaped like crowns or castles are sure to be a hit. For drinks, serve pink lemonade, fruit punch, or “magic potions” in elegant cups.

# 7. Decor That Brings the Magic to Life

The decorations set the stage for your princess party. Think balloons, banners, and lots of sparkle! Here are some decoration ideas to make the event unforgettable:

* **Throne Chair**: Set up a special seat for the birthday child, complete with a crown and a velvet cape.
* **Backdrop for Photos**: Create a photo area with glittering curtains, floral arches, or a cardboard castle.
* **Table Settings**: Use gold or silver tableware, fairy-tale centerpieces, and themed plates to elevate the experience.

# 8. Party Favors to Remember

Send your little guests home with a piece of the magic! Favors can include mini tiaras, wands, or princess-themed goodie bags filled with stickers, candies, and small toys. These keepsakes will remind them of the fun long after the party ends.

# 9. Capture the Magic

Don’t forget to document the day! Whether you hire a professional photographer or snap photos yourself, capturing the smiles, laughter, and magical moments is a must. A princess party is a memory that you and your child will cherish forever.

# 10. Wrap It Up with a Princess Finale

End the party with a special finale that leaves everyone enchanted. This could be a princess parade, where the kids walk the “royal red carpet,” or a magical storytime session where everyone gathers around to hear one last fairy tale.

Plan the Ultimate Princess Party in AZ with These Fun Ideas,u_erepresent,1i8sh7a,2025-01-24 05:30:44,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i8sh7a/plan_the_ultimate_princess_party_in_az_with_these/,erepresent,,"Throwing a magical princess party in Arizona is the ultimate way to make your little one’s special day unforgettable! Whether you’re celebrating a birthday or just creating a day full of enchanting memories, a princess-themed party is the perfect way to bring fairy tales to life. From charming decorations to engaging activities, here are some fun and creative ideas to plan the ultimate **princess party AZ**.

# 1. Set the Scene with Royal Decorations

Transform your party space into a royal palace fit for a princess. Start with a color palette featuring pastel pinks, purples, gold, and silver. Use shimmering tablecloths, elegant chair covers, and plenty of glittery accents to create a magical atmosphere.

Add balloon arches, streamers, and fairy lights to enhance the ambiance. Create a princess-worthy backdrop for photos, such as a castle wall or enchanted forest scene. Don’t forget to include a throne or royal chair for the birthday princess—it’s her day to shine!

# 2. Send Royal Invitations

Set the tone for your party with royal-themed invitations. You can opt for scroll-shaped invites or designs that mimic the look of royal decrees. Make sure to include all the details in a fun, princess-inspired way, such as “Join us in the Kingdom of \[Your Child’s Name\] to celebrate her special day!”

Encourage guests to arrive dressed as their favorite princess or prince for the full experience.

# 3. Offer Princess-Themed Costumes

Every child dreams of dressing up as royalty, so provide costumes or accessories to bring the theme to life. You can set up a “Royal Wardrobe” area with tiaras, crowns, tutus, and capes for guests to wear during the party.

You could even make this a party activity where kids decorate their own tiaras or wands. This will give them a keepsake to take home while adding to the festive fun.

# 4. Plan Magical Activities and Games

Keep the little ones entertained with fun, princess-inspired activities. Some popular options include:

* **Crown Decorating:** Provide foam crowns, glitter glue, stickers, and gemstones for kids to design their own crowns.
* **Fairy Tale Storytime:** Have a parent, older sibling, or a hired entertainer read classic princess stories.
* **Princess Parade:** Let the kids showcase their costumes with a parade to royal music.
* **Treasure Hunt:** Organize a scavenger hunt where children search for royal treasures hidden around the party area.

These activities will keep the party exciting while giving kids an opportunity to immerse themselves in the magical theme.

# 5. Serve a Princess-Worthy Menu

No princess party is complete without a royal feast! Offer kid-friendly treats like finger sandwiches, fruit wands, and cupcakes topped with edible glitter. For drinks, serve “magic potions” (juice or lemonade) in fancy cups or goblets.

For the cake, consider a stunning princess-themed design, such as a castle, tiara, or even a dress-shaped cake. The cake is often the centerpiece of the party, so don’t be afraid to go all out!

# 6. Create a Princess Photo Booth

Set up a whimsical photo booth where kids can capture their royal moment. Include props like crowns, feather boas, magic wands, and royal scepters. Use a themed backdrop, like a castle or enchanted forest, to make the photos even more special.

Make sure you take plenty of pictures to share with the parents after the party. These snapshots will be treasured keepsakes of a day filled with magic.

# 7. Incorporate Princess Music and Dancing

Add a little extra magic with a royal dance party! Create a playlist featuring classic princess songs from movies and let the kids dance to their hearts’ content. You can even hire a DJ or rent a speaker to create the ultimate fairy tale ball.

For a special touch, consider teaching the kids a simple royal waltz or organizing a dance-off. It’s a great way to get everyone moving and having fun!

# 8. Give Royal Party Favors

End the party on a high note by giving each child a little piece of magic to take home. Some ideas for princess-themed party favors include:

* Mini tiaras or crowns
* Magic wands
* Glittery bracelets or necklaces
* Personalized “royal scrolls” thanking them for attending

Wrap the favors in glittery bags or boxes to make them even more enchanting.

# 9. Keep It Simple with a Princess Party Package

If you’re short on time or prefer to let the experts handle the details, you can book a princess party package. Look for local options in Arizona that provide decorations, activities, and even costumed performers to make your event stress-free and magical.

# 10. Capture the Magical Moments

Don’t forget to document the day! Take plenty of photos and videos throughout the event to capture the joy on everyone’s faces. You can even create a photo album or slideshow to look back on the special day.

# Plan Your Perfect Princess Party in AZ

Creating problems where there were none,AsianParentStories,1i8s227,2025-01-24 05:00:16,23,0.96,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1i8s227/creating_problems_where_there_were_none/,Superb-Salad6323,Rant/Vent,"Every now and then I remember this shit my APs would pull on me and I get really fucking mad so I decided to rant about it here.

So meals were always self-serve. I would get my own bowl of rice and then take food from the dishes in the middle of the table. I would only take the amount that I could finish. Then my APs would pull the classic ""eat more"" and shove more food into my bowl. I had a small appetite and physically could not finish all of the food in my bowl. Then they would scream at me, berating me for being wasteful and ungrateful because of a problem that THEY CAUSED. 

I would just sit there sobbing while they hurled insults at me. I would get a whole speech about how they worked so hard to put food on the table and I didn't appreciate it, which made me extremely guilty. And this would happen multiple times. I tried so hard to finish everything they gave me and they already knew I had a small appetite. So I didn't understand why they weren't putting two and two together and realizing that I wasn't being a spoiled brat, I was just so full that I physically couldn't eat anymore.

I couldn't talk back to them back then, but some part of me thought that if I could explain that I wasn't doing it on purpose they would stop yelling at me. But now I see that they had a lot of stress at the time because of work and would take it out on me while hiding behind plausible excuses. And food waste is a very good excuse, since it's one of the biggest sins in Asian culture. So for a long time I really believed that I was a selfish, ungrateful piece of shit like they told me I was. It took a long time for me to see that it was just one-sided bullying by shitty adults against a child that could not fight back.

When I had to eat with them I started taking only 1/2 to 1/4 of what I would normally eat or hiding food in my mouth to spit out later in the toilet. So ironically I was wasting food to avoid being yelled at about wasting food. I dreaded dinnertime and associated meals with emotions of anger, confusion, resentment, and hurt.

I had problems with food and self-worth because of them. I used to skip meals because I thought I didn't deserve to eat, then cave when I couldn't stand the hunger, then feel guilty for eating, and then repeat this process over and over again. I would avoid buying fresh vegetables because I remember my AM yelling at me when vegetables in the fridge went bad after not being eaten, even though my APs are the ones who control what groceries are bought and what is being cooked, but she still decided it was my fault of course. There was a period of time where I was living off of one packet of ramen a day, not because I was poor or lazy, but because I felt like I was undeserving of real home cooked meals or multiple meals a day. I'm doing better now and actually cooking, but I still get a twinge of fear when I see that there are leftovers. But then I just saran wrap it and move on with my day like my APs should have done."

Misunderstood what area was considered my bikini line @ first laser hair removal session,TwoXChromosomes,1i8oji2,2025-01-24 00:42:02,1935,0.92,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1i8oji2/misunderstood_what_area_was_considered_my_bikini/,enolypepsi,,"So I had a consultation before signing up for this… I said I wanted my “bikini line” treated. Cool. Sounds like we understood each other. My consult person says “do you want classic bikini line- like just the sides- or do you want the top too?” I clarify- “just the sides” and both of us are doing hand gestures that allude to little strips of hair on two sides of something okay- she tells me to prepare by shaving the area, I hate doing that so much but I do it for the best results-

I show up today for my first session. Laser tech and nurse practitioner are in the room.  I wanted NP to check out a cyst really quick just to make sure it’s all safe to continue around it. She says, right before she’s about to check it out, “you can leave your underwear on” to which I say “I didn’t even wear any because I figured the area would be too sensitive leaving here” she’s so nice, grabs a towel for me to put around me, I can’t even figure out how to properly wrap myself in that because I’m so embarrassed, so I just hold on to it and go ahead and show her the bump- all 3 of us looking at my vagina rn, okay whatever that’s what we’re here to do, the bump is fine to work around she declares, and we’re off to the actual laser work.

I spread my legs, still no underwear, and she goes “do you even grow hair here?”, I sit up and look at myself, I say “well I shaved but yes I do” and she understands then that we are looking at different parts. She says “this is the bikini line, did you know that?” As she waves her hand on basically my upper thigh…. Of course I didn’t sister. Of course I didn’t. 

I thought it was the outline of my entire vaginal package. 

She agrees to do that area anyway and I’m so thankful for that. As I am leaving she says  “you could probably just wear a thong next time” - I’m in shock still that I didn’t realize the area I had agreed to be treated and that that area alone wasn’t a thing really- wasn’t a designated zone they treated.

Ladies. Is the bikini line common knowledge? Did everyone know it was basically upper inner thigh and not the pit of your pussy crevices? I feel so ashamed

H. and 212g / 7.47 oz and the website says 90mm/3.54 inches W x 258mm/10.15 inches and 255g/9 ounces. This probably reflects measuring with the titanium cup or plastic cap, and with or without the neoprene cozy and shoulder strap.

**\*\*\* ULTRALIGHT SHELTER & QUILTS \*\*\***

**1) Liteway Pyraomm Max Ultralight 4-5P Pyramid Tent (European MLD Supermid), Gray, New (set up only once), $319 (Regularly $400-410). Specs and more photos** [**here**](https://liteway.equipment/pyraomm-max/pyraomm-max-tarp). Liteway sells the tarp for $410 (379 Euros) with very long shipping times to the US. MLD sells the Supermid for $385 + $13 shipping + tax and lead times are typically 10-12 weeks that are often pushed way back. Get your Pyaraomm Max / Supermid now. Extremely well-made bomber pyramid shelter, a palace for 1 or 2, or 2 plus bikes, generous for 3, and able to accommodate 4-5. Sheds wind far better than double trekking pole shelters. Stellar in winter when you can dig down into the snow for lots of extra space, and for creating seating and a sleep bench. Gray is the best all around color - it’s a good stealth color and keeps the light inside the tent neutral and easy on your eyes for reading, and doesn’t attract bugs like yellow and orange do.

**2) Liteway Equipment Ultralight Down Sleeper Quilt 870 FP (Fill Power), 10D (Denier), 28F / -2°C, Medium, Black, New with Tag, $189 (Regularly $313 + shipping).

Comfort temp of 28 F (-2 °C). Natural down 870 Fill Power with Hydrophobic treatment to protect down from moisture and maintain warm loft in humid conditions. Goose down 80%, duck down 20% (90% down, 10% feather). 10D Nylon with DWR water-resistant coating. High quality YKK zippers and fasteners. Compacts small for easy packing. Size Medium: length 190 cm / 75in, width at the shoulders 140cm / 55in, width at the feet 105cm / 42in. Weight in UL mesh sack with pad straps and tag on my scale: only 535g (1 lb 2.9 oz).

**\*\*\* ULTRALIGHT BACKPACKS, FASTPACKS & STORAGE SACK \*\*\***

**1) Gossamer Gear Fast Kumo 36L S/M, New,** **$135 (Regularly $190 + tax) -** The well-thought-out fastpack version of the popular Kumo 36L with wide, very comfortable vest shoulder straps and roomy shoulder pockets with plenty of storage. Foam backpack doubles as a sit pad. Makes a great day pack or fast weekend pack. Sizing: **S/M** fits 14"" - 20"" torso. Fastpacks are more stable for moving fast when they sit higher on the back. If you're in between sizes, you will want to: Size down for more of a shoulder wrap and higher hipbelt, and Size up for a lower hipbelt fit. An example: The S/M is a great fit on a friend with a 19 in. torso and an athletic slim build (not barrel-chested or large-shouldered for which you might want to go M/L). [**Photos here**](https://imgur.com/a/iBaxb6x)**. Video**[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGD_uH1ISZY).

**2) Granite Gear Crown 2 38L, Unisex Regular, Orange, New, $129 (Crown 3 40 regularly 239.95 + tax) IYKYK!** A very comfortable, lightweight, durable and versatile pack at a great value. The Crown 2 38L is the perfect size for those who have their kit dialed in, and thanks to the excellent compression and lashing points it’s also the perfect size for a technical day pack for 3 seasons and winter, a daypack, or when you need to carry some things for friends or family members. This orange color is a big safety boost during winter and hunting season.[ **Photos here**.](https://imgur.com/a/iUcqn06)

Size goes by measurement around the widest part of the chest, the range is 36 in. to 48 in. and the pack is highly adjustable so you can dial it right in. The women's backpanel is only 1/2 in. narrower than the men's, so will fit men too.

Same as above Crown in Women’s fit, which will also fit men and male teens with slightly narrower shoulders well too. Black color blends in well locally for travel and hides stains and dirt.[ **Photos here.**](https://imgur.com/a/0wSLthX)

**5) Hillsound Weatherproof Packstack Pro Storage Sack, 40L Tall, New in packaging, $25** (regularly $35) weatherproof storage sack that made Outside Magazine's Gear Guide Editor's Choice Award. **Specs**[ here](https://hillsound.com/products/packstackpro).

Ombraz ingenious ultralight sunglasses use adjustable cords instead of arms, which are the part that most often breaks. The cords keep the sunglasses secure on your head no matter how you move. Comfortable both with and without helmets, while helmets can push on the arms of typical sunglasses, making them uncomfortable, lifting the frames off your face and potentially breaking the arms when you bump against something.

Also, non-polarized lenses provide better depth perception and allow you to identify potentially dangerous, slick wet or icy patches on snow and on roads, essential for skiing, snowshoeing, cycling and driving. Non-polarized lenses also provide better visibility in overcast conditions.[ **Photos link.**](https://imgur.com/a/M9RXkKg)

an abnimals recap that libertarian travis would insist is old enough to date,TAZCirclejerk,1i8hw5z,2025-01-23 18:54:46,103,0.96,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1i8hw5z/an_abnimals_recap_that_libertarian_travis_would/,weedshrek,,"heyy pervies. we're back. this one is late because i took my precious son shampoo to the vet. he's doing great, this was just an adoption followup that got pushed back twice by the doctor. this one is called cell block wango bango tango which is TECHNICALLY i guess wordplay since i think wango bango tango is a roger move

i'm reading this episode description and i called it. i fucking called it. they're going to meet defeated npcs in the holding cells and the npcs are going to help them because travis cannot let anyone be bad (kids love redemption arcs! remember zuko from avatar??) and also despite the fact that holding cells are a very specific form of temporary holding and not the same thing as fucking prison. i haven't even hit play yet and im annoyed. fantastic. no one is doing it like the mcelroys.

* song, etc and so on and so forth
* WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY IS THE EVIDENCE ROOM THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO THE HOLDING CELLS WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM
* travis is roleplaying with himself fantastic
* i hate travis mcelroy. to any other sub people here looking for evidence: this is not a bit. i hate this man. if i say otherwise elsewhere i am lying for the purpose of winning an internet argument this guy sucks
* he's having everyone in the party roll (""let's see....you have advantage here...you're hiding and darnet is covering for you..."") 4d8, because sometimes dice tell the story, and the story is i want you to succeed here but i'm shackled by the constraints of ""gameplay"" so let me just juice your roll enough that statistically at least one of you will pass and since this is still dnd no matter how many things i change, i will ignore the other rolls even though thats now how the fucking game i made works
* justin is rolling 7d8 for some reason who cares
* griffin insisting that /roll 7d8 is ""not how computers work"" because lest anyone forget, he is also a mcelroy and therefore terminally confident in his own stupidity. there is no cure.
* ""i rolled four failures. which is another name for this podcast"" - griffin andrew mcelroy
* travis is assigning a damage point to lyle because travis had one of his npcs kick lyle's box to indicate how messy the room is. at this point it should be noted that justin is the only person in the entire group to roll full success on this roll
* he's sooooooo snide about it too. 'because you got kicked in a box' shut the fuck up travis
* to reiterate again, griffin got a full failure, clint go a mixed, and justin got a full success. the series of consequences from those rolls were:
   * justin took 1 damage
   * clint got another box stacked on top of the box he's in
   * nothing happens to griffin
* chat we are saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaur close to travis just reading his shitty novel while rachel adds a dice roll sound every 3 minutes in post
* oh this episode is extra stupid because why is goshua giving them carver lore from ""the forums"" regarding this unaired pilot when seal is also an established superfan. any child could have figured out you just use seal to relay the info by saying ""seal, as a superfan you know this about the unaired pilot"" and then telling the party
* i'm serious an eight year old could do a better job than travis shithead mcelroy
* ok no seriously who did justin talk to that helped him realize this is all make believe and you can just say things into existence, because travis is trying to do his dumbass dripfeed of information again (walter walrus is here talking to gold seal and goshua claims the cctv has no sound, and justin is like ""the sound button is right there"" -- to which there's a pause and then goshua says ""i don't know how to use this system"" as travis utilizes that patented mcelroy improv technique), because i love it, but also its been over a decade of playing ttrpgs and this is a realization that, again, a child could make within the first two hours of playing one of these
* griffin: can i sneak back in, because i am dying to know what my dad is saying
* travis: well, why don't you, roger, try to see if you can figure out the \[surveillance\] system using your hack
* no one is doing it like the mcelroys
* this is fucking unbelievable. this feels fucking malicious. he asks clint to get out of the box to hack, when clint agrees, he calls for a 2d8 roll (what happened to those arbitrarily beefed up rolls earlier bud?) because of the boxes on top of the box roger is in. clint succeeds, so **lyle** manages to catch the boxes so they don't make a big commotion. travis:
   * compelled a player to make an action
   * directly tried to punished that player for that action
   * gave the success that player rolled to another player to resolve it
   * on top of being stupid as fuck because lyle and seal aren't in their boxes anymore and would have just removed the stacked boxes for roger, the same way you don't have to declare every time your character breathes
* ?????????????????????????
* walter and gold are saying some cryptic bullshit it isn't important because travis thought it up, but then walter excuses himself to walk over to a computer to type something in, which causes the evidence room to go into lockdown
   * for anyone that isn't travis mcelroy, i might put in the effort to no prize this by the fact that its been established this is a private company, and walter is a billionaire and probably owns them, but since they can't remember that fact, i refuse to grant them that grace why the FUCK is walter allowed to do this
   * two, WHAT COMPUTER!!!!! WHERE THE FUCK IS GOLDEN SEAL!!!!!!! because for awhile he was left in the lobby, where the only computer at the front desk is SMASHED, and then for a bit next episode he was left by the bathroom, which i have no idea where that is in relation to anything else, and the presumably last episode he was back in the lobby where the COMPUTER WAS SMASHED
   * i was going to hold out on asking why the fuck he would place the evidence room into lockdown, but of course travis does not explain. based on context i think the implication is that golden told walter about what the other three were doing, but why the FUCK would you not just make that explicit info they know so that these actions MAKE SENSE instead of asking for idiot ass rolls to give them half audio that doesn't say ANYTHING i HATE this man
* oh my fucking god this is the most perfect game ever created, the lockdown ONLY LOCKS THE DOOR LEADING BACK TO THE BULLPEN, it leaves the DOOR OF THE EVIDENCE ROOM CONNECTED TO THE HOLDING CELLS WHERE THEY KEEP CRIMINALS UNLOCKED
* COME ON
* SERIOUSLY YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER
* THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK!!!!!!!!
* here watch, i'm going to come up with a less stupid reason they have to move forward instead of back in the world's shittiest 5 room dungeon off the top of my head: a cop is in the stairwell making a call to his girlfriend on his lunch break and he's going to be there for at least the next hour
* ""clamgela is sort of like a go-between person for supervillains"" travis sure as fuck talks good
* to avoid suspicion, goshua opts to get shocked by roger. ""well since he isn't trying to avoid it, give me a 4d8 roll"" like honestly go fuck yourself
* oh my fucking god its only been 17 minutes
* travis, literally 5 minutes ago: we're pretty full up \[in the holding cells\]
* travis, just now: of the 16 cells, 8 are occupied
* and yeah. of course. its the people they've defeated so far. arty ficial is here, despite the fact that barker/lovelace collected him at the end of that fight to bugfix him so it makes no fucking sense that he'd be in a holding cell
* we have another certified Travis Woman Character(tm) in the cell, some poison ivy rip off. clint calls her ""cabbage patch kid"" and then griffin says ""no, i mean, we can clearly see that there's a name there"" and travis adds ""its a very good name, everyone agrees""
   * actually physically unsure if this was griffin trying to make sure travis got credit for the name cabbage patch kid, or if there is a second, unrelated pun-name on roll20 and none of these fuckers said it out loud despite referencing it
* yeah of course all the cell doors unlock. to remind everyone at home, because the mcelroys have already forgotten, there is inexplicable direct access to the evidence room from these cells. and all of them know it because they are ESCORTED THROUGH THE EVIDENCE ROOM when they are deposited in the cells
* AND THESE DOORS CONNECTING THE HOLDING CELLS TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM DO NOT LOCK WHEN A LOCKDOWN ON THE EVIDENCE ROOM IS CALLED, A LOCKDOWN SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS COPS FROM GETTING TO THE HOLDING CELLS AND EVIDENCE ROOM WHEN IT IS INITIATED
* NO ONE
* IS DOING IT
* LIKE

* ah poison ivy is named chlora phyllis
* the cabbage patch kid is a better name

* it still isn't funny but at least they cut that fucking ""i sing annoying songs like this one"" bullshit
* state motto janet varney ep
* did you know we got state birds AND state animals? i learned that like two weeks ago that's crazy
* oh that's all the ads no actual sponsors this time huh lol
* the thing, the thing i really fucking love, that i adore with all my fucking heart, is justin making this borderline broken ability where he gets an extra dice for using an improvised weapon, and the one, the ONE situation where that is not applicable, travis is going to give it to him anyway because ""a narrow hallway is kind of like a bowling alley and you're kind of like a bowling ball rolling into them"" fuck this guy
* 'squidmark turns around and sees you, and wraps his tentacles around you, stopping your momentum in its tracks' like.........physics tho.......
* travis: i will remind you, as a benevolent zookeeper, that you took a \[unintelligible, because rachel is the god of mastering audio tracks\] with you
* fucking great chlora is like a jhonny vasquez ""hurting people is FUN"" ass characters. i bet travis started watching creature commandos and was soooooooooo inspired by their twisted humor
* oh the thing travis reminded them they have is the inexplicable printout that says eel is states witness and going to maxsec
* seal is definitely addressing squidmark rn
* why would he believe seal with a fucking laser printer ass piece of paper
* ""chorla phyllis, despite saying she loves hurting people, does not seem like, riled up?"" i genuinely love when travis accurately describes one of his problems with zero self awareness. you should watch his adventuring academy interview, its full of shit like this
* fuck this 2x speed
* i'm glad that we've given roger a permanent on demand source of techno music so that he too can just abuse the shit out of his abilities. why did you even make these conditional if you aren't going to enforce the conditions
* BARKER INNOVATIONS REPROGRAMMED HIM AND THEN SENT HIM TO JAIL ANYWAY??????????
* 2.5x speed
* 5d8 to convince arty to fight with them because clint has cheetos i honestly don't give a fuck anymore
* 3x speed
* you can tell they recorded this part after the election because now suddenly seal is ""developing class consciousness"" and realizes nothing they do has actually protected the city and that isn't good guys vs bad guys, its the guys in charge vs everyone else
   * while a lot of marxist theorists do believe that the lumpen proletariat will be integral in building the initial vanguard, i somehow don't think that's what griffin is referencing
* yeah ok squidmark or whoever who gives a fuck, says ""huh...so i'd be hurting people....for good?"" and yes, that is actually pretty much a distillation of what the role of the lumpen would be in the vanguard, but griffin immediately backs down because he's a liberal pussy
* this show is such a catch-22 because just talking their way out of this sucks ass but also i would actually kill myself if i had to sit through another classic mcelroy combat round right now
* griffin keeps saying shit about how all of this feels small time in comparison, and how this all feels connected somehow and that's bullshit. that's absolute bullshit. what conspiracy have you stumbled across griffin? what pieces are tied together? what crime are you even pursuing right now you fuck?
* this sucks ass
* thank fucking god that's over

yeah, this is the world's shittiest five room dungeon with an episode per room, meaning we spent the entire runtime of this godforsaken podcast doing fuck all"

Ayda
When I leaped off the overhang, I aimed for the wolf that was right in front of the boy. I landed on him, hearing the satisfying snap of his spine as the wolf howled in pain. The other four wolves immediately turned on me.
I quicky pushed myself off the wolf and back so I was between the pup and the other wolves. They are warriors and while I may not be an Alpha wolf, I was a Luna for several years and I trained with our pack warriors.
I realize as they leap at me, that these are my previous pack members. I know these wolves. They won't recognize me because I smell like a rogue to them, but I recognize them. I have no idea why they are attacking this pup, but I refuse to allow them to hurt or kill him.
It works in my favor that I know their fighting techniques. I may be out of practice, but I still remember my training and when one wolf leaps, I duck, turning my head away from him to counter the attack that I know will come from the other side.
It does, just as I expect and Asena snaps her jaws on the wolf's mouth, snapping his bottom jaw as she quickly thrashes her head back and forth. I release the wolf in front of me as I feel teeth sink into my flank, yanking and ripping me to the side.
I grit my teeth as Asena rips her leg out of the wolf's mouth, leaving a chunk of flesh behind. Another wolf, thinking he has an opening, goes for her throat. Instead, she rolls slashing her claws up under the wolf before quickly regaining her feet. The movement moved us away from the boy, but as long as the others stay focused on us, that's okay. If I can get them far enough away from him, maybe he can run. I'm not even sure what he's doing out here all alone. He's too young to be on his own.
The wolf who first leaped at Asena, leaps again, and this time, two of the other wolves attack at the same time. This is new and I'm not sure if they've learned new skills or if they've modified their attack because I countered it the first time.
The wolf who leaps, gets a hold of the fur and skin on the back of Asena's neck, holding on as he lands and just as she did, he shakes his head furiously, tearing the skin. Another wolf leaps at her, his jaws snapping on her front leg. I hear the snap of her leg and hear her howl of pain in the air and in my mind just as the pain hits me.
The wolf with her leg in his mouth gets thrown to the side as the wolf holding her neck continues to thrash us back and forth. Asena, taking quick advantage of the opportunity, sinks her teeth into the wolf's neck, his blood filling our mouth before she is yanked off of him. One down.
Another wolf leaps at her throat, but she rips her neck out of the wolf's mouth, dropping to the ground, letting the leaping wolf smash into the wolf that was holding her neck.
The wolf with the broken jaw attempts to pin Asena to the ground but instead, she swipes her back claws down the underside of his body, his insides spilling out on the ground. Two down.
The wolf with the broken back is still alive, but paralyzed and unable to shift. He'll die one way or the other. Three down. We turn, focusing on the two who are left.
Asena is badly injured, one leg broken and she's bleeding from the wound on her flank and the terrible tearing on the back of her neck. She stands her ground, holding the injured leg off the ground. She's hurting but the adrenaline flowing through our body is keeping her on her feet.
The two wolves spread out, planning to attack us on two sides. Both of her injuries are on her left side, so she hops, trying to keep her strong side facing the wolves, but eventually, she has no choice but to leave her weak side open to one of the wolves and that's when they attack again.
The one wolf dives for her front leg, probably planning to rip it off. She leaps up, but not before the other wolf, the one who had her by the neck, grabs her right back leg and begins yanking on her leg at a bad angle.
I hear the pop a moment before Asena howls in pain. Her back leg now dislocated and unable to be used. She turns, snapping at the face of the wolf, but he lets go and backs away.
We feel the air shift as the other wolf leaps at us from behind, but she turns her head quickly, snapping her jaws and just missing his throat as she grabs hold of the side of the wolf's neck. We've both just come crashing down to the ground when the boy screams.
""LOOK OUT!""
We release the wolf and turn, barely getting our paws up to push the other wolf off of us, but the pressure on the broken leg and the dislocated leg causes Asena to howl out in pain again.
She rolls on her side, scrambling to get back up onto her feet. The adrenaline isn't enough to keep the pain from radiating through our body. Our body is aching and every time she tries to stand, pain shoots from one part of her body or another.
'Come on, Asena. You can do it. We're all that pup has standing between him and certain death.'
I feel my wolf pull on her inner reserves. I know she's strong, I also know that my wolf will kill herself to try and save me or those she cares about. This time, though, if she goes, I'm going with her.
The two wolves get to their feet, recognizing that they've won. I'm a dead woman, but I can still try to take down at least one more of them. Then there's only one for the boy to fight and that gives him a chance.
I need to take out the stronger one, the one I've barely touched in this fight. The other one is injured and will give the pup a chance to live, or wait for his parents to return. The other one, I'm pretty sure it's Masuzyo's Beta, Marcel, is barely scratched. He's the one that had me by the back of my neck. He's also probably the one who ripped the chunk out of my flank. He needs to die.
'Focus on him, Asena. We take him down before we go down.'
'Okay, Ayda,' she says, and I feel her resolve blending with mine. We know we will die, but we have to do what we can to save this pup. We couldn't save our own, but we can save this one.
The moment they leap, we do too, aiming for Marcel. I hear a yelp, but I can't lose focus. I have to bring this Beta down. His teeth sink into our shoulder, and the two of us hit the ground, rolling end over end. When we stop, Asena is on top, and she snaps her teeth into the side of the wolf's neck. She yanks as hard as she can, ripping flesh away from bone. Marcel howls in pain, releasing her shoulder and she quickly spits out the flesh as her pushes off of him. She scrambles to her feet as he does the same and I can see that our landing has injured him, he's favoring his back leg. Good.
We both snarl at each other and I vaguely realize that the other wolf is gone. I hope he didn't go after the pup. I can't look though, I need to focus on Marcel.
I trained with him many times when I was his Luna, in both wolf and human form. He's formidable, but he's very predictable if you know his moves. Since he's injured, Asena and I guess at his next move. He's going to fake a leap and then come in low, trying to get to our throat.
The moment he looks like he's about to leap, she does instead. As predicted, he drops low, intending to go for Asena's throat. Instead, Asena lands on top of him, her teeth snapping into his neck and crushing his spine. He yelps before she thrashes her head back and forth, making sure the spinal column is severed completely before releasing him.
She turns, stumbling away from him, looking around to check on the boy. He steps out of the thicket, watching us closely. He has blood on his hands and arms and I look to see the other wolf lying dead on the ground, a sharp rock imbedded in his throat.
Asena drops to the ground, pulling the shift that has me screaming in pain. The boy rushes over to me, pulling me into his lap.
""Hang on, my father's coming. Just hang on,"" he says.
""You should run,"" I tell him, as I feel his tears dripping onto my face. ""Run, little Alpha. Get away from here,"" I tell him, realizing now that he's close to me that he's an Alpha pup. No wonder they were after him.
He shakes his head. ""No, I won't leave you. You saved me. I won't leave you.""
I want to tell him to go, to hurry before more wolves come, but I've lost too much blood. We did what we set out to do.
'We saved him, Asena.'
'Yes. It's a good way to die,' she says, as the world goes black around me.

Dimitri
When I arrived, I shifted quickly. There's a wolf whimpering nearby, but he goes quiet as we approach. I point to one of my warriors to finish him off, seeing the blood, guts, and dead bodies littering the area in front of the thicket where my son was hiding. I can smell that these are Masuzyo's men. They found Cathal while I was fighting Masuzyo.
I slowly step forward, seeing my son holding the body of a woman in his arms. He's sobbing over her, rocking her in his arms as if she's his dead mother. I've never seen my son like this before and the image is like a punch to the gut.
Almost as startling as that, is the scent that is coming from this woman, lemongrass and lilies. She smells earthy and floral. I haven't smelled a scent this intoxicating since...
I shake my head. This woman looks like she's on her deathbed, if she's not already dead.
""Cathal, what happened,"" I say, dropping beside him and wrapping an arm around him protectively as I check the woman for a pulse. She's alive, but barely. Her scent has Zev thrashing around in my head, making it hard for me to think.
""She saved me, dad. She fell out of the sky as if dropped by the Moon Goddess herself. She fought them all. They had surrounded me, and she fought them off. I killed that one,"" he says, pointing to a man with a rock lodged in his throat. ""But they were going to kill her. I couldn't let them kill her, dad.""
""No, of course not. You did very well son. Are you injured?""
""No. I'm okay, because of her. She protected me dad. We have to save her,"" he says, fear and worry coloring his tone.
""Hey, hey, breathe. We're going to take care of her,"" I say. I'm not sure I could leave her body even if she was dead. Zev would never allow it.
'We have to get to Masuzyo, Zev.'
'Take care of her first, Dimitri. Her and our pup, then we kill Masuzyo.'
I stand, seeing the dead body of Masuzyo's Beta along with four other warriors. The one that my warrior killed finally shifting back to his human body now that he's dead.
""You two, stay here and hide these bodies. I don't want Masuzyo finding this place until we have a chance to go over it and find where this woman came from. Nico, I need you to carry Cathal back to the pack. I'll get the woman,"" I say to my Gamma before very carefully picking her up her broken body.
I can see Nico's surprise that I'm choosing to carry a rogue woman rather than my own son, but I know my wolf and while I may not understand why this woman smells so good, I know that Zev will kill any man who touches her.
Nico shifts and I help Cathal get on his back before he takes off running. I have to stay on two legs, running with this woman in my arms which slows me significantly.
""Stay with me,"" I murmur to her while I run. ""You need to stay with me.""
I look over the gorgeous woman in my arms as I run. Even covered in blood and gore, she's beautiful to me. I notice that she's much too light given her height. I can see her ribs and her hip bones jutting out from her body. Her hip has a huge gash in it and I can feel the blood dripping down my body where her hip is pressed against me. The other leg is dislocated, and her arm is severely broken. It looks like they tried to rip her arm off, and she'll most likely have shoulder tears, if not a second dislocation. She has several other scratches and injuries that I notice aren't healing.
Her long brown hair is matted with blood and the guts of the wolves she attacked while saving my son, but it looks like it would be silken when clean. She has high cheekbones and she's young, several years younger than me and I'm twenty-seven.
""I'm going to take care of you, but you need to stay with me, you need to stay alive,"" I say.
'Zev, can you feel her wolf?' I ask him.
'She's as weak as the woman is,' he says, but I feel him trying to make a connection, to get the wolf to acknowledge his presence in some way.
'Alpha, we need you!' Sergei says in the mind link. He wouldn't be calling me if he didn't need me.
'I'm almost to our pack lands. I need to take care of something, get Nico, and then I'll be on my way. Where are you?'
""We're outside Masuzyo's pack. He's got us blocked out. I'm pretty sure his Beta is still out here somewhere,' he says.
'His Beta's dead. He attacked Cathal,' I tell him.
'Alpha, is he...' his voice, full of fear.
'No. Someone saved him, a rogue. But I need to make sure both of them are being looked after,' I tell him.
'We'll be here, waiting for you.'
I pass the borders, mind linking the pack hospital that I have an emergency coming in fast.
'Nico, how is Cathal?' I ask as I run through the pack, glancing at my remaining warriors who are cleaning up the mess around the pack where our pack members or Masuzyo's pack members are lying dead on the ground.
'The doctor is looking him over now, but he says that he looks fine, other than some superficial scratches. I'm pretty sure they're going to release him.'
'Good, I'm almost there,' I say.
When I rush through the hospital door, the team is waiting for me. I know they are busy with my pack members, but this woman needs help and she saved my son.
When I lay her down, the doctor comes rushing out, looking at her.
""This is a rogue,"" he says to me, surprised.
""And you will treat her,"" I order, holding Zev back as the doctor begins looking over her injuries.
""Her wolf is weak, we'll need to take her into surgery, Alpha. It will be a couple of hours before I'll know if she'll survive.""
""Make sure she stays alive,"" Zev growls at him. The doctor jumps but nods. I pull Zev back and turn, linking Nico to join me.
""I have to go. Masuzyo made it back to his pack. We may have more injured. Make sure you have enough staff here to assist throughout the night,"" I tell him. I look at the woman once more before shifting and racing from the pack hospital.
Zev lifts his head to the sky, howling to Cathal that we'll return, howling to the pack that they are safe and howling for the woman who may or may not survive until morning."
"Magic, romance, and horse girls – a Robin McKinley retrospective",Fantasy,1i8gy7j,2025-01-23 18:11:31,71,0.89,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i8gy7j/magic_romance_and_horse_girls_a_robin_mckinley/,EternalLifeSentence,,"Robin McKinley and I go way back, all the way to when my bookish 10-year-old self was given a copy of *Beauty* for Christmas by my equally bookish aunt. Over the years I’ve read a few of her other books, all of which I enjoyed, but recently I decided that I was going to get through them all – this post is a compilation of my experiences (plus a few cheats)

Robin McKinley is an American author who’s lived in England for the last several decades and although she received several highly-distinguished awards (including a Newberry medal!), she still remains less well-known than many other fantasy authors – I see her mention on this sub, but not super regularly. Likely a large part of this is because most of her work falls under the Young Adult genre, which tends to get less discussion in broader fantasy circles. Another contributing factor is almost certainly that she stopped publishing after the death of her husband in 2015, making it more than a decade since her most recent work came out.

Still, there’s more than 30 years worth of books to dig into, so let’s get started!

*Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast* (1978) – This was the book that got me started with McKinley, and it remains her most popular for a reason. As the subtitle suggests, this is a retelling of the classic fairytale. The story is expanded on and detailed, but the take is straightforward. No strange twists or alternate universes here and despite what might seem to be a ripoff of the Disney movie, this version actually predates it by more than a decade! This book introduces a lot of what will become McKinley staples in the future – detailed descriptions of food and environments and outfits, sweet and plucky female heroines with down-to-earth narration, prominent animal characters, and a slow start with a somewhat rushed ending. This one’s genuinely a lot of fun, basically hot cocoa in book form. 8/10

Bingo squares: Dreams, Romantasy

*The Door in the Hedge* (1981) – A collection of three short stories and a novella. Two of them are original, two are retellings (of “The Princess and the Frog” and “The Twelve Dancing Princesses”), and all are very much in the same style as *Beauty*, just shorter. There’s lush description, likable characters, and pacing issues. Very cozy, but ultimately nothing to write home about. 6/10

*The Blue Sword* (1982) – McKinley’s second best-known work, this is a classic trope-y fantasy adventure story featuring a teenage orphan who moves to a new home and finds herself the centerpiece of a desert people’s prophecy after she catches the attention of their king. Although people have (rightly) pointed out that there’s some white savior-y stuff that hasn’t aged super well and the protagonist adjusts to her new life a bit too fast to be believable, I appreciate the sincerity with which the story is told. A lot of newer books feel the need to snark at or subvert the tropes they use and while that can sometimes be fun, *The Blue Sword* plays it all straight and sometimes that’s just what you need. 7/10

Bingo squares: First in a Series (hey, a duology counts, right), Dreams

*The Hero and the Crown* (1984) – The most critically acclaimed McKinley book, this prequel to *The Blue Sword* is what netted her the Newberry. It follows the story of Aerin, the “Lady-Hero” whose story is referenced frequently in the earlier book and has fun playing with the way that legends are built and the parallels and differences between the two protagonists. The first half is super solid, but I felt that the last half of the book wound up feeling very vague and lost a clear cause-and-effect chain to events, making the villain’s defeat feel unsatisfying. Further, while the details are impossible to explain without spoilers, I found the resolution to the romantic subplot infuriating, although looking online, this seems to be a minority opinion. 6/10

Bingo squares: Character with a disability (Aerin’s horse. Probably qualifies for Hard Mode if you count Aerin’s magical ailment)

*Imaginary Lands* (1986) – One of the cheats on this list. McKinley was the editor here, but only one of the stories is hers and it’s actually one of the weaker ones. The theme, here, is that in every story, “the land” plays a major role, whether it’s a magical location or a meditative journey through a landscape. Apart from that, there’s a lot of variety here (everything from lighthearted children’s tales to loss-heavy alternate histories and Arthurian legend). McKinley’s piece, “The Stone Fey”, deals with a shepherd girl who meets a strange spirit in the mountains. 8/10

Bingo Squares: Five short stories

*The Outlaws of Sherwood* (1988) – Cheat #2, this one isn’t technically speculative fiction, but historical fiction, and attempts a down-to-earth take on the Robin Hood story and examines in a very subdued way how heroes are forged from the collective efforts of larger groups and of the value of symbols to a movement, as well as the way that many important movements are held up by the practical skills of ordinary, unsung people (often women). The pacing issues are gone here and there’s a bit of wry humor, some very light romance, and a lot of fun, although Robin himself does get a bit lost in the ensemble cast towards the end. 8/10

*Deerskin* (1993) – By far the darkest entry in McKinley’s bibliography, this is a loose retelling of “All Furs” and follows the recovery of a young princess from a horrific act of incestuous abuse. The dreamy, restrained style adds to the horror in a way that I was not expecting and the climax, while a bit abrupt, is satisfying and wraps up just enough that it feels finished without making emotional healing seem too “clean” and simple. 9/10

Bingo Squares: Entitled Animals, Character with a Disability (amnesia and PTSD, Hard Mode if these count for you), Published in the 1990s, Survival (borderline, but a huge story arc is about surviving alone in the woods)

*A Knot in the Grain and Other Stories* (1994) – Another return to familiar territory, this collection has five tales that, for the most part, share a cozy, comforting vibe and a fairytale-esque feeling (although they are all, as far as I know, original). Most have a light sprinkling of cute romance, adding to the fun and the pacing was better than many of her other works. There was, however, one story that had a really uncomfortable age gap with pseudo-incest and possible grooming coming in, which I found oddly placed next to the rest of the stories. 7/10

Bingo Squares: Published in the 1990s, Five Short Stories

*Rose Daughter* (1997) – McKinley’s second take on Beauty and the Beast, this one with far more embellishment. The descriptions in this one get to be a bit much and while there’s a lot of interesting stuff here (for example, the twining of the Beast and Beauty’s backstories together in a somewhat unexpected way), the book doesn’t seem interested in focusing on them, nor on the relationship between our two leads, spending most of its time on village drama. Another tweak to the original story shows up at the end that I think will be love-it-or-hate-it for most readers, but while I thought it was interesting, ultimately I just wished I’d reread *Beauty* 6/10

Bingo Squares: Dreams, Romantasy, Published in the 1990s, Set in a Small Town

*Spindle’s End* (2000) – A Sleeping Beauty retelling this time, with a tone very similar to *Rose Daughter*’s. The narration is lighthearted and humorous, the world saturated with magic, and there’s a lot of focus on female friendships and mother/daughter bonds. The first half of the story, as the fairies hide the infant princess, is quite well-done, but the book falls apart in the second half, with a confusing finale that heavily relies on shaky worldbuilding and underdeveloped love interests. 6/10

Bingo Squares: Set in a Small Town

*Sunshine* (2003) – McKinley’s first novel-length foray into urban fantasy, this follows a young baker who is kidnapped as a meal for a vampire, only to discover that he’s being held prisoner just as much as she is. Together they plot an escape into a world of magic that she can no longer ignore. The worldbuilding on this one was entertaining and I liked a lot of the characters, but the plot meandered, a lot of those characters were underutilized, and overall the whole thing really needed editing down. 7/10

*Water: Tales of Elemental Spirits* (2004) – Six short stories, of which half were written by McKinley and half by her husband, Peter Dickinson, all themed around the classical element of water. There’s mermaids, there’s sea serpents, there’s underwater cities, and I found it delightful. First two stories are a bit weaker than the rest, but overall very well worth it. 8/10

Bingo Squares: Under the Surface, Five Short Stories

*Dragonhaven* (2007) – As far as I know, the only full-length McKinley book with a male protagonist. *Dragonhaven* follows a teenager living at a nature preserve for the earth’s few remaining dragons, where he suddenly becomes responsible for raising an orphaned hatchling. The themes of family and loss brought a lot to the magical-teen-pregnancy story and the attention to dragon biology and ecology was great, but the excessively quirky first-person narration overstayed its welcome a bit and the side characters were pretty bland. 6/10

Bingo Squares: Entitled Animals (Hard Mode)

*Chalice* (2008) – A fascinating world revolving around land-based guardian magic, leylines, and high ritual, this one left me wanting more in a good way. This one is all about the vibes and I enjoyed getting tantalizing tidbits of information about the setting and the people in it as our protagonist comes into her own ceremonial role in the land. It does throw a bit too much terminology at the reader a bit too fast in the beginning, though, and suffers from a bit (albeit less) of *Sunshine’s* repetitive interior monologue. 8/10

Bingo Squares: Romantasy

*Fire: Tales of Elemental Spirits* (2009) – A followup to *Water* and another collaboration with Dickinson, these five stories feature the likes of dragons and phoenixes. This one was kind of a disappointment. There’s some decent stuff in here, but it never sucked me in the way the previous installment did and the ones I disliked were actively bad instead of being merely forgettable. 6/10

Bingo Squares: Five short stories

*Pegasus* (2010) – Probably the only book by Robin McKinley that I actively dislike. A pegasus prince and a human princess discover that they can understand each other when no other humans or pegasi can communicate without magical aid, setting off ripples in both countries. This one was, I believe, originally a short story and it shows badly. Very little happens in the plot, the setting’s history is delivered in long infodumps, and the stakes are almost completely told, not shown. Don’t recommend this one, especially since it was planned to be the first of a trilogy but never got its followup. 4/10

Bingo Squares: Entitled Animals (Hard Mode),

*Earth and Air: Tales of Elemental Creatures* (2012) – The last of the cheats on this list, this final installment in the Tales of Elemental Spirits series is actually all Dickinson (McKinley was too busy with other projects), but since it was the conclusion to a series, I figured I’d throw it in anyway. Dickinson’s work was always less enjoyable to me than McKinley’s and here it amounts to a resounding “meh”. The stories are a mixed bag, but on nearly all of them, I struggled to get emotionally invested. The narration seems too detached from its subjects and so much of the story is summarized or skimmed over that it starts to feel like reading a summary of a novel someone else read. 5/10

Bingo Squares: Five short stories

*Shadows* (2013) – In a world where citizens have voluntarily cut themselves off from magic to prevent dimensional instabilities, Maggie gets a new stepfather who seems to have multiple shadows that only she can see. There was a lot of classic McKinley in this one, with the emphasis on love for animals and on family. The localized, small-scale plot is a good fit for her style and although I have issues with how neatly and quickly everything seemed to wrap up at the end and with the faint note of “how do you do, fellow kids” that I could feel through, this one was pretty solid, if unremarkable. 7/10

So, how would I summarize all of this? Let’s start with a tier list:

The Good, books I would recommend to everyone and either own or plan to buy:

*Beauty, The Blue Sword, Imaginary Lands, The Outlaws of Sherwood, Deerskin, Chalice, Water*

The Bad, books I would discourage you from reading:

*Spindle’s End, Pegasus, Earth and Air*

The Meh, books that I would recommend if you’re a fan of McKinley’s writing style or if you like the premise

*The Door in the Hedge, A Knot in the Grain, Rose Daughter, Sunshine, Dragonhaven, Fire, Shadows*

As for the author overall? She’s a pretty good writer with very defined strengths and weakness. All of this is obviously pretty subjective and applies to some books more than others, but I like to think it’s a pretty good summary

You might enjoy Robin McKinley’s work if you’re looking for:

\-Strong female characters, as much of a truism as that phrase is

\-An emphasis on relationships between the protagonist and their family and pets

\-Cozy vibes (even *Deerskin* still has a bit of a comforting tone to it and the emphasis in her work is on good people finding happiness)

\-Lots of description

\-A bit of humor and romanticism (although not all of her work is directly romance-focused)

\-Fairytale retellings

\-A “clean” story. Very little/no swearing, no graphic sex scenes or gore.

You might not like her work if you want books with:

\-Strong pacing. It’s better in some books than others, but keeping a tight rein on the forward motion of the plot is not something she’s great at

\-Well-developed male characters. Even the love interests are often a bit flat.

\-Lots of action. She doesn’t do a lot of battle scenes and the confrontations are typically emotional or magical rather than big shootouts or sword fights

\-Hard magic systems or super-defined worldbuilding. You’re not going to get a detailed explanation of how magic works or what dragons can or cannot do

\-Lots of “spice” in your romance. Even in the more romance-focused works, the most you’ll get is a bit of naked cuddling or a description of a butt.

I had a lot of fun doing a sort of author deep dive here and hopefully this will help someone else out! I'm already thinking about doing another, similar project for other authors from my childhood.

EDIT WITH SOME THINGS I FORGOT BECAUSE IT WAS LATE WHEN I POSTED THIS:

\-as u/cjohn102 pointed out, the romances in McKinley's books often (but not always) feature large age gaps (and occasionally power imbalances) between the male and female leads. If it's the kind of thing that's going to bother you, it would be worth checking which books do or do not feature these kinds of relationships. Or just ask me in the comments

\-the books also don't feature a ton of racial or LGBT rep. There's definitely some non-white characters (the setting of *The Blue Sword* and *The Hero and the Crown* is a fantasy Middle Eastern setting, for example), and the later books will occasionally mention off-hand that a side character is gay, but if having a cast that's diverse in those aspects is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere

\-I see semi-frequent requests for books with no sexual assault on this sub, and McKinley is not a bad author if this is something you're sensitive to. *Deerskin* is the obvious exception here, but none of the rest of her work does more than allude to SA in a line or two. For example, early in *Shadows*, the protagonist mentions that her new stepdad makes her uncomfortable and her best friend asks if she means like last year, when one of their teachers was caught grooming a student. The protagonist clarifies that she doesn't mean that kind of uncomfortable and the subject never comes up again. A good chunk of her work doesn't even go that far. Again, check online or ask in the comments, and note that this discussion only refers to McKinley's stuff, not anyone else in her collaborations, which was too big and dirverse a group of authors for me to easily summarize."

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/flight-risk-2025/) 38 (25 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Todd Gilchrist, Variety - Director Mel Gibson delivers is a crude, unimaginative, suspenseless adventure whose tension mostly derives from deciding which of its three main characters will prove the most unlikable by the time it ends.

Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter - You’ll be shaking your head at the sheer ludicrousness of it all. But it’s a pretty good bet that you haven’t once felt the desire to look at your phone.

William Bibbiani, TheWrap - Anyway, it’s also weird to find a mediocre straight-to-DVD action movie inside of a major movie theater, instead of in the bargain bin at a Big Lots in 2010.

Mark Kennedy, Associated Press - No one emerges unscathed from this funny-when-it-shouldn’t-be mess. The movie’s slogan is the weird “Y’all Need a Pilot?” but it should be “Y’all Need a Filmmaker?” **0/4**

Alissa Wilkinson, New York Times - Where “Flight Risk” fails as a film is not really Gibson’s fault. He knows how to shoot action sequences. The screenplay is instead all over the place, in a way that feels tired and halfhearted.

Zachary Barnes, Wall Street Journal - To be fair, Jared Rosenberg’s witless screenplay has several stretches that no director could make exciting, or even minimally endurable.

Bob Strauss, San Francisco Chronicle - The equivalent of a suspenseful Spirit Airlines commercial... **2/4**

Peter Howell, Toronto Star - Mel Gibson’s risible new movie, “Flight Risk,” takes off with a splash of toilet humour before nosediving into the realm of the ridiculous. **1/4**

Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail - A C-grade thriller that is further dumbed down to dunce-cap calibre, Flight Risk might have worked as an enjoyably grimy piece of genre trash had Gibson not made every single wrong directorial decision along the way.

Peter Bradshaw, Guardian - The film is, of course, very silly, but diverting and ingenious, and contains game performances from Wahlberg, Dockery and Grace. **3/5**

Jonathan Romney, Financial Times - There are a few mildly ingenious twists and contrivances, but overall, it’s all cynically functional, hair’s-breadth mid-air escapes and all. **2/5**

Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) - To describe the plot as stupid wouldn’t be inaccurate, exactly. But it’s methodically, even artisanally stupid, built in accordance with the classic thriller rules. Every twist plays fair, no matter how outlandish. **4/5**

Alison Willmore, New York Magazine/Vulture - Flight Risk is a dumb movie, which is not its primary sin. The problem is that it’s not the right kind of dumb -- the kind where everyone involved is committed to the innate silliness of what they’re doing.

Christian Zilko, indieWire - When evaluated as a work of pure craftsmanship, Flight Risk is some of the finest stupidity Hollywood has gifted us in a long time. **B+**

Andy Crump, AV Club - Over-writing doesn’t delay Flight Risk’s pace or tension; Wahlberg does. The actor ended up apologizing for his boneheaded 9/11 remarks not long after making them. Maybe one day he’ll apologize for Flight Risk, too. **C**

Mark Hanson, Slant Magazine - Given that Mel Gibson makes little attempt to instill any sense of physicality to this dispiritingly paint-by-numbers affair, it becomes easy to understand the marketing of the film’s 4DX theatrical option as an act of overcompensation. **1/4**

Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence - Flight Risk has its funny moments, though none of them are funnier than when the end credits start and you’re reminded, once again, that this movie was directed by Mel Gibson. **C**

A.A. Dowd, Digital Trends - Gibson botches the assignment at every turn. You needn’t harbor any contempt for the disgraced filmmaker to peg Flight Risk as cheap and choppy heckle fodder. **1.5/5**

Clint Worthington, [RogerEbert.com](http://RogerEbert.com) \- The lean 90-minute runtime is a very tempting sell for a lean chamber piece like this. But what happens in that 90 minutes has to actually entertain, which is where “Flight Risk” runs into some real turbulence. **1.5/4**

Nell Minow, Movie Mom - ""Flight Risk"" has all of the ingredients for a tight little thriller except one. Sloppy direction from Mel Gibson interferes with the best the film has to offer. **C**

**SYNOPSIS:**

In this high-stakes suspense thriller, Academy Award nominee Mark Wahlberg (Actor in a Supporting Role, 2006 – The Departed) plays a pilot transporting an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) accompanying a fugitive (Topher Grace) to trial. As they cross the Alaskan wilderness, tensions soar and trust is tested, as not everyone on board is who they seem.

So sick of hearing this racist bs in my games.,marvelrivals,1i8gev6,2025-01-23 17:47:23,0,0.43,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i8gev6/so_sick_of_hearing_this_racist_bs_in_my_games/,Electrical-Today8170,Discussion,"Ok, I will preface this with:
Yes I'm white
Yes I'm English 
Yes I live in Australia 

THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO TELL ME TO ""F OFF BACK HOME"" OR ""GO PLAY ON YOUR OWN SERVER'S""

If I was almost any other ethnicity, this would be flat out racist, but, because I'm English, it's ok to yell this at me mid game?

I mainly play ranked, solo. I mainly 3 instapick DPS, followed by 1 healer and 1 tank, then I usually play heals. If I can, I will play Namor, especially if Luna is an instant pick.

I try to communicate effectively within the team, I will talk about swaps, who I can play effectively, and how with a few small changes, the team will be top tier, usually after we are getting beat 0 kills as a team to 5 deaths each. 
It's usually something like ""we could probably do with ""x"" on the team, I can play ""blah"" if you can swap, as I can't play others too effectively, unless someone else can swap fill in the gap"".

75-80% of my games are fine, even if we lose, I don't expect to win EVERY game, we can even have a laugh at how bad we all did and hope we don't have to do it again next game (I'm sure we've all been there, lose a match to get the same players next game) 

But, for the other 20-25% of games, I'm met with the bs attitude about my accent, how I'm not welcome in Australia etc.. even the classic ""cup of tea"" in a London accent (sort of), even though I'm from so far up North I dig cole out my ass. 

I'd honestly hate to play this game on Comms if you have a distinctive accent that leaves you open to abuse, like an Indian accent, I could only imagine how bad it must get with all these losers carrying on, thinking it's funny. 

I get it's school holidays, but most of the time they sound a lot older then kids, basically, full blow racists playing this game, around your kids, encouraging this behaviour. 

What a disgrace you people are.

I've started to call them out, and if they continue, I throw my games now. I've over it. 

I'm a diamond 1 player currently back in Plat as I refuse to win with a racist team, or a team that doesn't call them out and instead laugh. 


I might be overreacting, but if this is what it's like for a Englishman playing in Australia, I'd dred to think what gets said to other nationalites while playing "

Forever side-questing and overwhelm,AuDHDWomen,1i8epta,2025-01-23 16:34:13,22,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8epta,Background_Spray8675,my ADHD side,"I am forever on a 'sidequest'. I'm on holidays (teacher) so my normal although hectic routine is out, I don't get my quiet people free drive to work, actually very very little people free time at the moment with kids home- trying to set the scene. Anyway, while I have my long term passions I am also on an exhausting run of side quests. In 5 weeks I've learnt to make kokodama,   preserve insects and create displays, back into macrame, sewing, learning to surf, hair wraps (beaded, weaved etc), building rustic bird feeders. Of course I have to have EVERYTHING I need to to do these so hours sourcing products online, in vintage stores etc, reading, learning, practice. I love it but it is EXHAUSTING. Plus tending to my normal focuses of aquariums, plants, insect keeping.
I can't stop! My brain is switching between all of them, i get overwhelmed with where to store everything (I'm super organized- so that takes time to make it perfect and label and sort everything) 
I feel like this is so classic of the Audhd combo. 
How the heck do I rest? A big thing for me is being efficient and productive so stopping and not 'achieving' much causes a lot of discomfort. 
Do others deal with this? How do you stop. I wish I had no responsibilities so I could just go, but kids, running a house, getting ready for the next school year. Usually to make time I bypass things like my own self care i.e showering, eating, toilet breaks, gym.

I guess I just want to relate to someone. Is this typical? And I just handle it poorly?

Added some pics of my side-questing 😂"
"When giving gifts, it's the thought that counts",Intactivism,1i8emyg,2025-01-23 16:31:00,35,0.96,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Intactivism/comments/1i8emyg/when_giving_gifts_its_the_thought_that_counts/,recordman410,,"Hello! Many members of this sub have messaged me eager to know what I did with the broken pieces of the smashed Gomco clamp I posted about on 1/14. Thank you to all who did - your kind words mean more to me than you could ever know! 

After I smashed the clamp, I had a moment of clarity once the ensuing torrent of emotions ran their course. I realized that my pediatrician stole my foreskin but she didn't steal my balls. Accordingly, I decided to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to return the favor and mail her a ""not-care"" package containing the following items (photo at ibb.co/D8xBPjG):

1. All the broken clamp pieces wrapped in a baggie

2. A mint condition copy of the classic Foreskin Man comic #1, aka the ""Dr. Mutilator"" issue

3. A printed copy of the negligent nurse meme captioned ""How can I ever apologize for circumcising all those boys?""  

4. A printed illustration of a human spine, with my handwritten message underneath of ""What good was it for you to have studied human spines in medical school when you've spent your entire career never having one yourself?"" followed by my signature. (Not photographed to protect my private information.) This is also a nod to my sibling who regretfully endured severe spinal trauma as a child at the hands of this same negligent pediatrician.

According to USPS, the package was delivered at her door on 1/21 and I have felt like a new man ever since! While I'm obviously still bothered by what she did to me, knowing that I have FINALLY finished the hell she started is the best testament I can think of to both my morality and personal integrity which she horrendously violated more than three decades ago. Sheryl Crow was right - the first cut really IS the deepest! Thanks for reading and let's keep saving boys from this barbaric and archaic practice!

Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real Pain” Asks Us to Acknowledge Our Pain – Review,moviereviews,1i8c9k3,2025-01-23 14:52:25,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviereviews/comments/1i8c9k3/jesse_eisenbergs_a_real_pain_asks_us_to/,ColtonGomez,,"“A Real Pain” is the second of Jesse Eisenberg’s directed features. He also wrote, produced, and costars in it. “A Real Pain” has earned two Oscar nominations. One for Kieran Culkin as a supporting actor, and the other for Jesse Eisenberg as writer of an original screenplay. Both of these are very well deserved and I think they have excellent chances of winning.

Cousins David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji Kaplan (Kieran Culkin) leave the states to go on a Holocaust tour of Poland to honor the memory of their late grandmother. David is a tightly wound bundle of nerves who always tries to make social situations as smooth as possible. Benji is a refreshingly honest person with a high emotional sensitivity. He’s also full of charm and can make friends with anybody. They are part of a small group that includes Jennifer Grey as a divorcee, Will Sharpe as their British tour guide, Kurt Egyiawan as a Rwandan genocide survivor, and playing husband and wife retirees are Daniel Oreskes and Liza Sadovy. Their tour is filled with laughs, connection, sorrow, and remembrance.

Eisenberg chooses to score the film with Polish composer Chopin’s classical piano pieces. This helps to connect the film with Polish history and culture. It also works spectacularly to help shape the performances of Eisenberg and Culkin. Chopin’s quick-stepping piano dances up and down in tone as we stare at interesting architecture. It lays the foundation for the trip as Benji is a character of extreme highs and extreme lows. We can see his mind working as he stares at the tour’s first statue accompanied by the scaling of Chopin. Immediately, we are told Benji is a complicated character. David is also part of the scene but in the background. David, too, is complicated, but doesn’t allow that part of himself to be seen or engaged with. Benji is one to put all of himself on display in his desire for people to simply be honest with each other and acknowledge that life isn’t all beautiful all the time.

Culkin does astounding work to create this character. This is a tough role to get right and in the hands of a lesser actor, he comes off as rude, impatient, immature, and despicable. But Culkin knows what he’s doing. He feels like a real person with real pain who actually seems to restrain himself a bit in how he displays himself. Seeing Benji act out sometimes and hold back other times, shows how tormented he is as a person who’s dealing with the loss of his grandmother, who he calls, “my most favorite person in the world.” Culkin is the acting stand out of the film as he brings a horrifying sorrow to a person who just wants to feel like he matters in other people’s lives. Culkin brings this character to life who is funny, honest, charming, and chaotic.

Eisenberg has a less showy role but his is equally important. His role grounds the film as a modern, anxiety-ridden, working family man who doesn’t feel the need to burden everyone with his pain because it is “so unexceptional.” He does an amazing job with his character but also as writer, director, and producer of the film. This film feels like it has a life of its own. This isn’t a vanity project for Eisenberg but a truly meaningful story about connection and honesty in a world that has seemingly lost meaning of both those terms. He shapes his characters and their performances so that they also feel like real people who you have met or will meet. Nobody tries to steal the show. Everyone in this movie is doing their part to support Eisenberg’s vision.

I watched this film twice and it only improved on the second watch. I noticed more things that Eisenberg and Culkin were doing as actors that helped to make them feel real and reactive. Eisenberg will give little facial twitches that almost form a smile, as if he’s actively resisting feeling any emotion for fear of it being misunderstood or not appropriate, even when he’s being complimented. Culkin watches his costars for their reactions closely. He tries to make it seem as if he doesn’t care that much about what other people think of him but those quick glances tell us he’s depending on their acknowledgment.

Being nice, cordial, and conscious of others is possibly good for the moment but in the long run it just yields further, hidden pain. The reflective pain of what we wish we would have done, what we wish we would have said, and how we wish we were unafraid to experience life and let others experience us in turn. Benji is unafraid to confront his issues with people as he is unafraid to make friends with them just as readily. He brings honesty with him everywhere he goes. But he isn't rude. He keeps others honest as he wishes others kept him honest; like his grandma did.

This is a fairly simple and straightforward story that is neatly wrapped in a ninety-minute package. But in those short ninety minutes, Eisenberg brings us a story that feels right and relevant. He performs a great feat of swinging our emotions around from high laughter to tragic remembrance and all in between that feels so natural and effortless. He engages us in a great conversation of when and how to acknowledge our feelings but lets the question stay with you.

Eisenberg delivers a great story in “A Real Pain.” I’m excited to see his directing skills progress. Some of the choices early on in the film felt slightly unnatural and disconnected with the rest of the film. Namely some odd lines of dialogue, some blocking direction, and some scenes where performances didn’t feel like they should have made the final cut. I’m unsure where the issues stem from. It could be from direction, performance, or editing that makes these few parts feel off. Nevertheless, this is a great story and a great film. Knowing that the budget for this film was only $3 million makes it all the more impressive. There are a multitude of reasons to see this film and seeing as Culkin and Eisenberg were recently nominated for Academy Awards, maybe start there.

Mobapad S1 HD/M6 HD in-depth review/comparison,Switch,1i8b4we,2025-01-23 14:05:09,8,0.83,10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8b4we,a15diecidue,Discussion,"Just received the S1 HD and it surprised me by how comfortable it is to hold. Haven’t seen a lot of reviews/comparisons online for these new set of Joycons so I’ll just run down the pros and cons of the buttons and feel of each. Also, both Joycons feel far superior than Nintendo’s official ones (no surprise there), with all the same features, gyro, Amiibo support, HD rumble, etc. (minus IR Sensor). All these features work perfectly fine and are the same in both so I won’t mention them.

Pros of S1 HD:
- Way more comfortable to hold than the M6 HD. The indents for your fingers on the back make a huge difference and allow your hand to wrap around and grip it a lot better. The most comfortable my switch has ever felt.
- The distance between the trigger and bumper buttons is much better than the M6 HD. It’s shorter and doesn’t feel straining on your pointer finger when switching from bumper to trigger.
- More lightweight than the M6 HD, weight feels the same if not slightly heavier to normal Joycons.
- D Pad’s shape is way better and more concave than the one that comes with the M6 HD.
- The sticks are not as slippery as the M6 HD

Cons of S1 HD:
- The face buttons and D Pad feel cheaper than the M6 HD. I was never a fan of soft buttons, and these have no click. Complete opposite of the clicky buttons on the M6 HD, wish Mobapad found a balance in the middle for these (M6’s feels nice, just annoyingly loud). I can deal with the softness on the D Pad, but the for the face buttons they need to have some click (always felt like the buttons pressed late when playing fast-paced games)
- No face plates, just black and white (which can get pretty boring imo). Surprised me since the smaller size of these seems better for children, so including multiple/swappable colors would help with the appeal to younger people. If anyone from Mobapad is reading this, please make a Neon Red faceplate/version for both
- Placement of the D Pad and Right Stick is uncomfortable. Thats to be expected with a more vertical layout.
- ZL and ZR could be just the slightest bit bigger (longer)

Pros of M6 HD:
- Placement of the D Pad and Right stick is much better, makes me want to play shooters.
- Face buttons are very responsive, actually felt like they made me play better.
- Pressing down on the sticks is easier than the S1’s, and feels more high quality.
- Plus, Minus, Home, and Capture buttons feel more high quality and less cheap than the S1
- Swappable faceplates (just needs that classic neon Nintendo red now)
- M1 and M2 buttons on the back (I don’t find these too necessary tho, but they’re nice to have). They feel great as well, more tactile, not mouse clicky.

Cons of M6 HD:
- Way too fat for no reason. I’m surprised nobody else mentions this, but my hands get fatigued when holding this for awhile. Having it as heavy as it is doesn’t help either. Causes your hands to slip when repositioning sometimes (and I have big-average sized hands). Not very ergonomic on the back, and had to think about the most comfortable way to hold these when first receiving them.
- Face buttons feel too far to the right. This is my biggest complaint with these, since so many games use that A button all the time. It feels very straining to reach the A button (and even B, if the tip of my thumb isn’t on Y). I think this issue goes back to the ergonomics of the back of the controller, since there’s no ridge or anything to grip (besides having a textured surface on the back), so holding the Switch up while simultaneously forcing ur thumb to the right causes a straining feeling that’ll make you feel like you’re fighting with the controller overtime. Ironically, making the bottom of this controller wider might fix this issue (so your hands don’t feel like they’re squeezing together when reaching those buttons). It sounds like a “my hands are too big” problem but the placement of the S1’s face buttons feels amazing and that’s smaller (like your thumb just rests on all four buttons rather than putting in effort to press that A and B). This was the first problem that I noticed right away when receiving these.
- Reaching the bumpers is very uncomfortable. My fingers sit very nicely on ZL and ZR naturally, but switching to those bumpers ingame is very straining and actually requires effort (putting my pointer fingers in an awkward position). I think this goes back to both the ergonomics on the back of the controller, but also how thick the bumpers are. How thin they made them on the S1 and the distance your finger has to go between the bumper and trigger on those is perfect.
- The D Pad it comes with feels like a toy, not concave. Luckily the satellite dish looking D Pad is much better, but still feels unnecessary clicky for a D Pad.
- Almost every single button on these sounds like a mouse click, very loud and high pitched. Doesn’t bother me too much tho, just bothers those around me.

In conclusion, you can’t go wrong with either. I’m leaning more towards the S1 because of how comfortable the back is, lighter, and that bumper/trigger placement. However, the M6 just has more responsive buttons that makes the S1 feel cheap (and also has better D Pad and Right stick placement). These are both by far the best Joycons on the market, and I think Mobapad could really create the perfect joycon/controller if they combined elements from the two. Basically, a slightly wider S1 so the D Pad and Right Stick are better positioned. An S1 that’s still lightweight with a more clicky D Pad and face buttons (not sounding like a mouse click), as well as having faceplates. Making it feel like the M6 HD when pressing down on the joysticks, home button, capture button, and plus and minus buttons would also be a bonus.

Also an fyi: the S1 doesn’t fit in the M6 HD carrying case. There’s no case for the S1 currently."

I take her to see new releases when I can make the time. She also loves Turner Classic. 

She’s been living alone since grandfather passed and so she’s mostly been dependent on my family and the cable schedule to watch movies. She can’t really wrap her head around all the menus on streaming apps and smart tvs, especially now that tv UI’s are sacrificing function for ad space.

Since I’m something of a physical media junkie myself, I thought I could get her a Disc Player that would be easy enough for her to use so she could borrow movies from the library. That way she’d have more agency in what she gets to watch on her own. 

Possibly a stupid question, but I wanted to ask enthusiasts what model would be best for someone like my grandma. My price range is pretty good as long as I’m not bankrupting myself. Usability for someone like her is what’s most important, she doesn’t need anything crazy or top of the line, just usability. Too many buttons and extra features will stress her out. Is there preferred model for what I’m looking for or will just about anything do fine? 

Any suggestions would be appreciated, thank you."

The Scene cuts to Pete at the Tavern

Topher: Hey Preston how was work today?

The Scene cuts to the interview

Mark Publishman: Hey Preston  ya son of a bitch thanks  for coming so i've had the chance to skim through your comic submission the other and i got to say its great what was your inspiration in making the Adventures of Radio active robot

Preston: See back when i was a kid use to have a toy robot my mom got me for Christmas where i used to take it out everywhere i went until i lost think my dad sold it for drugs

Mark Publishman: The concept is totally unique

Preston: Absolutely. I wanted it to feel nostalgic but still fresh. Think 80s sci-fi comics meets modern absurdity. It’s a blend of homage and my own spin

Mark Publishman: I see so who's your audience what type of people you see picking this up

Preston: People who like shows like Invincible . The Boys and Daredevil

Mark Publishman: Fucking interesting bro so how many issues you done so far?

Preston: Sixteen but im planning to go up to forty five

Mark Publishman: Your welcome your very welcome \*Grins\*

The Scene cuts to Preston at home

He is seen scrolling through the internet on his desk

Preston: Holy shit

Until he sees the website of the comic book publisher Borden comics  his Comic

Preston: Oh my God!

He then calls The Borden Chief editor Mark Publishman

Mark Publishman: What up?  Publisher of Borden comics how may we help you?

Preston: Yeah uh huh this is  Preston Reinhold Im the creator of The Radioactive Robot  we gotta talk about something important

Mark Publishman: Ah Presto great to hear from you bud Radioactive Robot is a hit wonder right now so what can i do for ya?

Preston: Yeah, well, I was looking through the contract you know, the one I   signed and I noticed this little detail I must’ve missed. Apparently, *you guys own my comic now?* Like, all of it? The characters, the story, the whole thing?"" Like what the fuck!

Mark Publishman: Thats Precise my good friend As Per the Agreement you signed Borden comics holds the intellectual property rights to The radioactive Robot Its just standard Practice in the industry Preston

Preston: Standard practice?! So you’re telling me that I poured *two years* into creating this comic, and now it’s not even mine anymore? You could turn it into a movie, a theme park, a breakfast cereal, and I wouldn’t get anything!?

Mark Publishman: Calm down your  still receive royalties based on the terms outlined in your contract. The upfront payment you received was for transferring those rights to us. Think of it as a partnership

Preston: Fuck you Mark!

He hangs up from the phone and starts getting very angry

Preston: Raaaaah!

He starts chopping down his comic collection

The Scene cuts to Preston at the Comic Book store reading his comic owned by Borden comics

He Rips it up suddenly Topher comes to see him

Topher: Hey Preston ... Oh i know that look whats wrong?

Preston: Because I just realised I signed my soul away! My comic—it’s not even mine anymore.Borden Comics Owns  *everything*. They could turn it into a TV show, make action figures, and I wouldn’t see a dime

Topher:  Oof thats rough So… you’re saying they could make a Radioactive Lunch box A  Bobble head or a Dildo

Preston: Yes.

Topher: Dude thats fucked up didn't you read the contract?

Preston: I may have skimmed it

Topher: Pete Skimming contracts is for terms and conditions, not life-changing deals! So, uh, what the hell  are you gonna do about it now?

Preston: I don’t know! Can I undo it? Can I… can I steal it back? What do I do?

Topher: Unless you got some kind of Lawyer

Preston: Hm....

Preston then has an idea

Preston: I think i may know someone who can help

The Scene cuts to the court room

Balif: All rise Honorable Judge Richards

Judge Richards: Yeah lets get over i've got to attend to a freak off with the Mayor this evening We’re here today to hear the case of Preston Reinhold versus Borden Comics . Mr. Reinhold alleges that his intellectual property, *Radio Active Alien*

Preston: Its Robot!

Judge Richards: Whatever was unlawfully claimed by Borden . Let’s proceed. Mr. Reynolds, you may start

Preston: Thank you, Your Honor. My name is Preston Reinhold, and I’m the creator of Radio Active Robot  It’s a comic I poured my heart and soul into for years writing the story, designing every character, and even hand-drawing every panel. When I signed my publishing contract with Borden Comics, I didn’t know I was signing away all the rights to my work. I thought they’d just help me distribute it, not take it over completely. I wouldn’t have agreed to this if I had known

Judge Richards: Are you saying you didn't read the Contract Mr Reinhold

Preston: Nope I skimmed it… I mean, I trusted them! I didn’t have a lawyer at the time, and they made it sound like a partnership, not a takeover.

Felicia: I've got this Amiga Your Honor, if I may, the language in the contract is deliberately dense and misleading. Borden Comics  Press preyed on my client’s inexperience as an artist eager to publish his first comic. This is a classic example of exploitation

Judge Richards: Yeah yeah yeah we'll get to that soon Mr Publishman your response

Meanwhile Gert and Zaid are seen smoking dope until Gene knocks it out of their hands

Mark Publishman: Thank you, Your Honor. Borden Comics  operates under industry-standard contracts. Presto here signed the agreement willingly. We’ve invested heavily in *Radio Active* marketing, printing, distribution. Without us, it wouldn’t exist beyond his sketchbook. He’s trying to rewrite history because he regrets the deal he made

Preston: You Piece of shit!

Judge Richards: Thats enough  please continue

Mark Publishman: As i was saying Your Honor, we’ve followed all legal procedures. Presto simply wants to back out of a deal because the comic is now successful. This is nothing more than buyer’s remorse

Preston: I hate you so much \*Grits teeth\*

Judge Richards: Mr. Reinhold?, this is a serious accusation. Do you have any evidence to support your claim that you were misled?

Preston: I… I don’t have emails or anything. But I know they took advantage of me! I didn’t even get to keep creative control of my own characters

Judge Richards: Listen here pal Without concrete evidence, this is going to be difficult. Contracts are binding. Ms. Cartel, do you have anything substantial to prove coercion or deception?

Felicia: Si Your Honor, while we don’t have a smoking gun, the truth lies in the work itself. My client created every aspect of Green Robot boy

Preston: Are you serious right now!

Felicia:  Okay Geez sorry the characters, the art, the story lines. Mr. Kent claims to ‘own’ this creation, yet I’d wager he couldn’t even describe the characters in detail, let alone recreate

Judge Richards sleeps

Judge Richards:  \*Snores\* Oh uh..  ""And do you have a way to prove this?

Topher then walks up

Zaid: Aye its that white dude from the Game show

Topher: I got an idea If Mark  owns *Radio Active Robot* , let’s see him draw one of the character right here, right now!

Judge Richards: Who are you and why speaking out of turn

Topher: I’m Preston’s friend Look, all I’m saying is, if Mr. Publishman  really knows this comic, he should be able to draw the main character. But he can’t, because he didn’t create it!

They look at Mark

Mark Publishman: Well im not really an Artist Oversea the business side of things

Topher: Exactly Cock sucker because you didn't make it

Judge Reinhold: Okay do you believe you can recreate the character in question

Preston: You damn right i can your honour

Preston then takes the pencil and paper and draws Radio Active Robot

Felicia: Your Honor the talent and ownership are clear. My client not only created this work but continues to live and breathe it. Mr. Publishman, on the other hand, can’t even describe the character, let alone draw

He then turns to Mark

Judge Richards: Do you have anything to say in your defence Mr Publishman?

Mark Publishman: This is  This… this is Bullshit! We invested in this property! We… we made it what it is!""

Judge Richards: Okay shut up It’s clear to this court that *Radio Active*  is the intellectual property of Preston Reinhold Borden Comics  will immediately transfer all rights back to him. Case closed.

Mark Publishman: Its not fair its not fair

He then turns into a Parasite Monster

Seville: Holy shit this turned ugly fast

Preston then Morphs into Mega men Green Ranger and so does Topher and the rest of the other rangers

They 11 of them go outside to fight the Parasite Publisher

Preston uses his Mega Man Pixel Axe to slash Publishman but he grabs him and throws him

Parasite Publisher: You destroyed me in court now im going to destroy physically

Preston: Oh Boohoo

Topher uses his Magma  Sushi Cleavers to slash Publishman aswell

Ezekiel then turns Phantom mode to enter his body to control him

Parasite Publisher: Agh get the fuck out of me you weasel

Gert uses his Camp Blaster to shoot at Publishman but gets sprayed with Ooze

Gert: Woah!

Felicia Zaid Ravis and Seville also use their Weapons to attack but he's just too strong

Preston: Lets quickly end this Crash out

Preston quickly goes Mega Ultra Mode to spice things up

Zaid: Yeah fuck his Up Presto

Preston then aims directly at Publishman doing a huge blast

Preston: Bye Bye!

He fires it blasting him right off the atmosphere

Preston: And thats the last we ever see of that prick

The Ending Scene cuts to the Rangers all together

Topher: Looks like you got your happy ending huh?

Preston: Yeah, if by 'happy ending' you mean a courtroom showdown, public humiliation for a publisher, and me almost having a heart attack—then sure, Topher. A real fairy tale and i gotta say i owe you big time Felicia

Felicia: Just promise me you’ll read your contracts next time

Preston: You know i think im done with comics 

Topher: What now?

Felicia: wait back up done like done done?

Preston:  Yeah but the thing the  whole thing has been exhausting. The contracts, the lawsuits, the sleepless nights—it’s not what I signed up for. I think I’m gonna go back to my old shitty  job

Topher: Your old job? You mean the one where your Ass hole boss yelled at you for being one minute late and put you down about your dreams

Preston: Pretty much yeah

Seville: Jesus Man

Die-hard RE fan here since 2018. I would like to state that this is outwardly subjective but I've ranked a lot of it based on replayability.

S - RE2R is the best 3rd person shooter game ever made. Hands down. This is what really ignited my deep and fiery passion for the franchise, and the reason I love survival horror games so damn much.

RE4R is only slightly better than RE4, but that is an incredible accomplisment on it's own. 'nuff said.

RE4 is the 2nd best 3rd person shooter game ever made. I even got a dope ass Los Illuminados tattoo just because I love it so damn much. Anything I have to say about RE2R, RE4R, RE4 has been repeated ad-nauseoum, so I'm gonna move on to the others first.

RE1:DC is uber-goated and has effectively become underrated at this point. I played it with the ASCIIware Biohazard PS1 controller after years of not being able to click with the tank controls and once I tried it with that controller, everything made sense. The terrible voice acting is just so perfect for me, and the mechanics are perfect. It goes without saying that I prefer Jill to Chris's campaign, but his still fuckin' rocks.

RE5 is probably the game I have replayed the most, even more than every other game in my collection. The co-op experience is something seriously special, there really isn't anything like it. It goes without saying that the meme appeal is just as strong as OG RE1:DC for me, my job has random Wesker quotes and pictures hidden around the pharmacy that corporate saw and said nothing about. The most fun I've ever had getting a platinum for sure.

A - RE3R is a supremely unfairly hated kick-ass fucking game. I enjoy it so much more than the OG. The mechanics are tight and I think that the length is appropriate for the story it is trying to cover. Is it flawed? Absolutely, I think some of the cut content would've been nice to see in the remake setting, it was too cutscene heavy, and the removal of the branching story paths was a bit disappointing. Imagine the idea of a large map of city blocks with much more exploration, unsafe save rooms, and Nemesis (nightmare/inferno difficulty as standard) constantly up your ass with random encounters. That would have been next-level, but I understand that we can't always get the best-case scenario. I'm supremely happy with what we got; I've replayed it several times and even got the platinum.

RE2 is a masterpiece, simply put. Stacked up against the remake? It falls short for me mechanics and storywise in comparison to the remake. I chalk it up to the remake spoiling me, as I fully see why I'm a bit of a knucklehead for not putting the respect on the OG that it deserves, but it boils down to the replayability being hard to justify to my myself knowing that the remake I love so much is on my shelf in the other room. The item sharing mechanic was a bit frustrating, and the game can feel a bit sluggish a points in the later areas of the game leading up to the final countdown. I love the Dies Irae moment at the final Super Tyrant fight and I loved how the jumpscares for Mr. X really took me by surprise as I was expecting them where the remake has them. I can't really criticize OG RE2, it's a goddamn powerhouse of a classic but I just don't prefer it over the S ranked games, and the remake improved everything that this one does right.

RE7 is a fantastic modern horror game, and a really great setting/mechanic displacement for the franchise that as time has proved was much needed. I think it's worth noting how much more of a die-hard horror movie fan I am than RE, because the idea of an RE game filled to the brim with inspiration and references to Evil Dead (my favorite films of all time), Texas Chainsaw, Saw, etc. really tickles my fancy. But to me, I feel sad that it doesn't tickle said fancy more; I found myself a pinch underwhelmed after every playthrough. The 2nd half of the game has a pacing problem and I never found Ethan or Eveline all that great, granted Ethan has grown on me more and more in recent years. Mechanic and atmosphere-wise RE7 knocks it out of the goddamn park. It is so palpably disgusting, smelly, slimy and dessicated while balancing a great sense of humor with serious menace. RE7 is unique to me as it is one of the few RE games where none of the humor is really unintentional, but is consistently funny despite the pitch-black vibe and setting. RE7 isn't my favorite within the franchise, but it certainly earns it's place as a favorite within my favorite franchise for sure.

RE8 is more of the same with RE7, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I love the wackiness in the villians/setting while having a lot of fun with the boss-rush kind of pacing that the game uses. Also, RE8 Mercanaries is probably the best of the franchise. 'nuff said.

RE6 is ranked so high more for the happy memories with the people I've played it several times over. I know this game is... messy. I don't care. It's really really really fun. Visually, it's a mixed bag, but my general opinion is that while a wonderful spectacle of effort, it is way too busy on the eyes. Most of the enjoyment RE6 offers hinges on co-op, but it does that so damn well that it keeps me coming back for another good time with a homie. This is a game where I feel like it genuinely adds value to whatever console I'm playing it on. I got my money's worth dozens of times over with RE6 and I'll defend it for that alone.

B - RE3 is great (technically my first Resident Evil), but I've got a few bones to pick with this game, namely the fans. It's kind of shitty to judge a game based on it's fans, but y'all motherfuckers have put a sour taste in my mouth with this one. Every RE fan that has OG RE3 as their favorite game has been an either an asshole to me, an asshole in subreddits/forums, and/or an asshole when reviewing games. \*cough\* Jared \*cough\* What is it about this game that makes people into such gatekeepy snobs? This game was the most action based to date at that point in the franchise, but these are the same people that always hate on RE2R, RE3R, RE4 & RE4R, RE5, RE6, RE7, RE8 for being ""not Resident Evil"" or ""too actiony."" It's like their catchphrase. ""My favorite game in the franchise is RE3 and I think that RE\_\_ is not Resident Evil. <insert condescending comment>"" Enough about that.

I really love the way this one plays, it feels the tightest of the original trilogy as controls go. I also really dig the all the environments and settings. It still feels claustrophobic despite taking place in the city streets, and the doom hanging over the whole game is just so damn good. I love Jill and Carlos and Nemesis, they are some of my all-time favorite characters of the franchise, and I love the story too. The puzzles are some of the most worthy challenges I've faced in RE to date. They are also too goddamn tedious for their own good at points. This is the first game in the tier list where I can confidently say that the game is too goddamn long. This is a game that runs about 2 hours overtime and has some fat that can and ended up being cut for the remake. The bosses are really lame and feel unnecessary at points and the RNG for puzzles really puts me off doing any A rank runs. It was my first true Resident Evil game, but it's worth noting that I didn't really click with the franchise until several years later with RE2R. Great game, just not really one that I pick up and play all that often.

RE:UC/RE:DC/RE:S/RE:DA - I have a real soft spot for the light gun shooters, so I'm gonna clump them all together here.

RE:S in particular is a blast once you know what to do, playing with the ASCIIware Biohazard PS1 controller makes it really really fun, and the game was supposed to have GunCon support in the US but you can thank Eric and Dylan for why it doesn't, so give it a break. I do agree that it is a really stupid game. The voice acting, animations, story are all hilariously dogshit. But that's what I love about it, it's just a dumb-fun-so-bad-it's-good romp that never overstays it's welcome and feels really good to play with the right conditions.

I played DA with my GunCon 2, which made it just awesome. I love having to aim down sights and the movement feels really natural for RE and I love the eerie vibe. I don't care for the story or characters much; it being de-canonized makes perfect sense. However, it's unique gunplay and mechanics are just so damn fun despite their clunkyness that it deserves it's B rank.

UC was the 2nd RE game I ever played, granted it was my first exposure to the franchise when I was little. The Wii games are great fun with friends, have really vital lore, and great soundtracks, but the controls can be a bit fucky and the difficulty can feel unfair at points. I have a lot of good memories with these games but they aren't really what I go for in a Resident Evil game, despite their value.

RE: REV2 - This is probably my least favorite of the co-op games. I really do dig the ""return to Code Veronica"" feel this one has (despite my gripes with that one you'll see later) and it's use of characters feel soooo welcome, particularly Barry and Alex. The bosses are super fun, I love the setting, the replayability, and I think the T-Phobos virus is cool as fuck. Single-player holds up the best out of any of the other co-op RE games, but with both 1 or 2 players, it's still really boring at points and frustratingly clunky. Even for Resident Evil, this game is particularly fucking stingy with items, which for an action shooter with spongy enemies, makes it feel tedious as fuck at points. REV2 is really long with a lot of junk in it, and some of it feels on-rails in such a way that really takes me out of it. I still love this game, but when I go through the co-op games with friends, I always save this one last.

RE: REV, I don't have too much to say about this one. I love it. I don't love it that much, though. I found the gunplay really frustrating at points, like my weapons were all underpowered and dinky. The story is fun, I wish we had more BSAA B-team stuff show up in the other games. I'll play it again at some point; it was a damn good time but it suffers from being the worst of the best for me in the franchise for any of the canon games.

C - RE1R just doesn't do it for me. I know I'm finna get REAMED for this one, but I can't see myself putting it any higher or lower. My complaints for RE1R are brief and simple:

• Crimson Heads and the kerosene mechanic for RE1R completely ruined the flow and fun of the game for me.

• The new voice acting and dialogue lacks the charm of the original.

• Fuck that stupid doorknob.

• Fuck that stupid part with the walking-only part with Chimeras running around you.

• For whatever reason, the tank controls for this one have never felt right to me. They feel too slippery and unresponsive.

RE1R's got a good atmosphere, a great graphical/visual overhaul, and I really dig some of the additions to the lore and some of the puzzle changes, but I can't lie to myself about my feelings towards this game. Sure, it's objectively amazing but I never had a super great time with this one like the other games in the franchise. I don't dislike it or hate it. I know that most of my thoughts on this one are negative, but the positives are still there, It's still pure Resident Evil after all. I like this one, just don't love it.

RE:ORC. I never finished it, but I want to. I know the ending is stupid, but I enjoy this one for what it is. Maybe after a few complete playthroughs I may come to like it more. It feels broken and messy for sure though.

RE:M3D - I haven't finished it either, but I think it can be really fun until you reach a certain point. The first indication that something is wrong is where you are so desperate for any kind of boosts or help that you begin to shake your 3DS a few thousand times for play coins just to get weapons sets that can make things feel fair. The later stages are brutal and just feels too demanding of me. It's also not the most crucial of RE experiences, so I'd say I like it a lot, just really put off by it's difficulty.

RE:O1&2 are just too obtuse and clunky. I have tried several times to get through them but it feels so crushing and unintuitive. I'm sure with more patience I'll like them more, but for now I just feel indifferent to the experience they provide despite the admittedly interesting mechanics and what seems like a banger story.

RE:V was kinda fun. I liked playing as Nemesis and if it had popped off a bit more, I would still play it. The gameplay was ok at best, but my expectations weren't high for this to say the least so I wasn't disappointed. Overall, meh.

D - Ah yes, CV. Where do I begin? I'd like to say that this game being in D tier is based more on my experience with it. Just as a heads up, I played it on Dreamcast, but I doubt that the X version is really gonna sway my opinion here. I think that CV is at best, a great but flawed game from an objective standpoint, but for me, it was a stressful slog. I had been made aware of the game's notoriety as it pertains to that stupid fire hydrant, the sudden Chris switch over, the plane Tyrant, the luna moth hallway, mutated Steve, etc. but I still found myself being supremely hesitant to use any items I had in such a way that made me wonder if I was overdoing it, only to find myself validated by the end of the fucking game. If I were to play this game without a guide (I almost never use a guide for RE games) or without a heads up on the cheap fucking bullshit this game has up its sleeve, then I would hate it sooo much more than I do now. I hate that the game's difficulty is mostly based on the devs being dicks, RE is so much better than that and you know it. Getting the coveted A-rank for this one seems like such a Herculian task, like I'm seriously only allowed 4hrs and 30mins, can't use saves (other than the disc 2 switch over) and no retries!? Are you fucking with me? When I was thinking about what tier to put this in, I went ""Hmm, it's objectively good, but would I ever consider playing it again? Nope."" On the positive side, I love the story and how crucial to the lore this game is. RE5 and RE:REV2 pull so much from this game, not to mention how Capcom keeps bringing it up because they know no one played it. The 3D rendered backgrounds and camera are really well done, I love the knife and the shotgun, and Wesker is always awesome to see. I also love the music box theme; it's genuinely beautiful. For me, CV is just too much trouble than it's worth, and I really hate that. Definitely hoping for the remake.

RE: GS2 is one that've only played emulated for a mere 10 minutes or so. I wasn't impressed, but I'm sure that playing it on an arcade or using my GunCon 2 would be fun.

F - RE:G has been a thorn in my side for quite sometime. Sure, the things they did with the tech on the GameBoy was great, but this game fucking blows. Item distribution is awful, the exploration stinks, combat stinks worse, the game is just really unfun to play. I've really tried to beat this one just to say that I've done it but personally, its not worth it. I don't hate it though. It has good qualities and I had brief moments of fun.

RE:R (Resistance) was abominable on release. I really didn't enjoy how buggy and clunky the whole thing was. It felt like this big unfair clusterfuck with really short matches of silent teammates getting melted by the mastermind within minutes while you're still trying to get a feel for the game. I saw that towards the end of it's lifespan, it seemed a lot more polished and fun, but I was there at the beginning and was quickly put off.

UC is poo-poo. A huge nothing burger grilled on the flames of failure. I have little to say about this one other than it was a terrible, terrible mistake.

RE0 Tier - Oh my sweet holy beloved, fuck this game. I don't necessarily hate any of the other Resident Evil games, and I believe that all of them (this one included) have something good about them, but man does this game fucking suck fat monkey dicks. Blah, blah, blah ""hAtE tHe PlAyEr, NoT tHe GaMe,"" I don't care. I don't have to justify myself as an RE fan and my level of skill because I gave up on this wet burp. Let me just get the one positive out of the way, the train segment. It was fun. But I knew something was up when I saw that there were no item boxes. Wesker Mode looks fun, I guess, but it's not worth it what it takes to get it though.

Okay so, first off, the item distribution in this game is completely fucking rancid. On Easy, I was being conservative with health and still found myself in deep shit in need of a single herb the whole time. Those leech motherfuckers can suck my crusty anus, especially their mother too which by the way, I had to knife her ass for most of the fight because, yet again, the terrible item distribution. I hope the braindead doofus who designed the awful soft-locking monkeys from hell gets a steamy turd under his pillow one day. The church bat is a mistake against God. One of the absolute worst bosses I have ever fought against in a video game ever. Fuck that stupid bat. Fuck the story. I could not care less about Billy or Rebecca. Rebecca is cool later on, but how is she this Tyrant slaying badass in 0 but a dainty scaredy-cat in 1? Billy's backstory is lame, and they literally sent that chud to die in the woods or something. I know Rebecca cleared his name, but I don't care. The yodeling slug priest guy was beyond dumb. I love RE6 and that was too dumb for me. The lack of item boxes was completely terrible when paired with some of the worst placed camera angles in the series, not to mention having to run ALLLLLLL the back to previous areas for ONE fucking item. Backtracking is awesome until a certain point, and then it just becomes lazy and wastes my fucking time. Side note, it seems that the most difficult and bullshit RE games (I'm including Dino Crisis in this) had this fetish for trying to re-invent the wheel with item storage, and 0 seems to be the ultimate culmination of that. I can't with this game. The AI getting butt-fucked everytime I leave them alone for more than 5 minutes is so irritating, but when the game isn't farting in your face with all these mechanics; it's just boring. All the downtime in-game when you aren't getting face-fucked is literally like a narcoleptic's purgatory. I couldn't pinch any enjoyment out of anything RE0 had to offer past the train, and trust me, I've tried several times to. Fuck this game and the train it rode in on.

Byeeeee!"

"Going from Idea to Something ""Real"" - Our Frustrations and Successes (Case Study)",IndieDev,1i87oz4,2025-01-23 11:45:16,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1i87oz4/going_from_idea_to_something_real_our/,CadmusMaximus,Discussion,"I'm working with a small team that's making a mobile sports-based game. Love what I'm doing, and I've been writing up ""build in public""-type pieces for our newsletter. Thought you all might enjoy some of the frustrations we're facing, successes we're having, and otherwise gleaning some knowledge from what all we've been doing. Enjoy!

It’s one of business’s great paradoxes:

Every great business starts with an idea…

And yet **the idea is probably the least valuable part of the business.**

That goes doubly so for something like a video game, which is almost 100% entertainment-based.

I’m sure that millions of people have amazing ideas for new video games every day.

Heck, you’ve probably had one or more in the shower (why is it always in the shower?).

Personally, someday, I’d like to revive the classic MS-DOS game *Airbucks*, where you run an airline from 1945 to 1995. You negotiate with cities… buy planes… start routes… it’s really fun for a commercial airline nut like me…

But “an idea” isn’t going to make itself.

Anyone can have an idea.

It’s the execution that’s the valuable part.

And there is a nuance there that I think is valuable to explore.

Once you know this, you can avoid a lot of potential pain and expense, “sharpen the axe” with your idea quicker, and pivot faster as you get new information.

**Let’s Take an Example From the World of Video Games**

A game idea can be as simple as “Candy Crush but with baked goods instead of candy.”

And it can go way up in complexity from there.

For example, when the first Dragon Warrior game was made, how would you describe it?

“Well, there’s action, but it’s not like Galaga or Mario… you get into fights with monsters and fantasy creatures and then take turns… your character earns XP, which they can use to level up…”

From a pure gameplay perspective, it’s pretty nuts. 

Of course, something more like “It’s a video game version of Dungeons and Dragons” makes it a lot more “concrete” in other peoples’ minds.

But there’s still a lot of room for interpretation as to what “a video game version of Dungeons and Dragons” *actually* means too.

Think about all of the ways that game could go *wrong*.

Dare I say that a bunch of folks *tried* to do it right before… and yet Dragon Warrior was really the first blockbuster RPG ever made.

The difference between “Candy Crush but with baked goods instead of candy” and “The first RPG ever built” is staggering.

“Candy Crush clone” definitely has a validated market… but it’s going to be fighting for market share with, you know, *Candy Crush*.

Not to mention that it has to have something new or different to bring to the table besides “OH LOOK PASTRIES!!”... if you want to market it properly.

But it’s *real*. It’s something that people can wrap their heads around, for good or ill.

But “Dragon Warrior” was brand-new. It was genre-defining. It was a “big swing.”

And if you have something brand-spanking-new… it’s much tougher for folks to visualize.

So **if you have a potentially transformative game, but there’s no real analog in the industry right now, you’re going to have to MAKE it real for everyone!**

The crazier or “newer” the idea, the more work you’ll have to do to make the idea seem “real” in peoples’ minds.

We’ve done this for Super Streak in a variety of ways (we will go into each in a lot more detail in future weeks):

* We’ve built two separate MVPs on different platforms.
* We’ve invested a bunch of time and effort into documentation, explaining game mechanics, economy, style, backstory–you name it, The Beard has a doc for it.
* We’ve validated the marketing strategy (and learned a bunch along the way)
* We’ve spent a good amount on design / Figma, working through a demo of what the game will look like (I’m going to share that soon–it’s fixin’ to be like Christmas that day!)
* And we’ve talked with dozens of Dev Houses about bringing this vision to life.

The price tag?

It’s hefty. Pushing six figures now.

And we need a *lot* more to bring this vision to light in the way we intend to.

(Side Note: It’s going to be f$%#ng awesome when we do!)

And a *lot* more to spread the word about it once it’s out there…

When the Beard, Stache, and the Professor thought of “gamified free-to-play sports betting,” I’m pretty sure they didn’t realize the big, hairy, red Bugs Bunny monster this thing would become so far.

It was the most expensive lightbulb Beard had ever seen. At least up-front.

**You have to invest a lot of time, money, and (yes) emotion into this process to turn an idea into “something real.”**

And even when you do?

It *still* might kick you in the groin like Kevin McAllister and go “Sorry! Just kidding! There’s something here… but try *this* instead…”

You need to iterate, refine, and refresh your idea… which is *incredibly tough* if you’ve already spent a bunch of time, money, and emotion on getting it off the ground.

You might discover that you’re not the “first mover” in a given genre.

For example, when Brown Bag Games was in its earlier stages, the original goal was something more akin to what Stadium Live and Fliff are doing now.

Basically a “free-to-play” sports book.

But because they were first, we were able to identify the holes in their products…

…figure out amazing new differentiators for our game…

…and otherwise get to the position where we’re building something that’s “sort of” in the same ocean as those guys… but with enough wrinkles and “newness” that it’s a completely different experience for a different audience.

This is the “Second Mover Advantage” that you see so often, where the first one to market has success… but is then ousted by a Second Mover that does something better.

Think MySpace / Facebook, or Atari / Nintendo, or Nintendo / Sony.

(Ok that last one may still be up for debate).

The crazy thing is that **if you end up being a second mover in a space, it can cause you to edit your idea enough to where you do become a first-mover again in a whole different space.**

If you *do* put in the blood… sweat… tears… and enough brainpower to light up the Matrix for a decade…

The end result is potentially game-changing.

There are no guarantees, though… and the art of the pivot is a topic of its own.

More on that next time… for now, here are the key takeaways from this week (I’m leaving them “raw” to show you they weren’t done with ChatGPT… not that there’s anything wrong with that…):



* **It all starts with an idea, but in a way the “idea” is the least valuable part of the business**  
* **Idea – Dragon Warrior vs. “Reskin Candy Crush.” “Make a game out of D&D-style tabletop games.” Dragon Warrior was genre-defining. But imagine the** ***worst*****-executed version of that idea. It can go VERY wrong.**   
* **The crazier or more “unique” the idea, the more real YOU are going to have to make it!**  
* **As you spend time, effort, and money to validate the idea, the whole enterprise becomes more valuable because you are derisking it.**  
* **Even validating the idea is difficult - examples from web app, marketing, etc.**  
* **It’s ok if other competitors are in the space–it does validate the idea somewhat. But then differentiate–you need this for marketing anyway. And the Second Mover Advantage is real.**  
* **As you get feedback on your idea, iterate, refine, and reassess.**



Thanks for reading, let me know if there's interest here and I'll continue the series.
