Section IV.M.2.a.xx: Marinade (MNDE)  
  
The Ascendance of Marinade (MNDE) in the DeFi Ecosystem  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis delves into the recent surge of interest and activity surrounding Marinade (MNDE), a liquid staking solution on the Solana blockchain. Highlighting its recent listing on Coinbase, we explore how this move has catalyzed both liquidity and investor interest. The paper examines MNDE's staking mechanism, offering insights into its innovative approach that allows for native staking with high returns, alongside the implications of its governance model through the Marinade DAO. We analyze market performance, community engagement, and the token's integration within the broader DeFi ecosystem, emphasizing its role in enhancing Solana's staking capabilities. Additionally, we discuss the security protocols ensuring user trust and the regulatory landscape that could shape its future trajectory. This abstract encapsulates the multifaceted aspects of MNDE's growth, its impact on market trends, and what this might signify for the future of liquid staking in decentralized finance.

Some of the lesser known may be anywhere from 10-20x potential.

I did that a while ago when marinade had rewards and I just kept it there even after it ended. 


But now I wonder if that's the best strategy, I am thinking of moving my SOL back to vanilla staking. 


I would also like to diversify where I keep my SOL, but I  open to suggestions. 


Any suggestion? 


(I am only really interested SOL or strong liquid tokens, not new projects). "
Staking MNDE on marinade ,solana,1f34gsm,2024-08-28 03:49:53,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1f34gsm/staking_mnde_on_marinade/,GoodmanSimon,DeFi,"So, I have some MNDE and I can see the market is going to be up and down for the next 2 or 3 months. 


So I was thinking of staking my coins. 


Do we get any rewards for staking or is it just for governance? 


I couldn't find any APR information, so my guess is that it is for voting.


What else could I do with my MNDE?



Edit: The amount of scammers trying to contact me is astounding...


Be careful guys, never click any links and never trust any DMs. "

"Marinade Leads Solana DeFi Resurgence, Crosses $2 Billion TVL Milestone",solana,1bikvua,2024-03-19 09:57:23,7,0.9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1bikvua/marinade_leads_solana_defi_resurgence_crosses_2/,Rare-Bridge839,DeFi," [Marinade](https://twitter.com/MarinadeFinance), a leading staking platform on the Solana blockchain, has recently achieved a historic milestone by surpassing $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) for the first time since its launch in 2021. This remarkable feat positions Marinade as the top protocol on Solana by TVL, showcasing the project's growing popularity and the Solana ecosystem's resilience. Further fueling the excitement, Marinade's governance token, [$MNDE, surged 16% Monday Morning](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mnde/), reflecting the surge in TVL and the growing confidence in the protocol.

Marinade offers flexible staking solutions that cater to different user preferences, promoting decentralization by distributing stake across a diverse set of validators. Users can choose between liquid staking with mSOL tokens for easy DeFi integration and earning additional yield or opt for Marinade Native for a more hands-off approach with lower fees and direct staking rewards.

While Solana was under heavy criticism a year ago, the ecosystem is now thriving, with Marinade being a prime example. Following the collapse of FTX, a major supporter of the Solana ecosystem, the blockchain faced intense scrutiny and negative press. Critics claimed that Solana lacked developer support and was on the verge of collapse. However, the determined builders within the Solana community, including teams like Marinade, remained steadfast in their belief in the blockchain's potential. Their unwavering commitment to innovation and advancement is now paying dividends, as evidenced by their rapid growth.

In an interview with SolanaFloor, [Brandon Tucker, a core contributor at Marinade](https://twitter.com/BrandonTucker), shared insights on the protocol's journey and the broader Solana ecosystem's recovery. ""Following the FTX incident, Marinade, along with other pioneering Solana protocols, doubled down on development, leading to the introduction of enhanced features and a reinvigorated dApp. The Solana blockchain has since undergone substantial improvements, offering users a significantly enhanced experience. We're excited to welcome a growing number of new and returning users as they explore the advancements within the Solana ecosystem,"" said Tucker.

Solana's DeFi market share is rapidly growing, fueled by innovative projects like Marinade that offer user-friendly and secure staking solutions. Beyond DeFi, Solana is making groundbreaking progress in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure Network), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) industries, emerging as a key player at the forefront of technological advancements. With its high speed, scalability, and low transaction fees, Solana is well-positioned to empower a new wave of users and make mass adoption a reality.¬†"

Marinade Finance has a TVL of $1.24 billion, whereas Jito had a TVL of $726 million.

Jito (JTO) has a higher market capitalization and token price than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has more demand and valuation. 

So, it has less marketcap but it is more expensive.

Jito (JTO) offers a lower annual percentage yield (APY) than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has less rewards for staking Solana (SOL). 6.9% APY for jito versus 9.1% APY for marinade.

Jito (JTO) has some additional features that Marinade Finance (MNDE) does not have, such as its block building engine and MEV infrastructure, which could give it an edge in the long term. Jito also had a successful token launch and airdrop, which boosted its popularity and exposure.

Sentiment is on jito's side and it is on binance and coinbase, but marinade is only on coinbase. Feel free to add technical analysis, perhaps something weekly.

Help me find my Solana - offering 10% reward!,solana,18akrjr,2023-12-04 08:58:58,7,0.66,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/18akrjr/help_me_find_my_solana_offering_10_reward/,Adaank,Staking,"Hey all,

I‚Äôve been trying to locate my 16 Solana, but to no avail. I had originally staked my Solana with Marinade. In returned I received the MNDE governance token as well as mSOL collateral.

I staked mSOL on the Quarry protocol through Saber, but took my tokens off that platform more than a year ago. Now, I can‚Äôt find where I‚Äôve put them ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

When I learned of the synthetify hack I panicked, because I recall looking at staking with their platform. However, I don‚Äôt see any deposits to Synthetify in my wallet history.

The last activity I found was a swap of my MNDE governance tokens for a small amount of SOL. Did my swapping the governance token somehow lose my staked SOL and mSOL collateral? I was under the impression that as long as I had custody of the mSOL, I could return mSOL for staked Solana tokens on Marinade.

I really don‚Äôt know where the 16 remaining solana tokens can be found. Here is my wallet on solscan. I will gladly send you 1.6 Sol if you help me recover these funds. I know it‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs what I have to offer. 

Thank you so much.

"Markets Pro delivers up to 1,123% ROI with quant-style crypto analysis for investors",expay24,zl1fzp,2022-12-13 12:30:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/zl1fzp/markets_pro_delivers_up_to_1123_roi_with/,Expay-24,,"Since [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://pro.cointelegraph.com/?via=markets) launched ‚Äî bringing professional crypto market intelligence to every investor ‚Äî the platform has helped thousands of subscribers to better understand the opportunities and threats inherent in the world of crypto investing and trading.

In this brief, we want to draw attention to some highlights since the platform‚Äôs launch, including a critical look at a variety of backtested strategies that the Markets Pro team tracks.

Cointelegraph Markets Pro consists of two unique research features ‚Äî VORTECS Score and NewsQuakes ‚Äî in addition to a wide variety of market performance metrics and access to a vibrant community of crypto enthusiasts on Discord.

VORTECS Score
------

The VORTECS Score is derived from an algorithm that examines multiple variables, including sentiment, tweet volume, price volatility and trading volume, and it compares those with historically similar market conditions.

The algorithm is capable of parsing through millions of historical data points each day, comparing what‚Äôs going on right now with prior conditions for the 418 assets and counting that are currently tracked.

A high VORTECS Score suggests that current market conditions across all of the tracked variables are similar to conditions in the past when the asset appreciated during the next several days. The higher the score, the more consistent the behavior of the asset‚Äôs price in the past.

History doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. The VORTECS Score was created to provide every crypto market participant with high-quality, quantitative analysis that has previously only been available to major institutional investors.

NewsQuakes
----------

NewsQuakes is an indicator that delivers real-time alerts generated by developments that impact coin prices the most. These include exchange listings, staking announcements and partnerships.

Our research has found that exchange listings, staking announcements and partnership announcements have had the most consistently positive impact.

NewsQuakes are built on top of The Tie‚Äôs proprietary SigDev technology ‚Äî the most comprehensive and actionable digital asset information platform for tracking real-time, market-moving news in the cryptocurrency space.

SigDev is used by major hedge funds, over-the-counter desks, market makers and other institutional market participants to gain an edge. In addition to financial institutions, news outlets like Cointelegraph use The Tie‚Äôs SigDev platform to identify critical breaking news stories from primary sources.

NewsQuakes are delivered both in-browser via Discord alerts and directly to your phone via the Markets Pro mobile application. Among the most notable NewsQuakes are new exchange listings.

For example, since the launch of our NewsQuakes indicator in Jan. 2021, buying and holding a token for one hour after its NewsQuakes listing announcement generated a whopping 12,000% return!

Some notable NewsQuakes over the past month include our alert on Mask Network (MASK) after the announcement that MASK would be listed on Binance.

The yellow dot illustrates when the alert was sent to community members‚Ä¶Just four days after the alert, MASK rose from $2.67 to a high of $3.93.

Similarly, three NewsQuake alerts were sent to our clients about Marinade (MNDE), the last two served up a one-day move from $0.07 to a high of $0.30, translating to a 307% intraday move.

Meaning, had you invested $1,000 into this alert, you would‚Äôve had $3,070 by the end of the day.

$10,000? $30,700!

VORTECS performance
------------

Since the launch of the algorithm on January 5, 2021, [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://pro.cointelegraph.com/?via=markets) has been tracking the performance of 45 different trading strategies on an hourly basis over a rolling week and a cumulative history.

The trading strategies are divided into two groups: time-based and score-based.

In each case, Markets Pro tracks the performance of the VORTECS Score against the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and an evenly weighted basket of the top 100 altcoins ‚Äî all to ensure that the score is tested for wider market movements.

Time-based strategies
---------------------

Time-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS Score crosses a key threshold until a specific time period elapses, for example, Buy 80/Sell 168 hours or Buy 90/Sell 24 hours.

From the beginning of 2021 until now, the 13 winning time-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro have averaged gains of 546.35%. In comparison, a BTC buy-and-hold strategy suffered a loss of 39.44%, and a similar strategy with the top 100 altcoins gained a return of 190.15%.

The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 80/Sell 24 hours strategy, which has returned 1,123.46% since the beginning of 2021!

Even the least successful time-based strategy, Buy 80/Sell 168 hours, returned 290.70%.

Score-based strategies
----------------------

Scored-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS Score crosses a key threshold until it reaches another key threshold, for example, Buy 80/Sell 75 or Buy 90/Sell 65.

The 12 winning score-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro yielded an average return of 2,895.49%, eclipsing the 190.15% return achieved by buying and holding the top 100 altcoins on the market by a factor of 15.

The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 80/Sell 20 score, which has returned 21,010.61% since the beginning of 2021!

Even the least successful score-based strategy, Buy 85/Sell 85, returned 263.63%. Evidently, even the worst-performing successful score-based strategy beat the buy-and-hold strategies for BTC and for the top 100 altcoins on the market.

So I utilized the liquid staking option through Solflare and received my MSol, which was quite some time ago. Around 6 weeks ago, I connected my Solflare wallet with their partner, Marinade. I decided to stake the MSol through Marinade (receiving MNDE in return) to boost the return...Everything has been fine up until now, as I just hopped into the Marinade app. It shows what my MSol deposit what, and it shows I continue to accumulate MNDE, but when I click the Unstaking option, it doesn't show any MSol being available to Unstake? Is anyone else having this issue or has something happened to my funds?"

Roughly 75% of all locked MNDE has not voted on Marinade's validator Gauges,solana,vz236l,2022-07-14 13:58:07,19,0.88,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/vz236l/roughly_75_of_all_locked_mnde_has_not_voted_on/,cogent_crypto,DeFi,"As said in the title roughly 75% of the MNDE still hasn't voted on the validator guages. Total locked MNDE can be seen here [https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/](https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/)  (72,597,652**)**and total pointed towards validators here [https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/nftgauges/validator](https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/nftgauges/validator)  (18,739,695)   


I know some of the MNDE holders are also on reddit so I'd like to make the case of why MNDE holders should point their MNDE towards Cogent Crypto.   


 **So why should you vote for Marinade to give bonus stake to Cogent?** Two primary reasons:  
 

**1)** I have been an active member of this community and an ambassador for mSOL staking since the very beginning. This is evidenced by a few things. First and foremost the staking guides I have written, [https://medium.com/@Cogent\_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-1-6a6a85f07b56](https://medium.com/@Cogent_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-1-6a6a85f07b56) and [https://medium.com/@Cogent\_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-2-advance-staking-strategies-335337b77ec9](https://medium.com/@Cogent_Crypto/solana-staking-guide-part-2-advance-staking-strategies-335337b77ec9). In these articles I talk about Marinade and detail many examples of how you can use mSOL in Defi and help increase decentralization while also making significant earnings over native staking. I even went the extra mile and wrote a lending calculator defaulted to leveraged staking with mSOL [https://cogentcrypto.io/LendingAPYCalculator](https://cogentcrypto.io/LendingAPYCalculator)   
 

Secondarily, I also built the MNDE calculator that has helped validators and potential new MNDE holders see exactly how much MNDE it takes to get a specific amount of SOL staked to a validator [https://cogentcrypto.io/MNDECalculator](https://cogentcrypto.io/MNDECalculator)  
 

**2)** Our Validator has highest APY on Solana averaged over the last 10 epochs and in the current epoch a close third out of 1900 + validators. [https://cogentcrypto.io/Validators](https://cogentcrypto.io/Validators) This high APY is achieved by deploying significant software and hardware optimizations that I believe increase the overall performance of Solana by just voting better and sooner then the stock software. (to see last 10 epoch performance see [stakeview.app](https://stakeview.app) and select last 10)  
 

Having marinade delegate more stake to top performing validators like cogent increase the apy performance of mSOL while also helps increase marinade TVL and MNDE value ultimately helping pump your bags :)"
When will Persistence's liquid staking ecosystem reach crypto-wide adoption?,PersistenceOne,v655ff,2022-06-06 10:44:28,10,0.87,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersistenceOne/comments/v655ff/when_will_persistences_liquid_staking_ecosystem/,AverageRedditLad,Discussion,"Let's face it - getting a considerable amount of TVL (more than $1B) it's not easy. Osmosis is one of the DeFi products I use the most, and at one point, it had approximately $1.8B, and it's now as low as $235M. Osmosis is the number one dApp in the Cosmos Ecosystem, and it struggles to maintain a $1B TVL. From my point of view, this is because its doors are only open to IBC-enabled chains, limiting the amount of TVL that can flow into the DEX.

Persistence is aware of these limitations and thus is trying to bring more chains into IBC via pSTAKE by bridging AVAX, BNB, SOL, and ETH to the Persistence chain. Today, the market cap of all these combined is approximately $300B. That's way more than all IBC-enabled chains combined. These tokens, plus ATOM and XPRT, could propel Persistence's TVL higher than any IBC-enabled protocol.

Of course, pSTAKE has fierce competition in the liquid staking game, but none of them is looking to build an ecosystem of liquid staking solutions. How does this bring more value to XPRT holders? By being the centerpiece of every product in the liquid staking ecosystem. The success and TVL of the Persistence ecosystem will directly impact XPRT's price. Every product in the Persistence ecosystem (DEX, borrowing/lending app) is centered around XPRT.

As far as I'm aware, the main competition is Lido Finance and Marinade Finance. While I don't know much about these, a quick search on coinmarketcap.com reveals that [Marinade's token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mnde/) is at approximately $10M market cap while [Lido Finance's DAO token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-dao/) is at $340M. This shows that while these liquid staking protocols have a lot of TVL, their token doesn't have much utility. Persistence and their XPRT token will fix this.

My question is: why would anyone want to buy into other liquid staking protocols if XPRT's value will be directly correlated with Persistence's success? There's nothing like this at the moment."

Huge news for Solana and the validator community - Marinade launches Validator gauges!,solana,uszh7l,2022-05-19 05:22:42,31,0.96,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/uszh7l/huge_news_for_solana_and_the_validator_community/,SolanaChef,Staking,"**Hey all Solana fans! Big news for the whole Solana network today :)**

Marinade, the largest stake pool with one of the absolute largest impact on securing and decentralizing the Solana network has released the ""validator gauges"" which means that one can vote with locked MNDE tokens (Marinade Chef NFT) on directing stake to a specific validator! 10% of the total stake to the stake pool will be used for the validator gauges, and the super minority is of course excluded.

Why should you boost validators' SOL stake with your locked MNDE? Independent validators must promote themselves and attract a lot of SOL from different sources (including stake pools) to earn enough stake to break even and keep the network censorship-resistant and running. Here are just a few examples and reasons why you should support a validator with the use of the validator gauges:  


üîπ You want to further support the validator's high performance or commission model  
üîπ The validator contributes to the same communities as you  
üîπ The validator has built free Web3 tools you've found useful  
üîπ You've noticed the validator advocate for Solana in other channels  
üîπ The validator has helped you with a DeFi or crypto question personally.

Marinade Governance Proposal for Validator Gauges,solana,tnx3fh,2022-03-25 15:31:13,12,0.94,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/tnx3fh/marinade_governance_proposal_for_validator_gauges/,fight_the_hate,Staking,"So we all know Solana needs validators to increase decentralization, but did you know it takes 5,000 SOL to start one up today? It's critical to all of Solana that this changes.     


There is a lot of stake locked up in the super minority right now among the OG validators and we need to do more and fast to spread that out. A new proposal in the Marinade DAO is live in their forum ([https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-voting-on-validators-stake-using-on-chain-gauges-through-the-mnde-token/107](https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-voting-on-validators-stake-using-on-chain-gauges-through-the-mnde-token/107)) about gauging for stake through the MNDE token, which imo provides several interesting aspects to both Marinade as a stake pool, but also for the validator community.    


Some highlights:  

1. Could lower the cost of entry for a validator 
2. Could allow a validator to be completely compensated within marinade rather then having to secure outside stake 
3. MNDE token having both governance and this additional utility should in theory provide fundamental underlying value to the token?  

This has potential to provide an easier path to start up a validator together with the Solana foundation grants setup and also help existing validators be sustainable. Initial feedback on the forum seems promising."

Benefits of holding the MNDE token?,solana,t60nei,2022-03-03 15:17:56,13,0.89,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/t60nei/benefits_of_holding_the_mnde_token/,tspicybrown,DeFi,"I use Marinade finance to stake some SOL, and am quite fond of the protocol, but I'm a little confused as to the benefits on the MNDE token. I'm currently receiving some MNDE by lending mSOL in Defi, and I'm wondering if it's worth holding onto the MNDE, or just swapping the tokens out for something else (which is what I think, at this point, I am more likely to do).

As far as price appreciation goes, I think I would rather just hold SOL than MNDE, but I'm wondering about the utility of the MNDE token. I found a description of the token on Moralis Academy that says... 

""Holders of the MNDE token will be able to participate in protocol governance via the Marinade DAO. Plus, the MNDE token incentivizes early adopters, contributors, and builders.""

Perhaps someone can ELI5 the quote above and shred some light on how users of Marinade Finance can benefit from holding their utility token. Thanks!"

[Marinade DAO NFT ](https://i.redd.it/jy7j4pacs0l81.gif)

Those of you on Solana have probably heard of mSOL and liquid staking. Marinade DAO is getting ready to launch a governance model using NFTs. By the sound of it, when you lock the MNDE tokens you get a unique NFT art back. And when you unlock the art is burned. BURN that octopus lmao!

Anyways this is the first time I've heard of this locking model for DAOs. Are there others? The NFT carries the locked tokens in it. According to their [post](https://medium.com/marinade-finance/cooking-with-governance-introducing-marinade-non-fungible-chefs-8af7e54871ac) they are using Tribeca governance on backend."

Huge upside for 3 Solana smallcaps?,solana,t0i9ek,2022-02-24 13:47:32,9,0.85,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/t0i9ek/huge_upside_for_3_solana_smallcaps/,Greedy_Beyond_6547,Ecosystem,"It is just about that time for some bottom feeding and I've got stables ready to dip into smallcaps. When you look at the [Solana ecosystem on Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/?asset_platform_id=solana) it's clear the coins are oversold vs ETh chain. As Coinbase adds SPL tokens and the market bottoms out this spring we will see more exposure to Solana projects and hopefully they will get more serious about utility after building good platforms. Here are three picks I'm eyeing with very low market caps. talk me out of it haha 

**RIN**: [Aldrin](https://dex.aldrin.com/restrictedRegion) is a new DeFi protocol with an ambitious mission and platform with a catchy tag line about cutting your working life in half (not available in US though yet?). For a new project their app is pretty robust and they have a solid team. Market cap is just $11 million and dropping. New projects seem to dump in the beginning so i'm watching for entry for now. 

**PORT**: Solid DeFi protocol we all know that has been around for a little bit with a marketcap under $5 million. I like the [roadmap](https://port.finance/#road-map) but they haven't really posted much on token utility yet so might be early here. Tough to stack when you're not sure what the token does tho 

  
**MNDE**: Based on their [last](https://medium.com/marinade-finance/cooking-with-governance-introducing-marinade-non-fungible-chefs-8af7e54871ac?source=rss------cryptocurrency-5) article it seems like Marinade is positioning to be a kind of DAO of Solana with emphasis on health and censorship resistance making all our SOL/msol more valuable. Validators and whales may want a piece of this DAO. market cap around $10 mil. they've articulated utility well but can mnde get out of the mSOL shadow?

I'm bullish af on Solana and hope the money stops pouring into NFTs and back into protocols soon!"

By reserving SOL tokens to provide liquidity instead of staking it, aren't I taking on impermanent loss risk AND getting a lower APY? What's the benefit of participating in this LP?

getting msol and staking msol in solend for more apy?,solana,ri0hw7,2021-12-16 16:18:30,6,0.88,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/ri0hw7/getting_msol_and_staking_msol_in_solend_for_more/,realwealthK,Staking,"Hello,

I looked through the threads and tried to understand better, but still unsure if what I'm thinking is correct.

let's say today, as of Dec 15, 2021, [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance) is offering 6.67% if you stake and get msol.

With that msol, if I go to solend and stake msol, it gives 3.12% (slnd, mnde rewards).

Does it mean that I am getting 9.79% in total?

I'm planning to convert slnd and mnde into msol each month and compound.

I'm looking to relatively safer options to stake and thus far this seems one of the safest way to stake.

or is staking msol at solend giving up my 6.67% staking rewards and only getting 3.12% rewards from solend?

I'm also staking part of it at francium for straight sol apy reward as well, just to diversify.

&#x200B;

If someone can help me clarify this for me, or suggest another way for me to stake with relatively low risk, it would be greatly appreciated."

The two options I've been looking at are providing to the mSOL/SOL LP on ORCA vs lending on Solend. Does anyone have thoughts on which one is more suitable? The estimated APR on ORCA rn is 8.72% while lending mSOL on Solend is .08% + 1.24% SLND + 5.03% MNDE.

My understanding here is that risk of IP loss is significantly less since mSOL and SOL are highly correlated. If I did go the LP option, I would have to maintain roughly equal amounts of SOL and mSOL right? Versus if I lend on Solend I can stake all my SOL into mSOL."
Question about Marinade and LPs,solana,r50ovq,2021-11-29 12:21:06,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/r50ovq/question_about_marinade_and_lps/,SKOtoGO,DeFi,"Hello. I feel like I am missing something in my understanding, so reaching out to the community for some guidance. 

These are the steps I have completed thus far:

\-Staked SOL for mSOL in Marinade

\-Added liquidity to Raydium (ex. mSOL-USDC)

\-Staked LP tokens in corresponding farm (mSOL-USDC LP)

Now, I can see my farms generating a reward (typically in MNDE), but I am failing to see how this will generate better returns than simply staking SOL for mSOL. I understand that the mSOL to SOL conversion is supposed to increase with each epoch, but is this based on the amount I have staked personally? Or is it just a general increase for all people who are staking? If I unstake from the LP's, will it become clearer for me? As you can see - I have confused myself. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I see that in the roadmap it has plans for ecosystems integration. Whatever that means since my brain isn't that wrinkled to know it.

Coins/tokens like MNDE, what is the actual use of it? Where does the value of the token come from? Everyone stakes in marinade because of the compound usage that they can give to their SOL.

Increasing your SOL bag safely!,solana,qnq9jv,2021-11-05 21:59:50,10,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/qnq9jv/increasing_your_sol_bag_safely/,cowsforyou,Staking,"With SOL crossing its ATH not too long ago I believe we have many new additions to the Solana family. Welcome!

There's a lot of great things going on in the Solana ecosystem and I encourage you to check out the dApps! I am personally love Solana due to the fast speeds and ultra low cost.

But if you are interested purely in growing your SOL bag without too much risk, here's the TL;DR:

1. Stake your SOL. Staking helps to secure the ecosystem. However, many people don't know which validators to choose and you don't want to stack on a few big validators either. This is where liquid staking comes in - liquid staking allows your stake to move between validators. You can easily liquid stake by converting your SOL to mSOL via Marinade Finance. Holding the mSOL token means you'll be getting the native 6-7% APR from normal staking, but auto compounded!
2. Provide liquidity for the mSOL-SOL liquidity pool! For those new to DeFi, liquidity pools are what allows people to swap between tokens (as opposed to an order book on an exchange). Each time someone uses the pool, they pay a small fee. If you provide liquidity, you get a share of the fees! On Marinade it gives you about 12% currently so that's in ADDITION to your native 6-7% native staking. You'll be holding half mSOL and half SOL in this instance, so the net native staking will only be half. However, your total APR will still be an impressive \~15%.
3. Throw that mSOL-SOL liquidity token into the farm! The mSOL-SOL LP farm is currently giving 3-4%. The payout is in MNDE so if you want to really just get pure SOL you'll have to manually compound that yourself by changing MNDE -> SOL -> back into the LP. Total APR = \~18%

If you want to venture further, there's lots of other ways like a SOL-USDC pool or even mSOL-USDC pool. However, you'll have to factor in impermanent loss (not terrible in most scenarios, but it's a risk nonetheless). If you are interested in these higher APR farms, some decent DEXes are Raydium and Orca. Some of them are giving a whooping >300% for decent pairs.

To the rest of the seasoned Solana fam - chip in if you have more ideas!

All the best!"
Marinade Liquid Staking; Am I Doing It Right?,solana,qlwnyt,2021-11-03 11:16:09,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/qlwnyt/marinade_liquid_staking_am_i_doing_it_right/,Sea-Bus3924,Staking,"Hoping someone can confirm/ clear up some confusion about liquid staking on Marinade.finance for me: 

Can I stoke SOL for mSol and earn the ~6.6% yield on the mSol, WHILE I am also using that full mSol to stake it in the MNDE stake which earns ~3.6% MNDE tokens? If that is a yes, where can I see that I am still earning mSol that I staked from my SOL? 

I am seeing Zero mSol staked in the wallet because all of this msol is then staked for MNDE - but after 1 full epoch, the amount of msol I can unstake from the MNDE did not increase, leading me to think I did not get any msol rewards on my staked Sol. 

Am I missing something here? I thought the advantage of marinade finance is that you can get additional yield on staked msol?"

Ecosystem REVIEW - Thoughts on a Few Protocols,solana,q9ytga,2021-10-17 09:33:30,6,0.8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/q9ytga/ecosystem_review_thoughts_on_a_few_protocols/,Rumiii,Ecosystem,"GM sers,

There doesn't always to seem to be much content here that's not ""y sol no go up?"", so wanted to describe my experience with a few DeFi protocols, plus thoughts on another project i've looked at a bit. Maybe it'll be helpful to a few of you. If anyone believes I've written anything that is incorrect, please let me know and I'll be happy correct.

**Liquid Staking Protocols:** I've used [marinade.finance](https://marinade.finance/) and [socean.fi](https://socean.fi/). Marinade has around $1.2bn TVL, Socean about $70m. Idea is you put sol in, get msol/SOCN token out. The protocol then stakes the SOL with validators, and stake rewards accrue to msol/SOCN token, with the idea being that you get more SOL back out when you redeem. The bigger idea is you are able to retain liquidity while getting involved with staking at the same time. Another selling point is they spread the stake out across a wide basket of validators (with more allocated to top performers), which is good for decentralization and censorship resistance.

* **What I like:** Liquidity is nice if I want the option to exit to USDC fast, while retaining some upside from staking.
* **What I dislike:** Fees are too high, particularly for SOCN which charges a 15bps deposit fee. Between 15bps deposit and 30bps withdrawal, i've already probably missed a month of APR. So though these tokens promise ""liquidity"", truth is if you are holding the base token you HAVE to hold for an extended period to make the math work (which will still be worse than self delegating). That's fine so long as there are valuable farms to get involved in, but these aren't going to last forever as people dump the worthless governance tokens they get from the farms. Also, I *THINK* these protocols charge a commission on top of what many of their validators already charge, but the fee schedule isn't very clear on that. FINALLY, these protocols seems OKAY with delegating to validators that may be setting up a sybil attack (e.g. **melea**, which is setting up multiple pools to split its stake and avoid seeming larger than it is...not a problem now but could be over time).
* In short, I think the liquid staking protocols are a cool concept, and I'll keep some SOL in marinade for now (earning some money on a lending protocol), but I've already gotten out of SOCN. I know a few high quality validators at this point that I will self delegate to. Will watch out for any new integrations these protocols put out, which could make them more worthwhile.

**DEXs:** I've used both Orca and Raydium. I like both. Raydium has been around longer. Don't really have any big opinions here...most dexs are interchangeable. I think **Defikingdoms on Harmony ONE** is the only cool/fun one I've ever used (which I hope comes to Solana after we get EVM compatibility). Anyways, did some SOL/USDC on Raydium for a bit, as well as RAY/SOL. Decent yields, though it seems Orca tends to be better as its newer. Orca is also much more transparent about their leadership (think they have their own podcast hosted by the founders). Raydium is comparatively secretive. I think trust is important in DeFi, so prefer a protocol where leadership is self-doxed.

**Lending protocols:** I'm familiar with [port.finance](https://port.finance/) and [projectlarix.com](https://projectlarix.com/) . I've used larix, but not port -- though I think they're pretty interchangeable. Don't really have any opinions here...the yield is what it is, if its useful to you that's great. Right now, projectlarix is a good way for marinade to make more sense as the APY from depositing mSOL is quite high (40%), though you'll probably want to dump MNDE frequently since its just a highly inflationary governance token. Same goes for any Larix/PORT you earn.

**Analytics:** I've used [step.finance](https://step.finance/) to track my overall DeFi portfolio. I like it a lot -- would love to see even more functionality and integrations here. Things I'd really love to see is a way to track my historical returns and portfolio size denominated in USD (rather than just current position size and current APY on farms), as well as anything that could help me track cost basis. I'm already dreading tax season this year! Honestly, a protocol that can help with users' tax reporting will be a MASSIVE benefit to the ecosystem. Hopefully the Solana foundation is funding projects like that.

**Star Atlas: TL;DR - cool concept, but high execution risk and worried about lack of gaming experience on the team. Couldn't find anyone that has AAA development experience on linkedin working for this company.** This is a company promising a AAA space MMORPG game. You can buy ATLAS (in game currency) or POLIS (game governance token) now. Also some functionality with NFTs you can buy now of spaceships and other items, and I think there's a mini game that is in the works. To be clear, I'm not involved here and happy to be corrected by evidence to the contrary...but this project raises red flags to me. AAA games are HARD to make. See the saga with Cyberpunk 2077. The Star Atlas CEO is a finance guy with ZERO gaming industry experience (other than playing them...). More importantly, I did some searches on LinkedIn to see if they've hired any actual game developers with AAA experience...couldn't find a single one. OK. I don't understand how you make a AAA game without game developers. Look, this game is a cool idea, and the team has pumped out some cool concept art and seems to be working on coming up with game mechanics ideas. And trust me, having a game like this would be GREAT for the ecosystem - I want it to work. But I'll hold out on getting involved until I see some evidence that they can execute on the core idea and deliver without a 10 year delay. People that just take projects like this on face value are going to get BURNT if they aren't careful.

**What am I most excited for?:** I'm really looking forward to EVM compatibility as I think it'll open up a lot of new use cases and drive SOL adoption. Getting DefiKingdoms would be great. Something like OHM (3,3 ohmies) where I don't have to pay $150 in sushi + staking fees would also be cool to have!

Anyways, happy to edit if I've mischaracterized anything here. Hopefully its helpful to some of the newcomers. What protocols have you used and you like? Which ones don't you like?"
