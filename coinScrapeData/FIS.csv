This disruption also affects cross-chain functionalities, despite ongoing block production.

It‚Äòs important to note that rETH, rMATIC, and rBNB are not impacted by this issue.

Our preliminary investigations into the system logs have not identified any errors. The StaFi Chain, developed on Substrate 2.0, has maintained a largely stable framework until this point. Our development team is fully committed to resolving this issue as swiftly as possible, and we are actively collaborating with Parity, the builder of Substrate and Polkadot, to troubleshoot the issues.

We understand the urgency and potential impact on our users. Transparency and timely updates are our top priorities, and we are dedicated to keeping the community informed as we work towards a resolution.

üìÑ For additional information, please visit [GitHub Issue #2074](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/2074).

# üìå FAQ:

1. **What is StaFi Protocol?**  
StaFi stands for Staking Finance and is the first decentralized protocol that provides a liquid staking solution. It allows users to stake their assets and receive rTokens in return, which can be traded, used in DeFi, or simply held to earn rewards.
2. **How do rTokens work?**  
rTokens (like rETH, rDOT) represent your staked assets in StaFi. When you stake through StaFi, you receive rTokens in return. These rTokens can be traded, used in DeFi, or simply held. The number of rTokens you hold represents your staked assets and the rewards they earn.
3. **What tokens are supported by StaFi?**  
StaFi supports 11 tokens from different blockchains. Some of the popular tokens include ETH, DOT, ATOM, and more. The protocol is continuously expanding to support more assets, ensuring users have a wide range of staking options. [Check out our tokens supported here.](https://app.stafi.io)
4. **Is StaFi secure?**  
Yes, StaFi prioritizes security. The protocol undergoes regular security audits, and its infrastructure is designed to ensure the safety of users' assets. Additionally, StaFi employs various mechanisms to safeguard against vulnerabilities and potential threats. [View our audits here.](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/stafi-bootstrap/tree/master/audits)
5. **What are the benefits of using StaFi over traditional staking?**  
Traditional staking often requires assets to be locked up for extended periods. With StaFi, you get the best of both worlds: you can stake your assets, earn rewards, and still have liquidity through rTokens. This means you can use your staked assets in DeFi or trade them without waiting for long unlock periods.
6. **How does StaFi support multiple blockchains?**  
StaFi is designed to be blockchain agnostic. It uses bridges and integrations to support staking on various blockchains, allowing users to stake a variety of assets from different ecosystems and receive corresponding rTokens. StaFi rTokens are supported on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Cosmos, Arbitrum, Optimism and more!

We sure hope our Northern Hemisphere peeps are welcoming summer with grace, as the crypto market may be giving some a bit of a freeze. ‚ùÜ

It is with great excitement that we partake in last month‚Äôs recap and discussion here at Kraken. (‚ñ†\_‚ñ†¬¨)

June‚Äôs review:

To start off the month we announced an exciting new Kraken Pro app feature which allows for [mobile staking](https://blog.kraken.com/post/14092/kraken-pro-mobile-staking-is-here/)! It is ‚Äã‚Äãeasy as 1-2-3; through the app you can input, stake and earn rewards with many different cryptos. Additionally, we‚Äôre thrilled to announce that [Kraken now supports staking for Polygon (MATIC) holders](https://blog.kraken.com/post/14508/earn-up-to-14-in-yearly-rewards-when-you-stake-your-matic/)!

How does Persistence compare to its competition?,PersistenceOne,vl3zbi,2022-06-26 08:46:38,4,0.84,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersistenceOne/comments/vl3zbi/how_does_persistence_compare_to_its_competition/,AverageRedditLad,Discussion,"New ""liquid staking"" projects are rapidly emerging and getting traction. Thus, pSTAKE is constantly contested to refine, develop, and improve its current liquid staking view. In the past, I've taken a look at the general competition of Persistence, focusing on the big boys such as Lido Finance and Marinade Finance. For this post, I'll focus on the Cosmos' liquid staking protocols:

* Osmosis: their superfluid staking allows LPing into a pool and staking your tokens simultaneously. Not sure if they have planned to have multiple assets supported, but for now, the only supported one is OSMO.
* StaFi: has liquid staking for multiple assets, including ATOM. Although in terms of development, they are ahead of pSTAKE, their solution is very similar to Lido Finance, thus not bringing anything new to the game.
* Quicksilver: as far as I understand, it's not much different from other liquid staking protocols apart from allowing users to stake across the entire validator set. Also, it has the benefit of onboarding Cosmos SDK chains seamlessly with minimal effort.

StaFi's and Quicksilver's token utility is just the usual one - network security, governance, and paying for transactions fees. I'm not suggesting these are not grand visions or protocols, but they lack the innovation on the token utility side. Osmosis is a DEX, and for now, the liquid staking aspect is a nice-to-have bonus that cannot compare 1:1 with the others mentioned in this post.

Compare those mentioned above with Persistence's vision of a Liquid Staking Hub where XPRT is the centerpiece of the puzzle. Today's liquid staking protocols have the utility of their liquid-staked tokens on other 3rd party apps. For example, StaFi uses Uniswap for their rTokens liquidity. They must integrate with Aave, or other protocols, for borrowing and lending, taking value away from the token holders.

Persistence will build use-cases for the stkASSETS on their native chain while bringing utility to the XPRT stakers. For instance, their DEX will have stkXPRT as the leading pair for all stkASSETS, e.g., stkATOM/stkXPRT, stkETH/stkXPRT, and so on. This main difference makes me so bullish on Persistence compared to its competitors. That's why I said that Persistence doesn't REALLY have competition - they're not building a simple liquid staking protocol but a Liquid Staking Hub."
Seeing $FIS on that list shows that users are now appreciating the liquid staking solution that StaFi Protocol offers. ü§åüèΩ,Stafi,vhgmur,2022-06-21 11:59:49,4,0.84,0,https://i.redd.it/v8kvpk6uyz691.png,LessEfficiency8,,

* **Trading via Kraken App and Instant Buy will be available once the liquidity conditions are met** *(when a sufficient number of buyers and sellers have entered the market for their orders to be efficiently matched).*

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the assets:

**Elrond (EGLD)**

Elrond is a scalability focused blockchain network that is building a new internet economy. The network utilizes a blockchain scaling approach called sharding to split the network into smaller pieces in order to address the latency issues that have affected other blockchains as they grow. EGLD is Elrond‚Äôs native token, which allows users to pay for network transaction fees and to earn rewards for helping to secure the network via staking. Check out the Kraken Learn Center guide, [What is Elrond?](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-elrond-egld/) to learn more.

**Harvest Finance (FARM)**

Harvest Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated yield farm. Harvest Finance stakes user tokens en masse, auto-compounding them for improved returns. The FARM token allows holders to vote on the direction of the protocol and can also be used to provide liquidity to the platform.

**Stafi Protocol (FIS)**

Staking Finance or StaFi is one of the first DeFi protocols to unlock the liquidity of staked assets. Users can stake their Proof-of-Stake tokens and receive equivalent amounts of rTokens (reward tokens). Users can trade these rTokens on decentralized exchanges and also use them to earn staking rewards. FIS is the governance token for the StaFi protocol and helps to secure the StaFi ecosystem through staking.

**Ampleforth Governance Token (FORTH)**

Ampleforth is the first rebasing cryptocurrency. AMPL follows the value of the U.S. Dollar by changing the circulating supply of AMPL on a daily basis. FORTH is the governance token of the Ampleforth protocol. FORTH holders can vote on changes to the Ampleforth protocol and influence the direction of the platform.

**Gitcoin (GTC)**

Gitcoin is a community focused blockchain project and quadratic funding solution laying out the future infrastructure of Web3. Gitcoin plans to fund and provide support to Web3 developers building the decentralized internet. GTC is Gitcoin‚Äôs governance token, which lets holders vote in the GitcoinDAO and help plan the future of the platform.

**Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange (LCX)**

Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange is a cryptocurrency trading platform offering advanced trading tools, token sales and security token offerings. LCX also offers a decentralized exchange aggregator that allows users to compare and execute trades across multiple platforms from a single interface. The LCX token can be used to pay for services offered, such as LCX terminal subscriptions, custodial services and exchange transactions.

**MXC (MXC)**

Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol) is building a decentralized global network of devices that enables a more efficient transfer of data around the world. MXProtocol uses the distributed architecture of blockchain to create data-sharing efficiencies across internet of things (IOT) networks. MXC tokens allow users to pay for network transaction fees and earn rewards for helping to secure the network via staking.

**Near Protocol (NEAR)**¬†

NEAR Protocol is a Proof-of-Stake layer-one blockchain with support for smart contracts. Using a technique called sharding to overcome scalability challenges, it aims to provide a user-friendly platform for decentralized apps (dApps). The NEAR cryptocurrency allows users to pay fees for transactions, run applications and pay for storage. Check out the Kraken Learn Center guide, [What is NEAR Protocol?](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-near-protocol) to learn more.

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch ‚Äì not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken‚Äôs listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken‚Äôs blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future.¬†

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee of executing at a certain price for a market order. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."

2022 Road Map? Dev update? Exchange Listings? Yield opportunities for Fis and rProducts?,Stafi,serxza,2022-01-28 09:23:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stafi/comments/serxza/2022_road_map_dev_update_exchange_listings_yield/,_We_The_PeepHole_,,"Let me start by saying that I am a user of this protocol. I like it. It gives me the opportunity to leverage my staked assets and generate yield with them. I am staking DOT, and providing liquidity in the DOT/rDOT pool on BSC. The platform, while not necessarily intuitive or easy to use, serves its purpose. I'm glad I found Stafi.

However, there seem to be a few sticking points, IMO. These are:

1. FIS token lacks liquidity. It is on a very limited number of not only CEXs but DEXs as well. rFIS and other rTokens are even more illiquid, though this is to be expected. Can we expect any exchange listings in the next couple quarters?
2. Cosmos IBC integration. Will it be possible to bridge rATOM to the Cosmos Hub? With the launch of superfluid staking in the future for ATOM, this point could be moot soon. But until then, I would love to have the option to brige my rATOM to a Cosmos-compatible protocol (Sifchain, Osmosis) without paying ethereum network gas fees, or having to convert to another coin entirely. This would have the added benefit of attracting a massive community of defi-capable, engaged market participants from the Cosmos ecosystem, bringing with them fresh capital.'
3. Few liquidity pool programs. This seems to be a relatively easy way to bootstrap liquidity on DEXs and onboard a new generation of users. DOT/rDOT could be integrated with pools on the Acala, Moonbeam, or Bifrost networks to attract even more liquidity.
4. \*\*\*Marketing\*\*\*. I know the Dev team is extremely product backend focused, and the marketing busget refelcts that. In the early stages of a product, especiually one that may eventyually hold 10 figures worth of user funds, this is essential. However, the lack of users (and thus liquidity) detracts from the profitabilityand usability. A massive marketing push- coupled with CEX listings, IDOs and more yield opportunities for eTokens- would be a significant boon for the Stafi platform, token, and community. I really hope the devs continue to provide periodic updates. Peace.

"StaFi - Dig deep, find a Diamond",Stafi,pscxmu,2021-09-21 02:13:44,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stafi/comments/pscxmu/stafi_dig_deep_find_a_diamond/,Walrus1708,,"One of the major decisions crypto projects make is regarding the consensus mechanism. Primarily, projects have chosen PoW (Proof of Work) or PoS (Proof of Stake) in the past. Among these, PoS is becoming increasingly popular and list of projects using PoS is ever growing. PoS uses staking of coins for securing network and more staking is considered better as that reduces possibility of bad actors compromising the network. In some projects like Solana or Cardano, 70-75% coins are staked and the remaining are in circulation. But too few coins in circulation can affect liquidity causing inefficiencies in price discovery. StaFi provides a secured solution to address the conflict between the mainnet security and the token liquidity in the Staking model. *StaFi Protocol is the first DeFi protocol unlocking liquidity of staking assets.*

Users can stake PoS tokens through StaFi and receive rTokens (reward tokens) in return, which are available for trading while still earning staking rewards. For example, if a user stakes 1 XTZ, s/he will obtain rXTZ (reward XTZ) that is equivalent to the original token. rXTZ represents regular yields of tokens and the ownership of XTZ on the original chain. At the same time, rXTZ can be traded on the bonded assets market based on the Stafi protocol. Different to XTZ that is staked and locked on the original chain, tradable rXTZ has no lock period, but still keeps generating returns. As a result, holders of rXTZ no longer need to bear the risk of volatility and make timely judgments on market conditions.

Not only that, StaFi can also enable leveraged liquidity staking. In simpler terms, one can lend reward tokens to borrow native tokens and earn yield on borrowed tokens. They are building a single click facility so that the same can be done more than once thus creating leverage.

Key propositions of StaFi are as follows:

a) For PoS networks to work well, one needs large amounts of coins to be staked. But that is at the expense of liquidity. StaFi solves for both liquidity and security.

(b) Process for staking coins is complex on many chains. StaFi makes it simple.

(c) StaFi enables stakers to choose high performing validators using algorithm so that chances of slashing are low.

(d) On many blockchains / protocols, staked coins have unlock period. StaFi solves for that as well.

StaFi, launched in Sep, 2020, have made decent progress and have been adding new reward tokens continuously. They have already added reward tokens for Ethereum, BNB, Polkadot, Kusama, Atom and Polygon in addition to for native FIS tokens. And, they are planning to launch reward tokens for Solana and BNB soon.

Till date, in about a year, StaFi has

* Unique users: 554
* Total Fee: $214 K
* TVL: $70 M

In order to keep growing, StaFi is partnering with staking platforms, RockX is an example, for making liquid staking available on staking platforms. This will help them add users from allied networks. It has a very active Twitter network (27K followers) where they post regular updates. They also have a 2,000 strong Discord community.

Liam Young and Tore Zhang are the founders of StaFi. They have a small team of 5 engineers working on this protocol. They raised $600 K from Bitmax (Singapore based exchange), Spark Digital Capital (investors in Polygon, Algorand, etc.) and Web3 Foundation. Founders were part of an earlier venture focused on providing staking services and found it extremely hard to explain complexities in staking to an average Joe. So, they decided to make it simple for everyone to stake and stay liquid at the same time.

FIS is the native token of StaFi and is used for paying transaction fees, for staking in order to secure the network and on chain governance. The initial issuance is 100 million FIS and there will be further issuance each year ahead. The inflation rate will vary between 2.5% to 10% depending upon the staking rate (10% for ideal staking rate of 50%).

Fee income earned will be used in the following manner (subject to future governance)

1. 20% paid as Validator rewards
2. 10% deposited to Project treasury, and
3. 70% towards burn and buy

There is some confusion on Circulating supply ‚Äì as per StaFi it is \~27 million (\~ $40 M in capitalization) and as per Coinmarketcap it is \~11 million (\~ $17 M in capitalization). Overall, token economics is inflationary in the beginning but can with high staking and traction turn deflationary. Token economics are still being thought through and is subject to change in future.

Now coming to the key question on how exciting an investment opportunity StaFi is. In cryptoverse, things change very fast and only projects that are structurally derisked stand a better chance of becoming mainstream. Standalone lending-borrowing DEX, for example, built on a Layer 1 blockchain runs the risk of liquidity drying up or moving to competition. But the Layer 1 blockchain itself is comparatively more derisked as it is dependent on not just this DEX but multiple other projects on that. Similarly, StaFi is structurally dependent on not one but multiple projects giving it a longer runway. The value of sum total of staked coins in crypto ecosystem is large and will only keep growing which provides StaFi a huge playground and with leveraged liquidity staking things will only get hugely interesting. The most pressing imperative before the team is to raise some capital, build a stronger team and press hard."

6. APN Utility

There are multi-roles in the Apron Network, such as the Provider (infrastructure service provider), the Miner (node miner), the consumer (DApp/DeFi developers ), the Inspector (supervisor of the infrastructure services), the Delegator, and regular users. $APN takes effective of service settlement and stimulus in the Apron Network. Participants pay $APN to use infrastructure services and obtain $APN by providing resources and construction, thereby forming an ecologically closed loop. The token scenario of each role as follows:

The Provider (infrastructure service provider) provides its capabilities such as Ethereum RPC services, Polkadot RPC services, oracle services, privacy protection services, and the like to obtain $APN rewards attenuation while receiving $APN tokens according to the service provided by developers.

The Miner (node miner) obtains rewards by providing and running nodes.

The Consumer (DApp/DeFi developers) pays the $APN tokens required for the service to the infrastructure service provider.

The Inspector obtains $APN Tokens rewards by supervising the registered services' operation on the network and inspecting the registered services. 

The Delegator provides $APN tokens to the Miners and Providers for the staking and receive the APN tokens and a portion of the service fee.

 Regular users gain profit from using DApp and Defi products.

APN is the native token of Apron Network, maximum of supply is 1 Billion, 60% of this amount is the reward for mining and service providers; Institutional private sale constitutes 15%; Team has 5% of the tokens and Advisor has 3%; Ecosystem construction 17%; these tokens are mainly used for LPO (slot auction), market activities, airdrops etc.
