I fell down a rabbit hole trying to find out what happened to bareMinerals. Here‚Äôs what I found.,MakeupEducation,1i8cpzc,2025-01-23 15:11:27,14,0.89,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupEducation/comments/1i8cpzc/i_fell_down_a_rabbit_hole_trying_to_find_out_what/,Chunglefutts,,"I‚Äôve always loved bareMinerals. One of the very first makeup products I started using regularly as a teen was the powder foundation, and I‚Äôve been a fan ever since. I use Complexion Rescue and it‚Äôs one of the only effective tinted moisturizers with SPF that I can tolerate on my face these days (either texturally or without getting a rash). Suddenly, it‚Äôs completely sold out everywhere. WTF? 

I tried to find a thread on the seeming disappearance of beloved bareminerals products, but couldn‚Äôt really find anything definitive on what the hell is going on. So, I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole‚Ä¶

Well, turns out bareminerals was bought by a private equity firm back in 2021, along with Laura Mercier and Buxom. Not a whole lot has come out about it, but [one article quoted](https://www.glossy.co/beauty/whats-next-for-bareminerals-laura-mercier-and-buxom-post-shiseido/) the then-CEO of Orveon Global, the affiliate that now owns the three brands: 

*As the ‚Äúinventor of clean beauty,‚Äù according to Houdayer, makeup label BareMinerals is doubling down on the branding it started with in 1995.¬†
‚ÄúWe basically want to go back to the initial positioning of the brand and move away from a very non-distinctive clean beauty positioning, because everybody and nobody‚Äôs clean,‚Äù said Houdayer. Orveon plans to do a brand revamp, with a focus on ‚Äúmodernizing, digitalizing and internationalizing‚Äù the brand.*

Around the same time, [a class-action lawsuit was filed against bareminerals](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/beauty-products/bareminerals-class-action-claims-makeup-contains-harmful-manmade-chemicals/) which was part of a [slew of lawsuits alleging use/non-disclosure of PFAS in various consumer products](https://www.resilinc.com/blog/pfas-legislation-and-lawsuits/) alleging that their foundation contained PFAS, though [they were dismissed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/shiseido-again-defeats-suit-over-pfas-in-bareminerals-products) due to the consumers‚Äô inability to show that their products contained PFAS. It seems that was filed against the previous company, Shiseido, as it pertains to products manufactured prior to the acquisition. Perhaps the acquisition occurred as a result of the allegations? Pure speculation, of course.  

There is also [a lawsuit](https://www.law.com/radar/card/california-orange-552959-bonnie-reyes-vs-orveon-global-us-llc/) claiming this: 

*The action, brought by Pacific Trial Attorneys, accuses the defendant of deceptively selling the product in an oversized container and underfilling the product in an effort to save money and deceive consumers.*

I don‚Äôt see an update thus far, and I can‚Äôt read the whole article because I‚Äôm not a subscriber, buuuuuut it‚Äôs also a bit sus that the CEO was[replaced shortly thereafter](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/61ba6737c564597f54aabe04/65af2450ddd0c85d3aafa2f6_Press%20Release%20-%20CEO%20Neela.pdf) in January 2024. 

In lazy and speculative conclusion, the past 4 years have been a wee bit rocky for the company and its rebranding process. Combined with the state of the world with Covid, supply chain issues, inflation, and political havoc, I‚Äôm really not surprised. Hopefully they can get everything sorted and start putting out great products again in the next few years.

Sidenote: I could probably do a better job digging into the lawsuits, but my coffee is getting cold and my cat has a vet appointment. Subscribe to Bloomberg Law to look at the full lawsuits if you‚Äôre inclined, unlike myself!

Unlike most blockchains where transaction costs fluctuate with market volatility, VeChain uses a dual-token system. $VTHO handles transaction fees, while VeChain Token, $VET focuses on market value. This separation makes fees more predictable, which is something enterprises would definitely appreciate. Plus, $VTHO is automatically generated just by holding VET, which I think is a nice passive earning mechanism.

What really caught my attention is how accessible $VTHO has become. It‚Äôs even available on Bitget, which is great for anyone looking to trade it. With its burning mechanisms and dynamic supply model, it feels like VeThor has a solid approach to managing scalability issues without compromising on cost efficiency.

If scalability and cost predictability are what businesses are after, $VTHO might actually be onto something. Have any of you looked into it? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!"
This Is Why I Invest/Hold Trump and Melania,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i7gj6u,2025-01-22 12:26:43,26,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i7gj6u/this_is_why_i_investhold_trump_and_melania/,Chandler005,General,"I See a Lot of New People in Crypto on This Sub ‚Äì Here‚Äôs My Two Cents and Why I Bought These Two Coins

First off, welcome to the world of crypto! Here‚Äôs my advice for those who are new, and my reasoning behind choosing to invest in these two coins.

# Some Basic Ground Rules:

***1. Never invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose.***

***2. This is NOT financial advice.***  ¬†

# Why Meme Coins?

These two coins I‚Äôm discussing are meme coins. Typically, meme coins don‚Äôt have inherent value‚Äîwhat they do have is hype and a strong community.

If you‚Äôre looking for secure investments, these are not for you. Instead, consider traditional stocks, ETFs, or cryptos with solid fundamentals like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano (ADA), or VeChain (VET)... These options may offer lower risk and better stability, but they also come with lower potential returns (e.g., no 2-5x gains).

If you‚Äôre chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, then you‚Äôre in the right place.

My Background:  I started investing in crypto in 2020 during the last bull run. Back then, I avoided meme coins like the plague because everyone warned me against them.

And while it‚Äôs true that they‚Äôre incredibly risky, the biggest winners (and losers) often come from meme coins.

I had the chance to invest in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu before they skyrocketed, but I didn‚Äôt because I listened to the warnings. Now, looking back, I regret missing out on those massive gains.

So this time around, I‚Äôve decided to allocate 10-15% of my crypto portfolio to meme coins‚Äîusing money I can afford to lose.

# Why Trump and Melania Coins?

Here‚Äôs why I chose these two coins over others:

***There‚Äôs a recognizable figure behind them.***

Most meme coins have nothing backing them‚Äîno purpose, no leadership. But these coins are tied to two high-profile individuals: the President of the United States and the First Lady.

***Accountability.***

If this were a rug pull, the people behind the coins (Trump and Melania) would face enormous backlash‚Äînot just from investors but from the media and the public worldwide.

They can‚Äôt afford that level of damage to their reputations, especially from their own supporters.

***Unique opportunity.***

These coins are still very new, which means we‚Äôre super early. Yes, there will be volatility in the coming days and weeks, but that‚Äôs also where opportunities for profit lie.

¬†

**The Potential:**

Let‚Äôs imagine these coins reach the current market caps of some of the biggest meme coins:

Trump Coin at Dogecoin‚Äôs current market cap.

[https://marketcapof.com/en/official-trump/dogecoin/](https://marketcapof.com/en/official-trump/dogecoin/)

Melania Coin at Shib current market cap.

[https://marketcapof.com/en/melania-meme/shiba-inu/](https://marketcapof.com/en/melania-meme/shiba-inu/)

The potential returns here could be huge. Of course, this is a gamble, and I could be completely wrong. But I‚Äôm willing to take the risk.

**Final Thoughts:**

If you‚Äôre considering investing in these coins, remember to:

***Do your own research.***

***Be prepared for fluctuations.***

**Take profits, especially after 2-5x gains.**

What do you think? If you agree with my reasoning, upvote this post. If not, let me know your thoughts in the comments.

Good luck, everyone!"

An unusual problem,Equestrian,1i6e0ef,2025-01-21 03:19:51,9,0.91,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/1i6e0ef/an_unusual_problem/,LunaKPalara,Education & Training,"TL;DR - looking for things to do with my horse on the ground in unfrequent visits until the war/my service ends.

Hey guys. Hope you‚Äôre having a really good day.

I highly doubt anyone here has found themselves in this situation, but I was hoping for some advice either way. My horse and I have a bit of a weird history and a bit weird circumstances. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief.

I got my horse in early 2020 when she had just turned 2. We spent two years building trust from the ground. I taught her the basics of accepting the brush, picking up her feet, leading, backing up, lunging. I started riding her when she was four, but she proved to be a nightmare to fit a saddle to due to her build, and a couple of ‚Äúchain‚Äù health problems also got it in the way, when EMS made her overweight and even harder to fit comfortably and the weight led to some back pain.

It took nearly two years of trial and error to fit her a saddle, get the weight off and get rid of the back pain. So between ages 4-6, I barely rode her. In September of 2023 I had to move her to another yard with a bigger pasture and better food for her EMS, and because I‚Äôm just that lucky - we had an accident on our way there with the trailer that only by miracle she made it out of physically unscathed.

So she was at a new place, having gone through a very traumatic experience (especially as a horse who hated the trailer even before), and things weren‚Äôt great.

Then a devastating war broke out in my country. I had to enlist. She had a couple scares while I was away in training where missiles had hit close to her yard, and I don‚Äôt even know how it may have affected her because I wasn‚Äôt there.

In the past year, I‚Äôve only been able to visit her every few months. She‚Äôs in 24/7 turnout, with plenty friends and a constant food source, and the yard owner gives her some attention and supervises her farrier and vet visits, so I know she‚Äôs okay.

She turned 7 this January. I haven‚Äôt trained her in ages and I‚Äôm worried that, if I make it out alive to be discharged a couple of years from now, I‚Äôll never be able to get her back under saddle. But that‚Äôs the least of my worries now. I‚Äôm mainly worried about how to still keep our connection ‚Äúfresh‚Äù during this time. We used to spend hours and hours together every single day and had very strong trust between us. She would follow me around everywhere, nap against me, we‚Äôd even run around together in the arena and she would mirror me perfectly. Now we‚Äôve gone from that, to what feels like practically strangers. Which is stupid, she‚Äôs a horse, and as long as she‚Äôs healthy and happy I don‚Äôt really care about anything else - but it‚Äôs troubling me, especially when I‚Äôm struggling to stay hopeful during these years until we can go back to spending every day together. I see people with their horses online and I feel like my insides are burning with jealousy. I feel like I‚Äôm missing entire years out of her life that I‚Äôll never get back.

I‚Äôve found a way to perhaps visit her once a month, but in my last few visits I only really brushed her and cleaned out her feet and udders. There‚Äôs no point lunging when I‚Äôm not there frequently and consistently enough to make progress in her training, and riding is worlds away from us.

Basically what I want to do is build a groundwork/in-hand activity plan to make the most out of our limited monthly time together. Something that I can do with her for a few hours once a month to stay ‚Äúfresh‚Äù in her mind and give her some positive experience and memories every visit, so that when I come back full-time in a few years I‚Äôm not an utter stranger. It‚Äôs going to be hard to get her under saddle at 10 years old but I‚Äôm trying not to focus on that for now. My main objective is to make the most out of my visits and keep her ‚Äúhandled.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a bit vague, I know. But I‚Äôd love some advice. Or if somehow you‚Äôve ever been in a similar situation, I‚Äôd love to hear what you did."
How does my portfolio look?,WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i65176,2025-01-20 18:53:42,2,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i65176,Gianleafs,Discussion,Will I be a millionaire
Recovered memory on mushrooms/MDMA.,MSSAbuse,1i5znta,2025-01-20 15:08:50,6,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSSAbuse/comments/1i5znta/recovered_memory_on_mushroomsmdma/,ihopeitreallyhurts,,"TW: child sexual abuse, grooming, incest

TL:DR - I recovered memory of my mother and grandfather molesting me while on a strong dose of psilocybin mushrooms and MDMA.

I (51,M) have recently been grappling with a bunch of COCSA stuff from my distant past, both on my own and in therapy. The pain of it all has been so great that I was living inside a panic attack which I kept hidden for about two months. I started thinking I could have a heart attack at any moment. I needed to figure out how to deal with it or die.

I have a lot of experience with psychedelics (and drugs in general) both for recreational and therapeutic purposes. They‚Äôve helped me in bigger and more material ways than decades of psychotherapy have.

Four days ago, as I was struggling to breathe as I walked down the sidewalk, i decided that I was going to trip and get to the bottom of this when I got home. It was my last day of training at a new job and everyone there was really supportive and kind to me. I saw this as an auspicious sign.

I returned home, put pajamas on, and straightened up my apartment. I put on a long, mid-tempo techno/house DJ mix. I set my intentions to heal my sick, broken heart. I made a tea with 3.5 grams of mushrooms and drank it. In less than 30 minutes I was tripping balls and spirit guides were rushing up to meet me. I told them what was wrong in detail and that I needed help. I told them my heart is sick and I need healing. They said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all good! We‚Äôve got you!‚Äù Thirty minutes later I took 125 mg of MDMA. As I was in a dialogue with one of the mushroom spirit guides, the MDMA came on strong and floored me. I felt physically overwhelmed and I moved from my couch to my bed.

By the time I got to my bed, the intensity of my emotions and my somatic responses was ramping up. I was curled up in a tight ball, silently pleading to the spirits for relief; asking them why things are the way they are, why they were the way they were, and what hope there is for me. A gentle, non-threatening voice plainly stated ‚ÄúYou were sexually abused.‚Äù Deep down, I‚Äôd always known this. I started asking who? The spirit voice didn‚Äôt seem to want to say it.

I asked, ‚ÄúWas it my parents?‚Äù As soon as I asked, something happened inside me. It was mental and physical. I experienced a physical feeling sort of like how I‚Äôd imagine it feels when a dislocated joint pops back into its socket. I gasped and immediately I could feel my mind and my body reconnect themselves. The muscles that had been knotted in my neck and back for over a year just released. A space opened up in my consciousness that had never been there before. In that space I saw a glimpse of the abuse. I sat up and was just like, ‚ÄúHoly shit. Holy shit. Holy shit!‚Äù In the moment, in that psychic space, it was a relief. I knew for the first time that I am not insane. So many things in my childhood that never made sense suddenly snapped into place. 

I called a couple that I‚Äôm close friends with and told them everything I‚Äôd just experienced. They were flabbergasted.

The next day, a bunch more memory came back. There was a bunch of stuff about grooming that my mother and aunt did. And there was a longer, more detailed glimpse into the actual sexual abuse. I was in the bathtub. I was maybe 2 years old. It was my mother and my grandfather in the bathroom with me. They touched my penis with their mouths. It felt good and they were laughing. I also realized my mother exploited my father‚Äôs (Vietnam vet, PTSD, OCD, codependent, narcissist) violent temper and his penchant for bullying me in order to make herself appear to be the good parent while she was much more directly and consistently abusing me. It‚Äôs all disgusting and terrible but it‚Äôs still a relief. I am no longer confused and I am not in a trauma loop. I feel liberated from the chains that were in my mind. Also, I‚Äôve been addicted to porn for my whole life (2-5x/day for as long as free internet porn has existed plus decades of magazines and VHS) but I haven‚Äôt used any porn or masturbated in 4 days. I think I might just be too shocked right now.

I‚Äôve ordered The Body Keeps The Score. I will continue to work with my current therapist though I think I may need to seek out someone with more specialized skills (not easy with no money).

I know that this is probably just the beginning of me untangling the mess that my life has been. I just wanted to put this out there both to help myself and maybe someone else. This is really fucking hard. I wanna confront them but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll just gaslight me and never cop to what they‚Äôve done. "

I knew aspen bedding wasn‚Äôt ideal for snakes due to its lack of humidity holding. A lot of people recommended good substrate which was the push i needed to get proper substrate. I was very anxious to switch since she was already stressed since i had just got her and i was trying to do as much research as possible for the best substrate. I ended up doing coconut fiber mixed in with sphagnum moss which helped the humidity. I also knew about mesh tops not being ideal either so i covered 80% of the top. I did have improper thermostats but bought digital thermostat/hydrometer. The temperature on the basking side stayed 85-90 while the cool side was 72-80. I kept fresh water in a big bowl in the middle and made sure she had two hides. The ones in the photos i once posted had two openings which i heard were stress full so i fixed that issue. It was also too spacious but i had more vines too make it cluttered. Unfortunately everything i did wasn‚Äôt enough to help her. She was already suffering from brain damage. She didn‚Äôt have a respiratory infection or virus (i had her checked out by a vet twice). She also hadn‚Äôt eaten in the 2 months i‚Äôve had her. I did everything for example: crushing the skull of the fuzzie, Heating it up to a warmer temp, changing sizes, feeding in habitat, feeding in separate enclosure, force feeding, assist feeding. Nothing got her to eat. I had ordered that special carnivore powder but unfortunately was too late. I came home to her limp, not moving, squishy. The temp wasn‚Äôt too high it was the normal 85-90 in the basking side. She was probably too weak to move to the cool side. The last vet visit i had was 3 days ago and was told she had no other issues other than build up of fecal matter and urine along with brain damage due to malnutrition. The vet gave her a b12 shot to stimulate appetite but it never worked and she spit out the food i force fed. There was nothing more i could‚Äôve done for her and i‚Äôm devastated by her passing and in tears at the moment. I really tried everything and did immense research on her. I definitely got some tips i needed for the future. I mainly want to post this to bring awareness to owning juvenile BPs that were acquired from chain pet stores. When i first got her i noticed she was smaller than normal juveniles. I used to work at this exact chain, and never got one so small. The employee told me she hasn‚Äôt eaten since she arrived which was a red flag so i adopted her and wanted to give her a chance. I did notice she would bob her head and move with it tilted. That part is my fault because i was uneducated on brain damage in snakes. I rarely handled her because she always seemed stressed (hiding, not exploring, not eating). The vet ended up telling me she most likely was sick from the start and slowly was fading away. Please if you notice any abnormal behavior in a baby take it to the vet immediately and if funds are limited rehome to someone more experienced and who can bring it to a professional. I‚Äôm not going to entirely blame the pet store as it is hard to notice illnesses in babies when multiple people care for them and most snakes from pet stores mange to make it, but it is unfortunate i ended up with a ill one. I really wish i could‚Äôve saved her, even if i had all the proper equipment from the start she was losing weight rapidly and the brain damage became more significant. I understand that some of you might deem me as responsible for her death but please understand i tried everything and did my research. I‚Äôve owned snakes before just not a baby or a ball python. I‚Äôve had corn snakes and an adult california king and neither had any issues so i was uneducated on the signs of sickness and severe neurological issues. Please be careful and never ignore signs and do immense research prior to owning any animal especially juveniles. Thank you to everyone who gave wonderful tips. "
Offered a Leadership Role After a Mixed Performance Review‚ÄîBut No Raise. What Should I Do? ,Advice,1i46pkj,2025-01-18 07:39:49,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i46pkj/offered_a_leadership_role_after_a_mixed/,Sixstringjedi9,,"
I recently had my annual performance review at my job in a veterinary clinic, and the feedback was mixed. On the positive side, my boss noted that I‚Äôve formed strong relationships with my coworkers and clients, and I‚Äôm very much a part of the team. They said I‚Äôm professional, courteous, and punctual (I‚Äôve even won awards for being on time), and they appreciated that I‚Äôm kind to clients and their pets and maintain a good rapport with management and team members.

However, the review also pointed out some significant areas for improvement. They said I lack initiative and don‚Äôt always use slow periods productively. For example, I‚Äôve been told to leave the pharmacy to help out in treatment or restock, but I‚Äôve struggled to follow through consistently. There were concerns about my confidence when interacting with clients and restraining animals, which led some coworkers to feel unsafe in certain situations. I‚Äôve also been inconsistent in remembering training and completing tasks like medical notes, which has led to small but frequent mistakes. As a result of these issues, they decided to pull me from my vet tech role and focus on pharmacy-only work, with a reduction in hours.

To add more context, I was in a car accident a few months ago and have been dealing with post-concussion syndrome. I‚Äôve noticed brain fog affecting my memory and focus, and while my boss specifically said that the accident didn‚Äôt influence my performance review, I‚Äôm suspicious of that statement. The timing and chain of events following the review.

The day after this review, my bosses offered me a leadership role as Pharmacy Champion, where I‚Äôd oversee pharmacy operations and take on more responsibility. I‚Äôd focus on improving workflows, converting clients to our online pharmacy, and leading in that area. When I asked if this promotion would come with a raise, they said no due to my performance review. My company only does annual reviews, so I likely won‚Äôt have another opportunity to discuss a raise until next year.

Adding to the situation, I‚Äôve also been interviewing for a potential new job. I passed the preliminary interview and am now preparing for an extensive interview where I‚Äôll meet the team and observe how their pharmacy works. I‚Äôm optimistic about getting a job offer, but nothing is guaranteed yet.

I‚Äôm struggling to make sense of this situation. My current job criticized my performance and pulled me from a previous role, yet they‚Äôre trusting me with a leadership position. I feel like taking on more responsibility without a raise is unfair, especially given their feedback. The annual review policy also means I‚Äôd have to wait an entire year to revisit compensation, even if I excel in this role. On the other hand, I‚Äôm hopeful about the opportunity with the new job, which could pay more, but it‚Äôs still up in the air.

Should I take the leadership role and try to prove myself over the next year, or should I focus on securing the new job and moving on? I see potential for growth in the Pharmacy Champion role, but I‚Äôm concerned about being undervalued. Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated!

Estou a pensar investir mais em criptomoedas e queria ouvir as vossas opini√µes. Atualmente, acredito bastante nos projetos da VeChain (VET) e da Hedera (HBAR), apesar de ainda n√£o ter uma quantidade muito grande investida. Ambos parecem ter um bom potencial a longo prazo, mas sei que o mercado de criptos √© imprevis√≠vel.

Al√©m disso, tenho um pensamento mais focado no longo prazo, inspirado em hist√≥rias como a da Solana, que h√° uns anos valia apenas c√™ntimos e chegou a ultrapassar os 200‚Ç¨. Estou √† procura de criptomoedas que estejam no in√≠cio do ciclo de valoriza√ß√£o ou que tenham um projeto s√≥lido, mas ainda subvalorizado.

O que me recomendariam? H√° alguma cripto que voc√™s acham que tem potencial de crescimento significativo nos pr√≥ximos anos?

It was past two in the morning when JTS1 landed on the tarmac of Bozeman Airport with a slight jolt. The aircraft taxied to its private hangar, where the ground crew waited to take over.

The hangar doors were open, and the crew, in JTS jumpsuits, stood at attention. A jacked-up white 4X4, one of Pastor Tony‚Äôs Boys fleet, sat askance, light flurries of snow drifting through its headlights.

The door to Taylor‚Äôs office opened, and Tim rose to his feet.

‚ÄúI hope you had a nice flight, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Tim. I was able to do some work and get a couple hours of sleep in. I have a meeting with that truck out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see to it, sir,‚Äù said Tim.

Taylor went back into his office.

‚ÄúHope you get some sleep before the sun‚Äôs up,‚Äù said a woman‚Äôs voice. He turned to see the pilot, Lindsey, standing at the curtain that separated the galley from the passenger cabin.

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm lucky,‚Äù he responded.

Holding the curtain in one hand, she said, ‚ÄúYou can always crash at my place. I got the room. You should see what I‚Äôve done with the basement.‚Äù She bit her bottom lip and caressed the top button on her uniform.

He blushed. ‚ÄúDuty. I need to get Taylor back to the ranch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, a twinkle in her eye, ‚Äúthe offer stands. Good night, Tim.‚Äù

He watched her shapely figure descend the stairs. A year ago, Lindsay had purchased the Kleimer Building on Bozeman‚Äôs Main Street and began renovating it into her private residence. Her move did not go unnoticed by the local newspaper:

_JTS Employee Buys Historic Building._

A half-hearted protest ensued for an afternoon with wealthy, rather pasty hippies brandishing signs about preserving Montana‚Äôs history for everyone. Taylor had dispatched Tim and a few lads, just to piss off the snowflakes in the mayor‚Äôs office. By evening, everyone was drinking red wine up the street at the jazz club.

He pulled on his jacket and climbed down to ground level. The crew stood in formation. The frigid wind nipped at their faces.

He stopped at an older man with a mustache that curled at the ends. ‚ÄúSorry to get you boys out of bed so early,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWelcome back, Mr. Boothe. It‚Äôs no problem at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúBen, how long have we known each other?‚Äù

The man investigated the night as he counted. ‚ÄúMaybe five years, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúCall me Tim.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir, Mr. Tim.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. Taylor has a meeting. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs done. Can you get the Air Quad warmed up and set a flight plan for the ranch?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù Ben barked orders to his crew as Tim signaled the imposing truck.

At the bottom of the boarding stairs, he ran his portable metal detector over the two clergymen. When they remained silent, he frisked them. They wore black robes, full beards, and their heads shaved clean. Bizarre crosses of shiny circuit boards hung from their necks. Their muscles bulged full and hard from the steroids and human growth hormones. They were unarmed. He let them climb into the jet where the senator waited.

A lawyer, a man in his late sixties with glasses and perfectly quaffed silver hair, wore an expensive suit. ‚ÄúI have a shoulder holster,‚Äù he said, and lifted his arms.

Tim removed the snub Derringer from beneath his left arm and slipped it into his pocket. He then searched him thoroughly, starting at his ankles and moving to his calves, crotch, back, and arms.

‚ÄúGo on up,‚Äù he said.

During his wait, he sat on the sofa and inspected the weapon. It was short and stout with a black grip and smoke-chrome barrel. A cylinder held three .45 caliber rounds, a compact and powerful tool for persuasion or dissuasion, depending on the line of work. Should a lawyer carry a gun? Truth was, lots of people carried guns these days, moms going to yoga, grandmothers at grocery stores. America had never been so locked and loaded and ready for a fight.

When the meeting concluded, he and Taylor sat in the Air Quad as it hovered ten feet off the tarmac. He glanced down to see Ben and his crew hauling cleaning equipment up the aluminum stairs into the jet‚Äôs cabin.

‚ÄúGrid sync successful. Prepare for altitude,‚Äù announced the computer.

The craft ascended swiftly, and the JTS hangar fell away. The entire airport shrank to the size of a model with toy airplanes, helicopters, and ground traffic going about its purposeful business.

Beyond the airport were the sprawling suburbs of the greater Bozeman area, the veins of intertwining roads outlined by streetlights, and the main artery of Interstate 90 crawling with ant-sized headlights. From this height, neighborhoods took on a logical pattern of grids, including the floral designs of roundabouts and cul-de-sacs. In the distance, the university town of Bozeman proper was lit up like a raucous frat party.

Then the world around them grew misty, the glass shell covered by moisture, and the ground blurred before it vanished as they lifted through the cloud ceiling. There were a few moments of darkness and then a field of glittering stars. He scanned for the Dippers; Eric had taught him once when they‚Äôd gone fishing on public lands and slept out in the summer to fish again in the morning.

Low in the west, the silver shell of a waxing gibbous moon reflected off the surface of the clouds as off an ocean. A meteorite streaked overhead, flashing the clouds with a bright green glow before disappearing.

Taylor reclined in his chair, eyes shut, possibly sleeping.

‚ÄúTen thousand feet altitude achieved. Commencing travel,‚Äù said the computer. ‚ÄúETA in sixteen minutes.‚Äù

He felt the inertia push him back into his seat as they canted south of Sacajawea Peak. The mountain, cutting through the clouds was crusted in white, reflecting the moon like an ivory breast.

Far in the distance, the red and white flash of another Air Quad blinked in and out. According to the radar, it was stationary. Stargazers smoking a bowl, most likely a date night. If you had money‚Äîand many people in Bozeman did‚ÄîAir Quads made for a good time on a night like this.

He glanced at Taylor. Eyes still closed.

He was having trouble shaking the surreal experience on the bridge. The way his boss had taken the gun and, without hesitation, ended that old woman‚Äôs existence. How those lights had faded. What wondrous lights! The bridge had shaken, vibrating through his legs. The masked motorcycle gang tearing by. That boy, running for his life. The thing, the shadow creature, jumping on him, ending him.

It shouldn‚Äôt surprise him that his boss was a killer. Hell, he _knew_ he was a killer. JTS killed. They employed people around the world who engaged in all manner of combat. Tim himself had studied the craft of killing and had trained others to kill. Like Taylor, he was a mercenary. They were in the business of death. Killing was the daily bread.

He should forget these things.

It was snowing heavily in the mountains when they landed softly on the Air Quad pad. A small crew of two men and a woman received them.

As was his custom when exhausted, the senator went to his personal elevator without a word of goodnight and vanished into the depths of his mansion.

Tim thanked the crew and took the service lift to the subterranean garage, climbed into one of the SnowTracks, and drove himself without the aid of navigation up the mountain to his cabin, leaving the machine out front to be buried in snow.

At the door, he tore his clothes off and went to his kitchen in the dark to pour a whisky. The spirit burned his throat. He poured another. Then, in the darkness, he took himself to bed and slept. His slumber consisted of a nightmare on the bridge, which he could not shake in the morning when he roused himself. Like the perfume of a skunk, the crime clung to him.

The snow had stopped. The sky was clear and predawn violet, except for high wisps of cirrus clouds.

He did not work for the rest of the week. Before coffee, he skied five miles along the ridge, stopping to watched the sun rise and turn the powder to diamonds. He saw the fresh tracks of the lone grizzly that hunted there in the summer. He knew it to be a large male that preferred not to be seen. A bald eagle soared the updraft of the canyon, flew over him, and piped softly down.

He climbed until he reached the peak, then veered left and dropped down the steep slope, hitting the moguls of rock and bush. The explosions of his impact blasted up glittering powder that he breathed into his lungs like cold smoke. The drops turned into slopes, and then he was in the tree line of the alpine forest on a trail that Taylor‚Äôs guests liked to use because it was easy and beautiful.

He emerged from the forest into the compound of the ranch, where the massive multi-tiered mansion was connected by a glass skywalk to the steaming, sulfuric hot tubs and swimming pools. Beyond these, there was a small village of private residences, among which the highest and most secluded one was his‚Ä¶ _home_ for the last seven years.

It was a two-level, ultra-modern design with large picture windows on the south side that gave out onto the mountain range and captured both sunset and sunrise. It contained a living room with a television that monopolized an entire wall and a sofa where he often fell asleep watching old movies from his boyhood; a fully stocked kitchen with restaurant-quality equipment where he‚Äôd been practicing sushi techniques with an AI sensei; a gym with all the necessities; and the ranch‚Äôs signature walk-in steam shower (also with a window-wall), which was where he stood, absorbing the heat, sweating, and watching the sea-blue sky above the dove-white snow.

The nightmare had been of the boys playing with a fiery football on the shores of a strange land, safe in the proximity of family, music, and a wedding. Even those who had fled the ravages of war and the destruction of the environment harbored the desire to build unions, bring bloodlines together, and make babies. It was a messy dream. As dreams do, one of the boys had been him, and the other was Eric. They were running from monsters when the ground turned to mud and their legs to sap.

‚ÄúGod, Eric, I miss you, man,‚Äù he spoke into the steam.

Eric, his cousin, used to call him Tadpole. He had practically raised Tim in that government unit on the mean streets of Billings‚Äôs Southside, where Asiatown dappled its overflow ghettos into the hood.

Eric had kept him out of the gangs, out of the militias, kept him in school, kept him fed when his mom ran off, kept him off drugs, off Escape. He taught him how to wrestle, how to fight, how to hunt and fish and skin a deer, how to butcher and freeze the meat so there‚Äôd be food all year. And how to be good to girls.

‚ÄúChivalry is dead, old chap,‚Äù he‚Äôd say in some fake accent, throwing him the book he‚Äôd just finished, saying, ‚ÄúRead that, Tadpole.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it about?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout a man in a war. Gets laid a lot. It‚Äôs about the good guys.‚Äù

Eric, who let him watch the scariest of movies because they were just stories, let him watch porn, hid him in the closet the night he brought Kaylee Kobylinski home from prom so he could see the way a guy ought to fuck a girl. He turned her into a moaning, sobbing mess, and by the time they were done, she was begging him not to join the army, to stay and marry her, and she would always be his.

Eric, who was there when they found his mom‚Äôs body, told him it was okay to cry. But he didn‚Äôt cry. Not for her. Not that night, nor any since.

Eric, who beat the old man when he returned drunk and broke, wanting to take it out on Tim. He beat him so severely that he needed to be carried off in an ambulance. Beat him so bad he never came back.

Eric, who took him to the airport when he deployed. ‚ÄúAll my paychecks are going right into the account. That‚Äôs for you, Tadpole. Be careful with your money, be good, don‚Äôt let anyone fuck with you. You better take States. I know you got it in ya. I‚Äôll be watching.‚Äù

Tim hugged him. Buried his face and felt his eyes burning to the smell of Old Spice. Then he stepped back, and they‚Äôd saluted, and he didn‚Äôt cry.

A paycheck came, then another, then a letter from Eric.

_Hey Tadpole,_

_Gets fucking cold here in the winter. Not as cold as Montana. Different kind of cold. Been in this city for a month now, fighting over the same street for weeks. Don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs who. FEEN dresses just like the locals. Been keeping warm. Met a girl. Her dad‚Äôs a baker, so I get fresh bread now and then. ;) Hope you‚Äôre keeping out of trouble. Keep your grades up. Championship is soon. I‚Äôll be watching. I expect to see you there. I expect to see you win. Well, I better go. Love ya._

Then another paycheck. When the paychecks came, he saved all the money except for a few dollars he‚Äôd use to get a pizza and Coke and watch one of Eric‚Äôs old movies.

Then another letter came, a formal one printed on heavy paper.

_Dear Timothy Boothe:_

_With my deepest regrets and sadness, it is my duty to report that Private First Class Eric C. Boothe was killed in action defending freedom and America on the Eastern Front. As his commanding officer, I would like to send my condolences. Boothe was a great soldier and saved many lives. He fought bravely and valiantly and was a model to his brothers in arms. Sadly, he gave his all when a sniper of the Federation of Eastern European Nations‚Ä¶_

Time passed, and he forgot Eric‚Äôs face; even in the dream, it was obscured. It was the face of every boy, a palimpsest of guys he‚Äôd known throughout his life, but his soul was there. It was Eric who the monster fell on, and the beast was that FEEN sniper lying in wait.

Tim Boothe was a bodyguard‚Äîhe‚Äôd been one since John Taylor had recruited him in his last month of high school.

He had just defeated the best grappler in Montana and had taken the state title, for what it was worth. It was the last achievement of a young athletic career that would not blossom into a college scholarship‚Äîmost universities had stopped doing athletics before he was born. Too many politics and lawsuits. He wasn‚Äôt university material anyway.

It was his junior year of high school. He was sixteen and dropping out. At the end of the school year, he was set to fly to basic training with the romantic dream of getting into the special force. But he probably would have ended up going to the front and fighting FEEN like Eric and so many other kids in his socio-economic position. With unemployment and prices skyrocketing, the military represented a job and stability.

Everything changed after that last match. He was in the locker room, about ready to strip, his kit hanging off his hips, when the door banged open, and three men in suits barged in, checking all the corners to ensure the room was clear. Then in walked John Taylor, military haircut and perfect posture. Tim remembered him as huge and powerful. He wore black slacks and a black t-shirt that displayed his cut physique. He knew he was _somebody_ back then, but he didn‚Äôt know or care exactly who.

The tall man came right up to him and picked up the championship trophy that sat unceremoniously on the bench.

‚ÄúYou destroyed that guy,‚Äù Taylor said. Like the man, the voice was imbued with authority and position.

Tim shrugged.

‚ÄúHe was bigger than you. I know for a fact he‚Äôs all juiced up. I had a little word with his coach.‚Äù

The high school athletic association had stopped testing for steroids two years prior because of funding issues. A lot of kids were pinning and spinning the Escape to get the physical advantage‚Äîinsanity would come later.

‚ÄúBy all rights, he should have had you, but you finished him, clean and simple. That‚Äôs what caught my eye. You move like a dancer.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt much matter. Wrestling‚Äôs out next year. I just want to go home and watch TV.‚Äù Tim eyed the three men suspiciously. In their dark AR glasses, they watched without watching, saw without seeing.

Taylor set down the trophy. ‚ÄúWhat are your plans after high school? College?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, basic training.‚Äù

‚ÄúArmy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNavy, I want to be a SEAL.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom what I saw tonight, you‚Äôre going to make it. You want to go see Eastern Europe, huh? Your cousin died over there, right?‚Äù

He felt his eyes sting. He knew? Why did he care? Tim shrugged again. Nobody wanted to go there, but that was where they ended up.

The man reached out and felt his bicep, ran his thumb across the dent of his chest, and nodded.

‚ÄúLet me make a proposal. It would be a real shame to put this body of yours through that hamburger factory. I need good men. Come work for me. I‚Äôll make sure you can buy a house by the time you‚Äôre twenty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat work?‚Äù He suddenly felt the draft of the room against his exposed skin. He wondered if the bodyguards were filming him. He lifted his kit above his trenches.

‚ÄúYou know John Taylor Security?‚Äù

‚ÄúJTS? Sure. Who doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

The men in black with high-tech gear and machine guns who guarded everything from ATM machines to McDonald‚Äôs parking lots.

The man grinned wide. ‚ÄúI created JTS. Go to this address at noon tomorrow.‚Äù He held out a card. ‚ÄúNot all my guys guard coffee shops. I have an elite unit. There‚Äôs money. No drugs, but pussy when you want it‚Äîor cock. I can get you whatever you like. No questions. You‚Äôll have better training and better funding than you‚Äôll ever get in the military. That is, if you can make the cut. You think you got it in you?‚Äù

The man locked his eyes without blinking. Tim felt his chest grow tight. He was a virgin. He‚Äôd never gone to the comfort rooms of the BAT like the other boys.

John Taylor didn‚Äôt wait for the answer. He did an about-face and walked out of the room. The men in suits waited for a moment before following him.

Tim was alone, holding the card.

The senator had been a powerful man before Tim went to the address on that card, but he had seen him rise to the very top, and with that tide, he himself had risen in the world of JTS. Not only had he purchased that little place on Flathead Lake, which was well-known and vetted by the JTS intelligence apparatus, but he‚Äôd used what he learned in the security industry and built an anonymous safety net off the books: a sailboat docked in the Gulf of Mexico, a floor in a New York high-rise, a majority share in a small but growing chain of milk tea shops in various Asiatowns around the world. The money was all funneled into crypto held in an alias account that was administered by a dark web agent that was only accessible at the utterance of a password‚Äîa password only one other person on the face of the planet knew.

He stepped into the hot spray of the shower, soaped, rinsed, and then walked into his living room to dry in the greenhouse effect of the sun blasting through the windows.

‚ÄúComputer, call Z-dawg.‚Äù

‚ÄúZ-dawg is online. Calling,‚Äù said the AI.

Z-dawg was short for Zombie Dawg. Z because, like a zombie, he felt no pain or fear. Dawg because he was dogged and didn‚Äôt stop until the job was done.

‚ÄúHey, boss, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Z-dawg‚Äôs face filled the screen. ‚Äú_And_ you‚Äôre naked.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and Scarlet want to hang tonight, drink something strong?‚Äù It was a code for _we need to talk now, off the JTS logs._

‚ÄúSure, sounds good. I could use a drink. Should I dress up?‚Äù _Will I need a gun?_

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm buying. How about 9 PM at the lounge?‚Äù _No gun. But there are things you need to know._

‚ÄúBe there or be nowhere.‚Äù _If I don‚Äôt make it, it means I‚Äôm dead._"

Let's Burn Some Thor,Vechain,1i1dzdv,2025-01-14 14:18:26,73,0.97,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/1i1dzdv/lets_burn_some_thor/,kyledotvet,Discussion,"**TL;DR:** I've launched¬†[Thorhead](https://thorhead.com/). The first NFT project on VeChain minted solely using Thor. The mint price will always only be **100 VTHO**. The goal is to provide education about VeChain in a simple, accessible way, all while burning plenty of Thor.

* [Twitter](https://x.com/Thorheads)

# The Idea

I've written about why I think VeChain is a great project and solid platform in detail in the past (see [here](https://kyle.vet/blog/key-vechain-differentiators)). But the reality is, most people don't have a place to even begin understanding what sets VeChain apart.

I believe that if we as a community can¬†**educate**¬†those outside of crypto by providing a¬†**clear**,¬†**accessible**¬†mental model on which to build future VeChain understanding, then we will be able to¬†**thrive**¬†in the face of any future financial or regulatory adversity.

# The Vision

The vision for Thorhead is simple: Create NFTs that are as¬†**accessible**¬†as possible, emphasize VeChain platform¬†**education**, and broaden the¬†**gateway**¬†into other VeChain projects.

However, if you've spoken with anyone¬†*not*¬†actively involved in crypto, you know that the barrier to entry is high. For starters, there is the massively negative stigma associated with NFTs. They are seen as ""dumb images"" with ""no intrinsic value"" (i.e. ""You mean those stupid monkey pictures?""). And they're not wrong. The NFT space is littered with thinly-veiled ponzi schemes and projects that are just plain bad. On top of that, blockchain in general gets a bad rap for being affiliated with scams and fraud (three letters: F T X).

So, how do we fight and win the uphill battle that others have lost?

By making something that is¬†**accessible**¬†and¬†**educational**, without taking itself too seriously. Thorhead is¬†*definitely*¬†not beating the ""dumb image"" allegations. In fact, its leaning into it. We're not trying to be the next Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks. We're trying to be the first NFT that your technology-indifferent grandpa mints. This is some of the reasoning behind why the mint price is so low at only 100 VeThor. Without the burden of financial investment, that any mint can be a fun, educational experience.

# The Launch

Thorhead officially launched on Jan 4. As far as I know, this is the first and only NFT project on VeChain minting using exclusively VeThor.

The reception has been nothing short of incredible. Over 1,500 Thorhead NFTs have been minted and thousands of VeThor have been burned in the process. There is no limit to the number of Thorheads that can be minted, and the project will continue to mint Thorheads as long as there is VeThor to burn.

But this is just the beginning.

Thorhead are now indexed on [VeChainStats](https://vechainstats.com/nft/thorheads/1/) as well as being listed on [World of V](https://worldofv.art/collection/Thorhead) so I'm excited to see what the open market does with it.

# The Future

With the goal of **accessiblity** and **education** in mind, future project expansions and collaborations seem inevitable. The ability to upgrade your Thorhead by burning other Thorheads, sponsoring all transactions for those that have collected a certain number of Thorheads, and integrations with VeBetterDAO to increase accessibility are all up for consideration based on community sentiment and feedback.

Accompanying these expansions will be a continued focus on education. The goal is to provide a clear, accessible mental model for understanding VeChain and blockchain technology. This will be done through a series of blog posts, videos, and other educational content that will be released in the near future.

If you've made it this far, I hope you'll join me on this journey. Check out the [dApp](https://thorhead.com/), mint your first Thorhead, and let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Thanks!"

# Case #000: Qubetics

[Qubetics](https://www.qubetics.com/) ($TICS) | The World's First Layer1, Web3 Aggregated Ecosystem that United Leading Blockchains Including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana & More.

\-------------------------------------------NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE-------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

**Qubetics, is it legit? Is it a scam?** Well, nobody can know until the project launches, but here's the most compelling case I could make for either scenario. See a detailed look into my investigation below.

**'Evidence' it's not a scam:**

Team is engaged, community believes in the project, increased transparency recently, public facing executive team, robust and thought out website, whitepaper does not *appear* AI-generated and provides insight into the project and its fundamentals in a way that's fairly easy to understand, while also providing enough technical detail that seems to have merit, executive team has reputation outside the crypto space that could be impacted, no history of past project rugs or failures that I could find, if the company sticks to the plan, the phased release *could* reduce the odds of the project dying on arrival, the team has some fairly innovative ideas if they're able to execute technologically, team appears to believe in the medium-long term vision of the project. A number of established partnerships. The appearance of a mobile application ""Coming Soon"", executive team has a very interesting combination of skills that could make the project really take off, technical team has a great background for the project, team responds professionally and are active in their communities.

**'Evidence' it is a scam:**

Heavy-handed marketing with somewhat sensationalist tactics, marketing material has very limited tone across multiple different sites making it obvious they're all using the same sponsored press releases, marketing material emphasizes what could be looked at as a misleading ROI to draw attention, some pages of the website (like 'Blog') are empty, no transparency on the plans for the liquidity pool and how it will be managed, no firm dates (e.g. no firm launch date, largely rough estimates based on quarter), what could be seen as lofty aspirations for a new project, most of the executive team come from the same company (Astell / Antier) (see [Business Filing](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09991820)) which *could* contribute to either group think or a willingness to collude on a scam, this relationship could also help them fabricate or overstate thier role at the company if their intentions are malicious, very few technical demonstrations or proofs of concept for many of their suggested features that would differentiate the product *so far* (see 'Evidence it's not a scam'), many promises as far as execution of the project exist on paper but actual rollout and investor-specific information is difficult to come by.

**My Verdict:** Toss-up favoring NOT a scam

\-------------------------------------------NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE-------------------------------------------

# Background

Qubetics came onto my radar after being highly promoted in the new coin / presale / ICO space. The project at the time of this writing is in the 17^(th) phase of its presale with a reported 9.5M raised amongst 14,436 holders (avg. $658 USD per investor).

They currently have about 5.25K followers on X, 3.6K members in their Telegram, and 800 members on their Discord. Assuming the vast majority of those interacting with these spaces are holders, that represents a 36%, 24%, and 5% engagement rate among holders on each platform respectively.

The coin‚Äôs expected formal launch is expected between April and June 2025. The current presale price is $.05 USD/TICS payable via ETH, BNB, SOL, BTC, and seemingly all other major chain currency. This fairly robust multi-chain portfolio of offerings is not typical of most presales and could speak to the merits of the platform itself.

Qubetics Labs LLC is a registered company out of Belize.

A few notes things of note -

* 36 and 24% represent significant engagement among the community assuming there aren‚Äôt bots in use
* Over-promotion and a large amount of sponsored content, not much independent research / review available
* Sponsored content all contains the same information / writing style
* Website is very robust, actively changing, and payment process speaks to interoperability claims

# The Investigation

The Mission:

As found on their website:

‚Äú*Qubetics aims to become the world's first Layer 1, Web3 aggregated ecosystem, uniting major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more. Our vision involves creating a versatile blockchain platform that simplifies and enhances digital interactions across diverse sectors. We plan to develop a non-custodial, open-source wallet integrated with debit and virtual cards, cross-chain DeFi exchanges, and a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to provide enhanced privacy and true decentralization. Our commitment is to provide a seamless experience that facilitates secure transactions and effective management of both crypto and fiat currencies, paving the way for innovative blockchain utilization and expanded digital economy engagement.*‚Äù

Translation for normal people:

*‚ÄúQubetics aims to create a digital platform that brings together popular blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The goal is to simplify how people interact with blockchain technologies in their everyday lives. They plan to offer a user-friendly wallet (where you control your own assets) that works with debit and virtual cards, supports trading between blockchains, and includes a secure, decentralized VPN for better privacy. The focus is on making it easy and safe to manage both cryptocurrencies and regular money, helping more people and businesses take advantage of blockchain's potential.*‚Äù

The CEO:

**Shaffy Yaqubi** | CEO | Yaqubi comes from an interesting background for someone to be the CEO of this type of a company. He appears to come from a largely biomedical sciences background, but can be seen making statements on cryptocurrency as early as 2023. From what I could find, it‚Äôs difficult to vet most of the information on Yaqubi. On one hand, some quick looking shows a history of ethics and advocating for ethical conduct in the medical field. However, a deeper look shows that a lot of that content even in his medical background used many of the publications used to promote Qubetics, to promote himself.

Take, for example, this article: ‚Äò[Cosmetic Enhancements Should be Safe and Smart: Shaffy Yaqubi](https://techpoint.africa/2024/06/01/shaffy-yaqubi-talks-about-the-rise-in-popularity-of-medical-cosmetics/)‚Äô. On the surface, it appears to be ringing endorsement of someone out to affect change for the better in their craft. However, a deeper look indicates the author is ‚Äúa trader, crypto enthusiast, and analyst with over four years of experience in the industry. He strongly believes that crypto assets and the blockchain will continue to gain prominence‚Ä¶ he focuses on news, articles with deep analysis of blockchain projects, and technical analysis of crypto trading pairs.‚Äù This makes it really difficult to continue to trust the quality of the reporting ‚Äì why would a crypto enthusiast be reporting on this? Is Yaqubi a good guy? Maybe, but the effort in promoting it is suspicious. I also find it strange that most mentions publicly of the company's CEO appear to be limited to the past 2 years, roughly the amount of time since the project's conceptualization.

The Team:

**Matthew Collins** | COO | Collins seems to be the real deal. Qubetics looks like it‚Äôs his side project, but he appears to have a pretty strong history in the crypto space especially recently. He‚Äôs got a ton of experience working with clients and has some big names under his belt. Information on him is difficult to find with a somewhat common name, but his background checks out and seems like a great fit for the position.

**Winn Faria** | CTO | Faria also comes from a somewhat interesting background ‚Äì Faria has a long portion of his career in the FinTech space working a lot with financial institutions and consultancies over the course of his career. He eventually founded his own company and went on to likely work with Collins. They appear to have crossed paths before embarking on launching Qubetics.

**Karan Chopra** | Project Manager | Chopra has a much more standard background from what I‚Äôd expect from a Technical Project Manager / Developer. He‚Äôs got a fairly strong blockchain dev background and it also appears that Karan likely crossed paths with both Faria and Collins in recent years.

*//Comments: Based on what I‚Äôve managed to find, this team has a really interesting background for a project like this. Yaqubi seems like he‚Äôs likely managing or advising on at least some of the marketing. In their content, he is very charismatic and seems a good fit for the role ‚Äì if a little inexperienced as far as his crypto resume is concerned. The team behind him has a strong background in financial asset management and client relationships which I think serves them well. A potential weakness I see, is a lack of outside, knowledgeable voices. Their team seems capable on both the technological side and business sides, but with them all mostly coming from the same company, it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôve formed an echo chamber that could damage their project or vision.*

The Community:

With Qubetics in its TestNet phase, the community is obviously very keen on information. Being totally honest, Qubetics has one of the better communities (on Telegram) that I‚Äôve seen. There‚Äôs no degenerate screaming at the mods, Yaqubi is an active member of the chat who provides updates, they‚Äôve stepped things up as far as transparency in recent weeks, but that's to be expected with their project expected to launch soon. They're offering a livestream demonstration of some of their TestNet activities, etc. That‚Äôs more than I can say for many coin launches. The community itself seems excited for the project launch and are seemingly invested for beyond the initial ICO volatility. They have a bot that answers questions and the team makes themselves available to answer questions their bot is not capable of fielding.

¬†

The Technology:

The Qubetics team is aiming quite high in their aspirations here. There‚Äôs a whole list of things Qubetics is aiming to tackle in their ecosystem based on their Whitepaper:

A wallet, simplify card transactions, decentralized VPN, AI integrations for blockchain developers, a system that‚Äôs ready for quantum computing, transactions that require no gas (transaction fees), SWIFT / cross border transactions for banks (similar to XRP), and asset tokenization (stocks, real estate, etc. turned into assets that can be transacted on via the blockchain).

That‚Äôs a pretty intense list. Even taking on dVPN alone is something that‚Äôs yet to be proven in practice (to my knowledge), let alone the quantum readiness and AI integration. It‚Äôs an ambitious project that, if realized, could be really game-changing for a lot of people. The issue is that to this point, the Qubetics team has yet to release a Proof of Concept for any of them, though the Whitepaper goes into some detail on their concepts. Implementation will be the key insight into whether this project will succeed or fail. I will update this once the live-stream has completed with my impressions.

The Roadmap:

At this point, Qubetics has entered its TestNet phase. This phase is the precursor to the token launch. During this phase, the team is expected to include the community for testing and feedback, and many of the preparatory items are supposed to be taking place. Time will tell during this phase, but speculative investors should be looking at the team, marketing, materials, etc. *now* to see how the team delivers. This period will tell whether or not the team can show promising, useful applications for Qubetics. Full launch is expected Q2 2025 with updates planned for Q3 and Q4 as development / optimization continues to progress.

Tokenomics:

Presale (12.85%)

Team (11.88%) ‚Äì 6mo vesting period

Ecosystem (20.85%) ‚Äì Liquidity, Rewards, etc.

Advisors (3.12%) ‚Äì 6mo vesting period

Foundation (18.23%) ‚Äì ‚ÄúQubetics Foundation‚Äù to fund promising projects on Qubetics Network

Network Ops (13.78%) ‚Äì Ops & Maint

Reserve (15%) ‚Äì Stability Reserve

Community Incentives (4.29%)

¬†

//*NOTE: Qubetics has self-reported that liquidity will be introduced in phases to manage coin launch (Whitepaper, Page 49). ‚ÄúRenowned market makers‚Äù will be engaged to assist in stabilizing the token as it becomes publicly available.*

Optimistic Translation: *As a strategy for not tanking everyone‚Äôs investment on launch, Qubetics will be managing the liquidity pool in a very controlled manner. Expect volatility but Qubetics says they‚Äôre going to bring in outside help to stabilize things for the long haul.*

Pessimistic Translation: *Qubetics has your money and the liquidity pool can be manipulated. Whether the team will have access to the liquidity pool long term or what the plans are as far as managing the liquidity pool in a way that leaves investors with confidence - that information is not known at this time.*

# My Thoughts

I went into this thinking this coin would likely be a scam. With a background largely in cybersecurity, trust is not something one should give out freely. I feel that goes doubly for the crypto space, and given the strong marketing and promotion push, I was extremely skeptical of the coin. The marketing material is good, though it highlights the potential ROI a bit to strongly over the merits of their own project. While I understand that marketing to retail investors is tricky, if you want a project to succeed and/or are not a scam, highlighting ROI while blasting one or two toned marketing materials out to a few sources without much variety really set off alarms for me as a skeptic. It‚Äôs actually what prompted me to dive in and investigate.

Once I started investigating, what I found surprised me in mostly good ways. The CEO seems to have a heavy hand in the marketing decisions based on some cursory analysis. While that set off a flag in my head, the rest of the team seems like they come from very interesting and compatible background with what they‚Äôre looking to achieve. That, along with some of the recent transparency and the ability to get a look into what things look like on TestNet are all promising signs that this project could have legs. No *visible* members of the team have histories of rugging or ruining projects, though the Smart Contract has yet to be audited by a reputable smart contract auditor or auditing service. The tokenomics seem healthy for a long-term project, with the team coming away with only \~11% of tokens. A controlled liquidity launch, while likely the safest option as far as keeping the project healthy after a launch, is also a strategy that leaves investors open to getting their money stolen right from underneath them. This does, however, put the onus on the very public-facing members of the Qubetics team to deliver an experience that should keep the coin from being extremely negatively volatile by reducing the amount of sales that can happen over a short period of time ‚Äì an experience typical of many pre-sale/ICO launches during the initial frenzy for profit-taking.

# Verdict

All that to say, I believe this project is **a toss-up, leaning towards** ***not a scam.*** Qubetics has a number of red flags and things to watch for that could easily sway my opinion, but at this time I don't think it's a scam, or if it is, they're doing a fairly decent job selling the scam as legitimate in their materials. In addition, it's also a very ambitious project that could easily fail for any number of reasons, even if it's not originally intended to *be* a scam. As far as projects go, consider this **high risk** with strong upside if the project delivers on promises.

**Things to watch for:**

**Show, don‚Äôt tell** | Look for concrete deliverables / content during the TestNet phase. Don‚Äôt settle for video, ideally look for LIVE looks or demos that aren‚Äôt just queued up videos that could have been created / rendered.

**Project Audit** | Getting the project looked at by an independent, trusted third party will play a huge role in my confidence in the project. There are a number of concerns here:

**Glaring Questions** | Who has access to the liquidity pool? What details can they provide on the ‚Äúphased‚Äù liquidity adjustments on launch? What assurances of the advertised 6mo vesting period for internals / employees / creators do investors have? Can they deliver on schedule? Do they remain transparent as launch day gets closer?

¬†

# Anyway

If you‚Äôve made it this far, your attention span is incredible. I've started creating these so you‚Äôre working with as full of a set of information as I can reasonably provide given my knowledge and research. I cannot foresee every path in every timeline, but I hope one day these investigations will either help someone avoid losing a lot of money, or to help someone make a decision that makes them rich. Good luck out there. Crypto can be such a great tool but the utility is buried in a sea of scams and shitcoins. I'd like to help clean up the space in any way I can to make it more accessible and less risky for the average person. If you have suggestions for an investigation, feedback on this one, if you think I'm wrong and got something mixed up, please feel free to comment below - I'm always looking for feedback and ways I can improve my approach.

*//NOTE: I am a Qubetics investor* ***after*** *doing this DD. I am not paid or sponsored by the organization. I do not work for Qubetics. I just feel it's important that I disclose my position. This is not intended to influence your decision and is not intended to be financial advice. Do your research, don't get scammed, and I'll see you soon for the next one!*

The Transformation: A Journey to Reclaim Vitality
-------------------------------------------------

Few stories capture attention like the tale of someone who reorganizes their entire life around health and longevity. People have an innate fascination with extraordinary transformations that speak to our fears and hopes about aging. One well-known figure, recently featured in a [documentary](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81757532&ved=2ahUKEwipjMSn2PGKAxVvEGIAHS_hBsMQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26kCqfMwDwH1PcRNFRxOLz), has gone to great lengths to slow, or even reverse, certain aspects of the aging process.

The [Netflix](netflix.com) documentary follows this wealthy individual‚Äôs daily routine in extraordinary detail ‚Äî from early morning exercise protocols to late-night biomarker assessments. The subject‚Äôs journey is more than a list of practices; it‚Äôs a deeply personal story of confronting fear, embracing discipline, and challenging cultural norms about what is possible in our later years. While some have criticized or mocked his intense dedication, others have found inspiration in his commitment to forging a new path toward prolonged vitality.

These dramatic changes, however, are not simply about personal vanity or obsession. They are driven by curiosity and a determination to unlock hidden potential in the human body. With each new test, each new tweak to his diet or supplementation program, he moves closer to refining a blueprint for health that might become more accessible and mainstream in the future. Yet one key aspect that resonates with many observers is the potential to adapt parts of this advanced routine _affordably_. That‚Äôs where Cozy Farm steps in.

In this article, we will not focus on extremes that require vast financial resources. Instead, we draw practical lessons from these practices and demonstrate how Cozy Farm offers a wealth of products that replicate or even improve upon those used in high-profile regimens ‚Äî but at a fraction of the cost. That way, you can craft a holistic, age-focused plan for yourself and your family without turning your wallet inside out.

********

Overcoming Personal Struggles: From Setbacks to a New Vision
------------------------------------------------------------

Legends often begin with adversity. Stories of dramatic health overhauls typically start with a moment of crisis: a health scare, persistent mental health challenges, or dissatisfaction with life. The figure at the center of that recent documentary mentions difficult transitions, financial pressures, and personal low points as the impetus for his transformation.

He chose to channel those experiences toward a radical mission: understanding the interplay of mind, body, and environment. He became increasingly convinced that by leveraging nutrition, consistent exercise, stress management, and leading-edge science, humans could push back the boundaries of aging and thrive well into their later decades.

While not everyone might undertake such a rigorous lifestyle, many of us can glean powerful principles about consistency, discipline, and mindful living. Individuals facing milder health setbacks can also benefit from incremental changes. When you choose to shift your diet toward whole, organic foods, incorporate a well-researched supplement regimen, and keep an active lifestyle, you start to reclaim control. [Cozy Farm](https://mycozyfarm.com)‚Äôs mission is to help you ease into these transformations by providing high-quality, cost-effective products that truly make a difference.

At the core of many longevity enthusiasts‚Äô routines is a diet that heavily features vegetables, [legumes](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/beans-legumes), fruits, [nuts](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/woodstock-farm), and [seeds](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/seeds-of-change), paired with [moderate protein](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/protein-powders) and healthy fats. The individual from the documentary can be seen preparing carefully structured meals laden with nutrients, fiber, and phytonutrients. The logic is straightforward: when your body receives an abundance of the vitamins, minerals, and other compounds it needs, it performs optimally ‚Äî from energy levels to cellular repair.

Below, we outline a sample daily meal plan inspired by these research-driven approaches. Notice how the focus is on balanced macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats), phytonutrient-rich vegetables, and anti-inflammatory spices and herbs. Best of all, Cozy Farm simplifies the process by offering [**organic lentils**](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/westbrae-foods-organic-lentils-beans-case-of-12-15-oz)¬†and [**affordable superfood staples**](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/superfoods) for a fraction of the cost you‚Äôd pay at many specialty retailers.

### Sample Morning Meal (around 9 AM)

  - **Black Lentils**(45g dry, ~150g cooked)
  - **Broccoli**(~250g, including head and stalk)
  - **Cauliflower**(~150g)
  - **Shiitake or Maitake Mushrooms**(~50g)
  - **Garlic**(1 clove)
  - **Ginger Root**(~3g)
  - **Lime**(1 whole)
  - **Cumin**(1 Tbsp)
  - **Apple Cider Vinegar**(1 Tbsp)
  - **Hemp Seeds**(1 Tbsp)
  - **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**(drizzle, ~1 Tbsp)
  - **Fermented foods**(1-4 Tbsp of cabbage, kimchi, beets, etc.)

Cozy Farm makes this type of meal both **accessible** and **affordable**:

  - [Organic Black Lentils](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/westbrae-foods-organic-black-lentils-beans-case-of-12-15-oz)‚Äì Sourced ethically and priced competitively.
  - [Fermented Foods Collection](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/fermented-foods)[](YOUR_LINK_TO_FERMENTED_FOODS)‚Äì Kimchi, sauerkraut, and more, all at wallet-friendly prices.
  - [Premium Hemp Seeds](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/manitoba-harvest)‚Äì Excellent source of protein, healthy fats, and micronutrients.

This morning meal delivers ample fiber and protein while introducing antioxidant- and mineral-rich vegetables. The pungent elements (garlic, ginger) add both flavor and health benefits, and fermented foods assist with gut health. The apple cider vinegar and lime juice bring bright acidity to liven up the dish, which can be lightly saut√©ed, steamed, or enjoyed as a warm salad.

### Sample Midday Meal (around 11 AM)

This final meal of the day might include a combination of vegetables, nuts, seeds, and berries. One popular example is a **Stuffed Sweet Potato** (~500 calories):

  - 300g cooked sweet potato
  - 45g cooked chickpeas
  - 12 grape tomatoes
  - 1/2 avocado
  - 4 radishes
  - 1/4 cup cilantro
  - 1 large jalape√±o pepper
  - 2 whole limes
  - 1 whole lemon
  - 1 tsp chili powder
  - 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil

Simply slice open the cooked sweet potato, fill it with cooked chickpeas, fresh vegetables, a squeeze of lime and lemon, a sprinkle of chili powder, and a drizzle of olive oil. Add cilantro, jalape√±o for heat, and avocado for healthy fats. If you‚Äôre partial to a bit more protein, you can toss in some [plant-based protein](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/orgain) from Cozy Farm‚Äôs selection.

If you prefer a different midday meal, simply follow the same principle: combine a robust base of vegetables, add some legumes or nuts for protein, include nutrient-dense seeds, and use spices to elevate flavor. At Cozy Farm, we carry a wide range of pantry essentials to help you tailor these meals to your liking.

********

Supplementation for Longevity
-----------------------------

In addition to meticulous meal plans, many longevity enthusiasts turn to specific supplements believed to optimize health at the cellular level. The subject of the documentary, for instance, integrates a wide range of pills throughout the day ‚Äî from essential vitamins and minerals to more advanced experimental therapies. While not everyone needs such an extensive lineup, certain supplements have broad, research-backed benefits.

Below is a sample supplement routine to illustrate the concept. We‚Äôve indicated which supplements are generally useful for most adults (*****) and which are conditionally recommended based on biomarkers (******)

Cozy Farm proudly offers many of these supplements in high-quality, budget-friendly formulations.

### Morning Supplement Routine

Tailoring Nutrition and Supplements to Hormonal Cycles
------------------------------------------------------

While the documentary subject‚Äôs approach may be generalized to many individuals, physiological differences exist between men and women, as well as among those in different stages of life. Let‚Äôs explore some key considerations for premenopausal and postmenopausal women:

### Premenopausal Women

During the follicular phase of a woman‚Äôs cycle, the body experiences improved insulin sensitivity. This period may be optimal for increased carbohydrate intake (preferably from complex, unprocessed sources) while maintaining moderate protein. As estrogen levels rise, muscle repair and growth can be more efficient, so it is a good time to engage in higher-intensity workouts.

In the luteal phase, insulin sensitivity decreases, meaning a slight reduction in carbs and a proportional increase in protein and healthy fats can be beneficial for stable energy and metabolic support. This phase is also associated with higher progesterone, which can have a catabolic effect on muscle. Therefore, emphasizing protein intake and supportive nutrients becomes crucial.

Supplements that may be particularly helpful during the luteal phase include:

  - **Magnesium**‚Äì Aids muscle relaxation, sleep quality, and stress management.
  - **Ashwagandha**‚Äì Helps modulate cortisol, alleviating stress-induced fatigue.
  - **Rhodiola Rosea**‚Äì Known for its adaptogenic properties, beneficial for energy and mood.
  - **Sodium and Potassium**‚Äì Key electrolytes that support hydration and reduce bloating.

[Cozy Farm Female Support Supplements](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/womens-health-1)[](YOUR_LINK_TO_FEMALE_SUPPORT) are formulated to help navigate these shifts economically, without sacrificing quality.

### Postmenopausal Women

Estrogen levels drop significantly after menopause, leading to changes in bone density, muscle mass, and cardiovascular risk. To mitigate these effects, postmenopausal women often benefit from:

  - **Higher Protein Intake**‚Äì Helps maintain muscle mass and strength.
  - **Calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) and Vitamin D (2000 IU/day)**‚Äì Supports bone density and reduces fracture risk.
  - **Healthy Fats**‚Äì Including omega-3 fatty acids for heart health and hormonal balance.

[Calcium + Vitamin D Supplements](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/vitamin-d) from Cozy Farm provide an easy and cost-effective way to secure these nutrients. Combined with a balanced diet and regular weight-bearing exercise, these supplements can form the cornerstone of a postmenopausal health plan that is both **thorough** and **financially accessible**.

********

Traveling the Globe for Procedures and Cutting-Edge Therapies
-------------------------------------------------------------

The documentary‚Äôs subject travels extensively, exploring advanced medical procedures for longevity. Yet, not everyone can or should follow such a path. The excitement in the longevity field stems from a rapidly evolving research landscape, but many interventions are costly and still in early experimental phases.

In contrast, the fundamentals of a healthful lifestyle remain relatively stable: **nutritious foods, regular exercise, adequate rest, stress reduction, and essential supplementation** can have a profound effect on how we age. By focusing on these core elements, you lay a strong foundation that may reduce the need for high-cost, experimental procedures.

Cozy Farm‚Äôs approach values practicality and inclusivity. Rather than waiting for the next big anti-aging breakthrough, we encourage our community to embrace a holistic framework: balanced meals, active days, mindful living, and consistent, research-backed supplementation. This framework, accessible to anyone, can often be just as transformative when applied diligently.

********

Navigating Public Perceptions: Hype, Criticism, and Real Solutions
------------------------------------------------------------------

The individual at the center of the documentary has faced both fascination and backlash for his age-reversal endeavors. Such extreme health experiments inevitably invite controversy, from accusations of vanity to disbelief about efficacy. Yet this broader conversation also reveals how deeply people care about health, aging, and the desire to find cost-effective, science-driven solutions.

On one hand, sensational headlines can overshadow thoughtful discourse. Readers might see the financial extremes and dismiss the entire concept as elitist or out of reach. On the other hand, curiosity can spark a willingness to learn more about daily routines, dietary patterns, and proven supplements. This same curiosity might lead someone to discover Cozy Farm as an alternative source of high-value health products.

We believe that bridging the gap between aspiration and reality is key. Yes, there are those who spend millions annually. But for the rest of us, there exists a wealth of scientific knowledge that can be applied in a more measured, budget-friendly way. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods, consistent movement, robust sleep, and supplementation tailored to individual needs, it‚Äôs possible to approach the ideals of these high-profile longevity seekers without veering into financial impracticality.

********

Building Your Own Holistic Routine ‚Äî The Cozy Farm Way
------------------------------------------------------

A successful longevity plan isn‚Äôt built overnight. It involves deliberate, incremental changes informed by personal health goals and data. While the documentary‚Äôs subject employs a team of professionals and undergoes extensive testing, there are straightforward steps you can adopt to get started:

  1. **Track Your Baseline.**Whether it‚Äôs regular check-ups, home testing kits, or simple bloodwork, gather basic information about your current health status. Markers like glucose levels, blood pressure, cholesterol, and vitamin deficiencies can offer insights into which areas need the most attention.
  2. **Choose Whole, Organic Foods.**Cozy Farm makes this easy with a range of [organic pantry staples](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/organic-foods)[](YOUR_LINK_TO_ORGANIC_PRODUCTS)and fresh produce. Transition gradually: swap refined grains for whole grains, add one extra serving of vegetables at each meal, and explore healthy fats.
  3. **Tailor Your Supplements.**Evaluate what you truly need. A standard multivitamin might be a good start, followed by targeted supplements based on your unique profile. Check out [Cozy Farm‚Äôs supplement selection](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/health-supplements)[](YOUR_LINK_TO_SUPPLEMENTS)to find the perfect match for your lifestyle.
  4. **Stay Active.**Regular movement ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs brisk walking, strength training, yoga, or cycling ‚Äî can profoundly influence the aging process. Find an activity you enjoy to increase consistency.
  5. **Optimize Sleep.**Quality sleep is integral for cellular repair, hormone balance, and cognitive function. Consider establishing a bedtime routine and examining factors like room temperature, screen time, and relaxing pre-bed rituals.
  6. **Manage Stress.**Chronic stress accelerates wear and tear on the body. Techniques like mindfulness meditation, gentle stretches, journaling, or seeking therapy can keep stress in check. Even spending a few minutes in nature daily can have a remarkable impact on mental well-being.
  7. **Reassess and Adjust.**Health is dynamic. Regularly check in on your progress. Have your vitamin levels improved? Are you feeling more energetic? Adjust your plan accordingly, ideally with the guidance of a healthcare professional.

********

Potential Advanced Therapies: A Cautious Perspective
----------------------------------------------------

Some emerging therapies, such as gene editing, stem cell treatments, and specialized peptide interventions, have caught the public‚Äôs imagination. While glimpses of promise exist, these interventions are usually cost-prohibitive and remain under rigorous scientific scrutiny. The documentary we‚Äôre referencing showcases the subject traveling internationally to experiment with such procedures.

Though the allure is undeniable, many of these methods need further validation. It‚Äôs crucial to weigh the pros, cons, and financial feasibility. For most, focusing on foundational health practices ‚Äî the type Cozy Farm champions ‚Äî yields excellent returns on investment. If someday advanced interventions become mainstream and more affordable, those already practicing robust self-care will be well-positioned to benefit.

********

Overcoming Barriers: Time, Cost, and Motivation
-----------------------------------------------

Integrating a longevity-oriented routine can seem daunting, especially for busy individuals juggling work, family, and personal obligations. Many fear that a health overhaul might be both time-consuming and expensive. The truth is, while certain adjustments demand planning, they need not be overwhelming or overly costly.

By sourcing direct from farmers and reputable suppliers, we keep prices competitive without sacrificing quality. Additionally, purchasing through Cozy Farm‚Äôs online platform can save you travel time and help you avoid impulse buys at traditional stores.

Motivation, of course, is a personal journey. Some find inspiration in success stories ‚Äî the transformation arcs featured in documentaries ‚Äî while others are driven by improved biomarker readings. Whatever your catalyst, know that small daily changes compound over time. Each balanced meal, each supplement dose, and each workout or stretch session is an investment in your future self.

********

Shaping a Community of Support
------------------------------

The longevity movement isn‚Äôt just about individuals striving for personal gain; it‚Äôs about communities learning and supporting one another. Documentaries that explore extreme transformations highlight the need for nuanced conversation. Yes, it can be easy to dismiss these health pioneers as outliers, but if you look deeper, you might find ideas adaptable to your own life.

Cozy Farm envisions a world where these discussions extend beyond sensational headlines. Our online community provides cooking tips, supplement advice, and access to wellness professionals who share credible insights on living more vibrantly for longer. By facilitating open dialogue and offering accessible products, we hope to remove barriers for anyone interested in forging their own path to better health.

Consider joining our newsletters or social media channels, where you can ask questions, share experiences, and learn practical tips on everything from hydration strategies to mindful snacking. Together, we can create an environment that fosters continual self-improvement and mutual encouragement.

********

Final Reflections: Embrace the Present, Build the Future
--------------------------------------------------------

While the story of a high-profile individual pouring resources into age-reversal strategies is captivating, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that the real power of longevity lies in consistency and accessibility. The body‚Äôs resilience responds to incremental, well-targeted efforts. Combining a nutrient-dense diet, thoughtful supplementation, sufficient sleep, and balanced exercise can propel anyone toward improved energy, mental clarity, and physical vitality.

For those intrigued by more ambitious therapies, keep an open but critical mind. Research in the longevity field evolves rapidly, and what‚Äôs experimental today may become commonplace tomorrow. Yet it‚Äôs the foundation you establish right now that will help you take full advantage of future discoveries.

At **Cozy Farm**, our mission is to make these foundational steps both _doable_and _economically sensible_. Age-defying health regimens need not be an exclusive club. By shopping with us, you support our efforts to expand availability of high-quality, organic, and sustainable products for all. You also invest in your own longevity and well-being, laying down the building blocks of a healthier tomorrow.

Regardless of where you currently stand on the spectrum of health ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre in the prime of life or seeking ways to enhance vitality post-retirement ‚Äî the principles discussed here hold immense potential. They can be customized, scaled, and integrated into the hustle of daily life. If you take away only one lesson from this deep dive, let it be that small, consistent, evidence-based decisions can yield profound results.

********

Practical Steps to Get Started
------------------------------

  1. **Evaluate Your Pantry:**Clear out processed, high-sugar items. Replace them with organic beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds.
  2. **Plan Meals Ahead:**Cook in batches using Cozy Farm‚Äôs bulk organic ingredients. Store leftovers for quick weekday meals.
  3. **Consider Targeted Supplements:**Start with an essential supplement kit to cover your bases. Then add or remove items based on how you feel and what your bloodwork suggests.
  4. **Track Progress:**Keep a simple journal or use an app to monitor symptoms, energy levels, and any shifts in mood or sleep patterns.
  5. **Ask for Support:**Engage family or friends. Join Cozy Farm‚Äôs community forums for recipe swaps, product tips, and moral support.

By creating a plan that fits your budget and time constraints, you can sustainably move toward the longevity goals that resonate with you. There‚Äôs no need to risk your financial stability or feel chained to a rigid blueprint. Health is a personalized journey, and you have the freedom to choose how you walk it.

********

Make Your Move: The Time Is Now
-------------------------------

People often delay adopting a healthy routine until an urgent crisis strikes, whether it‚Äôs a warning from a doctor or a sudden decline in vitality. The stories showcased in longevity documentaries might seem extreme, but they serve as potent reminders that aging is real and certain aspects of it _are_within our influence. If you‚Äôve ever contemplated taking steps to future-proof your health, now is the best moment to begin.

Remember, no single plan can guarantee an extended lifespan. Yet ample evidence indicates that strategic nutrition, movement, restorative sleep, and targeted supplementation can **increase health span** ‚Äî the period of life spent in good health. By partnering with Cozy Farm, you gain access to ethically sourced, carefully vetted goods that make this journey smoother and more affordable.

So whether your motivation is to keep up with grandchildren, excel in your career, or simply savor life‚Äôs daily joys for longer, consider [exploring Cozy Farm‚Äôs offerings](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/all-products). Let us be your ally in crafting an approach to wellness that fits your lifestyle and budget, without compromising on quality. Embrace the present by nourishing your body and mind today, and you‚Äôll be setting a powerful precedent for tomorrow.

********

Empowered Aging for Everyone
----------------------------

The path to longevity can seem intimidating when viewed through the lens of extreme regimens and astronomical expenses. However, a more inclusive perspective shows that many of the same principles ‚Äî nutrient-dense diets, functional exercise, targeted supplementation, and mindful living ‚Äî are well within reach for the average individual.

Documentaries spotlighting high-level health enthusiasts spark questions we can all benefit from asking: _How can we optimize our daily habits?__How might we address our shortcomings before they become chronic issues?__How can we align health with fiscal responsibility?_
Cozy Farm‚Äôs focus on quality, affordability, and a broad range of organic products makes it simpler for anyone to adopt healthy habits and enjoy the benefits that these documentary figures chase so intensively. We celebrate the curiosity fueling age-reversal innovators, but we also embrace a balanced approach that honors individual differences and resource constraints.

Ultimately, the greatest takeaway is to **start where you are**. Infuse each day with the best choices you can manage, from your kitchen to your supplement cabinet. Whether you‚Äôre looking to replicate pieces of a regimen showcased in viral media or just want to prioritize well-being, Cozy Farm stands ready to support your journey. Together, let‚Äôs redefine what it means to age ‚Äî not with fear, but with empowerment and vitality.

Manifesto from Andrew Baldwin's Interview on DD - Part 1,Delphitrial,1hy5n5k,2025-01-10 09:31:08,78,0.99,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delphitrial/comments/1hy5n5k/manifesto_from_andrew_baldwins_interview_on_dd/,kvol69,Discussion,"I've had 30 cups of coffee and I deeply regret volunteering myself for this project. However, I am committed to making detailed notes. Mr. Baldwin was rambling, followed disconnected associations, broke temporal continuity mid-story to flash forward/backward in time, and changed the subject he was speaking about mid-sentence. It was difficult to follow his reasoning, but I now understand the creative force behind the Franks memo.

\- Bob and Ali introduce the podcast and express excitement about the ongoing interviews.

\- Andrew Baldwin joins the podcast and there is a discussion about vinyl collecting and music appreciation.

\- Baldwin gives some background information on his family, upbringing, and a variety of jobs he worked prior to attending law school.

\- He stops this narrative to point out that ""Law school certainly doesn‚Äôt teach you what to do when Odinists are guarding your client, for example, but how to deal with it, you might have learned from someone who came into the Dairy Queen and how you dealt with that.""

\- He applied to 10 law schools, but he was only accepted at the University of Akron which is where he attended. One of his children has also entered the profession and was recently accepted as a public defender.

\- Baldwin mentions that his son‚Äôs law school term paper topic was an examination of how police police themselves, with an emphasis on effectiveness and optimizing that process.

\- He has a diatribe about key LE figures in the case: ‚ÄúIn this case, with everything that was going on, I actually went to the State Police Internal Affairs to report what I thought was some wrongdoing that was going on. We can talk about that later. And that was an hour-long conversation, and I have heard crickets - not so shockingly - since that conversation happened, reporting a variety of what I thought were wrong deeds and wrongdoing. Jerry Holeman and Doug Carter out calling us and calling me in particular ‚Äòunethical.‚Äô I want to say right now at the top, please file something against me. Please file an ethics violation; there is a disciplinary board here that monitors lawyers, and if I‚Äôve done something that is truly unethical, then I would beg you to file something. The problem is, I haven‚Äôt, so much like everything else they‚Äôve done, they spout a bunch of stuff without the facts to back it up, and they hope that it sticks, and people will be out there believing it, and we‚Äôll get hate mail and all that kind of thing. Whereas the personal offense that they took was all backed up with facts, with reports, with audio, with depositions. So I never made any accusation of any type, including to their internal affairs department, that wasn‚Äôt backed up. Their Internal Affairs Department ‚Äì or whatever it‚Äôs called ‚Äì never bothered to come down here and look at anything or review anything or delve into their leaks that we had pretty strong evidence of that they were leaking.‚Äù

\- Baldwin returns to the topic of his son‚Äôs term paper, which he admits he has not read.

\- Bob explains that he took offense to how Baldwin and Rozzi were being characterized online after being assigned to the case, and took the initiative to reach out to the defense team to offer support.

\- Baldwin mentions that he considers Bob a friend or colleague, and Ali, even though he does not know her as well.

\- Baldwin talks about how he is in awe of David Hennessy and connected professionally with him for a few years, learning a great deal from him.

\- Baldwin reiterates that he talked to Bob as a friend and colleague interested in the craft of legal strategies.

\- He mentions that he believes people have the mistaken impression that the defense team listened to all these podcasts and wanted crazy conspiracy theories spewed out there. (He begins to jump around with a bunch of half sentences, but explains that he doesn‚Äôt know who any of the central figures are in social media, persons of interest, or podcasters from memory.)

\- Baldwin states ‚ÄúJerry Holeman was recently on a podcast that somebody told him about, and said that even during the trial we were violating the gag order and talking and revealing infor...that‚Äôs just a lie! That‚Äôs just not true. Was I talking to Bob Motta during the trial? And to Andrea Burkhart...and to Lawyer Lee and others that were friendly? Gosh I‚Äôm a human being who likes for people to like me to talk to them for a second and get some affirmation. Did that work? Did that not work? That‚Äôs not leaking information, that‚Äôs trying to be a better lawyer and friendly person.‚Äù

\- Ali begins to tell an anecdote about how Bob and Baldwin connected, but she‚Äôs incorrect; she was beginning the story of an incident involving David Hennessy speaking very loudly in court.

\- Baldwin recounts how he actually connected with Bob on Halloween, and he was told about Bob by his wife. His wife referred to him as ‚Äúone of those guys‚Äù and then he shifts to say someone is calling Bob a shill for the defense, and that he would expect Bob to be pro-defense based on the title of the program and the little information he had about him. He then asks if he can tell a story about October 31^(st), and then goes on several tangents.

\- After being removed from the case, Baldwin was adamant about not being reinstated. Deeply distressed by the events that transpired, he believed his career was over, that Jerry Holeman had ‚Äúwon‚Äù because he went out and conducted an investigation into him. He claims that Holeman had a conflict of interest because Baldwin had been going after him. He alleges that Holeman deliberately targeted him for an investigation because he wanted him off the case. He says they will return to the issue of Holeman wanting Baldwin arrested and charged with a crime, and he classifies it as ‚Äúthird world banana republic stuff.‚Äù

\- He returns to recount the events leading up to October 31^(st), sharing that he received a call from Rozzi, inquiring about his intentions regarding the case. Baldwin explains that he declined any involvement, stating he lacked the emotional capacity to handle the case and believed his return would not benefit the client. Rozzi expressed his frustration and disgust, admonishing Baldwin not to let ‚Äúthem‚Äù get away with this and using strong language to criticize his hesitation. Although Baldwin eventually agreed with Rozzi‚Äôs sentiment, he remained hesitant. However, after receiving support and encouragement from Cara Wieneke, Mark Leeman, and many others, he found renewed determination to rejoin the case and fight for reinstatement as Richard Allen‚Äôs defense counsel.

\- They formulated a strategy to file in as the attorneys representing Richard Allen pro bono if Judge Gull would not allow them back on the case. Baldwin emphasizes that the partners in his law firm gave him latitude to devote all his attention to the case, and their support did not waver even when he indicated that they would be doing the work pro bono (which had a high potential to bankrupt the firm).

\- He finally discusses the day of 10/31/2023: The night before, Baldwin and Rozzi filed to be reinstated on the case pro bono. The other lawyers who were assigned by Judge Gull were waiting with them in the jury room. Richard Allen arrives, and they explain that per their previous conversation, they will try to get back on the case, and he introduces the new lawyers who will handle the case if they are unsuccessful at being reinstated. Judge Gull arrives and takes the bench, ignores them, and acknowledges the new attorneys.

\- Ali interrupts to clarify if Judge Gull deviated from procedure in announcing representation; Baldwin verified she did not.

\- Baldwin points out that they felt alienated and alone, and he becomes sentimental, complimenting Rozzi and his loyalty to him during the crime scene photo leak. He says he will love Brad Rozzi until the day he dies.

\- Bob points out he was in court with them on that day, and discloses that they had previously been exchanging text or email messages regarding strategies to be restored on the case.

\- Bob recounts the story of Judge Gull giving a speech in which she tears Baldwin and Rozzi a new asshole, and then tells Richard Allen that although she knows he has requested to retain the same counsel, she cannot in good conscience allow it because they are grossly negligent and incompetent.

\- Baldwin laments that the reporting on the case has not reflected the type of investigative journalism that would challenge the official narratives, which is what he thinks it warrants.

\- He pivots to discuss the Franks memo. He discusses skepticism that critics have actually read the memo, since it was so thoroughly documented and supported with abundant notations and references. He encourages any journalist to use the Franks memo as a roadmap, and to interview all of the names mentioned in the memo.

\- Bob replies that Defense Diaries is fulfilling that role, and Ali points out that he means traditional journalists, not podcasters.

\- Bob goes on a tangent about the decay of the legacy media, points out that the vast majority of people consume their news from social media, and that the current platforms have a much bigger audience than traditional media outlets.

\- Bob asks how Baldwin was initially pulled into the case.

\- Baldwin explains he was working on many cases, the most important of which was an LWOP case (life without the possibility of parole).

\- He pauses the story to say that McLeland, Holeman, and all those guys would be shocked to know that he is very well-liked and respected all over the state. He emphasizes that he is saying that humbly, and he has practiced without issues over the last three decades.

\- The LWOP case resolved via an agreement with the prosecutors.

\- Rozzi cold-called Baldwin. Baldwin was familiar with him as the go-to lawyer with complex and high-profile cases that required a tactician to navigate. Rozzi received his name from Stacey Uliana.

\- Baldwin points out that just today, Stacey Uliana was assigned to Richard Allen‚Äôs case as an appellate attorney.

\- Per Baldwin, once Uliana learned Judge Gull was on the case, she declined to participate. He stops suddenly mid-explanation as to why this was an issue for Uliana.

\- Baldwin confirms to Rozzi that he is available, and is informed that Judge Gull will contact him to vet him.

\- He states that he was already acquainted with Judge Gull‚Äôs daughter, who is a very good prosecutor. He takes a call from Judge Gull, and she approves adding him to the case.

\- Bob has a monologue about wanting to have the defense team featured in interviews on the channel to humanize the defense attorneys after attempts to destroy their reputations and question their integrity.

\- Ali asks for Baldwin‚Äôs first impression of Richard Allen when they finally met.

\- Baldwin states that initially ‚Äì before Allen was in solitary for so long ‚Äì he was confused and asserting his innocence.

\- He states that initially, the defense team was treated well by the staff in Westville. He claims that John Galipeau (the former warden) told many lies, and points out an example regarding the lawyers having cell phones in the facility.

\- He relates that Allen was being kept in a completely separate building that was so far away, they had to be transported to the location via golf cart. He described the building as gross, the worst building he had seen in the IDOC system, he likened it to an old asylum and says it looks similar to the setting of a horror movie. They were shown into a captain‚Äôs office, and Allen was brought in ‚Äúlike Hannibal Lecter in chains.‚Äù He explains that Allen's movement was so restricted that he was not able to lift a bottle of water to his lips, Baldwin had to do it for him. (Presumably this would be with the traditional belly chains with cuffs linked to them that restrict movement.)

\- He states that Richard Allen was confused, and he believed whatever Allen asserted in that initial meeting.

\- Baldwin jumps forward to speak about the trial. He states that the courthouse guards were very nice and sweet, and professional in their interactions. He talks about having lunch in the courthouse basement with Allen throughout the trial. He points out that his client loves Taco Bell, and is a very funny guy. During one of those lunch breaks Allen told him about their first meeting.  Apparently Baldwin came over and hugged Allen in the initial meeting, and that was the first human positive contact he had with anyone since his arrest.

\- Baldwin returns to his account of their initial meeting. He thought Allen was an innocent guy. Baldwin said he prepared himself for the possibility that he would learn his client committed the crime as he learned more information, but that he never saw any proof that he was responsible for the crimes.

\- Bob asks if Baldwin is aware of how Allen is faring post-sentencing. He says he does not have any information, and the last time he spoke to him was just after the sentencing hearing.

\- Baldwin expresses that he had initially planned to confront Holeman after the hearing regarding statements he made, but Auger took care of that. He stated that he had previous confrontations with Holeman but decided it was not appropriate, and Auger handled the situation more tactfully.

\- He instead followed Allen out, and wanted to point out that the theme of the sentencing had been to pressure Allen to not pursue appeals if he was genuine in his religious beliefs.

\- He states that Allen is a good human being, does not like that the families do not have closure, and, even as an innocent person, he is upset by the crime scene photographs.

\- At the end of the sentencing hearing, Allen had been asked by Judge Gull if he would like to pursue an appeal, and Baldwin was concerned that he might not answer in the affirmative.

\- Ali interrupts and speculates that Judge Gull attempted to use the pressure of the hearing to manipulate Allen into declining an appeal. Baldwin deflected.

\- Baldwin points out that Allen‚Äôs post-sentencing experience differs from all other convicted defendants. Rather than being picked up at the convenience of prison transportation, he was transported to the Regional Diagnostic Center (where classification of incoming inmates occurs,) the same day. Typically, inmates are processed in 3-4 weeks before being assigned a location, but six days later, the process was complete and Allen was already back in Westville.

\- Baldwin points out that there are other IDOC facilities with more robust mental health services, and he cannot believe that he was placed back in Westville. He classifies that decision as weird, sad, disturbing, and horrible, and insists Allen should‚Äôve been placed in a facility where he does not have bad memories.

\- Bob replies that there is a large volume of psychological warfare on inmates, and that no one can look at this case objectively and think there‚Äôs anything less than a vested interest to quickly redirect public attention. He feigns concern for the victims‚Äô family, and speculates that they will be panicked and not updated about the appeal process by McLeland.

\- Bob asks how often a pretrial detainee is kept in a prison in Indiana. Baldwin says this case is the first time it has happened in his time practicing law. He was given a statistic that seven other pretrial detainees were in the IDOC system, but they were extremely disruptive or problematic in the jail, and were moved into IDOC because they posed a danger to themselves and others.

\- He states that Allen‚Äôs case is unique, in that he was sent directly to the prison without a lawyer, without a hearing, and without any evidence being shown to prove he deserved to be housed there.

\- He points out that Max Baker did excellent work in reviewing and preparing the presentation of Allen‚Äôs incarceration videos, and he is glad he did not have to personally view them, as he found them too upsetting when he briefly watched.

\- Bob compliments Rozzi on his work to shine a light on conditions of confinement that were so far outside the norm.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that he appreciates good lawyering, and remarks that he approached Deaner to compliment her on her work during the admissibility of the ‚Äúso-called confessions‚Äù during pretrial hearing on July 30^(th). He indicates he commended Luttrell a couple of times during the trial for quality work. He alludes to a conversation with McLeland on his cross of Dawn Perlmutter during the pre-trial hearings, where he complimented him, but also says that McLeland stepped into a trap that he doesn‚Äôt know about.

\- Bob asks about a bond hearing that he attended in February.

\-Baldwin explains that murder was not bondable in Indiana before changes were made a few years ago. Now, a bond hearing is like a mini-trial where the state must prove they have a strong case against the accused.

\- Baldwin mentions that until September 2023, they didn't have access to key elements of discovery, such as Libby‚Äôs phone and Todd Click‚Äôs documentation. He knew about the ""Odinism stuff"" starting in March 2023 from a 12-page report by Murphy. They reviewed 3.5 million pieces of evidence (paper, photos, video, and audio files) that were received in September 2023, making Baldwin think they should have insisted on the bond hearing in February 2023. He believes the prosecution wouldn‚Äôt have been ready, and they could have used that opportunity to lock them into a narrative. In retrospect, he agrees with David Hennessy, who advised going ahead with the hearing.

\- Bob transitions by saying, ‚Äúspeaking of the Devil,‚Äù and asks Baldwin about developing the Franks memo, speculating about why it was drafted. Baldwin rejects Bob‚Äôs theory and explains that he initially filed a generic motion to suppress. He preferred this approach because specific motions indicate to law enforcement that they need to investigate further. At first, Baldwin believed the PCA wasn‚Äôt strong enough for charges and filed based on that, but it was unsuccessful.

\- Baldwin gently rejects his theory. Initially, Baldwin filed a generic motion to suppress. He cites that specific motions to suppress indicate to LE that there is something they need to rectify or investigate further and it helps them solve the case, so he leans towards a more generic document. Initially, he thought that the PCA was not enough to warrant charges, and filed on that alone but was not successful.

\- After reviewing statements by Betsy Blair and Sarah Carbaugh, he felt that the prosecution failed to convey the complete story to Judge Diener. He contacted McLeland to inform him that he would be pursuing Liggett because he believes that information should have been included for consideration. Baldwin was informed by his interns that he might need to file a Franks memo, but he insisted that a motion to suppress should be sufficient.

\- McLeland informed him that he was going to ask for a continuance, and was informed that the motion needed to be filed as a Franks memo instead, and that was verified with the judge. Baldwin acknowledges that he had never had to prepare one before, but he was happy to oblige since his original motion to suppress was filed generically.

\- Regarding the contents of the Franks memo, Rozzi and Baldwin battled over the scope of it. Baldwin said he believed he was going to win based on the Franks memo alone. He thinks it will be an appellate issue that the Franks memo should have at a minimum warranted a hearing, but that it also should‚Äôve been ruled on and granted.

\- He says that the process developed organically. He traveled down to Georgia with his colleagues, and when they returned they conducted depositions. Jerry Holeman was deposed, and that entire week he felt exposed some deliberate omissions by LE. He then examined the discovery looking specifically for information related to that narrative, and found several POIs and evidence of their involvement. As he continued to sift through the discovery, he had to keep adding to the Franks memo as he found more information ‚Äúwhich had not been given.‚Äù (From the notetaker ‚Äì I believe what he is conveying is that they were given this information, since he was obviously examining it, but it was not highlighted as pertinent or significant to the case.)

\- He raises the concern about the mimicked crime scene photo on Brad Holder‚Äôs Facebook page. He does not name Holder but says the name is included in the memo. In March 2023, he found a report from Ryan Winters where a sleuth from Georgia called to point out the photo and other details about Holder that seemed suspicious. Baldwin indicates that there were many reports about both the photo and Holder‚Äôs activities. But Winters was one of a handful of investigators who had seen the crime scene, and saw parallels between the crime scene and photos.

\- Baldwin indicates that he wanted to reach out to McLeland to find where the photo was located in discovery, but he did not feel he could trust them. The person in Georgia that had possession of the photo was Ryan Boucher, and he was reluctant to forward or hand over his information remotely, so part of the team traveled down to meet with him.

\- Baldwin first viewed the image while in Georgia, and was shocked at the parallels to the crime scene: two girls on a forest floor, mimicking death, and with branches covering them. He also was concerned that Holder was acquainted with Abby. They collected that photo from Boucher and traveled back to Indiana.

\- They held onto the photo and only revealed they were in possession of it during Holeman‚Äôs deposition on August 10^(th). He claims that he and Rozzi ‚Äúplayed dumb‚Äù about Holder being a POI, Odinism, and runes. They asked Holeman about all of these subjects, and he asserted that had LE been forthcoming in that week, that they would‚Äôve volunteered the information that they were aware of Holder, had thoroughly investigated him, and the reasons why he was cleared.

\- During the first part of Holeman‚Äôs deposition, Baldwin handed a copy of Murphy‚Äôs Odinism report which Holeman then read. He claimed to not be familiar with the document and questioned its origin. Baldwin then showed him the mimicked crime scene photo they had collected, and Holeman was dismissive.

\- Baldwin pauses to explain that he did not plan to do any media because he was severely emotionally impacted by the trial, and just wanted the process to continue. However, after watching the post-sentencing LE press conference, comments made by Jerry Holeman and Doug Carter compelled him to grant this interview. He alluded to other media appearances that are planned.

\- Baldwin returns to the August 10 deposition of Jerry Holeman he gave him the document from Trooper Murphy, and asked him to take it with him to investigate. After the deposition ended, Holeman left and encountered Murphy who was waiting to be deposed.

\- In his deposition Murphy says that he was approached by Holeman, showed him the document, and asked ‚Äúhow the fuck did they get this?‚Äù Baldwin overheard the commotion.

\- Ali suggested that Holeman was already aware of the existence of the document, and that LE was trying to keep it from the defense. Baldwin agrees that is how he interpreted the situation.

\- Ryan Winters in his report indicates that he approached Holeman at some point to show him the mimicked photo, and insisted that Holder be re-investigated and re-interviewed but it was never done.

\- Baldwin then explains that the mimicked crime scene photo is then \*poof\* gone. (Indicating that it was deleted from Holder‚Äôs Facebook page). He characterizes the photo as an exculpatory evidence, and says that it does not exist anywhere else other than the copy they physically retrieved from Boucher on their trip to Georgia.

\- Trooper Roland Purdy previously testified twice during the deposition phase that he saw the photos on Holder‚Äôs social media, but he did not think it was of any value. A couple of days later when he was recalled for testimony by the Prosecution, Baldwin recounts that Purdy changed his testimony and said his recollection was mistaken about the photo.

\- Ali expresses frustration that a judge would allow Purdy to be recalled to update his testimony.

\- Baldwin points out that the photo is missing, that recordings of interviews with third-party suspects are also missing, and he sees a common theme.

\- He argues that the theme is that all of the photos, interview recordings, and everything that he tied into the Franks memo were the pieces of evidence that disappeared.

\- Ali asks if Baldwin would be permitted to distribute them since they are part of the exhibit record, Bob suggests that the documents already uploaded on a specific subreddit. Ali receives a message indicating that Bob is mistaken.

\- Baldwin tried in the Franks memo to describe visual elements, an example being a Goodfellas meme about best friends helping you move bodies, posted by a POI a few days after the murders.

\- Per Baldwin, ‚Äúfrom their own Pat Cicero...I mean‚Ä¶there...it could easily be argued that they needed to move - two people to move those bodies for that for them to be positioned the way that they were and the way that the blood. And if you get into the forensic photo data...there...you know it could have...those bodies...the phone...you know, the phone could have um uh at 4:33 a.m. it could‚Äôve been in somebody‚Äôs outbuilding, it could‚Äôve been in somebody‚Äôs house in and around where they ultimately were. It connects with the tower at 4:33 a.m., they take it out of a feral bag (I think he misspoke, and meant Faraday bag), they take it out of a refrigerator, or it just - they just walk it a couple of steps it doesn‚Äôt record on the Apple Health Data. And then it um and then the phone um connects with the tower and then all that activity causes it to die very quickly. That‚Äôs probably exactly what happened.‚Äù

\- He states he believes Stacy Eldridge confirms that the above-listed quote is probably what happened.

\- He compliments Chris Cecil, characterizes him as an honorable guy, and he loves that. He implies he has admiration for any cop that is honest ‚Äì listing Kevin Murphy, Todd Click, and (Greg) Ferency as other examples of honest cops.

\- Ali asks a question about the brand of phone case on Libby‚Äôs phone, as based on her research it can cause the iPhone to register an inaccurate audio output state. She speculates that the phantom headphone detection could be from the girls crossing some body of water at 5:33 p.m. and deliberately protecting the phone but she cuts herself off after acknowledging she does not know how to explain how it was then unplugged.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that one aspect of the case that they definitely could‚Äôve shown improvement with was disputing the State‚Äôs timeline.

\- He does not want to broach the subject of strategy because he hopes to be on this trial next time.

\- The Prosecution made a big deal out of the fact that the phone did not move until discovered by investigators. Baldwin characterizes this as conjecture, stating that the phone would not show if it remained in a car, or if it is in one place for a long stretch of time until the battery dies at 4:33 a.m. He states once the battery is dead you can pick up the phone, go across the river, and place the phone underneath Abby‚Äôs body and it will not register any movement.

\- Baldwin asserts that he does not believe that Libby‚Äôs phone was at the crime scene at 4:33 a.m., he believes it was in a different location. He said that the evidence supports this assertion, and the Apple health app corroborates the claim.

\- Ali asks if a jammer could‚Äôve been in use, Bob suggests a Faraday bag, and Baldwin says all of those things could‚Äôve been used to explain the findings from Libby‚Äôs phone.

\- He claims that the Prosecution‚Äôs theory that the phone was under ‚Äúthat body‚Äù (Abby) has been debunked, but does not elaborate.

\- He states that he doesn‚Äôt at all believe that ‚Äúthose bodies‚Äù were there on the 13^(th.)

\- Baldwin is even more vehement that the crime could not have been committed by a single perpetrator, and certainly not have happened in the middle of the day without anyone hearing the crime.

\- He states that the evidence and common sense do not support the single perpetrator in daylight hours theory.

\- He postulates that the offenders were nearby on 2/14/17, saw the phone die, and moved the bodies into place, or the murders occurred after 4:33 a.m.

\- He explains that the defense did a poor job of explaining how the evidence supports the above-listed scenario, and upon reflection they could‚Äôve communicated that better throughout the trial with their cross-examinations.

\- Bob asks about Darrell Sterrett‚Äôs trial testimony where he did not recall the lighting conditions, but was interviewed on the first episode of the Down the Hill Podcast where he spoke about the nighttime search and lighting conditions.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that one of the deficiencies in their case was that the Defense did not listen to podcasts where trial witnesses were previously interviewed so that they could recognize discrepancies.

\- Baldwin says that he repeatedly failed to relate the Defense‚Äôs story through cross-examination.

\- He highlights that Sterrett‚Äôs podcast interview revealed that the clothing found in the creek was not there overnight, and therefore the victims‚Äô bodies were also not there.

\- Ali references an aspect of the prior interview with Jennifer Auger, where they suggest a new field in the legal profession to help defense attorneys collate data from social media.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that if you have sent him an email and he has not responded, it is because he did not have a chance to look or he briefly examined it in order to triage his messages.

\- He begins to address the internet sleuths, but then directs his comment to those who believe the defense worked with internet sleuths. He denies that they used sleuths to disseminate evidence to bypass the gag order.

\- He characterizes the web sleuths as a symbiotic relationship that he maintained because they provided some helpful information, and he was unable to give them any information due to the gag order.

\- Baldwin indicates that he is unsure if talking to certain individuals was a violation of the gag order in the case.

\- He insists that they should have fought the gag order, as it was too broad to be practical.

\- He speaks about the March 18, 2024 contempt hearing, where his team provided strong evidence that the State was leaking evidence.

\- He argues that LE and the Prosecution were only investigating the Defense because they wanted them off the case.

\- He contends that LE will not investigate accusations of misconduct in their own ranks even when solid evidence is presented showing unprofessional collaboration.

\- He claims to have seen emails from players on the State‚Äôs side and podcasters with instructions to erase everything because basically they have been found out.

\- He addresses Doug Carter directly to say that he can have his weird press conference ‚Äì which Baldwin has only seen bits and pieces of ‚Äì and say that he‚Äôd like to confront him, but Baldwin is unimpressed with him. He would be impressed by Doug Carter scrutinizing the evidence, asking solid questions, and investigating accusations of leaks by LE as vigilantly as they did the Defense crime scene photo leak.

\- Baldwin states that if journalists would interview subordinates of Holeman and Carter because he knows that those journalists would learn that those under their command are also unimpressed.

\- He claims that Holeman and Carter think that everybody worships them and thinks they‚Äôre awesome, but that there is a disconnect between how they are actually perceived by people who know them.

\- He says he will share an anecdote about Jerry Holeman to illustrate who he is as a person.

\- He stops, and directs a comment to Holeman that he would not be on DD were it not for the fact that Holeman is already out there on podcasts spreading his narrative.

\- He gives background information for context about the anecdote:

\- Baldwin instructed Allen during jury selection and for the trial that the jury will be watching him. He specifically warned him that when crime scene photos are being displayed, the jury will watch his reaction to them. Since the photos can be upsetting to anybody, he advised him that when the photos are up, view each of the four quadrants of the photo and make a list of items seen in the photo to shift focus away from whatever visceral reaction he has.

\- He also instructed Allen that during graphic testimony, to write down word-for-word what is being said to shift focus away from the emotion behind that testimony.

\- Baldwin returns to the anecdote, to explain that during the trial Jerry Holeman was seated directly next to Allen and was craning over to read his notes because he is a bully.

\- He points out that Holeman‚Äôs true character is the angry and verbally abusive man seen at the end of Allen‚Äôs 10/26/22 interview.

\- Defense investigator Matt Hoffman notices Holeman is reading Allen‚Äôs notes, points it out Baldwin, who asks Allen to lean back so that he can look directly at Holeman. Baldwin pointed at Holeman and instructed him to stop reading Allen‚Äôs notes.

\- He says that Holeman was shocked when confronted about reading the notes, since he is used to deferential treatment.

\- He relates that Holeman tried to speak to him during the next break, he stated that his vision is poor and he was not able to read anything Allen had written.

\- Baldwin told Holeman to get out of his face, and return to his seat.

\- Baldwin asserts that this confrontation is why Holeman does not like him, because he does not put up with his bullying.

\- He explains that he is not confrontational, and is otherwise a wimp, but he has no respect for Holeman and it is easy to be confrontational with him because of that.

\- Ali asks for Baldwin to tell about what Jerry Holeman and LE did to him personally, and also asks if the police harassed any defense witnesses or people named in the Franks memo.

\- He states that Jerry Holeman tried to have Baldwin arrested and charged with a crime.

\- Ali asks Baldwin to elaborate.

\- Baldwin says that the crime scene photo leak that happened was awful and terrible.

\- He states that when he became aware of it, he immediately reached out to the courts.

\- He says that the next day Holeman contacted him via phone, and informed him that he was assigned to investigate the leak.

\- Baldwin questioned why Holeman was investigating that allegation.

\- He claims that Holeman had open disdain for him because they were attacking his case, and that amounted to a conflict of interest.

\- He says that he told Holeman that he knew he was going to use this opportunity to have Baldwin kicked off the case.

  
\- Baldwin states that typically when he has to cooperate with a police investigation an officer comes to his office to collect a statement from him.

\- Baldwin felt that Holeman abused his authority to seize control of the investigation, rather than let the responsibility go to another State Police employee.

\- Holeman contacted the Johnson County Indiana Prosecutor - Lance Hamner - to request that charges be filed against Baldwin.

\- Baldwin speaks directly to Holeman and states that he is very well liked, and that he is well-respected, and that he would be surprised to know how well he is regarded.

\- Hamner‚Äôs secretary immediately reached out to ask Baldwin who Holeman is and ask what he is doing.

\- He states that Holeman was aware that Baldwin had not committed a crime.

\- He hints at a friend of his who committed wrongdoing, but Baldwin complains that he was the one treated as though he was a criminal.

\- He characterizes Holeman‚Äôs attempt to have him arrested as real ‚Äúthird world Banana Republic type stuff.‚Äù

\- Baldwin goes on to explain that there are three counties in Indiana where he is not well-regarded, and in all three that is because the Prosecutors in those counties let the police run all over them.

\- Additionally, when the police do anything bad - or are dishonest - or skirt the edges, those Prosecutors in those respective counties overlook it and blame the Defense.

\- He felt that because he did not tolerate the abuse of authority by the Prosecutors and police he was named Public Enemy Number One.

\- He speaks to Doug Carter, to inform him that ‚Äúyour guy tried to arrest me for nonexistent charges, and that‚Äôs the guy you promoted.

\- Baldwin indicates that he wanted to believe that Doug Carter had integrity and would look into his complaints, but he was instead directed to ISP‚Äôs Internal Affairs.

\- Baldwin met with Internal Affairs, who were cordial and interviewed him, and he never heard from anyone regarding his complaints again.

\- He says that Holeman did not allow local police to arrest Mitch Westerman. He personally came down to arrest Westerman, and brought every LE officer he could find to do so, which is uncharacteristic for a misdemeanor arrest.

\- He says that Holeman‚Äôs attempt to amplify his power is super scary, he‚Äôs nervous talking about it, and he doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthey‚Äù are going to do.

\- He has prayed about it, and concluded that he has to have the courage to talk candidly about his negative experiences.

\- Bob asks him to address rumors from pro-Prosecution commentators, that allege that the Defense purposefully leaked the crime scene photos in order to corroborate the Franks memo.

\- Baldwin characterizes this accusation as outrageous.

\- Baldwin‚Äôs staff watched all media interviews after the gag order was lifted, and saw Holeman offer the opinion that he believed the leak was deliberate.

\- Baldwin said there would have been no benefit to such a leak, it could potentially derail the whole case, and that on a human level he would never want that done.

\- He communicates that he finds the idea of the leak upsetting, that he has cried extensively about it.

\- He states that his friend Mitch made a tragic error.

\- He addresses a rumor that Mitch was working with the Prosecution, which he dismisses as untrue.

\- He explains that Mitch had a friend who believed in Allen‚Äôs guilt. He claims that Mitch took pictures of the crime scene photos in an attempt to convince his friend of Allen‚Äôs innocence, and that friend betrayed him.

\- He says he does not blame ‚Äúhim‚Äù for trusting his friend, but that this leak is Westerman‚Äôs fault.

\- Baldwin says that he was treated like a criminal, when in fact he was the victim, but he also is not sure a crime occurred so he‚Äôs not sure if that‚Äôs the appropriate way to classify his status.

\- He states that Westerman‚Äôs actions were wrong, ridiculous, infuriating, and super upsetting.

\- He relates that Westerman‚Äôs life is ruined in a lot of ways because of this incident.

\- Baldwin has forgiven Westerman, since he knows it was a devastating mistake on his part.

\- He knows that Westerman regrets it immensely, has lost his job, and alludes to other difficulties.

\- Baldwin explains that he was angry for a long time, but now he feels awful for Westerman as he has faced consequences for his actions.

\- He again denies that the leak was intentional, and denies any prior knowledge about the leak.

\- He said that it was despicable and defamatory for Doug Carter to say that Baldwin was in any way responsible for the suicide that occurred following the discovery of the leak.

That is NOT a Dog,nosleep,1hwy88f,2025-01-08 18:22:51,28,0.94,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hwy88f/that_is_not_a_dog/,sunshinesnooze,,"You can call me AW. I live in a small town in the northern part of Michigan in a small cabin in the woods. Living in the woods in a secluded area is tough and often leaves people feeling lonely. As a result, I decided to go to my local shelter and adopt a dog. I figured I lived in a secluded area with lots of land and forest for the dog to run around. I also worked, mostly, from home giving me the free time needed to take care of a dog.¬†

At the local shelter, I noticed nothing odd. It was the normal barks and whimpers of dogs, wagging their tails excitedly to leave their kennels. I‚Äôll be honest, I always hated going to Animal Shelters. Seeing all the animals, some cowering, and some begging to be let out always filled my heart with sorrow. I was sick of the loneliness though, and to be completely honest I am not the biggest people person. So a dog it was. I had always wanted a dog as a kid and loved every dog I was allowed to pet. My parents could never afford one and I never got around to getting one as an adult.¬†

I was most interested in getting a larger dog, one who would enjoy running around my land and perhaps even go on long walks with me. Most of the dogs just didn‚Äôt appeal to me until I came across a large scrawny black and white mutt. I‚Äôm not the greatest with dog breeds but I had guessed possibly border collie, greyhound, and perhaps a little bit of Pitbull. The shelter labeled the dog as a border collie mix. The dog had a longer snout, blockier head, long thin legs, and a leaner build. He had half-pricked ears, one slightly floppier than the other. His eyes were a icy shade of blue but one had brown mixed in. He was stunning. I knelt beside the cage and he wagged his tail and hesitantly got up and approached. His movements were‚Ä¶ off. It was like that of a creature not quite used to walking on four legs. Like a human trying to walk on four legs.¬†

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this guy?‚Äù I had asked the worker who had accompanied me into the kennel room.

‚ÄúOh him‚Ä¶‚Äù She had said, nervously, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a dog we recently took in, found by some stranger on the side of the street. No sign of a microchip and no one has taken him in. But‚Ä¶‚Äù The lady had trailed off, clearly uncertain whether to say something.

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù I had asked.

‚ÄúHe acts a little weird. Doesn‚Äôt play with the other dogs, heck the other dogs seem scared of him. Whenever he approaches even the friendliest dogs we have at the shelter he sends them running away barking and snarling, hackles raised, and trembling. He‚Äôs been returned five times in the month we have had him. All without notice. The owners always return looking nervous and never give us a clear answer.‚Äù The shelter worker stuttered out her reply. At that moment I felt bad for the poor boy. It wasn‚Äôt his fault but I guess I should‚Äôve heeded the warnings. I adopted him and took him home that day and things got weirder each day.¬†

On the way home, I took him to the local pet store, a small family-owned business, on a leash. Every dog that came across him lunged and barked, cowering behind their owners. Every dog no matter the breed or size. Even a guide dog I had frequently met when I went into town had lost it. That dog was the most stable ever, never barking or showing a speck of fear or aggression to anyone. It was odd but I just figured it was nothing. Perhaps the normal. I had never owned a dog before so I didn‚Äôt question it. I had, jokingly at the time, named him Cujo after the rabid St. Bernard in Cujo. Now I‚Äôm afraid that it isn‚Äôt a joke anymore.¬†

The first odd behavior I noticed was the way he seemed to stare deep into nothingness. I had taken him to the vet, concerned about some brain problem, but there was nothing. He was, as the vet said, healthy as a horse. I awoke some nights to him on top of the bed, his icy blue eyes staring deep into my soul. His eyes, some days, were too human-looking. They weren‚Äôt the normal eyes of a dog, even for the ones that have blue eyes.¬†

Everything went silent when we entered the woods together. Birds flew away, crickets stopped chirping, not a single snap of the twig in the distance, just complete dead silence. His eyes appeared to glow in the dark, a piercing blue through the dark of night.¬†

The experience that confirmed my theory was after a month of owning Cujo, the name had stuck. I awoke at night to a strange silence that had fallen across the house. I got up, my throat dry, to get a drink of water. The house was dead silent, not even the house settling was heard. My heart hammered in my chest as I headed for the kitchen. A *crunch, snap, crack* was heard from the direction of the kitchen.

‚ÄúCujo‚Ä¶?‚Äù I called out, hesitantly and the noises stopped. I entered the kitchen to see Cujo standing on his back legs, his arms positioned weirdly and the worst part about it, his head was turned around so he was staring at him. His back facing me but his head was swiveled around. His mouth was partially open, drool dripping from his mouth. I let out a scream and sprinted to my room.

The next morning when I crept out, Cujo came to me with a wagging tail, holding something in his mouth. He dropped it at my feet and I nearly gagged as the body of a dismembered squirrel landed at my feet, its intestines leaking from his body. I found many more of those that day of many different animals. Even a deer, he had somehow brought into the house. The smell of blood and decay was evident even after I scrubbed the house from head to toe. At that point, I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was terrified of him but I didn‚Äôt want to return him. What would I even tell them? Plus he wasn‚Äôt a bad companion outside of those incidents.¬†

The worst experience of all was when I awoke, facing the ceiling. I didn‚Äôt open my eyes right away but I felt something dripping onto my face. I groaned and wiped the liquid away. I opened my eyes and let out a scream. Cujo was on the ceiling, his jaw stretched out so wide it looked to be dislocated. He was perched on the ceiling, his body twisted in ways that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. His eyes were glowing not a faint glow but a full-blown glow that illuminated the whole room, a light blue glow. His teeth were sharper and his nails were gnarled claws, digging into the ceiling. Bits of plaster fell onto my face, I froze and couldn‚Äôt move. I was so terrified I was frozen out of fear. The creature above came to change, its face fading from one of a dog‚Äôs into one that is almost human, its fur and flesh fell away turning into the skin, hair sprouting from its head. The creature looked like me‚Ä¶ Except it was wrong. Some things weren‚Äôt right. Its eyes were slightly too close, nails a little too sharp, and nose the wrong shape. To the blind eye, it was me though. It took one of its bony arms and hit me as hard as he could.¬†

I awoke with chains connecting me to the wall. No matter how hard I tugged or shifted them I couldn‚Äôt figure out a way to unlock them. It was like the creature welded them to my legs, I could hardly even move.

I‚Äôm typing this out on the last of my phone battery. No one is picking up my calls and I‚Äôm afraid of what is to come. I came with a warning. There is someone out there pretending to be me. If you meet someone with long brown hair with green eyes that seem a little too close run. I am locked in a basement, chains welded to my legs. I fear I may die down here and that thing is going to take my place. I‚Äôm afraid it has already hurt people. If you adopt a dog from a local shelter and he displays any unusual behavior or appears wrong in any way return the dog, and get rid of it as soon as you can. That is not a dog."

We‚Äôre super good about grooming him and he isn‚Äôt like rolling in poop or anything. Idk, just a very alarming thing to happen so suddenly. Our nextdoor neighbors have 3 dogs, and they share a chain link fence with ours. Kind of wondering if this could‚Äôve been spread by one of them?

Since I go to school in a foreign country (I am an American citizen, raised in the US but I currently attend an international school abroad), I have to wait until I graduate in May to go through with enlisting since I have to get my diploma accredited to be equivalent to a US diploma. 
I was in the US recently for the holidays and spoke to recruiters from all the branches while I was there,
but as of right now I am leaning towards Army or Marines. 

The 3 MOS choices I have as of now are either 11B, 12B, or 14E. 
But out of both of those my main interest is in 14E because the job is interesting to me (air battles and air defense) and seems like it has a good transition into a civilian career in contracting

From what I‚Äôve gathered 14E seems to have a bad rep of being a bad MOS in terms of quality of life, but is this actually the case? 
In addition to this, I‚Äôve also heard 14 series (14E in particular) deploys often, how likely would I be deployed to Korea/Japan?

I‚Äôm a prior navy E-5 who worked in a tech role with the air wing onboard carriers‚Äîkind of like IT, but not exactly. I originally planned to cross over to the Army when I got out, but I ended up meeting someone and we know that story so things didn‚Äôt quite go as planned. Long story short, I‚Äôve been doing tech work ever since and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I'm missing something.

I‚Äôve already filed my VA claim and am at 60%, so I‚Äôm curious how that might impact joining the reserves. I‚Äôve been looking into Army Reserve options, specifically 11B or 12B. I know each branch tends to view the others through rose-colored glasses, so I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me keep it real about what to expect‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs worth pursuing or if I‚Äôm just a vet that misses the service.

Appreciate any advice for a squid.

Would enlisting as a 27D Paralegal Specialist in the Reserves --and-- completing law school help me at all in applying and *becoming* a JAG Officer? As far as networking and work experience goes.

I really want to be a JAG Officer in the United States Army; I understand it's a competitive process. Should I consider other processes to become a JAG Officer? I'm currently a school teacher with a bachelor's degree unrelated to law. American, if needed. Sorry if it's a redundant question.

Okay. I‚Äôm joining the military this year. Soon. I‚Äôm in the process as we speak, but I need help going down a path that will help me succeed and accomplish everything I‚Äôd like to go at. I want a job that can transfer over to the civilian sector but also do cool army stuff and field work as well. I want to actually feel like I‚Äôm in the army and train and become a warrior. Post army or while I‚Äôm in active duty, I‚Äôd like to fight rather its boxing or mma, as I‚Äôve been training for that for about 3 years now. I‚Äôm 25 and will probably be 26 when I head to boot camp. I will be enlisted as I have some college but no degree and I can‚Äôt afford it. I will be doing 4 active duty years. The reason I‚Äôm going is to be able to afford and propel my fighting career, secure a future for me and my future family if I get hurt while fighting, and to learn cool warrior shit. I was told 11b would not be the place for this because it doesn‚Äôt transfer over in the civilian sector and I understand. I don‚Äôt want to be wiping toilets majority of the time. I really wanted to go marines but I‚Äôm super tatted on hand and neck. I‚Äôm just wondering what anybody would do if they were me or what‚Äôs the best advice you can give.

Which MOS offer 3 Year Contracts? (3.5 years is okay)

I'm most interested in 35 series and 17C but I have been told that they're usually only offered as 4/5 year contracts. i'd also like to do option 4 or 40. My recruiter said i could do 35W with an option 40 3 year contract but Im skeptical because everyone i've talked to claims that any MOS that requires that much training is 5 years minimum

17C‚Äôs what‚Äôs the job actually like?

I‚Äôm looking into the Army and right now, I‚Äôm looking at 17C however my family doesn‚Äôt have too much military experience. The closest experience we have was some uncles who were in Vietnam. So with that, my mom is very worried and hesitant about signing off on me going to go do my physical exam before enlisting. And from what I have been told and know about 17C is that I‚Äôd most likely be stationed here in the U.S., it‚Äôs a pretty safe job and more so like an Office Job alongside the USAF people, And after getting out because of the TS clearance, I‚Äôd be getting job offers from places with ties to the DoD, 

So, people who are/were 17C‚Äôs what‚Äôs the job actually like? Do you recommend it? How civilian transferable is it? What are some things I should know before I join as a 17C? Would I likely be here in the US or would I be stationed abroad? and how can I try to ease my family‚Äôs concerns about joining the military? Anything else I should know?

18x 

I'm looking to enlist into the army. My overall goal is to become a Green Beret. I know I'm physically fit enough to join the army, I know I'm definitely not physically fit enough to successfully complete the physicall fitness test for an 18x contract. I'm wondering if there's a career path that would help accomplish the same goal or if I'd be better off waiting and trying to become physically fit enough myself.

Enlisting Monday but confused about contract 

Hello soldiers, after a long and grueling process with the waiver authority, I finally have the green light to enlist this Monday. Throughout this process, I expressed to my recruiter that I wanted to go 68W with airborne, which he really hyped up and was supportive of and affirmed that it‚Äôs definitely something that I can do. However, now I‚Äôm being told that 68W is over strength and that it won‚Äôt be available for some time. My recruiter gave me some other options to look over during the holidays but none of those seemed appealing to me at all. 

I feel like my recruiter is trying to pressure me into another mos that I‚Äôm not interested in and seemed annoyed at the fact that I‚Äôm standing my ground. Within one phone call, he went from saying that he can get me 68w but it will take a while, to suddenly locking in a ship date all the way in May 12th. After I explained all of this to one of buddies, he came up with the idea to call another recruiting station to ask if 68W was available. Unfortunately that other recruiter said it wasn‚Äôt available, but they also confirmed that there‚Äôs no way to lock in a date as far back as May, and that my recruiter is most likely bullshitting me. 

Here‚Äôs my question, when I go swear in on Monday, will my MOS be included in my contract or will they try and pressure me into accepting something different? Also, my recruiter mentioned that I can take a fitness test to enter in as an E2 but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it anymore. Does that need to be done prior to enlisting or can that be done afterwards?

Is joining the Army at 25 really a bad idea as everyone around me says it is?

I'm 25, living at home still, only jobs I ever worked was warehouse or other manual labor jobs. I'm not smart enough for college, so it was never an option for me. The only real opportunity I have is joining the UA Pipefitters union as my dad was really up there and I would get in even if I didn't know the math, but I never wanted to do that job. I did want to try to join the IBEW, but i'm losing interest in it. I'm tired of warehouse jobs, so that's another reason why i'm considering joining the army.

I went to see a recruiter today and everyone in my family was telling me how bad of an idea it is to join the army, especially because I can become a union pipefitter without the hassle. I guess I just want to leave my state and home, as my life has been really dull, no excitement at all and i'm getting tired of my home life. Part of my worry is that maybe joining would be a waste of time at the end, as maybe the job I choose won't help me land a job afterwards.

I know it depends on everything I do in life, but for people who joined later on in life, how did it work out for you? Any advice?

Questions pertaining to 35F

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm shipping out to BCT relatively soon. From what I‚Äôve read on various forums, this job is considered to be ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù if you get a FORSCOM assignment‚Äîis this true? Additionally, are assignments merit-based at all, or is it purely luck of the draw, with you being sent wherever they need you? I apologize if that‚Äôs an inherently stupid question. 

I have a strong desire to work in and around INSCOM and COCOM. Is there anything I can do (as an individual) to increase my chances of getting sent to work under one of these commands once I graduate from AIT?

Any other tips and advice related to 35F would also be greatly appreciated.

Summary For: Weekly Question Thread (12/30/2024 to 01/05/2025),ArmyWQT,1hvz0xk,2025-01-07 14:02:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyWQT/comments/1hvz0xk/summary_for_weekly_question_thread_12302024_to/,Army_Bot,,"I‚Äôm a senior in High School and planning to enlist after graduation. Since I go to school in a foreign country (I am an American citizen, raised in the US but I currently attend an international school abroad), I have to wait until I graduate in May to go through with enlisting since I have to get my diploma accredited to be equivalent to a US diploma. 
I was in the US recently for the holidays and spoke to recruiters from all the branches while I was there,
but as of right now I am leaning towards Army or Marines. 

The 3 MOS choices I have as of now are either 11B, 12B, or 14E. 
But out of both of those my main interest is in 14E because the job is interesting to me (air battles and air defense) and seems like it has a good transition into a civilian career in contracting

From what I‚Äôve gathered 14E seems to have a bad rep of being a bad MOS in terms of quality of life, but is this actually the case? 
In addition to this, I‚Äôve also heard 14 series (14E in particular) deploys often, how likely would I be deployed to Korea/Japan?

I‚Äôm a prior navy E-5 who worked in a tech role with the air wing onboard carriers‚Äîkind of like IT, but not exactly. I originally planned to cross over to the Army when I got out, but I ended up meeting someone and we know that story so things didn‚Äôt quite go as planned. Long story short, I‚Äôve been doing tech work ever since and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I'm missing something.

I‚Äôve already filed my VA claim and am at 60%, so I‚Äôm curious how that might impact joining the reserves. I‚Äôve been looking into Army Reserve options, specifically 11B or 12B. I know each branch tends to view the others through rose-colored glasses, so I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me keep it real about what to expect‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs worth pursuing or if I‚Äôm just a vet that misses the service.

Appreciate any advice for a squid.

Would enlisting as a 27D Paralegal Specialist in the Reserves --and-- completing law school help me at all in applying and *becoming* a JAG Officer? As far as networking and work experience goes.

I really want to be a JAG Officer in the United States Army; I understand it's a competitive process. Should I consider other processes to become a JAG Officer? I'm currently a school teacher with a bachelor's degree unrelated to law. American, if needed. Sorry if it's a redundant question.

Rank Question: In an invasion scenario (e.g. chinese paratroopers drop into NYC), does a SWAT officer have any authority over the lowest-ranking military privates or at least would the privates follow their lead in a SWAT-like scenario like clearing out a skyscraper? Are they considered the same rank? Or does the low ranking private by default outrank the SWAT officer despite whatever gear or experience the officer has?

Edit: If this is not the space to ask this question, can I be redirected to that place?

Okay. I‚Äôm joining the military this year. Soon. I‚Äôm in the process as we speak, but I need help going down a path that will help me succeed and accomplish everything I‚Äôd like to go at. I want a job that can transfer over to the civilian sector but also do cool army stuff and field work as well. I want to actually feel like I‚Äôm in the army and train and become a warrior. Post army or while I‚Äôm in active duty, I‚Äôd like to fight rather its boxing or mma, as I‚Äôve been training for that for about 3 years now. I‚Äôm 25 and will probably be 26 when I head to boot camp. I will be enlisted as I have some college but no degree and I can‚Äôt afford it. I will be doing 4 active duty years. The reason I‚Äôm going is to be able to afford and propel my fighting career, secure a future for me and my future family if I get hurt while fighting, and to learn cool warrior shit. I was told 11b would not be the place for this because it doesn‚Äôt transfer over in the civilian sector and I understand. I don‚Äôt want to be wiping toilets majority of the time. I really wanted to go marines but I‚Äôm super tatted on hand and neck. I‚Äôm just wondering what anybody would do if they were me or what‚Äôs the best advice you can give.

Which MOS offer 3 Year Contracts? (3.5 years is okay)

I'm most interested in 35 series and 17C but I have been told that they're usually only offered as 4/5 year contracts. i'd also like to do option 4 or 40. My recruiter said i could do 35W with an option 40 3 year contract but Im skeptical because everyone i've talked to claims that any MOS that requires that much training is 5 years minimum

17C‚Äôs what‚Äôs the job actually like?

I‚Äôm looking into the Army and right now, I‚Äôm looking at 17C however my family doesn‚Äôt have too much military experience. The closest experience we have was some uncles who were in Vietnam. So with that, my mom is very worried and hesitant about signing off on me going to go do my physical exam before enlisting. And from what I have been told and know about 17C is that I‚Äôd most likely be stationed here in the U.S., it‚Äôs a pretty safe job and more so like an Office Job alongside the USAF people, And after getting out because of the TS clearance, I‚Äôd be getting job offers from places with ties to the DoD, 

So, people who are/were 17C‚Äôs what‚Äôs the job actually like? Do you recommend it? How civilian transferable is it? What are some things I should know before I join as a 17C? Would I likely be here in the US or would I be stationed abroad? and how can I try to ease my family‚Äôs concerns about joining the military? Anything else I should know?

18x 

I'm looking to enlist into the army. My overall goal is to become a Green Beret. I know I'm physically fit enough to join the army, I know I'm definitely not physically fit enough to successfully complete the physicall fitness test for an 18x contract. I'm wondering if there's a career path that would help accomplish the same goal or if I'd be better off waiting and trying to become physically fit enough myself.

Enlisting Monday but confused about contract 

Hello soldiers, after a long and grueling process with the waiver authority, I finally have the green light to enlist this Monday. Throughout this process, I expressed to my recruiter that I wanted to go 68W with airborne, which he really hyped up and was supportive of and affirmed that it‚Äôs definitely something that I can do. However, now I‚Äôm being told that 68W is over strength and that it won‚Äôt be available for some time. My recruiter gave me some other options to look over during the holidays but none of those seemed appealing to me at all. 

I feel like my recruiter is trying to pressure me into another mos that I‚Äôm not interested in and seemed annoyed at the fact that I‚Äôm standing my ground. Within one phone call, he went from saying that he can get me 68w but it will take a while, to suddenly locking in a ship date all the way in May 12th. After I explained all of this to one of buddies, he came up with the idea to call another recruiting station to ask if 68W was available. Unfortunately that other recruiter said it wasn‚Äôt available, but they also confirmed that there‚Äôs no way to lock in a date as far back as May, and that my recruiter is most likely bullshitting me. 

Here‚Äôs my question, when I go swear in on Monday, will my MOS be included in my contract or will they try and pressure me into accepting something different? Also, my recruiter mentioned that I can take a fitness test to enter in as an E2 but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it anymore. Does that need to be done prior to enlisting or can that be done afterwards?

Is joining the Army at 25 really a bad idea as everyone around me says it is?

I'm 25, living at home still, only jobs I ever worked was warehouse or other manual labor jobs. I'm not smart enough for college, so it was never an option for me. The only real opportunity I have is joining the UA Pipefitters union as my dad was really up there and I would get in even if I didn't know the math, but I never wanted to do that job. I did want to try to join the IBEW, but i'm losing interest in it. I'm tired of warehouse jobs, so that's another reason why i'm considering joining the army.

I went to see a recruiter today and everyone in my family was telling me how bad of an idea it is to join the army, especially because I can become a union pipefitter without the hassle. I guess I just want to leave my state and home, as my life has been really dull, no excitement at all and i'm getting tired of my home life. Part of my worry is that maybe joining would be a waste of time at the end, as maybe the job I choose won't help me land a job afterwards.

I know it depends on everything I do in life, but for people who joined later on in life, how did it work out for you? Any advice?

Questions pertaining to 35F

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm shipping out to BCT relatively soon. From what I‚Äôve read on various forums, this job is considered to be ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù if you get a FORSCOM assignment‚Äîis this true? Additionally, are assignments merit-based at all, or is it purely luck of the draw, with you being sent wherever they need you? I apologize if that‚Äôs an inherently stupid question. 

I have a strong desire to work in and around INSCOM and COCOM. Is there anything I can do (as an individual) to increase my chances of getting sent to work under one of these commands once I graduate from AIT?

Any other tips and advice related to 35F would also be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!

Ramble about Pyro teammates in Burnmelt from a C6R5 player,WriothesleyMains,1htag8e,2025-01-04 03:57:19,49,0.92,10,https://v.redd.it/1q2a422syxae1,Euthymiac,Discussion,"Hi Reddit! I‚Äôve been a long-time Genshin player (1.1 Phase 2) and ever since he released, Wriothesley‚Äôs been my favourite character. With the release of 5.3 bringing some new options to his teams, I figured I wanted to just share some of my thoughts on them in a place with other people who care about this character as much as I do. I‚Äôm new to the app, so I hope this is the right thing to do! lol

In particular, I‚Äôll be talking about the Pyro unit used in Burnmelt, since that‚Äôs the team I‚Äôve mostly been playing ever since he released (well, technically I‚Äôve mostly been playing solo, but that‚Äôs a whole different can of worms) and it‚Äôs the team that got two new options this patch. I‚Äôm sure things change if you take the Dendro out of the equation, but I‚Äôm not as familiar.

Just a bit of background on me as a player, I C6R5ed Wrio on release day, and activated it all immediately, so I don‚Äôt have personal experience with any other level of investment. That said, I‚Äôd like to think I have pretty good understanding of the character, and I‚Äôm not an omegawhale, more of a dolphin/low spender (after Wrio, some of my biggest dps investments are C3R2 Raiden, C2R1 Yae and Kinich, and C1R1 Navia and Arle) so I‚Äôm playing with (mostly) relatable supports and the majority of my DPS are relatable as well. I just want to make it clear that even though my Wrio isn‚Äôt C6R5, this isn‚Äôt just a whale perspective, though I obviously have more to say about high investment Wrios.

As for the showcases attached, they‚Äôre more of a rotation example than anything else, with Wrio killing everything either in 1CA or just after. I did it on ASIMON since he‚Äôs honestly the best punching bag we have rn when it comes to not being annoying. (5 mil HP testing dummy when hoyo). It‚Äôs in order of the Pyro options I‚Äôm talking about from my favourite to least favourite, since apparently you can‚Äôt make them separate on this app (?). This is also the order I‚Äôll be discussing them in.

Going to talk about the example team first.

First and most importantly, Wrio. My Wrio is C6R5 4PC Mare (predictable) with ATK/ATK/CD mainstats. Thanks to all the DMG% from C1, C2 and R5, ATK% goblet pulls ahead, and in a team with Nahida and no Bennett, ATK% pulls ahead on the sands (I happen to have an EM sands with the nearly the same crit as my ATK sands, and optimiser still gives me the ATK sands). CD circlet is self-explanatory, even with C6.

Then, Xilonen. Personally, due to the ease of use from no circle impact, rare RES shred, and the ATK stacking from Wrio‚Äôs 2 mainstats, Cashflow R5, and A4, I‚Äôve chosen to use Xilonen over Benny since she came out. For lower investment Wrios who run Cryo gob (and potentially EM sands) I assume Bennett is a more appealing option (tho Xilonen is still good), which would change my opinions on the other Pyros (namely, I‚Äôd have a nicer opinion of Xiangling). Having to N1 at the rotation start to apply Cryo for Scroll is no big deal, and the Pyro aura is usually gone by the end of Wrio‚Äôs fieldtime for Xilonen to easily crystallise Cryo again. My Xilonen is on a simple C0 Fav Scroll build.

Nahida is my choice of Dendro. For lower investment Wrios, Emilie should be a better option, because she does significantly more personal damage than Nahida (and also helps with survivability slightly) however at my level of investment, Wrio‚Äôs personal damage is so significant compared to any SubDPS that just buffing up his EM with Nahida gives me better results. This is another example of where the team may change if we‚Äôre talking about a C0 Wrio, but Nahida is still viable. My Nahida is C2R1 (but neither of her cons have a noticeable impact on this team) with a build just stacking full EM. Technically you could run Tenacity, but I don‚Äôt have a set with enough EM to reach 1K.

Now, starting to talk about the Pyros, my new favourite (to nobody‚Äôs surprise) is Mavuika. I‚Äôve just pulled C0 with an R5 Serpent Spine, and she‚Äôs on a standard EM/Pyro/CD Codex build. She‚Äôs only L80 and can have her signature or higher talent levels to improve her damage, which I imagine would make her feel even better.

Mavuika has incredible ease of use for her minimum value, just needing to click E and switch. This is plenty of easy to apply Pyro and is all she needed to do to be my new favourite option, but she also has the benefit of having a chunky ult on her Q. In this team, thanks to Xilonen, she should have a fully stacked ult every rotation, though even in teams where she doesn‚Äôt, she should be able to get it from just her own Nightsoul, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the damage and A4 buff makes it still worth using. It can be a bit awkward to Melt her Ult, however, so I‚Äôve been switching onto Wrio to N1 twice for both Xilonen and Mavuika. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better rotation that only requires the starting N1 somewhere on this subreddit. In C0 Wrio teams, this damage alone is a significant portion of the total team damage, and even for my C6R5 Wrio, being able to frontload such a big nuke has been very helpful for clear times, as Wrio‚Äôs damage can be somewhat backloaded, having to B5 for his first CA and also having to stack his C2 before using ult as an emergency kill button. Though, as you‚Äôll see in the video showcase, Wrio actually got his rebuke early because he started at low HP, so he didn‚Äôt actually need to go to N5 there like I did.

Mavuika isn‚Äôt perfect though. To use her optimally, you wanna build her for big damage, which means you have to invest a lot of resin and get a good Codex set. She could use ToTM/Scroll/Instructor, but these all come with the opportunity cost of her damage, and in the case of Scroll, it has overlap with Xilonen (this can be partially resolved by something like Petra Xilonen though). In teams with Bennett instead of Xilonen, she gets to use Scroll freely, but I‚Äôm pretty sure her ult nuke will be weaker due to less ult stacks, and her A4 bonus will be less, cutting into Wrio‚Äôs damage (though this isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, since it isn‚Äôt a super big buff to begin with).

My biggest issue with Mavuika though is that she simply has stronger teams that don‚Äôt include C0 Wrio, especially if you have Citlali or Xilonen. While any team with my Wrio in it is always going to be the strongest team on my account, I can imagine for some people using Mavuika as a Wrio SubDPS is a bit of an opportunity cost. Despite that, it‚Äôs still a really strong team and more than capable of clearing, so I totally think it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôre dedicated to Wrio or there‚Äôs a Cryo-weak abyss. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Mavuika is the only one I‚Äôm talking about who‚Äôs a limited 5*, which obviously requires pulling her in gacha, making her less accessible than the other four.

Next up is PMC, who I‚Äôm using on Fav Instructor, and is currently C5 (kinda, you know what I mean). It‚Äôs important to note a big part of PMC‚Äôs value is their Scroll access, which isn‚Äôt really relevant with Xilonen on the team. Once again, you could run ToTM or something like Petra Xilonen, but I decided to use Instructor. In teams without Xilonen or teams where she isn‚Äôt on Scroll, PMC gains a significant amount more value than I show in the showcase.

PMC is easy to use, just E into Q. You need to build some ER (200+) but Fav‚Äôs hefty substat and the fact that their personal damage isn‚Äôt exactly spectacular means this isn‚Äôt too big of a deal. It also means that you don‚Äôt need to invest too much into their Talent levels and DPS substats, as all that does is increase their mediocre personal damage, which makes them cheaper to build- which is further helped by the fact you get a bunch of their stuff for free‚Ä¶ because they‚Äôre the main character. For similar reasons, this means investing in Pyro MC is also kinda futureproof if Cryo MC turns out to be good, and you also get gimmicky stuff like the extra Constellation tree against the Natlan Weekly Boss, though most of these are PMC self-buffs aside from the team healing (which totally should‚Äôve been basekit). PMC also has some very minor buffs in their C1 (6% damage bonus isn‚Äôt a lot) and they‚Äôre also completely free, with a free C6 (soon), which means they‚Äôre a guaranteed option every player will have.

The main downside of PMC is that they aren‚Äôt really anything special, they‚Äôre just offield Pyro and a support set. They‚Äôre easy to use, and Scroll is the strongest support set available, but they don‚Äôt have any of the unique utility or personal damage the other options have. I‚Äôm personally quite a big fan of them, and since they‚Äôre new I wanted to talk about them second, but they‚Äôre pretty much interchangeable with Thoma when talking about my second favourite.

Speaking of Thoma, he‚Äôs C6, also using Instructor, and on Fav. He‚Äôs on Instructor for similar reasons to PMC, but obviously doesn‚Äôt have Scroll or ToTM access. He could use Noblesse, I guess. He‚Äôs easy to play (just EQ, though I always QE from Kitain Cross Spear muscle memory lol). Thanks to the lack of Scroll, Thoma‚Äôs options for buffing Wrio‚Äôs damage aren‚Äôt as potent as PMC, but he comes with the major benefits of additional IR and small shielding. As a C6R5 player, with C1‚Äôs consistent Rebukes, C4‚Äôs extra healing, and all the extra ATK SPD to make attack chains more consistent, this feels unnecessary, but I can imagine it‚Äôs a lot more relevant for a C0 Wrio player. He‚Äôs also another cheaper resin investment, with his talent levels and personal stats only ever really contributing to his (already meh) Shield Strength, since his personal damage is basically nonexistent.

However, Thoma has a lot of utility locked behind constellations. Before C2, his burst duration is shorter, before C4, he has even worse energy issues, and before C6, he has no innate buffing in his kit. I struggle with energy sometimes even at C4 with Fav in a Bennettless team, and having no buffing with mediocre support set options means he‚Äôs less effective for overall team damage (ignoring the effective damage gained from not getting staggered or having to dodge, etc).

I‚Äôve never really used Thoma much because my Thoma is usually on a Burgeon build, and I hate moving my Artifacts and weapons around, because I always forget to change them back. However, he was Wrio‚Äôs best option before 5.3, and at C6 he‚Äôs probably still a C0 Wrio‚Äôs best budget option, though at C1+, you might start considering PMC more thanks to the more consistent healing and lower stamina use. Also, Thoma‚Äôs hot as hell, which is a real plus in my books.

Next up is Dehya, who for me is C0 (pulled on her banner, actually never lost a 50/50 to her) using Fav and ToTM. She‚Äôs easy to plug and play with decent uptime (better at C2), with Fav helping team energy and Sac allowing better repositioning at the cost of some rotation awkwardness, imo both are fine. Like Thoma, she gives the benefit of IR, but both her IR and Pyro are locked to a circle, and her IR is weak after her A1 super armour runs out. Also, while her HP redirection doesn‚Äôt prevent Wrio‚Äôs self-damage, so he‚Äôll still gain rebukes at the same rate, it isn‚Äôt as sturdy of protection as a shield when he‚Äôs potentially hovering around half HP.

Similar to PMC and Thoma, her poor personal damage means you don‚Äôt need to invest talent levels and good substats (outside of increasing her survivability niche or Fav proc chances), and unlike the other two, she doesn‚Äôt even need to build ER. In fact, technically, since she doesn‚Äôt need the ER or ATK, you could even leave her fav Greatsword at level 1 lol. She‚Äôs also a standard unit, so the chances of getting her eventually are high to inevitable, and you can even pick her at the anniversary selector if you don‚Äôt have her yet (though I suspect most of us will be picking the new standard unit they teased in the 5.0 stream). Despite this, aside from some uptime QOL in C2, her cons are only for her personal damage, and therefore aren‚Äôt really utilised in this team.

I‚Äôve been using Dehya as my pyro unit in Burnmelt because she‚Äôs easy to play and I don‚Äôt have to rebuild her for different teams, as she can always just hold onto ToTM and Fav. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs probably better than a C0 Thoma due to ease of use, but once you have Thoma‚Äôs C6 and he can provide a damage amp (of which Dehya has none) he pulls ahead.

Finally, I‚Äôm gonna talk about Xiangling. My Xiangling is C6 with Fav, and 4PC emblem on ER/PYRO/CR. It‚Äôs important to note the video showcase isn‚Äôt a true display of her performance- as a solo Pyro, she needs approximately 3 billion ER, and at that point, I‚Äôd sooner convince the enemy hilichurl shooter to fire a pyro arrow at the grass under the enemy‚Äôs feet to start burning instead. Despite that, if you can build enough ER, it‚Äôs easy to play, just pressing EQ, and her Pyro app is incredibly high and follows you, basically guaranteeing an aura, which is very nice. Unlike the last three, her personal damage is decent (though it is neutered without Bennett) and combined with her ER needs, it means you can build a crit-based 4 Emblem pretty easily and get some okay damage out of her (though you will need to level her ult). However, in exchange for this personal damage, she has basically no utility, with no survivability and a very finicky and small ATK buff from her pepper that honestly isn‚Äôt worth actively picking up. 

Xiangling is free, which is a huge benefit, because it means that everyone has a copy. She also isn‚Äôt that reliant on her constellations- her C4 is super nice, giving her much better uptime, but aside from that, everything else is either non-functional in this team to a minor personal damage increase. She‚Äôs also a very strong unit, even if she isn‚Äôt the greatest in this team, so you‚Äôll want to build her eventually. Overall, Xiangling isn‚Äôt bad, but the ER isn‚Äôt a fun time and the others just give their own benefits to tackling Wrio‚Äôs unique issues. If Bennett is in the team, which may be the case in lower investment Wrio teams, she becomes significantly better, dealing less damage and needing less ER, though at that point, you may just abandon Burnmelt entirely and run a buffer in the Dendro‚Äôs spot, as Xiangling can pretty comfortably enable that.

Also, they‚Äôre not real options but I wanted to mention it, Yanfei/Klee (especially Klee C2) with TTDS and Amber with Elegy are nice for nuke showcases.

In conclusion, now that 5.3 is out, Mavuika‚Äôs quickly become my favourite option for Wrio‚Äôs Burnmelt teams, and I think PMC is a promising option too, especially for players without Xilonen and/or a C1+ Wrio. Thoma remains as good as ever, and Dehya and Xiangling are both usable options if you need them. Personally, I‚Äôm looking forward to Ifa (and hoping he‚Äôs Pyro) before maybe committing to more Mavuika copies/her signature on her rerun. I‚Äôd love to pair Wrio up with  a tall, handsome vet, but if not, I‚Äôm more than satisfied with the Pyro Archon! Thanks for reading this far (if you made it) and for listening to my rambles, lol.

Cryptocurrency for visual thinkers (shadow of yggdrasil) ,CryptoCurrency,1hs2zqv,2025-01-02 15:05:59,0,0.4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hs2zqv/cryptocurrency_for_visual_thinkers_shadow_of/,BenjiiXDraco117,ANALYSIS,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîthe networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future‚Äîa mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces‚Äîdevelopers, ideas, innovations‚Äîthat break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the ‚Äúcanopy‚Äù near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree‚Äôs full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk‚Äôs purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree‚Äôs eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree‚Äôs leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest‚Äôs conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree‚Äôs bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed‚Äîonly the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you‚Äôve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem‚Äôs Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies‚Äîlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîassets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn‚Äôt compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds‚Äîset clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they‚Äôre too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they‚Äôve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other‚Äôs innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree‚Äîtending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments‚Äîprojects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix‚Äîwith good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects‚Äîperhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn‚Äôt a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project‚Äôs stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin‚Äôs status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""‚Äîthey are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It‚Äôs still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let‚Äôs explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree‚Äôs branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree‚Äôs weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree‚Äôs health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here‚Äôs how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI‚Äôs computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree‚Äôs Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

governments involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree‚Äôs resilience‚Äîits ability to regenerate and evolve."

Prior Service Enlisted Leaving for Boot Camp June 2025. Will my Pay be screwed up?

I am going in for 35T. I had 4 years active duty and about 2 years traditional Air National Guard? Are there any prior service folks or finance troops that know what I can expect pay wise? I know going back enlisted won't be too special, but it would really suck if my prior time doesn't get added to my pay.

One would think if they give us a packing list it would be obvious to buy the things on it, however I‚Äôm trying to clarify because I‚Äôve seen multiple people on various social media outlets recounting their experience snd saying that the things they‚Äôd bought (off of the packing list) were taken away and disposed of. I‚Äôm a woman, so obviously at the very least I‚Äôd like to buy my hygiene products.

If anyone could give me insight on this, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!

25B Duty Station

Good afternoon. I am shipping out in a couple months, my MOS is 25B. I‚Äôm told that I will be able to compile a list of *preferred* duty stations for my first PCS. I‚Äôm looking for a duty station in which I‚Äôll actually be doing *25B* stuff, while being around other like-minded individuals. Would love to gain some insight from the Cyber umbrella of IT, as I do plan on transitioning or re-classing into 17C or 25D at some point in my army career. I am coming in as an E-4. I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree and master‚Äôs degree in fields completely unrelated to IT or Cyber. I do plan on obtaining another master‚Äôs degree (Cyber Security) while in the army. What duty stations should I be looking at for career advancement as an IT/Cyber professional. Pros and Cons of specific duty stations??? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I just enlisted in the Army reserves last Thursday. It was a long journey as I needed a medical, moral and dependent waiver. I'm 34, have a wife and 6 kids, have a masters degree and am an engineer for my day job. I was very happy to get 12B for my MOS as it is the only ""combat"" MOS in the reserves. My ship date is Jan. 7th to Fort Leonard Word. I am very excited and happy I got this far. I am looking for any advice anyone can give to me for my initial training. I do have some things specifically as well, like how's OSUT at Fort Leonard Wood during winter? Is it easy for mt to get my military paystub emailed to my employer so that I can receive my salary minus military pay for military leave? Should I just leave all my bills on autopay or is it possible to pay bills at training? Since I don't know what I don't know, any advice on anything is helpful. I appreciate the help in advance.

I'm 27 (F) in the barracks. People are always loud at night, leave messes in the hallways, etc. I'm done sharing a space with 18-22 year old men.

I'm wondering how can I possibly get CNA? I've talked to my leadership about it, and they're mostly on board with helping me apply for it. But I want to make sure I have the highest chance for it to be accepted.

No, I will not get married for BAH. My credit score is excellent, I've had a few different loans I've paid off and am currently paying off (car atm). I've lived a whole life before the army. 

If it doesn't get accepted, then I'll just have to wait till I hit E6. There's no harm in trying though.

Hi, I'm currently in the process of joining the army, I have a bachelor's degree and want to join as an officer. I did my asvab a few weeks ago and I'm about to do medical next week. If all goes well with my medical my recruiter wants me to sign a contract after medical. My first question is should I sign a contract or wait until I do the army officer interview and get approved first?

My second question is about the job that I want in the army. I have a degree in computer science and I'm interested in 17A, 17D or 170D. My question is which of these jobs is the best for getting a government job in IT or software development once I am out of the army or while I am in the reserves. This is the main reason that I am joining the army and I want to pick the job that has the most opportunity outside of the army.

Age 22, bachelor‚Äôs degree nonrelated to LE. Career Goal is a Police Officer, but currently no experience.

Looked into the Army and have interest in becoming a MP, but unsure of how long I would have to remain active to receive benefits for my fianc√©e and I and allow her to still pursue her education, and if Police Academy afterward would be out of pocket or not, we are very low income. 

Looking for thoughts and tips on the best course of action.

Are the prior service business rules still a thing?? I‚Äôm currently a E5 15T reservist looking to go back active. I would like to stay a 15T but the only prior service business rules I find do not include 15T but I keep hearing rumors of lots of 15series reservists going back active and retaining mos. How does this work?

SHOULD I LEAVE SCHOOL AND GO ACTIVE DUTY???  I have 78 out of my 140 credits to graduate, should I just go active duty now and do some online and finish when I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm thinking of doing the 3+5 contract and using the benefits to pay for the remainder of my degree or grad school. I‚Äôm more of a hands on person. I probably need the many weeks of AIT. Should I leave school, do my 3, then come back and finish. I‚Äôm only 20. What should I do

Ait for 35T is like 32 weeks long, as a reclass would it be considered a family pcs, or would i live in prior service barracks? Is 35T a much better choice than 25B? What is otempo army life like for these mos'? My buddy just got medboarded as a 35T and he said the certs plus his secret clearance got him a more than decent job with dod.

Recently made weight to join Army spoke with recruiter today. I am 28 years old with two kids and I‚Äôve been engaged for two years still not married. He advised me to ‚Äúbegin process as single‚Äù and present him with a marriage certificate before basic that way I will still get all the benefits of being married and not have to wait to begin the enlistment process. My question is, will this affect my ability to bring my family with me? Should I not ‚Äúbegin process‚Äù as single? I‚Äôm going in to take the asvap pre test tomorrow.

Hello! I‚Äôm joining as a 17E (Electromagnetic Warfare Specialist) leaving in May and wondering about the additional schools like Airborne, Air Assault, and Ranger school! As far as I have seen online I can‚Äôt find any additional schools/programs like these, and was wondering:

Are there are more I‚Äôm unaware of? My recruiter only mentioned airborne and ranger school to start and I found air assault, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôm missing one to find out more information on it. 

And is a 17E eligible to go to all of these schools? I‚Äôd really like to do at least one of them, but I can‚Äôt figure out if my MOS is one that can participate in all of them? I do know I can go to airborne school though! 

Lastly, my recruiter was confusing with it and told me I could ‚Äúdrop a packet as soon as basic training‚Äù if they had available seats for it, but I don‚Äôt really understand what that means? Is that after basic training ends I apply for it? Or is it before basic training? And what exactly is a packet?

Thanks!

Just completed my Associates in Networking/Cybersecurity this month. Most if not ALL entry levels require atleast 2 years of it experience (I don‚Äôt have it job related experience) so I figured joining the army as a 17C MOS to gain 6 years of experience while also gaining Certifications, then after my contract go to the civilian industry to then apply for good paying IT jobs. Anyone in the 17C than give some tips or if this route is a good idea?

Hey everyone I hope I‚Äôm posting this in the right section. Here‚Äôs my situation, I‚Äôm 28 have a bachelors in political science I want to go to law school someday and recently pursued getting a second degree in legal studies (I‚Äôm 4 classes from finishing) so I could work as a paralegal. I‚Äôve always wanted to join the military but didn‚Äôt know when or where (what branch) my sister is a marine vet now.  
  
Back in October I got into contact with my local recruiting office and started the enlistment process. I went to MEP‚Äôs a couple month ago passed my physical and medial (1‚Äôs)?, scored decent on the ASVAB(73).  
  
  
Had the intention of pursing the paralegal MOS. Here‚Äôs my dilemma, I got a DUI in 2022. Since then I‚Äôve paid my fees and even got out of informal probation early because I‚Äôm joining the military or hope to. My recruiters been working on my waiver, I just finished my school semester, and the only thing I‚Äôm waiting for is to complete my first offenders DUI program (expected to finish mid January).  
  
After MEPS I was told I‚Äôm not eligible for the paralegal MOS because of my DUI. I still want to join, but it seems going in the officer route is almost impossible with my criminal history which I‚Äôve kind of accepted. I‚Äôm looking into geospatial engineering any advice? What are the odds I could have a chance to be stationed in Germany? My recruiter tells me he‚Äôs very hard working and just sent two guys to Italy? But I mean..  
  
Like I said I‚Äôm still very interested in joining to be a part of something bigger. I feel like I‚Äôm closing in on enlisting and still don‚Äôt know about the enlisting options (19,20)? Anything I should ask about or look out for?  
  
Any advice would be great. Thank you

My cousin and I have been wanting to go SO for years, and now that we're set to graduate high school soon I need to decide what SOF unit I want to attempt. He's very sure of his decision to go SEAL, but my interests are elsewhere. I considered PJ for the longest time, but I don't know much about them other than what you find on the Air Force website. Then I started considering 18D because I like the thought of being medically qualified. I think it's a great skillset to have, military or not.

Can anyone shed some light on what training may overlap between 18D and PJ and what may not?

# Info on 35L

I‚Äôve been looking into information on 35L but most stuff online is either super broad or outdated. I had a few questions on:

\-Just over general description of what the day to day tasks and quality of life as an active duty 35L.

\-Where to expect first duty stations and role fresh out of AIT.

\-Deployment frequency, duties/role during deployment, and will these deployments be combat based or serve more of an intelligence role. And where at?

\-Also just overall outlook and perception on 35L, life in the army, career potential, job prospects, etc.

I‚Äôm aware most of these can be answered by what unit type you go to and the army‚Äôs needs, it‚Äôs just all information I‚Äôve seen is so broad and generalized, I‚Äôm looking for a little more clarity and detail of what 35Ls actually do and are.

Thanks in advance.

Prior Service Enlisted Leaving for Boot Camp June 2025. Will my Pay be screwed up?

I am going in for 35T. I had 4 years active duty and about 2 years traditional Air National Guard? Are there any prior service folks or finance troops that know what I can expect pay wise? I know going back enlisted won't be too special, but it would really suck if my prior time doesn't get added to my pay.

 Hello! I will be shipping out to Ft Jackson in February and was wondering should I go ahead and buy the things on the packing list?

One would think if they give us a packing list it would be obvious to buy the things on it, however I‚Äôm trying to clarify because I‚Äôve seen multiple people on various social media outlets recounting their experience snd saying that the things they‚Äôd bought (off of the packing list) were taken away and disposed of.

If anyone could give me insight on this, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!

25B Duty Station

Good afternoon. I am shipping out in a couple months, my MOS is 25B. I‚Äôm told that I will be able to compile a list of *preferred* duty stations for my first PCS. I‚Äôm looking for a duty station in which I‚Äôll actually be doing *25B* stuff, while being around other like-minded individuals. Would love to gain some insight from the Cyber umbrella of IT, as I do plan on transitioning or re-classing into 17C or 25D at some point in my army career. I am coming in as an E-4. I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree and master‚Äôs degree in fields completely unrelated to IT or Cyber. I do plan on obtaining another master‚Äôs degree (Cyber Security) while in the army. What duty stations should I be looking at for career advancement as an IT/Cyber professional. Pros and Cons of specific duty stations??? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I just enlisted in the Army reserves last Thursday. It was a long journey as I needed a medical, moral and dependent waiver. I'm 34, have a wife and 6 kids, have a masters degree and am an engineer for my day job. I was very happy to get 12B for my MOS as it is the only ""combat"" MOS in the reserves. My ship date is Jan. 7th to Fort Leonard Word. I am very excited and happy I got this far. I am looking for any advice anyone can give to me for my initial training. I do have some things specifically as well, like how's OSUT at Fort Leonard Wood during winter? Is it easy for mt to get my military paystub emailed to my employer so that I can receive my salary minus military pay for military leave? Should I just leave all my bills on autopay or is it possible to pay bills at training? Since I don't know what I don't know, any advice on anything is helpful. I appreciate the help in advance.

I have heard that only certain ranks are able to have their wife live with them, and I've heard some say that it doesn't matter.

Hello! I did 4 years of AJROTC all through high school and was told during my time that if I enlisted I would immediately receive a promotion and would receive a permanent 400$ increase on my monthly pay.

2. If so, how would I provide proof of my time in AJROTC.¬†
3. Is there a time limit on receiving these benefits? I have been out of high school for 4 years and if/when I‚Äôd enlist I‚Äôd be looking at 5-6 years. Would I still be eligible to receive these benefits?

My company was hounding us for around 2 months now about booking HBL tickets and whatnot, so after confirming multiple times with my drills sergeants that international travel is ok, I booked non refundable tickets for over $700 and let my family know that I'm coming home for the holidays. Now suddenly 8 days away from HBL brigade comes down and says no international travel allowed, zero exceptions. One of my drills unofficially told me to ignore it and go anyway, but im worried that undisclosed intl travel might fuck up my security clearance. Any advice on what I can do?

I'm 27 (F) in the barracks. People are always loud at night, leave messes in the hallways, etc. I'm done sharing a space with 18-22 year old men.

I'm wondering how can I possibly get CNA? I've talked to my leadership about it, and they're mostly on board with helping me apply for it. But I want to make sure I have the highest chance for it to be accepted.

No, I will not get married for BAH. My credit score is excellent, I've had a few different loans I've paid off and am currently paying off (car atm). I've lived a whole life before the army. 

If it doesn't get accepted, then I'll just have to wait till I hit E6. There's no harm in trying though.

Marine to Army Warrant Officer question (not the pilot
one)

Mos: 0241 Imagery Analyst


Can I become a warrant officer for the Army if my mos is the
same in the army. If not, will I be able to join the army a 2 or 3
years down the line become one. I know the Marine Corps has
warrant officers, but I want more opportunities to do things and
places to go. Also want slightly less Marine Corps shenanigans.

Should I go active duty army?

I am a junior in college (74 credits, 40 more to go) and almost done. Was thinking about doing NG but I like the benefits of Active duty. My recruiter told me I could get a lot of my credits doing AIT. Is this true? Should I leave school and go active duty. I also wanna be more hands on and an army active duty recruiter told me Enlisted soldiers are hands on and Officers are not. What is you guy‚Äôs opinion? I wanna do something mechanical or electrical

Two days ago I signed a six-year contract for the 35T MOS (Military Intelligence Systems Maintainer-Integrator) after discovering there were no available training slots remaining for the fiscal year for the 17C MOS (Cyber Operations Specialist.) I am looking for as much information about the 35T role and how I can maximize my future by taking advantage of all opportunities available. I will leave May 19th to Fort Sill, and then for my AIT in Arizona afterwards. I will be seeing in a reserve capacity, starting as an E3 with referrals. My recruiter will assist me with making connections and finding a job after I finish AIT. Many thanks!

Hi, I'm currently in the process of joining the army, I have a bachelor's degree and want to join as an officer. I did my asvab a few weeks ago and I'm about to do medical next week. If all goes well with my medical my recruiter wants me to sign a contract after medical. My first question is should I sign a contract or wait until I do the army officer interview and get approved first?

My second question is about the job that I want in the army. I have a degree in computer science and I'm interested in 17A, 17D or 170D. My question is which of these jobs is the best for getting a government job in IT or software development once I am out of the army or while I am in the reserves. This is the main reason that I am joining the army and I want to pick the job that has the most opportunity outside of the army.

Age 22, bachelor‚Äôs degree nonrelated to LE. Career Goal is a Police Officer, but currently no experience.

Looked into the Army and have interest in becoming a MP, but unsure of how long I would have to remain active to receive benefits for my fianc√©e and I and allow her to still pursue her education, and if Police Academy afterward would be out of pocket or not, we are very low income. 

Looking for thoughts and tips on the best course of action.

Are the prior service business rules still a thing?? I‚Äôm currently a E5 15T reservist looking to go back active. I would like to stay a 15T but the only prior service business rules I find do not include 15T but I keep hearing rumors of lots of 15series reservists going back active and retaining mos. How does this work?

SHOULD I LEAVE SCHOOL AND GO ACTIVE DUTY???  I have 78 out of my 140 credits to graduate, should I just go active duty now and do some online and finish when I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm thinking of doing the 3+5 contract and using the benefits to pay for the remainder of my degree or grad school. I‚Äôm more of a hands on person. I probably need the many weeks of AIT. Should I leave school, do my 3, then come back and finish. I‚Äôm only 20. What should I do

Recently made weight to join Army spoke with recruiter today. I am 28 years old with two kids and I‚Äôve been engaged for two years still not married. He advised me to ‚Äúbegin process as single‚Äù and present him with a marriage certificate before basic that way I will still get all the benefits of being married and not have to wait to begin the enlistment process. My question is, will this affect my ability to bring my family with me? Should I not ‚Äúbegin process‚Äù as single? I‚Äôm going in to take the asvap pre test tomorrow.

Hello! I‚Äôm joining as a 17E (Electromagnetic Warfare Specialist) leaving in May and wondering about the additional schools like Airborne, Air Assault, and Ranger school! As far as I have seen online I can‚Äôt find any additional schools/programs like these, and was wondering:

Are there are more I‚Äôm unaware of? My recruiter only mentioned airborne and ranger school to start and I found air assault, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôm missing one to find out more information on it. 

And is a 17E eligible to go to all of these schools? I‚Äôd really like to do at least one of them, but I can‚Äôt figure out if my MOS is one that can participate in all of them? I do know I can go to airborne school though! 

Lastly, my recruiter was confusing with it and told me I could ‚Äúdrop a packet as soon as basic training‚Äù if they had available seats for it, but I don‚Äôt really understand what that means? Is that after basic training ends I apply for it? Or is it before basic training? And what exactly is a packet?

Thanks!

Just completed my Associates in Networking/Cybersecurity this month. Most if not ALL entry levels require atleast 2 years of it experience (I don‚Äôt have it job related experience) so I figured joining the army as a 17C MOS to gain 6 years of experience while also gaining Certifications, then after my contract go to the civilian industry to then apply for good paying IT jobs. Anyone in the 17C than give some tips or if this route is a good idea?

Hey everyone I hope I‚Äôm posting this in the right section. Here‚Äôs my situation, I‚Äôm 28 have a bachelors in political science I want to go to law school someday and recently pursued getting a second degree in legal studies (I‚Äôm 4 classes from finishing) so I could work as a paralegal. I‚Äôve always wanted to join the military but didn‚Äôt know when or where (what branch) my sister is a marine vet now.  
  
Back in October I got into contact with my local recruiting office and started the enlistment process. I went to MEP‚Äôs a couple month ago passed my physical and medial (1‚Äôs)?, scored decent on the ASVAB(73).  
  
  
Had the intention of pursing the paralegal MOS. Here‚Äôs my dilemma, I got a DUI in 2022. Since then I‚Äôve paid my fees and even got out of informal probation early because I‚Äôm joining the military or hope to. My recruiters been working on my waiver, I just finished my school semester, and the only thing I‚Äôm waiting for is to complete my first offenders DUI program (expected to finish mid January).  
  
After MEPS I was told I‚Äôm not eligible for the paralegal MOS because of my DUI. I still want to join, but it seems going in the officer route is almost impossible with my criminal history which I‚Äôve kind of accepted. I‚Äôm looking into geospatial engineering any advice? What are the odds I could have a chance to be stationed in Germany? My recruiter tells me he‚Äôs very hard working and just sent two guys to Italy? But I mean..  
  
Like I said I‚Äôm still very interested in joining to be a part of something bigger. I feel like I‚Äôm closing in on enlisting and still don‚Äôt know about the enlisting options (19,20)? Anything I should ask about or look out for?  
  
Any advice would be great. Thank you

My cousin and I have been wanting to go SO for years, and now that we're set to graduate high school soon I need to decide what SOF unit I want to attempt. He's very sure of his decision to go SEAL, but my interests are elsewhere. I considered PJ for the longest time, but I don't know much about them other than what you find on the Air Force website. Then I started considering 18D because I like the thought of being medically qualified. I think it's a great skillset to have, military or not.

Can anyone shed some light on what training may overlap between 18D and PJ and what may not?

# Info on 35L

I‚Äôve been looking into information on 35L but most stuff online is either super broad or outdated. I had a few questions on:

\-Just over general description of what the day to day tasks and quality of life as an active duty 35L.

\-Where to expect first duty stations and role fresh out of AIT.

\-Deployment frequency, duties/role during deployment, and will these deployments be combat based or serve more of an intelligence role. And where at?

\-Also just overall outlook and perception on 35L, life in the army, career potential, job prospects, etc.

I‚Äôm aware most of these can be answered by what unit type you go to and the army‚Äôs needs, it‚Äôs just all information I‚Äôve seen is so broad and generalized, I‚Äôm looking for a little more clarity and detail of what 35Ls actually do and are.

Thanks in advance.

Analyst highlights 4 cryptocurrencies in the top 100 with a price below 0.10 USD to invest in,CapitalistExploits,1hp40n3,2024-12-29 14:45:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hp40n3/analyst_highlights_4_cryptocurrencies_in_the_top/,kayakero,,"With Bitcoin (BTC) turning heads with 140% growth this year, investors are looking for cryptocurrencies with low costs and high return potential.

In this context, a Finbold analyst has highlighted four promising cryptocurrencies with prices below $0.10 for those who want to start 2025 with good investment opportunities.

Although these cryptocurrencies present positive indicators, short-term fluctuations are common. Investors should conduct detailed research and align their strategies with their financial goals. Opportunities exist, but diversification and planning are key to success.

# Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Initially only seen as a memecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has evolved into a highly-interested asset. The introduction of Shibarium, its layer-2 blockchain, marked a milestone by improving scalability and transaction efficiency. Since its launch, the platform has recorded over 700 million transactions.

Currently, the SHIB meme cryptocurrency is trading at $0.000022, with 55% of its holders in profit. Moreover, movements by large investors (whales) reinforce its short-term appeal.

Plans to launch a stablecoin and the TREAT token as a reward expand the possibilities within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

The shadow of yggdrasil as the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape,ChatGPT,1hmt5eu,2024-12-26 12:25:35,0,0.2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hmt5eu/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil_as_the_evolution_of_the/,BenjiiXDraco117,Prompt engineering ,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîthe networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future‚Äîa mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces‚Äîdevelopers, ideas, innovations‚Äîthat break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the ‚Äúcanopy‚Äù near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree‚Äôs full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk‚Äôs purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree‚Äôs eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree‚Äôs leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest‚Äôs conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree‚Äôs bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed‚Äîonly the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you‚Äôve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem‚Äôs Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies‚Äîlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîassets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn‚Äôt compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds‚Äîset clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they‚Äôre too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they‚Äôve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other‚Äôs innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree‚Äîtending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments‚Äîprojects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix‚Äîwith good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects‚Äîperhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn‚Äôt a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project‚Äôs stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin‚Äôs status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""‚Äîthey are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It‚Äôs still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let‚Äôs explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree‚Äôs branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree‚Äôs weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree‚Äôs health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here‚Äôs how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI‚Äôs computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree‚Äôs Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree‚Äôs resilience‚Äîits ability to regenerate and evolve."
The shadow of yggdrasil as the evolving cryptocurrency landscape,chaosmagick,1hmt4q1,2024-12-26 12:24:41,0,0.13,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/chaosmagick/comments/1hmt4q1/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil_as_the_evolving/,BenjiiXDraco117,,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve into the deep future. Strategies and warnings based on my own strategy.


The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîthe networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future‚Äîa mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces‚Äîdevelopers, ideas, innovations‚Äîthat break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the ‚Äúcanopy‚Äù near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree‚Äôs full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk‚Äôs purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree‚Äôs eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.





---

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree‚Äôs leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest‚Äôs conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree‚Äôs bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed‚Äîonly the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you‚Äôve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem‚Äôs Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies‚Äîlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîassets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn‚Äôt compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds‚Äîset clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they‚Äôre too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they‚Äôve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other‚Äôs innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree‚Äîtending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments‚Äîprojects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix‚Äîwith good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects‚Äîperhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn‚Äôt a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project‚Äôs stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin‚Äôs status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""‚Äîthey are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It‚Äôs still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let‚Äôs explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree‚Äôs branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree‚Äôs weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree‚Äôs health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here‚Äôs how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI‚Äôs computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree‚Äôs Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree‚Äôs resilience‚Äîits ability to regenerate and evolve."
The shadow of yggdrasil,CryptoCurrency,1hmrynl,2024-12-26 11:32:04,0,0.27,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hmrynl/the_shadow_of_yggdrasil/,BenjiiXDraco117,ANALYSIS,"Based on a vision i had after microdosing, i've come to beleive that cryptocurrencies are a naturally arising counter to the world tree of Norse mythology, Yggdrasil. The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîthe networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future‚Äîa mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces‚Äîdevelopers, ideas, innovations‚Äîthat break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the ‚Äúcanopy‚Äù near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree‚Äôs full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk‚Äôs purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree‚Äôs eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""





---

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree‚Äôs leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest‚Äôs conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree‚Äôs bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed‚Äîonly the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you‚Äôve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem‚Äôs Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies‚Äîlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem‚Äîassets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn‚Äôt compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds‚Äîset clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they‚Äôre too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they‚Äôve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other‚Äôs innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree‚Äîtending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments‚Äîprojects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix‚Äîwith good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects‚Äîperhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn‚Äôt a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project‚Äôs stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin‚Äôs status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""‚Äîthey are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It‚Äôs still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let‚Äôs explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree‚Äôs branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree‚Äôs weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree‚Äôs health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here‚Äôs how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI‚Äôs computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree‚Äôs Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

Your observation about governments attempting to wrest control is a significant one. Their involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree‚Äôs resilience‚Äîits ability to regenerate and evolve."

Why Honda and Toyota Cars Are My Favorite‚ÄîDespite My 20-Year Tenure at Magna International,MiltonMarketing,1hm3hcw,2024-12-25 11:13:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiltonMarketing/comments/1hm3hcw/why_honda_and_toyota_cars_are_my_favoritedespite/,da-birdman-101,,"I‚Äôve spent two decades working within one of the most influential automotive suppliers in the world:¬†[**Magna International**](https://miltonmarketing.com/news/why-honda-and-toyota-cars-are-my-favorite-despite-my-20-year-tenure-at-magna-international/#).

But no matter how intertwined my professional life was with Magna International, my personal loyalties in the automotive world always lay with¬†**Honda**¬†and¬†**Toyota**. This might seem paradoxical, but I believe my experiences grant me a unique vantage point to articulate exactly why these two Japanese brands have earned my lifelong respect‚Äîwhile Magna International, despite being a powerful player, often missed the mark in terms of true quality, long-term performance, and ethical standards.

# My Early Days at Magna International

I can still recall the excitement I felt when I first set foot inside a Magna International facility. Like so many young professionals getting their start in the automotive sector, I viewed Magna International as a stepping stone to bigger things‚Äîafter all, they supply a significant volume of parts to nearly every major automaker, and they boast a name recognizable in countless corners of the industry. My initial role involved working on body and chassis projects, where I got to see up close exactly how Magna International manages production lines, delegates responsibilities among suppliers, and balances cost with quality.

However, it didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize that what Magna International touted as ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù frequently translated to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs cut corners where we can.‚Äù Those early experiences laid the foundation for a quieter suspicion: maybe Magna International didn‚Äôt always put forth the care and craftsmanship that car owners truly deserve. Around the same time, I started noticing a personal disconnect. Away from the office, I‚Äôd test-drive or rent various vehicles for day-to-day errands and family vacations‚Äîand time after time, it was¬†**Toyota**¬†or¬†**Honda**¬†that left the best impression on me.

# Why Honda and Toyota Captured My Heart

# 1. Reliability and Durability

The first time I drove a Toyota Camry, I was struck by its seamlessly smooth ride quality. Then I remember renting a Honda Civic for a business trip and being impressed by how it confidently handled highway cruising as well as stop-and-go traffic in a busy city center. These experiences weren‚Äôt fleeting. I consistently found that Honda and Toyota vehicles provided excellent reliability and needed fewer major repairs over the years‚Äîsomething thoroughly supported by consumer surveys and automotive reliability indexes¬†111. They just kept going, almost stubbornly, no matter what conditions they faced.

Magna International did, of course, produce certain components for these Japanese brands. Yet often, I saw that the most crucial, quality-intensive parts were meticulously designed by Honda or Toyota themselves, or assigned to carefully vetted suppliers that the brands had worked with for many years. Whenever I got a glimpse of the synergy between Toyota or Honda and their chosen parts suppliers, I noticed an incredible emphasis on robust engineering processes. It was the polar opposite of some of Magna International‚Äôs ‚Äújust good enough‚Äù mentalities.

# 2. Culture of Continuous Improvement

Many automotive enthusiasts are already aware of the concept of¬†**Kaizen**, a Japanese term meaning ‚Äúcontinuous improvement.‚Äù Honda and Toyota are widely known for incorporating Kaizen philosophies directly into their manufacturing and design processes¬†222. From an outsider‚Äôs perspective, it might appear like a marketing slogan‚Äîbut behind the scenes, it‚Äôs a deeply ingrained cultural approach that fosters collaboration, iterative improvements, and quality refinement. Even their factories are known for hyper-efficient, meticulously organized production lines.

During my years at Magna International, I noticed pockets of innovation here and there‚Äîsome brilliant engineers and managers truly wanted to refine processes and push for better results. But the overarching environment often rewarded short-term gains (like cost savings, meeting the bare-minimum contractual requirements, and churning out parts as fast as possible) rather than encouraging continuous, incremental improvement of processes. In Toyota and Honda facilities, workers themselves are empowered to stop the production line if they detect any anomalies. That kind of accountability is something I always craved but seldom encountered at Magna International.

# 3. Honda and Toyota‚Äôs Dedication to Customer Satisfaction

Another facet that drew me toward Honda and Toyota is their unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction. Warranty claims data and consumer reports consistently show lower incidences of serious mechanical issues or recalls in comparison to other mainstream automakers¬†333. When customers buy a Honda or a Toyota, they do so with confidence, knowing that these manufacturers stand by their products. It‚Äôs not a perfect system‚Äîno automaker is flawless‚Äîbut their accountability measures are generally more transparent.

Magna International, on the other hand, walks a fine line. As a Tier-1 supplier, it is indeed in Magna International‚Äôs best interest to serve the automakers as well as possible. But once a contract is secured, whether the ultimate end-customer is satisfied often feels peripheral. If the automaker continues to renew contracts with Magna International, that can sometimes overshadow genuine concerns about product integrity.

# Witnessing the Big 3‚Äôs Dominance at Magna International

Although Magna International has clients spanning numerous continents and car segments, my experience over two decades consistently showed that a¬†**significant proportion‚Äîsome 60-70%‚Äîof Magna International‚Äôs business came from the Big 3: Ford, General Motors, and Fiat/Chrysler (now Stellantis)**¬†444. This was no secret. Everyone at Magna International knew that the majority of resources, R&D funds, and strategic planning were oriented around appeasing these massive North American automakers.

# Cost-Driven Relationships

In my view, the reason for this deep entanglement was largely cost-driven. The Big 3 themselves had a vested interest in cutting costs, especially as global competition intensified in the early 2000s, and Magna International found success by underbidding other suppliers. However, cost concessions often lead to design compromises. It‚Äôs a delicate balance: produce parts cheaply enough to remain profitable but robust enough to pass OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) inspections. My colleagues and I frequently found ourselves walking on a tightrope between saving pennies and securing genuine product quality.

# The Influence on Honda and Toyota Contracts

Unfortunately, Magna International‚Äôs emphasis on the Big 3 often overshadowed smaller or more selective contracts.¬†**Take the contracts Magna International handled for Toyota or Honda, for instance.**¬†These were typically smaller in volume relative to the big North American alliances. However, the performance expectations from Honda and Toyota were notoriously strict. While the Big 3 might pass a component that met the bare legal or contractual requirement, Toyota and Honda demanded narrower tolerances and more robust quality checks. That‚Äôs why I frequently saw Magna International managers grumbling about how ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù Honda or Toyota could be when it came to product performance. But in my mind, it wasn‚Äôt unreasonable‚Äîthese two Japanese brands merely insisted on producing parts that truly aligned with their well-earned reputation for excellence.

# Failure Rates: A Candid Look

When I mention that Magna International‚Äôs¬†**failure rate, based on client demands, reached well over 60% for Honda and Toyota contracts**, I speak from direct involvement in the testing phases¬†555. These figures might shock outsiders. But it‚Äôs important to understand that ‚Äúfailure rate‚Äù in this context doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean parts were literally breaking in half left and right‚Äîit often meant the parts simply failed to meet the specified performance criteria set by Honda or Toyota. That could be something as small as a dimension being off by a fraction of a millimeter or a cosmetic imperfection that didn‚Äôt meet brand standards. Nevertheless, these so-called ‚Äúsmall‚Äù differences matter a great deal if your brand identity hinges on consistency and reliability.

And to Honda and Toyota‚Äôs credit, they repeatedly provided feedback and improvement steps‚Äîonly to watch Magna International‚Äôs cost-cutting approach undermine any real progress. Many talented engineers within Magna International tried to address concerns and refine processes, but senior leadership often pushed for meeting deadlines rather than doubling down on the modifications Honda or Toyota requested.

# 2008: A Pivotal Year

The year¬†**2008**¬†was a watershed moment in the automotive industry, marked by global economic downturns and sweeping changes in consumer buying behaviors. Automakers worldwide felt the pressure, and suppliers like Magna International scrambled to adjust. I distinctly remember Magna International‚Äôs renewed push to impress Honda around this time. With North American auto sales taking a hit, Magna International set its sights on capturing more Japanese brand contracts, especially from Honda, in order to diversify its client portfolio.

**One of the most peculiar stories**¬†from that era was how Magna International supposedly started using the same markers and pencils in their engineering facilities that Honda used. The leadership hailed this as a symbolic alignment with Honda‚Äôs philosophies. Internally, we all knew it was more about optics‚Äî**Magna International had historically used pastel China markers**, but they switched to the exact brand Honda favored, presumably to show a willingness to adopt the ‚ÄúHonda Way.‚Äù In reality, it struck many of us as a superficial gesture. Yes, standardizing certain materials could be a small step in matching Honda‚Äôs processes, but it was overshadowed by the larger, ongoing issues of poor leadership direction and cost-cutting.

# The ‚ÄúStupid Octopus‚Äù Moniker

In the corridors of Magna International, there were whispered rumors about how Japanese automakers referred to Magna International as the ‚Äú**stupid octopus**,‚Äù meaning it had its ‚Äúfilthy hands in all the pies but was stupid in leadership.‚Äù That‚Äôs a biting phrase, but it conveys a critical point about Magna International‚Äôs strategy. They rapidly expanded across various automotive domains and geographies‚Äîbody systems, seating, powertrains, electronics‚Äîyet the leadership approach often seemed shortsighted. Instead of focusing on refining each ‚Äútentacle‚Äù to excel in its own area, they overextended, reaping quick profits from some ventures while severely under-investing in others. From my vantage point, it looked less like a cohesive strategy and more like a scattershot attempt to dominate every possible segment without truly mastering any particular one.

This ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù analogy implies you can do everything, but not necessarily do anything extremely well. Some colleagues bristled at the notion that Magna International was incompetent in leadership; after all, the company was raking in billions of dollars in revenue. But as I frequently pointed out, financial success alone doesn‚Äôt confirm engineering excellence or product reliability‚Äîespecially if a significant portion of that success comes from undercutting other suppliers and meeting only the absolute minimum spec. When it came to Toyota and Honda, whose reputations hinge on stringent quality standards, Magna International‚Äôs leadership strategies repeatedly showed cracks.

# Pushing the Carriage Rather Than Pulling It

Internally, some managers would complain that Magna International was ‚Äúpushing the carriage rather than pulling it.‚Äù This metaphor underscores the approach Magna International sometimes took: forcing parts through production processes, constantly trying to keep up with shifting demands, rather than proactively shaping the trajectory of product quality. In a well-managed supply environment‚Äîlike the ones I‚Äôve seen from Japanese automakers‚Äîthere is a cohesive sense of ‚Äúpull,‚Äù where each stage of the process gracefully hands off to the next, ensuring everything meets or exceeds the established standard. When you push, you risk compounding mistakes or half-solutions, leading to rework, scrap, or end-customer dissatisfaction.

Honda and Toyota‚Äôs approach was far more systematic. Those companies often took the time to refine the conceptual design thoroughly before the first part was even assembled. Magna International typically wanted to start production ASAP to save on upfront design costs and shift the burden of testing onto the OEM or onto a later stage in the supply chain. This difference in philosophy was one reason the failure rates for Honda and Toyota projects soared well beyond acceptable thresholds‚Äîno matter what superficial changes were made (like adopting new markers), the culture of ‚Äúpush‚Äù overshadowed the culture of ‚Äúpull.‚Äù

# Earning My Appreciation for Honda and Toyota

As the years wore on, I found myself driving more Toyota and Honda vehicles. They were steadfast companions for my everyday needs, from commuting to weekend getaways. I appreciated their reliability, low maintenance costs, and overall peace of mind. Unlike some vehicles from other brands that would end up in the shop for everything from minor brake issues to transmission gremlins, my Hondas and Toyotas just‚Ä¶worked.

Hearing the inside scoop at Magna International‚Äîhow certain parts were hastily approved or how leadership decided to ignore an OEM‚Äôs recommended improvements‚Äîonly solidified my trust in these Japanese manufacturers. I often thought: ‚ÄúIf Honda or Toyota has to rely on a supplier like Magna International, they surely have their own stringent quality audits to catch potential defects.‚Äù That sense of comfort underscored my decision to stick to these brands when it came to personal vehicle purchases.

# A Closer Look: Parts Inspection if Magna International Is Involved

One thing I‚Äôll always suggest to friends and family: if you know Magna International is responsible for specific parts in your vehicle‚Äîbe it structural components, seat frames, or electronics‚Äî**it‚Äôs worth a closer look.**¬†Are there any recalls tied to those components? Have there been recurring issues reported by other owners? Does the OEM specifically cite any supplier-related concerns? Paying attention to details like these can help you stay proactive with maintenance and avoid compounding issues down the road.

That might sound cynical, especially coming from someone who spent so many years at Magna International, but it‚Äôs simply based on the repeated patterns I witnessed. Cost reduction often trumped everything else, and from a purely engineering standpoint, that can be detrimental if executed without nuance. Many in-house documents at Magna International used to highlight risk factors in bright red, only to have those risk factors brushed aside during the next budget meeting. For a brand like Honda or Toyota, they‚Äôd push back on such oversight, but for some other automakers, that pushback was less vigorous.

# Fraudulent Billing Practices at Certain Magna International Facilities

One of the more egregious practices I discovered in my later years at Magna International involved¬†**fraudulent billing of steel suppliers and material providers**. In certain facilities, managers and financial departments would generate¬†**bogus or inflated quality control reports**. These doctored numbers effectively shifted the blame for production errors or defective batches onto the suppliers, rather than acknowledging that the real problem lay within Magna International‚Äôs own cost-cutting measures or poor operational execution.

What this meant in practical terms was that Magna International could pass off the cost of reworked materials, scrapped components, or late shipments as a ‚Äúsupplier-covered expense.‚Äù Instead of accurately disclosing that¬†**‚Äúthis is Magna International‚Äôs cost of doing business and not following proper protocols,‚Äù**¬†the company (in those specific facilities) would falsify documentation to absolve itself of financial responsibility. I recall internal emails and whispers around the office lamenting how short-sighted and likely illegal these practices were. Yet, in those pockets of the company where it was happening, it continued in a hush-hush manner‚Äîpresented to upper management as ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù and swept under the rug by a broken ethical framework.

Such behavior highlights a deeper moral failing that can occur when leadership cares more about immediate profit margins than long-term partnerships or the company‚Äôs reputation. It was disheartening to witness these incidents, especially having worked alongside many diligent, ethically minded professionals who wanted Magna International to excel and do so with integrity. Unfortunately, in certain places, that integrity was drastically compromised.

# Corruption at Karmax Heavy Stamping (Cosma Division) in Milton, Ontario

While such unethical behavior wasn‚Äôt limited to a single division, one particularly¬†**corrupt**¬†facility caught my eye:¬†**Karmax Heavy Stamping (Cosma Division) in Milton, Ontario**. This division went so far as to¬†**rent diesel generators**¬†specifically to¬†**cheat the Milton Hydro techs**¬†during electrical usage readings. Normally, the inspectors from the local hydro company would arrive to gauge how much electricity the facility consumes on average, which in turn helps set a specific billing rate based on actual usage.

Karmax Heavy Stamping, however, would temporarily remove significant load off the grid by running these diesel generators during the inspection periods. By manipulating the apparent consumption, the facility could artificially reduce their billed usage rate, saving money at the expense of honest reporting. Not only did this practice¬†**violate ethical business standards**, but it also demonstrated a blatant disregard for the environment and the city of Milton. Running diesel generators releases harmful emissions into the local atmosphere‚Äîan irresponsible choice when so many organizations are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. It was just another telling example of how far certain divisions of Magna International would go to cut costs and maximize profit, even if it meant deceiving local utility inspectors and polluting the surrounding community.

# Living the Paradox

Some might question how I rationalized staying at Magna International for two decades if I had so many misgivings. There‚Äôs no straightforward answer. Magna International provided me with a livelihood, career growth opportunities, and a platform to hone my engineering knowledge. Throughout my tenure, I worked with incredible individuals‚Äîdedicated designers, QA specialists, and project managers‚Äîpeople who truly cared about doing the job right. We often tried to push for better results, and occasionally we succeeded. Small teams within Magna International would accomplish truly stellar work on specialized projects or for certain OEMs that demanded higher accountability.

At the same time, I had a front-row seat to decisions that undermined product excellence and moral practices. Navigating that tension wasn‚Äôt easy. Over time, I developed an even deeper respect for the likes of Honda and Toyota, who consistently demanded excellence from their suppliers and tried to enforce it.¬†**Those experiences formed the bedrock of my automotive loyalties.**

# Contrasting with the Big 3

I should clarify that the Big 3 are not devoid of innovation or success. Ford, GM, and Fiat/Chrysler have produced some remarkable vehicles‚Äîicons of the automotive world. I remember being personally impressed by certain GM trucks‚Äô capabilities and the design elements in some of Ford‚Äôs cars. Yet the ecosystem involving these brands, especially in North America, often yields a tug-of-war between union negotiations, cost targets, and ever-changing boardroom strategies. Magna International‚Äôs reliance on cost-optimized parts found an easier foothold with the Big 3, so from a pure business perspective, it made sense for Magna International to focus so heavily on them.

From the vantage point of a consumer who values reliability, though, it‚Äôs not surprising that I gravitated to Honda and Toyota vehicles. Their entire supply chain model, from concept to dealership, inherently fosters a more robust final product‚Äîparticularly in core mechanical and electronic systems.

# Future Outlook

Will Magna International change in the future? Over the decades, the company has certainly shown the capacity for growth, particularly in new technologies such as electrification, autonomous driving systems, and advanced manufacturing methods¬†666. Perhaps with the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), Magna International will find itself forced to compete more aggressively on quality rather than just cost, because EV components‚Äîbatteries, specialized electronics, control units‚Äîrequire high precision and durability. If Magna International invests in new leadership mindsets that align with the best practices of top-tier automakers, we could see a shift.

For Honda and Toyota, their trajectory seems clear. They‚Äôve already ventured into electrification, hydrogen fuel cells, and advanced driver-assistance systems, continuing to refine how they bring their vehicles to market. If they remain true to their Kaizen principles, they‚Äôll keep pushing boundaries in efficiency and reliability. Their supply chain will likely continue to demand more from partners, screening out those who can‚Äôt deliver. Whether Magna International can truly rise to that challenge remains to be seen.

# Final Reflections

I‚Äôve held many roles at Magna International, witnessed the behind-the-scenes negotiations with major carmakers, and seen firsthand how the same mistakes can be repeated unless there‚Äôs a cultural overhaul. Meanwhile, on the consumer side, I‚Äôve experienced the consistent quality of Honda and Toyota products‚Äîquality that stands the test of time. Yes, these brands might occasionally be critiqued for being ‚Äúboring‚Äù in design or ‚Äúconservative‚Äù in their approach, but I‚Äôd take reliability and substance over fleeting stylistic flourishes any day.

**Working at Magna International was an education in corporate automotive reality.**¬†But driving and maintaining Hondas and Toyotas became my personal antidote to that reality, reminding me that it‚Äôs entirely possible to maintain rigorous quality standards, treat suppliers as partners in a shared mission, and produce vehicles that customers can rely on for decades. Any automotive supplier or manufacturer that fails to uphold those ideals‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Magna International or another large entity‚Äîrisks becoming a cautionary tale of how short-sighted business practices can overshadow engineering brilliance, product integrity, and ethical conduct.

When you factor in the¬†**fraudulent billing**¬†of suppliers, deliberate glossing-over of real production errors, and manipulative schemes like¬†**renting diesel generators**¬†to cheat utility readings, it begs the question:¬†**With that kind of moral and business practice, how can anyone stand behind the company?**¬†From my vantage point as both an insider at Magna International and a dedicated Honda/Toyota driver, the answer seems quite clear.

So, yes, despite spending twenty years at Magna International,¬†**I remain an ardent fan of Honda and Toyota**‚Äînot out of mere brand loyalty, but because I‚Äôve seen the difference in how these companies operate, innovate, and care about their end-users.¬†**It‚Äôs not just about buying a car; it‚Äôs about the philosophy that goes into every nut and bolt.**¬†That philosophy is what truly sets Honda and Toyota apart and keeps me, and many others, returning to their dealerships whenever it‚Äôs time for a new ride.

"The Trisolarans' dominant strategy is to befriend Earth, not fight it",threebodyproblem,1hlqhsy,2024-12-24 19:53:21,54,0.9,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/threebodyproblem/comments/1hlqhsy/the_trisolarans_dominant_strategy_is_to_befriend/,modii1,Discussion - Novels,"Just finished reading Book 1, and I have some questions/thoughts. Would love to hear counter-arguments to my points, **but please don't spoil anything from the next two books.**

1. I think Ye Wenjie is a very well-motivated character. This entire story hinges on the believability of a human actively choosing to subjugate us to a power higher than us on the food chain, leading to our own destruction. Considering what Ye went through during the Cultural Revolution, her actions were at least understandable (though not agreeable). **I will say, I actually think the Netflix show did this better. In the show, Ye didn‚Äôt make the final decision to help the Trisolarans until** ***after*** **she had met with the girl who killed her father.** I think this is much more powerful, because it crystallizes the theme of the story. The way Netflix portrays it, if Ye had received an apology, it would have been a symbol of humanity‚Äôs capacity for redemption; and she may not have gone through with the Trisolaran contact. The book makes the same point with this scene, but I think it loses much of its impact by occurring *after* Ye has already forsaken humanity to the Trisolarans. The Netflix show uses that scene as the final tipping point for Ye, and I think that‚Äôs much more effective.

1. I very much enjoyed the puzzle-solving aspect of the story, i.e. having to figure out the nature of Trisolaris‚Äôs chaotic climate.

1. **Wang Miao was kind of boring.** When I have an issue with a protagonist, I like to analyze them with a rubric created by author Brandon Sanderson. He says that a good protagonist should be at least two of the following: proactive, competent, and sympathetic. In my estimation, the only one of these traits that Wang Miao exhibits is competence. And I feel like even that is not portrayed as powerfully as it could be. Yes, he figured out that Trisolaris suffers from the 3 Body Problem, but the way it was portrayed‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it didn‚Äôt *feel* like he had accomplished something major by figuring that out. Maybe it‚Äôs because many other people in the story (those who played the 3BP game) had figured it out too. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôd already watched season 1 of the Netflix show and knew the answer beforehand. Either way, even if I (reluctantly) grant him the ""competency"" metric,¬† I think he still fails on the other two.

1. **What the hell is the point of Wang Miao having a wife and kid?** They added nothing to the story. If anything, their presence took away from Wang Miao‚Äôs likeability because he treats them like afterthoughts. This is only made worse by the fact that he spends most of the story longing for and low-key obsessing over a woman he never actually met (Yang Dong). I have to assume that his wife and child will play a more significant role in the following books, because if not, their presence is inexplicable to me.
2. **The ETO‚Äôs, especially the Adventists‚Äô, ideological motivations seem weak to me.** The coffee shop scene felt especially cartoonish, because it seems like Adventist-sympathizers arrived at this position through a logical deduction that either humanity could not be saved or was not worth saving. But I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I feel like such extreme positions are only undertaken by people with strong *emotional* reasons (even if they won‚Äôt admit it to themselves). Of all the characters presented as part of the ETO, the only one whose motivation I could accept was Ye Wenjie.

1. The vetting process for joining the Adventists seems way too lax - show up in a coffee shop, lie about your intentions, and boom, you‚Äôre in? Like seriously? Pan Han is incompetent at best and deserved to get popped.

1. I like the fact that Earth and Trisolaris are evenly balanced - although Trisolaris is far more advanced technologically, the Earth‚Äôs rate of growth is much faster, such that they will likely outpace Trisolaris by the time they arrive. A good, solid game where neither party has a clear advantage. As someone who enjoys game theory, the premise of this story scratches an itch for me.¬†

1. **However, I simply don‚Äôt think Trisolaris is using the most effective strategy to ensure their survival.** In the book, it‚Äôs demonstrated that Trisolaris attacks Earth not only because they want to take it over, but also as a *defensive* measure. The idea being that if humans are allowed to advance, humans might surpass Trisolarians, view them as prey, and try to take over *their* planet. But like‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt Trisolaris kind of a shithole? Lol. It‚Äôs literally a dying planet that could get swallowed into the sun at any moment. Even if Earth develops the capability to take over Trisolaris‚Ä¶why the hell would they want to? Resources? No, because there are probably much closer options than traveling 4 light years away. Humans may not even need to leave the solar system for resources. Then, perhaps Earth might attack Trisolaris over ideological differences? Well, ideological differences only matter when you are physically close enough to the other party for their ideology to affect your life in some way (e.g. neighboring countries, or tribes sharing the same space).¬† But humans and Trisolarans are so far away from each other - who gives a fuck about the ideology of people on a dying planet 4 light years away? All this to say: the Trisolarans actively choosing to antagonize Earth almost 100% leads to a war scenario; and considering that they have very real reason to fear Earth, this seems like a bad idea. Why not try to befriend Earth instead? Maybe share some tech with them? Maybe with the two planets‚Äô best minds working together, combined with the fact that Earth doesn‚Äôt have to deal with Chaotic Eras, a solution for Trisolaris‚Äô problem could be found. Or maybe humans might even elect to share planet Earth with Trisolarans. Of course, the Trisolarians are right in their assessment that humans are a warfaring race, and friendly (or no) contact *might* end in Trisolarians‚Äô destruction. But antagonistic contact will *almost definitely* lead to the Trisolarians‚Äô destruction, unless they manage to defeat the humans. In general, I don‚Äôt see a downside to starting off with diplomacy and friendliness whenever dealing with a foreign entity. The possibility of war is always on the table. You‚Äôll get to it if you get to it. But I see no reason to make it a first resort.

1. The stuff about the sophons was fascinating. I really liked the chapter when we see the Trisolarans unfolding the protons. I only wish I had the physics knowledge to understand the mechanics of what they were doing. For those who do, this part of the book was probably super fun.¬† My favorite part was when they unfolded the proton into 3D, and it displayed intelligence by turning into a giant eye and trying to annihilate the capital city, lol. Is this what cosmic horror is? I‚Äôve never read/watched it before, but if this is it, I like it.¬† **But this makes me wonder - if unfolded protons are sentient, how can they control them? Is this something that will be explained later in the story?**

1. The scene at the end where Trisolaris sends the ‚ÄúYou are bugs‚Äù message to the Earth resistance group is weird to me. If Earthlings really are no more than bugs, why do you feel the need to tell them that? Do you take the time out of your day to verbally establish superiority before stepping on an anthill? The only possible reason I can think to send that message is to instill fear in the resistance group. But if you‚Äôre superior, why do you need Earth to fear you (especially when they already do!)? The message felt like a petulant, emotional reaction to getting caught spying. This is something I wouldn‚Äôt expect of Trisolarans, who are supposed to be relatively stoic.

1. Finally, the idea of irrational mob rule exhibited by Liu‚Äôs portrayal of the Cultural Revolution resonates with me. In recent years in the US, I‚Äôve increasingly felt as though rationality has been tossed aside in favor of mindless tribalism. Just as the purveyors of the Cultural Revolution eschewed modern science because much of it was coming from the West, I feel like many people today will ignore any information that does not serve their political purpose and refuse to acknowledge correctness in anything the opposing side does. This is something I truly detest, especially because this behavior is motivated by fear. The leaders fear being proven wrong and losing power. The followers fear being wrong, but they also fear being eaten alive by their compatriots if they step out of line.¬† In general I‚Äôd consider myself a populist, but what I learned from the Cultural Revolution in this book (I have almost no context/knowledge of it outside of 3 Body Problem) is that while an angry (perhaps even *justifiably* angry) youth can be an immense force for change, the difficulty in controlling this beast means that this change could easily be for the worse, rather than the better. (Through the lens of this book and that of my own ideologies, I would say the Cultural Revolution was for the worse, but I acknowledge that at the end of the day it‚Äôs a matter of perspective. I don‚Äôt know what conditions were like before, and perhaps many Chinese people look fondly upon the aftermath of the Revolution. Like I said, I‚Äôm not studied up on this, so I don‚Äôt know.)

Overall, although I have some issues with the book, I'm locked in for the ride and I can't wait to continue!

What are yall's thoughts?

The Grevic race was not known for its humor, creativity, or flexibility. Which made the giant pseudo-octopi great administrators and bureaucrats, but extremely poor on all social fronts. This did not, however, keep them from gossiping at work.

Grevic 2734932-9 sighed. ‚ÄúOne more world falls to the Mimics. What‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù he replied, his tentacles flicking idly.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it. The Mimics failed to infiltrate. They were detected and repulsed.‚Äù

Grevic 2734932-9 paused. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying? No galactic species has ever had a method for detecting infiltrators, let alone a barely-spacefaring, ominivorous death species! That‚Äôs absurd!‚Äù

Grevic 9992763-2 flicked its tentacles. ‚ÄúIt is true. I have the dispatch here. I can hardly believe it. Hold on a moment, let me broadcast this good news to the Overnet.‚Äù

As the Grevic 9992763-2 went to disseminate the news, Grevic 2734932-9 dissolved its cloying restrictive Octopoid form and ate Grevic 9992763-2 whole.

They marched back to HQ, where holographic battlemaps filled the walls. Several senior staff amassed. As the guards trained their rifles on the new arrivals, one challenged the Sergent. ‚ÄúTimson! This dumpster fire of a war, how would you describe things?‚Äù

Timson shrugged. ‚ÄúThis is fine.‚Äù

The man nodded. ‚ÄúPass.‚Äù 

Timson headed to the conference. The Galactic Civilizations had cautiously emerged from space months ago, looking to trade with new sapient species, but were oddly‚Ä¶ hesitant. They would not say WHY they were so skittish, but they obviously feared something.

Then reports came in. Reports of people acting weird, being weird, doing anti-human things. When shot, they reverted to a strange, semi-gelatinous, amorphous form that was quickly dubbed as Mimics. Once revealed and disseminated, the Galactic species became more talkative, if less willing to trade and interact.

He remembered one of the first briefings he ever had about them. 

‚ÄúThe Mimics are a species that is masterful at integration and infiltration,‚Äù the Saurid trader‚Äôs five henchmen nodded along with him, well versed in the bizarre biomimicry of the galactic scourge. ‚ÄúNo reliable method of detection has ever been produced to find them. They feed upon and manipulate all of society, and nowhere is safe. It makes us unsafe everywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say take off, nuke the site from orbit. It‚Äôs the only way to be sure,‚Äù one human Captain muttered.

The Saurids all stared at him, except for one, a cargo handler in the trader‚Äôs contingent. It lashed out with sudden tendrils, killing several instantaneously. The humans present, being humans, drew their sidearms and mowed it down in a burst of MagAcc rounds. When it quit twitching and appeared to be dead, MPs moved in to secure the scene, and xenobios began investigations even as the Saurid traders (those who had survived) looked both disturbed and amazed.

‚ÄúHow did you detect it? Were you really going to deploy nuclear weapons upon this location?‚Äù

Colonel Fitz blinked. ‚ÄúDo you people not know what sarcasm is? Or movie quotes?‚Äù

The Saurid shooks its head. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòsarcasm‚Äô does not translate, except as a ‚Äòlie that is obvious and humorous in a dark, unbelieveable manner‚Äô. Such a statement is not‚Ä¶ I understand what my translator is saying, I comprehend the words, but we have no concept for it.‚Äù

The colonel stared. ‚ÄúYou have no concept for it, or the Galactic Civilization has no concept for it?‚Äù

The Saurid shrugged. ‚ÄúIs there a difference?‚Äù

The Colonel smiled.

- * -

Earth was mostly pacified. Trade with the galactic civilizations was mostly reestablished through some small, temporary orbitals that had been established. Which would normally cost the hosting civilization a dear sum, but‚Ä¶ the humans had proven miraculously capable of detecting Mimics. So much so, that starships began diverting to the Terran system in order to have their crews vetted and measured by the Terrans as safe or not safe. Quickly signs of ‚Äúit has been X stops since we were last cleared by Terran inspections for Mimics‚Äù were cropping up in general parlance and even in actual labels on starship bulkheads.

One such ship was docking now, at Terran Station Oxymoron. 

Yes, the Terrans had named it. No, the various alien species didn‚Äôt really get the joke.

They also didn‚Äôt comprehend the sign that said, ‚ÄúStupidity is Terminal in this system. No refunds. We break it, you bought it.‚Äù

A bulk cruiser‚Äôs full crew disembarked and filtered into a customs holding area, the Captain holding his crew of twenty in a small, measurable gaggle. The ursinoid Captain followed the signs until they were in an interview room, complete with seating for all of the crew. It was only then, when all crew were comfortable, that a single Earthling Inspector entered. 

‚ÄúJesus you guys stink!‚Äù the Inspector said without warning. ‚ÄúDid you marinate for your whole journey in skunk shit?‚Äù

One crew, a black-faced Fengail marsupiloid, rose from its chair. ‚ÄúWe do not smell that bad, just different‚Äù it exclaimed. 

The Inspector rounded the table and approached the crewman. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very perceptive. Did you figure that all out by yourself?‚Äù

The creature stared, then responded, ‚ÄúYes, I did.‚Äù

-ZAP-

One dead mimic on the deck, and the rest of the crew in shock and horror. All except the Captain, who was cautiously pleased, at least by his body language. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ pardon, Inspector, but how did you know?‚Äù

The Inspector smirked. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt understand. And neither do the Mimics.‚Äù

The Captain shrugged. ‚ÄúWe galactic races admire your astonishingly high detection rate of Mimics despite their perfect biological mimicry. We just wish we knew how you did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could tell you, but then I‚Äôd have to kill you. Plus, nobody plans a murder out loud,‚Äù he added, staring at several of the other crew who looked sketchy to him.

One, a grayish reptiloid, shed its form and brandished a pistol, only to be gunned down by the Inspector‚Äôs pistol faster than anybody had expected. After all of the crew had calmed and taken a few breaths or a drink of water, the Inspector smiled.

‚ÄúSee? Your crew is two Mimics lighter.‚Äù

The Captain stared at the human, who was obviously mad. ‚ÄúI do not understand your ways,‚Äù his translator relayed, ‚Äúbut I can appreciate your results.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat does not surprise me, Captain. As the captain of your own ship, you understand the chain of command, yes?‚Äù

The Captain nodded. 

The Inspector smiled, then pulled out a length of oddly-marked chain, each thick link an inch across, and attached to a broad black handle. The man touched a button in the handle, and the chain‚Äôs links began to glow and sizzle with a dull red heat that promised suffering.

‚ÄúWell, we humans find explaining this to alien crews to be quite illuminating. The way we describe the chain of command is as the chain that we beat the crew with until they understand who is in fucking command, capiche?‚Äù

Two more mimics revealed themselves before being gunned down by automated defenses.

- * -

The Inspector put away his props as he returned to the Customs and Immigration terminal. He poured himself a cup of coffee before slouching into a well-padded chair, glancing at his coworkers.

‚ÄúRough day, Simpson?‚Äù Inspector Meyers asked. 

‚ÄúOh, ya think?‚Äù he asked exasperatedly.

‚ÄúYes, I do,‚Äù Meyers replied quickly, before blanching. ‚ÄúI-‚Äú

The Inspector, plus three others already in the room, gunned down Meyers in a flurry of energy bolts. A steaming Mimic corpse was revealed a moment later.	

Kaperson, another Inspector, glanced over at Simpson. ‚ÄúFuck, been a while since a Mimic nailed an Inspector. We gotta report it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust let me head to my quarters first. Got some farming to do, gotta go see if I‚Äôve grown some fucks to give yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlas, the fields of fucks have long since been barren,‚Äù replied Kaperson,

Simpson smiled. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôd‚Äôve thought our most valuable export to the galaxy would be sarcasm, metaphor, and movie quotes?‚Äù

Gutierrez, the newest (and the brownest) of the three Inspectors present, said, ‚ÄúSomeone said aliens, I thought they said illegal aliens, and signed up.‚Äù

They all grinned."

Lilith was driving me to the edge. I was white knuckled on a rollercoaster with no breaks, and I was starting to go off the rails. No one could help me.¬†

I screamed and pleaded and begged, but she wasn‚Äôt going to let me off.

The only way off was to be with her. To give her what she wanted.

I was so fucking ready to give in.

I still can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt give in.

\-

Charlie had his head in my lap with his tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth. He was panting so hard, but he was still talking to me. Charlie never stopped talking to me. He kept talking right until the end.

Daddy was driving fast and the old truck was rattling louder than it normally did as we flew down the road. I saw a bunch of other kids playing outside and I wished I was them. I wished I didn‚Äôt have to be doing what I was doing.

Daddy kept wiping his eyes. I saw him cry. I don‚Äôt know if it was because he was sad for Charlie, or because he knew there was nothing he could do to help his little girl.

\-

I saw our reflection in the glass doors as we went into the vet‚Äôs office. I was running to keep up with Daddy, and Charlie was hanging limply in his arms. His tail wasn‚Äôt moving. That wooden pocket watch that Daddy had made and painted gold, hung down from the blue ribbon around Charlie‚Äôs neck.

With each step, it swung back and forth like a pendulum. The minutes were counting down.

All dogs go to heaven, but those are hollow words when you‚Äôre watching them go through hell.

\-

The table. The damned cold metal table. I didn‚Äôt want Charlie to have to lay on it, so I took off my jacket and put it underneath him. He kept talking to me. His voice was tired, but I think he was trying to tell me it was going to be ok. He kept moving his head and licking the tears off of my face. His body was shaking.

The doctor told me and Daddy that there was nothing he could do. Charlie was sick. Charlie was old. The doctor left.

Daddy put his head next to mine. His strong voice was breaking while my old dog was dying.

‚ÄúBaby. We have to let him go. He‚Äôs hurting really bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt we get him some medicine?‚Äù

‚ÄúMedicine isn‚Äôt going to help him anymore, baby.‚Äù

I put my face up against Charlie‚Äôs. I had never known life without my dog. I was eight, and I didn‚Äôt want to know life without him.

‚ÄúCharlie, please don‚Äôt leave me.‚Äù¬†

The doctor came back in with a needle.

I hate needles. They do bad things.

I heard Charlie start to bark, but it was coming from somewhere far away.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs barking Daddy!‚Äù

The doctor was petting my dog while he held the needle next to his leg.

Charlie was barking somewhere.

‚ÄúDaddy. He‚Äôs better now! Don‚Äôt let the doctor do it!‚Äù

The doctor pushed that awful needle into my friend.¬†

Charlie was barking somewhere.

‚ÄúDaddy, make him stop! Charlie‚Äôs better now! I can hear him!‚Äù¬†

I was standing outside of myself. I saw my dad petting my head while I was petting my dog. Charlie‚Äôs eyes were locked onto mine. He knew what was about to happen.

Charlie talked for just a second and then he was quiet. He stopped moving. He peed on the metal table.

He was still barking somewhere.

My Daddy whispered in my ear.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be ok, baby. The sun‚Äôs gonna come up tomorrow. You just try and get some sleep.‚Äù He kissed my neck just behind my ear.

My neck burned. Charlie was barking.¬†

Daddy was frozen. I was frozen.

I wanted to scream. I couldn‚Äôt move. His lips were setting my neck on fire.

I could hear the dog trying to get in the sliding glass window.

\-

I woke up in pain. Jessica was stirring in my arms. We were sleeping on an air mattress on my parents' bedroom floor. I got up slowly, trying not to cry out in agony. My parents were still asleep.¬†

I hoped they were still my parents.

I ran to the bathroom, turned on the shower, and ducked my head underneath the cold water and I felt the raised skin on the back of my neck with my fingers. The burning was turning into a dull ache.

I opened the drawer and grabbed the small mirror and held it to the back of my neck so I could see it in the larger mirror.

There was a new burn. Lilith had kissed me while I was asleep. Her lips had burned into me and left me with another scar.¬†

\-

For two days, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I showed my parents the burn. The cops took pictures of it. They all reassured me that Lilith couldn‚Äôt have gotten inside.

I was constantly asking my mom and dad questions from my youth that only they would know the answer to. I second guessed myself over and over, trying to remember exactly which stories I had told Lilith about growing up.

I felt like I had told her everything. She might have had all the right answers.

\-

I was constantly looking for any sign of how Lilith could have slipped inside the house. The winking cop from the cruiser outside kept walking around the outside of my parents house, but he couldn‚Äôt find any sign that she had been there either. At least, that‚Äôs what he told my father. How was I supposed to trust him?

\-

Detective Hopkins came by on the second day and we talked out on the porch. The sun was just starting to go down and Homer and Joe were sitting on their porch next door, drinking their cups of decaf pretending that they weren‚Äôt listening to every word.¬†

I noticed another coffee stain on Hopkin‚Äôs shirt. He seemed different than he was before. His blue eyes were colder.¬†

‚ÄúEvening, Amy. You look like you‚Äôre not getting any rest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs probably best that you try.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like you still haven‚Äôt fixed that hole in your lip.‚Äù His eyes darted down to the stain.

‚ÄúSon of a bitch.‚Äù He moved his tie to the left, trying to cover the stain. There was no smile, just a stone face. ‚ÄúAlright, where do I start? We got the results back from the blood tests.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. Everything was normal for both you and the deceased.‚Äù

‚ÄúDetective, I‚Äôm telling you that she drugged us both with something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the tests say something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about my neck? She had to have drugged me to do that, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmy, there‚Äôs no evidence that anyone broke into the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell how the hell did she burn me then?!‚Äù¬†

An awkward pause.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing it to myself, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen. I need you to tell me what really happened in that bar. I need you to tell me how that man died.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI told you what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmy, I‚Äôm going to figure out what‚Äôs going on here very soon. It‚Äôd be a lot easier if you were just straight with me. I already know what he died from, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how it happened while he was sitting across a table from you in a crowded bar.‚Äù

For the rest of the conversation, it was obvious that I was now a suspect.

Lilith was laughing somewhere.

\-

I couldn‚Äôt see a way out. Everyone thought I was nuts, or worse. My life was over.

The second day was over.

I had no idea what she was going to do next.

\-

I tried my best to keep my head clear, but that‚Äôs difficult when you think you‚Äôre being investigated for murder. I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. I wanted to believe my parents were ok. I even doubted that Jessica was herself.

I was mourning the loss of my daughter and holding her close to me at the same time.

The third and fourth days just began to run into one another.¬†

No word at all from Lilith.

My body was trying to force me to sleep, and the few times I almost gave in, but the dog would always start barking and slapping his paws against the glass door.

I went through moments when I thought the dog somehow knew when I was about to fall asleep, and that he was trying to help me stay awake. Then I went through moments when I thought it was Lilith posing as the dog, making me stay awake. Trying to drive me crazy.

Either way, I was losing it.

\-

I knew my body was going to betray me. Eventually I was going to crash. I was drinking coffee constantly, and walking laps through the house, but my brain finally lost the battle.

I had fallen asleep at the dinner table and my father had carried me to my bed. The only thing I remember from that night was the constant barking.

When I woke up, there was a new burn on my right calf.

\-

I didn‚Äôt say anything to the cops, but it was obvious what my parents thought. They thought I was doing it to myself, they just didn‚Äôt know how. My mother had taken out the cleaning chemicals from underneath all of the sinks.

My father put a padlock on the door to the garage.

They didn‚Äôt say anything. They didn‚Äôt have to. It was only a matter of time before they would make the decision to put me in a hospital.

They both asked me not to tell Detective Hopkins about it.

I had to hold it together. I had to put forward a sane face. I had to figure out some way of ridding myself of Lilith and it would start with the damn necklace.

\-

I took the picture frame that I had made, and the necklace and walked into the backyard.

The dog was out there waiting for me; just staring at me while I threw Lilith‚Äôs shit inside of the garbage can. I walked over to him, but he didn‚Äôt move. I stopped within a couple feet of him.

‚ÄúAre you really a dog?‚Äù

He walked to me and put his front paw on my leg.

He looked so much like Charlie, but I couldn‚Äôt touch him.

She knew about my dog.

\-

I could hear Jessica through the wall, laughing in the backyard. My mom would make the old dog sit while Jessica would go and hide, then my mom would say ‚Äúsic ‚Äòem!‚Äù and the dog would run and find Jessica.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs finding me grandma! I can‚Äôt hide!‚Äù

They were doing it over and over.

I was in the bath staring at the ceiling. I kept tracing the mark Lilith had given me on my neck with my fingers. I kept staring at the one on my calf.¬†

I was working out the problem. I needed to make her go away. How could I make her go away? I was accepting the fact that I couldn‚Äôt. I had no control.

The white ceiling became the perfect background for the images going through my mind. My memory kept going back to an awful video that Jim had asked me to watch.¬†

A jar with a crab inside of it was submerged into a tank with an octopus.

The octopus wrapped a tentacle around the jar and slowly pulled it closer, while the crab inside was pushing against the glass, helpless to get out. The octopus climbed on top and all of its tentacles draped down the sides of the jar, while the crab struggled inside. The body of the octopus twitched and undulated while it unscrewed the lid and then discarded it. Its entire body squeezed inside of the jar and descended over its meal.

The crab never had a chance.

My eyes fluttered and I fell asleep.

\-

I saw Lilith standing on the roof of our house. Her body melted and it began to run down from the roof and cover our entire home. I saw my family banging on the windows inside, screaming until the house was completely covered in a milky film that twitched and pulasted.

It devoured everything.

\-

I woke up in the tub; the water had drained. I had no idea how long I had dozed off. My body was numb, but my right leg was burning.

It was high up on my inner thigh; another kiss from Lilith.

I was weeping silently in the empty tub. I couldn‚Äôt let anyone hear me. I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone.

I stayed there until my head felt clear; until whatever she was drugging me with wore off.

The door was locked. The only window was a small one above the tub that looked out on the backyard.

I wondered how she could have possibly got in.

My eyes moved to the narrow metal vent on the wall just below the ceiling. The paint looked slightly blistered.

I wondered if she was behind it, watching me.

I could hear my father talking to someone in the dining room.

I listened to my mom and my daughter playing with their new friend. They had been out there the whole time, all three of them.¬†

Unless Lilith was all of them, she couldn‚Äôt be any of them. At least, that‚Äôs what passed for reasoning in my exhausted mind.

By the time I could move, I knew what I was going to do next.

\-

I tried my best to stay calm.

I had a role to play, and if I was being watched, I needed to sell it.

My dad was sitting at the kitchen table with the winking cop from outside, and they were both having a cup of coffee and talking about the Cowboys. I walked past them and opened the sliding glass door. Jessica was asking the dog to sit in exchange for Vienna Sausages while my mom was laughing. The dog was talking and his tail never stopped moving.

‚ÄúJessica. Get back inside the house please.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just feeding Charlie, Mommy! He‚Äôs a good boy!‚Äù

I walked out onto the lawn and snatched her by her wrist and pulled her away from the dog.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hurting me!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt listen. My mother was telling me to calm down as I led Jessica back inside.

‚ÄúYou are not to go outside of this house, do you understand me?!‚Äù She was crying. ‚ÄúJessica?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just playing with Charlie!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat thing is not Charlie! Go to your room!‚Äù Jessica was sobbing as she ran down the hall. My mother shot me a look as she walked past me and followed Jessica. I locked the sliding glass door while the bony old dog was doing his best to lick every bit of grease he could out of the empty can of sausages that Jessica had dropped.

‚ÄúAmy. You need to calm down.‚Äù

I turned to my dad. The cop was staring at the floor. He was very young and he looked very uncomfortable.

‚ÄúWhy is he inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney, this is Officer Avery.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, Pete.‚Äù He looked at my eyes, but then quickly looked away.

‚ÄúI just thought he could use a break from sitting in his car.‚Äù

I stared at them both without saying a word until the kid in a police uniform thanked my dad for the coffee and left.

‚ÄúThat was a little drastic, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want that thing gone, Dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat thing? Pete or the dog?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dog. You all need to stay inside the house. You can‚Äôt let anybody in.‚Äù

He walked over to me.

‚ÄúOk. You wanna know something? I never liked Lilith. I just smiled and nodded my head most of the time because she was your friend, but I could see something in her eyes that made me feel like I was looking at a bad person. Same thing with Jim. I probably should have said something about both of them, but I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm going to say something now. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that dog and he ain‚Äôt going anywhere because my granddaughter already went and fell in love with him. Pete‚Äôs a nice kid, and if I want to invite a nice kid into my home for coffee, I‚Äôm going to.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou know he comes back even when his shift is over? Sits out there in his car on his own time. Good kid. I love you and I know you‚Äôre scared, but that was over the line. If I were you, I‚Äôd go in there and apologize to my daughter.‚Äù

He walked down the hall and left me.

\-

I walked into the backyard and opened the back gate that led out onto the street. The dog watched me the entire time. I hoped I was right. I needed to be right.

‚ÄúCharlie.‚Äù I whispered. He cocked his head. ‚ÄúHe had to name you Charlie, didn‚Äôt he? Come here.‚Äù I lifted my pant leg and let him sniff at the sore on my calf.

‚ÄúGood boy. Now sic ‚Äòem! Sic ‚Äòem!‚Äù

The dog ran out of the back gate, barking like mad as if he was chasing something. I followed him.¬†

Pete was watching me as I ran through the front yard like a crazy person. The dog was standing on the other side of the house and looking up.¬†

He was barking at the metal vent at the top of the house.¬†

I walked over as if I saw nothing. I tried to only take quick glances at the metal vent and the blistered paint on the outside of it.

‚ÄúCharlie! Come here!‚Äù

I walked him into the backyard. He was yammering along, telling me in his own way what he had been barking at.

I went back inside.

Lilith had been near me the entire time, not posing as one of my family, but hiding in our attic.

\-

‚ÄúNo. No way.‚Äù I knew my dad was going to argue with me.¬†

‚ÄúDad please. I need you to go away. I need you guys out of the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is insane.‚Äù

The dog was in the family room with my mother and Jessica. I insisted that they all stay in the same room. I had convinced my dad to go into the garage with me. There were no attic vents in the garage. I hoped that Lilith wouldn‚Äôt hear our conversation.

‚ÄúI know you and mom are thinking I‚Äôm doing these things to myself. I‚Äôm not. Right now, I know that all of you are ok. I NEED to know you guys are ok. I need you to drive somewhere. I don‚Äôt want to know where you‚Äôre going to go, but you don‚Äôt come back until I call you. I‚Äôll figure out how to fix this.‚Äù

‚ÄúFix this? Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre not confused. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre right about everything. What are you gonna do? Kill her?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He sighed and looked at the ceiling.

‚ÄúThis is crazy‚Ä¶ so damn crazy. Ok! If you‚Äôre right, how am I supposed to know that it‚Äôs you who‚Äôs calling me?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôll tell you that I saw you crying when we drove Charlie to the vet to put him down. I‚Äôve never told anyone that. Daddy, please. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúTake the lock off of the garage.‚Äù

\-

They were gone. I was sitting on the front porch having a cigarette and the dog was next to me. It was getting cold and I could see the cop sitting in his cruiser staring at me in the darkness. I had the porch light off, and my mom‚Äôs little solar lights on the walkway were barely giving off any light.

A little bit behind the cruiser, Pete was in his own car dressed in plain clothes. He was asleep in his seat when I came out, but he woke up when I closed the front door behind me.

I watched him trying to act like he wasn‚Äôt looking at me.

I wanted to be outside. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt think inside of¬† the house. I couldn‚Äôt think while Lilith‚Äôs eyes might be watching me. I had filled my dad‚Äôs old metal thermos full of coffee, and I was halfway through it when my phone vibrated.

‚ÄúAmy?‚Äù

‚ÄúLilith?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you figured out where I was. Good for you. Always so smart. Did you feel me looking back at you? I‚Äôm not there anymore.‚Äù

An awkward pause.

‚ÄúNothing to say?‚Äù

Another.

‚ÄúAmy?‚Äù

She always hated awkward pauses.

‚ÄúAmy, you better answer me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOr you‚Äôll do what you sick fuck? Did you follow my family? I don‚Äôt think so. I think you‚Äôd be too afraid I‚Äôd run somewhere and you couldn‚Äôt find me. I‚Äôm laughing at you Lilith. You‚Äôre absolutely pathetic. I can‚Äôt believe I was ever so low to have a friend like you. You were nothing but a waste of my time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always thinking, aren‚Äôt you?! Guess I‚Äôm going to have to be a little more creative now that you‚Äôve got that fucking dog! Maybe you‚Äôll get to watch ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù die all over again. What do you...‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm never talking to you again, Lilith. I hope you‚Äôre watching this.‚Äù

I closed the call and I dropped the phone on the concrete walkway. I brought my father‚Äôs thermos down on it over and over again until my phone was in pieces.

I finally felt like I had some control. For the first time I had hope that I could figure a way out of everything. A way out of her.

For some reason, I got up and walked over to Pete‚Äôs car. He looked like hell, and it was obvious that he never expected me to walk over to him because he was fidgeting like a cornered animal in the front seat. He rolled down his window. Charlie stood up and put his front paws on the door and sniffed at Pete.

‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô alright, Mam?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas that her on the phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come on Pete. I‚Äôm the suspect now, aren‚Äôt I? Lilith‚Äôs just a myth. You don‚Äôt believe me, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù

There was a pause, but there was no awkwardness. It felt good to have someone say that they believed me, although I had no idea why he did.

‚ÄúLooks like you‚Äôve warmed up to Charlie.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow old are you Pete? You look like you‚Äôre twelve.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm twenty three, Mam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got better things to do than sit here when you‚Äôre off duty. What are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot right now it‚Äôs not. Why are you always here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI just want to make sure you‚Äôre ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, huh? Why did you say that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you say you believed me?‚Äù

Another pause. He looked straight ahead and bit his lip.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I just feel like I should be here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you believe me?‚Äù

He seemed to be searching for an excuse, but he must have come up short. He sighed.

‚ÄúThe reason I decided to become a cop was because of my mom. My dad, he‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a really bad guy. He hurt her a lot. When I was eight, she took me and ran. He followed us everywhere. Wouldn‚Äôt accept the fact that she didn‚Äôt want him.¬†

Had family and friends keep tellin‚Äô her that she was makin‚Äô somethin‚Äô outta nothin‚Äô. Tellin‚Äô her she needed to go back. That it was all her fault. My mom got so tired, she eventually gave in and went back to him. He knocked her head against the stove just a couple of months later. He‚Äôs sittin‚Äô in prison now, and my mom‚Äôs buried out in Seguin.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they‚Äôve got a missin‚Äô piece too. Everything happenin‚Äô to you, none of it makes sense, but I can see it on your face that you‚Äôre tellin‚Äô the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I stay out here. Eventually, she‚Äôs gonna show back up. We‚Äôll get her.‚Äù

‚ÄúPete? Make sure your doors are locked and your windows are rolled up. Don‚Äôt open up for anybody. I‚Äôll see you in the morning.‚Äù

\-

I was in the garage, standing next to my dad‚Äôs workbench. The necklace that Lilith had given me all those years ago was in front of me. I had fished it out of the garbage can after thinking about what Pete said.¬†

*‚ÄúI guess when someone takes a piece of you like that, you can just see it in other people when they‚Äôve got a missing piece too.‚Äù*

I stared at the small point where the two streaks came together. I wanted to sever it.

There was a small gold cap at the top of the stone where the chain was affixed. I took a couple of tools and worked at the top. Eventually, I felt something snap, and that little gold cap unscrewed. A small part of the stone had been hollowed out. Something was moving inside of it.

I poured the rest of the coffee out of the thermos, and I shook the stone over it.

A small drop fell out of the stone and plopped at the bottom of the thermos. It was moving around. I remembered what Lilith had said.

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something special inside of it.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúA little bit of me.‚Äù*

Looking for Feedback on My Long-Term Crypto Investment Strategy,CryptoMarkets,1hip31h,2024-12-20 12:36:24,3,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hip31h/looking_for_feedback_on_my_longterm_crypto/,JuWu90,Strategy,"\*\*\* This is all my own research and thoughts but the text is optimized by ChatGPT. Apparently this is important to some people \*\*\*

Hi everyone,

After sitting on the sidelines for far too long, I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to take a more serious approach to cryptocurrency investing. A few years ago, I got involved with too many shitcoins and lost motivation‚Äîunfortunately. I just kept a very small portion of BTC, ETH, and BNB.

Now, I want to make a fresh start. I have some savings in a 3% p.a. savings account that I want to partially invest in crypto. Yes, I admit that I do have some FOMO, but to avoid risking too much at once, I plan to use a hybrid approach of a lump sum investment combined with monthly DCA. With the current dip, I of course want to start as soon as possible.

I‚Äôm not looking for quick wins or risky plays‚ÄîI want to build a long-term portfolio focused on projects with solid fundamentals that I can hold for years.

Here‚Äôs the strategy I‚Äôm planning to implement:

# Monthly Investment Plan:

# Store of Value

* **Bitcoin (BTC):** 35%

# Smart Contracts & dApps

* **Ethereum (ETH):** 30%
* **Binance Coin (BNB):** 10%

# Scalability & Interoperability

* **Cardano (ADA):** 5%
* **Polkadot (DOT):** 5%
* **Polygon (MATIC):** 5%
* **Avalanche (AVAX):** 5%

# Exploration & Growth (5%)

For this category, I am considering speculative options that could complement my core portfolio. Some contenders include:

* **XRP:** Focused on efficient cross-border payments.
* **Chainlink (LINK):** Provides crucial Oracle technology for DeFi.
* **VeChain (VET):** Blockchain solutions for supply chain management.
* **Stellar (XLM):** Optimized for affordable and fast transactions.

# Investment Approach (example)

* **Lump Sum:** Allocate 25,000 USD immediately across the above projects
* **DCA:** Invest around 1,000-2,000 USD per month across the above projects

# Why These Coins?

I‚Äôve grouped these coins based on their roles in the crypto ecosystem‚Äîstore of value, smart contracts, scalability, and interoperability. My goal is to focus on projects with strong technical foundations, clear use cases, and active development teams. I believe this covers the essential pillars of the crypto space while avoiding speculative or meme-driven plays.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For:

* Does this strategy make sense for a long-term approach?
* Am I missing any critical projects that should be part of a long-term portfolio?
* Any thoughts on the allocation percentages or the technologies I‚Äôm focusing on?

I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback and insights. Thanks in advance for your time and advice!"
Why These 5 Altcoins Are of Choice in December 2024 for Long-Term Success,Blockviews,1hibnvi,2024-12-19 23:17:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1hibnvi/why_these_5_altcoins_are_of_choice_in_december/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: As we step into December 2024, the crypto market is buzzing with incredible opportunities for savvy investors. While $BTC remains the heavyweight champion, the altcoin arena is showcasing some trailblazers with massive growth potential. If you are scouting for the best altcoins to invest in this festive season, keep an eye on $TICS (Qubetics), $TON (Toncoin), $LINK (Chainlink), $VET (VeChain), and $HBAR (Hedera).

Qubetics, the brilliant Web3 aggregator, is making waves with its decentralised VPN, redefining internet privacy and security. Already riding high with $7.2M raised in presale, $TICS could evolve into a superstar for those chasing exponential returns.  

Toncoin simplifies crypto payments for the masses, integrating seamlessly with Telegram. Think of it as the people's mesh to bring blockchain mainstream ‚Äî accessible, scalable, and ready to redefine peer-to-peer interactions.

Chainlink continues to shine in the decentralised oracle space, connecting blockchain to real-world data. A backbone of DeFi innovation, $LINK's value will undoubtedly grow as smart contracts go beyond theory and power real-life applications.

VeChain, with its supply chain dominance, is revolutionising how industries track and trace goods. From food safety to healthcare logistics, $VET is solving problems that matter ‚Äî making it a standout contender for investors who think long-term.

And let's not sleep on Hedera. With its blazing speed and energy-efficient Hashgraph tech, $HBAR is becoming the go-to blockchain for enterprises spanning finance to healthcare. The focus here? Transactions made smarter and greener.

These altcoins are not just tokens; they are solutions pushing the envelope of blockchain utility. Want to ride the next big wave in crypto? This could be your moment to act.

1) I have ZERO idea what the Vechain Renaissance means. Can someone break it down like you're explaining to a 5 year old? What exactly is happening? From my research, I heard it's good for VTHO holders? Can you explain why?

2) All these years I've had my VET/VTHO in Binance US...which scares me if Binance ever goes down or what not. Where is the safest place to keep them? What do most of you use?

‚ÄúHold here and prepare to assist in a secondary capacity.‚Äù Sabisstra coldly ordered her Regulators who was staring with wide eyes at the sight of Dr Grine in the flesh. ‚ÄúI need not remind you that you are under oath to hold your tongue when we deal with these interlopers.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood Ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Slarah answered before any of the other Regulators could speak up. ‚ÄúYou all heard the Lictor! Zethrik, maintain overwatch with the remaining drones! Vexar, set up a defense on the main door and get ready to hold the line! Everyone else, assist Dr Grine‚Äôs staff!‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam!‚Äù Several of the Regulators saluted and immediately carried out their duty, while others hesitated and slowly meandered about. Sabisstra made note of those names for later‚Ä¶

The Order of the Infernal Harmony had already been purged of much of their weakness. There was always the opportunity to cut more out before the rebuilding began‚Ä¶

‚ÄúLictor, what do we do?‚Äù Slarah asked her once the two of them were alone.¬†

‚ÄúThis‚Äôll be a tough fight,‚Äù Sabisstra admitted stoically. ‚ÄúThough we are hardly weak ourselves. Grine!‚Äù She called out. ‚ÄúDo you have a way out if we need it?‚Äù

‚ÄúKull and the others are using the secret tunnels to position themselves,‚Äù Grine called back as he typed something on a console on the other side of the room, causing a canister on the nearby desk to open and hiss in a puff of smoke. ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt use them, we still have other options. But I have no desire to abandon this place unless I have to!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we fight.‚Äù Slarah grimly nodded.¬†

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù Sabisstra nodded as she kept her eyes on the rest of her Order as they carried out their orders. ‚ÄúSomehow they followed us, and I don‚Äôt like it. Say what you will about our combat effectiveness, but I personally vetted everybody for loyalty. There‚Äôs no traitor among our ranks that I can‚Äôt detect.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen they clearly resorted to other methods.‚Äù Slarah allowed a rare sigh, wincing as the motion caused her facial wounds to flare up once again. ‚ÄúRegardless, they are here. Lictor, what exactly is going on? It is clear that The Redeemer was a false patron, but I don‚Äôt understand the details.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou will soon enough. I had planned to induct you and several of the others into the Court myself as part of our next wave of expansion,‚Äù Sabisstra admitted. ‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs just you. The others will be mind-wiped for operational security until I deem them worthy enough of the honour. Even if they won‚Äôt talk freely, they can still be compromised.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou honour me, Lictor.‚Äù Slarah bowed her head in respect, before she began casting.¬†

‚ÄúKull, what is your status?‚Äù Grine hissed into his comms as he rushed to a terminal in front of one of the medical pods, examining the data for the moment before engaging the unlock.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre approaching slowly,‚Äù the Xarak growled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in position and ready to engage. Some of them are fanning out, but the main body is heading right towards you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny idea how? We should be hidden!‚Äù The doctor cursed.¬†

‚ÄúSvaarzhul knows what he‚Äôs doing, it can‚Äôt be anything magical.‚Äù Kull snarled.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely the Regulators were followed here unknowingly.‚Äù Svaarzhul sighed. ‚ÄúProbably via some sort of tech. I knew this was a poor choice of rendezvous.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù Grine curtly retorted as he took a step back and observed his handiwork. ‚ÄúIt will be a perfect opportunity to conduct some tests!

The pod hissed loudly as pressurized gas escaped from its seals, filling the air with a noxious mist that stank of chemicals and decay. The reinforced glass frosted over, obscuring the monstrous shape within. A series of heavy metallic clunks echoed as the locks disengaged one by one.

Sabisstra strode over curiously, her spiked chain coiled around her armoured wrist as she glanced toward the stasis pod with disdain. ‚ÄúGrine, if this is another one of your unstable disasters‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt unstable,‚Äù Grine snapped back angrily, before his voice dripped with a rare hint of arrogant pride. ‚ÄúThis work is merely a fraction of my genius!‚Äù

Slarah, stationed near the doorway, tightened her grip on her staff, her sharp eyes narrowing as the temperature seemed to drop. ‚ÄúWhatever that thing is, make sure it doesn‚Äôt turn on us.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it won‚Äôt...‚Äù Grine chuckled darkly as he made sure to challengingly lock eyes with each of them. ‚ÄúNot unless I tell it to‚Ä¶‚Äù

The final lock disengaged with a deafening clang, and the pod‚Äôs glass door swung outward with a groan. A massive hammer-like hand shot out, gripping the edge of the pod and leaving deep gouges in the reinforced metal.

The creature within stepped forward, its form monstrous and grotesque. It stood nearly seven feet tall, its heavily muscled body covered in pale, veiny flesh with clear signs of invasive surgery and fleshwarping. Its elongated skull was crowned with jagged spines, and its eyes glowed with a sickly green light. Its chest pulsed with an eerie, rhythmic glow, as though a reactor powered its mutated heart. Tubes of chemical fluids snaked across its back, feeding into ports embedded in its flesh, which ripped out in a gush of many-coloured fluids as it stood at attention.

‚ÄúMy close contact with the Outsider gave me‚Ä¶insights,‚Äù Grine coldly announced as he observed several of the other pods opening, revealing other mutated monstrosities, many looking different, some even flawed, but all strong in their own way. ‚ÄúAnd House Mal‚ÄôKar gave me the resources in a trade, including some very interesting Outsider blood samples I‚Äôve utilized in my research, though sadly there was not enough for everything I had planned...‚Äù

The creatures turned their glowing eyes toward Grine, who gave a sharp command.¬†

‚ÄúTarget the invaders,‚Äù he coldly sneered. ‚ÄúTear them apart.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúWait for my signal,‚Äù Kull growled a whisper over comms with a toothy grin. ‚ÄúLet them come. *Oh yes Captain, just like old times‚Ä¶*‚Äù

Several of the unknown figures reached a bottleneck in the ruins, a narrow street littered with debris and flanked by crumbling walls. Kull raised his hammer high, and with a sharp, guttural cry, brought it crashing down on a section of the overpass he had been hiding behind.

With a thunderous roar, the structure collapsed, sending tons of rubble down onto the cultists below. Yells erupted as the debris crushed several in an instant, breaking their advance.

‚ÄúAttack now!‚Äù Kull roared, leaping from the crumbling edge of the overpass. He descended like a meteor, his hammer glowing with green magical energy as he smashed it into the head of the first standing cultist he had aimed for, the woman‚Äôs body reduced to bloody ash and shattered metal as the hammer released a mighty concussive blast of energy that knocked several others down from the force.¬†

‚ÄúCome!‚Äù Kull roared out into the darkness with pure battle-fueled glee. ‚ÄúCome and kill me if you can!‚Äù

Defenders emerged from hidden positions in the rubble, firing down on the cultists. Energy weapons flared, grenades detonated, and in just a few seconds, the battle began and immediately descended into chaos.

Kull wasted no time as he moved through the enemy ranks. A cultist charged him with a crackling plasma blade, only for Kull to intercept the swing with his hammer, smashing the man fully in the ribs and sending him flying, his weapon shattering on impact.¬†

Suddenly there was a loud whining sound as a large, hulking figure launched itself at Kull from the side, narrowly missing his head with the bloody, arm-mounted chainsword they had attacked with. Kull sidestepped with deceptive agility, his eyes widening as he saw the bolted metal plate covering the face of his attacker, and as they turned for another attack, the veteran saw the rest of the gruesome cybernetics of the Cyberzombie as they revved up the chaingun bolted to their other limb.¬†

‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt!‚Äù Kull snarled as he used his momentum to close the distance and bring his warhammer up in a devastating uppercut. The cyberzombie‚Äôs torso cracked and buckled under the blow, sparks and fluids spraying as it crumpled to one knee, and Kull snarled as he struck again and again, the powerful magic of his hammer keeping the cyberzombie down as it fought to stand up, still alive.¬†

More cultists closed in, firing wildly as they charged. Kull raised his free hand, activating a personal energy shield that deflected incoming rounds with a ripple of light. He snarled and charged, sweeping his hammer in a wide arc that sent bodies flying like ragdolls.

‚ÄúIs that all you‚Äôve got!‚Äù He yelled out in a challenge, standing atop a mound of rubble, his chest heaving as he surveyed the carnage. Around him lay the broken remains of several of the intruders, and Kull spat in disgust at spotting the symbol of the burning skull on one of the bodies, illuminated by the glow of his warhammer, along with the blood and oil staining the ground.¬†

A single shot rang out.

The bullet struck Kull‚Äôs shoulder plate, piercing the edge of his armor and grazing his scaled flesh. Barely feeling the hit, he snarled and turned his gaze upward, scanning the jagged rooftops for the source.

On a crumbled building overlooking the battlefield, he spotted a pale figure with long, silvery hair perched with a sniper rifle in hand. The Wight‚Äôs gaunt face grinned widely, skin stretching taught over her angular bones as her eyes gleamed with an eerie yellow light.¬†

‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre having fun!‚Äù The Trickster called out, her voice laced with mockery. ‚ÄúI like to have fun too! It‚Äôs a rush I‚Äôll never get bored of! I feel alive again! COME ON!‚Äù

Kull roared in rage at the mockery and leapt from his position, charging across the battlefield with terrifying speed for his size that surprised the cocky Trickster. She fired again, her well-honed reflexes allowing her to land a clean, accurate shot, The high-powered round struck Kull‚Äôs knee, denting his armor and causing him to stumble mid-stride.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need more than that to stop me, corpse!‚Äù Kull bellowed, his eyes narrowing as he pressed forward. ‚Äú*Oh yes, Captain! Yes she will!‚Äù*

‚ÄúFine by me!‚Äù The Trickster cackled as she fired again, though Kull dodged this time as he closed the distance. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt doing anything down there!‚Äù

Kull grinned, showing his sharp reptilian teeth, a motion that made the Trickster stop for a moment, before Kull used his momentum and threw the hammer as hard as he could straight towards the Wight. The hammer flew much faster and higher than the Trickster predicted, and it was only through her long unlife of experience that she dodged at the last moment.¬†

‚ÄúMissed!‚Äù She mocked. ‚ÄúYou- OH FUCK!‚Äù She lept back as suddenly, Kull blinked up the roof, his hand firmly around the haft of the hammer, which he pulled out of the wall before he¬† followed through with another swipe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be over in one good hit!‚Äù Kull snarled as he refused to let up. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter if you have a phylactery to bring you back! I‚Äôll kill you again and again so hard your remains won‚Äôt even be worth skullfucking! *Oh yes Captain, yes I will‚Ä¶*‚Äù

The Trickster slung her rifle over her shoulder and swiftly drew a pair of finely crafted heavy pistols, no longer cocky, keeping her distance as she peppered Kull with rapid fire. Bullets struck his armour and ricocheted off his energy shield, though if any of them did any damage, Kull didn‚Äôt show it. The Trickster spun and ducked low to avoid a hammer blow, but cursed as she was forced to leap back to avoid a backswing that came far more quickly than she thought possible. The weapon clipped her, sending her sprawling across the debris-strewn rooftop.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù Kull snarled. ‚ÄúI thought you lived for this? Well. Not for long‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Trickster smirked, as a buzzing sound rang out from behind Kull, who just about spotted the drone zooming towards them before it smashed into the ground between them and exploded.¬†

The force of the shockwave rocked the battlefield, sending both combatants sprawling in opposite directions along the roof.¬†

The Trickster recovered first, her supernatural agility allowing her to roll to her feet. She spat a curse and glanced at Kull, who was shaking off the debris and readying himself for another charge.

‚ÄúSorry, big guy,‚Äù she called out, backing into the shadows, cackling as she fled. ‚ÄúAnother time, perhaps.‚Äù

Kull stood amidst the dissipating dust, his hammer still glowing with residual energy. His snarl deepened as he scanned the ruined streets, but there was no sign of The Trickster.

‚ÄúCoward‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered, planting his hammer against the ground.

\*\*\*\*\*

‚ÄúPathetic! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath snarled as he shrugged off the torrent of plasma rounds sent his way. With a guttural growl, he levelled his twin gattling blasters and unleashed a barrage of fire that easily churned the concrete cover the mercenaries were hiding behind, obliterating the hiding soldiers moments later.¬†

One brave warrior charged Skitterdeath from above with a vibro-spear in an attempt to disrupt his cybernetics, but Skitterdeath lashed out, snapping it in half with barely a flick of one of his lightning claws before stabbing the defender fully in the torso with the other, lifting him effortlessly before slamming him into the nearest wall with bone-shattering force.¬†

‚ÄúZax! Where are they coming from? Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath hissed.

‚ÄúSubtle signs of power draw from underneath the large structure ahead!‚Äù An excitable voice chittered as the young face of a Lizta with pure-white fur, red eyes and a notched ear showed up on his HUD. ‚ÄúMatches the location my drones tracked those Regulators to! I mean hell, these guys were really well hidden, but it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm a super awesome hacker that-‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath snarled at the motormouth. ‚ÄúThey must be using a tunnel network. Find the entryways and mark them!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry! On it!‚Äù Zax quickly responded as they focused on piloting their legion of drones, marking targets for the cyberzombies.

Ahead, a barricade of rubble blocked Skitterdeath‚Äôs path, manned by several defenders who didn‚Äôt hesitate to send a volley of missiles streaking towards him. With surprising agility, he sidestepped one missile and simply swatted another aside with one of his claws, the resulting explosion barely slowing him down as he charged the barricade and lept, his massive frame crashing down on a soldier that failed to move in time, who he quickly dispatched with a point-blank volley of plasma-fire that bisected them from the head down. The defenders scattered, scrambling to regroup, but Skitterdeath was already upon them.

He lunged, slashing with his lightning claws, the energized blades cutting through steel and flesh alike as they dripped with blood and oil alike. Sparks and gore flew as he cleaved through a hastily-placed turret, bisecting the operator behind it in the same motion.

Another mercenary armed with a shoulder-mounted plasma cannon fired point-blank. The shot struck Skitterdeath square in the chest, sending a pulse of energy rippling across his armour. He staggered back a single step before snarling and charging forward, his blasters ripping the man apart in mere seconds.

Suddenly, the wall to his left exploded outward with a deafening roar, sending chunks of concrete and rebar flying in all directions as something smashed through with a loud, high-pitched scream, its massive fist swinging like a wrecking ball. The blow connected with a thunderous crack, sending Skitterdeath to smash into the side of a nearby crumbling building, shattering the wall on impact and causing a cascade of debris to drop down and bury him.

For a moment, all was still.¬†

Then the next moment, dust and debris suddenly exploded into the air as Skitterdeath burst out roaring in eager rage. ‚ÄúFinally, something worth killing! Kack!‚Äù

The creature roared and charged again, but this time, Skitterdeath was ready. He sidestepped the creature‚Äôs swing with supernatural speed as his claws sliced into its side, causing it to convulse violently as it staggered past him.¬†

The mutant retaliated with a desperate back swipe of its massive arm, but Skitterdeath ducked low, before slamming both claws upward into the creature‚Äôs torso, pumping it full of electricity.¬† The creature howled in pain as its flesh quickly began to boil and blacken, but before Skitterdeath could finish it, something big and fast slammed into him, forcing him to roll and rapidly recover as a second mutant made themselves known, a third following close behind.¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Skitterdeath roared, spreading his claws wide in a gesture of challenge. ‚ÄúThe Destroyer himself smiles upon me! You are nothing!‚Äù

The second mutant closed the gap, its bladed arms slicing through the air with a high-pitched whine. Skitterdeath dodged the initial swipe with uncanny speed, ducking under the razor-sharp arc and countering with a slash that raked across its midsection. The creature retaliated with a roaring backhand swing that caught Skitterdeath in the shoulder, spinning him to the side, but before it could follow up, Skitterdeath twisted and drove one claw upward through the beast‚Äôs stomach as he spooled up his gattling blaster, destroying the mutant from the inside out with a quick burst, before backpedalling quickly to avoid a hammer-like fist from the first one.

Detecting the sound of movement behind him, Skitterdeath quickly jumped at the nearest wall and kicked off of it. He saw the third strange mutant had lobbed something at him, the block of asphalt zipping underneath him as he closed the distance in a blur of motion. He juked the mutant as he got within its guard and tackled it to the ground before plunging both claws into its head, electricity quickly frying its brain before it collapsed, smoke rising from its shattered skull.¬†

The last one roared and charged, forcing Skitterdeath to brace himself, his claws crackling with energy as he met the creature head-on. The momentum of the impact sent him skidding back, but he held his ground as his claws locked with the mutant‚Äôs massive hands, before he suddenly drove his mechanical knee into the creature‚Äôs midsection, breaking the grapple and sending it reeling back, not from any pain, but just from the sheer strength of force.¬†¬†¬†

Advancing forward with a snarl, Skitterdeath launched himself at the mutant, his blasters firing at point-blank range. The bullets tore into the creature‚Äôs chest, stopping it from rushing back. He capitalized on the opening, slashing at its knees and bringing it to the ground before he lept onto its back and drove his claws deep into the creature‚Äôs spine. With a ferocious roar, he ripped upward with his claws, severing its spinal cord in a spattering of gore.¬†

‚ÄúKack!‚Äù Skitterdeath coughed as he walked away from the fresh carnage. ‚ÄúZax. Status?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever those weird things are, they‚Äôre slowing us down!‚Äù The Lizta warned. They‚Äôve taken out a bunch of the Cyberzombies and I‚Äôm having trouble tracking them! Don‚Äôt seem to be many, though!‚Äù

‚ÄúConverge on the target building, make them come to us!‚Äù He growled. ‚ÄúTake the-‚Äù

A sudden rush of air and the faint whistle of a descending object snapped his attention upward, his reflexes kicking in just in time to barely avoid the hammer aimed for his head, grazing off his snout as he stumbled back. His crimson eyes narrowed as he fixed his gaze on his attacker.¬†¬†

Master Kull stepped forward with a confident grin. ‚ÄúEnough games.‚Äù He sneered. ‚ÄúShould have known you‚Äôd be a bunch of Destroyer-tards.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou insult the Destroyer‚Äôs name?! His embrace awaits you, lizard! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath snarled as he extended his lightning claws, aggressive snapping sparks dancing between them.

Kull smirked, hefting his hammer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll break you long before that happens, vermin! *Oh yes Captain, oh yes we will‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Suddenly the Xarak dashed forward, swinging his hammer as Skitterdeath dogged to the side at the last moment, the weapon narrowly missing his shoulder, before retaliating with a lightning-fast slash of his claws, which was blocked by Kull bringing up his hammer in guard, before swinging again in a low sweep, forcing Skitterdeath to leap over the attack. The movement was almost graceful, but Kull anticipated the dodge and twisted his swing upward, catching Skitterdeath mid-air and sending him hurtling back.

With a snarl, Skitterdeath recovered quickly and surged forward, firing his gattling blasters at Kull, who raised his hammer like a shield, deflecting most of the shots, but though he was able to cover his face and torso, several burned through his shields and caught him in the sides and legs. Though he had the awareness to block a stab of the lightning claws, he was still knocked off balance as Skitterdeath slammed his shoulder into the reptile, followed up by another devastating claw swipe that caught Kull as he peddled back, dripping blood onto the cracked pavement. He swung his hammer in an arc, forcing Skitterdeath to pull back from his attack, though a backswing caught him in the chest with a mighty crack.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre strong,‚Äù Kull rumbled through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm stronger! Nobody can kill me!‚Äù Kull roared in a battle cry as he charged.¬†¬†

‚ÄúEven gods can die! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath sneered mockingly as he hit the ground running, his twin gattling guns honed in on the Xarak, before he was suddenly sent flying as a beam of shadowstuff blasted him off his feet.¬†

‚ÄúBack, beast,‚Äù Svaarzhul commanded, his voice a calm but menacing hiss.

Skitterdeath growled as he quickly picked himself up, roaring in frustration as he dug his claws into the ground to stop himself from being pushed further. ‚ÄúYet more meat to the slaughter? Kack!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should be honoured to die by my hand,‚Äù Svaarzhul mocked as he settled in a confident stance, flourishing his sword and staff, both looking like they were made of pure shadowstuff with the way they dulled and smoked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve found a worthy foe to really cut loose on‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Sabisstra called over comms. ‚ÄúWe need you to portal us out of here! Grine‚Äôs creatures are holding them off but there‚Äôs too many of them and we can‚Äôt afford the losses! We need to go!‚Äù

Svaarzhul hissed in genuine anger, but he agreed with the logic. ‚ÄúCockblocking bitch, you‚Äôre the reason they‚Äôre here!‚Äù He still muttered where only he could hear before he tapped his staff on the ground, whispering a few words under his breath, enveloping him and Kull in dark light for just a moment, before they both disappeared.¬†

‚ÄúNobody escapes the slaughterhouse! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath bellowed, lunging forward, but only scraping air. ‚ÄúGet to the vault entrance! Now!‚Äù He snarled.¬†

‚ÄúWe need to grab whatever information they have on the Outsider before they escape!‚Äù The Trickster warned in a hiss.¬†

‚ÄúNo problem TrickyWicky!‚Äù Zax cheerfully chimed in, as the large mechanical drone containing the protective sarcophagus of the techie walked up the road on six legs now the path was clear, quickly convening at the entrance of the building where two cyberzombies were stood aimlessly, unable to get past the fully sealed blast door. ‚ÄúUh, okay that might be a problem!‚Äù

‚ÄúOut of my way! Kack!‚Äù Skitterdeath snarled, with only the urgency of their mission staying his claws from tearing the young idiot apart as he strode up to the false wall panel that contained the keypad, not fooled in the slightest by the deception, before plunging his left claw into it, piercing through metal and circuitry with a sickening crunch, sparks flying from the panel as if it were protesting the intrusion.¬†

A harsh sizzle immediately filled the air as the flesh on his arm began to blacken and smoke, the acrid scent of burning fur and flesh mixing with the ozone tang of fried electronics as Skitterdeath didn‚Äôt even flinch. His red eyes narrowed in focus as lines of code crossed his vision, before forcing his will upon it to obey him.¬† He tilted his head, as if listening to the faint hum of the system‚Äôs internal workings. Then, with a sudden, forceful jerk of his charred and burned claw, the console let out a tortured screech, as with a low rumble, the blast doors began to slide open‚Ä¶

Her name used to be something else but my sister was 1 year old and called every cat ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù. But she couldn‚Äôt pronounce it right and it came out as ‚ÄúKiki‚Äù. 

She‚Äôs lost a lot of weight as she‚Äôs gotten older, she used to be chunky. You might be able to tell by the photos but she was real sassy. She can‚Äôt see but she‚Äôd bop the younger cats right in the head with a 6th sense. 

Her last few months were rough. She couldn‚Äôt hear, and she couldn‚Äôt see. She would walk around my grandmas house bumping into everything and that‚Äôs how she found her way. She‚Äôs get stuck in loops in the kitchen and bathroom. 

My grandma found a sore in her ear and told us she was going to the vet. I knew something else must‚Äôve been going on when my grandma urged me to come see her before she took her to the vet. I came to see her and gave her lots of love, the photos are from today actually. 

She texted after the appointment saying they had to put her down, because there was more than just an ear infection causing problems for her. Her quality of life would‚Äôve been horrible and she would‚Äôve been in pain. 

My grandma would do anything for her animals, and she had to tell herself that she would do this for her. Not to force her to be in pain, but to let her go peacefully. She had just been thinking all day how she wished Kiki would just lay down and pass at home so it didn‚Äôt have to happen at the vet. 

Kiki was loved, she‚Äôs been with me my whole life. Shes 2 years older than me and we have photos of her cuddling with both me and my sister as children. 

We recently lost another pet in the family, my aunts dog, Doc. I believe he might‚Äôve just barely been younger than me or barely older. His death hit my aunt hard, and my grandma who helped rescue him. Now she‚Äôs lost her cat and she‚Äôs been watching her other dog, Georgie, die slowly. It seems like there‚Äôs going to be a chain of deaths of the original pets in the family, and it‚Äôs unfortunate pets can‚Äôt live as long as we do. My grandma just recently found out kittens live outside her house. 

One of them being a cute little tabby. "

So I recently remembered I had an old bag of VET in a VeChainThor wallet from quite a few years back.  Once I located all the filed notes to access I decided to send some over to an exchange for kicks and potential liquidity once things potentially pick up a bit more.

For some reason when I try and do the transfer, add the address and amount, and then click next nothing happens.  When I look at the transaction page it says no internet connection, which is not the case.  Can‚Äôt seem to compete and transfer.  Any ideas as to what‚Äôs going on here?  Appreciate and insight or tips.

Cheers!

The Buzz on The Spin

He raps on the door with his back of his knuckles. He can sense her moving inside and lowers himself to the peephole so she looks him directly in the eye when she uses it. There are a few muttered words, likely curses, in a language he doesn‚Äôt know and the door is unlatched and opened.

‚ÄúBoo.‚Äù He says and the door is slammed shut. He smiles at that. It‚Äôs so nice to be recognized for his hard work. He waits a few moments before raising his voice. ‚ÄúYou may as well just speak to me, if you know enough to be afraid then you should know that running just means you‚Äôre already exhausted as I get to work on you.‚Äù

There is a bit more scuffling about and the door opens again. ‚ÄúHello Janice. We need to have a chat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis station isn‚Äôt in...‚Äù She begins to protest.

‚ÄúAny legally recognized territory of the surrounding polities, I know. This isn‚Äôt about them. If you want to send them a video of you shaking your ass at them and daring them to come get you we might have issues, emphasis on might, but you haven‚Äôt done that.‚Äù Hoagie says stepping into the Panseros‚Äô personal space and she hops back and falls to all fours to be more stable in her stance. He crouches down to her level. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here because your little stunt with the Agela spread into the station proper. Which makes it my problem, and if it‚Äôs my problem then it‚Äôs my business. So what the hell is going on, and what was in this?‚Äù

He reaches into his pocket and the expanded space within it to pull out the briefcase. She swallows at the sight of it. ‚ÄúWas it a weapon?‚Äù

‚Äú... Maybe? I was hired to intercept the package, check it for damage and then get it to the drop zone. I‚Äôm done, mission complete.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I get that... but I still need to know who hired you and what it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd all I know is that I was paid well to have memory problems about it. So no.‚Äù Janice says as she sits down on her haunches and he nods.

‚ÄúWell if your memory is that bad then you‚Äôve probably forgotten about these.‚Äù He says flashing some coins and her eyes track them.

‚ÄúHey, memory‚Äôs a funny thing. I‚Äôm not normally that forgetful.‚Äù She says.

‚ÄúWell the thing is is that I seem to have forgotten what‚Äôs yours and what I have forgotten.‚Äù Hoagie says as he starts shuffling some coins around in his hand. This girl is pure mercenary, meaning it‚Äôs all for sale. He pulls out a J‚ÄôHest coin and looks into it‚Äôs crystal structure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda funny that solid currency is so popular, but it makes sense when it‚Äôs a precious and practical thing that‚Äôs also beautiful.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, J‚ÄôHest is quite pretty.‚Äù She aggrees before looking away. ‚ÄúNot as pretty as what I remember though.‚Äù

He chuckles before reaching for her. He then pulls out a second J‚ÄôHest coin from behind her ear. ‚ÄúQuantity has it‚Äôs own quality. Is your memory jogging?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm... I remember... a big woman. Another Agela in The Posh Place.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what was so important?‚Äù Hoagie asks with a third coin spinning on top of the other two before it comes to rest on top of the tiny stack.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a toy, a child, or something else. But it was bigger on the inside and a lot of feathers got in the way. It was all stasis grey too.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm... very interesting. Where might I buy a toy like this? Exactly.‚Äù He asks her and she raises an eyebrow. A fourth coin joins the other three.

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

‚ÄúMore wine madam?‚Äù Her waiter asks of her and she smiles at him. Good food, good drink and a job well done pair amazingly. She drinks deeply of the treat and luxuriates as she waits for her food. There is a slight thumping sound and she opens her eyes to see a man in a garishly bright shirt sit down across from her.

‚ÄúSir, while I appreciate male company where I can get it, there is a certain standard around here.‚Äù She notes as she takes in the hints of sculpted muscle around his neck. Very important in a bull to have a strong neck.

‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm above it.‚Äù he says before placing a shining black briefcase on the table. ‚ÄúYour assassin missed this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She demands.

‚ÄúYour little hired killer forgot the case behind and just got you the product. I figured you wanted to complete the set.‚Äù He says before waving at the waiter. He shows some kind of badge and makes an order too low and fast for her to track. ‚ÄúSo, are we going to talk as to what you think you‚Äôre doing and why I should let you get away with it?‚Äù

‚Äú... You‚Äôre not going to try and arrest me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving you a chance to explain yourself and talk me out of using you to repaint the outer hull.‚Äù He says blithely and she wrinkles her nose at the base threat. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt mistake the threat for an idle one, your life is very much in your hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really think it wise to threaten me?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think it wise to interfere with such a valuable trade on a pirate station? Stunts like that damage our reputation and that‚Äôs tied directly to our profit lines. Putting aside the morals of what you‚Äôve done, you‚Äôre going to cost us a great deal of money in the long term. So please, tell me, is it wise to come into ungoverned space between polities where the pirates you‚Äôve now cost money make the law?‚Äù

She says nothing as he is handed a menu and starts to scan it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to hear the sound of my own voice Miss Fallows.‚Äù

She glares at him.

‚ÄúYou have five minutes to tell me what it is you‚Äôve stolen from the now murdered Miss Cooror. I want to know what it is, and why you think it‚Äôs worth having someone killed for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe you‚Äôve been misled. I only wanted the package. I said nothing about murder.‚Äù She says and he looks up at her from the menu.

‚Äú... Either you‚Äôre stupid or you think I am. I‚Äôve already spoken with Janice. The fun thing about mercenaries is that they can be bought, and the smart ones know who the local powers are and work with them. Better for the bottom line, not to mention the health benefits.‚Äù

‚ÄúHealth benefits?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, rampant assassins unwilling to give up their employers tend to find themselves coming down with a bad case of decompression.‚Äù Hoagie remarks and she scoffs.

‚ÄúOh please, I doubt you‚Äôve ever so much as slapped a woman in your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss Fallows, I‚Äôm trying to avoid staining this lovely room with your blood. It really doesn‚Äôt matter what type it is, you need to put in WORK to get body fluids out of carpets like the ones here.‚Äù Hoagie says as he smirks and puts the menu down. ‚ÄúHmm... they‚Äôre seriously upcharging here. At least the presentation on the food is good, otherwise it‚Äôd go from an upcharge to an outright scam.‚Äù

He smirks at her. ‚ÄúGood thing we‚Äôre attached to a Casino isn‚Äôt it? Otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be anything borderline about the theft.‚Äù

She says nothing.

‚ÄúYou will tell me what is in that package, this is the last time I ask nicely. Blood, chaos and death has been sown on this station, and it‚Äôs been at your behest. I will hear why and for what, one way or another.‚Äù

She leans down until she towers almost directly over him. Her answer is a simple: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He smiles. ‚ÄúI was hoping you‚Äôd be stupid. Time for the fun part.‚Äù

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

‚ÄúRight, so while Protn is the best when it comes to making instant communication between devices, when they‚Äôre at this close range, radio waves are more than enough to link things up, and if things are in a predictable pattern lasers work too. So long as you can reliably get the beam and sensors to be paired up constantly, something that‚Äôs surprisingly hard to do in the middle of a pitched fight.‚Äù Snarlmane explains to Dumiah as she shows off how the cannon links up t oher power armour.

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no real physical connection? Wouldn‚Äôt a wire be more reliable? Maybe a dataport with a magnetic clamp?‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot of girls swear by them, but I‚Äôve seen them fail and made them fail too many times to trust them.‚Äù Snarlmane remarks. The big woman was completely unconcerned with her place in things. Like all Cannidor she knew where she was on any food-chain she was a part of. Right at the top.

‚ÄúMaybe, but if learning advanced weapon tech has taught me anything it‚Äôs that people don‚Äôt reinforce things enough. If you can‚Äôt beat your opponent to death with the weapon in a pinch then it‚Äôs been made to shoddy standards and isn‚Äôt going to last in any kind of fight or even sustained use.‚Äù Dumiah counters.

‚ÄúSad but true. If your weapon isn‚Äôt a one time use device then it needs reinforcement as a general rule.‚Äù Snarlmane says.

Observer Wu is writing down the details at just how casually that Snarlmane has been accepted and the blond furred woman notices. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs with mister scribbles over there?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is Observer Wu. Basically things in Cruel Space are so different compared to the rest of the galaxy that the politicians, big wigs and other bank-roller types flat out disbelieve the reports sent home. He‚Äôs basically a vetted and trusted source to see what‚Äôs really going on. What he‚Äôs been seeing is that The Undaunted have been underselling what the galaxy is like to make it easier to understand.‚Äù Harold explains.

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs going to go over well now isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the man drink like he doesn‚Äôt want to be in this reality anymore. To say nothing of the horrifying side effects on the careers and dreams that this revelation will have on those poor helpless politicians.‚Äù Harold says with a straight face. Then smirks as Snarlmane turns to look right at him.

‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs alright with letting non-humans on the same ship as him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is, mostly because he knows that the girls are tied to me. Either as employees, or family. And he needs some level of Axiom capable security. The crew is under some pretty wild restraints and limitations in order to be considered ‚Äòuncompromised‚Äô by Earth. They vary from soldier to soldier, but mostly they need to stay a good chunk of the way out of The Axiom unless given approval by a trusted source. Thankfully Wu has started the process of getting them catching up. But let‚Äôs be honest, if a girl of the galaxy really wants to be somewhere or know something there‚Äôs about a trillion ways she can get it and not even half so many ways to stop her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is why he has you around, you‚Äôre a deterrent.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore a consequence, I can see through most infiltration methods like they don‚Äôt even exist and I have no problem tying someone up and dragging them right to The Captain or Observer Wu for judgement. I‚Äôve also been training up security and Intelligence as well as answering any and all questions that they care to ask.‚Äù Harold explains.

‚ÄúSome days the researchers and scientists refuse to leave him alone.‚Äù Giria notes calmly.

‚ÄúYeah, knowing I‚Äôm more informed than them in several fields while also less than a year old is throwing them pretty badly, they don‚Äôt fully know what to make of a clone.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut clones happen in nature a great deal, twins are well known in all species.‚Äù Snarlmane says.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct, but the idea is slow to sink in.‚Äù Harold says before picking up the drink can he had been draining and throwing the rest back. ‚ÄúRight, that‚Äôs a few hundred extra calories and stimulants. Anyone have anything they want to do in particular?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have an idea!‚Äù Javra says.

‚ÄúAnd that is?‚Äù

‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

A blue skinned woman who is perhaps three and a half feet tall, with silvery white hair and bright glowing yellow eyes, SLAMS into the central body of a Lydris and forces her through the water. A bubble of conjured and controlled atmosphere around her. The gigantic main claws swat at her as a series of Axiom infused darts are launched at her and she pumps her dark wings to fly away from the retaliation.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs one way to have your fun. I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to go into monster hunting withdrawal.‚Äù Snarlmane notes.

‚ÄúConsidering that I can feel myself go into combat withdrawal after just a couple days without a brawl I understand her situation completely. If this isn‚Äôt enough I‚Äôll rent a shuttle and see if she can‚Äôt fill the void trying to fight a space ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat world breeds Metak so vicious they‚Äôre literally addicted to fighting leviathan class lifeforms?‚Äù Snarlmane asks in amusement.

‚ÄúLakran.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt narrow it down!‚Äù

‚ÄúSure it does.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, yes, but not enough. I‚Äôve been to eight different worlds named Lakran, and if we count nations, stations and ships I‚Äôve been to thousands of Lakrans.‚Äù Snarlmane protests.

‚ÄúJust a few thousand? You don‚Äôt get out much do you?‚Äù Giria teases and Umah snorts.

‚ÄúMind moving to the side for a moment hubby?‚Äù Snarlmane asks and Harold steps out of the way with a big smile on his face. Snarlmane then dives onto the already ready Giria and Umah.

‚ÄúSo does this make me the calm and reasonable one?‚Äù Dumiah asks.

‚ÄúBy default no less.‚Äù Harold agrees.

I‚Äôve played around ten or games since the codex launched with different lists and units in the Imperialis Fleet and I have found the following things in my experience to be true:
-Breachers require a lot of assistance to be effective.  They are 15 points cheaper than Deathwatch vets and 35 points more than voidsmen.  I would rather have a low maintenance unit that is more durable and hits harder with vets or a cheaper chaff unit with voidsmen.  
- sisters of battle and the Immolator combo for 200 points doesn‚Äôt beat out a 10 men deathwatch vet squad for the points in my previous games.  Meltas are good against elite infantry but the low volume of shots doesn‚Äôt help when punching up against vehicles.  
-  Rhinos are awesome and likely our best vehicle.  Not sure how to feel about that.  Armigers are required as a big knight tends to get focused fire down and we need something that punches against t10 and higher stuff.
-  Rouge Traders are a good tech piece when leading a unit.  Bringing back chaff,  using the displacer field strat,  free infiltrate,  and a redeploy on infiltrating units or armigers. 
- Using the navigator unit with deep strike to turn off points helps us stay in the primary game.  He is a small single unit that has a hard to screen out.  
- Taking one assassin,  normally the Callidus,  is worth it.  Multiple assassins is risky.  Taking one at 110 gives you the ability to tech in the best one for the match up. 
- The Corvus is overpriced trash,  but it can nab points and do secondaries with the acquire at all costs detachment rule and can move fast enough to flip points in hover mode.
- Grey Knight Terminators in a five man squad just don‚Äôt move fast enough to be relevant after the turn they rapid ingress. 
- The Watchmaster is good on a brick of 10 vets as a disruptive unit.  I don‚Äôt normally run big units for consistency,  but the flexibility of the Watchmaster makes this unit a high priority target so other units can flourish.  
- Artemis solo is a good back field objective holder as he is annoying to kill and a low priority target.  He can overwatch deep strikers and hold his own in combat.  
- Draxus is great for using firing deck in a rhino and when she disembarks leading a unit,  she can use displacer field to jump away 6 to stay out of 18 inch range to keep her unit alive.
- Your opponent will always take assassinate.  The army is character heavy by design and it is just an open liability you have to play around. 
- Subductors are good but I can get invulnerable saves from displacer fields or the detachment rule and need more damage output. 


My game plan with this list is normally the following:

-pick the appropriate assassin with shadow operations 
- put draxus with a five man deathwatch unit and another five man in the rhino
-infiltrate 10 man with watch master and another five man
- keep both navigators with deepstrike.  Occasionally give deepstrike to the RTE and voidsmen.
-redeploy or pull back to SR armigers or infiltrating deathwatch post deployment.
-two five man vet units in the Corvus or run it empty to pick up units too far out of the fight or in danger.
- Artemis on the back field objective.

Love to get your experiences and insight.  Thanks in advance to those that took the time to read this. "
She called the police. ,motherinlawsfromhell,1hch8qj,2024-12-12 04:14:25,173,0.98,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1hch8qj/she_called_the_police/,General_Error_8215,,"I need to vent. I‚Äôve been following for a bit now and I have found so much relief and comfort knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in this situation from this group. Thank you guys. Seriously. 

Background:
I‚Äôm not white. His family is from a holler in Kentucky. His father has made racist remarks. His mother is a textbook narcissist with lots of emotional incest towards my boyfriend. We‚Äôve had issues in the past that we just left alone for the sake of keeping the peace. A little over a year ago, he decided to go low contact. Several things happened that led up to it. After letting them know with so much respect I felt pride that he was standing up for himself so maturely, they IMMEDIATELY went into talking shit about me. They dragged my name through the mud and constantly messaged him saying vile things. I never fought back. If you know me, you would know that I ALWAYS fight for myself. I worked hard to be the woman I am and I take a lot of pride in it. But I didn‚Äôt say anything even when his mom and sister called me names and harassed me for his sake. I love him, and his peace came first. It was a huge step for him and I wanted to support him. After a month of the harassment, he contacted them and said no contact until they genuinely apologized to me for blaming me and all saying the nasty shit they did. Since then, nonstop calls and text. Manipulation like you wouldn‚Äôt believe and guilt trips to try to get him to talk. So many threats of just showing up. 

Alright. Fast forward to today. I had an awful couple of weeks. 2 sick dogs and 4 emergency vet trips. Late nights taking care of them AND finishing my finals. To say I was exhausted is an understatement. Today was the first day I felt like I actually had some time. I wanted to cook dinner for my family. As soon as I got done and was ready to plate, there was a knock at my door. The police fucking showed up. His mother called a wellness check for him because apparently they‚Äôre convinced I have him chained to a radiator because there is no way their precious baby boy would stand up for me over them. He hasn‚Äôt answered her calls and texts so she calls the police?
I don‚Äôt even have the words. It was a rough night. He‚Äôs so upset he couldn‚Äôt go to bed till now and he has to be up in a couple of hours for work. He called him mom immediately and for the first time, he let it out. After hanging up, he was absolutely distraught realizing his own mom would stoop so low. Thank God the cop quickly realized that the call was made for nefarious reasons and left as soon as possible. She put us all in danger. What if my dogs ran out and the cop got nervous and drew his weapon? What if I or he answered the door with a weapon because it was dark out and no one should be here this late? I‚Äôm so mad. His younger sister made sure to text me to call me a bitch and him a lowlife. I don‚Äôt know how the hell I keep getting dragged into something I haven‚Äôt even spoken a word about. I‚Äôve never dealt with such vile people. "

Suspended Amazon Account ‚Äì Reinstate & Reactivate Amazon Seller Accounts,ReinstateAmazonSeller,1hc6qld,2024-12-11 18:01:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReinstateAmazonSeller/comments/1hc6qld/suspended_amazon_account_reinstate_reactivate/,AretoInc,,"https://preview.redd.it/elailvwjva6e1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=817db1b8e37f65f67954304cad1c5215e2a68e41

Facing an Amazon account suspension? Our comprehensive guide walks you through every step of the reinstatement process, from understanding suspension triggers to crafting effective appeal strategies. Learn from industry experts at¬†[Areto](https://aretoinc.com/)¬†about proven methods to not only recover your suspended account but also implement robust prevention strategies for long-term Amazon selling success..



The nightmare scenario for any Amazon seller has just become reality ‚Äì your seller account is suspended. In today‚Äôs e-commerce landscape, where Amazon represents a significant portion of online retail sales, a suspended account can mean the difference between thriving business operations and complete shutdown. However, with proper guidance and strategic approach, account reinstatement is not only possible but can lead to stronger business practices.



# Understanding the Impact of Amazon Suspension

When Amazon suspends a seller account, the effects ripple through every aspect of the business. Immediate revenue loss is just the beginning ‚Äì suspended sellers face frozen inventory in Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers, damaged customer relationships, and potential long-term reputation impacts. According to¬†[Areto](https://aretoinc.com/), a leading Amazon consulting firm, the average seller loses thousands of dollars for each day their account remains suspended. This situation demands immediate, professional attention to minimize losses and restore selling privileges.

# Common Suspension Triggers

Amazon‚Äôs commitment to customer satisfaction drives its strict enforcement of marketplace rules. The most frequent suspension triggers include performance metric violations, product authenticity concerns, and policy breaches. One particularly challenging aspect is that sellers often violate policies unknowingly. For instance, a supplier might provide inauthentic goods without the seller‚Äôs knowledge, or listing optimizations might accidentally violate Amazon‚Äôs strict guidelines.

# The Critical First 24 Hours

The actions taken immediately following a suspension notification can significantly impact the reinstatement timeline. Professional¬†[Amazon account management](https://aretoinc.com/amazon-full-account-management/)¬†services recommend a systematic approach within the first 24 hours. This includes securing all relevant documentation, analyzing performance metrics, and beginning the draft of your Plan of Action (POA). Quick action demonstrates to Amazon your commitment to resolving the situation.

# Case Study: The Multi-ASIN Suspension

Consider the case of a home goods seller who faced suspension due to multiple ASIN violations. Working with¬†[Amazon suspension appeal specialists](https://aretoinc.com/amazon-suspension-appeal-reinstatement/), they discovered that their supplier had modified product specifications without notice, leading to listing inaccuracies. The resolution involved implementing a robust supplier verification system and regular listing audit procedures. Their account was reinstated within 12 days, and they‚Äôve maintained perfect metrics since.

# Crafting an Effective Plan of Action

Your Plan of Action must be comprehensive yet concise. The document should include:

# Root Cause Analysis

A detailed investigation into what led to the suspension is crucial. For instance, if customer complaints triggered the suspension, analyze every aspect of your fulfillment process, from inventory management to shipping procedures.

# Immediate Corrective Actions

Document specific steps already taken to address the issues. This might include removing problematic listings, updating inventory systems, or implementing new quality control measures.

# Long-term Prevention Strategy

Outline systematic changes to prevent future violations.¬†[Amazon services](https://aretoinc.com/amazon-services/)¬†experts recommend focusing on sustainable, scalable solutions rather than quick fixes.

# The Appeal Process Decoded

The appeal process requires patience and precision. Amazon‚Äôs internal teams review thousands of appeals daily, making it crucial for yours to stand out through clarity and completeness. Successful appeals typically go through multiple rounds of review, with each revision providing an opportunity to strengthen your case.

# Performance Metrics Deep Dive

Understanding Amazon‚Äôs performance metrics is crucial for prevention and reinstatement. Key metrics include:

# Order Defect Rate (ODR)

The target should be below 1%. This encompasses negative feedback, A-to-z guarantee claims, and credit card chargebacks.

# Late Shipment Rate

Keep this below 4%. Implementing robust shipping procedures and working with reliable carriers is essential.

# Valid Tracking Rate

Maintain above 95%. This metric directly impacts customer satisfaction and account health.

# Prevention Strategies for Long-term Success

Prevention remains the best strategy against suspension.¬†[Amazon listing optimization](https://aretoinc.com/amazon-listing-optimization/)¬†services can help maintain compliant, high-performing listings. Regular account audits, performance monitoring, and proactive customer service are essential components of a prevention strategy.

# Starting Fresh: New Account Considerations

In some cases, sellers might consider starting fresh with a new account.¬†[Amazon new account setup](https://aretoinc.com/amazon-new-account-set-up/)¬†services can help ensure compliance from day one. However, this approach requires careful consideration and should only be pursued under professional guidance to avoid potential complications with Amazon‚Äôs policies.

# Case Study: The IP Complaint Resolution

A fashion accessories seller faced suspension due to intellectual property complaints. Through careful documentation and supplier verification, they proved their products‚Äô authenticity. The process involved:

* Obtaining manufacturer certificates
* Implementing rigorous supplier vetting
* Creating a trademark infringement prevention system
* Establishing relationships with brand registry teams

# Advanced Prevention Techniques

Successful sellers implement sophisticated prevention systems:

# Inventory Management

Implement systems that automatically flag potential issues before they trigger Amazon‚Äôs alerts.

# Customer Service Excellence

Develop proactive customer service protocols that address issues before they escalate to complaints.

# Quality Control Systems

Create comprehensive quality control checkpoints throughout your supply chain.

# The Role of Professional Management

Professional Amazon account managers bring expertise that can prevent suspensions and expedite reinstatement. They understand Amazon‚Äôs evolving policies and can implement effective compliance strategies.

# Building a Resilient Amazon Business

Success on Amazon requires more than just avoiding suspensions. It demands creating sustainable business practices that support long-term growth. This includes:

* Diversifying product lines safely
* Building strong supplier relationships
* Implementing scalable operations systems
* Maintaining detailed documentation

# Legal Considerations and Brand Protection

Understanding Amazon‚Äôs legal framework helps protect your business. This includes:

* Trademark compliance
* Patent verification
* Copyright adherence
* Brand registry participation

# The Future of Amazon Selling

As Amazon continues to evolve, sellers must adapt their practices. This includes embracing new technologies, understanding changing customer expectations, and maintaining agility in business operations.

# Conclusion

Account suspension, while challenging, doesn‚Äôt have to mean the end of your Amazon selling journey. With proper guidance, strategic planning, and professional support from experienced partners like¬†[Areto](https://aretoinc.com/), sellers can navigate the reinstatement process successfully and emerge stronger.

Remember that maintaining a healthy Amazon account requires constant vigilance and adaptation to changing marketplace requirements. Whether you‚Äôre currently facing suspension or working to prevent one, investing in professional Amazon services and implementing robust business practices will help ensure your long-term success on the platform.

The key to Amazon success lies in viewing suspension prevention and account management as ongoing processes rather than one-time fixes. By maintaining high standards in all aspects of your operation and staying current with Amazon‚Äôs evolving requirements, you can build a resilient and profitable Amazon business that stands the test of time.

[The Department of Energy‚Äôs loan office is more popular than ever | Latitude Media](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/the-department-of-energys-loan-office-is-more-popular-than-ever)

[Image credit: Lisa Martine Jenkins \(Photo credit: Department of Energy\)](https://preview.redd.it/tpc5h67ni76e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cfabe68c5b16cf7bca520c551cfeb7bf46684f5)

As of this week, the Department of Energy‚Äôs Loan Programs Office has finalized 14 loans since director Jigar Shah‚Äôs tenure began in 2021. Four of those closings took place in the month before the election, and four in the month since.¬†

Another 19 loans are in the conditional commitment stage, meaning DOE has signaled its intent to finance a project, but that the requirements for cash to be doled out haven‚Äôt yet been met.¬†Five of those were announced in the last month.

Those deals ‚Äî both finalized and announced ‚Äî add up to just under $55 billion in project investments.¬†

And the number of deals and dollars going out the door isn‚Äôt going unnoticed. Last week, Republicans on the Hill sent Shah a¬†[cease and desist letter](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/12_04_2024_Letter_to_DOE_LPO_a32b1c36aa.pdf), accusing the office of ‚Äúscambling to close deals‚Äù and citing its ramp up in projects post-election.¬†

‚ÄúOn election day, the American people rejected the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs rush-to-green agenda,‚Äù the letter, authored by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said. ‚ÄúWe insist that the Biden-Harris administration cease its campaign to quickly distribute federal funding before the incoming administration takes office.‚Äù

But the letter mischaracterizes what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs certainly true that loans are being signed and finalized at a quicker pace than in prior quarters or years. As the letter noted, the office has closed four loans in less than a month ‚Äî after finalizing ten total earlier in the administration. And LPO staff are working around the clock to get them out, to the tune of 75-hour weeks.

However, the pressure and urgency is flooding¬†*into*¬†the office, not emanating from it. As conversations at Deploy last week made clear, the rush is not that of the outgoing Biden administration, but from the private sector.

Hundreds of companies already in the office‚Äôs application pipeline, the majority of whom applied long before the election, turned up at the Walter E. Washington convention center last week for the second annual conference focused on investment in clean energy tech. The event recorded a 200% attendance jump over last year. Even the registration line alone, which stretched for more than an hour and a half on day one, suggested that these companies are eager to be a part of this LPO‚Äôs final, ferocious months ‚Äî and aren't sure that the support that the office has offered will be around come January.

# Private sector pressure

Despite the GOP lawmakers‚Äô alarm, the clock didn‚Äôt start for LPO on election day.¬†

The office has in fact been ramping up¬† since this summer, working to finalize as much as possible before January, even in the case of a Harris change-over. That‚Äôs in part because even a new Harris administration would inevitably result in some lost momentum in the office as key players use the transition as an opportunity to pursue work elsewhere in the administration, or beyond.

The private sector is nudging the process faster as well. Just a few months ago, it often took six months or longer for LPO to get signed documents back from applicants, many of whom weren‚Äôt fully prepared for the office‚Äôs rigorous vetting process, and who often wanted to negotiate terms of the offered loans.¬†

(LPO loan terms, though not publicly disclosed, are set by Treasury and are not negotiable. They are, however, significantly more favorable than other types of financing, several recipients confirmed to¬†*Latitude Media.*)

Now though, companies and their non-LPO investors are eager to finalize deals before the inevitable slowdown ‚Äî if not rollback ‚Äî that a new administration backed by a GOP-majority in Congress will bring. In the weeks since the election, companies in LPO‚Äôs pipeline have been turning around their paperwork in record time, without attempting to negotiate terms. Some are even following up to ask just how quickly things can be finalized.

The pace of LPO‚Äôs financing process is ‚Äúultimately up to the borrowers,‚Äù Shah told reporters at Deploy. Post-election, would-be LPO borrowers are motivated to move more quickly than they were in the early years of Biden‚Äôs term, he added. ‚ÄúOur process hasn't changed. Their ability to move through it faster is in their control.‚Äù

That increased urgency is also evident in the office‚Äôs remaining pipeline of active applications, i.e. for projects that have not yet been offered conditional commitments. In November 2023, LPO reported 125 active applications, totalling $174.7 billion. By last month, the office had 212, totalling $324.3 billion.

The makeup of sectors seeking LPO funding has also shifted dramatically, even in the last year. In January 2024, it was virtual power plant companies that were requesting the most funding, followed by renewables development, transmission, and clean fuels. By November, renewables development moved into the top spot, closely followed by advanced nuclear.¬†

# The bounds of the process

The process of receiving a loan from LPO is an arduous one. It inevitably takes several months from start to finish, regardless of how eager an applicant may be.¬†

‚ÄúThere is no way that you would choose the Loan Programs Office if you could easily get money out of the commercial markets,‚Äù Shah explained. ‚ÄúOur process is always going to be more difficult, more bureaucratic.‚Äù

Nancy Loewe, CFO of¬†[finalized loan recipient CelLink](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-362-million-loan-cellink-support-domestic), agreed. If the company could have gotten financing for their Texas manufacturing facility elsewhere, she said, they certainly would have. ‚ÄúI really tried to find alternatives because I was trying to avoid \[the LPO process\]‚Äù Loewe added. ‚ÄúBut the terms on this are undeniable.‚Äù

For instance, LPO gives CelLink a so-called ‚Äúpayment holiday‚Äù before it must start repaying the loan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly when a small company like ours needs it,‚Äù she explained. Alternative equipment financing options that the company considered required repayment starting within a year.¬†

‚ÄúWe need the funding to last a couple years while we build out the factory, and that‚Äôs where I think the DOE is invested long-term,‚Äù Loewe said. CelLink‚Äôs $362 million loan took nearly a year to finalize after receiving a conditional commitment in May 2023.

There is no way that you would choose the Loan Programs Office if you could easily get money out of the commercial markets. Our process is always going to be more difficult, more bureaucratic.Jigar Shah, director of DOE's Loan Programs Office

But loans being finalized this month are happening much more quickly. Entek, which received $1.3 billion to manufacture lithium-ion battery separators for EVs, finalized its loan in around six months. And loans are also moving from application to conditional commitments much more quickly.

That said, there‚Äôs a limit to how quickly the process can happen. Every loan approved by LPO must also be approved by the Energy Secretary, the White House Office of Management and Budget, and the Treasury Department, among others.¬†

And many companies applying for loans aren‚Äôt readily able to do the due diligence and reporting required by the office, or else don‚Äôt have the needed legal teams on retainer. As Allen Cadreau, founder and CEO of loan recipient Indian Energy put it: ‚ÄúLegal fees are a horse of another color. We‚Äôve gotta figure something out about that.‚Äù Indian Energy, he said, had seven different law firms vet the project over the course of three years to lock in the funding.

So loans that were already in the works as late as this summer could still be finalized before January 17, the Biden administration‚Äôs last working day. For those that have entered the pipeline in recent months, though, the outlook is more challenging.

# Prepping for a Trump LPO

Especially for companies that have received conditional commitments from LPO, a quiet effort to ‚ÄúTrump-proof‚Äù themselves is underway. The hope is that loans described in terms of domestic manufacturing or American innovation will be preserved despite the likely political upheaval to come.¬†

Between conditional commitments and finalized loans, LPO has agreed to around $55 billion in loans to 33 projects spanning battery production, nuclear, and virtual power plants. That amounts to just over an eighth of the office‚Äôs total $400 billion loan authority. (And the office has been pointed in its vocabulary throughout the Biden administration; you‚Äôd be hard put to find the words ‚Äúclimate‚Äù or ‚Äúgreen‚Äù anywhere in the office‚Äôs announcements or materials.)

But Project 2025, the conservative policy initiative from the Heritage Foundation and former Trump officials, calls for the Loan Programs Office to be eliminated entirely. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leads of the new Department of Government Efficiency, have said the office ‚Äî¬†[and its already-approved loans](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/12/03/ramaswamy-takes-aim-at-doe-loan-funds-00192326)¬†‚Äî are in their budget-cutting crosshairs.¬†

(Musk, incidentally, is one of the most prominent users of the Loan Programs Office, having¬†[borrowed $465 million](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla)¬†in the early days of Tesla for the company‚Äôs factory in Fremont, California. Tesla repaid its loan in full three years later.)The makeup of sectors seeking LPO funding has also shifted dramatically, even in the last year. In January 2024, it was virtual power plant companies that were requesting the most funding, followed by renewables development, transmission, and clean fuels. By November, renewables development moved into the top spot, closely followed by advanced nuclear.¬†

‚ÄúWe need the funding to last a couple years while we build out the factory, and that‚Äôs where I think the DOE is invested long-term,‚Äù Loewe said. CelLink‚Äôs $362 million loan took nearly a year to finalize after receiving a conditional commitment in May 2023.

Among the outstanding conditional commitments yet to be finalized are a $6.5 billion loan to help Rivian build a massive manufacturing facility in Georgia, and $9.2 billion for BlueOval SK LLC to build three plants to churn out electric vehicle batteries for Ford.

After Trump‚Äôs win, though, many loan recipients are already planning for how to engage with¬† the incoming administration.

Sustainable aviation fuel maker Gevo, for example,¬†[received a conditional commitment](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-gevo-net-zero-corn-starch-sustainable-aviation)¬†in October, but has been public about the fact that they won‚Äôt be able to finalize their $1.46 billion loan before Inauguration Day.

The delay, CEO Patrick Gruber told¬†*Latitude Media*, is largely on the Gevo side. Specifically, they need to shore up companion funding before finalizing the LPO dollars. He said¬† the company is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to finalize the loan.¬†

Gevo isn‚Äôt worried about the future of the loan, he added, given the fact that their South Dakota corn starch-to-jet fuel facility isn‚Äôt particularly partisan; in fact, last year, corn-state Republicans in the House made their support for increasing the debt limit contingent upon¬†[preserving biofuel tax credits](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3984389-ethanol-dispute-shows-power-of-regional-interests-in-narrow-gop-majority/)¬†extended by Democrats.

Other loan recipients are taking a different approach to keeping their heads down. The Grainbelt Express, for example,¬†[received a conditional commitment](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-grain-belt-express-construct-high-voltage-direct)¬†in November for up to nearly $5 billion to help build the high voltage, interregional transmission line. That project has been¬†[mired in partisan debate](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/the-midwests-transmission-backslide)¬†for several years now, and the company opted not to do any publicity for the LPO loan commitment, sticking only to the requisite announcement on LPO‚Äôs own site. Grainbelt Express‚Äôs website still does not include any mention of the loan.

# The Biden LPO‚Äôs legacy

Even companies that have their loans finalized ‚Äî and are ostensibly in a more secure position ‚Äî are doing some strategic planning. CelLink, for example, is taking its loan in tranches, and has currently taken just on $73 million installment, of the $362 million it has available.¬†

‚ÄúThat makes me nervous for next year, because who knows?‚Äù Loewe said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt take this away from us, but it does change our thought process in terms of making sure we‚Äôre only \[accepting\] what we really need. I don‚Äôt want to take on more government debt with the uncertainty of ‚Äòare the Republicans going to keep \[LPO\] or not‚Äô.‚Äù

Moving into 2025, CelLink is going to get ‚Äúvery creative‚Äù with equity raises, she added, to make sure the company only borrows from its LPO loan ‚Äúif we really have to.‚Äù

At the same time, Loewe said, LPO‚Äôs stamp of approval has given the company ‚Äúso much more credibility‚Äù with customers. In the months after finalizing CelLink‚Äôs loan in April, she said, they were able to sign a massive, multi-year deal that will ‚Äúfill our factory in Texas.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Holtec International is using a finalized LPO loan to restart an 800-megawatt nuclear generating station in Michigan. Pat O‚ÄôBrien, who leads the company‚Äôs government affairs, said that financing is already helping to de-risk nuclear energy even beyond their specific project. ‚ÄúIn the last two months, I‚Äôve had more financial institutions reach out to say ‚ÄòHey, can we just do a Q&A with you to ask about where nuclear is headed and what it is?‚Äô, because they‚Äôre getting interested,‚Äù he said.

Despite the furious conversations underway about¬† the future of the Department of Energy and¬†[unspent IRA funding](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/which-clean-energy-tax-credits-are-most-at-risk-under-trump)¬†more broadly, Shah is confident that the office‚Äôs impact will endure long-term.

""You won't know, obviously, until it's in the rearview mirror,"" he told¬†*Latitude Media*, ""but I really think that we have reset the way in which America commercializes innovation forever.""

# GIVEN BACK IN 2021 & THE TRAIL OF QUESTIONS WHEN ASKED- 

# Please see Jim's responses 6/17/2021-

**(Jim...Private funding methods have been the primary target however, ... can you offer any comment to the following questions.)**

**a) Does/Can Niocorp qualify for a U.S. govt. (DOE/DOD) Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described above or similar ?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

***""Quite possibly, and we are in discussions with them on this now. However, the ability of this program to fund critical minerals projects will depend upon what the Democratic leadership in Congress enacts in its appropriations bills, as new funding is required to cover the credit subsidy cost of these loans. In recent years, the Congressional appropriations process has been a very politically contentious with little bipartisan agreement on much of anything. Some opposition in the Congress has already quietly developed to the Administration‚Äôs proposal to expand this program‚Äôs traditional funding focus to include critical minerals mines, which it has not funded in the past. Regardless, it is not likely that funding levels for the credit subsidies used by these programs will be finalized until late this year, or into next year.***

***I will add that our team is very familiar with the DOE Loan Guarantee program, as we navigated this process some years ago. It is a very slow process and requires more than a year (for some projects) to complete. It also costs a great deal of money and resources in which to engage in this process ‚Äì those costs can easily grow into the 7 figures. We continue to examine the possibilities here, however.""***

**b) Has Niocorp possibly applied for a U.S. govt. Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described in the context above?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""No decision has yet been made as to whether or not to submit a formal application to this program, as our primary financing focus has been on private sector sources.""

# ****THEN ON - 12/22/2021 Jim:

**a) Has Niocorp recently applied for a U.S. govt. Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described in the context above?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""We are currently examining whether or not NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project would qualify for debt financing under the DOE/ LGP program.

# Thx, Jim""

# Please see Jim's response to questions posed for comment-3/17/2022:

**A) Could you comment on what the production of higher purity niobium & titanium could be utilized for once realized?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

""If the higher purity niobium and titanium intermediates that L3 was able to produce at bench-scale are replicated and proven at demonstration scale, this would put us in a position to more easily move to other products beyond those outlined in our 2019 Feasibility Study.¬†**Niobium oxide for use in Li-Ion batteries is one possible example, although the production of that product would require additional processing steps beyond the higher-purity niobium intermediate that we discussed in last week‚Äôs news release. The company is not yet in a position to make a determination on whether or not, and when, to possibly expand our Niobium product offering.**¬†**Higher grade TiO2 could expose us to additional markets where higher margins could be obtained. But, again, we are not in a position to speak to those possibilities in any detail yet.**""

**B) Niocorp‚Äôs preferred separation method is SX. Are these higher purity processes part of an improved SX process or ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

""No, the processes we recently discussed occur in the earlier stages of the flowsheet, prior to any SX processing. We look forward to unveiling those details once these processes are verified at the demonstration plant level and once all associated work needed to complete an updated Feasibility Study is completed.""

# 5/27/2022 -How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**\*\*\*RESPONSE**

""It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why. For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve. For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard. In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects. Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible. This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. (The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite, are among those that have been successfully processed for decades).Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets. There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called ‚Äúbasket price.‚Äù This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project‚Äôs ‚Äòbasket price‚Äô assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‚Äòbasket‚Äô (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs.

**There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project. \~Some projects are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.**

***\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion.***

A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn‚Äôt have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals.

# Having said all of that, it‚Äôs clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.""

# On 8/3/2022 :

**Jim- Could you offer comment on how this may affect the Elk Creek Mine moving forward?) 117th Cong., 1st Sess. H. R. 5376**

[H.R.5376 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376)

**\*\*\*Response:**

""The Senate Democrats‚Äô ‚ÄúInflation Reduction Act of 2022‚Äù legislation does indeed include several provisions that may be helpful to the Elk Creek Project. These include both production tax credits that would apply to all the critical minerals that we intend to produce, additional funding for the DPA Title III program aimed at supporting critical minerals production, and additional lending authority for the Title XVII program at DOE. If these provisions survive the amendment processes in the Senate and House, the Byrd Rule in the Senate, and can be passed by both Houses of Congress and is signed into law, it could have multiple positive impacts to the Project.

The bill text, as is presently available publicly, is attached. This bill will undoubtedly change when the Senate takes up the reconciliation process, as reconciliation does not limit amendments. There will be many amendments offered by both sides. Some of the bill‚Äôs provisions may not survive challenges on the Senate floor under what we call the ‚ÄúByrd Rule.‚Äù Additionally, implementing regulations must be written by agencies of jurisdiction following the bill‚Äôs enactment into law to determine many of the details of various programs and funding initiatives. As always with government programs and processes, little happens quickly.

Apart from this bill‚Äôs proposed provisions, we have been working with several federal agencies regarding potential assistance to the Elk Creek Project, but those agencies do not allow us to disclose any details of those processes. ""

All the best, Jim

# DEC. 10th 2024~ Idaho Antimony Mine Soon Goes Live Amid Rising U.S.-China Trade War

[Idaho Antimony Mine Soon Goes Live Amid Rising U.S.-China Trade War](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/12/10/idaho-antimony-mine-soon-goes-live-amid-rising-us-china-trade-war/)

[US President Joe Biden \(L\) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the ... \[+\]POOL\/AFP via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/j52fljilj76e1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe5dc048149cf7582b95a3fd79ba246fde2bc37)

China‚Äôs communist government¬†[moved last week](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/)¬†to ban exports of three key energy minerals - gallium, germanium, and antimony - to the United States as tensions between the two world powers continue to escalate during the presidential transition period. The three minerals at play in this US/China trade war have a wide range of applications, including for the military, batteries, and renewable energy.

""In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,"" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a written directive published December 3.

# An Escalating US/China Trade War

China‚Äôs latest move to limit exports of rare earth and critical energy minerals with military applications to the US market came a day after the¬†[Biden administration announced¬†](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-announces-new-export-controls-china-chip-industry-rcna182579)enhanced semiconductor export controls specific to China, the third such crackdown in the past three years. The US limits will apply to 140 Chinese companies and will limit exports of the kinds of high-bandwidth chips that are crucial for development of AI applications for military and other purposes.

Biden Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a release that the latest move is intended to prevent China from ‚Äúadvancing its domestic semiconductor manufacturing system, which it will use to support its military modernization.‚Äù

The US has become self-sufficient in producing some of the minerals in question in times past. But the¬†[decision by policymakers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/30/the-energy-transition-wont-happen-without-secure-mineral-supply-chains/?sh=4f7c67b86e1c)¬†and regulators in the US and other OECD nations to make the approval of new mines near-impossible starting in the 1970s put an end to that, enabling China to move to dominate the mining, processing, and supply chains for these key minerals over the last 40 years. As a result, these countries and others have become largely reliant on imports from China for their needs.

# An Opportunity Related To Antimony

Where antimony is concerned, this could all be about to change. As a reference for those unfamiliar with this critical mineral, I detailed the myriad military and technological applications for antimony¬†[in a story published](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/06/antimony-the-most-important-mineral-you-never-heard-of/)¬†in May 2021. That is one of a series of stories I‚Äôve written here since 2021 about the efforts by mining company Perpetua Resources to restart the mothballed Stibnite Mine in central Idaho.

Originally established as a gold mining operation in 1927, the Stibnite mine later discovered a large store of antimony, and was able to supply over 90% of the antimony - crucial to the production of tungsten steel - required by the US military during World War II. Output from the mine went into a gradual decline following the War, and it was mothballed in 1996. Recognizing a growing need for new domestic resources of antimony, Perpetua Resources acquired the mine and has been working for well over a decade now to obtain the federal state and federal permits needed to reopen its operations.

In addition to the again-rising needs of the military, antimony is also a critical ingredient in most modern technologies, including those critical to the success of electric vehicles and wind and solar power development. From a national security standpoint, it is now obviously problematic that the U.S. is now unable to supply the vast majority of its antimony needs. Perpetua Resources believes that, once reopened, the Stibnite Mine can provide up to 35% of US needs of this critical mineral.

In a timely coincidence of events, relief could be on the way. The U.S. Forest Service¬†[announced in September](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/09/08/idaho-antimony-mining-project-moves-a-step-closer-to-reality/)¬†the publication of a draft record of decision (ROD) authorizing Perpetua to start up operations at the Stibnite mine. If all goes to schedule under the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, the final decision could come before the end of December.

Anticipating that positive outcome, and in response to the rising trade war between the US and China, Perpetua Resources¬†[announced Monday](https://www.mining.com/web/perpetua-resources-and-sunshine-silver-to-explore-antimony-processing-in-idaho/)¬†it has entered into a non-binding agreement with Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining to explore the potential for the domestic processing of the antimony recovered from he Stibnite mine.

‚ÄúStibnite gold project is the only identified domestic reserve of antimony, and with final federal decisions expected in a matter of weeks, Perpetua is ready to work with US companies to help secure domestic production of antimony,‚Äù Perpetua CEO Jon Cherry said.

[stibnite crystal mineral sample, a semi precious rare earth mineralgetty](https://preview.redd.it/262tq45uj76e1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=23e13c572ae47e8ae7f67bc024e37c04584f87c7)

A wise person once observed that timing is everything in life, and the looming completion of this complex permitting process related to the Stibnite Mine seems a prime example barring further delays. It could become a fortunate example of one door flying open as another closes.

But it is key to remember that the US has to this point been sourcing the vast majority of its antimony needs from China and that it will take months if not years to bring this single mine to full production. Then there‚Äôs the fact that antimony is but one of an array of rare earth and critical energy minerals for which similar supply issues will now exist in the wake of the Chinese embargo.

# The Bottom Line: A Big Mess To Clean Up

As he ramped up his administration‚Äôs attempt to force a heavily subsidized energy transition on the American public in 2021, Joe Biden¬†[famously committed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2022/03/01/on-energy-mineral-supply-chains-biden-faces-an-existential-conflict/)¬†to mount a ‚Äúwhole of government effort‚Äù to secure new supply chains outside of Chinese domination for these mineral needs. To date, these efforts have been sporadic and largely unsuccessful. This reality, combined with this accelerating trade war between the US and China and the interminable state and federal permitting processes now threaten to fully stall an already slowing transition.

When he assumes office on January 20, President-elect Donald Trump and his appointees are going to have one big mess on their plate where these minerals are concerned unless this US/China trade war is quickly resolved.

Am I Overreacting for going no contact with my MIL?,AmIOverreacting,1hbircw,2024-12-10 21:04:54,4,0.75,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hbircw/am_i_overreacting_for_going_no_contact_with_my_mil/,Ok_Try2755,üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶family/in-laws,"To start off, I apologize in advance for the length of this post, as there is just so much to say.¬†
I 27f (Liz) and my fianc√© 25m (Jarrod) have been together for almost three years. I will say I‚Äôve never had the best relationship with his mother (Kendall), as we have very different personalities and ways of viewing life. To go back to the beginning, I met my now fiance on Bumble. We hit it off and just started talking like we already knew each other. He opened up to me about his past including his history with drug abuse starting at the age of 16. For context, this happened when his stepfather's coworker came to live with his family. Unbeknownst to them, this man was addicted to meth and was the one to introduce it to my fianc√©.
¬†
I will admit that in a way, I‚Äôve resented his parents for not vetting this man more before giving him a couch to sleep on right outside their kids bedroom. I grew up with an overprotective dad and the idea of that happening was wild to me. Fast forward to over a year later when they finally realized how far their child had fallen into this addiction, they kicked the man out but by this point he had already shown my fianc√©e where to get the drugs. Jarrod continued down this rabbit hole of darkness that would continue throughout the next 6 years with many trips to rehab centers.¬†

Whenever I first met Jarrod, he was still struggling with the overall addiction such as drinking heavily on a daily basis and two weeks into our meeting, he had a slip and relapsed on meth after having been clean for about a year. I had my reservations but decided to keep seeing him. About 5 months later, he and his family got into an extremely bad argument, so he moved in with me. He has since stayed clean off meth and has drastically reduced his drinking since I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of it and has also been making big efforts to better himself. Over the years he shared with me some of the things he has gone through as a child/teenager.¬†

Me, having some deep rooted trauma from my mother abandoning me has led me to practically hate the mothers of those I love, whenever they do something wrong. I know that is not okay and I recognize that and it is something that I have been working on and have really made some changes in that regard. Having said that, after hearing all the things from Jarrod, it just made me hate his mother. Whenever he would try and talk to her about his past, she would act like he was just making it up. He mentioned to her how one of her ex boyfriends used to hit him when she wasn‚Äôt around, and she flatout said that it was not true. She does not acknowledge that a grown man introduced him to drugs. She blames him. (He does fully take responsibility, and obviously the drug abuse once the man left the house was all on Jarrod, but his teenage self did not just introduce himself to it.) All of the things he told me just made me hate his parents more and more and I have gotten into many arguments with his mom about her taking no responsibility for her son's addiction in any way. I don‚Äôt mean that they are to blame for the entirety of his addiction; I mean that they failed to protect him and see no wrong with having let the guy move in. (I guess in my head, if this had happened to my son, my thought would be ‚Äúhow could I have missed this? This is my fault.‚Äù). All of this on its own, made me not want to have a close relationship with them personally. I did not keep Jarrod from his mother, nor did I encourage him to cut her off.¬†

Back in November of 2023, I found I was pregnant. We obviously told our family and they were all excited for us, including my mother-in-law. I had hoped that maybe this was going to be a time where we could bond and get closer; but what was already a strained relationship just got worse throughout my pregnancy. His mom and stepdad had no respect for the boundaries we had planned for once my son got here including her not seeing him the day I had my C-section and the rules for when they did get to meet him like washing hands and changing clothes as they are chain smokers. I had informed them previously about the ‚Äúrules‚Äù and why I was setting them in place. I didn‚Äôt want my baby to smell like cigarettes or be exposed to 3rd hand smoke.

My delivery did not go as planned, and I had to have a C-section. I wanted my comfort people there in the waiting room. Those people were my best friend, my dad, and my step mom. Once Kendall found out, she asked if she could just be in the waiting room with them and that she would leave with them once she heard that baby and I were good. I said yes, as that was fair. When she got to the waiting room, she brought her husband, her husband's father, and her parents as well as her daughter on the way. She told my friend that they were all just gonna see the baby and leave. My fianc√© went to the waiting room to tell her again that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable letting her meet him that day. She tried to argue back, but he stayed firm and told them they could come back the next day and she agreed. The next day, she told us what time she was coming, but showed up 3 hours later after visiting hours were over. When she came in, she came straight to my baby and I and literally took my baby from my arms. She did not wash her hands, and she did not ask. After a few minutes, he started crying. Jarrod asked for her to give the baby to him, but she said that she had it. Jarrod had to ask for him 3 times before she finally gave him back.¬†

Fast forward a little, and I guess raising our son really got to my fianc√©. He did not want our son to have a similar life that he had. He wanted our son‚Äôs relationship with Kendall to be better than what he had. He sent a text to his mom addressing his feelings about his childhood and how he wanted her to go to therapy in hopes they could learn to communicate better. He stated that until then, he would be going no contact. She said no and that she wouldn‚Äôt be wasting her money on that. He continued the no contact till hurricane Helene hit. He caved to see if his mom was okay and after that she acted like nothing happened. She started calling him a few times a week asking to see our baby and I just avoided the situation.¬†

Most recently he wanted to go to get his CDLs so that he could get a career that would support our little family. We are low income and make do with what we have, but we definitely did have the money sitting around to pay for his CDLs. He mentioned the idea to his grandparents and they agreed till his mom went and showed them the text he sent. His grandmother was livid and when we went to get the check for the classes she went in on him for half an hour about how disrespectful he was and that it was extremely immature of him. She said that he needs to leave the past in the past and forgive. She was saying his mom did her best to raise him and he should be on his hands and knees kissing her feet for all the things she did for him. She also mentioned they wouldn‚Äôt be paying for the classes they had agreed to. That was okay because in the end, it is their money, and they can do as they please. (Thankfully my best friend loaned him the money and he has been able to move forward). Kendall had told her parents that she had introduced me to my OB, as it was hers. This was not true. My best friend introduced me because it was her OB. She told them that she paid to get my expired birth control taken out. That was not true, as my insurance paid for that. She told them that she is the one who convinced me not to have an abortion, when in reality, the moment I heard his heartbeat, I was convinced. And finally, she told them that she drove me to all my appointments. This was not true. In the very beginning my best friend drove me because I had an unreliable car. The rest of the pregnancy, I drove myself because my friend bought me a car.¬†¬†

So basically, because of all of this, I have officially decided that I am done with Jarrods side of the family. I have told him that he is free to have whatever relationship with them that he wants and I will support that. I need to be the best mother I can be to our son, and he does not deserve to see me stressed out and constantly mad about people.¬†

So am I overreacting?"
Guys... we need an Alt-Coin NASDAQ,Hedera,1hb6jo2,2024-12-10 12:05:10,21,0.89,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1hb6jo2/guys_we_need_an_altcoin_nasdaq/,Chris-G-O,Discussion,"I will keep this as brief as I can make it.

**Alt-Coin market's Top-30 market cap**  
**----------------------------------------------------**

* Use & Utility: \~ $400 Bn
* Ponzis, Memes & Collectibles: \~ $2 Tn

See Appendix below.

Q: Can I expect from this ""market"" to assess - never mind: ""valuate"" - Use & Utility projects?  
A: Nope.

**HBAR ETF**  
**---------------**

Q: If not this market, then which market can valuate Use & Utility?  
A: ""Wall Street"" (used here as a generic term, covering serious investment professionals, incl. ""Institutional"" money managers, etc.)

Q: How can Wall Street access HBAR?  
A: Through an ETF, only.

Q: Is it likely that an HBAR ETF be attractive to Wall Street?  
A: Just take a look at **Hedera's GC:** ***they're all on Wall Street to begin with.***

**HBAR & HBAR ETF = Bitcoin**  
**-----------------------------------------**

One would naively think that the ultimate beneficiary from the potential success of the HBAR ETF would be the HBAR. Think again. Within the current market structure, the ultimate beneficiary of the HBAR's price appreciation is **Bitcoin.**

This is how:

* I spend USD to buy (HBAR/USD).
* After that, while I am in the market, the HBAR/BTC trade pair creates a dynamic in which the HBAR's price increase directly impacts its valuation in BTC terms ***because the increased demand for BTC to trade with HBAR bolsters BTC‚Äôs market activity and liquidity.***

E.g. HBAR/BTC.  
Buying HBAR = selling Bitcoin - thus ensuring Bitcoin's liquidity.  
Selling HBAR = buying Bitcoin - thus increasing Bitcoin's price.

This mechanism allows Bitcoin to leech off price and liquidity from every asset on the board that is traded as Coin/BTC.

In turn Bitcoin maintains its position because ***exchanges are free to list Coin/BTC trade pairs as they please.***

Thus, the entire Alt-Coin market is, in reality, a Bitcoin derivative market which, in turn, is controlled by \~ 100 addresses (according [Bitcoin's concentration stats](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)).

**Alt-Coin NASDAQ**  
**--------------------------**

We clearly need another market for Use & Utility Alt-Coins, structured along the lines of the NYSE / NASDAQ paradigm.

In the Alt-Coin world this could potentially mean:

* Alt-Coin Casino market where Ponzis and Memes rule the day.
* Alt-Coin NASDAQ equivalent, where ***investment*** as we know it is offered space to grow and claim its rightful market value - whatever that may be.

Perhaps the (still pending in the US) commodity / security classification could play a role in something like this. I am somewhat certain that with a reasonable deadline and SEC cooperation every serious Use & Utility project out there could classify as ""alt-security"".

**$fiat as Quote Currency**  
\---------------------------------

Needless to mention that the only way to decouple the Atl-Coin NASDAQ from the Alt-Coin Casino is to peg the former on $fiat-as-quote-currency, e.g. HBAR/USD, HBAR/EUR, HBAR/CAD, etc - like the stock market does. 

After all, if its outright criminal for the stock market to list stock/stock trade pairs why should it be legal for the alt-coin market to list crypto/crypto trade pairs?    

**Current Outlook**  
**-----------------------**

Currently (Dec 10, 2024) the new US SEC chair made some statements recently but we haven't had a policy announcement yet.

Vet Recommendations,glasgow,1ha8y3s,2024-12-09 07:47:32,1,0.6,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1ha8y3s/vet_recommendations/,Ok_Tangelo1175,,"I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for a vet around Glasgow. Preferably Southside or around paisley however will travel for the right vet. 

I have a dog that has an extensive medical history and I‚Äôm looking to switch to a new vet. I‚Äôm looking for one that does direct claims with the insurer (preferably at no extra cost) and can offer evening appointments. Also a practice that has out of hours services is a must in case of emergencies. 

I‚Äôd prefer it wasn‚Äôt a chain as my current vet practice was sold, most of the original vets left and it‚Äôs not the same anymore as you rarely see the same vet twice. I‚Äôd prefer a practice where you see the same vet most of the time. 

I‚Äôve tried registering at Rouken Glen as heard great things however they‚Äôre not accepting new patients and there‚Äôs no timeline as to when they‚Äôll reopen for new patients. 

If anyone has their pet at a great vet or has used a vet in the past that they‚Äôd highly recommend, I‚Äôd be grateful if you could share their details. "

I‚Äôve got several different lots of LEGO minifigures and sets to sell.  I‚Äôm marking these down anywhere from 30-50% off from the Bricklink 6-month average price.  The prices you see listed in the following charts are the comparable Bricklink 6-month average price that I used to determine the price for the separate lots.  Prices DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING.  Some of the boxes are big and heavy.  I can provide a shipping quote for anything listed here.

I‚Äôm not splitting any lots at this time.  The prices listed are for reference and not an indication of individual prices per set/minifigure.

Price: $800.00 (40% off of BL 6-month average of $1,327.05)

Minifigures are individually bagged and labeled with the minifigure number.  Almost all are used, so may have play wear, scuffs, or cracks.  However, I did my best to identify major issues with figures as I sorted, so check my chart for notes about the individual figures.  I‚Äôm happy to answer questions about any of them, or provide additional pictures, if needed.

#LEGO Superheroes Used Sets

Price: $650.00 (40% off BL 6-month average of $1,088.50)

These sets have not been inventoried.  Most of the sets were built and displayed.  The sets were disassembled and bagged.  Wherever possible, all minifigures, manual, and build parts were identified and included.  However, it is possible that some parts, minor secondary build pieces, and minifigures are missing.  Most of the sets should include the parts needed to build the main build.  I would anticipate that weapons/accessories would be the most common missing pieces.  I‚Äôve discounted the price by more than 40% to account for the fact that these sets are not inventoried.  I‚Äôm happy to answer additional questions, provide pictures, or attempt to confirm how complete a set may be, if you have additional questions.

Like the used Superheroes sets, most of these sets have not been inventoried.  Sets were built and displayed.  When disassembled, we did our best to match minifigures and secondary build pieces.  However, the sets were not inventoried and may be missing pieces.  I would assume minifigure accessories and secondary build pieces would be the most likely missing pieces.  A large bag of mini dolls and second large bag of Friends related parts are included.  I would guess that most of the missing pieces from the sets are included in the bag of spare parts.  I‚Äôm happy to answer questions and provide additional pictures, if needed.

This is a bulk lot of approximately 40lbs of Bionicle and Hero Factory parts.  I started to sort the parts, so in the picture you can see a large bag of masks and accessories, a second large bag of Technics related parts, and a bag of miscellaneous instruction manuals.  This is a bulk lot accumulated through many bulk buys over the years.  I have no idea if any of the sets with instruction manuals are complete.  Assume not.  The light pearl gray Hua Nuva mask is not included in the bulk lot.

I bought some VET in early 2021. I transferred it to a hot wallet app on my phone. At the time, I believe it was the main or only app wallet made for VET. It was called something with the word ""Thor"" in it. I thought it was Thor Wallet. I downloaded that app from the app store, it said my seed phrase was valid and let me import it, but it's showing my balance as zero... I can't even find a mention of Vechain anywhere on the app.

Any ideas?"

Vechain üöÄüöÄüöÄ,CryptoMarkets,1h75yr5,2024-12-05 05:12:05,3,0.56,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1h75yr5/vechain/,Original-Surprise167,,"Why Buy VeChain (VET) Now at $0.07?

VeChain (VET) is not just another cryptocurrency; it‚Äôs a blockchain ecosystem with real-world use cases that position it uniquely for exponential growth. At its current price of $0.07, VeChain represents a rare opportunity to invest in a proven project at an undervalued stage. Here‚Äôs why VeChain could be one of the best investments in blockchain technology today, with the potential to reach $1:

1. Real-World Use Cases and Enterprise Adoption

VeChain has cemented itself as a leader in supply chain management and enterprise solutions, with partnerships spanning across global giants like PwC, BMW, Walmart China, and DNV GL. These partnerships validate VeChain‚Äôs value in ensuring transparency, efficiency, and traceability. With the global supply chain industry estimated to be worth $15 trillion by 2030, VeChain is poised to become a critical infrastructure provider.

2. Undervalued Market Cap

VeChain‚Äôs market cap of just $5 billion is a fraction of its true potential when compared to projects with similar real-world adoption. By solving billion-dollar inefficiencies in logistics, sustainability, and carbon tracking, VeChain is uniquely positioned to expand its market share. A price of $1 would only put VeChain‚Äôs market cap around $64 billion‚Äîa realistic target given its growth trajectory and enterprise partnerships.

3. Expanding Ecosystem

VeChain has moved beyond supply chain solutions, launching initiatives in DeFi, NFTs, and carbon credit tracking. This ecosystem expansion creates additional demand for VET tokens, driving up both utility and value. The launch of tools like VeCarbon for sustainability tracking aligns VeChain with ESG goals, a trillion-dollar investment trend that will attract institutional interest.

4. Favorable Macro Environment

As the global economy embraces blockchain for efficiency, VeChain stands out as one of the few projects with real-world adoption. Additionally, VeChain benefits from its low-cost, energy-efficient blockchain, positioning it as a sustainable choice for enterprises. With increased regulation favoring credible projects, VeChain‚Äôs enterprise-grade blockchain puts it ahead of competitors.

5. Path to $1

For VeChain to reach $1, it would need to 14x from its current price of $0.07. Consider these driving factors:
	‚Ä¢	Mass Adoption: Existing partnerships are just the beginning; as blockchain adoption accelerates, VeChain‚Äôs scalable solutions can onboard new industries.
	‚Ä¢	Supply Chain Revolution: With global businesses prioritizing transparency and traceability post-COVID, VeChain has a clear runway to dominate.
	‚Ä¢	Retail and Institutional Interest: The current price point makes VET attractive for both retail investors seeking high returns and institutions looking for blockchain exposure.

The Time to Act is Now

At $0.07, VeChain offers an entry point that many investors might look back on as a missed opportunity. The combination of real-world utility, growing adoption, and a global focus on sustainability makes VeChain a project with $1 in its sights. As the crypto market recovers and blockchain adoption accelerates, VeChain has the fundamentals to reward early investors handsomely.

Don‚Äôt wait for the headlines to tell you what you already know‚ÄîVeChain is the future, and the future is now"
