2014 1.8L TSI Turbo 97k Miles  it cranks but no Start.,Volkswagen,1hlfmkz,2024-12-24 10:19:22,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volkswagen/comments/1hlfmkz/2014_18l_tsi_turbo_97k_miles_it_cranks_but_no/,Marcop300,,"we have owned this car for 5 years and have no issues, it oes burn some oil (no leaks, or white smoke). so we do check oil ALL the time and we and oil when needed. we also change oil every 5-6k miles. Last 2 years, have changed out fuel filter.  
  
how it started. daughter was driving home about 2 miles from the house, the car stalled at a stop sign. she started it back up and drove home. the car then was parked in the driveway. when the tried to start it up maybe 40 mins after the car was off. It now does a crank no start.  
  
what have i tested using ROSS-Tech VCDS ver 24.7..1  
  
1st errors was below... this steps i have done...  
  
  
(not in this order.... but i have done lots of steps)  
  
1. I cleared all errors (now only have abs and tiptronic codes)  
2. replaced cam and crank sensors  
3. compression each cly 180+ lbs  
4. remove gas hose from gas tank near the tubo... fuel does come out of hose  
5. Measure bar after high fuel pump is 226 bar (also see output below)..  
6. vag tool shows rpm aout 280-300RPM while trying to start  
7. 12.3-12.7 volt on battery (i even have tried to jump with my GMC 2500 HD)  
8. after checking all compression, i even pt 4 new plugs in the car  
9. even took off and cleaned out the Variable Valve Timing Position Sensor Magnet module and made sure the little prong is working (and moving)  
10 fuel is in the car IDE00588 Fuel tank fill level 32.5 %  
11. RPM gauge in the cluster moves JUST A LITTLE when trying to start.  
12 i have checked all fuses and nothing is blown also have not bought any relays (but have swapped the 2 green 644 relays under hood and inside car (drv side fuse box)  
13. i power to each coil back when car is on  
14. i have taken off ONLY one coil pack #4 and added old plug to it and it does spark when i try to turn over (maybe a slow spark... but i don't have a baseline on what is good or bad)  
15. i have looked at each piston when a camera and there are no holes in the piston  
16. i have NO changed the old to see if any metal is in the pan (but don't think i need to do that.. compression is good)  
17. i have reset ECM but touching + and - cables (WHILE THEY ARE NOT ON THE BATTERY) for 5 mins  
18. using VCDS i have reset and learn/adaptation the MAF  
  
  
  
my next step it to order a fuel HIGH Pressure Fuel pump coming in a few days ( just seeing IF that can be the issue)  
  
if that is not it, i need take cover off timing chain and see if TDC is set on allÂ cams.etc( i just HOPE it's not the chain/tensioner) . (but DO NOT want do that work) Does anyone know of a Ross tech/VCDS option i can look at to see if i am GETTING good timing or what are good/bad numbers to look for?

I do sincerely apologize for how late this is. Life events plus the âweight-gateâ has left it harder for me to test weapons. Here are our Festival of the Lost weapon breakdowns! The main Revenant breakdown should be coming soon!

Braytech Werewolf is the sole survivor of the two FotL auto rifle conundrum we've had. Poor Horror Story (though whether it's a glitch or not, you can enhance your old FotL weaponsâ¦SGA). When using Braytech Werewolf in PvE your best roll is Rewind Rounds or Subsistence paired with your choice of Onslaught or Kinetic Tremors. It entirely depends on how you would like to use this auto. All 4 perks are great on their own and make this auto feel incredible.

Precision Frame auto rifles got a recent buff but still don't feel as dominant as they did in year 1 of Destiny 2. Wild that we've come this far. Lone Wolf will give you the best feel for being solo but if you prefer to team-shoot or just live in 6s your better perks are Dynamic Sway Reduction or Zen Moment. Kill Clip is tried and true for the fourth column. Tap the Trigger does stack with our accuracy boosts in the third column for an extremely sticky auto rifle. Desperate Measures is my favorite neutral damage perk that can work with any ability build.

Arcane Embrace is the newest frame to Destiny 2. A double fire slug shotgun. Each trigger pull fires two semi-deadly slugs. (Only semi if you can hit your shots). Over in your regular PvE activities it shouldn't matter unless you regularly GM or something. Fourth Times the Charm will give you one extra trigger pull for two consecutive burst crits. Precision Instrument stacks quickly on double fire frames and will work nicely against chunky health bars and champions. Surrounded can work better depending on the encounter and how confident you are at staying alive. Bonus points for Desperado for shotgun go brrrrr.

Arcane Embrace is not good in PvP. You need to land both shots to kill and one *has* to be a crit in order for you to secure the kill. Tap the Trigger and Closing Time both help your accuracy and Lone Wolf will boost your mid tier aim assist. If you treat this like a normal shotgun or slug you're going to have a bad time.

Jurassic Green has always been an interesting weapon. It has worse base stats compared to other Rapid-Fire frame pulse rifles. Even with the deterministic recoil I preferred the base recoil with counterbalance or full send to 100 recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. Heal Clip and Incandescent are tried and true rolls but you could opt for Frenzy for the big boost to reload and handling. Loose Change with Incandescent can also make you forget about the reload stat, but falls off a bit in higher level content.

Over in the crucible you've got a few things to keep in mind. AST base Jurassic Green hits out to 30.64m. at max you're only gaining ~5m. The better play is to invest your stats into consistency perks. Closing Time and Lone Wolf are both new and exciting perks but Keep Away is tried and true. Kill Clip will make follow up kills easier and depending on your build you could go for Adrenaline Junkie or even Desperate Measures. Headseeker is the best neutral option in the fourth column.

Mechabre has always been a great sniper rifle. Even though High-Impact snipers aren't high meta their high single shot damage is great for solo play or short damage phases where accuracy isn't as important. Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge will get you better ammo with Appended Mag and a backup mag mod. If you're going to be with fireteam members, Firing Line is best in slot. Vorpal Weapon is second best but better for solo or dual fireteams.

Over in PvP you've got two different Ros to go for with combinations between them. The tried and true Snapshot Sights / Opening Shot will always work, especially good if you didn't get the free roll from Festival of the Lost past. Lone Wolf and Closing Time is the new hotness and works best with a mag boosting perk or backup mag to get 2 attempts with Closing Time (versus one shot with the base magazine of 3).

Acosmic is back and better than ever. Clown Cartridge and any of your favorite damage perks is going to be the roll to get. Impulse Amplifier is also good if you don't remember to reload before damage phases. Air Trigger can get you back to back mags with ease. I would say that Withering Gaze is not the perk to get. It's solid on special weapons and even though it's new it doesn't work well with the best in slot perk, Bait and Switch. If you can lead with Withering Gaze on another weapon you can swap to Acosmic for huge damage numbers.

Over in PvP grenade launchers lost a lot of their shine with the health changes. 70 Blast Radius is the target to hit. Impulse Amplifier to boost up grenade Velocity. Withering Gaze with Proximity Grenades or High-Explosive Ordinance wouldn't be the worst combo as you won't be able to OHK and be able to swap to your primary or special for easy clean ups. Explosive Light is easy to get with orb generation through Reaper or Siphon mods. If you opt for general use you can go with Chain Reaction.

	\- 1,75 Coal Variable Civillian Consumption

\- Camelry Support Equipment

  \- Camelry was cheaper than cavalry due to not using support equipment

  \- Now camelry uses the same amount of support equipment as cavalry



\- Generic Garrison Template Update

  \- Many countries had highly inefficient garrison templates

  \- Was throwing off equipment and manpower calculations, since garrisons would start with massive amounts of manpower and equipment that could then be easily reclaimed by just changing the template

  \- Instead all significant countries now start with a generic cavalry garrison template

  \- Some room for improvement for specific nations, but will be decent for all countries



\- Increased Air Superiority Required For Paradrop

  \- Nature of the way airforces work in game makes it too easy to build air superiority in one zone specifically to manage a paradrop, even with what should be an air disadvantage

I just thought of posting as a Real post a message I made month ago than i think have Pretty nice info. It gathers all thing i came across and discovered that could maybe be usefull for sanhua player.  \\(\^\_\^)/ Enjoy !

\_

**Oh before going**, Remember that i call ""**Burst**"" what people know as **PHA** (perfect heavy attack), i don't mean Ultimate by ""Burst"" here, Therefore I also call what people could know as ""**Weak heavy**"" simply **Heavy attack** here.  Hope you'll be able to get used to it...

\_

\_

# Tips to maximize your Damage :

(I'll Update It Everytime i'll find Something else or someone tell me something new)

(Tips from close beta)

1 .       **With Sanhua the priority order of thing to use is :**

**First : Echo, except if it's heron.**

**Second : If you wanna enable Sanhua Buffs from Basic 5, Do a heavy attack combo (combo explained laater).**

**Third : You Use Everything remaining that can be put on cooldown. (don't forget to detonate ice blocks)**

**And Fourth : after all that and if you wanna stay on Sanhua, You'll then Spam Burst .**

\_

2.      **Burst Time stop Lenght is Always approximatively 0.7s, Note than it doesn't stop Challenge timer. Basically : NOTHING ,except mob touched by burst, is freeze by it. and the freeze start on the touch of Sanhua Dash from Burst.**

**\_**

3.      **Most of the time**, **I** **Do not recommend to wait the Sheathe with Burst while the boss is not staggered, in down state. (Burst have 2 Part if you didn't know, damage on dash, and damage on sheathe, those 2 part deal the same amount of damage)**

**But if the boss is staggered,in down state, Wait to Sheathe with Burst for Maximum DPS !**

**(if you're really experimented you can sometimes wait for the sheathe damage even when the boss is not staggered if you think for whatever reason than it might have more value than longer opening window. Cause it do is better sometimes yes)**

**\_**

4.       **After Skill, Briefly Press Jump, then immediatly start Holding your Burst as always, to Sneak a Basic attack before detonation ! (Outdated, Jump cancel Dead)**

**\_**

5.       **If you have a Ice block already on field, Thanks to Ultimate or intro skill, Release a Burst toward this Ice block and then cancel it with Skill to make Skill Ice block detonate by itself !**

**\_**

6.      **It is not needed to touch with your Burst every single Ice block for them to detonate. As long as you hit 1 Ice block hitbox with your Burst, Other Iceblocks will detonate no matter what. You also don't need to do the whole Burst animation for them to detonate.**

\_

7.     **You can Abuse of Swap back, swap cancel, anything swap, during Sanhua Burst. Don't hesitate to test every interaction your team can do with that !**

**\_**

# Big update to this Tips comment for the Game Release !

\_

1 *-  Jump cancel was r****emoved,*** *Meaning sadly ""tips* ***4*** *of pre-release tips"" d****on't*** *w****ork*** *anymore :(*

*\_*

*2 - But a new tech to balance it out ! :*  
*If you r****elease*** *y****our*** *B****urst*** *Right b****efore*** *l****anding*** *f****rom*** *a j****ump***, and then a***fter*** *l***anding** *; you s****tart*** *c****harging*** *a****nother*** *B****urst***. This will make your S***anhua*** *d***o** a b***asic*** *a***ttack** *b****efore*** *q****uickly*** *R****eleasing*** *h****er*** *p****reviously*** *m****ade*** *B****urst*** *on landing. Also work for Heavy attack*

*Can be Usefull if you Predicted an opening from the enemy !*

*\_*

*3 - The f****astest*** *w****ay*** *t****o*** *d****etonate*** *i****ce*** *b****lock*** *a****fter*** *a* ***skill*** *is (beside ""Close beta* ***tips number 5"")*** *: to p****reemptively*** *A****ctivate*** *m****oving*** *y****our*** *F****orte*** *c****ircuit*** *m****etronome***, then use S**kill**, t***hen*** *D***odge** *a****s*** *f****ast*** *a****s*** *p****ossible*** *a****fter*** *t****he*** *i****ce*** *b****lock*** *a****ppeared***, and release your Burst. Work the same for U**ltimate**, without the dodge needed.

*\_*

*4 - I'm viewing everything  with a huge B****oss*** *c****entered*** *v****iewpoint***, But Tower of adversity is also a really important mode. And in this one ; a lot of time you'll fight multiple enemy, in those cases S***pamming*** *B***urst can** *b****e*** *a b****it*** *t****ricky*** *a****nd*** *l****ess*** *e****ffective*** *t****han*** *u****sual***. Therefore Don't be scared to use  H***eavy*** *A***ttack** *C****ombo*** *that can really fit better against multiple spread enemy ( The combo being : Heavy attack - > B4 ->B5 -> loop back/Burst -> If Burst previously, then Repeat loop now)*

*\_*

*5 - If you have  S****5*** *S****anhua*** *. W****ait*** *an Ice block to A****uto-detonate*** *, and only shortly a****fter*** *t****hat*** *; r****elease*** *a b****urst***. This way you d***etonate*** *t***he** *i****ce*** *t****wice***. for twice more damage ! (obviously require the enemy to not move out)

# The ""Maximum-Cooking"" Tips ! :

***For People that wanna style with Sanhua !***

\_

\_

# 1 - Never outing Sanhua.

As  ""G**ame** r**elease** T**ips 3""** Imply, It is possible to keep Forte circuit metronome **On** during **Skill and Ultimate**.  
But it is also possible to  keep Forte circuit metronome activated during **Swap Cancel**                                                       Enabling **Permanent swap cancel during Burst spam** on sanhua **while maintaining a good Burst frequency**

**However they is 2 Rule for it to work :**

Rule 1 -  You cannot unhand left click. **You need to keep Left click hold** (or whatever your attack button is) **Even when swaped on your other character**. And that ; until you release your Sanhua Burst. (or heavy attack if you fail :p) Note than releasing left click **without having swaped back** on sanhua will **not cast anything with Sanhua.**

Rule 2 - **The moment Sanhua Visually vanish from the stage, the forte circuit metronome position will not be saved. no matter what.** It will come back to Default position when Sanhua disappear. Therefore this technique is usefull **only on Swap backable attack.** Luckily Sanhua have a lot of Swap backable Attack. Most common options are : **Burst, Skill, Basic 3,4,5, and Heavy attack**

\_

\_

# 2 - Burst Storing

I'll be straightforward, **Sanhua can ""Save"" 1 Burst for later when switched out.**

For That, **you'll need to try to Release a Burst during a moment Sanhua Cannot cast one.** Best moments for that in my opinion are : **Plunge/simply being in air, Start animation of Skill, Start animation of Basic 5, and Dodge**. Simply being in air and Skill is the easiest, Basic 5 and dodge is harder.                                                                                                                                                           Instantly **after The Forte circuit metronome come back to Default position after you have done what i have said, Swap out of her.**

**If done Correctly**  you should successfully have **""Saved""** 1 Burst for later.

From now on, **You can play on your 2 others character and all should be good**.                                                                    However, **If you wanna comeback on Sanhua** you'll have to **be on ground, and be holding left click** (or whatever your attack button is) **on your present character on-field Before swaping on Sanhua**. (little advice, do it noticeably before swaping on sanhua, not shortly before swaping on sanhua.)

If Everything went well, **Sanhua will Achieve a Burst The moment you'll release your finger from left click. Without the Forte circuit metronome even moving.**

This tech is probably **the fastest way to detonate Ult iceblock directly after being swaped in.**

\_

*Now i would have to say than this tech is unstable and will sometimes not work even when i believe everything is done well. i'm Still investigating what can turn off the ""Saved"" Burst. (now it's not super unstable don't misunderstand me, it's consistency is just.. weird. cannot describe it other way)*

\_

\_

\_

\_

\_

Aaaand done. If you're certain than something i said is wrong then feel free to tell me. I did not only did this list for other but Also mainly because i wanted to have something reminding me what i knew aha.  
This list might get bigger as time goes. And i'm purposefully not putting echo related tips.

Thanks  for reading me till the end !"

Now, to state the purpose of this post.. it's about a Company Takeover and Market Transformation.

# The Takeover aka Leveraged Buyout

The takeover has already happened behind closed doors, and now, we are just waiting for the confirmation (recall all the [stalking horse clues](https://www.reddit.com/r/edwinbarnesc/comments/146ae05/gmerica_activist_affiliates_are_the_stalking/) and tweets).

Other clues have always been present throughout GMERICA NFTs, and from Pulte tweets.

&#x200B;

[Pulte tweets about mysterious funds that appear...](https://preview.redd.it/guca4nqbtg0c1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fee69394e5f60244dc5e72b16b9cb5327c4f083)

If you've been following the court dockets, then you may have been surprised by the mysterious claim for $10.8B last month and an initial deposit of $1B by someone named Brandon Meadows. That's $11.8B, close enough to the fund raised by $IEP Brett Icahn.

If you look into the background of Brandon Meadows, it leads to [Addison Holdings, which is connected to Five Guys through Dream on Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17nyxlz/brandon_meadows_a_connection_to_dream_on_me/) and where Pulte made a bet and had PPSeeds buy him a [Five Guys burger.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17cfxok/its_burger_time/)

Brandon Meadows represents a group of buyers or Activists via Brett Icahn:

1. See [Icahn Partners Master Fund LP](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fuwh66mjsvw2b1.png%3Fwidth%3D1160%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D1d50a38dfb5c7d0a3ff2f7e8af6a6aacd212be5d) that reveals a massive pooled investment with Affiliates
2. Next, are the [Affiliates connecting Brett's Portfolio Managers](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fk31c27psww2b1.png%3Fwidth%3D2636%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D328dc9900b9bd8b7daa1fc4cf373f111a2732300) and Pulte Family Office.
3. Finally, $IEP which links to $BBBY via DIP Facility and Proskauer Rose - **11 TIMES SQUARE**

The Alamo is symbolic from history, in that Texas made a **bid** for independence.

Besides, GameStop is in Texas where the chairman has been working:

&#x200B;

[Ryan Cohen of Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/klqaseeftg0c1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1304c33898257f3247400dd22dadbca26c1c2b)

Ryan Cohen has had his eyes on $BBBY from the beginning, or at least since December 21, 2020 where Proskauer Rose at ELEVEN TIMES SQUARE was informed.

Why is this important? Because Proskauer Rose directly works for Carl Icahn.

RC has been aware of the swap baskets since these are all the clues that DFV pointed to in his videos hence the $GME x $BBBY play.

&#x200B;

[Proskauer Rose connects $GME, $IEP, $BBBYQ](https://preview.redd.it/jfgxd6sgtg0c1.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=a277f41687b0a6ec7eb5039621017dd7b678cb1d)

It's all connected.

Now for the transformation process..

# Delisting under Chapter11

Anyone still in this play has accepted that ch11 bankruptcy and restructuring was necessary to achieve the following:

1. Trap the shorts & expose abusive naked shorting to DOJ
2. Unlock NOL (net operating loss) Tax write-offs for $BBBYQ acquirer
3. Activate the Reverse Uno trap card (anti-cellar boxing)

In the [latest development](https://twitter.com/citizennft_eth/status/1722629766778687879) ([@citizennft\_eth](https://twitter.com/citizennft_eth) on X), an expert fraud lawyer named [Michael Goldberg](https://www.akerman.com/en/people/michael-goldberg.html) has been hired as $BBBY ch11 plan administrator.

What's interesting about this lawyer and his law firm Akerman is their direct involvement in helping investors recover losses from ponzi schemes and naked shorting from the likes of Bernie Madoff and Lou Pearlman (who managed backstreet boys and n'sync).

Michael Goldberg - this man fucks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2cevh6uhtg0c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7885d067f9ba5f1a08ba5babab95f0fb34ad277a

Michael Goldberg, signs off as $BBBY plan admin to hold harmless DTCC **unless fraud is involved**.

Needless to say, fraud is evident from cellar boxing due to abusive ""naked shorts, yeah"" -CNBC.

This is a textbook fraud case which the shorts have eagerly walked into and there is no escape.

$GME apes know GameStop has been working with SEC since 2021 and previous filings showed they have completed the work. However, SEC alone cannot do enforcement because that's the job of DOJ.

&#x200B;

[DOJ ready to drop the hammer on shorts, soon](https://preview.redd.it/7hqdwu8jtg0c1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c52ad866777e7cebc262bba1ecf8bccca1a509a)

There is also a strong belief that DOJ is directly involved since they handle enforcement on behalf of SEC and previously made public statements that they will be pursuing enforcement against corporate crime.

&#x200B;

[DOJ looking into corporate crime](https://preview.redd.it/0xf7rb2mtg0c1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=2462d76e87a93f534f3c571d4f0828b5c35a9045)

The DOJ is actively looking at compensation incentives and compliance, or basically Boston Consulting Group hedgie-plants like ex-CEO $BBBY Mark Tritton that are paid to sabotage companies via cellar boxing (loading up debt and draining a company's cash reserve via stock buybacks).

The takeaway here is that the enforcement agencies have been moving behind the scenes, like the recent announcement of Virtu Finance, market-maker that is under investigation by SEC.

RICO took down the mafia, madoff ponzi, and will result in the same for the bad actors committing securities fraud.

&#x200B;

[Virtu investigated by SEC - Doug Cifu, CEO at Virtu has been spewing vitriol on X at $BBBYQ apes](https://preview.redd.it/o9p1fs0ptg0c1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=b238ce102a99d1a77dc845f3d54e525183e750b6)

Furthermore, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has recently begun a PR campaign attempting to paint SEC in a neutral role in regulating markets. This is highly sus, almost as if attempting to cast misdirects for their failure to safeguard investors and markets leading to rampant corruption and abuse by market makers and SHFs.

&#x200B;

[Goldman Sach's ex-employee Gary Gensler claims SEC is trying to make markets fair, what a joke](https://preview.redd.it/57u7qluqtg0c1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a8329c558493316bec1418654d22df142a035a5)

They know something is about to happen that is beyond their control so the narrative is changing, as was foretold in the DD.

So wtf does this all mean?

# Transformation: Prepare for Relisting

Fraud. Naked shorts. Market manipulation. This is all at the center of this play.

Before MOASS can be initiated, everything must be documented for SEC and DOJ because apes will not be held responsible and the public needs someone to blame.

Transformation is about to take place and it starts with relisting on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

This clue came about in several parts:

**1. Pulte tweeted ""Icahn"" for the first time.**

This means the end is really, really close and it further supports my thesis on Brett Icahn and the Affiliates takeover.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pudf58ttg0c1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b70a6ad62ec8094d46b5d89a809a94c64629c0ec

**2. $BYON, the new ticker of $OSTK is now listed under NYSE**

Marcus Lemonis, board member and new CEO at $BYON comments *NYSE is the beginning of free markets.* He's also wearing a turtleneck.

&#x200B;

[Marcus Lemonis tweets: welcome to the free market \($BYON on NYSE\)](https://preview.redd.it/6oiu6jjutg0c1.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af42e27217334a68e190d85f8c76eb552252087b)

**3. About 2 years ago, the President of NYSE was the first insider to call out market manipulation.**

This surprised everyone at that time because it was first instance where an insider publicly acknowledged what apes had been speculating 6 months prior in the Jan 2021 sneeze. It also stood out to me and was always in the back of my mind, but now it makes perfect sense. NYSE is ape-friendly and the spokesperson at-the-time was Stacey Cunningham, working for Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), a subsidiary of NYSE that is present-day working on blockchain for the markets and tZERO.

In those days, apes were barely scraping the surface of market mechanics. Dave Lauer was elevated on a pedestal on SS while actively denying: market manipulation, dark pools, and a host of other obvious wrongdoings so when this article was released it directly challenged what he was saying.

Shortly after, apes started waking up to the fact that perhaps Dave's interest were not aligned with retail (he never supported DRS until it was favorable for him) and to this day, I still believe he is a Citadel plant just like that FINRA plant Platnum Sparkles. Together, they subvert apes with influence each running their own psyops and grifting: one sells access to SHF-bias market knowledge and the other sells shitty NFTs.

&#x200B;

[NYSE President dropping a bombshell on market manipulation, directly challenging Dave Lauer at the time](https://preview.redd.it/llp4k4jytg0c1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0248c06794cddd69350b4f01495abb9c4572659)

**4. tZERO blockchain is** [**affiliated with ICE, a subsidiary of NYSE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17h81lm/tzero_overstock_and_the_people_surrounding/)

It remains to be seen if tZERO is truly ape-friendly, but it looks like lines are being drawn in the sand. Shorts are running for cover (jk) and once-friendly SHF associates are now joining the Affiliates because the writing is on the wall.

Adopt or die.

&#x200B;

[tZERO & NYSE](https://preview.redd.it/bv850na0ug0c1.jpg?width=2710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d8128583d871cc7f83f5ad6f83e81c797988227)

**5. Icahn was an employee at Dreyfus which is now owned by Bank of New York (BNY Mellon)**

In an article from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carl-icahn-reflects-early-experience-213357723.html), Carl Icahn once worked for legendary investor Jack Dreyfus during the bull market of 1960s until it crashed in 62.

>*""I had to go through the pain \[to learn\]. The market is not a gambling casino, and too many people think that it is, especially with low interest rates. So it's really a dangerous place.""*

Interest rates huh?

Ryan Cohen once tweeted:

>Low interest rates may prove to be like easy sex â tempting but possibly fatal

DFV also tweeted memes about Dreyfus via Julia Louis Dreyfus from Seinfeld.

**6. BNY owns AST but was acquired by Equiniti, a blockchain-capable platform**

Equiniti or formerly-AST was also the transfer agent for $BBBY before ch11. [Equiniti was purchased by BNY Mellon](https://www.reddit.com/r/edwinbarnesc/comments/14875c4/ast_computershare_now_bank_through_bny_mellon_the/) and has recently finalized transactions.

**7. BNY also owns Computershare ($GME transfer agent)**

BNY Mellon holds significant power by monopolizing 2 of the largest transfer agents, was responsible for creating [$GME Brazilian puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/edwinbarnesc/comments/14875c4/comment/jnyse3h/), and was the custodian of the debt notes used by Jake Freeman.

So where does BNY Mellon stand?

Perhaps they tried cornering RC & Affiliates but the activists found a way out with NYSE and tZERO.

This shouldn't be a surprise, after all, $BBBY cut a deal with the devil, Hudson Bay Capital, and nobody knows what their real role is yet.

# 7 clues for 1 outcome: Blockchain Markets

The infrastructure has been setup.

We are about to witness the birth of a new company that has been preparing for a market transformation into blockchain.

And it won't be just $BBBYQ that's listed but every other highly shorted stock or those also emerging out of bankruptcy: Sears, Toys R Us, Party City, the list goes on -- some pending corporate action.

November 16, 2020 -- 2 days from now will mark the 3rd anniversary when Ryan Cohen wrote his [letter to GameStop](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F9c680f10ww2b1.png%3Fwidth%3D828%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D9f4cf80ccd657a6a0590cbaf5a846c74af0a41f0) board and put his plans into motion.

# TLDR;

* Proskauer Rose links $GME, $IEP, $BBBYQ
* Brett Icahn will eventually make an appearance - $IEP succession plan ([investor day coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePPShow/comments/17umti7/wut_doing_carl_wut_meeting_with_investors_and/))
* SEC is pretending they tried to make fair markets, Gary Gensler on PR campaign
* DOJ is involved and has been investigating - the hammer is about to drop on shorties
* Lines have been drawn in the sand, alliances have been forming (e.g. SHF = Hudson Bay Capital)
* NYSE is ape-friendly since June 2021
* tZERO is working with ICE, a subsidiary of NYSE
* Blockchain is about to squeeze the fuck out of shorts

Part 2, soon

# GMERICA  ð´ââ ï¸

.

Edit: some confusion on what I think about HBC, they are a SHF but not in the way we think. HBC cut a deal and are a friendly to $BBBY management. If you read my other DDs, you would see that. I was one of the first to claim they were a good-guy when everyone else screamed bad actors.

I previously discovered that the office of Hudson Bay Capital is in the same building with Carl Icahn's new york office. And its a building that Icahn owns the lease to:

[https://i.redd.it/1i1dp7hyjbha1.png](https://i.redd.it/1i1dp7hyjbha1.png)

Another thing I would like to clear up about BNY Mellon, Computershare, and the word ownership, for context:

There is a discrepancy in the meaning behind the word ownership here.

Although I believe this is my fault.

I am referring to controlling interests and stake within a company.

Think of it this way: Ken Griffin of Citadel does not own Bloomberg but every time someone on the air speaks out of turn and brings up his name on TV then they have to apologize immediately. He doesn't own Bloomberg, yet, everyone knows that he owns them.

In the context of GameStop, RC wrote a letter then took a position and started making changes by first removing the deadweight and cleaning up the board.

This is what I mean about ownership. It's actually influence.

Influence is control and the person making the moves controls what leadership does.

To take it a step further:

1. Computershare actively participated in SS forums in an attempt to blurr the lines on DRIP plan which was later confirmed to allow FTDs until Heatlamp DD closed the loophole
2. In another instance, Computershare once glitched and removed all 2FA securities after Reddit went down in ""cybersecurity"" breach. Why didn't this reset Fidelity's 2FA which was actively DRSing shares? Perhaps its because Fidelity owns Reddit after they made a multi-million dollar investment into Reddit. Fidelity doesn't own Reddit, yet it does.
3. Lastly, Computershare president once confirmed shares could be sold up to $2M but later reverted back to a limit.

The question becomes is Computershare ape-friendly? From their actions, I would say no.

So the second question becomes, if they aren't friendly then who is pulling the strings and influencing control? Perhaps the guys that own them with a big stake, like BNY Mellon, the same company that bought $BBBY's transfer agent AST.

Probably a cohencidence that BNY Mellon went out of its way to purchase and control the transfer agents when it was on the losing side of the trades for $GME and $BBBYQ.

I hope this clears up the confusion in the word ownership.

This is where I drew my conclusion:  [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/computershare-completes-acquisition-of-bny-mellon-shareowner-services-136582478.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/computershare-completes-acquisition-of-bny-mellon-shareowner-services-136582478.html)

Here is additional context from the source article:

""This \[BNY Mellon\] is **strategically the most significant acquisition** Computershare has made, and we have made many,"" said Stuart Crosby, CEO and President of Computershare Limited. ""It goes directly toward our goal of remaining the global leader in shareholder servicing.""

A deal works both ways so when Computershare acquired BNY Mellon, then that means BNY Mellon also acquired Computershare.

Influence and control."

**Memory transcription subject: Specialist Angela ""Songbird"" Haverbrook, UN Armed Forces Infiltrator, UNS Gossamer**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: March 24, 2137*

âGO GO GO!â

The Gossamer had barely touched down and her assault ramps yawned wide, disgorging her cargo of raiders. I was one of the first off the ship, racing forward to cover the critical no-man's land. Lambchop's drones sheltered me as I leapt into an occupied foxhole, quickly killing the kolshian defenders inside.

Behind us, the dozen Beachmasters used their limited firepower for what it was actually meant for, raking strong points and Kolshian troop concentrations with direct fire. UNS Quincy, Texas, and Rodney provided heavy support from above. Where we couldn't get to it, and the Beachmasters couldn't hit it, the ortillery flattened it.

â*Invincibilis to all raidersâ* the colonel's voice came over the network as he charges forward with us, his bec de corbin already gleaming violet. *âThese ground-pounders may have mass, but each of you guys are worth a hundred of them. Show them what VIOLENCE means! FOR TERRA!â*

âSOL INVICTUS! Let's make a door, Spike, Quietus, with me!â

â*Tweet tweet, Songbird.â*

â*What you gonna sing for us today, beautiful?â*

I smiled. Even on the battlefield these two could still banter. âI'm taking requests!â Another defender rushed towards me and I put him down with two shots to his chest. âAnyone got any?â

â*You're always playing Queen of Shadow.â*

I turned up the gain on my transmitter. Sure, it was awful radio discipline, but I didn't care and this was too good of a stage to pass up. I mean, the whole Galaxy would hear of this. âAlright, but only if you sing backup.â

â*Kick it!â*

I stabbed another kolshian and wrenched my blade out his side. We'd made it to one of the entryways into the base and Spike started to set the explosives. Regulars from Fire Team Zulu stacked up on either side of the door as we worked, defending our position.

[âGrief of yesterday](https://youtu.be/-2C1SRbxZrE?si=wLJU8wAddHpIH4H4)  
Wrapping me so tightly in the darkness  
Crowning me in flameâ

â*Never drown...â*

Spike motioned he was ready, and we stood back. He hit the detonator, and the outer door blew open. The three of us quickly moved to the inner door and set to work on it.

""The river running in the underworld  
It never drowns the queen of mourning  
Embracing pain of sorrow ill-deserved  
I know you will never understand it...â

Spike signaled again that he was ready, and we moved back a second time. I drew my first set of blades and made ready for the breach. With a nod, Spike hit the detonator again, and before the smoke cleared my drones were through with me a half step behind them.

â*All the chaos of your dreams*  
C*ast it away to rule over the darkness'*  
*shadows to enslaveunder your reignâ*

The kolshians inside were ready for us, and I was washed in a wave of plasma and flame. The shield from the drones deflected a large portion of it, and I felt the circulators kick in my heat sinks. It would have been enough to stop the regulars, but I was a raider. I tossed a grenade to the left and slashed to the right.

âYou want to get inside my head?  
You want to see the Queen of Shadow  
Into the flood of dark you can't descendâ

â*Never drown...â*

Quietus and Spike were through now, laying down a hail of automatic fire and grenades. They kept my flanks clear, and I worked the middle, driving through the defenders. The regulars were right behind us, filling in, adding their own rifles to the mix.

âBearing a light you're pushing through  
Setting the shadows looseâ

â*Leave me to the undertideâ*

â*TO THE UNDERTIDE! NEVER DROWN!â*

It was a chorus now. Voices from Fire Team Zulu joined Spike and Quietus as they cheered me on, driving me faster. Harder.

I reveled in the carnage!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Memory transcription subject: Gunnery Sargent Lewis Chamberlain, Fire Team Zulu**

The three raiders cleared a path for us, fighting like beings possessed by the fallen angels of hell. I didn't know their name, or their rank. Only their call-signs: Songbird, Quietus, Spike. We had been briefed on these raiders, and honestly, I didn't believe half of what we were told. Now, seeing them in action it was clear we were only told half of what was reality.

Their armor shrugged plasma and flames. Their firepower was equal to my whole fire team. And the one called Songbird seemed to dance through the enemy as if she were at a ball. If it wasn't for her singing as if she were in some sort of trance, I would have called her ballerina instead.

I could have sworn I knew her voice from somewhere, like I had heard it months before. The song she was singing was definitely something my whole team was familiar with. We sang it with her, which seemed to empower her more.

As we finished clearing out the entry hall, we were joined by Fire Team Bravo. The three raiders each tapped their right ears, and within seconds they were gone, each headed in a different direction.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Memory transcription subject: Specialist Angela ""Songbird"" Haverbrook, UN Armed Forces Infiltrator**

Quietus tore off down the East hall, while Spike set to work on the next breach for the fire teams. I went West, headed towards Paladin's position. He was trying to hold a position so that Dust-Off could collect wounded. Wounded that would die if Paladin was overrun.

I thought of Lambchop.

I sprinted faster.

[*I'll keep looking, I'll turn every stone for you*](https://youtu.be/6pzVkvrXCHI?si=aLli_wyWNCCNTmHZ)  
*Every night, I cry in agony for you*  
*It's like you call, again and again*  
*Inside my soul I hear you calling*

\---

&#x200B;

**Memory transcription subject: Chaplain Alexander ""Paladin"" Anderson, UN Armed Forces Infiltrator**

It was getting difficult to breathe. The air was hot, my armor was breached in several places, and my heat sinks were leaking coolant. Perhaps my God seeking to teach me humility once more. My Lord did battle with the fires of hell for three days after his crucifixion, but I could not last for barely one hour.

Still, if I was to be forsaken, I would not die in vain. There were souls behind me that I would protect until my last dying breath.

â*Heavy clouds hanging on us...*  
*But no one is bringing you down!â*

Suddenly, with a violence I had not thought possible, an angel of our Lord burst forth from the door on the other side of the room. A dark savior, with a body wreathed in flame, and a white Fleur de Lys on her breastplate. One which I had placed there.

Songbird the White Rose threw herself into the enemy!

â*So loud the voice in my head*  
*Vigilante might not be dead*  
*Couldn't confess all my heart*  
*The rainbow it was just the start*â

Her terrible swift sword flashed, and violet blood was scattered about the room. The kolshians that had been trying to burn me out from my position turned to face the new threat but now they were caught between two raiders. As Songbird slashed, and my colt barked, I could see her look towards me, and she shouted, âIs there heaven?â

I could feel the temperature coming down, and I grit my teeth against the pain, reloading as the Kolshians fell back and organized for another push. Songbird made her way to me, the three drones forming a wall behind her.

âPaladin, you're wounded!â

âIt's... not that bad...â I lied. The truth was that my armor was pretty much holding me together, auto-compressing over half a dozen wounds and keeping me from bleeding out.

âThe hell it's not. Jesus Christ, Chaplain, how are you still standing?â

âBlasphemy, Songbird?â

âAdd it to my next confession. Listen, I'll hold this spot. You get to Dust-Off.â Before I could argue, Songbird slapped the emergency beacon on my pack and gave me a shove. Plasma and fire were already splashing off the shield from her drones as I stumbled into a limping run.

*I keep hiding this feeling I have for you*  
*I got regrets 'bout what I was meant to do*  
*It's like you call again and again*  
*Inside my head I'm going crazy!*

I watched Paladin stumble down the hall and clenched my blades tightly. I crouched, raised my own shield, and leapt. The kolshians hit me with fire as soon as I left my cover, but unlike Paladin, my armor was intact, and I knew I could take it.

I thought about the wounds that Paladin had, and how Lambchop had died, and I could feel the rage building in my heart. There was some satisfaction as my blades bit into Kolshian flesh. Tentacles didn't offer much resistance to the absurdly sharp metal, but sometimes I hit something harder. It shouldn't have been as enjoyable as it was.

The Kolshians seemed endless, and I could feel my muscles burning. Fighting this way had it's limits and one of them was my own endurance. I needed to rest, but I couldn't afford to.

*So loud the voice in my head*  
*Vigilante might not be dead*  
*Couldn't confess all my heart*  
*The rainbow it was just the start*

Stab. Step. Turn left. Parry, glue the blade. Slash right.

Getting tired.

A misstep.

Feel shots bounce off my right shoulder. Let them spin me as I slide my blades.

*Is there heaven?*

Not here...

And then suddenly there was no one left to kill. I was surrounded by bodies, but none of them moved. I staggered to a wall in what looked like a defensible corner and put my back to it, feeling my knees giving way. This would normally be the part where Lambchop would check my vitals, make sure my heart wasn't about to explode or anything. Without him here, I had to do the dirty work myself. I pulled out the medical pad and read it. Several of the numbers were in red.

âSongbird to Paladin... You make it?â

â*Yes my child, thank you. Looks like I'm out of the fight though. Are you ok?â*

âFor now. Is Holiday with you?â One of the raider medics, Holiday would be able to help me figure this out...

â*Yeah, he's working on my left leg right now.â*

âGreat. Ask him what I'm supposed to do about... lactic... acidosis?â I took a pull from my hydration pack and instantly felt like my mouth was being aggressively screwed by a fizzy lemon. Seriously, who comes up with these flavors?

â*This is Holliday.* *Good to see you're still up, Songbird. Increase your Oh-Two flow by ten percent. You hydrating? I think we set you up with super sprite.â*

âYeahâ I took another long drink as I adjusted my oxygen scrubber, and suddenly realized I had to burp very loudly. âUgh, that what you call this sludge?â

â*Don't knock it, it's got a sodium bicarbonate mixture formulated to your body chemistry. You feeling better?â*

âA bit, thanks Holiday.â

â*No problem, Songbird. Hey, since I have you, relaying a message from Immortalis. Several fire teams have gone missing two levels down from your position. The old man says you're it.â*

âOf course, he did. No rest for the weary.â I picked myself up from the floor and steadied myself. Walking over some of the corpses, I scavenged a federation standard plasma rifle, as well as a sidearm and several power packs.

I moved to the where the first down lift was marked on my map but hesitated. It would be too easy to take the direct route, and if there was a strong hostile down there I'd be walking right into it. I needed an alternate path. And there was one, but it would take me through a lot more kolshian mooks. Well, there was something to be said for that too. I set the new route on my map and moved out.

Cutting through patrols was easy enough, but as I made my way down the first set of stairs I wasn't prepared for what I found on the next level. There were dead coalition soldiers here. A lot of them. Many of them had been burned to death. Worse, the bodies weren't just sitting there, they had been arranged as if in some cruel twisted warning. That was ominous...

I stalked forward and found the first silver suits. Exterminators, working in a squad of five. Their flamers were much more potent than the standard kolshian line infantry, but I had dealt with exterminators before.

[*Watch out in your emotion*](https://youtu.be/dSeR1rluQ8c?si=LwPjTSzXDeWbEstH)  
*Throw down all your stones*  
*Keep out far from underland*  
*Don't fall down again*

I stepped out from behind my cover and laid down a burst from my pilfered plasma rifle dropping the first pair before rushing the rest of the squad. I drew my blades as I charged, not giving them time to bring their flamers against me. They were fast though, and skilled. I used my shoulder to smash the first one to the ground then slashed at the second. He parried, while the third tried to wrap me up with his tentacle arms around my legs. I wasn't having any of that and quickly stabbed one of the offending limbs.

Frustration began to set in as steel rang against steel in a staccato rhythm, but I had made a mistake. The exterminator I knocked to the ground turned his flamer on me and the two exterminators still brawling, and I felt a wave of heat wash over me. This was hotter though than any exterminator fire I remember though, and from a single flamer! My heat sinks screamed as the other two exterminators tried to back away from me.

*You can rage, you can fight, storm the gates of Hell*  
*By your anger you'll be swallowed*  
*Lose yourself in the fray of a red-lit haze*  
*And awaken shame and sorrow*

My drones imposed themselves between me and the attack, and I instantly felt cooler. With a quick slash I finished off the wounded exterminator, then stabbed his companion while he fumbled with his own flamer before turning to the one back on the ground. Suddenly there was an almost inaudible âwhumpâ and I was thrown against the far wall as his own pack exploded, consuming him. My drones clattered to the ground around me before taking to the air again, two of them visibly damaged and trailing sparks.

The fuck?!

I shook myself off, counted the pieces to make sure nothing was broken. I was definitely sore though. And parched. And I felt like I had a sunburn everywhere. I took another pull from my hydration pack as I moved to investigate one of the dead exterminators, the cool liquid helping to focus my dulled senses. I rolled him over and looked at the flamer fuel tank. It was black, not red, and the label said something like âbanefireâ on it. I snapped a few quick images and sent them off to Immortalis before collecting myself.

Had to keep moving.

Down the hall I found more carnage. Another fire team had clashed with more exterminators here. A half dozen dead humans, and just as many kolshans. Two live exterminators were âcleaning upâ, burning the bodies. I knew better this time, drawing the plasma pistol and taking careful aim from the shadows. They hadn't noticed me yet, so I took my time.

*Can't hide from your damnation*  
*Your crimes are your own*  
*Black eyes watch from Underland*  
*To drag you down again*

I took a slow breath, steadying myself, aiming for the top of the black tank on the further exterminator's back. I squeezed the firing stud, and the plasma bolt struck the tank square. It detonated with a flash and a rolling violet flame that filled the room. A half second later, the other Kolshian's tank exploded, and I shielded myself as the heat washed over me. As soon as the flames died down I pushed through.

*Don't fall into madness*  
*Don't follow the black rabbit*  
*Don't go down that hole now*  
*Nothing can erase thÐµ fallout*

*Down below devils pray*  
*And angels cursÐµ holy ways*  
*Upside down, inside out*  
*Nothing right or sane can be found*

Another exterminator squad was coming to investigate the explosions, and I slid into another shadow, hiding as they tromped past me. When the last one cleared me, I leaped out. My arm wrapped around him and my blade slid between his ribs, plunging into his heart, and killing him instantly. I swiftly moved to the next in line, and plunged my left blade into his leg, slicing through the kolshian equivalent of the femoral artery. I slashed the fuel cable to his flamer as he screamed, dropping him in a bleeding pile. The other three were slow on the uptake, just starting to turn.

*You can rage, you can fight, storm the gates of Hell*  
*By your anger you'll be swallowed*  
*Lose yourself in the fray of a red-lit haze*  
*And awaken shame and sorrow*

I was on the third before he even half turned, slicing through his tentacles and the fuel line to his flamer. His eyes went wide as I grabbed him and held him in front of me, stabbing through him into number four. The final exterminator leapt to the side of my bull-rush, triggering his flamer. The gout of violet flame scorched my left shoulder and the tips of my shoulder spikes slagged as I fell to my right, shoving the bodies away. He swung the flamer at me, my armor glowing cherry red. Desperately, I threw one of my blades as hard as I could. Out of pure luck it pierced his face plate, skewering his head. The exterminator fell back, dead.

*Shame and sorrow*

I stood up, my armor smoldering. The heat sinks were at their limit, and I couldn't afford to take another hit from that stuff. The hell did they make it from anyways?

There was a door at the end of the next hall. According to my map there should be a large chamber behind it, but who knew what was inside. I waited for my armor to cool just a little more, and set my drones in front of me, letting them build up their shields. The damaged drones lagged badly on their charge, so I used the extra few moments to check my blades. My left blade was still razor sharp but the right blade was chipped and had cracks forming. I quickly swapped them in my hands, took a deep breath, and hit the door.

Inside was an armory, where a dozen exterminators were equipping themselves. I made my decision instantly, charging into the room with a scream. Half suited exterminators looked up in panic.

*Don't fall, don't fall down that hole again*  
*For you will break more than you can mend*  
*Rise up above the fell haze of red*  
*Laying that deadly nature to rest*

*You can rage, you can fight, storm the gates of Hell*  
*By your anger you'll be swallowed*  
*Lose yourself in the fray of a red-lit haze*  
*And awaken shame and sorrow...*

The human was slaughtering her way through my people. Even other so called âraidersâ had fallen far easier than this one, and she was proving most persistent.

As she cleared the armory, I saw her coming down the hallway towards me. She stopped when she saw my gold suit, recognizing my rank. I knew she would be after me, so it wasn't difficult to get her to follow me.

There was more than one way to kill a predator. If she wouldn't die to plasma bolts, flames, or knives...

"Alright, Let's Talk About the 3rd Pick & a Potential Siakam Trade With Portland",torontoraptors,13yqui7,2023-06-02 17:59:58,161,0.77,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/13yqui7/alright_lets_talk_about_the_3rd_pick_a_potential/,CazOnReddit,ANALYSIS,"So have you heard that the Blazers are looking to shop around the 3rd pick and Anfernee Simons for a star forward?  Yeah, let's finally get into this.

The Blazers lucked themselves into a rather unique position, both with the pick they got - having jumped from 5th to 3rd in the draft - and with the team who managed to get the 2nd pick being the Charlotte Hornets who are likely to draft forward Brandon Miller over G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson, with Scoot seemingly falling to 3.

This would make Scoot the 2nd young guard the Blazers recently drafted and their 3rd under 25 guard to play next to Dame...if they weren't trying to shop the pick around.

They have a perfect opportunity to finally do a rebuild...and yet, here we are with yet another rumor about the Blazers trying to build around Dame and get him the help they've left him without for...what, 8 seasons and counting?  Like [the Rockets who are alleged to be interested in moving the 4th pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/13pn4ye/fine_lets_talk_about_the_4th_pick_a_trade_with/), I don't think the Blazers really should be trying to do a two timelines, pseudo rebuild while contending around Lillard.

I also don't think the package they can put together is as great as it's often hyped up to be.  As we'll get into, a package around Anfernee and the 3rd pick plus a player or pick or two is quite decent in a vacuum but it certainly isn't good enough to get to get you that Top 10-15 player in the league who can singlehandedly win you a series - if not, a championship.  It certainly isn't enough to outbid the likes of the Jazz or, more significantly, the Thunder who may opt for a splash in the offseason as their core develops into a young, hungry playoff team with some greater veteran presence around them.

I'm just going to say it:  If Portland really is saying ""time's up"" and putting together one last effort to compete against Dame, they need to do more than get Siakam, O.G., Karl-Anthony Towns or whichever star's name pops up in rumors leading up to the draft.  Not to say those players won't improve the team, but none of them - and yes i'm including Siakam - are good enough to elevate a former lottery team like the Blazers over the past 2 seasons to a Top 3 seed, let alone guarantee a championship.

A duo of Siakam and Dame, Dame and KAT, etc. can be *part* of one's core championship team but they need the right supporting pieces around them in order to win.  To put it mildly, the Blazers...do not have that.  Jusuf Nurkic has seen significant regression as a defender and the bench is one of the few to make the Raptors bench look like a bastion of basketball greatness.  It shows on the floor and statistically, and it's a large reason why the Blazers have been one of the worst defensive teams in the league over the past, one of the worst when it comes to rebounding and in general being near the bottom of the Western Conference before they pulled the plug on their most recent season in an attempt to tank for a Top 4 pick.

If the Blazers are actually going to commit to Dame, they need to engage in a paradigm shift this offseason.  Rework the starting 5, the bench and go all-in getting Loyalty McLoyal the team he should have had around him for years instead of endlessly running it back with minor tweaks to who his #2 is.

That means either getting your pick back from the Bulls and shopping the 4 firsts/3 swaps you can or removing the protections and dealing out the 3/3 you would have to improve the roster.  Don't just get Siakam, KAT or whoever and set them up to fail with Damian because it's not fair to either player to put them in that situation.

Go after Buddy Hield, see if Myles Turner or Clint Capela are going to be available, or if the Wolves are desperate enough to sign and trade Naz Reid to recoup some assets after the costly Gobert trade - if not, try signing him with the full MLE.  And you don't stop there!  However they plan to shake up the roster in this hypothetical scenario, they need to significantly improve the center position/rotation and their bench to give Dame an actual chance of winning a ring with what few years left they have in his prime.

Also fire Chauncey Billups, he's a bottom 3 coach and the only reason I can't say he is not the worst is because I can't say the Raptors coach will be objectively worse/better without knowing who will head either team.  He isn't 3rd, that's for sure.

But anyway that's the Blazers prerogative.  What exactly could the Raptors see in a potential pick that, presumably, revolves around Pascal Siakam?

Since I can be a bit of a wordy writer, i'm going to add some **TL;DR** sections for each player/pick discussed in this little piece for those that want a quick breakdown.

Note:   ***This is not a trade proposal; this is a compilation of the assets and players who could be included in a trade for Pascal Siakam***. ***Additionally, this is not an endorsement of trading Pascal Siakam, etc. in a deal with the Portland Trailblazers.***

**Anfernee Simons**

https://preview.redd.it/eon5unll7d3b1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2873b3d89092d0e0c221ee9817335918489f2e7e

The main player who's been the subject of a contentious discussion between Blazers fans and Raptors fans.  Whether you think he's overrated, underrated or somewhere inbetween, it is undeniable that Anfernee Simons would have to be included in the trade at minimum.

I can't speak for the Blazers and I won't pretend to speak for all Raptors fans so let me just say this:  *I like Anfernee Simons*.  He's one of the more exciting players in the league under 25 even if he doesn't have the same ceiling as a guy like Zion or fellow player nicknamed ""Ant"" Anthony Edwards.

A borderline All-Star guard with a combination of shooting prowess and explosiveness, he had a breakout season in 2021/22 when Dame went down due to an injury and thus became the Blazers lead point guard in his absence.  He's a genuine 3-level scorer who can splash from outside, pressure the rim for a high-flying dunk and he's effective in the midrange too.  If nothing else, it cannot be overstated how nice it would be for this team to have another player who's a reliable, 38.7% from 3 volume shooter on a roster so thoroughly lacking in outside shooting

And before you say it, yes, **Anfernee Simons is a point guard**.  This isn't a case like CJ where his skillset is that of a 2 who can do some playmaking but shouldn't run your offense, Simons does have some issues with dribbling the air out of the ball before making a pass, but he is a point guard.  He isn't a typical point, operating more as a shoot-first point like Lillard, but he's still capable of cracking out a notable number of assists while getting buckets; he dished out 6 dimes a game with nearly 28 points in the games he's played without Dame as the lead point.

All 11 of them last year.

https://preview.redd.it/nwhosg3d8d3b1.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d01cd6a71d032cf5e3bab941c00fc942148991c

Yeah, you might have seen some posts or stats online of what Simons has done without Damian Lillard; in his breakout season of 2021/22, the Anferno was putting up a similar number of assists and cracked 20 points per game, albeit over a more significant sample size of 30 games.  And in 2022/23, Anfernee Simons put up 27.9/2.9/5.7 (2.4 turnovers so an AST/TO of 2.38:1 which is solid) while shooting a staggering 41% from 3 on 11 3s.

Those numbers are impressive in a vacuum; his true shooting of 62% is especially notable.  However, they require some context and should be taken with an enormous grain of salt.

For one, it's a very small sample size over a lengthy period of the season where teams haven't had to plan for Simons to be the main guard to focus their defense on.  He's still the 2nd option so it's not like there's no film watching or the like, but if Anfernee Simons permanently becomes the lead point guard of a team, opposing teams will gameplan around him and his weaknesses more significantly than the very few times where he's asked to be the lead ballhandler in Dame's absence.

His 2021/22 stats, while still a limited overall sample size, do suggest he'll be able to dish out a similar number of dimes as the lead guard (Dame had been ruled out due to injury during the season so teams did have to gameplan around the Ant for a large portion of the season instead of a handful of games scattered throughout the season) and he still has room to grow as a playmaker but once again, it was only a sample size of 30 games so it is hard to draw much out from the games he played.

Speaking of drawing conclusions from said sample size:  Yes the Blazers went 4-7 within that 11 game sample size - and bear in mind this sample included games where the Blazers were still trying to contend while facing a variety of teams i.e. not every team was a playoff or contender.  That isn't great, however, Ant was generally not the main reason they lost since the 2022/23 Blazers as a whole were pretty terrible all year, even before they blatantly tanked.  The same is also true of his breakout year when the Blazers lost Lillard due to injury, they just weren't a good team.

If there is a point of contention around Simons that one can draw from his past 2 seasons, it's his defense which...it's bad.

It's really bad.

He's improved this season on that end to the point where i'd say he's a better defender than Dame - even if his overall defensive rating doesn't support this, the eye test does - but that's like saying Spencer Dinwiddie is a better defender than Trae Young.  While Chauncey Billups hasn't been doing either one of Portland's guard any favors, it doesn't change the fact that being better than one of the worst defenders in the league is not an accomplishment to be proud of.  All coaching issues aside, Simons is still a notable negative on that end of the floor.  He has a propensity for losing his man via ball watching, he's not great at closing out on the perimeter and he's not a lane disruptor by any means.  It's not impossible for him to improve as a defender - he's 6'3 with a 6'9 wingspan and much of his defensive weaknesses come from a lack of discipline - but as of right now when his shots aren't falling he's a major liability on the court and his flaws on defense were not well hidden when paired next to another notably poor defender in Dame.

There are a couple of other habits that Simons needs to address - he could stand to be less trigger happy as a scorer and work more on his playmaking given all the promise he's shown in that area - but that's the main issue with Simons.  He's a very skilled guard with a similar approach to the game as Dame on both ends of the floor.  And we all know Dame isn't locking down the opposing team's point.

Does Anfernee Simons seem like he'll become a guard on the level of Dame?  No but that's a ridiculously high bar to hold him to, especially with the limited opportunities he had and will continue to have when he's behind Dame in the guard pecking order.  Anfernee is a good player who often shows glimmers of true greatness on offense but whose defense (or lack thereof) is going to require very careful teambuilding to limit exploiting said defense in the playoffs.  Perhaps he'll need to be the full-time point to fully achieve his potential as a playmaker but while he doesn't scream All-NBA caliber, he's someone you can easily see eking out a couple of All-Star nods at his peak and is, at worst, a staring-caliber guard.  As for whether he can be the lead of a championship contender...we'll get to that when we talk about the pick he'd come with.

**TL;DR -** *Anfernee Simons is an intriguing young player with upside as an explosive, shoot-first PG but one whose poor defense does mean the team's starting lineup/bench has to be built around carefully to account for his current (and likely ongoing throughout his career) weaknesses.*

**3rd Pick**

https://preview.redd.it/96pocramhi3b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ee450641a298a5b1dee0da9fce0c7f652c60665

It's whomever is left from **Scoot Henderson** or **Brandon Miller**.  Maybe you trade down to 4 for some more assets if you're a believer in **Amen Thompson**, maybe you take Amen if you think he's the best player available and the Rockets won't negotiate for Scoot/Miller but yeah, it's one of those three via the 3rd overall pick.

Before we get into the players, I do want to briefly mention that I actually did a post a while ago on a different sub going over [trades involving the 3rd pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13jq7qc/the_blazers_want_to_trade_their_pick_to_help_dame/) and to put it bluntly:  The 3rd pick has good value but it doesn't have as much value on its own and trades involving the 3rd pick for an All-Star or even All-NBA caliber player are very rare.

The closest trade to what the Blazers would want in return was in 2000 where the Atlanta Hawks traded the 3rd overall pick to the Vancouver Grizzlies along with Brevin Knight and Lorenzen Wright for Shareef Abdur-Rahim and the 27th overall pick.  That 3rd pick turned out to be future HoFer Pau Gasol but no one knew he'd become that at the time.  As for what the Grizzlies gave up for the pick, Shareef Abdur-Rahim was not a perennial All-Star nor was he an All-NBA level player.  He was a solid player that became an All-Star in his debut season for the Hawks...and that was his only All-Star appearance.

With that in mind, it is a bit wild that it's so commonly suggested that Simons and the 3rd pick alone should be enough to acquire an All-NBA talent like Siakam, especially with how much inflation we've seen in trades for players of that caliber of late or even players who are a step below.  Concerns about his contract expiring lowering his value are baffling, as if a team's front office wouldn't talk to him about an extension before making such a trade.  Moreover, it's not like the Raptors need to deal him out when they can simply re-sign him in 2024.

Now this year, when Scoot Henderson or Brandon Miller could be up for grabs, the 3rd pick has a lot more value given how highly praised those players are, so let's put aside the debate on what is fair for Siakam for a moment and talk about the presumed 3rd overall pick, Scoot Henderson.

The 2nd best player in a draft class containing the best prospect since LeBron James.  He's projected to go 3rd because Charlotte is allegedly interested in taking Brandon Miller at 2nd but we'll touch on that later.  For now, let's talk Scoot:

* Henderson is a freakish athlete and a terrific floor general; he racked up an average of 6 assists a night on an AST:TO ratio of 1.94:1 and is a strong option on offense due to his abilities as a slasher
* His usage as the G-League Ignite's offense, be it ball screens or handoffs, displayed his ability to break down a team's defense
   * To delve deeper into his production as an offensive guard, his percentage rate of ball screens (43.7%) is only matched or surpassed by 7 players across the entire NBA.  **7**!
* Despite the athleticism, Scoot is generally good at controlling the ball and not turning it over due to  careless mistakes driving to the basket
* For a guard, he's a pretty solid rebounder and, if nothing else, he puts in the effort on defense even if he's not necessarily someone who screams ""Future DPoY""
* Intangibles are hard to really quantify but Scoot is the definition of someone who ""has that dog in him"" and he's someone you trust down the stretch to make the right move
* He puts in effort on defense but he's only 6'2 with a 6'9 wingspan and, well he's no Kyle Lowry when it comes to taking charges or the like
* His shooting is...a work-in-progress; he tends to default to long 2s which he isn't great at making (38% overall), his free throw percentage is only 75% and his 3-point shooting is a measly 31% off the dribble

Needless to say, there's a lot to like about Scoot; if Victor wasn't in this draft, he'd easily go #1 overall.  He's often compared to Derrick Rose or even Russell Westbrook as this uber explosive guard who can seriously pressure the rim while generating solid passes for his teammates which is a good comparison though one obviously hope his outside shooting pans out more like Curry or Trae than Russ or Rose.

Losing Siakam would obviously hurt the team in the short term but as far as what Scoot brings, there is a lot of upside to him that would raise the ceiling of the team in the long run.  His ability to get to the rim, combined with his athleticism would make him the perfect guard for a team that thrives in transition like the Raptors.  He would also have chemistry with another player the Raptors have been rumored to be interested in/may take at 13 in Leonard Miller as they played on the same team but we'll talk about the 13th pick's potential prospects another time.

For now, let's go over one of the problems with trading for Scoot Henderson if he is still on the board, besides the obvious hypothetical of ""he might never become a player as good as the one you're giving up"" or ""what do you do with Fred when you brought in Scoot and Simons"" because what you're really asking is this:  **Is a backcourt of Scoot/Simons the team's guard duo of the future**?

This brings me to my big problem with a âtrade for Simons + 3â trade if the 3rd pick does end up being Scoot:Â  A backcourt of two undersized guards, one of whom is unproven against NBA competition on defense and the other of whom has been one of the worst guard defenders in the league is not a duo of guards you can build a contender around in the long-term unless both of them become significantly improved defenders.  Or at the very least, it's a duo that has historically not led to notable championship contention.

Blazers fans would know this well given their team has only had one year where they werenât the in the NBAâs basement as far as defensive ratings go, be it with CJ or Anfernee as Lillardâs sidekick; the furthest they ever got with either was the Western Conference Finals and the best their defense has even been was 10th.  Every other season, the Trailblazers defense has been amongst the worst in the NBA.  Part of those Blazers teams' failures can be attributed to bad coaching, but a more significant portion of the blame be laid at the feet of Dame being a bad defender and undersized who has been paired with bad, undersized guards throughout much of his career.

You can get away with one bad defender or a starter whoâs undersized for their position on a championship-caliber team which, if youâre rebuilding by trading away Siakam, that is what youâre hoping to take a step back for.  As an example, Dirk Nowitzki wasnât known for being a lockdown defender and yet the Mavericks won their first and only championship to date with Dirk as the weak link on defense.  He was also a phenomenal offensive talent whose weaknesses on defense were mitigated by how much momentum he was able to generate for his team but I digress.

You can get away with running several smaller players for a limited time to force mismatches on offense with the right lineup.Â  The Warriors dynasty comes to mind, where Golden State would close games using their âDeath Lineupâ.Â  However, that lineup revolved around 4 Hall of Famers (Klay, Dray, Steph, Igoudala) where Steph is the lineupâs weakest link on defense, and this is before we acknowledge that they were able to include yet another HoFer in Kevin Durant to replace Harrison Barnes in a different incarnation of the Death Lineup from 2017 onward.

For that matter, it's not wholly impossible to win a championship with a duo of small guards - the Pistons repeated in the 89/90-90/91 with 6'3 Joe Dumars and 6'1 Isiah Thomas and the Bad Boy Pistons were contenders throughout the 90s - but it is damn near impossible if your lead guards are bad defenders.  Whatever can be said about Thomas' various off-court controversies, notably with him being found liable for sexual misconduct during his stint heading a woman's basketball team a la the New York Liberty, he was a phenomenal defender, as was Dumars.

Hell, the Raptors won in 2019 while having Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry share the floor a fair amount of time in the Finals though it is once again worth noting that both were terrific defenders at the time.  Even if one wouldn't call their efforts All-Defense caliber, they were both positives on that end of the floor.

Historically speaking, **you cannot be a championship-caliber team with two of your starters being undersized negatives on the defensive end barring them being surrounded by generational defenders or said starters being generational offensive players who can make up for how many points youâre giving up on the other end of the floor**.Â 

Simons is a gifted scorer with good playmaking but is a truly sorry defender.  Scoot Henderson is a talented passer but is undersized for the position and how he fares defensively with teams hunting him as the smallest player on the court will remain to be seen.  But with neither of them likely to be a Dumars/Thomas-level defender and the offensive capabilities for one of them being the main question mark as to how good a player they could become, having both of them as the foundation to your team's backcourt seems to cement the duo's future as a non-contending entity.

Let's put this into perspective with some statistics:Â  Of the past 40 years, the *only* championship to ever be won by a team with what could be considered a bad regular season defensive rating was the 2000/01 Lakers.  That team had two generational talents in Shaq and Kobe, and that season is itself an outlier when compared to the rest of the Shaq/Kobe Lakers era that it shouldn't even count.  All other championship teams were at least 12th or higher for their season with most championship teams being in the Top 5 in defensive rating.

By the by, in case you're wondering:  That team who had 12th in defensive rating was the 1995 Rockets led by the generational talent in Hakeem Olajuwon and said rating had a lot to do with untimely injuries to the 95 Rockets core.  That team they still managed to have the 7th best offensive rating in the league despite Drexler's absence for much of the season is a testament to Future Raptors Retiree Hakeem's skills as the best big man of the late 80s, early-to-mid 90s.  Are we noticing a pattern here?

Even if we ignore the question about what to do with Fred, the question of what the Raptors backcourt looks like is far more pertinent if it is going to involve some combination of Scoot Henderson and Anfernee Simons with, presumably, Gary Trent Jr. and another guard coming off the bench for relief.  Is a backcourt of Anfernee Simons and Scoot going to turn this team into a Top 3-6 offense for the season without plummeting this team's defense off of a cliff?  And if you don't think so, when do you move one of them to open up the 1 or the 2 for another player?

This is a question the team will likely have to answer once they've seen how Simons and Scoot fit together/fit with the rest of the roster; I don't see a 3-team draft day deal where Simons or the 3rd pick are moved elsewhere barring that aforementioned moving down to 4th and I don't see this team without Siakam/with Scoot and Simons being a serious contender for several years even if they do pan out.  But it is a question that has me concerned in regards to how this team will function when it's developing a dynamic duo of players who will be picked apart in the playoffs barring one of them turning into a terrific defender.

Whatever else one can say about Point Scottie or even Scottie Barnes when he was crammed into the starting Shooting Guard position for much of the year, it is hard to argue that  having either Scottie or Trent & Simons/Scoot as your backcourt makes way more sense defensively even if having both Scottie and Scoot complicates matters on the offensive end since neither are great shooters and Trent's defense is a touch overrated at time due to is propensity to gamble for steals.

All this being said, it's not out of the realm of possibility that Henderson becomes an All-Defense-caliber player or for Simons to a climb out from the deep hole he's dug for himself as one of the worst defenders in the league, and Scoot is still a phenomenal talent.  These concerns should be noted, but they shouldn't serve to deter from selecting him 3rd if such a trade were to go down.  As a prospect, there's very few players in this draft class who could serve to singlehandedly raise the floor and the ceiling of this team in the long run.

Speaking of other players, however, it should be acknowledged that Scoot isn't the only potentially available player at 3; while all accounts suggest the Hornets prefer Brandon Miller at 3, Scoot is the best player available at 2 and there's no guarantee the Hornets draft for fit.  So here's a quick rundown of Miller and a player the Blazers have recently worked out, Amen Thompson:

* ***Brandon Miller*** is a 6'9 forward (boo, we have enough of those!) who can shoot (yay, we need more of that!) and has some notable playmaking upside even if his decision-making can be questionable at times.  He's a player you could see as either a #1 or a high level #2 option on a championship team though he's not the most switchable guy on defense and you have the usual rookie concerns i.e. ""he needs to get the NBA body to thrive"".  He's gotten a lot of comparisons to Paul George but i'd say his playmaking is further ahead from what PG13 was as a prospect.
* ***Amen Thompson*** is someone [I talked about in the trade for the 4th pick](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/13pn4ye/fine_lets_talk_about_the_4th_pick_a_trade_with/) & he's a very interesting player.  A high ceiling, low floor player with unreal athleticism, a 6'7 lead guard who's arguably the best passer in the draft class but has serious questions about the competition he's faced in OverTime Elite/his shooting being as bad as it was. Think Ja Morant but with defense and, again, at 6'7 with a much longer wingspan.

I feel like the trade makes more sense if the Raptors were to go for Amen or Miller but we won't know who the Hornets will chose on draft night until the day of & ideally you'd trade down for 4th to get Thompson plus assets if you're sold on Amen.  Plus like I said, it is possible that Scoot does become a good or even great defender so one might not have to worry about choosing between him and Ant down the line.

**TL;DR -** *Scoot is an amazing prospect but his pairing with Simons could be a major problem in the future if both don't improve defensively.  Ironically, the 3rd pick becomes simultaneously more valuable for other teams/less valuable for the Raptors if it's Scoot and vice-versa if it's Miller due to those concerns.  Thompson is a wildcard at 3 depending on who has the pick/how willing the Rockets are to trade up to 3rd.*

**Nassir Little**

Portland is reluctant to deal out Sharpe.  We can debate on whether or not it's fair value for an All-NBA caliber player like Siakam, how much his contract being expiring should affect a deal (we'll ignore the fact that he can be extended by Portland and that any front office making a trade like this should be doing their due diligence by speaking to Pascal Siakam beforehand) or how good Sharpe actually was as a rookie overall instead of solely focusing on that stretch where the Blazers let him do whatever because they were tanking but regardless, the Blazers seem intent on keeping him. Fair enough, Masai is likely aiming for more than Anfernee and 3 - especially for the reasons listed above if it is Scoot Henderson - but Sharpe is likely a hard sell for the front office even if they are going all-in i.e. they want to keep at least one young guy on the roster for the long-term.

That being said, there's still the matter of salary matching, and that's where one of Nassir Little or Sharpe has to come in (They're not going to move Nurkic in the deal for Siakam unless they have something lined up for their center situation i.e. tampering for Naz Reid); the only way for the Blazers to neatly absorb Siakam into their cap with just Simons is by renouncing their rights to Jerami Grant and they need to re-sign him/move him to the 3 (Grant is a really bad rebounder for a PF; the man is a career 4 RPG) if they are serious about competing with Dame.

So...yeah, Nassir Little.   Little is what people think O.G. is:  A good defender who is often injured, Little is a solid 3 & D wing who, unlike Anunoby, has never played more than 55 games for a given season.  Granted, 2019/20 and 2020/21 were shorted to 72 seasons but regardless, injuries have hampered the 23 year-old in the same way that Otto Porter Jr.'s potential was sapped due to a career-long battle with injuries.  Still, when considering his age and production, his newest contract ($28M/4 years) is amazing value when he's healthy.

But much like Otto (who I think technically could be sent in such a deal due to the rules around incoming/outgoing salaries), the question of when he's available is a common one.  Little is a good young player but one whom you shouldn't get your hopes up about changing the team's direction.

**TL;DR -** *A little salary (sorry) is needed for the deal to happen on draft night & Nassir would be a decent choice for forward depth off the bench.  One will have to carefully factor in injury concerns when evaluating the team's depth.*

**Keon Johnson**

So like I said, Sharpe is likely to be ruled out.  I debated if I should cover him at all but i'm honestly not sold on Shaedon as a prospect and we've already met the quota for rants with the ""Simons/Scoot frontcourt will be exploited"" talks.  That said, I don't think the Raptors would settle for just Simons and the 3rd pick or the 3rd pick plus assets from a 3rd team were Anfernee moved due to the aforementioned backcourt issues with Simons and Scoot.  For now we have Keon Johnson.

Fun fact:  When the Raptors were expected to draft [7th in the 2021 draft](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/draft/toronto-raptors-mock-draft-tennessee-keon-johnson), Johnson was a common player mocked for the 7th pick.

He wound up going in the 20 to the Clippers (via the Knicks in a trade) who eventually fleeced the Blazers in a deal including him for Norman Powell.

Keon Johnson...hasn't really done a whole lot thus far.  He was noted for having an impressive vertical of 48"" at the 2021 combine which broke a previous record, he's a terrific athlete and he's about the same age as Scottie so he lines up with a rebuild or retool around Barnes...

...and that's where the positives end.  Like I said, Keon hasn't demonstrated all that much on either team he's been on.  For a guard, he's not a great ball handler, he isn't a good shooter, he's got decent size and the speed to be a good defender from 1-3 but his potential on that end does not All-Defense caliber.  He'd be a throw-in that you'd hope can develop over time, likely spending a lot of time in the G-League because as of right now, he isn't going to be a significant contributor on either end.

**TL;DR -** *Keon is on a rookie deal so you'd be taking a flier on him/betting on your development bringing out the best in him if he were included.*

**Other pick(s)**:  As far as immediate draft capital goes, the Blazers have the 23rd pick in this draft, which is around the range where players the Raptors have been rumored to be interested in/interviewed (Bilal Couliby, GG Jackson) would likely be available.  There's been some speculation that the Blazers could send this pick to the Bulls so they can get their owed pick back from Chicago but nothing concrete has come out regarding whether the Bulls would settle for that vs. hoping the Blazers make the 1st round and lose so they can get a pick in the 16-20 range.

That said, the future pick owed to the Bulls is where things get tricky if the Raptors did want a future 1st:  **The Blazers pick is protected until 2028**.  It is technically possible for them to offer a swap in 2029 but without the protections being removed on the Bulls-bound 2024 1st (The 2029 pick cannot be moved due to the Stepien Rule), any future draft capital would need to come in the form of the 2023 trade deadline's currency of choice:  Second round picks.

Some of the notable 2nds include:

* A 2024 2nd that could come from the Hornets or Wolves
* A 2028 Warriors 2nd
* This year's second via the Hawks which is 45th
* The Blazers own 2nd in 2028

Not that these are a good substitute for a first-rounder but with the Blazers draft capital being restricted and the CBA's changes to 2nd round contracts, it's better than no future firsts if the 2023 Knicks pick is considered a bridge too far.

**TL;DR -** *There is some interesting draft capital here beyond their own 1sts, especially if the 23rd pick is available in a deep draft like this, but ideally one would want a future 1st from the Blazers rather than a handful of 2nds given Dame's limited window.*

**Conclusion**

I was originally going to talk about the 4th overall pick too but this got a bit lengthy so I made that into a separate post.  As far as the 3rd pick package, in some ways it's better than one surrounding the 4th pick because Simons is a flatout better player than any one the Rockets would send back but it's also worse when you factor in Simons or Scoot's respective ceilings vs some of the potential prospects that could come in a 4th pick package?

You're getting significant depth at the guard position if it is Scoot/Simons but there's a huge question mark as to how good the defense will hold up with two undersized guards, one of whom is a bad defender, will hold up in the playoffs."

The Return of Jamal Murray: A Deep Dive Into Denver's Second Star.,nbadiscussion,w5fih4,2022-07-22 12:57:27,959,0.99,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/w5fih4/the_return_of_jamal_murray_a_deep_dive_into/,OkAutopilot,Statistical & Video Analysis,"##**How did we get here?**

Jamal Murray is primed to make his return to the court this upcoming season after missing the last season and a half, including two full postseasons, with an ACL tear. Prior to him going down the Nuggets were on a 6-1 run after trading for Aaron Gordon, prompting a [front page Lowe love-fest](https://es.pn/3aW8zKT) and a number of analysts and predictive models to pick Denver as favorites to come out of the West. Not a wholy unreasonable take considering they looked like a top-to-bottom better team than they were less than six months ago as they battled the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. 

While Denver managed to find some success in their post-Murray reality via a Round 1 victory over Portland in 20-21, it was hardly satisfying for a team that felt like had as good of a chance as anyone to compete for a championship that year. Even though Nikola Jokic won the MVP, Murray's injury left a dark cloud hanging over the organization. Maybe that's what was keeping Nuggets games blacked out for the entire state.

Coming into the next season there was optimism that Murray would be back after the All-Star break. That would have brought a much needed boost to an overclocked Nuggets team who nine games into the season found themselves without Michael Porter Jr. as well. Despite continued rumors that Murray was going to make his return as the regular season neared its end, the front office and training staff opted to remain careful with the rehab process of their second in command and not rush him back before he felt he was 100 percent. The Nuggets finished with a 48 win season in in which they set a franchise record for wins on the road, and Nikola Jokic picked up his 2nd MVP in as many years. 

While that's a remarkable achievement on both counts, for the fans and for the team it was another unfortunate postseason marked by incredible play from Nikola Jokic but overshadowed by a great deal of frustration knowing that there is this squad that is spearheaded by the back-to-back MVP entering his prime, blocked off from capably competing until their second and third highest paid and highest scoring players get right.

While it seemed that at least Murray might have been able to play limited minutes, the Nuggets banked on a cautious approach that should lead to a fully healthy and physically stronger version of both of these guys come opening night. Prior to going down Murray was putting together his best season as a pro and one of the more exciting postseason runs of all time, and MPJ was coming off the 2nd most efficient rookie season of all time for players averaging over 17ppg. Second to, of course, Wilt Chamberlain.

Coming back from this much time off can put you out of the mind of a lot of NBA fans, so let's take a look at what Murray was bringing to the table before he went down, and what his return means the Nuggets.

##**Jamal Murray's Scoring** 

No matter how long he's been away, most of you reading this will remember his bubble performance where he put on one of the most exciting postseason runs in recent memory. Say what you will about the bubble, putting up a 3 game stretch against Utah of 50/11/7 on 58/70/100 with no turnovers, 42/8/8 on 65/50/100 with no turnovers, and 50/6/5 on 71/75/78 is remarkable no matter what time of year or setting. Not to mention a 40 point game seven performance on equally stellar shooting splits againt the Clippers in the next series.

They may also recall the following season prior to his injury he became the first player in NBA history to score 50 points with no free throws attempted, shooting 21-25 from the floor and 8-10 from three. That was his seventh game of that season of 30 points or more on over 50% from the field.

While those moments are incredible on their own, it's rare to see Murray mentioned with the best scorers in the league. That's understandable as last season was Murray's first season averaging over 20ppg (48/41/88 splits), he has never been an All-Star, he has never made an All-NBA team, he is his team's secondary scoring option, and the Nuggets simply aren't on TV very often enough to warrant an eye-test > box score type of situation. That's a tough argument to make even to the most ardent Nuggets fan.

Luckily for this article's sake as you dive deeper into the data on Murray, specifically the tracking data, it becomes apparent that the Nuggets are bringing back an All-Star (and if given the volume All-NBA) level scoring talent. 

That's a remarkably bold claim to make and certainly one that needs some pretty significant evidence to back it up. 

###**To start making the case for Jamal Murray, ""All-Star+ Level Scorer"", let's first take a look at his perimeter shooting.**

[The following data is from Murray's 20-21 season and provided by Bball Index.](https://www.bball-index.com/)

**Perimeter Shooting Compared To Entire League**

|Statistic|Value|Percentile|Grade|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3PT%|40.8%|90%|A|
|Pull Up 3PT%|39.1%|82%|A-|
|C&amp;S 3PT%|43.9%|91%|A|
|ATB 3PT%|39.7%|87%|A-|
|Corner 3PT%|48.8%|86%|A-|

Those percentages and associated grades indicate that Jamal Murray is an all-tools distance shooter. Other players who graded out similarly across those five statistics were guys like Kyrie Irving, Paul George, and Khris Middleton. The only players grading out higher than him in 20-21 were the likes of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and Zach LaVine. A similar case when compared to shooters this season as well. 

For me I initially question whether or not that's a byproduct of being open more than other players, as the overall offensive gravity of Jokic has to be measured on a planetary scale. Put another way, are Murray's shooting percentages so high because he's getting uniquely high quality looks compared to these other players?

The answer to that is ""kind of, but not really."" 

Murray *does* get better looks than the guys I've mentioned for the most part. Guys like Durant, Curry, and LaVine only saw an open three-point shot (defender no closer than 4ft) on around 8-10% of their attempts. That grades out as a rock bottom F, which makes sense considering defenses are primarily keying in on stopping those guys from shooting those shots. Given the types of shots that they do get up, the Shot Quality and Openness Rating (an estimation of how open a player's 3pt attempts are on average) that all of these elite 5-cat 3pt shooters are seeing, tend to be the worst percentile grades possible. 

In other words, most of the highest graded perimeter scorers are seeing the least open looks.

For example, Curry grades out out fantastically on all of his distance shooting percentages. Naturally. He also has the worst Openness Rating in the league, the worst 3pt Shot Quality in the league, and one of the worst percentages of 3PTAs open in the league as well. That of course makes it that much more impressive that his shooting percentages remain so high, and why he ends up grading out #1 among all perimeter shooters, but a bit more on those calculations later.

Murray, while grading out excellently with his shooting percentages, definitely isn't seeing the kind of coverages and defensive suction that Curry does on a nightly basis. Only 10% of Curry's 3PTAs were classified as open last year, compared to Murray who saw a wide open look 14% of the time. 

Steph's average shot distance was almost 27ft compared to Murray who's typical shot measured out just under 26ft. A longer shot is a more difficult shot, and for Curry those longer shots are a result of backing up to try and get more space from defenders. Curry also shoots 4% more C&S threes than Murray and 4% less threes from the corner. That may indicate that his shot types are more often needing to be released quicker and from a more difficult spot on the floor than are Murray's. 

While Curry is an extreme example other players like KD, LaVine, and George are closer to Curry's Quality and Openness rating than they are to Murray. Even someone like Kyrie who is 1b on offense, an all-timer at creating space, and very good at moving off the ball is about half-way in between Curry and Murray's grades.

That doesn't mean that Murray isn't capable of making those shots, but it does mean that in general he is getting better looks. A large part of that is that it greatly helps to have a great screener like Jokic who in addition to being a big body that defenders have to get around, is also a dangerous option in every conceivable way were the ball to find him instead of Murray. 

[For pull-up 3s a simple high PNR like this is something you'll see Murray run with Jokic multiple times a game.](http://tiny.cc/qyqtuz)

Landry gets caught on the screen from some Jokic hands, but also is physical with him to stop him from straight diving to the rim for an easy bucket. Allen does a good job of picking Jokic back up, but that's because he opts not to stick on Murray due in part to the danger of Jokic, leaving Landry to scramble back for a contest on Murray's pull up. 

[Here's another example of this against the Wizards.](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/02/25/0022000502/323/e94f0077-b107-065b-e41c-290105d56f28_1280x720.mp4) 

This starts with a half-hearted screen by Morris on Wagner, the beginning of an action that usually sees Jokic dive to the low block and get an entry pass. Wagner goes under the ""screen"" to prevent this, Jokic recognizes that and goes to set the screen on Beal knowing Wagner won't be in a spot to contest a three, Beal does a good job of spinning off the screen and getting a good contest on Murray who knocks it down anyway.

[Jokic will also set multiple screens or feint them in order to generate pull up opportunities for Murray.](http://tiny.cc/syqtuz) 

Here we see Jokic behind the play coming up to set a screen for Murray to drive towards the middle of the floor. MPJ swaps from the corner with Facu to come up to the wing as an option for Murray to pass out to in case Bembry helps down. Baynes, assuming Murray is going to use that screen takes a big step down into the paint to contain it. FVV fights over the screen and stuffs Murray here assuming that it's just a standard high PNR to get Murray going to the right. 

However the action the entire time, or at least a very standard option off of it, was for Jokic to feint that screen to get FVV's momentum committed to containing Murray going right, immediately flipping around and tracking where that left Fred, setting the real screen/be a big pylon the defender has to navigate, and getting Murray a pull up three in rhythm. 

However as Kia Nurse points out in that clip, that still resulted in a pretty difficult shot. [Even when moving off-ball and using a screen, he still sees defenses committing hard to contest.](http://tiny.cc/tyqtuz) 

This is where we get to that ""kind of, but not really"" half-answer I gave earlier. 

When looking at the entirety of the league and even when comparing him solely to primary ball handlers, Murray still grades out near the bottom of the league in Openness Rating (19th percentile/F), Percentage of 3PTA Open (21st percentile/D-), and 3PT Shot Quality (24th percentile/D-). So while he is getting more open shots and better looks at a higher rate than some of his All-NBA co-workers, he is still seeing very few compared to everyone but the very best perimeter scorers in the league. 

**This is properly reflected in his cumulative perimeter shooting grade.**

|Statistic|Value (Z-Score)|Percentile|Grade|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3PT Shot Making|+1.15|97%|A+|
|Shot Creation|+2.17|98%|A+|
|Perimeter Shooting|+1.37|96%|A+|

**Taking everything into consideration, Murray does grade out as one of the very best perimeter shooters and scorers in the entire NBA.** 

*3PT Shot Making* is an estimation of a player's proficiency in shooting 3-point shots given their degree of difficulty. With Murray back in the mix, Denver will be getting back one of the better shooters in the league, particularly in regards to difficult or contested shots. That means Jokic does not have to be the panic button for every single play or the only person you can rely on to get a bucket against tough coverages.

[At the end of a shot clock, the Nuggets can be comfortable with the ball in Murray's hands as he has proven to consistently make tough shots.](http://tiny.cc/uyqtuz) 

Here he is against Matisse Thybulle with the shot clock winding down, Thybulle sticks right with him on a step back, but Murray remains uneffected and drains it anyway.

[Similarly at the end of a game, the Nuggets can go to Murray just as they do Jokic.](http://tiny.cc/vyqtuz)

He is likely an even better option if they need a three like they did here against the Wizards, as he drains a 30 footer over Hachimura.

[Murray is also an excellent C&S guy who moves well without the ball and is able to find his shooting base quickly.](http://tiny.cc/wyqtuz)

Among qualified players, Murray grades out as an 89th percentile C&S 3PT Talent.

[He's very good coming off a screen like the above example, but maybe even better curling around one for a drop off/handoff pass and quick shot over the screening action.](http://tiny.cc/xyqtuz)

Murray makes 1.02 points per handoff possession which grades out in the 95th percentile.

[He is a dangerous transition option from distance as well, often flaring out for an open shot.](http://tiny.cc/zyqtuz) Additionally he [rarely rushes these attempts, and is great at finding the space he needs.](http://tiny.cc/0zqtuz)

[An even better example Murray's patience  is on this play that ends up forcing OT vs. Chicago.](http://tiny.cc/2zqtuz)

*Shot Creation* captures a player's ability to self-create their 3-point attempts, looking at the % of their 3PT shots unassisted and their unassisted volume per 100 possessions. A 98th percentile grade in self-creation in addition to the Shot Making suggests he is a tier-1 go-to scorer from distance. 

A defense has to key in on Murray as if he were the #1 scoting option once he crosses half-court. We've seen that in a lot of these associated clips but unless you're watching a lot of Nuggets games you may not be aware of just how often Murray scores on creating separation from defenders off the dribble without the use of a screen.

[By far his most used move for separation is a one dribble move where he plants his right foot before stepping back.](http://tiny.cc/4zqtuz) 

Here Oubre opens up his base to run with Jamal if he decides to drive left, allowing him to do a quick in dribble and step back three.   

[When a big switches onto Murray, he will threaten with the drive in order to create space for the stepback.](http://tiny.cc/5zqtuz) 

Portis plays deep which causes Craig to have to switch onto Jokic once Jokic spaces out. Murray gets the mismatch and instead of trying to post Jokic with 10s on the clock, crosses over for a baseline drive before stepping back for a corner three.

[If a big like Gobert has switched out on him and he doesn't threaten with a drive, he also likes to plant off his left foot to create more space into a fadeaway.](http://tiny.cc/7zqtuz)

[Murray is also reads defensive breakdowns very well.](http://tiny.cc/8zqtuz) 

Bridges stays with Jokic on the screen instead of sticking with Murray, Ayton is playing the lane and doesn't switch out to Murray who notices this and takes a dribble in that destabalizes Ayton and allows Murray to create a ton of space for a step back three. 

Someone who is able to get their own shot like Murray does is what Denver missed most last year. Outside of Jokic, the Nuggets were one of the worst teams in the league in self-created offense. The top perimeter scorers and playmakers for the Nuggets last season were Morris and Barton, both shot 60% or more of their three pointers off of C&S and shot in the low 30% on their few pull-up 3PTAs. This helped defenses to contain their drives more consistently, as they were not a significant threat to pull up above the break.

At times the Nuggets offense was effectively frozen, as Aaron Gordon and Jeff Green are not great self creation guys either. To make matters worse even when players found themselves open, there was very little consistency in the overall shot making of the team. The Nuggets generated the 6th most open looks from 3 in the league last year but finished 17th in 3pt%. 

With no self-creators outside of Jokic, the Nuggets ended up having having the lowest scoring 2nd option in the league: Gordon at 15ppg. Not OKC (Dort 17.2), not Houston (Green 17.3), not Orlando (Wagner 15.2), but the Nuggets.

Now with Murray (and MPJ) back in the mix the Nuggets have a perimeter shooting threat for every second of the shot clock, who will reliably make his open shots, makes his contested threes at a higher rate than players last year made their open looks, and more importantly is someone who can be effective without Jokic on the floor. 

In the past this allowed the Nuggets to stagger Murray and Jokic to ensure that there wouldn't be endless possessions of motionless gunk resulting in a low quality looks, turnover sprees, and shot clock violations, or as it was known for most of last year, ""bench minutes."" 

However, Murray will need to be more than a perimeter threat to help push the Nuggets back to contending status in an increasingly talented West. 


##**Jamal Murray's Finishing**

While distance shooting is the most noteworthy part of Murray's scoring, his ability to finish at the rim is reliable if not undervalued. 

|Statistic|Value|Percentile|Grade|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Adjusted FG% at Rim|71.54%|91%|A|
|Rim Shot Quality|+0.5|50%|C|
|Rim Shot Making|+1.4|92%|A|
|Finishing Talent|+0.5|85%|A-|

Murray grades out as a far above average finisher overall, overcoming a number of variables that set him back in this calculation.

While Murray is [known to have](http://tiny.cc/dzqtuz) some [wild finishes](http://tiny.cc/gzqtuz), and drives into the paint at a very solid 9 times per 75 possessions, the biggest barrier to him being graded as highly as his outside shooting is the volume of shots he takes on those drives. 

Murray only takes about 3 FGAs at the rim per 75, leaving him in the 33rd percentile for total shots at the rim. This would be a major drawback if it was leading to turnovers or he was a poor drive and kick player, but around 36% of his drives result in a passout to a teammate and his driving creation rests at a pretty average rate. 

Murray is a great athlete and can [throw one down when he wants to](http://tiny.cc/izqtuz), but at 6'3"" and without elite explosion, strength, or handles, he doesn't look for a ton opportunities at the rim. Part of that may be a conscious choice or a function of his shooting being a better option, or having Jokic as an option to pass to once he's in there, but I think he has it in him to increase his attempts going forward.

He is also not a contact seeking player. In 20-21 he only drew contact on about 6% of his attempts in the paint and when fouled only converted about 16% of those to an and-one. That conversion rate is only in the 28th percentile. He seems to prefer being a [contortionist](http://tiny.cc/mzqtuz) who finds a way to avoid the defender and make the shot. That's where we can start understanding how he grades so highly despite the potential drawbacks.    

He starts to build his case for being a high quality finisher via conversion rate. He makes an exceptional amount of his attempts at the rim: 71.54% when adjusted for the volume. Additionally his Rim Shot Quality grade shows that he's not getting the amount of quality looks that would result such a high percentage. 

[Murray has good touch over taller defenders when he gets in the paint.](http://tiny.cc/nzqtuz) 

Here he finds the high angle off glass over Randle with the left hand instead of opting for a righty floater.

[Here we can see a Murray drive on Gobert.](http://tiny.cc/qzqtuz) 

Conley is flat footed after avoiding the screen which allows Murray to drive into the paint, noticing Gobert loading up to contest the shot on the right side of the glass, Murray opts to go under and use the rim to block Gobert off resulting in a nice reverse finish.

While highlight finishes and heavily contested dunks may not be an every night occurance, he is regularly converting in fairly tough situations. This results in an excellent grade for Rim Shot Making, which is a player's ability to finish, adjusted for degree of difficulty and where the shot is taken from. 

Most of his made buckets at the basket are also unassisted, just a shade under 68% of them, which grades out in the 76th percentile; a positive grade and another indicator that the Nuggets are getting back an offensive weapon who can slice up a defense on his own, instead of having to sharpen himself against Jokic every night. 

[Murray has displayed excellent patience and awareness of the defense as a driver.](http://tiny.cc/szqtuz) 

Monte gets stuck after picking up his dribble and Murray comes to get the ball. Jokic shows the dive but backs out to screen for Murray. Wannamaker avoids the screen and extends himself over Jokic, allowing Murray to cross over and get Brad on his hip after an in-and-out dribble. From there he sticks Brad behind him and gets a wide open lay up.

[Even when he picks up his dribble he can rely on his footwork to create opportunities against similar sized defenders.](http://tiny.cc/tzqtuz) 

Murray drives baseline and looks for the step back jumper. Conley does a soft contest on the pump fake it and that allows Murray to step through for an easy two. 

[Murray also has good ball skills and change of direction that allow him to seek switches and freeze larger defenders.](http://tiny.cc/yzqtuz) 

Against Anthony Davis, Murray works a series of crossovers and step back moves to push Davis to the hoop until he's able to sneak past him for the easy floater.

Though he mostly gets to the rim on his own accord, I believe that he's even better when he's looking to cut. I could make a 10 minute compilation of Murray's cutting ability and knack for feeling a defender ease up just a little, but if you've ever watch a Jokic Best Passes video you'll have seen a lot of that. It's hard to know which of those is the more impactful part of those plays, so I don't want to dive too deep on that. 

All of this culminates in his Finishing Talent grading out in the 85th percentile. That's calculated as a function of how well a player gets to the rim in addition to how well a player finishes at the rim, encompassing his ability with the ball in hand, his off ball movement to get opportunities at the rim, and the conversion rate once he's there in addition to how difficult those looks are. 

While not elite that's very good for a guy who is known primarily as a shooter. Despite a lower volume of attempts at the rim compared to many of his positional peers, thanks to his excellent Rim Shot Making which grades out higher than guys like Beal and Durant, his Finishing Talent ends up slightly higher than players like Booker, Butler, Lillard, and Steph Curry.  

Whether or not those grades are gospel, he is clearly capable of getting things going towards the rim and cannot be played too far up on by his defender.

##**So he's an elite perimeter shooter and a high level finisher, what about the in-between game?**

While there is less data for the mid-range and I bring you no fancy tables, Murray has his spots that he has hit at a great clip for the past two seasons and has become an effective three-level scorer. While it's not at the level of his distance shooting or finishing, it is still steadily improving. He's aware of his limitations and doesn't settle for an abundance of middies, rather he looks to find his best zones and get out if they aren't there. 

The last two seasons he hits left side elbow jumpers at around a 50% clip on 200 attempts, good for 90th percentile in that zone and enough to warrant the ""high volume"" designation, as well as the inside of the right wing and the left baseline. 

[A lot of his mid-range attempts tend to be end of clock situations in the PNR with Jokic.](https://on.nba.com/3aW236T) 

Houston is playing at the level of the screen and starching any good look from distance. Murray again uses the plant foot to get some space for a step back fadeaway over Brown. Tough shot.

Additionally in the 20-21 season among high volume mid-range players (> 4 FGA) he was 8th in FG% on non-restricted area shots at a similar rate as Khris Middleton.

[So shots like this, where Murray will get into the paint and plant off a log for little turnaround](https://on.nba.com/3IWUeKx), or a little [floater-jumper](https://on.nba.com/3IWUeKx). He's also an effective post player at his position, grading out in the 83rd percentile for Post Up PPP. 

While he is certainly not a mid-range killer like Durant or DeRozan, he is an effective threat who plays with a great deal of control for a player his age and doesn't overshoot his welcome. He tends to only work the midrange when it can be set up by running off [Jokic screens for handoffs](https://on.nba.com/3S3ZBMm) or via the PNR. That leads us into the last major part of Murray's offense.

##**Murray's Playmaking**

What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about the Nuggets offense? Jokic of course, but more specifically Jokic's passing. That's what I think of at least. It's a system built around this Serbian supercomputer who makes every decision for the offense, finds cutters and shooters from impossible angles, passes guys open when they would otherwise not be, who just lead the league in touches and passes by a mile, and is so fundamental to the ability for a scoring opportunity to be created for his team that last year in the minutes he was off the floor the Nuggets played like an 18-win team, good for dead last in the league.  

That historically bad scoring in non-Jokic minutes for Denver was due in large part to a lack of playmaking. Morris, while a good traditional point guard is not a great plate setter, or a dangerous scoring option that can use that to open up his passing. Barton is a notoriously sloppy passer, Hyland has talent and a good eye but was a rookie, and Facu while being one of the best passers on the entire planet is so unthreatening as a scorer that teams can simply play the pass with him 100% of the time. 

That brings us to the return of Murray, who is a little bit of everything that those guys are not. 

While he's not CP3, or Trae, or Doncic, he might be a much better passer and playmaker than he is perceived to be. That's huge for a Nuggets team that desperately needs to find a way to lighten the load for Jokic both physically and mentally. The Nuggets will not get away from Jokic-ball, and he will certainly still be the main distributor and decision maker, but Murray coming back means that much like his scoring, the Nuggets will once again have guy to lean on and offload playmaking responsibility to.   

**Let's dive back into some data and look at playmaking grades.**.

|**Statistic**|**Value**|**Percentile**|**Grade**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Ast Pts/75|12.24|81%|A-|
|Role Adj Ast Pts/75|-2.45|30%|D|
|Pot. Ast/100 Passes|20.03|84%|A-|
|Passing Creation Volume|+1.04|84%|A-|
|Passing Efficiency|0.73|82%|A-|
|Passing Versatility|1.37|93%|A|
|High Val Ast/75|4.23|81%|A-|
|Passing Creation Quality|+0.50|69%|B|
|[Box Creation](https://t.co/UiqyQjxrEu?amp=1)|7.4|93%|A|
|Scoring Gravity|+2.14|96%|A+|
|Playmaking Talent|0.95|89%|A-|

I imagine that many of you are as surprised as I am at how well Murray grades out as a playmaker. This is peppered with more A's than Oakland as he rests comfortable between 80th and 90th percentile on most things. Then there's that D plastered up at the top there for RA Ast Pts/75. That D on its could signify that Murray is a bad passer for his role, which leads me to needing to preface the above data. 

This is graded against all other players in the league as opposed to only guards or primary ball handlers. Once it's filtered down to just other point guards, everything except for Role Adj Ast Pts, Passing Versatility, and Scoring Gravity go down considerably for Murray. I chose to grade this out against all other players because for the Nuggets, Murray does not function as their point guard the way that PGs on any other team do bur rather a secondary playmaker. That D grade is a result of the role adjustment that compares him to guys like CP3 and Trae. 

Since Jokic is the Nuggets analog to those guys, as in he's their primary distributor when he is on the floor, Murray functions more as a combo guard and thus does not see a high volume of situations as a distributor. A similar situation to Brunson in Dallas and in this upcoming season for Dejounte Murray in Atlanta. 

With that being said when compared to the rest of the league, Murray grades out extremely favorably as a playmaker. When he does pass the ball it tends to result in good scoring opportunities for his team, as illustrated by Pot. Assists per 100 Passes. Passing Creation Volume suggests the same thing but is calculated a bit differently. 

Passing Efficiency ""looks at High Value Assists and Bad Pass TO numbers along with Ball Control % to gauge which players are more efficient with their possessions and time to create scoring opportunities for teammates."" That shows that when Murray has the ball in his hands he's not ball stopping, he's not turning it over, and when it leaves his hands as a pass it results in good looks. 

Passing Versatility ""looks at Synergy passing data on assists from scoring Play Types and SportRadar data on assist locations to gauge who is passing from what types of looks to reward more well rounded passers."" This is an excellent grade for Murray and highlights that he's capable of converting on many different types of passes all over the floor, and not just dump offs to Jokic or swing passes around the perimeter.  

**Let's look at some of that versatility**.

[Here Murray misses a shot and relocates for the rebounder to find him on the perimeter.](https://on.nba.com/3v3G44v) Instead of forcing up a contested shot, Murray pump fakes to Morris who is open to his left causing Williams to go for the steal, and rockets a pass across the court to an open corner three.

[Harris cuts down the middle thanks to some lousy Houston D](https://on.nba.com/3RS2AHo) after passing to Murray. Murray walks into a one handed 30ft lob to Harris that lands across the hoop. And 1.

[Here's another Gary and 1](https://on.nba.com/3olVVYB) this time showing off Murray's passing in transition as he lobs it overhead down the court and falls out of bounds.

[This time Murray finds himself in a bit of a jam after stumbling at the top of the key](https://on.nba.com/3Bqb5E7), he keeps control of the ball and recovers for a nice bounce pass to a cutting Green.

[Nuggets run a set where the bigs set a double screen as Murray comes across.](https://on.nba.com/3OtasMy) Hartenstein sets a pick on Murray's initial defender who picks up Green once Murray clears the screens. Murray lobs a one handed hook pass over the defense to an open Green for three.

[While the pass isn't impressive](https://on.nba.com/3RWSIw3) Murray shows good court awareness here as he motions for MPJ to clear out and drag the fronting CP3 away, giving Jokic an easy mismatch and make. 

[Murray is operating out of the high post with Schroder playing way up on him.](https://on.nba.com/3J4CCg4) With his back to the basket Murray catches a cutting MPJ in the paint with a nice across the body bullet.

[Here Murray finds MPJ cutting again](https://on.nba.com/3OsnVEH) this time off the dribble, faking the jump shot, and connecting mid-air.

His most common passes are to Jokic in the PNR, so a big part of getting Jamal back is being able to run that and force defenses to have to decide how to guard two potent scorers who are perfectly in-tune with each other. 

##**Jokic and Murray: ""Perfectly in-tune?""** 

In the 18-19 season Jokic had 147 assists solely to Murray, the 11th most assists between two players. 17th place was Murray's 123 assists to Jokic, a combined 270 good for first among all NBA duos. The next season season Jokic had 129 assists to Murray, the 3rd most between two players, while Murray's 116 to Jokic were good for 9th place. A combined 245 and good for 1st among all duos once again. In the 20-21 season before injury, the duo were on pace to do it again. 

While Jokic is the premier playmaking talent in the league, grading out no lower than 97th percentile in any relevant playmaking statistic and a 100th percentile overall, that supercomputer becomes a quantum computer when you hook Murray up to it. While on his own Murray is not one of the league's best facilitators, the chemistry between the two has allowed him to be an elite passer when getting the ball to Jokic. 

Jokic's offense and the Murray/Jokic PNR has been dissected enough by major outlets so I won't overdo it. If you want to know more about it I'd suggest watching [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuO1iGP5L7I) two [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuO1iGP5L7I) about him. It's remarkably great. Those two know how to get the ball to each other under any circumstance and both take advantage of how the other player bends a defense. 

I do want to point out as it is Murray-relevant and not talked about as too much, that Jamal is a fantastic screener for his position. He grades out in the 98th percentile as a Screening Talent, and in the 81st percentile on Roll Impact which is points scored above/below what league average efficiency would yield. He is not just elite as the ball handler, but as the roller for when Jokic is the handler as well. Pick your poison.

Murray's 93rd percentile in Box Creation and 96th percentile in Scoring Gravity both suggest that his presence as a scoring threat is potent enough to open the floor for his playmaking and for his teammates to get open thanks to the defensive attention on him. It grades at a similar level as Booker and Kyrie. That is 1st option level gravity in play, while the defense is already busy dealing with Jokic who essentially doubles both of Murray's values in those respective stats. 

Consider for a moment that Jokic was flashing 100th percentile in all of these playmaking and scoring stats last year without his second and third leading scorers. What does Murray's return, a player who far outshines any scorer or playmaker the Nuggets had last year, mean for Jokic? Logic dictates that with Murray on the floor Jokic will see a higher amount of easier shots, which means that after becoming one of four players (Jokic, Curry, Barkley, Dantley) to average 27ppg on 66% TS or higher last year, he could put up even more impressive numbers. At the very least from an efficiency standpoint. That's a terrifying thought for the rest of the league.

Jokic's gaudy numbers aside, the Nuggets will be overjoyed for what this means for their 4th quarter and crunch time offense that struggled to replicate the 4th quarter and closing-time success that they had found in previous years. Denver can expect a return to form with Murray back, as the Jokic-Murray two man game was the bread and butter of their late game offense and resulted in them being two of the top five clutch performers in the league.

**Jokic and Murray were both top five clutch scorers in 20-21?**

Incredibly, yes. That year Jokic was 2nd in the league in FGM on average in the clutch, defined as ""when the scoring margin is within 5 points with five or fewer minutes remaining in a game."" He had 1.5 FGM on 49.5 shooting. Murray was 4th in the league with 1.4 FGM on 50.9% shooting, including a blistering 57% from distance and a perfect 100% from the line. The only player to not miss a FT in the clutch. 

##**Summation Of Murray's Offense**

As a perimeter shooter, he grades out as one of the very best in the league. He is in an All-NBA tier as a 3PT shot maker when grading for difficulty of the shots attempted. He is one of the best 3PT shot creators in the league, 98th percentile among all players, and gives the Nuggets a tier-1 scorer from distance with the ball in his hands, coming off a screen, or spotting up where he is in the 99th percentile among all players at a blistering 1.26 points per possession.

As a finisher he approaches All-Star caliber shot making as he grades out in the 92nd percentile and the 91st percentile in adjusted FG% at the rim. While he won't take as many shots at the rim as a number of other elite scorers, he is excellent in the attempts he takes, and is one of the better tough shot makers in the league at the rim. He grades out in the 90th percentile across all positions for floaters and in the 91st percentile for One on One Talent.

In the mid-range Murray is is a capable scorer who does not settle for difficult shots. He is good at finding the zones where he is most comfortable and getting the space needed for a shot, especially off of screens or the PNR. He is a serious threat in the non-restricted paint area, and has a solid post game and great footwork for his position. He also grades out in the 89th percentile as passer in the post.

Speaking of passing, he may be one of the more underrated playmakers in the NBA. Thanks to his elite 96th percentile Scoring Gravity and 93rd percentile Box Creation, he grades out as an excellent playmaking talent who reliably makes a variety of high-value passes from all over the court. He is a luxury for the Nuggets as a secondary PG/facilitator and will be able to take the every-possession burden off of Jokic's shoulders and help get guys involved. 

In addition to all of this, Murray's return is also spells of one of the most effective two-man games in the league. The Murray-Jokic PNR is a nightmare for defenses to deal with and perhaps the most consistent late-game bucket generator in the league. Murray grades out in the 97th percentile as a PNR Ball Handler, and in the 20-21 season before going down joined Jokic as one of the four best clutch scorers in the league. 

When considering how well those two play with each other in addition to everything else, his impact on the Nuggets offense cannot be overstated. 

**The defensive section will be attached as a comment below this post since this already hit the self-post character limit. I will keep it shorter for the sake of everyone's attention span!**"

Tower of Sisyphus complete guide- how to place high on the Leaderboard,Returnal,ud39ag,2022-04-27 09:12:09,74,0.98,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Returnal/comments/ud39ag/tower_of_sisyphus_complete_guide_how_to_place/,LyubakaR,Gameplay,"Hello again fellow Returnal enthusiasts,

This post is to explain the Tower of Sisyphus as a whole, as well as how to **manipulate** the game for your benefit in order to get those numbers cranking up.

**I. Backstory**

I started doing tower runs after beating the game for the 20th+ time and after some fresh file speedrunning attempts. At first I did legit runs(hardcore mode w/o any manipulation) and was enjoying it quite a lot. However as I started climbing the leaderboard, the task became tedious and quite frankly not so enjoyable.

Anyway in my runs I noticed that I did not get a single shotgun(**Spitmaw Blaster**) and I thought to myself that they probably removed it from the tower loot pool as they have with some artefacts as it is not useful at all. Later I watched a video of a guy using **Coilspine Shredder** and I realized that I have never **unlocked that weapon in this save file** either. Then it hit me, that since this was a fresh file used for a speedrun I never **unlocked/scanned** either of the above mentioned weapons, hence I was not getting them as drops. Which begged the question, what will happen if I only unlock **Dreadbound**( as some of you might know, that\`s the God Tier weapon for the Tower of Sisyphus)....

As I am not experienced enough with streaming, uploading, twitch etc. Here is the only evidence that I have for the highscore without any manipulations( legit run with all weapons etc. relying on RNG to get a Dreadbound with perfect traits): [https://imgur.com/b1Krq1Q](https://imgur.com/b1Krq1Q)

Pretty neat considering the run was not manipulated in any way I managed to crack top100 on the leaderboard.

However the way I died in this run was beyond ridiculous: Fell out of the map--> It spawns me automatically from where I fell--> A broken automaton explodes in my face pushing me again(preventing me from using any items in the process) out of the map with 1hp which resulted the death.

This left me with a bitter taste, since the run was far from over with 30+ shield vials and 15+ Large Medkits. This bitter taste did not let me have my peace with the game and pushed me in doing something that I will later regret... (will explain later why)

**II. Manipulating/ Fixing the save file**

That\`s right I deleted my save file once more and was determined to play this game on my terms this time and not rely on RNG.

I started streaming AND this time recording my stream afterwards on my twitch([twitch.tv/Yetkata](https://twitch.tv/Yetkata)). Before I was only streaming for my friends on twitch but 1 guy constantly watched me and told me that the Thermogenic Launcher was a beast weapon with the Full Auto trait. I said fk it  I will give it a try and he was actually right- here is a video of me melting Algos 3-20 with the Thermogenic launcher, before deciding to delete the save file and start from scratch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_YpscjdJx\_c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YpscjdJx_c)

The process of getting the ideal save file for the Tower of Sisyphus includes a 2 steps which I will break down below:

**2.1 Beating the game** unlocking/scanning the weapons that **YOU want/need** for the tower that would be Dreadbound and/or Thermogenic launcher. I still think that Dreadbound is the single best weapon for the Tower and you only need IT, but I still unlocked the Thermogenic launcher on my file, because why not, it\`s enjoyable(for me atleast) + I was willing to play with both of them which gave me not a 50/50 for the chests (Pistol/Dreadbound) but a 66/33 for the 3 weapons in total unlocked.Basically this step involves running trough the game and **SCANNING only the Dreadbound in BIOME 5 Golden room whilst getting as many artefacts and Datacubes along the way** because you will need them unlocked + making it easier for you since you are playing pistol only all the way until Biome 5. In short not a speedrun, not a full run but something in between, it took me just under 3 hours to do that( breaks and goofing around included):[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1462553429?fbclid=IwAR0aFpQqAoVA1b-gnVCFe3nzmFX7NiSNu463T-erE57KEwEDHPeX4Hi-nn0](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1462553429?fbclid=IwAR0aFpQqAoVA1b-gnVCFe3nzmFX7NiSNu463T-erE57KEwEDHPeX4Hi-nn0)

**2.2 Artefacts and Trait farm**

As I already mentioned you will need the artefacts unlocked for the Tower runs. Since I did not want to waste time on collecting all the data cubes which were out of my way I figured I will create my own way of finding the items and it was **Cthonos** the Monolith which you can see in every new run before entering the first room of the cycle. For this Method however you will need  **ALOT of Ether**, so I devised the following plan for farming Ether aswell as Traits for the weapons:

Begin a new cycle in Biome 4(basically after you beat the game ACT III) run trough rooms collecting every Ether on the ground up until the boss room--> Go into boss room--> Go to Biome 6, get the Calibrator that you are offered at the start that brings you all the way to Prof lvl. 24 open the chest top right in the same room---> Find one of those big ass shielded bitches that spawns the little Octopuses and beat the living shit out of them until you get the traits that you need( I will explain later which ones) all the way to lvl 3---> Go and kill **Ophion for an easy 5 Ether**\--> Rinse and Repeat.PS. You end up with about 20 Ether per run, of course RNG dependent + Ophion kill

I do not have Video material of this farm as I thought it was not gonna be interesting, all I have is this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjTXh\_C9xGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjTXh_C9xGs) in which Ophion has a little stroke, but basically this is one of the many farming runs described above.

The results:

Time: \~10hours depending on RNG again and if you get both the **Thermogenic and the Dreadbound.**

Thermogenic launcher: [https://imgur.com/a/aA5o87Z](https://imgur.com/a/aA5o87Z)Dreadbound: [https://imgur.com/a/UIpnPKU](https://imgur.com/a/UIpnPKU)Bonus: [https://imgur.com/a/ffyvgrX](https://imgur.com/a/ffyvgrX)

Artefacts: No screenshots needed. Got all except: AST-AA-002; AST-AA-008; AST-AA-015; AST-AA-024. Which are not present in the Tower and/or are completely irrelevant. If someone is wondering what are those Letters and numbers, that\`s when you go to your Databank in-game and go to Artefacts, also here are all the available artefacts:[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/292804-returnal/faqs/79310/artifacts?fbclid=IwAR01nXyrWDDw81u2zA0pOAHHBo5I8KHb2sbKbzIC7He\_lLdVIQ8w22nnqao](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/292804-returnal/faqs/79310/artifacts?fbclid=IwAR01nXyrWDDw81u2zA0pOAHHBo5I8KHb2sbKbzIC7He_lLdVIQ8w22nnqao) You can compare the ones you have with the list as you are preparing.

**III. Tips and tricks for the most optimal Tower Run**

I will divide everything in a few categories items/weapons/artefacts and playstyle , starting with:

**3.1 Weapons and Weapon traits**

Every weapon is part of a group for that weapon( see the screenshots above or in your Databank tab under Equipment), which essentially means that you cannot have 2 traits from the same group, that\`s why it\`s crucial to know what to lvl up while preparing as well as what are you looking for when you search for a weapon.

**Thermogenic Launcher Best in slot traits:**

Critical rockets III

Replicating Hits III

Full Auto ( honestly even Full auto I works, I personally found absolutely no difference between Full auto I and III)

Thermite Rockets III

**Note\*** Do not even bother picking up a Thermogenic w/o Full Auto.

**Dreadbound best in slot traits:**

Fourth Shard III

**Expanding Shards III**

**Explosive Shards III**

Damage Steal III

**Note\*** From my experience Expanding Shards and Explosive Shards are a **MUST,** of course **Fourth Shard** in nice to have and boosts the damage output but it is such an ELUSIVE combination to get all 3 that I even stopped bothering and ran without it, as you will see in my run below. As long as you have Expanding shards and Explosive shards at lvl III you are good to go, ignore the other 2 traits, and respectively don\`t swap them out for an e.g Fourth Shard II.

**3.2 Artefacts** I will only bother mentioning the artefacts that are a MUST, because the rest do not matter at all in later stages.

1.Blown Nightlight- 10% dmg when at full or low integrity

2.Recharging Overload- successful overloads reduce Alt fire

3.Wound seekers- 30% dmg to low health targets

4.Unfed Pod- 20% stagger power for each parasite   Note\* can be ignored if you have Staggering III

5.Energy Manipulator- 20% protection after using a consumable

6.Fractal Nail- +10% dmg while having a malfunction

7.Phantom Limb- 10% chance to heal after kill

8.Golden Coil- +5% weapon dmg for every 200 Obolites( max 15%)

9.Murmuring Cocoon- better parasites

10.Resin Enhancer- 2 resins for max integrity

11.Progenitor Egg- attaching/detaching parasites--> heal

**12.Resinous shield- shield after resin pickup**

13. Reactive Stabilisers- 95% reduced chance for a knockdown

14. Energy Manipulator- 20% protection after using a consumable(handy)

There are other suit artefacts which are quite useful **IF** you are **NOT** using the Dreadbound but completely useless with it, that\`s why I haven\`t included them.

Again as reference, all artefacts: [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/292804-returnal/faqs/79310/artifacts?fbclid=IwAR2GtBEVVYcj\_t3DecnPHdxnD7OvdOiggLbQzYL0R2TTBXIPm\_NGDucFyNM](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/292804-returnal/faqs/79310/artifacts?fbclid=IwAR2GtBEVVYcj_t3DecnPHdxnD7OvdOiggLbQzYL0R2TTBXIPm_NGDucFyNM)

**3.3 Items**

Remember where I explained about manipulating the loot pool for weapons? Well now I will tell you that **the same goes for Items/Consumables**. As you can see here in SawJawRaptor\`s video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BUlolOHviQ&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BUlolOHviQ&t=1s) This madman has not even unlocked/discovered the little shrines which provide you with a shield vial in the Tower of Sisyphus as well as the Disgorgers. Basically ensuring that all the drops he get\`s from opening chests are Large Medkits and Shield vials, as you can tell by the numbers he has stacked in the inventory and the gameplay itself.

One user asked in the comment section if it is really worth not unlocking the Disgorger, and i dared opposing the mighty SawJaw himself by saying it is not worth... little did I know the man was ligh years ahead of me and **IT IS WORTH IT**. As you will understand from my run.

**Stack as many shield vials and large medkits as possible, this is crucial.**

&#x200B;

**3.4 Playstyle**

**-Your melee attack is your best friend**, I cannot stress enough on this. You will see me using almost only my melee attack in eraly stages combined with a jump which registers the kill as a **Mid-Air Melee** (Mid Air Melee+Weakspot kill for the turrets) which is the single most rewarding type of kill. On x100 Multiplier you get 250k points for mid-air Melee and 275k for turrets, **let that sink in**.You will see me getting hit almost everytime while doing these kills even in earlier stages- but IT IS WORTH IT.

Go for the Mid-Air Melle Kill EVERY single time. It works best on Turrets, Goombas from Biome 1, Flying octopus goombas, Bats, flying squares from BIOME 2(although they stay quite far up and rarely go down) and the Robots again from BIOME 4 **I REPEAT from BIOME 4**, save yourself some headaches and avoid meleeing the ones from BIOME 3, they do way too much dmg and it\`s not worth the risk.

\- **Weak points DO MATTER-** You will notice in the later stages that if you don\`t hit the weak points of bigger enemies for e.g Trees, The Armored pieces of fk from Biome 2, the big ass octopus/flying thing from Biome 4 where it flops on it\`s belly mid-air and exposes a weak point on it\`s back etc.\*Note when using Dreadbound with Expanding shards II or III you ahve to aim alot higher than normal for the last mob described.

**-Parasites** this is straight forward, parasites that impair your **dash,melee, picking up items, siliphium resources** are a **No-GO.** Everything else is managable.

\-**Bonus timed event rooms**

Each and every one of those rooms can be cheesed. The one with the 2 raising ""boxes"" with Proficiency on the right and Siliphium on the left is the easiest to cheese. Just rush one side entering as soon as possible collect everything and rush to the other side- quite easy.  


The 3 raising platforms with Siliphium/Proficiency/Obolites(left to right)- you can collect everything on all 3 initial platforms and then go back to the one that you desired.

The one with 3 paths is by far the hardest one to cheese and it depends on RNG again. For Example easiest way is to have obolites in one corridor and Silphium in the other, you basically rush for the obolites immediately turning back and entering the Silphium corridor with a jump over the barricade which is not yet fully extended.

**Big ass Purple(malformed) flying octopus**

Maybe it is just me, but this is a really annoying enemy to face as before I almost ALWAYS get hit with his first attack where he shoots purple homing missiles at you and they are fast as fk. In order to completely avoid that and kick his ass w/o getting hit- **dash not the side but FORWARD(into them)**.

\-**Algos Malfunctions** These are the real run killers. Basically if you get **Hostiles counter on hit**, just reset the run. This is extremely frustrating especially while you are using only Dreadbound. Others that are quite manageable include:-Hostiles leave a pool of acid after death still annoying but not a deal breaker-Hostiles heal on hit- irrelevant-Hostiles explode on death- irrelevant, even my run was with it.-Every other Dmg debuff/Obolites disappear faster/Fabricators costs increase- irrelevant

Now for the best one: **Increase Melee cooldown by 2 seconds-** not a run killer by any means, just quite annoying and you must adapt to the timing, you will see me jumping in the face of enemies and doing nothing because the melee is on CD, but apart from that it\`s manageable.

&#x200B;

**-Permanent malfunctions after the 5th one**

As you may already know you can have a maximum of 5 Permanent malfunctions, after which Algos starts destroying your equipment( Artefacts,Resins,Keys), so in later stages it is good to **stack up on Atropian Keys**

Summary:Prepare a fresh save file with **ONLY Dreadbound** unlocked/scanned(Yes, thermogenic is fun but hurts you in the long run). Farm up the needed artefacts and the weapon traits. **DO NOT** unlock the **green shrines in the tower** **AND the Disgorger**( you can see which items were left unused until the end of my run, considering I threw away like 10 while rearranging my item slots after an Algos fight) it is handy but it is **NOT WORTH IT**. Go in for the mid-air Melee kill **EVERYTIME** even if you risk getting hit, avoid straight up bad Parasites. Stack up on Keys. Keep your multiplier up at all times. Have fun and good luck!

Here is my run: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0UrS8Sswbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0UrS8Sswbo)

Sadly it is the whole stream(I picked the option to divide it into 15 minute clips when exporting to Youtube but it was not done), as you can see it took me around 3 hours without the breaks and fooling around.

You can see the final score as well as the Leaderboard placement in the end of the video, here are some timestamps that were useful:

**00:34:20-01:00:00 Thermogenic launcher gameplay**

**00:41:20- Algos 3 with Thermogenic Launcher**

**00:47:20- Thermogenic against those annoying Shell guys I\`ve been mentioning**

**03:02:00-Until the end - Shields run out**

I hope I have cleared all the questions surrounding the Tower of Sisyphus, Manipulated save files and stuff that you guys find odd. Neither SawJawRaptor nor anyone else in the Leaderboard was **Hacking/Glitching**. Ask, before you say something like that.

&#x200B;

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** I am left with the impression that most of the commenters, completely ignore the **SKILL** involved in the whole process, even preparing the file not to mention the Tower runs. Do not think that when you have the perfect save all is done and the highscore is guaranteed- the tower requires **mad skills** especially in later stages, so please have respect to others!

I regret doing this, as I grew tired of the game. All the farming, the pushing, the resets and everything make me wanna vomit just by thinking about it. I am happy with my score as I used everything that was at my disposal to achieve it(unlike the failed 80mil run) and I can finally leave the Returnal scene at peace.

P.S  Does anyone know who **ebigon** is? The number 1 player on the Leaderboard, he recently topped his WR with 90mil points. I would love to have a chat with him :)

I remain available to all of the questions that may arise, and would be happy to help!"
PVP from the eyes of a 500 series point Crystal Ranked Player on Aether,ffxiv,u42tng,2022-04-15 03:43:47,95,0.68,184,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/u42tng/pvp_from_the_eyes_of_a_500_series_point_crystal/,Kingflares,[Discussion],"First off, I hit crystal yesterday and I checked Reddit for the first time as I have had so much fun pvping, they made pvp very engaging and fun as well as competitive compared to before. Its something to do in between savages and ultimates for the hardcore players and half of my static is Diamond + atm. 

Proof - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908762376092942346/964430353353801738/unknown.png

The website that tracks ranking will update in 11 hours so you can check my position there later. but yesterday I was #55, but I assume top 100 if not 50 by now. 

However, I've seen so many misinformation and bad takes that I felt compelled to make this post.

First off, most of the memes and discussions on Reddit PvP is outright wrong as are 100% of the guides currently posted IMO, anyone who is good isn't making these guides and post and are just grinding the pvp and they have no incentive to make a good guide, why help the competition. This includes me to an extent, but I'm bored. A good example that the current upvoted guides on how healers work, the blm post, and the mch posts are all by people who are stuck in silver after 100 matches. Don't use any of them. Healers actually heal if they know how to play, healers are actually one of the strongest roles atm.

PvP varies from rank to rank depending on your elo/rank bracket. How it works is similar to LoL or Apex in a sense. If you are Silver, you get matched with mostly Bronze and Silver with the occasional gold. The hardest rank to get out of is probably Gold/Diamond as in Gold you get matched with Silver and plats. However, if you streak, there is a mechanism in the game to try to end your streak if you notice. You will get placed into higher brackets or have to carry a lower ranked player. So far from what I've gathered with friends, a streak of 3-5 means you will get placed with people 1 rank higher than your current max bracket, which as a Gold player means you'll have Diamond players. If you streak 5+, it is 2 ranks above you max. So if you are streaking SUPER hard, as a Gold player you have to fight Crystal players in an attempt to end your streak. Likewise, if you are in a series of losses, at rank 5 or 4 of your current rank, it will lower your floor to try to get you a win in ranked. So if you int 4-5 games you will get easier matches. 

That said, it can be abused. which is common in Diamond, you will see some Diamond 5 players or Crystal inting to get easier matches as they have nothing to lose until they win. 

Some other tidbits before I delve into class balancing. Maps rotate every 1 and half hours or 2 hours, so if you hate a map or have one that is good for your class, plan around that. If you are a smn, you want the fire map due to your donut aoe. 

Class Tier List from my perspective:

SSS - WHM - This is primarily a WHM rant, they are the most frustrating class in Plat-Crystal, a WHM can carry the game by themselves most of the time. In lower elo a whm is weaker as your teammates aren't good enough to justify it over a carry like Sam/nin/drg. However, once you hit the ranks where ppl know what they are doing, WHM is oppressive. Games are won and lost based on WHM difference. I would say 60%+ of my games has a whm on one or both teams. They have an unpurifiable CC in the form of polymorph and can really mess up your team at times. this is uncounterable and they have 3k more hp than sage and are harder to burst down. Every class has a counter, whether sam with watching the 30 sec cd or nin with mit. Except WHM, you can't purify their CC and they offer 50% more healing than any other healer.

S Tier 

Nin- Ninja is pretty good and balanced, in the hands of a good player it can do wonders. Shoutout to Charlotte Noire of Faerie Server, who is probably the best Ninja I've seen and is also Crystal. Ninja is good at all ranks and really shines with their ult, maneuverability and burst. Paired with a good Sam/Drg there is no limit to what you can do with this class. 

Samurai - Good at all ranks, stomps low elo like no tmmr due to players not knowing how to avoid the LB. I can see that samurai will probably be a lot worse in the coming weeks as someone will inevitably make an anti samurai addon that tracks the 30 sec cd and their ult bar and scream at you to avoid hitting them as most of their power right now is people not knowing to look out for that, which is a shame, I dislike addons, but I can see this being the first one that is made. But right now its pretty good. Monkasteer Pioneer of Gilgamesh is probably the best Sam I've seen. 

Dragoon - One of the classes that can be played at all ranks, good damage, and invuln during LB, what is there not to like? Its relatively straightforward and can burst down a player 100-0 just like sam or ninja, I foresee this class getting better once addons become prevalent as Samurai loses it's strength.

SMN - probably the caster class I've seen the most as its relatively safe damage, and the Donut Aoe synergizes well with Warrior/WHM/PLD as you can stun people in it for them. This class is particularly strong on the Fire map as you can place the donut AOE in a way that forces the enemy to stand in them due to the way the map is structured.

A Tier

Bard - Bard would be S tier if you count only Diamond + ranks, but the whole concept behind bard is to support your team, which makes bard not as good in low elo as your teammates aren't worth supporting vs you playing a damage class to carry yourself out of the lower ranks before switching to bard. A good bard in crystal and diamond knows when to buff the team and charge up our lbs as well as reposition constantly. I've seen 2 really good bard mains in Crystal and Diamond and can attest that if you have a decent team you can do wonders.

Warrior - The class I spammed the most due to wanting to lvl it, good cc, good heals, and lots of utility. I can't do as much as I could in lower elo now in Crystal, but I would place it S tier normally, but I don't know how it'll play out once people get better.

PLD - Suffers the same problem as Bard, It's a really good tank in higher ranks due to having players you can protect and is worth protecting, it does the least damage out of the 4 tanks, but offers a shit ton of utility. It is completely worthless in lower elo as no one player on your team is worth protecting. In high elo you will get accustomed the players you are playing with as there are like 40 people I constantly match with and you know who is good to protect (probably the whm or Monkasteer)

Sage/Ast/Sch- All good picks, but not as game changing as Whm and has less HP and survivability. One of my mates went sage Bronze - Plat in less than 40 matches, but swapped to whm as it was quote ""better in every way"" and he was sick of dying as Sage due to having a lower hp pool and less oh shit heals as people started focusing him down in plat. He is currently close to Crystal as WHM. Sch I've seen the least out of the 4 healers, so can't form an opinion.

MCH - Pretty strong overall. I know a bunch of pvpers who meme its TECHNICALLY the best pvp class in the game if you always roll instakills on chainsaw. You see it more often in Silver- Gold, there are a few in Diamond and Crystal, but they are all cowards and prioritized guaranteed damage and stun by buffing air anchor instead of chainsaw. But yea, if you are playing MCH, you buff air anchor and never chainsaw most of the time as its consistent. However, if you sacrifice enough lalafells, just do chainsaw and enjoy being #1 Crystal as you can 1v5 (I've had a machinist do a triple kill chainsaw once in silver and it has scarred me since).

RDM - Redmage hovers btw A and S, I've seen good and bad ranking up, it is less consistent than SMN in damage, but in the hands of a good player you can do anything with it. However, there are so few good rdm players so I can't form a solid opinion, you either get a rdm that does everything or a rdm that is busy twirling their sword.

B

Reaper -Normally I would place Reaper in straight F tier as useless trash, but there is one REALLY good reaper player in Diamond and it is the only reaper I've seen since Gold. So maybe they know something we don't. But you will almost never see reaper in Plat+ unless its that one guy and he's really good.

C- Tier, yup straight to C

Monk - It is ok at the lower ranks due to their aoe, but ninja/sam/drg does everything a mnk does, but better. they have better burst, maneuverability and lbs. Monk has great AOE don't get me wrong, but players are almost never gonna be grouped up for you to be effective and being able to burst 1 player down to 0 quick is more valuable than AOE. Overall it needs buffs. It is so bad I've seen one monk player since Plat, ONE and they were mediocre.

F Tier

Dancer - I have not a seen a single dancer since silver. In the past 130 games. They aren't real. I do not have any strong opinions on dancer, but know that you won't see them. So I assume they are trash.

BLM - Same as Dancer, no strong opinions, but no one plays BLM in high elo.

DRK - Same as the two above, no DRK, except I've seen 1, in my entire time pvping.

FFF tier

Gnb - It is quite known that GNB is the worst. How do I know this? The 2 times I've had a GNB in Diamond +. People on the time would literally AFK in base. and ping the GNB. This has happened twice. I whisper them afterwards and they basically said they would rather AFK as we weren't going to win anyway. I don't know if they are bad or not. But every game I've had a gnb, people in Crystal and Diamond would  rather afk in base rather than try. This has happened TWICE with different players, no other class has garnered this reaction.

As a closing note, literally don't use any of the guides provided on reddit if you want to seriously pvp and please stop pinging Good Match after the first fight is lost."

[Static] [Primal] [LFM] [Savage] [Ultimate] 6 of 8 Static Looking for Tank and Non-phys Ranged DPS,FFXIVRECRUITMENT,tfvs03,2022-03-16 19:05:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIVRECRUITMENT/comments/tfvs03/static_primal_lfm_savage_ultimate_6_of_8_static/,NevermoreAK,Primal DC (NA),"Hey everyone, my friend and I are looking to put a static together since most ones that are advertising now only do Tuesday or Thursday, and we aren't available those days.

&#x200B;

**About Us:**

We are a raiding duo that have done savage since Eden's Verse (mid-late 2019). We didn't have a lot of time to get high parses on that tier, but we did manage blues on some fights and prog on most of E8S before the tier ended. We went back and cleared after, but haven't gotten our mounts yet. We came into Eden's Promise and cleared the tier with relative speed, often rounding out a fight in about 3-4 sessions at max, depending on the rest of our group's prog speed. We've now gotten week one clears on P1S and P2S, but our static fell apart due to a difference in priority. The two of us are fairly high skill players, we had purple parses for most of last tier and this one so far; but some tension built up in our group as we are a bit more ""tryhard"" than most of the rest of our static. That isn't to say that we don't acknowledge that people make mistakes and don't want to have fun or meme about a little; but spending multiple raid nights with no effective progression does tend to get us a bit stressed. So, to keep our friendship with those members from dying due to an argument about prog speed, we decided to bow out.

&#x200B;

We're currently on Fountains of Fire prog for P3S, but we're willing to walk back a bit to somewhere in P2S at the most. This is relatively fine with us since I'm swapping roles from healer to either caster or melee depending on how the rest of the roster fills; so I'll need a bit of gear from P2S anyways.

&#x200B;

\*Other Stuff to Brag About:\*We both had week one clears on some of the Eden's Promise raids. We both have Delubrum Reginae Savage clears, and I have an ultimate clear on UWU.

&#x200B;

I can provide logs upon request.

&#x200B;

**Current Roster:**

*Tanks:*

WAR

&#x200B;

*DPS:*

RPR  
RDM  
MCH  


*Healers:*

AST  
SGE

&#x200B;

**Expectations:**

\* Show up

\* Show up on time once we set it

\* Be reasonably prepared for raid (aka, don't regularly hold things up for food, pots, etc. Or at least don't hold up for more than a couple of minutes)

\* Don't be an ass

\* Have reasonable logs, we'll be checking them to make sure we don't have a repeat where there's a big disparity between skill level / ""tryhard-ness""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Proposed Times:**

We're leaving specific time of day in the air until we get a group formed, but we're looking for some combination of Monday, Wednesday, Friday. If we do three days, then we're thinking something around two hours per night. If we do two nights, then probably three hours on reclear night for both reclears and some prog, and then two hours on the following night for prog so that we don't have just three straight hours of slamming our faces on the wall without some sort of mental refresh. Obviously, this is up to group decision, but that was our way of thinking.

Economic efficiency 1/2,ASTSpaceMobile,safaxi,2022-01-22 18:31:52,70,0.97,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/safaxi/economic_efficiency_12/,CatSE---ApeX---,DD,"**TL/DR** This writeup will touch on different aspects of AST SpaceMobile, and the context it is in, from the perspective  of **efficiency** and **effectiveness**. Concepts that often comes to mind doing DD on this company.

I will compare and contrast some in this writeup, so bear with me, it is not just AST centric.

**Definitions**

There are many words and ways to describe the concepts. And in my own language there is only one word ""effektivitet"", that covers both concepts. We differentiate between inner efficiency (in essence productivity) and outer efficiency that includes a good fit of the product to the demand. But the english language has two different words. So we will start with a definition and some examples of the concepts.

    Effectiveness - Doing the right thing.

This concept is about the capability of producing a desired result. And as a society, not just as a business we can desire this.

LetÂ´ s hear Arthur on effectiveness in the context of communications. Take it away Arthur!

[Sir Arthur C. Clarke. Inventor of the communications satellite.](https://preview.redd.it/0cfdxspmpad81.jpg?width=507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28051bd14d7366d556a9e7d31d41989bddf83c9c)

>**Don't commute. Communicate!**  
>  
>\-Arthur c. Clarke

Let's reflect on that quote and a recent FAA-FCC quarrel of airplanes and 5g frequencies. What Arthur was saying in 1977 was not that we shouldn't ever get on an airplane again. But he did predict things like smartphones, videoconferences and the internet. And said that we more often should opt to communicate instead of commuting. Much like most of us also do today.

Why did he think so, and why did we do so? Because it is more ***effective*** in a lot of scenarios.NB. Not in all scenarios. But pandemics makes more of them.

And as such, the US society / government is not very effective these days when giving airlines priority over 5g networks to suitable 5g spectrum that is used already all over the world.

The way things are that will gravitate swiftly towards a more effective way. In a society  there are strong forces that pushes things in the direction of effectiveness. There can be detours to that goal. It can take time. But eventually effective ways to do things usually prevail as societies evolve.

Let us consider communication at a broader sense. There are rural/sparse and urban/dense areas, there is mobile and fixed point communications, land sea and air, narrow and broad band requirement. And so there will be a lot of solutions. What I am getting at here is that there will be room for many techniques in parallel and they can all be effective for their specific market segment.

Being effective for one market segment does not mean that the same approach is effective for the rest of the market.

Let us look at some maps.

[Nordic countries. Optical fibre home broadband speeds.](https://preview.redd.it/26aipkd3tad81.jpg?width=5782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899454831618bd2621bcbfda634bf68b363cdf95)

I live in a rural part of Sweden where \~90% of households has 100mbps internet connection through optical fibre networks, and most of those that do not has access but opted not to connect. USA has twice the population density of Sweden. Norway is a very similar country, but has a jagged shoreline and mountains that make the deployment more expensive. Denmark with a population density higher than both USA and Sweden has a very high percentage of households with high internet speed.

&#x200B;

[USA. Counties where thee Percentage of people having the FCC broadband speed of 25 mbps is at least 15&#37; Map is from may 10 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/mq75qodcvad81.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=03d73a60f8dca117cfcb2abd1e5250e55dde2520)

If broadband access was a problem in the USA before 2020, the pandemic turned it into a crisis. As everyday businesses moved online, city council meetings or court proceedings became near-inaccessible to anyone whose connection couldnât support a Zoom call.  Many could not as the map [above](https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data) shows.

We can conclude that the sparsely populated northern part of Sweden has better internet speeds than densely populated counties in USA.

We can conclude that the USA has a less effective optical fibre network. There are now big programs starting to ramp up to correct some of this. But the USA is a bit late to the party.

Still there are areas in Sweden that are impractical and expensive to connect. There are use cases for Starlink / Kuiper internet connections. Remote Islands, remote inland settlements, non temporary deployments in the terrain. But they are rare and far between.

And so this cycles back to the fact that what is effective for one segment is not effective solution for all segments.

[Pareto principle](https://preview.redd.it/d6szb0q3zad81.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dcb8a181ac23a888338938fbb9b48d4eec0f749)

>The Pareto principle states that **for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes**. In other words, a small percentage of causes have an outsized effect.

Let us reflect on the Pareto principle and USA v/s Sweden. It is my assumption that the optical fibre infrastructure of the USA has largely been left to the market economy to solve. and Pareto principle has it that when with a certain technology 80% of the lucrative market has been covered that is when 20% of the effort has been made. So it is a shortcoming of the markets to build an effective infrastructure, all by themselves, as they only strive to be efficient in the sense of profitable.

In Sweden, part of network building has been subsidized with a percentage of costs ranging between 40-70% of costs for a long period of time. There is a parallel goal for cellular connectivity coverage in force and the coverage is equally good. So a whole lot more households were profitable to connect, by means of decades long government intervention.

And so even with a high level of subsidies you reach that point where - for the society as a whole - a certain technology/ concept is no longer effective. It is very rare that 100% of the effort should be with one single technology / concept.

And so to boil this down to company level, being effective in Sweden building optical fibre broadband used to be a different thing than doing it in the USA. Because the desired outcome was different, in the sense the tax payers did not desire to pay the expansion of network with subsidies in the US. And so, as I presume, an effective company in the US stayed within the limits of where people paid the true cost. And an effective company in Sweden expanded beyond that on a good fit to harvest the subsidies. So both the society as a whole and a company can be effective.

    Efficiency - Doing it right.

&#x200B;

[Optical fibre network processor in Sweden. Image is a decade old. An efficient machine.](https://preview.redd.it/mecqn2mnwad81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a129f6a99a20905857f8e37f46e18fd3bcf8510)

The above machine is in a poplar plantation. At that latitude this crop produces most biomass per acre and year. So the image shows an efficient machine and an efficient crop at this particular location. What is efficient is sometimes pending climate and geology.

And with the swedish way of putting it, (we say inner efficiency where the US just says efficiency). Efficiency is more about the inner workings of the company.  Whereas effectiveness involved the fit to the market and the governments regulatory framework. Efficiency is just about producing as much output as possible with as little input as possible. Albeit that output is measured both by its quality to specifications and its quantity, not just quantity.

    Economic efficiency.
    
    Economy theory has its own definition of efficiency. 
    Economic efficiency is when all goods and factors of production in an 
    economy are distributed or allocated to their most valuable uses and
    waste is eliminated or minimized. 
    Often when we use the word efficiency we mean this. 
    And economic efficiency really is a the combination of
    efficiency and effectiveness. 
    
    And it is the meaning of the swedish single word ""effektivitet"". 
    For the purpose of this writeup however we seperate between the two concepts. 
    But acknowledge that as a society and in a company we want both.

Why is efficiency important for a company then?

Well a business needs to be profitable and the equation for the profit margin is very similar to the equation of efficency.

    Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses

In real estate, the operating expense ratio (OER) is a measurement of the cost to operate a piece of property, compared to the income brought in by the property. Simplified it goes like this:

    Operating expense ratio = operating expense / gross operating income.

Compare OER above to the formula for efficiency below. And you see how a high level of efficiency directly translates to a low OER, and thus higher efficiency - all else equal - translates to higher profit.

    Efficiency= Total output / Total input 

And business is a game of survival of the fittest, where you both need to be effective and deliver what the market (and regulators) desire, and produce that in an efficient way. Or you will be put out of business by the competition. Either by a better - more effective - product, or a cheaper - more efficient - way of making it, or both.

**LTV: CAC = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost**

    LTV:CAC ratio = LTV/CAC
    
    The Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition (LTV:CAC) ratio measures the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer, and the cost of acquiring that customer. The metric is computed by dividing LTV by CAC. It is a signal of customer profitability, and of sales and marketing efficiency.

For a hypergrowth company it is often stated that the LTV:CAC needs to be 3 or higher.

For a Starlink customer swapping his antenna three times in 15 years at a total subsidy of 1000 USD + other customer acquisiton costs such as sales of 200 USD the lifetime value in those 15 years of that customer needs to be about 3 times that or 3600 USD or the business will have trouble. There is a hint in that calculation that the proprietary, quite expensive, VSAT phased array / electronically steered antennas, will be prohibitively expensive to reach some customer segments. Such as low income customers. This dilemma is true for almost every Low Earth Orbit constellation in the works. Kuiper, OneWeb, Starlink to mention some.

And when we compare and contrast this with AST concept, where you just need COTS external 4g/5g antenna for fixed, or tablet/phone/dongle for mobile. We see a dramatic difference in CAC:LTV ratio.

And that is a more efficient network / business-model compare and contrast these two formulas:

LTV:CAC ratio = LTV/CAC

Efficiency= Total output / Total input

Simply put, a device that either the user already posses, like a cell phone, or can buy at the cheap without subsidies is to be preferred in any market and is absolutely essential in low income markets.

Out of the \~1% in the US using Starlink type connection. Nearly half (44%) wanted to swap connection to another type because it was too expensive.

**Mobile versus Fixed.**

AST type connection is mobile. with the option to use it stationary. This is effectiveness in that it provides a functionality that is desired by the market segment it address. And as we know from fixed landlines versus cellular connectivity the market

U.S. household consumes over 11 times more data over fixed networks versus mobile access. However, when a study compared service revenue generated from actual GB delivered, it found that consumers place roughly 20x more value on mobile broadband than fixed in terms of what theyâre willing to pay for monthly plans. For a more detailed break down, see [this report.](https://mobile-experts.net/reports/p/fixedmobileconvergence21)

This level of fit to the desire of the customer, we now know is an example of effectiveness. Lets say you can afford just one connection. What will that be, fixed or mobile?

**Field of View**

Lets get to network architechture.

&#x200B;

[Footprint of an AST satellite operating Â¨725 km altitude.](https://preview.redd.it/ilc7m2nrgbd81.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a78c063fbb4f39a6fb393ead56c1cca6c2c236a)

&#x200B;

[SpaceX proposed new two -tier V-band constellation, Field of View.](https://preview.redd.it/hjtsxrvugbd81.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b2ae053a2caa06868f1f7f889599e8642791af8)

&#x200B;

[Starlink two-tier v-band constellation, footprints. VLEO sats - small prints. LEO sat - bigger print.](https://preview.redd.it/c9j1a2pzgbd81.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a1a15aa4d3c2cc9431429cfe448eb6107a485)

&#x200B;

[I made this. Black is the Field of view of an AST satellite 20 degrees above horizon. The green colour is Starlink v-band LEO and the magenta is Starlink v-band VLEO field of view.](https://preview.redd.it/t2kwo42ehbd81.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f079f182b1b0f93e2aa08cedcc6ec3496a1afe12)

Consider the above image. With the wider field of view of AST satellites (black), they can reach customers at shorter distance than the corresponding proposed  Starlink satellite in LEO can. Meanwhile the VLEO sats must be very much more numerous to reach customers everywhere within the footprint of the LEO sats.

It is apparent to me that, because of more narrow field of view, the Starlink concept buillds a more complex and less efficient system. The total capacity of the AST satellite can be freely distributed from a relatively low orbit within the entire footprint. Starlink goes high to get the field of view, but loses throughput in this way and has to add VLEO that are very inefficent as to their usable/total capacity ratio.

We know that AST has chosen a foldable dish antenna for their backhaul, and an larger phased array for their fronthaul. The former has [no degradation of its directivity/gain within the steeerabele range](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/s04nkh/qv_band_backhaul_attenuation/). The latter is large enough so that it can form a [highly directive beam at the edge of its very wide 116 degree field of view](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/rp7va3/ast_spacemobile_constellation_beamforming_width/).

These are the reasons why [Barclays in their report](https://pdfhost.io/v/C0G~b~5c3_Barclays_AST_SpaceMobile_Researchpdf) upon initiation of coverage and a $29 price target modeled a 30% usable capacity, whereas the normal for a LEO constellation is just 10%.

That is the result of two design choices on antenna, that differs from Starlink and other LEO concepts, and gives AST wider FoV. Please note that 3/10 usable capacity is 3x or 200% more efficient than just using 1/10 as is the LEO norm. The design choices of the  big array of AST satellites and the Q/V band antenna steerable dish should ne understood in this context. by the concept of optimizing for the highest possible efficiency.

Compare and contrast.

    Usable capacity ratio = Usable capacity / Total capacity.

Efficiency= Total output / Total input

**Mass production and costs.**

By statement of the CEO \~90% of the satellite cost is in the array and its near identical micron panels, made up bit identical subsystems well suited for mass  production. This brings economy of scale and keeps satellite costs (input in the formula above) down. Also an highly efficient concept.

[And while we are at Barclays report. These are their estimates of throughput, and the CapEX stated at that point in time for ASIC \/ SoC Bluebirds. That is 1,200 Gbps per sat max throughput according to Barclays.](https://preview.redd.it/s8eysbeolbd81.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c35098ac129822343908e6c875bc67c845cde5c)

Note in the chart above how AST Bluebirds combine the small CapEX, capital expenditure of conventional small sats with the very high throughput of expensive GEO VHTS satellites. It is as disruptive as it is highly cost-efficient, and as such extremely competitive. Chart is from my WSB writeup.[Highly recommended reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/) for context / overview. 

The disruptive ratio above is the result of modular design, mass production, reduced launch costs, and the use of extreme throughput wide bandwidth v-band in the backhaul and an extreme amount of beams and user links in the fronthaul.

And what I am getting at here is that this focus on efficency and effectiveness combined in design choices and int the businessmodel is no coincidence. To the extent I am cutting this writeup in two, to fit all examples.

\*\*The regulatory context.   Not always as efficient.\*\*But as an politician in my home country, I will say this, the regulatory framework, and the pace and processes of the regulators themselves leave something more to desire in what I have witnessed so far of ASTs contacts with US authorities and how they go about connecting USA and the world, and how they treat their Space entrepreneurs.In that particular, regulatory, part. As for the pace of SpaceMobile and Bluewalker 3 applications. An much needed overhaul of secondary market rules. The lagging deployment of optical fibre networks. The very hap-hazard rollout of 5g stopped by altimeters, and so forth. Here I see a lot of room for improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

I will say this. The FCC has done some things right. Of relevance to AST: They fastforwarded new spectrum sharing rules that were decided in december, so the round that closed in november could get started. And they recently held a successful auction of 5g C-band spectrum.

But more of this is needed. Or the US nation risks falling behind, it risks being less competitive. It should fast-forward new disruptive highly efficient technologies for a more efficient use of the scarce resource spectrum. Yet regulatory process lingers, it seems anxious and has a slow pace. The regulators needs better to embrace progress and innovation. A new more efficient formfactor for communications satellites should be faster welcomed, than what we so far have seen

Is this best way to withdraw BTC?,NiceHash,rt3hyt,2021-12-31 16:17:11,2,0.76,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceHash/comments/rt3hyt/is_this_best_way_to_withdraw_btc/,exitof99,Discussion,"I'm in the US, but there are free withdrawals using Euro to bank account.

---

I just learned that NiceHash Exchange doesn't allow US users to trade. Kibosh activated. My ideas below are now useless.

---

Okay, so I don't know if there is a way to select a lower mining fee (slower transaction) with NiceHash, but there are plenty of other assets with far lower transaction fees (XLM, DOGE, NANO).

What I'm thinking is a better play is to make use of the trade section of the NiceHash website to convert to a different crypto, then withdraw.

But the problem is there are so many unknowns here, the NiceHash fee page seems insane, it's saying a transaction fee of $62.50 for withdrawing USDC!!! WHAT???

Then there are others like XLM (Stellar) that says 0.005 XLM withdraw, and with XLM at 27Â¢, that would be 0.135Â¢.

Then there are the trade fees, which are shown to be 0.5% taker/maker, though these fees go down over time if your all-time trades total the next tier. Once you've traded past 1000 EUR, you are permanently at 4% taker/maker, and so on.

This in itself is a bit of a motivation to keep the funds in the NiceHash wallet and maybe do some day trading locally.

Anyway, looking to withdraw the cheapest, the method I'm thinking of is:

1. Trade to XLM (and try to trade up when XLM spikes)

2. Lose 0.5% in trade fees

3. Withdraw to whatever exchange you wish

4. Lose ~0.005 XLM

5. Trade back to BTC on your favored exchange (hopefully trade up again)

Let me know your thoughts. I'm about to try this out, but am interested to hear other ideas.

Monk stands up for leaver White Mage,TalesFromDF,qofjws,2021-11-06 22:50:09,102,0.95,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromDF/comments/qofjws/monk_stands_up_for_leaver_white_mage/,Kalosyni,,"TL;DR in the image, rest of the story below, enjoy!  


So let me preface with my sentences are short because I still do not have a wireless PS5 compatible keyboard and R1 is still my very best friend. Anyway, we zone into Shisui for our leveling roulette, that rules because I'm 65 and need the EXP as I finish grinding my last 3 classes to 80 prior to Endwalker, and everything seems fine, all players are talking and wiggling around in the entrance gate, cool! Healer is geared in full 66 HQ crafted so beyond geared for Shisui, Monk is wearing full Shisui gear, PLD is wearing a combination of Shire & Alexandrian, looks to be HWard BiS. Cool!   


I think to myself, ""Well, this oughta be an easy run."" and hit peloton, the PLD & I start jogging off with the WHM & MNK in tow, we get to the first pull and Paladin grabs the first 3 adds before continuing on to the wall next to the jumpy fountain, I pan my screen around and see both the MNK and WHM just kind of... awkwardly waddling from side to side thinking about whether or not they want to commit to something as hard as Shisui ""SAVAGE PULLING.""   


I'm not going to dillydally, I've been putting my dots up as I walked, so I pop raging strikes & mage's ballad and start spamming Quick Knock like the good little bard I am, and while I'm doing this from the safety of my dangercone, I notice that the PLD's health is plummeting and... the MNK and WHM are still not here. By the time both of them have finally decided to join us in the pull the PLD has 3k hp and I've quick knocked the mobs nearly to death, WHM throws a bene, alright good st-- immediately starts casting... Medica I. Not Medica II, no, Medica I. On just the PLD. Then swaps to spamming Cure I, gets her free cure, and swaps back to Medica I!   


We finish the first pull and the PLD stops to let the WHM know ""Hey, Cure II is better and more efficient than Cure I."", checking the PLD's search info they're apparently a BiS Astro w/ all healers at 80, not that I doubted them anyway. They skipped over other, probably better and more proper advice, but I've seen how trying to give more advice than ""Cure I not very good past level 3X."" goes, WHM seems receptive but drops a strange sentence about DOTs, none of which they actually casted, and we continue on. While the WHM, Myself, and the PLD walk to the next pull, the MNK once more stands completely still to let us know that we're in the wrong because the PLD had walked off and pulled once the dungeon had started, apparently a blasphemous act to this monk.   


We hit the next pull and ofc the PLD continues to the wall once more and whaddya know- the healer is using Cure II--- except they're using it over and over again, weaving some Medica I's in-between for good measure. The entire pull is dead save for the 3 Orobon that emerge from the ground once other stuff in the pull is dead and I see the white mage casting Holy! Alright, their hearts in the right place, a little late, but y'know, it never hurts! Except for the fact they're about 20yalms from the pull standing in the middle of nowhere. Once the 3 fish are dead and our WHM's mana is thoroughly womped from spamming Holy on the open air, I let them know, ""Holy is melee, jsyk o/"" throwing in a little wave to let them know I mean NO ill-will whatsoever. Well this is apparently the straw that broke the camels back.   


The WHM immediately leaves the dungeon without so much as another word and the MNK leaps to her defense like the yowling catgirl they are, limbs flailing everywhere about how awful the PLD is for kicking the WHM. Except the dungeon hasn't even been going on long enough for a vote kick to even go out! The PLD & I both try to explain, but the MNK is hung-up on the fact that we ~~pelotoned~~  sprinted away from them, like, really hung up on it? Also upset that we ""Told them how to do their job when they were doing fine."" I'm not sure if the MNK is aware, but casting AOE heals when only one person is taking damage and nearly letting them die to 3 adds while they ran in circles is in fact the opposite of doing fine.    


Incredulously, I hit them with the ""Lmao???"", I should've left while I had time, so should the PLD, we both had an easy out and we were only at the first boss of Shisui! Instead we wait for a backfill healer, and here comes the full crown astro out of nowhere w/ no context to the conversation at all IMMEDIATELY opening with ""i don't sprint so you may die if you do that lol""   


So either, A. This is a very funny coinkydink, or B. This is the MNKs friend coming to their rescue (and validation!), we aren't going to assume A because I did nothing to deserve this form of cosmic punishment. Our Paladin goes quiet, but continues on to the boss anyway. I get bound by the murder lobster and he summons his little red murder lobster to come to his aid, I'm shooting the little guy with the help of the PLD but luck has decided I am not allowed to have procs as a bard and so the Acid Rains actually go out... Only for both the MNK and AST to run over dropping both of their acid rains on the tank in what looked to me like an obvious griefing attempt. PLD is fine because those AOE's tickle, thankfully the AST and MNK apparently didn't want to grief ME and were smacking the lobsters legs so I don't get to finally see what happens if you don't free the person by leg-sweeping the death lobster.   


I ask both of them why they dropped their AOE's on the PLD, and the MNK lies through their god damned teeth, I'm assuming to save face in the event I or the PLD decide to report them.  


Realistically, the rest of the dungeon was very uneventful, we walked everywhere, if I hit peloton the MNK and AST both slowed down in an obvious act of defiance, the AST would only use Essential Dignity AFTER a benefic 2 but at the very least they used 3 or 4 gravities per pull and threw out cards.   


The MNK lagged behind every chance they could, stared at me frequently, & jumped around me as if they were a bird doing some sort of fucked up mating ritual that I was very not into. The last boss goes down but not without the MNK waiting until we were at 0.8% to LB in true Duty Finder fashion. The PLD leaves as soon as they can, not even rolling on loot, the AST throws a GG and bails, and the MNK walks over to me, hits me with the sweet /pet, and lets me know they had NOTHING against me, it was JUST the PLD they were mad at.   


I guess they weren't aware I was on the PLD's side, probably thought I was just some poor BRD following in the trail of some toxic PLD who left too early. Oh well, I'll never know because I blacklisted them following the encounter and hope to never run into them again.

TLDR;  
**Don't be a dumb fuck. Do your own research on HOW to do you own research!**  
**Learn how to properly research before you research cryptos as an investment.**

I was wrong.

Let this be fair warning to people who might believe they are doing their own research and due diligence on a coin - especially new comers and inexperienced investors

Before I share my highly relatable and boring story, my recommendation to you is -Learn, study and master business research skills. Learn to look into a business so deeply that you are so well informed, that you can LOGICALLY determine whether said business is over or undervalued and to have clear reasons why.

>Be DFV before the GME explosion!

I began my crypto journey in September of 2017 - after a friend mentioned BTC to me. I thought - I can't justify spending $7000 AUD on a single coin... So I began researching altcoins, where my $1 would buy 4, or 40 coins, instead of 0.000128 of a Bitcoin.

I had believed that the potential growth of a 25c coin was much greater than the already $7k BTC (remember, talking AUD here).

And I was right - my two smart investments in XLM and XEM quickly sent me from an initial investment of $9k up to $21k. **I'm a fuckin' genius and I'm gonna be rich!**

Come peak of 2018 - I was a day trader, I told friends and family about crypto and I told people I would be a millionaire by end of 2018. Still, through January to March, I continued researching other low value coins which looked to have promising futures.

I invested hours, day and night studying these small cap coins, believing I found the next great projects which had great fundamentals, great ideas, great whitepapers (didn't read all the whitepapers all the way through) - and to be fair - I don't know what 70% of the whitepapers are talking about because I don't know about or understand any of the tech and how it will serve its purpose and help solve a problem.

To add to the distress - to obtain most of these coins - I needed access to different exchanges and one of which was Cryptopia (New Zealand). And for those who are unaware - Cryptopia was ""Hacked"" and peoples tokens are now locked up while the company goes into liquidation. **So perhaps the advice here is to do your DD on the exchanges you are using - are they allowed to operate in their country?**

**This is going to be embarrassing, but here are my promising future investments (Gems as I referred to them in my spreadsheet) from 2018.**

**Ticker - Name - Invested**

* TIX - Blocktix - $1,278
* ZAP - Zap - $3,858
* VRC - Vericoin - $1,463
* BAY - BitBay - $1,473
* XAS - Asch - $1,369
* GVT - Genesis Vision Token - $1,466
* CPC - CP Chain - $3,960
* CGC - CGCOINS - $917
* OAX - OAX - $1,523
* VIB - Viberate - $1,461
* ECA - Electra (Shitcoin I was hoping for a gamble) - $612
* ACT - AChain - $22,849
* RHOC - RChain - $1,321
* AST - AirSwap - $1,524
* DENT - Dent - $1,083
* PHR - Phore - $1,587
* AION - Aion - $1,471
* MED - Medibloc - $595
* EXRN - EXRNchain (Shitcoin I was hoping for a gamble) - $191
* XSH - Shield - $742
* PFR - PayFair - $1,249
* ARY - Blockarray - $372
* BERRY - Rentberry - $255
* COB - Cobinhood (Trading token on Cobinhood exchange - same concept as BNB) - $4,369
* ERA - ERA (Shitcoin I was hoping for a gamble) - $100
* AOA - AuroraChain (Token swap for Achain holders I believe, there was no investment here)

Now, we are in 2021. And some of these coins have been delisted from exchanges and coinmarketcap.Some are unsalvageable after Cryptopia has gone into liquidation. Some have completely disappeared from my MetaMask Account.

And the rest are worthless compared to where they were in Q1 of 2018.

So if we calculate the numbers above, **I would say my loss is approximately;**

**$57,000 AUD.**

**That, my friends - is a year of earnings and HINDSIGHT is mother-fuckin' 20-20.**

The moral of the story is - I thought I was smart and I wasn't. I thought I would beat the system and get into small cap coins and watch another 5x 10x gain like I did in my first few months of Crypto.

I - along with many others I believe, have made the same mistakes and have learned.

I hope that perhaps after reading my post - some new comers will feel the pain from my lost, listen and learn to research before they invest in anything - this way they aren't left scratching their head asking why they lost their money.

And FYI - the $57,000 AUD I lost was from the profit I made on my XEM and XLM investments. I used the profits to buy other coins and regret it. I had one person tell me to take some out. All of reddit said - take out your initial investment so if it goes down you still have the money you originally put in.

Reddit and the rest of the universe said to take some profit - take some out from that $100,000 profit you made - enjoy the year, go on a nice holiday, buy a car, pay off your college or university debt. Pay back your parents, pay off your mortgage, get married, engaged, jacked, botox, breast implants.

Don't be a dumb fuck like me."

I know Airswap (AST) isnât a real moonshot because it has a $30M marketcap. But just hear me out, it has a lot of potential, which I will explain in this long post! It will probably start of a bit confusing, but it will all make sense in the end. 

**TL;DR at the bottom for you lazy retards.** But I do recommend you read the whole post.

AirSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) which was created by Fluidity. It was originally made for large companies to trade OTC and without an orderbook to avoid frontrunning.

In May 2020, Fluidity (the team behind AirSwap) was acquired by ConsenSys[\[1\]](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-acquires-fluidity-team-and-technology/). This is a **BIG** deal. ConsenSys was founded in 2014 by Joseph Lubin. Joseph is **also** a co-founder of Ethereum. The company has now more than 500 employees. ConsenSys is also the company behind MetaMask, which is the **most popular** Ethereum wallet and Web3 browser. In August 2020, ConsenSys acquired Quorum from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Which is an enterprise blockchain platform developed by JPMorgan Chase. Additionally, JPMorgan has made an undisclosed strategic investment in ConsenSys[\[2\]](https://www.coindesk.com/consensys-acquires-jp-morgan-quorum-blockchain). 

As you see, ConsenSys is a **BIG** deal. 

Now back to AirSwap. 

In October 2020, Airswap launched âAirswap Improvement Proposalsâ (AIPs). Community members can now propose what they want to change. The community can then vote with their AST tokens. There have been around ten votes so far, but AIP 7 is by far the most interesting one. It was unanimously accepted by the community, which says enough if you ask me. It proposes that you can stake your AST and get rewarded with transaction fees and governance. Coming 9th of February.

Also in October 2020, ConsenSys introduced MetaMask Swaps. Which brings the feature to swap tokens directly within MetaMask. MetaMask checks the price of tokens with multiple decentralized exchanges, and gives you the best deal. Hereâs the catch, MetaMask asks a 0.875% fee. AirSwap helped MetaMask with creating the contract behind MetaMask Swaps. The funny thing is, Airswap gets more than $2M of volume each day through MetaMask Swaps. And MetaMask Swaps isnât even available on their mobile app as of yet!

AIP 7 proposes that there will be a pool for stakeholders to receive transaction fees. A co-founder of AirSwap, Don Mosites, said in Discord that the transaction fee from MetaMask will be split. Will it be split evenly or not?

Letâs do the math!

When AirSwap gets 0.25% (they will probably get more). This will go 100% to the stakeholders pool. This means: $2M \* 365 days \* 0.25% = $1.83M each year will be deposited to the pool. When looking at the earlier AIPs, we saw around 10M AST who voted. Keep in mind that this number will probably be lower. Because AIP 7 proposed that you can only unstake 10% each 7 days. Voting for AIPâs does not require staking as of yet. But letâs go with 10M AST for now. 1.83M / 10M = $0.183. That means for every AST staked, you get $0.183 annually. AST currently trades around $0.22. This is 83% APY! Anybody would easily pay at least $0.60 for these returns. And thatâs almost worst case scenario! It will be much higher if: 

1. Less stakeholders than 10M AST.

2. MetaMask splits the fees with AirSwap or gives them a higher percentage. 

3. Volume gets higher on MetaMask Swaps, meaning more transaction fees.

All of the above is not to unimaginable. The time to unstake takes a few weeks because you can only unstake 10% each 7 days. If I would have to guess, I think the amount staked will be much lower than 10M AST. MetaMask and AirSwap are owned by the same company, ConsenSys. So it wonât be strange if they split the transaction fees evenly amongst the two parties, or hell give AirSwap even more. The volume traded on MetaMask Swaps will no doubt be higher the coming months. Imagine if they release it on their mobile app, Iâm sure it will skyrocket.

Lastly, AirSwap is already being traded on Binance. No more sketchy exchanges! You can buy this straight from Binance! 

Join the subreddit at r/AirSwap and definitely join the [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io) to talk with fellow ASTronauts about the token!

Please DYOR, Iâm just here to have an open discussion. And of course not financial advice. I just really like the ~~stock~~ token

TL;DR: AirSwap has some great fundamentals. With upcoming staking, it will be inevitable for the price to make a huge jump. Otherwise you would have a huge APY! If this got your interest, please read my post, it will cost you 5 minutes max. Your wifeâs boyfriend will thank you for it."
