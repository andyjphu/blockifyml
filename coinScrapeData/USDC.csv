Are you on the Hype defi train?,defi,1i9vz0d,2025-01-25 15:18:38,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1i9vz0d/are_you_on_the_hype_defi_train/,ma6ic,:strategy: DeFi Strategy,"I haven't seen much posted about DeFi or Hyperliquid in this sub, so hoping this reaches some new eyes. There are returns on stablecoin yield that blow traditional finance out of the water.

Hyperliquid is a spot and perpetuals exchange that lets any user deposit USDC into their market maker and earn APR based on user demand. It's been 27% for the last month and reaches 30% regularly. It ranges between 20-30% mostly.

That is crazy value for stablecoin yield and there is only a 4-day lockup after each deposit, so the unstaking is pretty liquid.

There's a lot of great coin recommendations in the this sub, but I've seen very little on HYPE, which is a massive opportunity. It's a newer coin with a rabid userbase who is mostly just not on Reddit. Here's a little background on Hyperliquid just for context.

Hyperliquid really made a name for itself in 2024 with what was basically the biggest airdrop of all time—over $10 billion worth of tokens dropped directly to the community. From day one, it attracted a ton of users who tried it, loved it, and ended up building an insanely tight-knit community. People even created supporting products like HypurrFun, pvp.trade, and HypurrScan to build around it.

At the core, Hyperliquid’s tech just *worked* as a good perp DEX should:

* It handled high trading volumes even when the markets were all over the place.
* Spreads were tight, and the liquidity for alts was better than most.
* Just overall, it was smooth and profitable to trade there compared to other platforms.

But what made it stand out was how creative it got:

* Vaults let regular users step into roles like market makers or liquidators (normally reserved for big players).
* Deposits didn’t just sit there—they earned yield and added to liquidity depth.
* A portion of liquidation fees went back into those vaults, which was a win for users.

They also introduced HLP, where users could benefit from both trading *and* contributing to the platform’s liquidity. It was designed to make everyone an active part of the ecosystem.

Oh, and let’s not forget that airdrop—310 million tokens (\~$10 billion in HYPE liquidity). It was on another level, to the point that it created this huge initial push for adoption.

The tokenomics? Super healthy. No VC allocations, no paid market makers. All the fees are reinvested back into the product to benefit users, which is pretty rare.

And this is just the beginning. Hyperliquid isn’t just a DEX—they’re building out an entire ecosystem with dApps on their HyperEVM, a high-performance chain with HyperBFT consensus that keeps everything familiar for developers.

Also, the way they’ve grown is wild. No VC funding. No big marketing campaigns. Everything has been completely community-driven. They basically bootstrapped their way into becoming one of the most talked-about platforms out there.

TLDR: Hyperliquid dropped a killer product that’s both profitable and fun to use, created an ecosystem where the community actually benefits, and kicked it all off with an insane airdrop that got everyone’s attention. Seems like they’re just getting started."

WE NEED USDC,algorand,1i9ujgy,2025-01-25 14:15:46,11,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/algorand/comments/1i9ujgy/we_need_usdc/,Due-Albatross-2253,ASA ,"Or any other Stable. So as we can all see the node rewards are 99 percent incentive.  If we want this network to be self-sustaining we to need to push these numbers. Our TPS sits in the 30s/40s sometimes spiking into the 100s. These are rookie numbers. The fees are so low on ALGO that we need to be reaching well into the thousands if we want this to start moving to a self-sustaining model. 

Large projects like Fifa, Travel X and whatever Italy has going on will generate plenty of transaction but not enough at least not enough for now. That brings me to us the retail sector/DEFI here on Algorand. We need to start doing our part to improve transactions and like a good little capitalist make money while doing it. 

Liquidity pools. For those of you not familiar these are pools set up with a smart contract that allow for the swapping of two assets for example the ALGO/USDC pool on Tinyman allows you to swap your ALGO for USDC and your USDC for ALGO. These is a small fee associated with this swap that goes to the LP providers and the DEX. Also when these swaps are going on the generate transactions on chain collecting the fee that ALGO will eventually become dependent on. 

There are two types of pools Tandem and Stable paired pools. (I call them tandem I don't know an actual name yet.) Tandem pools are two varying assets such as ALGO/TINY or ALGO/CHIPS, These pools help you avoid Impermanent loss while still collecting some fees along the way. Impermanent lose (IL) is an effect of price fluctuations. When two assets diverge greatly from there starting values some assets will be lost in the rebalancing of the pools. This is particularly noticeable with the stable paired pools like ALGO/USDC. 

Tandem pools have the advantage that the price of the two assets are tied very closely together so when one moves the other moves with it. For example the ALGO/CHIPS pool has over 1million in TVL but generates almost no fees. $24 for the day as I currently see it on Tinyman. Having that much TVL and so little trade volume goes to show that there are almost no arbitrage traders working this pool because the prices don't diverge that often.  $8k worth of transaction in the last 24hrs. Which is great if you are just going to keep piling into this pool and you expect the assets to generally climb in value together. Not so great for the network as a whole. 

If you look at the CHIPS/USDC pool we can see a stark difference in volume. This pool has $1,400 worth of TVL. and has a done a whopping $24 in total transactions for the last 24hrs. that comes out to around 1.7 % of the volume being traded. With the tandem pool it comes out to 0.615%. That is more than double the amount of transaction per the TVL comparatively. This is not an isolated case it can be seen on almost every pool that has a stable pair vs a tandem pair. 

These stable paired pools generate double if not more transactions for the network and for the DEX they are on vs the tandem pools. These stable paired pools are horribly underfunded compared to their tandem counterparts. I understand that it is the Fear of IL that most likely keeps people from providing LP to the stable paired pools, but this needs to come to an end. 

Based on these observations It is safe to say that everyone should budget a small amount of their DCA into some of these Sable paired pools. 

Pros: 

1. You will generate a Yield from the fees/reward incentives

2. These will directly influence the amount of transaction on Algorand

  
Cons:

1. IL

With a steady trickle of more liquidity to these pools Algorand will have an increase in TVL, Transactions, and security of the network. If you want to actively Support Algo and make some scratch its a no brainer. Adding to these stable paired pools will have a trickle up effect for all assets that get the benefits of this added liquidity."

I can’t imagine BitPay would make such a huge mistake as to allow this if it were impossible to get it out. Maybe I’m wrong. 

Even if I click directly on the polygon wallet, and generate a deposit address, anything I send to the address seems to default to the ETH chain, and when I try to send the USDC out, it says I don’t have enough MATIC to pay for it.

"Kripto Para Nedir?, Kripto Para Ne Demek?",yatirimdanismanligi,1i9qa7h,2025-01-25 11:11:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yatirimdanismanligi/comments/1i9qa7h/kripto_para_nedir_kripto_para_ne_demek/,dreaministanbul,,"Kripto para, dijital veya sanal bir para birimidir ve işlemleri güvenli hale getirmek için kriptografi teknolojisi kullanılır. Geleneksel para birimlerinden farklı olarak fiziksel bir şekli yoktur ve merkezi bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilmez. Kripto paralar, blockchain adı verilen dağıtık bir defter teknolojisi üzerinde çalışir. Bu teknoloji, tüm işlemlerin şeffaf ve değiştirilemez bir şekilde kaydedilmesini sağlar.

# Kripto Para Çeşitleri

Kripto paralar farklı amaçlara hizmet eden çeşitli türlere ayrılabilir:

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en popüler kripto paradır. 2009 yılında Satoshi Nakamoto takma adıyla biri veya bir grup tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Dijital altın olarak da adlandırılan Bitcoin, bir değer saklama aracı ve ödeme sistemi olarak kullanılır.

# 2. Altcoin’ler

Bitcoin haricindeki tüm kripto paralar “altcoin” olarak adlandırılır. Bazı popüler altcoin’ler şunlardır:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** Akıllı sözleşmeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) için bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):** Hızlı uluslararası ödeme sistemleri için kullanılır.
* **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’in daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hızlı işlem yapılmasını sağlar.

# 3. Stablecoin’ler

Stablecoin’ler, fiyat dalgalanmasını azaltmak için itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altın gibi fiziksel varlıklara endekslenmiştir. Örnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4. Meme Coin’ler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) üzerine kurulu kripto paralardır. Örneğin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5. NFT’ler ve Token’lar

* **NFT’ler (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlıkları temsil eder.
* **Token’lar:** Belirli bir platformda veya ekosistemde kullanılmak için oluşturulan dijital varlıklardır.

# Kripto Paranın Avantajları

Kripto paraları kullanmanın çok sayıda avantajı vardır:

# 1. Merkeziyetsizlik

Kripto paralar, herhangi bir merkezi otoriteye bağlı olmadığı için daha şeffaf ve özgür bir finansal sistem sunar.

# 2. Hızlı ve Düşük Maliyetli İşlemler

Kripto para transferleri genellikle çok hızlıdır ve geleneksel bankacılık sistemine göre daha düşük üretlere sahiptir.

# 3. Sınırsız ve Evrensel Erişim

Kripto paraları kullanmak için bir banka hesabına gerek yoktur. Bir internet bağlantısına sahip herkes, dünyanın her yerinden bu paralara erişebilir.

# 4. Yatırım Fırsatları

Kripto paralar, yüksek getirili bir [**yatırım**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/) aracı olarak popülerlik kazanmıştır. Bitcoin gibi bazı kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatırımlar için tercih edilmektedir.

# 5. Güvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin değiştirilemez ve güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasını sağlar. Bu da kripto paraları geleneksel sistemlere göre daha güvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranın Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken dikkate alınması gereken bazı önemli riskler vardır:

# 1. Fiyat Dalgalanması (Volatilite)

Kripto paraların değeri kısa süre içinde büyük ölçülerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, yüksek kâr getirme potansiyeli olduğu kadar yüksek kayıp riskini de beraberinde getirir.

# 2. Siber Güvenlik Riskleri

Kripto para borsalarının hacklenmesi veya bireysel cüzdanların ele geçirilmesi durumunda kayıplar yaşanabilir.

# 3. Regülasyon ve Yasal Belirsizlikler

Birçok ülkede kripto paraların yasal durumu tam olarak netleşmemiştir. Bu da yasal riskler doğurabilir.

# 4. Teknik Bilgi Eksikliği

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken teknik bilgi eksikliği yanlış kararlar alınmasına neden olabilir.

# 5. Dolandırıcılık ve Ponzi Yapılar

Bazı sahte projeler ve dolandırıcılık amaçlı kripto para girşimleri, yatırımcıları büyük kayıplara uğratabilir.

Kripto paralar, modern finans dünyasını yeniden şekillendiren bir yenilik olarak dikkat çekiyor. Avantajları ve yatırım fırsatları cazip olsa da, beraberinde getirdiği riskleri dikkatlice değerlendirmek önemlidir. Kripto paralara yönelik bir yatırım yapmadan önce detaylı bir araştırma yapmak ve finansal durumunuzu göz önünde bulundurmak önemlidir.

Considerations around using a crypto stable coin (USDC/FRAX) as the paid currency for an MMORPG,legaladvice,1i9pyor,2025-01-25 10:57:38,0,0.4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i9pyor/considerations_around_using_a_crypto_stable_coin/,kinetik95,,"Hi all, hope you’re doing well.

The basic idea is this:

Instead of having players pay real-world money for in-game currency, they would instead receive an equivalent (w/ small fee) amount of stable coins that can be:

- exchanged with other players, possibly with smart contracts that hold and transfer the crypto upon fulfillment of the contract
- spent on in-game items
- freely exchanged with the digital in-game currency that isn’t pegged to a crypto coin (standard currency system you’re used to)
- withdrawn/deposited from their personal crypto wallet at-will


I’m absolutely in love with this idea as it would enable players to interact with each other on deeper levels and even profit from playing the game.  

However, some basic googling revealed that there could be issues with international monetary transfers.

Because the in-game currency is a stable coin, I would hope it doesn’t pass the third check of the Howie test for securities but honestly, I’m so outside of my depth, I have no idea.

What are the most significant legal hurdles to implementing a system of this form?  Are there possible avenues forward despite those hurdles and if so, what is required from me?

If you made it this far, thank you so much ❤️"

I sent the coin to Uniswap and attempted a swap to USDC, only for it to fail. A few minutes later the coin entirely disappeared from my Uniswap wallet and I found a transaction I didn’t initiate: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xac7e264825c7288eb6882aa61b18b6a109c10c680fb6da02ec100973dbee4a46

Alla fine del 2023 il valore era relativamente basso (meno di 3000 euro e accumulati negli anni). Alla fine del 2024 sono diventati circa 6000. Mi conviene metterle nella dichiarazione 2025 nel quadro RW (quello relativo al monitoraggio) o così facendo mi vado a cercare i guai?

  
Un'altra questione riguarda lo staking. Una parte sono in staking (sulla blockchain, non con gli exchange), si tratta di token (non USDC, ma criptovalute volatili). Devo dichiarare plusvalenze anche se non vendo mai niente. Sono in staking e nessuno le tocca. Non faccio nessuna conversione in fiat delle ricompense. Mi sembra assurdo dover pagare tasse come se avessi guadagnato soldi basandomi sul valore attuale di un token che domani, nel momento in cui converto in fiat potrebbe valere zero."

👜 The Ultimate Guide: Why Replica Sellers Are Turning to Crypto Payments in 2024 🔒💳,HighRiskPaymentPro,1i9c1v5,2025-01-24 20:44:08,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighRiskPaymentPro/comments/1i9c1v5/the_ultimate_guide_why_replica_sellers_are/,repg0ddotcom,Replica ,"Running a replica business? In 2024, crypto payments are becoming the go-to solution for sellers in high-risk industries like yours. 

Why? Because traditional payment gateways just can’t keep up.

The Problem with Traditional Payment Processors

❌ High fees that eat into your profits.

❌ Constant risk of account bans and frozen funds.

❌ Long payout times that disrupt cash flow.

❌ Chargebacks that drain your revenue.

For replica sellers, these hurdles make running a smooth business nearly impossible.

Why Crypto Payments Are the Best Solution for Replica Sellers

1️⃣ Instant Transactions
Say goodbye to waiting days (or weeks) to access your earnings. Crypto payments are processed instantly, giving you immediate control over your funds.




2️⃣ No Chargebacks
Chargebacks are a nightmare for replica sellers, but crypto eliminates this issue entirely. Transactions are irreversible, protecting your revenue from disputes.


3️⃣ Privacy and Security
Crypto payments are discreet. You can accept payments securely without worrying about exposure to financial institutions that blacklist replica sellers.


4️⃣ Global Accessibility
Whether your customers are in Europe, Asia, or the U.S., crypto allows you to accept payments from anywhere in the world—no restrictions.


How to Get Started with Crypto Payments for Your Replica Business

	1.	Choose a reliable fiat-to-crypto payment gateway. Look for one with:

	•	Instant payouts in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDC 💸

	•	Low transaction fees 🔑

	•	No lengthy verification processes 🔒

    2.	Integrate the gateway into your website to provide customers with a seamless checkout experience.

	3.	Educate your customers. Many buyers are new to crypto, so offering tutorials or guides on using crypto wallets can improve conversions.

Final Thoughts

In the replica industry, staying ahead means adapting to smarter payment solutions. Crypto payments solve the biggest challenges replica sellers face, allowing you to focus on growing your business.

What do yall use to trade crypto. 

I use coinbase 

Coinbase wallet 

Phantom wallet 

I purchased $10k of SPX6900
Sold at $22,500. 

After selling/swapped I only received $19,500 USDC

There was a coinbase fee of $225 
Slippage fee 
Etherum gas fee 

Somehow it ended being a lot more than expected. 

I was trying to sell at the top
Then buy low

Rinse n repeat. 

 Please help. With advice seems like it’s best to long term hodl. With all the fees. 

This was all done using 
Coinbase to buy etherum. Then sent to my coinbase wallet. Purchased SPX. Then swapped to USDC. I am located in the USA. 
Is this just how crypto is. An enormous fee. Or am I just using the wrong wallet. 
For example. I trade on Webull with stocks. Mostly long term holder. But when I sell there is no 1% fee. Then gas fee. Then slippage fee. 

Please help. Or DM. It does not matter. 
Thank you very much. 

I am looking to buy memes. Then sell when they pump. Then re invest at the dip. 
For example. SPX6900 is an amazing meme coin. That has a great resistance levels. Pumps. Then consolidates at resistance. Then pumps again. But due to the fees. I’m not making money at all. If I am. It’s not much. 

Thank You Again, Community. "

As a data submitter, you will use the mobile network to submit data on a platform, They explain why with, this helps the company.

The company will provide a platform for us to register and complete tasks. If you work 30 days you will receive thousands of dollars ($3000-$5000) apart from everyday commissions of 0.5%-2% on every submission. You will also get money for just logging on each and every day.

They will train you how to do it and walk you through each step of depositing working and withdrawing the funds.

Explains there is a certain amount of data to be completed with the promise of immediate withdrawal. It will start with a small deposit from you in order to complete the data and promises you can withdraw it right away. You will get small amounts and be able to withdraw actual $US money to keep you hooked.

In most cases, the victim completes a few “assignments,” and gets paid tiny amounts of cryptocurrency (often [USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/), ETH or USDC). This is meant to build trust before the real scam kicks in. 

Examples: Deposit $30USD and you will be able to withdraw $150 USD

At this point, the victim is offered a “VIP” gig, with promises of a hefty payday. The only catch: They have to put up only a small amount of cash up front.

 

“Data buy in is only $30 US dollars or $89 dollars but it is secure and you will be able to withdraw they entire amount plus your commission after the data is submitted.

 

They continue to promise your money is safe and you need only complete the assignment to get the entire withdrawal amount.

 

They will even invite you to a worker chat where other people on the chat have the same problems with high deposits required to clear. Workers in the chat will tell you how lucky you are and funds are guaranteed just add the money to the platform and you can get your money and the commission back.

Coinbase much cheaper deposit fees if you buy USDc first and then swap it - did You know?,CoinBase,1i99r2f,2025-01-24 18:52:30,0,0.5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1i99r2f/coinbase_much_cheaper_deposit_fees_if_you_buy/,Salty_Chart_7593,,"Hi, guys, I just want to share what I've discovered. I hope it's not obvious obvious.

When I buy ETH directly, I pay 0.99 Eur  + 1% fee  
  
When I buy ETH through USDc I pay  **0,12 Eur + 0.01% fee**.  Then it's 2% to exchange it to ETH on a custodial wallet, but I think it's cheaper to send it to CB wallet. I Have a choice of networks with low fees, so if I want SOL i send USDc to SOL network in my wallet, and change it there. I believe it's also cheaper. It works both ways. If I am withdrawing crypto, I make sure it's USDc first

I hope it's not the obvious true. I am not 100% sure it's such a gamechanger when handling big amounts, it would need to be verified. But If I want to deposit or withdraw 1Eur and change it to some crypto, there is no other way to make it  "

Account limits and recent account shut downs,KrakenSupport,1i99nei,2025-01-24 18:47:38,4,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/comments/1i99nei/account_limits_and_recent_account_shut_downs/,heion83,𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐝 :green-checkmark:,"Hi,

Can you share how it is possible that when people deposit bigger amounts of of usdc or other crypto from their wallet to your platform, that accounts get shut down? I see a lot of these messages and that's not good. It stifles adoption.

Can you clarify if any type of additional information is needed, beforehand, to be able to cash out, either in crypto to your own wallet, or to your bank at a certain bigger amount? 

Given the fact that the bull market is happening people will deposit greater amounts of crypto or withdraw. If your limits have already been set and you're verified, shouldn't you be good to go?

Let's say your limit is set to cash 100.000/day and crypto 500.000/day. Does this mean that when someone would deposit 5000 - 10000 in crypto, from a personal wallet to your platform, and swap to usdc, to have it withdrawn to a personal wallet, or just straight to their bank cause issues? 

If more info is needed beforehand this needs to be clear because you might lose a lot of clients. And I used to hear a lot good thing about Kraken, so I really feel like this matter needs to be addressed.

Perhaps you need a section where you can list verified wallet addresses? I didn't find those in the app? Let's improve Kraken cause you guys were rocking the space before."
Who Is Ross Ulbricht? The Silk Road Founder and Bitcoin Icon Pardoned by Trump,bitfate,1i99gdq,2025-01-24 18:38:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i99gdq/who_is_ross_ulbricht_the_silk_road_founder_and/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨Just IN: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Soar to New Heights in 2025

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of significant growth and innovation. Bitcoin, the pioneer and leader in the crypto market, has surpassed the $2 trillion market cap milestone, solidifying its position as a store of value and digital gold.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is one of the most promising trends of 2025. AI is being widely used to enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of blockchain networks. This synergy is opening up new opportunities in various sectors, including finance, gaming, and digital services.

Ethereum continues to make strides, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with its innovative Layer 2 scaling solutions and energy-efficient protocols. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC have become central to global trading and DeFi applications, offering stability and compatibility with traditional payment systems.

The gaming industry is also embracing cryptocurrencies and NFT technology, creating new types of gaming experiences such as Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. These games combine entertainment with economic opportunities, attracting both players and investors.

Regulatory clarity is another key factor driving the growth of cryptocurrencies. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCa) regulation and the U.S.'s more positive stance towards cryptocurrencies are providing much-needed legal certainty and protection for investors. This regulatory framework is expected to foster more sustainable growth in the crypto market.

Solana, known for its speed, and other cryptocurrencies like XRP, designed for fast international money transfers, are also gaining traction. The total value locked in Bitcoin-based DeFi is expected to nearly double to over $100 billion in 2025, fueled by the rise of new staking mechanisms.

As we look ahead, predictions for Bitcoin's price are optimistic, with some analysts forecasting it could reach $150,000 to $170,000 by the end of the year. The combination of technological advancements, regulatory clarity, and increasing institutional adoption is setting the stage for a transformative year in the cryptocurrency market.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bullish Bitcoin Adoption Could Push Price to $700K,bitfate,1i96quh,2025-01-24 16:38:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i96quh/blackrock_ceo_larry_fink_says_bullish_bitcoin/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨Just IN: BlackRock CEO Predicts BTC Price Surge with Increased Adoption

In a significant development that could send ripples through the cryptocurrency market, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has hinted that the continued adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) could drive its price to multiples of its current value. This optimistic outlook comes as BlackRock and other financial giants are gearing up for the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The approval of these ETFs is seen as a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, as it would significantly expand access to BTC for institutional investors. According to industry insiders, the launch of these ETFs could have a legitimizing effect on BTC, similar to what was observed with gold ETFs in the past. This could lead to a substantial increase in demand, driving the price of BTC upward.

The integration of BTC into mainstream financial portfolios is also expected to grow, with many financial advisors considering allocations of between 1% to 5% of their clients' portfolios to BTC. While this may seem like a small percentage, it represents a massive amount of capital given the scale of institutional investment.

In addition to the ETF news, the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant trends in 2025. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology is becoming increasingly prominent, with AI agents expected to play a crucial role in maximizing yield and driving engagement in DeFi projects. Ethereum (ETH) continues to innovate with its Layer 2 scaling solutions and energy-efficient protocols, while stablecoins like USDT and USDC are gaining traction in global trading and decentralized finance.

The gaming industry is also embracing cryptocurrencies, with Play-to-Earn (P2E) games and NFT technology creating new economic opportunities for players. Solana (SOL) is emerging as a popular platform for new projects and meme coins, and XRP is gaining ground in facilitating international money transfers.

As the cryptocurrency market expands into new sectors such as gaming, finance, and digital services, 2025 is shaping up to be a year of significant growth and innovation.

Update: I now see that my subscription had been canceled because of a debit card change.

Still though….

Edit: Some of these comments are just outright stupid. Most of you are spewing garbage out of your mouth that doesn’t even apply to my situation. Just keep it to yourself.

Update: For those saying that they don’t pay anything to buy USDC with US dollars. There is a $10,000 per month limit, then it will start charging you a fee, unless you’re in the second tier CB One membership, which is almost $300 a month. No thanks."

The largest on-chain sports betting app now has gasless bridge with Polygon,polygonnetwork,1i94vn3,2025-01-24 15:17:43,12,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/polygonnetwork/comments/1i94vn3/the_largest_onchain_sports_betting_app_now_has/,ballsjumpman,,"[News](https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%22)

Noticed that SX Bet (on-chain sports betting platform doing around $20m in monthly bets) has added a new bridging solution called Glide that offers gasless bridging between SX Network and Polygon. SX Network is SX Bet’s L2 Rollup. It’s a pretty sweet integration, essentially allows users to:

* Bridge a wide selection of different tokens on Polygon (as well as ETH, Arb, base, and OP) and receive equivalent USDC on SX Network, gas-free and no fees, instantly
* Withdraw USDC on SX Network back to Polygon instantly, to any destination address. Super low fees.

Definitely worth checking out if you’re a sports bettor. IMO this new integration puts their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with, if not superior to Rollbit/Stake. Especially so when you consider that it's non-custodial, so you’re able to transact and deposit or withdraw as you please without fear of funds being held.

I’ve been a user of decentralized betting apps for the self-custody, transparency and better odds aspects for a while now, but the UX historically was a bit cumbersome if you’re weren't accustomed to web3. This should make it exponentially easier for anyone to use. 

Here are my bets for the weekend if you want to check it out and tail me!

I saw SX Bet now has an on-ramp integration to fund your wallet with USDC on SX Network (SX Bet’s L2 Rollup) directly from your Coinbase account (through Glide). SX is the largest decentralized sports betting platform, handling around $20m/month in bets. Mainly known for its super tight lines and great odds.

If you have some USD or ETH in your Coinbase account, you can connect to it and fund your hot wallet with USDC on SX Network to start betting right away. No need to go through the tiresome process of making sure you're sending to the right address, correct token, on the correct network etc.

You can also withdraw straight to your Coinbase account on Base (with a minuscule fee, but no gas funds needed). 

Definitely worth checking out if you’re a sports bettor. IMO this new integration makes their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with if not superior to Rollbit/Stake.

Price seems to be really struggling to go upwards, i think a downside is really likely soon. 

With so many shorts coming in, market sentiment is bearish. I guess the reaction in price after the news really was a big let down for people. Now everyones kinda scratching their heads wondering whats next.
