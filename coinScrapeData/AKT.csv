I'm relatively new to this project and I have a few questions I would like to get answer to. Please note that I am not attempting the spread any FUD or cause concern; I'm just trying to learn and understand the project better. Thanks in advance!

1. How does Akash plan to compete with entrenched giants like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft, especially as the blockchain-based cloud computing space remains relatively niche?
2. How does Akash ensure uptime and service reliability in a decentralized network, and what recourse does a user have in case of downtime or service issues?
3. What steps is Akash taking to ensure the security of data hosted on its decentralized network, and has it had any significant breaches or vulnerabilities in the past?
4. Given the fluctuating value of AKT, how can Akash ensure the long-term utility of its token for cloud services, and how does it mitigate volatility risks for users?
5. What’s Akash’s strategy to scale its infrastructure and attract major enterprises or customers away from centralized cloud providers?
6. How does Akash plan to address regulatory concerns in key markets as cloud services become more heavily scrutinized by governments?"

"DePin Case Studies - Geodnet, Helium, Akash",GeodNet,1i2im01,2025-01-16 01:13:45,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeodNet/comments/1i2im01/depin_case_studies_geodnet_helium_akash/,snowbounicorn,,"Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks or DePin for short, is the integration between blockchain and infrastructure networks. DePin currently exists in industries like energy, telecoms, storage, AI, and data collection.

During the last crypto cycle, many projects rode the DePin hype by identifying problems that had large market opportunities but turned to crypto tokenomics when the core product failed to gain traction, in either demand and supply.

However, to those that survived, many companies took the time to build out their infrastructure, to the point where many generate sustainable revenues by solving existing problems, even independent of tokenomic flywheels. Let’s go through some of them!

# [Geodnet](https://geodnet.com/) (real-time kinematics)

# Core Problem Being Solved

Traditional GPS systems often lack the precision required for advanced applications which demand centimeter-level accuracy rather than meter-level precision. Geodnet’s solution improves positioning accuracy by up to 100x compared to conventional GPS technologies.

# Target Customers

Geodnet serves industries that depend on high-precision geospatial data, including:

\- Autonomous Vehicles

\- Agriculture

\- Smart Cities

\- Defense and Security

\- Space Exploration

# Revenue Model

\- Data Licensing: Selling geospatial data to commercial clients.

\- Node Participation Fees: Fees associated with miner installations and usage.

\- Partnerships: Collaborating with industries such as agriculture and autonomous systems to integrate Geodnet services into existing workflows.

In 2024, Geodnet reported revenue growth of over 500% YoY, reaching $1.7M with a run-rate exceeding $2.2M by the end of the year

# Tokenomics

Geodnet uses its native GEOD token to incentivize participants:

\- Miners earn tokens based on data contribution and network uptime.

\- Burn Mechanism: Tokens are burned during data transactions, adding deflationary pressure.

\- Daily Earnings: Average daily earnings per miner are approximately $4.30, with an estimated payback period of 3-4 months.

\- Circulation: Tokens are distributed to ensure liquidity while incentivizing early adopters.

\- Token Utility: Used for payments, staking, and governance within the network.

# Participation and Contribution

1. Becoming a Miner:

\- Purchase a [miner device](https://hyfix.ai/products/mobilecm-triple-band-gnss-base-station) (cost ranges from $500–$700).

New coins to add..,newtonco,1hkvf5t,2024-12-23 14:32:37,2,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtonco/comments/1hkvf5t/new_coins_to_add/,Savings-Albatross-19,,"I know Newton is working on adding more tokens, Ondo and ENA are signs that you're adding both quality and promising projects.

But here is my wishlist for the near future...

TAO - thee most important add I can think of even though it wouldn't be my personal top choice for my own bag.  But a good onramp for Canadians to easily get TAO.

Kaspa - even though I see some real potential issues with it's emmission rate/price potentially risking losing miners if the price doesn't increase soon.  The tech is solid and the community is insane, so its a no brainer it needs to be added.

Kadena - a longer-term investment play that will survice beyond this cycle and should be a safer bet with good long-term upside.

Ather -  probably  better tech than Render, might not catch the same demand level but its quality will attract more enterprise level clients.  Could be interesting if an AI agent project uses Ather as its backbone.  Either way you need a second GPU distribution play, or three....

AKT - Akash is another great AI GPU play with additional aspects.  If peoole wrap their minds around what this project offers it might expode.  GPU distribution is big now but if chip supply gets better GPU rental business might diminish so a project with addition use could be a beter investment choice.

SEI, TON, VET, SFUND, AR, BEAM, SUPER, IMX, FET, CETUS, AERO, VELODROME, W (wormhole) are all projects that should be considered... and I think all should be added.  

The sooner you get these added the better to allow your customers an opportunity to get in as early as possible.  As a more experienced user I can track down these projects and add them to my portfolio.  Still I like buying right from my bank account and if the project is native to Newton there's an even higher chance Ill add to my bag using Newton.  I do not know all of the criteria necessary to pass the bar and get added but I hope we see many of these get added ASAP.

Liquidity Pool Advice,OsmosisLab,1h4jeyx,2024-12-01 20:32:33,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OsmosisLab/comments/1h4jeyx/liquidity_pool_advice/,DespyHasNiceCans,Ecosystem :osmo:,"
So I'm contemplating joining the Akash/USDC pool and while IL scares me, I know it's lessened with half the pair being stable. I have faith in Akash being a strong performer over time especially after looking at its chart over the year which means I know I won't get the full gains it could achieve, but I believe the APY could outpace the gains. 
Playing with an APY calculator, the value of my investment should double over 3 months which I believe AKT could achieve on its own, but any time over that is where the pool will shine. The value should go up another 100% every month after that when compounding daily. 
So I know factors like a market crash could effect things and I know APYs possibly fall over time, so my plan isn't guaranteed, but I'd like to know everyone's advice concerning this. Is a pool worth it? I love the fact that the pool has no lock-in period so I can jump whenever I want but I plan on being in it for at least six months and constantly readjusting the range due to market conditions. What y'all think, anything I'm overlooking?"

Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Coins of the Third Week of November 2024,Blockmandev,1gy1xwn,2024-11-23 10:20:06,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1gy1xwn/top_3_artificial_intelligence_ai_coins_of_the/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: The AI narrative is taking over the crypto market, and three standout coins are leading the charge this week—TFUEL, ZIG, and AKT. Let’s break it down.  

TFUEL, the operational token of the Theta Network, has seen an 18% surge over the past week, bringing its market cap close to $500 million. While still far from its 2021 all-time high, the recent rally highlights its potential for a comeback. Eyes are on the next resistance levels at $0.080 and $0.1, but if momentum dies down, it could test support around $0.054.

ZIG, from the Zignaly platform, is embracing AI for crypto copy trading, which has fueled a 15% rally in the last seven days. With a $200 million market cap and growing interest, ZIG is nearing its all-time high of $0.19. A continued uptrend might push it there, but losing its support at $0.127 could drag it down to $0.081.

Then there’s AKT, the AI-powered token from Akash Network, disrupting decentralized cloud computing. Up 22% this week, AKT is knocking on the door of a $1 billion market cap. With resistance at $4.71 and potential to blast past $5, market watchers are intrigued. However, failing to maintain its momentum could send AKT stumbling to $2.43.

The fusion of AI and crypto is trending hard, and these projects show just how transformative this combo might be. #CryptoTrends #AIinCrypto #Blockchain"

In October, analysts at **Lookonchain** accused him of insider trading on the token. They analyzed the activity of a wallet that Bouhanna previously identified as his own. The experts noted that he had been unsuccessfully trading various memecoins for some time before launching his own. According to their calculations, as **BAN's** price surged, Bouhanna started selling his own tokens, earning at least **$1 million**.

Shortly before BAN’s listing on Binance, Bouhanna posted on **X** (formerly Twitter), denying involvement in those BAN sales. He insists that he created the token “without intending to attract attention” but shared the link with “a group of friends” during its launch.

After the Binance listing announcement, the **BAN** token price suddenly doubled, only to drop back just as quickly.

This article delves into promising altcoins, including Mande Network, Akash Network, Osmosis, Celestia, Stellar, Cosmos (ATOM), SAGA, Solana, CUDOS, and Nolus, while addressing the limitations of DeFi and DePIN and emphasizing the lasting impact of blockchain technology.

# The Limitations of DeFi and DePIN

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) have gained traction as revolutionary concepts. However, their scalability and sustainability are often called into question. According to a report by Chainalysis, over $1 billion was lost to DeFi hacks in 2022, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in these ecosystems.

The lack of robust service level agreements (SLAs) in DeFi protocols can lead to unreliable performance, while the decentralized nature makes accountability a challenge. Without clear liability, these platforms risk undermining user trust and operational integrity.

# The Enduring Appeal of Crypto Technology

Despite the challenges facing DeFi and DePIN, the fundamental technology of blockchain remains promising. According to a report by McKinsey, the global blockchain market could reach $1.4 trillion by 2030. The potential for transparency, security, and decentralization can revolutionize sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, driving the industry towards more sustainable and practical applications.

# Tokenization: Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3

Tokenization represents a vital step in merging traditional finance (Web2) with blockchain innovations (Web3). By creating digital tokens for real-world assets — such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property — new markets can emerge, increasing efficiency and transparency.

One of the most promising applications is in credit scoring. Traditional credit scoring methods often exclude underserved populations. Blockchain-based credit scoring systems can provide a more comprehensive assessment, fostering financial inclusion.

# Altcoins with Potential: A Closer Look

The upcoming bull run is poised to be influenced by factors such as institutional adoption, favorable regulations, and increasing public interest. Here are several altcoins to watch closely:

Nolus focuses on decentralized applications but has faced stability issues, impacting user trust. The team’s intentions seem genuine, but the platform’s reliability remains questionable. If Nolus can regain user confidence, it could present a 10X opportunity, but this will require significant effort.

# The Limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as industry leaders, but their potential for explosive growth is diminishing. The increasing institutional involvement, including ETFs and derivatives, has shifted these assets into a more regulated and less speculative realm. Analysts predict that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will see a maximum of 5X returns, particularly as regulatory frameworks tighten.

# The Decline of NFTs

NFTs, once the darling of the crypto world, appear to be losing traction. As interest wanes and fatigue sets in, many projects lack the substance needed for long-term viability. The NFT craze, largely driven by speculative hype during the COVID era, has resulted in declining enthusiasm and a search for more meaningful applications of blockchain technology.

# Conclusion

The next bull run in cryptocurrency is poised to be defined by altcoins that offer real-world applications and sustainable business models. Mande Network emerges as a standout opportunity, while other projects like Osmosis, Stellar, and Celestia show promise despite challenges. Investors should approach Bitcoin and Ethereum with caution, as their days of explosive growth seem behind them. As the industry evolves, the focus will likely shift towards practical solutions that bridge Web2 and Web3, paving the way for a more stable and prosperous crypto landscape.

Conduct thorough due diligence, assess the risks, and consider the transformative potential of these emerging technologies as you navigate the next phase of the cryptocurrency market."

Akash only making ~$2000/day in revenue? Or am I missing something ,akashnetwork,1e9njia,2024-07-22 15:49:54,11,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/akashnetwork/comments/1e9njia/akash_only_making_2000day_in_revenue_or_am_i/,jaredj92,🌈 AKT,"
According to Akash website and this tweet, akash is only making around $2000 per day in revenue. 

https://x.com/flowslikeosmo/status/1815039249801953654?s=46

Is this just from transaction fees? Is there another form of revenue as well?

I ask because I am invested in AKT and just looking for transparency.

Customer service is telling me that I need to sync Metamask to the backend of AscendEX, and to do this I must transfer ETH (half the value of the AKT amount) onto Metamask then swap it to Akash, before I can retrieve AKT from my account.

Does this sound right please?? I've never had to buy one crypto to retrieve another crypto before."

Akash (AKT) is another gainer in today’s session, as seen from its price movements. An in-depth analysis shows that Akash Network has shown a significant recent uptick in its last candle. However, the trend is generally bearish, as the price trading below the SuperTrend indicator indicates.

On the other hand, the RSI has spiked to 63, which reflects increasing bullish momentum in the short term and potentially signals a trend reversal or pullback. As of press time, the Akash price stood at $4.43, representing a 5.9% jump from its previous 24-hour price.
