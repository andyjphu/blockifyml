I want more videos of people fucking around. I wish I'd see it or hear it in the background of more videos like with my other favorite game risk of rain. I think it'll be incredibly fun to see 2 people fuck around in remnant in a semi playthrough. I like iron pineapple and Russian badger videos on the game, but they kinda cut through a lot and jump from world to world. Im partially tempted to try and make the content my self"
Do you let family parties take over your personal life?,FilipinoAmericans,1i9wo84,2025-01-25 15:49:48,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoAmericans/comments/1i9wo84/do_you_let_family_parties_take_over_your_personal/,SweetieK1515,,"Husband and I have adopted some Filipino traits- respect, family but we’ve also rejected some of the toxic cultural traits. His family is a giant cult, not friendly and exclusive. It seems the women (aunties, daughters, sisters, elders) benefit more. There’s also a personality clash where they’re constantly gossiping, talking bad about others/judging or finding some sort of power trip to control my husband. I’m generally private but give enough info where I can still be on an info diet. They don’t know how to have conversations and it’s just this entitlement and interrogation. Sometimes they pretend to be extra nice when they just want gossip, extra heads to attend their parties, or a gift. Other than that, they don’t care and rarely reciprocate. It’s just a lot of drama and negativity with too many cooks in the kitchen. 

The parents should be proud of us. We’re not nurses but work in management that is lucrative. We attend parties when we can (once a month) but even then, it’s not enough. And the invites are so last minute, I don’t have time to mentally prepare or get a gift. It’s 2 days of the week where I can focus on other responsibilities or ourselves. I notice my husband used to be on cruise control mode and just attend without thinking, even if he’s tired from the week. I told him that we have our own house, we don’t depend on anyone financially, and not kids anymore where we have to do things out of obligation for everything. We have a choice. It doesn’t help that we’ve been trying to have kids and it’s been successful. There’s an emotional aspect to it as well without having to badgered by aunties and uncles who think they’re doctors and tell me why I can’t have a baby. They tend to blame me, even though I’m the healthier one with good labs. My husband is obese with low sperm count. Anyhoo, you would think they would be proud bc we’re independent but it seems they hate that they can’t control us, like family party attendance. 

How do you balance this?"

At this point, I can't get sound from the speakers or headphones (either wired or wireless). The drivers are all up to date, but when I run the troubleshooter, it says they aren't. But then the troubleshooter can't do an update. I've gotten this message, too: 0x8889000F (can't find audio playback device).

Malwarebytes says there's nothing bad on the system. I put Privacy Badger on Firefox and on Edge a few days ago and removed them, but that didn't help.

It looks like other people are having this problem too. Any ideas? What I really need it for is Teams/Zoom.

Selling my practically new Vortex scopes.  Both come with boxes, paperwork, and mounted.  I will consider parting scopes and mounts if they don't sell together - if so I will relist so please no dibs on mounts or scopes only.

**~~Vortex Razor HD Gen II-E 1-6x24~~** **~~VMR-2 (MRAD)~~** ~~on a~~ **~~Badger C1 1.7"" Mount~~** ~~- purchased the scope about a month ago, the mount is a C&R from here.  Scope was mounted and zeroed (\~10 rounds) and has sat in my safe since.  Glass is perfect, body is perfect, comes with everything you'd get in the box.  Looking for $1200 shipped + insured.~~  **Badger mount only for $250**

**Vortex Venom 3-15x44 EBR-7C (MOA)** on a **Vortex Pro Extended Mount** \- Same story, perfect condition and comes with everything in the box.  Great scope but don't have a place to shoot past 100 yards so it just sits in my safe.  Asking ~~$350~~ $325 shipped + insured.

Will accept Paypal FF & Venmo.  Dibs takes it,  Lowball offers will be flat-out ignored.  I'll ship out same or next day."

Find exploits in my homebrew races before my players do!,dndnext,1i9sbb1,2025-01-25 12:39:26,3,0.64,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/1i9sbb1/find_exploits_in_my_homebrew_races_before_my/,DukeDens007,Homebrew,"Alright, one or two of you may have seen this doc before-  I’ve been kinda badgering strangers for advice and suggestions before I send it to the friends I’m playing with- but this will prooobably be the last time I bother Reddit with this. Also this is like 40 pages… just lost all of ya, but obviously I don’t really expect anyone to read through allll of this, just skip around to the pictures ya like and skim if ya want (unless they like reading dense homebrew shi 😬)

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPHZ7iCKv1j21SawGD9Q55idae3SboY2Q7jDNdKUtpc/edit

I’m about to run a pretty homebrew campaign set in a fantasy worldbuilding project I’ve been working on for around 6 years- the issue is, I only started getting into DnD about a year ago, so nothing on my continent of “Dracon” has anything to do with DnD, although I’ve been told several times that it’s basically Faerun or Eberron, but with different fantasy creatures and lore.

I’ve spent the last couple months trying to translate the 21 Draconin species into at least somewhat playable DnD races, and implementing a slightly tweaked background system called *Regional Backgrounds*-  having players choose from one of 7 regions in Dracon, each one granting advantage on CHA checks and some other skill checks while in your chosen region, giving a wider array of proficiency options to design your backstory (basically combing multiple backgrounds into a single region, based off it’s most common professions of lifestyles), and giving 1 unique feature for each region (as if a learned skill from growing up/spending a lot of time/studying there).

There are also *Elite Species* who I will happily take suggestions on how to balance. They’re a list of 7 Draconin species who I feel need to include because the PCs will see them pretty frequently, sometimes just casually living in settlements (also I just think they’re pretty cool…), but I have no clue how to balance them without completely rewriting their lore. What I’ve landed on is simply not allowing them to take a *Regional Background* and only taking a +1 ASI at character creation, instead of the standard +1 +1 +1 or +1 +2 ASI. Again, willing to take suggestions.

Doubt I’ll get many replies (seriously just tell me “this feature sucks”, that’s good advice!) but I figured I’d throw this out into the ether one more time and hopefully find some things I missed that may completely break the game. These species ARE meant to be slightly stronger than typical DnD races, their extra spells and proficiencies are there on purpose. And I did try and get creative with the wording of some things in order to not contradict class features, but idk if the wording used give way for gamebreaking exploits.

So… if you’re really bored and wanna give yourself a headache, try and find something that will COMPLETELY (not just something that’s just a bit stronger) ruin the game, or just give me some suggestions but I figure that first one is more fun, I personally love just making DnD characters in my free time. Pick your favorite OFFICIAL DnD class, then choose a species or elite species, then pick a *Regional Background* if you’re not an elite species, and tell me how completely busted your dude is. Bonus points if you actually have some suggestions to change things. Any way, yeah, bring on the downvotes for my crazy unbalanced homebrew 🤘

Edit- might help, I’m starting us off at either level 5 or 7- reasons for maybe starting at level 7 are weird but there are reasons lol"

Naruto's Desire to become Hokage is centered on his Desire for a family... Literally,NarutoFanfiction,1i9j6vr,2025-01-25 04:12:33,24,0.96,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/1i9j6vr/narutos_desire_to_become_hokage_is_centered_on/,KidCoheed,Fic Request,"In Ninja Villages the majority of the power is centered on and based around The Kage, unfortunately for all Kage and any one that lives at all with a position of legal power in the Elemental Nations, that Power comes from your Regions Daimyo. Unfortunately for Hiruzen Sarutobi and Naruto Uzumaki all plans to hide the Poor Orphan Jinchuuriki in the anonymity of civilianhood at least until the boy can become a Ninja come to bite them in the ass when the Civilian Council put in place to check the power of the Hokage by the Daimyo come to the leader of their nation with request. While Harsh, the Daimyo feels they would not make these requests without need and so he puts Ink to paper and signed the decrees. No he doesn't know the one he is placing these sentences on were a 7 year old boy who was the child to his last Hokage and the Woman who saved his life from assassin's leading him to create his 12 Guardian Ninja Squadron. Not that he would even listen to the argument, his Council had spoken. It would take and act of God to change his mind... Or proof Naruto Uzumaki deserved his dream of a family. 

Decree 1 - No Wedding Ceremony done by a Land of Fire Representative or Church Recognized by the Land of Fire shall be done including the Party Recognized as Naruto Uzumaki of Konoha

Decree 2 - No Family or Clan that Houses Naruto Uzumaki of Konoha shall be allowed any other children under the age of 18 years of age for the protection of the children 

Decree 3 - Any Attempt to Break or Circumvent Decrees Regarding Naruto Uzumaki of Konoha will result in immediate banishment from the Land of Fire for no less than 30 years and forfeiture of all holdings of Family or Clan

Basically Naruto looses all hope of a girlfriend, a wife, children and even being adopted all in one day. Kicked from the Orphanage he had called home since birth Naruto sets himself the goal of becoming Hokage. If he could do that he could prove he was a good person, a person worth overturning the Decrees.

Why these Decrees, well by denying a Church recognized in The Land of Fire or Someone who had connections to the Daimyo Naruto can't legally get married in his home and if he was to become a Ninja (which is his duty as Jinchuuriki) he would HAVE to have his marriage recognized by one or both of those places. Now why not just have a live in girlfriend? That would be seen as Circumventing the Decrees leading to banishment for the woman who loves him. Decree 2 prevents him from getting someone pregnant and sharing custody even one night would violate the rules. It's also the rule preventing him from living in the orphanage and even from being adopted as any one who adopts him puts their entire family and clan at risk of losing their assets. No one will raise him if the Civilian Council decide ""Family or Clan"" includes distant relatives.

And so Hiruzen sets up the stipend and moves Naruto into an apartment building (which leads to the mass exodus of families to prevent being even tangential subject to the Decrees) and despite his Constant badgering of the Daimyo who won't budge he can't reveal Naruto's heritage out of fear the same man would brag about it, putting Konoha at risk from Cloud and Rock. Stuck between failing Kushina, Minato, Naruto and their former Allies The Uzumaki and Getting Banished, losing everything him and his family had built and even risking Konoha's Stewardship as a Accepted Ninja Village should he retaliate against the Council, Hiruzen has one thing left to do... Build Naruto into a Hokage Worthy Ninja.

This does have influence on the personal and action parts of the story as Naruto knows any crush he has is worthless until he gets the laws over turned and thus is a bit of a sad sap when it comes to relationships, cutting of Hinata when he discovers her crush, stamping down any feelings he has/had for Sakura and the like. How Others particularly Ninja interact with him would change, they may not understand his status but to be singled out by the Daimyo tones down the hate. How Naruto interacts with others is changed as he is unable to hang out for ""To Long"" with others putting them at risk for Decree Circumventing Charges, he can't sleep over at any friends house or even have them sleep at his, even how he interacts with them is hampered by the fear of others ""Looking to deep"" and calling a false Violation.

So can Naruto become Hokage and talk the Daimyo into changing the rules or will he be forced to do something drastic?

My idea is basically Naruto/Girl or even Naruto/Harem as it becomes a melancholy romance action story until Naruto gets the OK. Naruto sleeping away from his teammates outside on missions to avoid even putting their families at risk due to insane assholes not even staying in their tents"

Not exactly in the boonies, I can see my neighbors, but I only have 2 close to my house. We have big 3-5 acre lots. Im a single middle aged female and most of my neighbors are older; I think there's one couple on my street who's like 10 years older than me. 

 I wanted a cattle dog because I wanted a dog that was wary of strangers but not necessarily AGGRESSIVE, and I already have one long haired dog so a GSD or similar was out of the question.

So one of my neighbors is friendly, so I try to avoid him and his wife as much as possible. I just hate getting sucked in to chitchat. Well these past few days he's been knocking on my door (I work from home during the day, mind you) and the other day he asked for a hug. Then he texts me (we all have each others numbers on the street) that ""I give great hugs"". So today he comes knocking on my door at like 10AM and I lie and say I'm in a meeting. Later the afternoon I'm out with the dogs and he comes walking over again. 

Badger is not a fan. A little bit of barking, but mostly just hackles up giving him the eye. He literally gets on my front stoop and stands in front of my door and looks at him like ""try it asshole"". Then again with the hugs....Badger comes in sniffing so I say (not really a lie) he doesn't like men so maybe don't hug too long. 

We'll see if he drops by as frequently now. I'm a little disappointed he didn't run at him from across the property like a freight train, but I'll take what I can get.

Now if I could just get Badger to leave the cat alone, I could leave him out of his crate overnight....."

In-laws making my limbo worse,NIPT,1i9b9g9,2025-01-24 20:04:35,7,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NIPT/comments/1i9b9g9/inlaws_making_my_limbo_worse/,CommonPotential2008,,"After getting an atypical result for chromosome 18 on NIPT, I had my amnio last week. FISH results were good, but the doctor was clear that it doesn't mean we're out of the woods and still need to wait a couple more weeks for the karotype & microarray. I'm trying to not think about it too much, but my in-laws are freaking out and constantly asking for updates on the tests even though we told them it would be weeks. I know they are well intended, but it really feels like they aren't thinking about how to support us and are making it about them instead. I've already been annoyed with them because they expect a full debrief on every one of my dr appointments, and badger me constantly about having HG. I feel like all the effort I'm putting in to mentally handle this challenging is getting totally undone by them. I mostly just need to vent, but am curious whether anyone dealt with difficult family during their limbo. "

Analyzing every single player on the Rip City Remix,RipCityRemix,1i9ago0,2025-01-24 19:26:12,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RipCityRemix/comments/1i9ago0/analyzing_every_single_player_on_the_rip_city/,Admirable-Speech-308,,"While I was working on this thread already did like 5 players and the whole thread reset so apologies if it isn’t as good 😞

The Remix only current G League draftee they still have this season is a 25-year-old Sterling Manley who played college at UNC before stops in China, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, speaking of the Dominican Republic I’d like to quote a fascinating article I saw Blazers Edge post on Justin Minaya and the other 2 two way players, this post I’m making here is only highlighting non Two Ways but here’s the article if you wanna read it: [https://www.blazersedge.com/2025/1/4/24332536/portland-trail-blazers-rip-city-remix-g-league-bryce-mcgowens-taze-moore-justin-minaya-rotation](https://www.blazersedge.com/2025/1/4/24332536/portland-trail-blazers-rip-city-remix-g-league-bryce-mcgowens-taze-moore-justin-minaya-rotation)

Now we begin:

I had actually never heard of Estonia before Henri Drell existed, he’s currently averaging 20.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals for the Remix this season, the 6 ft 9 guard is apparently also the second Estonian player to ever play (I didn’t even know there was a first, it’s Martin Muursepp who was drafted as the 25th pick in the 1996 draft and averaged a career 4.7 points) what’s cool is that Henri has played in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls who signed him to a two way contract last season, but this season he has joined Rip City and would be cool to see him getting called up or signed to a two way if any trades happen, his father mother and sister were all basketball players and he’s a certified hooper in his blood

James Bouknight: People forget dude was a lottery pick in the 2021 Draft, wasn’t played much as a rookie but in the 6 games he played over 20 minutes he averaged double digits off efficient shooting every single game from 18 to 24 to 13 several times and in the G League in his rookie season he averaged 21.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.9 steals and a block off efficient shooting, he kinda balanced between hooping similar numbers in the G League and the NBA throughout the rest of his career until this year I don’t wanna stick into controversy but Bouknight was battling poor mental health while with the Hornets especially because of the off court stuff that if you know you know, and I just hope he’s doing better mentally now

https://preview.redd.it/8ydo19ghk0fe1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac2e10578df5bd14b275071fea39c849c4e69c18

Aleem Ford is a 6 ft 8 Puerto Rican hooper who plays the forward and bounced around overseas, the Cavs and the Magic and now finally the Remix, he’s only been off the bench averaging 7.3 points in the Tip Off Tourney but in college Ford started all 31 games for the Badgers, who were a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but the 26 year old averaged much more internationally and in the G and most recently he helped Puerto Rico qualify for the Olympics and when Ford was on the floor Puerto Rico actually led 29-25 after the first quarter before getting blown out against the US and against LeBron and Curry in limited minutes for Ford he had ten points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals Off the bench, he’s shown he can hoop when given the minutes, but now we can only wait and see…

Romeo Weems is averaging a modest 6.4 points & 1.2 steals off 60% from the field in 17 min off the bench after playing a couple seasons for the Grizzlies in the G League and in the Summer League and even appeared in 2 preseason games, coming off a **Big East All-Rookie Team** for DePaul he went straight to Memphis and then was picked by Rip City in the expansion draft, so technically he’s an OG Rip City Remix.

Seattle fans and Portland fans have forever been interlinked as most Portland fans I know follow the Seahawks and a few Seattle people I know who are upset over the SuperSonics leaving follow the Blazers and not OKC which is interesting to me but makes sense because of how close the cities are, and Cameron Tyson who I love most about him is his beard lol but he was a Seattle HOOPER, I can go thru his whole career with SU but I just want to go thru last season I mean he was the 2024 College Basketball Invitational tournament MVP, a NABC First Team All-District, First Team All-WAC and the man started every game he played to lead SU in scoring and minutes played, second ranked scorer in the WAC and 83rd in the nation, and his last game in college was a loud 30-point bomb in the the championship game of the CBI his 117 made threes last season was the second most for a single season at Seattle U ranking No. 1 in the WAC and third in the nation in just a little 2-3 year stretch he became just the second player ever to don a Seattle U jersey to surpass 2,000 career points, I can go on for hours about the Seattle U Athlete of the Year but we have to talk about how he’s been doing in the G League and he’s been averaging little minutes but off the bench in the G League Tip Off Tourney he came up in the clutch averaging 10.4 points off 43/44/88 splits and as a starter he averaged 12.3 points off 43/43/100 splits and also grabbing 5.5 rebounds a game, he’s just a pure hooper watch these college highlights and come back to me and can’t wait to see what he can do the rest of the season [https://youtu.be/qyPWhifM19M?si=BGxr85DPIAmA\_bSj](https://youtu.be/qyPWhifM19M?si=BGxr85DPIAmA_bSj)

[His beard looked better on SU](https://preview.redd.it/nn7fpvx4o0fe1.jpg?width=408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31d5dcfd38d4c9106f351bcbcbf04a9219c65325)

Now say that 10 more times, 8.5 points and 7.5 rebounds and 2 blocks per game and 63% from the field and 50% from 3 in the G Leagye tourney AND AND AND yada yada, as a fucking SEVEN FOOTER, I wanna see this dude and Clingan on the same floor that would just be hilarious, the Ukrainian had a 2 way with the Knicks but glad we have him now, and so glad he isn’t Russian (I’m just joking, I come from a Russian background)

[This is an actual photo of him](https://preview.redd.it/uiqukgg6p0fe1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c377aff4954fbb6f2f68b0c93818fe5cad276bd)

REESE CAN YOU PASS THE CHEESE, we say in unison (or maybe we don’t) but maybe instead we should say FUCK OKC for waiving my guy after only playing him one game, my guy was a HOOPER in Alabama but sadly went undrafted and ended up working at a mf bar, your Rip City Remix legend was also a Bartending legend as well, (MyCareer Ah Storyline) I bet he switched tables at the bar as well as he hooped but eventually RIP CITY came calling as they always do and he played for them last season as well as securing him to play for Portland in the 2024 NBA Summer League and now this season he’s averaging 8 more points in the Tip Off Tourney than last season and starting the season as an OKC Thunder he came right back home and starting the regular season he’s averaging 18.8 points off 46/35/90 splits with a whopping 7.5 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.9 blocks as a 6 ft 9 forward, I think he deserves a 2 way somewhere for sure considering he had a non 2 way contract in his hands just a bit ago

[He didn’t pass the cheese 😔 ](https://preview.redd.it/xroh3tfwr0fe1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5878f592581f40ec58ae010fe795a8db7311ed9)

|| || |Isaac Nogues Gonzalez (ESP)|6|North Macedonia|FIBA U20 EuroBasket|

This is a graph showing how much steals Isaac Nogues had in just one game this season in the FIBA U20 EuroBasket, the leader of steals in the EuroBasket was Ben Saraf with 8 in a game and then second is Ben Saraf with 7 in a game, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBuK-xxLINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBuK-xxLINE) Isaac broke the steals record for Rip City this season with 10 in a game in the Tip Off Tourney he averaged 4.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.2 steals and in the regular season so far it’s been only 2 steals but 7 rebounds and 4.6 assists, crazy Aura for a role player, and he’s also from Spain so…hell yeah Amigo 🫡

[Jacket is tuff](https://preview.redd.it/2rlfiwm3t0fe1.jpg?width=408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46d7780f414e57113c854890e0d38b8c469b11af)

I think I covered every single non Two Way, wait oh shit saved the best for last, in the Tip Off Tourney Xavier Johnson averaged 10.2 points, 4.2 rebounds a steal and a whopping 8 assists in the fucking G League and you understand how crazy that is as this was in less than 20 min and only 4 players besides for him in the entire G League averaged more than 8 assists, people aren’t pass first players in the G cause everyone’s trying to make it out, the man entered high school at 5'6, but grew six inches by his senior year, and the WCAC Player of the Year, first-team All-State and first-team All-Metro high ranked prospect and ACC All-Freshman select was the first Pitt freshman to lead the team is scoring since 1985 and was the only player in the ACC to average at least 15 points and 4.5 assists per game, he was a top draft prospect but injuries ruined it all, broke his foot in a game against Kansas for Indy on December 17, 2022, forcing him to miss the entire season and forcing him to play another year in college but 2 years before his last year in Indiana he was HOOPING which “he credited his mid-season turnaround to his grandfather's death in early February, along with strong chemistry with fellow teammate Trayce Jackson Davis” I mean He ended that season averaging 12.1 points and 5.1 assists per game off a rocky start and his 172 assists that year were the 5th most in a season in Indiana Hoosiers history, I mean he’s 26 years old now so he’s a really good veteran for rip city and a good asset to this team, a pass first, hard worker, and good story for the young guys

What are some of your highs & lows surveying?,Surveying,1i9a40q,2025-01-24 19:09:30,39,0.93,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surveying/comments/1i9a40q/what_are_some_of_your_highs_lows_surveying/,yossarian19,Discussion,"I'll start:   
  
Low: one time my rod man and I were told by the office not to answer any questions. The neighbors come out and start asking my rod man what's going on. He says he can't answer questions, so they start badgering him and yelling at him. He slips up, yells back, and now it's a total shit-show. I managed to drag him out of there before any felonies were committed but by the end of it, I was seriously worried for the neighbor's 22 year old son. I would not fuck with that rod man.   
  
High: We had to set a monument in asphalt. We were out of railroad spikes - nothing but 3/4"" rebar in the truck. I marked the spot, used a control spike to chip a little divot out of the asphalt and using an engineer's sledge I sunk the rebar through 4"" AC and the base rock. Didn't miss or glance a single blow. I did it well enough that when I finished, I looked up and three crusty old contracters were visibly impressed and one of them told me that it was well done.   
Yes, I really am damn proud of that one rebar I hammered in \~10 years ago. "
Husband racked up $30k in cc debt and didn’t tell me,AskWomenOver30,1i9a0wl,2025-01-24 19:05:21,119,0.92,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1i9a0wl/husband_racked_up_30k_in_cc_debt_and_didnt_tell_me/,jeymouth,Romance/Relationships,"I’m a F, 31. My husband (M, 35)’s been unemployed since June. I knew he was spending on his credit card, and I noticed that he had been making some frivolous purchases, but when I probed him to talk about money he clammed up and got defensive. Eventually, I stopped asking. As of a few months ago I pay for our mortgage and most of our expenses. 

He finally broke down today over the stress of carrying this debt. 

We have a history of infidelity (he cheated on me once years ago, we worked through it but it really did scar me), and this secret of the debt is reallllly triggering for me.

At the same time, I want to support him and be there for him. He’s experiencing a lot of job ennui with the state of the world, he’s applied to many many jobs, and is in a depressive episode. He obviously feels really bad about the debt—it’s emasculating for him. He had some freelance clients that he was going to work for but everything he’s tried thus far has fallen through. 

I have a well paying job and I know we’ll get through it, but I don’t want to condone this behaviour, and once again I feel like this is a major breach of trust.

I don’t feel financially safe in this relationship. 

I’m always the one to make the tough decisions when it comes to money. Just last week he was badgering to me about going to Europe in the spring to see family on points, and I was like, “with what money?”. Knowing that yes we have points and stuff but a trip to Europe would still be a fairly big expense. I’m always the bad guy, the voice of reason, the one who refers to the budget. He spends frivolously to feel something.

 I don’t know what to do to repair this, and whether I as his wife should jump in to help him pay off this debt (knowing as well that being out of debt will be beneficial to our household) or if paying it off myself will be condoning this behaviour and this secrecy that I’ve done everything in my power to intercept. 

Any advice?

"AITA for not ""getting over it""",CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i996s9,2025-01-24 18:26:04,9,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i996s9/aita_for_not_getting_over_it/,No_Succotash4858,AITA,"This will be a long one.  Will add a TLDR at the end. 

For context,  I (44F) have been with my husband (39 M) have been married for over a decade.  We don't have children.  We do have amazing nieces and nephews, though.  We usually have them over for sleepovers, play board games,  cards, etc. I always take care of getting their birthday gifts,  hubby's bday gifts,  everyone else's, christmas presents, etc.

I go out of my way to help my nieces and nephews' parents out if they need help with anything.  It could be driving any of the littles to practices, showing up at all their games,  really just being there.  I make sure everyone gets celebrated for the positives. Really, just try to be a cheerleader for them all (including my husband).

My husband struggles with mental illness, and for about half of our marriage, he would lie,  act like I (and everyone else) was out to get him, and used illicit substances. It was really a 💩 show. I kept telling myself that mental illness (bi-polar, adhd, major depression, and more) is still an illness, and i would not leave him if he had cancer,  so I stayed.  

He finally is on the right meds and is doing somewhat better. So after years of no one celebrating me,  or really even remembering,  I said I wanted to do something this last year for my birthday. 

Husband has never planned anything for my birthday even though I have said, ""It would be nice if we could x on my birthday.""

This last year I decided to stop being suttle (not that I think I was suttle before), and said two months before my birthday I wanted to have a lunch for my birthday with all the littles (they all live in different cities), gave the restaurant I knew would have plenty of room for everyone to my husband. I told him this could be something he could do.  He has the parents' phone numbers so he can call and figure out a date that works for everyone.

For everyone who thinks this is too far in advance,  my nieces and nephews are all in different sports,  parents are heavily involved with them as well.  The only way to make something like this happen is to plan well in advance. 

Two weeks pass, and he has not reached out.  I ask him, and I get,  ""I will do it."" Another week and a half passes without him reaching out. I finally badger him into texting and planning it.  I then asked if he would have ever done it if I didn't make him. His response,  ""I guess we'll never know.""

Then the day of the lunch came,  we head to the restaurant. One of the moms/dads is always on-time if not early.  She is not there.  I asked him if he confirmed with anyone,  well no, because I asked them to come. My heart sank.  I already knew what the day would be.  I had him text that set of parents to see if they were almost there.  And shocker,  they forgot. The others could not be bothered, and we're going to be ""only 30 min late."" 

I told him I was canceling and we went home.  I cried so much.  I had only asked for him to plan a lunch.  I told him that we now knew he would never have planned it if I had not stayed on him.  His response was, ""Oh well sorry."" I am aware that part of it is the parents, but the bigger part was that he just could not take my feelings into account for one thing when I have stood by his side. 

I have not mentioned it again,  but I have also not asked for anything since then.  I just can't seem to get over it, though. 

Edit to add, there were only the 2 families he needed to connect with. They are both blended, so I ended up with bonus littles. But just 2 people.

TLDR wanted husband to plan a bday lunch with nieces and nephews and got nothing. "

What does James The Cat have to do with Tf2?

Absolutely nothing

But I made this anyways 

I added 5/6 main characters (Mrs Lavender is a snail so i think she's probably Miss Pauling if want to add her)

James is Heavy

Frieda is Scout

Rocky is Soldier 

Citoren is spy 

And Dennis is Engineer 

I also added some one off characters that only appear in a few episodes 

Otto is Demoman 

Pa Rat is Sniper 

And The Unnamed dentist Badger is Medic 

Since we don't know anything about pyro, I added a semi-original character that is just as mysterious as pyro

Analyzing every single player on the Rip City Remix,ripcity,1i98kks,2025-01-24 17:58:28,15,0.91,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1i98kks/analyzing_every_single_player_on_the_rip_city/,Admirable-Speech-308,,"While I was working on this thread already did like 5 players and the whole thread reset so apologies if it isn’t as good 😞

The Remix only current G League draftee they still have this season is a 25-year-old Sterling Manley who played college at UNC before stops in China, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, speaking of the Dominican Republic I’d like to quote a fascinating article I saw Blazers Edge post on Justin Minaya and the other 2 two way players, this post I’m making here is only highlighting non Two Ways but here’s the article if you wanna read it: [https://www.blazersedge.com/2025/1/4/24332536/portland-trail-blazers-rip-city-remix-g-league-bryce-mcgowens-taze-moore-justin-minaya-rotation](https://www.blazersedge.com/2025/1/4/24332536/portland-trail-blazers-rip-city-remix-g-league-bryce-mcgowens-taze-moore-justin-minaya-rotation)

Now we begin:

I had actually never heard of Estonia before Henri Drell existed, he’s currently averaging 20.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals for the Remix this season, the 6 ft 9 guard is apparently also the second Estonian player to ever play (I didn’t even know there was a first, it’s Martin Muursepp who was drafted as the 25th pick in the 1996 draft and averaged a career 4.7 points) what’s cool is that Henri has played in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls who signed him to a two way contract last season, but this season he has joined Rip City and would be cool to see him getting called up or signed to a two way if any trades happen, his father mother and sister were all basketball players and he’s a certified hooper in his blood

James Bouknight: People forget dude was a lottery pick in the 2021 Draft, wasn’t played much as a rookie but in the 6 games he played over 20 minutes he averaged double digits off efficient shooting every single game from 18 to 24 to 13 several times and in the G League in his rookie season he averaged 21.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.9 steals and a block off efficient shooting, he kinda balanced between hooping similar numbers in the G League and the NBA throughout the rest of his career until this year I don’t wanna stick into controversy but Bouknight was battling poor mental health while with the Hornets especially because of the off court stuff that if you know you know, and I just hope he’s doing better mentally now

Aleem Ford is a 6 ft 8 Puerto Rican hooper who plays the forward and bounced around overseas, the Cavs and the Magic and now finally the Remix, he’s only been off the bench averaging 7.3 points in the Tip Off Tourney but in college Ford started all 31 games for the Badgers, who were a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but the 26 year old averaged much more internationally and in the G and most recently he helped Puerto Rico qualify for the Olympics and when Ford was on the floor Puerto Rico actually led 29-25 after the first quarter before getting blown out against the US and against LeBron and Curry in limited minutes for Ford he had ten points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals Off the bench, he’s shown he can hoop when given the minutes, but now we can only wait and see…

Romeo Weems is averaging a modest 6.4 points & 1.2 steals off 60% from the field in 17 min off the bench after playing a couple seasons for the Grizzlies in the G League and in the Summer League and even appeared in 2 preseason games, coming off a **Big East All-Rookie Team** for DePaul he went straight to Memphis and then was picked by Rip City in the expansion draft, so technically he’s an OG Rip City Remix.

Seattle fans and Portland fans have forever been interlinked as most Portland fans I know follow the Seahawks and a few Seattle people I know who are upset over the SuperSonics leaving follow the Blazers and not OKC which is interesting to me but makes sense because of how close the cities are, and Cameron Tyson who I love most about him is his beard lol but he was a Seattle HOOPER, I can go thru his whole career with SU but I just want to go thru last season I mean he was the 2024 College Basketball Invitational tournament MVP, a NABC First Team All-District, First Team All-WAC and the man started every game he played to lead SU in scoring and minutes played, second ranked scorer in the WAC and 83rd in the nation, and his last game in college was a loud 30-point bomb in the the championship game of the CBI his 117 made threes last season was the second most for a single season at Seattle U ranking No. 1 in the WAC and third in the nation in just a little 2-3 year stretch he became just the second player ever to don a Seattle U jersey to surpass 2,000 career points, I can go on for hours about the Seattle U Athlete of the Year but we have to talk about how he’s been doing in the G League and he’s been averaging little minutes but off the bench in the G League Tip Off Tourney he came up in the clutch averaging 10.4 points off 43/44/88 splits and as a starter he averaged 12.3 points off 43/43/100 splits and also grabbing 5.5 rebounds a game, he’s just a pure hooper watch these college highlights and come back to me and can’t wait to see what he can do the rest of the season [https://youtu.be/qyPWhifM19M?si=BGxr85DPIAmA\_bSj](https://youtu.be/qyPWhifM19M?si=BGxr85DPIAmA_bSj)

Now say that 10 more times, 8.5 points and 7.5 rebounds and 2 blocks per game and 63% from the field and 50% from 3 in the G Leagye tourney AND AND AND yada yada, as a fucking SEVEN FOOTER, I wanna see this dude and Clingan on the same floor that would just be hilarious, the Ukrainian had a 2 way with the Knicks but glad we have him now, and so glad he isn’t Russian (I’m just joking, I come from a Russian background)

[This is an actual photo of him](https://preview.redd.it/uiqukgg6p0fe1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c377aff4954fbb6f2f68b0c93818fe5cad276bd)

REESE CAN YOU PASS THE CHEESE, we say in unison (or maybe we don’t) but maybe instead we should say FUCK OKC for waiving my guy after only playing him one game, my guy was a HOOPER in Alabama but sadly went undrafted and ended up working at a mf bar, your Rip City Remix legend was also a Bartending legend as well, (MyCareer Ah Storyline) I bet he switched tables at the bar as well as he hooped but eventually RIP CITY came calling as they always do and he played for them last season as well as securing him to play for Portland in the 2024 NBA Summer League and now this season he’s averaging 8 more points in the Tip Off Tourney than last season and starting the season as an OKC Thunder he came right back home and starting the regular season he’s averaging 18.8 points off 46/35/90 splits with a whopping 7.5 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.9 blocks as a 6 ft 9 forward, I think he deserves a 2 way somewhere for sure considering he had a non 2 way contract in his hands just a bit ago 

[He didn’t pass the cheese 😔 ](https://preview.redd.it/xroh3tfwr0fe1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5878f592581f40ec58ae010fe795a8db7311ed9)

|Isaac Nogues Gonzalez (ESP)|6|North Macedonia|FIBA U20 EuroBasket|

This is a graph showing how much steals Isaac Nogues had in just one game this season in the FIBA U20 EuroBasket, the leader of steals in the EuroBasket was Ben Saraf with 8 in a game and then second is Ben Saraf with 7 in a game, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBuK-xxLINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBuK-xxLINE) Isaac broke the steals record for Rip City this season with 10 in a game in the Tip Off Tourney he averaged 4.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.2 steals and in the regular season so far it’s been only 2 steals but 7 rebounds and 4.6 assists, crazy Aura for a role player, and he’s also from Spain so…hell yeah Amigo 🫡

I think I covered every single non Two Way, wait oh shit saved the best for last, in the Tip Off Tourney Xavier Johnson averaged 10.2 points, 4.2 rebounds a steal and a whopping 8 assists in the fucking G League and you understand how crazy that is as this was in less than 20 min and only 4 players besides for him in the entire G League averaged more than 8 assists, people aren’t pass first players in the G cause everyone’s trying to make it out, the man entered high school at 5'6, but grew six inches by his senior year, and the WCAC Player of the Year, first-team All-State and first-team All-Metro high ranked prospect and ACC All-Freshman select was the first Pitt freshman to lead the team is scoring since 1985 and was the only player in the ACC to average at least 15 points and 4.5 assists per game, he was a top draft prospect but injuries ruined it all, broke his foot in a game against Kansas for Indy on December 17, 2022, forcing him to miss the entire season and forcing him to play another year in college but 2 years before his last year in Indiana he was HOOPING which “he credited his mid-season turnaround to his grandfather's death in early February, along with strong chemistry with fellow teammate Trayce Jackson Davis” I mean He ended that season averaging 12.1 points and 5.1 assists per game off a rocky start and his 172 assists that year were the 5th most in a season in Indiana Hoosiers history, I mean he’s 26 years old now so he’s a really good veteran for rip city and a good asset to this team, a pass first, hard worker, and good story for the young guys

We have been planning our wedding for 2 years now and have been trying to get blessings from both sides of our families but only my family was supportive of our decision to get married.
While receiving racist remarks from my to-be in-laws, they disapproved of us getting married and wanted us to wait a while before settling down.

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning. I also asked a family friend's daughter (4F) to be the flower girl after the engagement and her mom agreed.

Fast forward about a year since the flower girl was confirmed: My boyfriend's older brother and his wife recently gave birth to a baby girl (let's call her Amy) and they have been badgering us about allowing their baby (will be 11MO by the time of the wedding), my fiancé's niece, be the flower girl.

My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle. When we initially said 'no' to that idea (as I think it's weird giving the role of a flower girl to a child that wont be physically able to do any of the normal flower girl duties and it would look ugly having a toddler walk down next to an adult holding a baby), Amy's father and Amy's grandmother kept on badgering us with the same questions:

""Can Amy be the flower girl?""
""What color theme is your wedding? We'll buy a dress for Amy.""
""Since Amy is our first and only grandchild, it's tradition for our family for her to be flower girl""

AITAH to reject Amy as the flower girl??? 🥲

Here is some context:
Amy's father and my boyfriend have two other siblings
Amy is currently 7MO and cannot crawl or sit up unassisted.
Amy's father and Amy's grandmother make racist comments about me behind my back."

**Part 46: The Train to the End of the World**

.

.

“We need to run,” speaks the **Stranger** to the **last Seeker**. “It's a long way to the train station and we only have 30 Minutes left!”

.

The **Seeker** wants to leave the stage, but they are surrounded by people with Microphones and Cameras. They loudly yell their questions.

.

A Honey-badger with a hat blocks the pathway of the **Seeker**. 

“Who are you? What is the name of your band? When will we hear you next time?”

.

The **Seeker** thinks for a moment. They go inwardly to discuss the name of their band. All Archetypes come to an agreement:

.

“WE ARE THE TRIBE OF HUMANITY,” announces the **Seeker** with the united voice of 11 Spirits. A sudden windbreeze gushes over the market place. “And you will soon hear more of us.”

.



https://preview.redd.it/g2e6l0rvpzee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1746e0699e57e0298b76cfe8705a431624600c08

.

The **Seeker** pushes themselves through the dense crowd, as the Cameras keep flashing and the Journalists all talk at once.

.

The **Seeker** walks past many former Servants and Heralds. Many of those who used to wear either black or white now wear colorful outfits. They have all turned into new **Seekers**. Some wear blue, some red, others yellow, green, purple, orange clothes. Also many of the birds, who were present since the first song, cheer at the **Seeker**. The whole crowd applauds.

.

Some viewers try to touch them, but the **Seeker** pushes through the Crowd. It's like they break through a wall of people. A struggle. With a lot of force, the **Seeker** pushes through.

.

At the end of the crowd are those who still wear either Black or White. Both Groups, the Servants of Order as well as the Heralds of Chaos have lost members drastically.

.

.

“You!” shouts the Rebel leader and points at the **Seeker**. 

“It's your fault, we lost half of our members! You will pay for this!”

.

“Don't think that we have forgotten how you eat your cornflakes!” scoffs the leader of the Service of Order. 

“Say Rebel-Scum, how about a temporary truce? Its this Song! We can't allow it to spread any further. Let us stop fighting until we got this matter with the song resolved...”

.

“I agree,” nods the Woman in Black. 

“This song is too dangerous. Not just to Chaos and Order but to the entire system. We won't be able to stop them on our own. If you wanna team up, we're in!”

.

.

.

While the Representatives of both Groups shake hands, the **Seeker** runs away. They run as fast, as they can, leaving the Town Center behind.

.

The **Stranger** matches their pace. 

“Wow! They actually made peace. The Prophecy came true after all. Who would have thought, that it's their shared resentment of you, which would unite them at last... ”

.

.

.

The **Seeker** takes a look behind, as they run through the main city street. A huge crowd of people runs after them. Reporters who have questions. Fans who want to hear them sing. Heralds and Servants who want to catch them. The **Seeker** runs even faster. Sweat drip from their forehead.

.

Suddenly from the corner, Four humanoid Turtles in Trench-coats cross the way with the **Seeker**. Each of them makes a pose or flexes his muscles.

.

“Oh no,” groans the **Seeker**. “Not them again!”

.

**Athos** rides the Rollblades, **Porthos** on his skateboard grinds the sidewalk, **Aramis** surfs the asphalt with a Surfboard and **D'Artagnan** scratches the floor with his Skiboards. It's the **NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES**. Each of them matches the Speed of the Seeker.

.



https://preview.redd.it/83pngwrxrzee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9475a7aa8fb64c70afb0b0e0cb3caa0657edd44c

.

.

“Good job with that concert, Boss,” compliments **D'Artagnan** the **Seeker**. “Where will we go next, Master?“

.

.

“There is no 'We',” sighs the annoyed **Seeker**. 

“And there is no 'next'. And I am not your 'Master'.... Seriously stop calling me that. If it's about this Cosmic Joke thing, I can just explain it to you. Look, the answer is... You are--”

.

.

“I don't wanna know...” interrupts the Turtle loudly. 

“Life is serious. I can't just give up my attachment to the Drama of Life. I won't stop resisting. When we stood before the White Room outside of time, I was too afraid to take the next step. It was then that I realized, that I was never meant to laugh at the joke, but instead to lead you to the door. Because you are worthy of it. Please Master, share your Wisdom with us, so that the NEW-AGE-AWAKENED-RESISTANCE-TURTLES can thrive under your guidance.”

.

.

.

As the **Seeker** focuses on running away, they didn't even understand half of what the turtle is saying. 

“What?! Dude... Live your Own Life. I really don't have the time to play someone's Master. And you don't need someone else to tell you what to do, feel or think... Just learn to master your Self, as I am doing it right now. Then you don't need to ask anyone else for guidance. Because you will always find your own way.”

.

.

**Porthos** writes down the **Seeker's** words in a notebook. “Can you repeat the last sentence?”

.



https://preview.redd.it/iii6vtzwszee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85c9178230bec385e7f189f30bce8dd80616ab0b

.

“Is there a system of rituals, mantras or beliefs, you need to master the Self?” asks **A**ramis.

.

“Do you have any secret techniques?” asks **Athos** as he rolls smoothly over the asphalt. “You know, something that will make me enlightenend?”

.

.

“No,” huffs the annoyed **Seeker** who struggles to keep up with the fast pace. 

“Don't write that down. There is no system and there are no techniques. You just take some of the stuff I am saying out of context and turn it into ultimate Truth, into Dogma. (But you need to read between the lines. It's like being aware of the space between thoughts.) Don't follow the light of another person, instead find that light within you and shine it outwards.”

.

.

“Alright,” agrees **D'Artagnan**. 

“Porthos, write that down. Make it something like 'Thou shalt not take another ones light, but only shine thy own'.”

.

**Porthos** starts to scribble.

.

“Hey, I didn't say that! You are twisting my words!”

.

“We just make your teachings more digestible for a larger audience. By the way... We still need to make up our mind regarding your origin story. You know, for the mythological framework. Porthos suggested that we should go with the version that you come from another world. Athos claims it's easier to just copy an origin story from another myth, like the virgin birth of Hercules, or how Sargon from Akkad was abandoned as a child on a river.”

.

The **Seeker** stares at **D'Artagnan** in Disbelief. They have a hard time keeping up with the Turtles pace. 

“Audience? Origin Story? Mythological Framework? What the hell are you even talking about?! I don't want to be part of any of this!”

.

.

.

“We are doing all of this for you. We'll make sure, that your legacy will be remembered even long after you have passed. This will be the foundation of an organization, which will conquer first YouTown and then the world. We'll indoctrinate the people, so that they'll be afraid of going against us. We'll tell them comfortable lies, so that they stop searching for the truth within and instead accept our Belief System. Think about all the money, that this will bring us. We will no longer live in the Sewers, but in mansions. And we'll have cars and yachts and private jets.”

.

“What?!” shouts the baffled **Seeker**. 

“No, I don't want you to use my name to exploit other people! I don't want people to be trapped in another prison of thought or belief. Because all those programs are essentially all the same. I want people to be free. Not bound to some limited pattern of being. People need to think for themselves, not like sheep who only follow commands.”

.

.

The **Seeker** notices, how **Porthos scribbles** everything down on his Notebook. The **Seeker** grabs **Porthos** notebook, while running. They flip through the pages. Their eyebrows pull together.

.

“Hey, this is all wrong! You changed everything! There's not even a single sentence you captured correctly!”

.

.

“There should be room for some artistic Freedom,” asserts **Porthos** .

.

.

“You wrote: 'Be like sheep, who only follow commands.' This is literally the opposite of what I say!”

.

.

“Some of your ideas are too ahead of its time,” explains **D'Artagnan**. 

“We can't strive off too far from what's accepted. So we have to place your words in the traditional context of our culture. In other words, Sheep are just not yet ready to think for themselves. If you open the gate and set them free, they won't know how to survive on their own.”

.  
.

.

“What if we are wrong?” contemplates the **Seeker** as they speak with the voice of Humanity. 

“What if People are not like sheep but instead like Birds? Trapped in cages, whistling sad songs, as they dream of the skies beyond the metal bars. Unaware, that the key to their freedom already exists within them. If people don't learn how to free themselves now, when should they ever break their chains? Will they wait for someone to come save them until they die of old age, or will they free themselves?”

.

**D'Artagnan** shrugs. 

“Just give the birds bigger cages. Then they won't feel the need to escape.”

.

.

.

**The Seeker and the Stranger** stand at a corner. The street splits in two paths, one goes Left, the other goes Right. The **Seeker** turns their head. The crowd is still chasing them.

.

“The Train Station is over there,” speaks the **Stranger** and turns Left at the corner. The **Seeker** follows behind.

.

“How do you know?” asks the **Seeker**.

.

“I have been here before.”

.

At the end of the street, there is a giant Building. Baroque style architecture. There is a clock on the roof, above the entrance hall. The building is decorated with Gargoyles.

.



https://preview.redd.it/nq2i66q3xzee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e32b0a58a9e83fd52c8712400aec25721014ec9

.

.

“Only Five Minutes left, before our train departs,” speaks the **Stranger** under breath. 

“We need to hurry.”

.

The **Seeker** speeds up. Running faster and faster towards the Train station. Followed by a giant crowd of Turtles, other **Seekers**, Birds, Animal Spirits, Reporter, Journalists, Heralds of Chaos and Servants of Order.

.

.

.

“Where the hell are we going anyway?!” asks the **Seeker** as they give it their all to run away.

.

.

“We will cross the Abyss,” responds the **Mysterious Stranger** with a serious tone in his voice. 

“To most Seekers, the Abyss is the end of the Journey. An insurmountable chasm. Some say, it's impossible to cross the Abyss. Others believe it to be the last Threshold, before Enlightenment. Many have tried. Many have failed. It's time to make the impossible possible, Seeker. We'll cross the Abyss and make it to the other side. We'll enter into the mythical land of NIRVANA.”

.

.

“Why should I, of all Seekers, be the one to make it to the other side?”

.

The **Stranger** grins. 

“Because I am with you. And when we walk together, not even Gravity can hold us back.”

.

The **Seeker** opens the Glass door and walks with the **Seeker** into the Central Train Station. Only few of the crowd follow the **Seeker** into the Baroque building. Most stay outside.

.

.

.

.

“Damnit,” huffs the angered Rebel woman from the newly formed alliance. 

“They got away from us! We'll put a bounty on their head and print WANTED Posters. Does anyone even know their name?”

.

The Agent in White remains calm. 

“Forget about this Stranger for now. Stopping this song from spreading is of a higher priority. This song has the potential to break the entire system. It threatens the foundation of both of our organizations. First we need more information. We need a list of everyone who sang along. We'll hunt them all down. This song will be illegal. Singing it, will be punished harshly.”

.

.

.

.

Meanwhile **the Seeker and the Stranger** run through the central train station. Pushing through the crowd. They stand in the underpass corridor with elevators and stairs leading to each track. They stand before the elevator to track Number 1.

.

The **Seeker** looks at the Train-Ticket. “We need to be on track 144”

.

.

“Only Three Minutes left,” speaks the **Stranger**. The entire corridor is full of people. Some following the current, some walking against it. Track 144 is in the other direction.

“Okay Seeker, I will now tell you a secret trick. Something, that you can test at home. I'll show you how to create a path, when going against the Stream. When you walk against a stream of passerby's, in a crowded space, focus your eyes on where you want to go. Aim with your eyes for a target in the distance. Don't look at the people who walk against your direction. If you look at them, your gaze will send them the unconscious signal, that you will make space for them. Which sometimes causes misunderstandings and leads to both passerby's blocking eachother.



If you don't look at them but keep your head straight forward, people will automatically make space for you. They will create an opening to let you through. But be completely aware of everything around you. Be aware of people and objects without recognizing them. Keep Your Thought silent and be completely in the present.



You can try this out yourself, next time you are in the public. If someone crosses your path from the other direction keep your head and gaze straight. Don't look at them, but be aware of their presence. And with your gaze alone, you will part the crowd, as Thutmose once parted the sea.”

.

.

.



The **Seeker** looks over the corridor, observing the In-Stream of Many People passing through. The **Seeker** walks against the stream towards Gate 144. They observe all the various people, crossing their path. Comparing the different outfits. The Seeker keeps bumping into passing travelers with their shoulders, arms or hips. Only 2 Minutes Left.

.

.

The **Seeker** makes little to no progress going against the Stream. “Alright... Let's try your Trick then...”

.

Eyes close. A Deep inhale. As their eyelids open, they reveal burning eyes. The **Seeker** stares at the end of the corridor, where the Gate to the 144^(th) track is situated. As they walk forward with their gaze fixed, all who cross their path create space for the **Seeker**. It's as if an invisible wall splits the crowd, creating an even distance between the Seeker and all other Travelers. 1 Minute left.

.



https://preview.redd.it/zvu8uipdzzee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18d48ba8695af79be5cd00eacf68ce20b9f07879

.

The **Seeker** walks confidently through the corridor, that the crowd creates for them. The crowd gets thinner, the further the **Seeker** moves to track 144. When the corridor is free, the **Seeker** starts to run.

.

The **Seeker** stands in front of the final elevator. Leading up to the 144^(th) track of the train station. The Elevator carries the exhausted **Seeker** right to the tracks. Their racing heart calms down.

  
.

.

**The Seeker and the Stranger** stand on the platform of track 144. The **TRAIN TO THE END OF THE WORLD** is parked on the rails. Suddenly all Doors close down. Time Over.

.

The **Seeker** rushes to the nearest door, but it closes right before their eyes. Their heart freezes in shock. They press the button multiple times, but the door doesn't react.

.

“This can't be happening...”

.

But suddenly, to the surprise of the **Seeker**, the train door opens up again.

.

Behind the Door stands a man with a short, brown Beard, a Cowboy hat and leather jacket. He looks like an explorer. It is the **ONE TRUE SEEKER**. He has pushed the button to let the last **Seeker** in.

.



https://preview.redd.it/4br23h7g00fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bd2b95e3e2f9092bc7d09af74778258be084a6e

  
.

.

The **Seeker** steps through the door into the Train to the End of the World,

.

“Thank you,” speaks the **Seeker** to the man with cowboy hat. 

“I already feared the worst.”

.

“No worries mate,” grins the **ONE TRUE SEEKER** calmly. 

“We are not in competition. After all, the doors to the Kingdom are open to all of us. Isn't that right, Stranger?”

.

The **Stranger** grins. 

“All parallel timelines cross in the Train of Life. Together, we all head to the end of the World. To venture out into the Unknown. A journey to the other side. All together we ride the Train of Destiny. To the Point of No Return. This is a gathering of the most advanced Seekers. This is the Path of Track 144. Together we will make it to the Kingdom. Each one of us in our own experience. Because the Kingdom dwells within us. And thus all of us cross the metaphorical Abyss within. As above, so below. Here in this train, all the Seekers are united. All Paths become One.”

.

The **Seeker** looks around the train. Every Seat is occupied by a different **Seeker**. Some of their faces look familiar.

.

.

.

“I am sure, I have seen those people before... Perhaps in a Dream...”

.

The train starts moving. Suddenly the **Seeker** has a Dejavu, as they look how the Train moves forward through a tunnel.

.

“This... I am sure, I have seen this happening already...”

.

**The Seeker and the Stranger** sit down on the last remaining seats. The Seeker listens to the voice of the Speakers:

**“NEXT STOP: THE END OF THE WORLD”**

.

.

The Train get's faster and faster. The Buildings, Skyscrapers, Blocks and Avenues arise in the **Seekers** view and fade away again.

.



https://preview.redd.it/0ecczcrn30fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5de7350c2d496807d20ff34cae0e59229efae108

.

“So if all the other people in here are Seekers just like me, ” asks **the Seeker the Stranger**. 

“Did they all have like the same Quests? What did they experience before coming here? Can they also see you? Or do they have their own Mysterious Stranger? There are so many questions and I am so confused... Who am I?”

.

“You are THE LAST SEEKER,” grins the **Stranger**. 

.

.

**NEW PLAYABLE CHARACTER UNLOCKED:**

.

**THE LAST SEEKER**

.

.

“Basically all of us had the same journey up until now with only minor variations. You could say, their paths went parallel to your own path. Their own experiences lead them to this shared point in time. You could say, all of us are now part of the first Wave.”

.

“Wave?” asks the **Seeker**.

.

“Yes, there will be more waves to come in the future. Of people who walk this Path. You see, how every place in this train is filled? Next Wave will be more crowded.”

.

.

As the TRAIN TO THE END OF THE WORLD leaves the city walls of YouTown behind, a maniacal laughter crackles from the the rooftops.

.

“You thought some bloody Brick could kill me? Huh, Seeker?! Ya mad cunt thought you could get away with it, huh?! Guess what! I am marked as 'essential'. Neither falling Stones, nor trampling Feet, not even Fire Damage can hurt me. I will make you pay for all of my suffering. Nothing can stop me and I will soon come for you, Seeker!”

.

# LIZARD CULT: LORE & BACKGROUND



https://preview.redd.it/6b030x4t00fe1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafe47bc78a151d764ce795ce53be238e49189ac

*My sorrow is a leaf that reached the ground, my rage is a wind that dies, and my demon is a sleeping child, for I have drunk the Noenokyn*. These words mark the end of the ritual by which a novel acolyte joins the Path Of Walking By Day, by far the most ancient religion in the woodlands. The Noenokyn, a beverage mixing water, barley, spices and occasionally honey or wine, is imbibed by the convert after extensive purification rituals inside one of the apposite crypts built beneath each lizard garden.

The effects of the Noenokyn are more than spiritual, for the convert who drinks it putatively loses the faculty of feeling any physical or emotional sensation of their own, and turns numb to the outside world, like a tree or a stone. Though unresponsive and hollow-eyed to those around them, these followers are said to gain access to an entire new realm of unseen experience, known by their priests as the Torrent Of Light Azure. Here, if proponents of the religion are to be believed, all of the acolytes exist together and are always feeling exactly the same emotions and moods, pains and pleasures, in a sort of heightened amalgam of all their living experiences combined. Wound an acolyte of the Path, and the individual will not respond, yet all of them will feel the hurt; offer an acolyte shelter, and though the individual will offer no thanks, all who share in the religion will know gratitude. It is claimed that the acolytes can no longer even dream for themselves, and instead all experience a single, giant lucid dream which they access any time they fall asleep.

The Path Of Walking By Day, also known as Issheoma’ggaoag’ashar in the reptile tongue, as Roianora Karoldheia in Belarian, as Ten Arya Ashar in some of the older Eyrie codices, and variously again as the Messengers of Dawn, the Forsaken, the Word Within The Cold, or the One And Many, are most widely known in the woodlands by their colloquial nickname – the Lizard Cult, so called because among all the creatures of the forest, lizards alone are ever awarded priesthood.

With the possible exception of the legendary stone of Arandill, there is nothing in the woodland that predates the Lizard Cult. Before the forefathers of the underground dukes began sculpting their rocky halls, before one member of the archaic nobility of the otters first placed his legendary desk in the town square for loans and trades, before even the First Roost was founded and the earliest syllables of history were recorded by the polymaths of the Eyrie Dynasties, the Lizard Cult was breathing in the darkness. Their symbols have been discovered in caves dating back to before the Age of Myths, and their beliefs, so far as even the most learned historians can discern, have never suffered change, amendment or corruption, not once since their inception.

https://preview.redd.it/smoahtuk20fe1.jpg?width=681&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b5df3ea77cd865cca8f278e06f5706de4c96364

These beliefs appear unreasonably abstruse for the layman, yet there can be no understanding of the Cult without at least a grasp of the basic theology. The so-called ‘Lizard God’, for example, is often painted as central to the religion. In fact it is a misnomer, referring to an entity that in Path cosmogony is titled Tauss’Ttiochter (an expression in the reptile tongue that means *autogod*), who laid the egg of itself and began the cycle of being. Though the sacred texts resist simple elucidation on this matter, it can be said that this egg, in one of its many cycles, mysteriously nourished and released into the emptiness four entities referred to as the Tzanikh’eTtiochtai (the *archgods* or *beforegods*), lording over matter, life, spirit and chaos respectively. It was these ‘archgods’ who started the process of creation out of nothing, and creation in turn was organized into its current form by yet another sixteen entities springing from the original four. These sixteen entities are what the acolytes actually refer to when they use the word Ttiochai, or *gods*.

Contrary to prejudice, the Lizard Cult do not worship this pantheon in its entirety (the autogod in particular is considered beyond worship). Instead, they celebrate exclusively the archgod of life, and even then not directly, but by honouring its four descendant gods. The practice is further complicated by the fact that it is considered sacrilege not just to speak but even to know the names of these gods; in writing they are indicated by combinations of ciphers (their approximations, as codified by the Eyrie polymaths, are JYJ, RRCM, KSDSNN and WHTR respectively), while in the spoken word they are referred to indirectly by the commands they give to their followers. Thus, for example, JYJ is believed to be a joyful spirit, and so her command is ‘sing’. Cult followers will then confusingly declare ‘I love to sing’ and then go quiet, which is in fact a way of communicating ‘I am a worshipper of JYJ’.

As old as these complex traditions are, they have almost always been practised in a fragmentary, partial form. The Cult was never a great power in the ancient times, and what records remain of the long extinct Belarian Empire mention them only in passing. It is believed that they played a decisive role in the War of the Seven Fires (also known as the First Dynastic War), in which their priests were said to wield great mystic powers of perverse, even unstoppable violence. Although the history of that ancient war is uncertain, by all accounts it was precisely the devastation engendered by their own mystics – almost leading to the genocide of the Lilypad Ur-Nation – that led the lizards to take administrative command of the Path, and to forbid the use of their transcendent powers forever, turning them into a minor force for generations to come.

Many centuries later, the destruction wrought on the woodlands by the Third Dynastic War would bring radical change for the Lizard Cult. A platoon of rogue Eyrie knights smashed the immortal icon of KSDSNN, removing the entity’s presence from the collective feeling of the Cult. Far more so than the loss of life that came with the war, it was the vanishing of this transcendent presence that was mourned by the cultists, for its command was the most basic and gentle of them all: *love*. The connection with this divinity removed, in the years since they were warred on and hunted it is said that the followers of the Lizard Cult no longer love.

Their tragic loss notwithstanding, for the formerly flagging Lizard Cult the Third Dynastic War marked a period of enormous expansion. The Path Of Walking By Day had always represented a refuge for the trampled, the grieving, and the defeated, and that terrible conflict had left many such lost souls looking for consolation. Some would argue that conversion was anything but that, for it erased the self and all of its sensibilities, offering in return only the remote feeling of a spiritual essence as dark as it was incomprehensible. Yet many of those who came to the Cult were so shattered in spirit that they saw this prospect as an improvement, and believed that even should their new world be one of torment, it would still be better than the lives of uncompromising misery they wished to leave behind.

https://preview.redd.it/f273rnyl20fe1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=466928cddb234586d83c6680b46d849809bbd054

Growing quickly from a fringe handful of worshippers into a proper religious organization, in the generations leading to the present day the Cult became more potent and widespread in the woodlands than ever before, drawing converts from every clan. Its expansion was never forceful or violent, for in battle the Cult – still self-forbidden from using their ancient powers – were among the most pitiful of combatants. Instead they grew the way that parasites do, taking every orphan, every widow, every soldier bereft of purpose, every refugee fleeing from their burning home, in brief everyone who came to them, into the unfathomable nature of their equalising embrace.

Years rolled quietly by, as the Third Dynastic War receded first into the tales of grandparents, then into the writings of historians. The Path Of Walking By Day was bereft of love, but otherwise unchanged as it always had been. The Eyrie Dynasties slowly re-emerged as a powerful machine of war, the Lilypad Diaspora made its armed return to the woodlands, and the Riverfolk Company armoured and expanded itself. Only the Cult never learned the way of the sword, and allowed its forbidden esoteric violence to sleep, seemingly unaffected even by the invasion of the Marquise de Cat. Yet it would not be long before the terrifying bloodbath that had long been bubbling under the woodlands would rise to drown their gardens too.

The ascent of the Lord of the Hundreds would represent an emergency for every power in the woodlands, of course – but none more so than the Lizard Cult. When the Lord’s murderous swarms of rats poured out from the woods and began their drooling march north, it appeared that nothing could stop them. Previously inviolable cat garrisons were butchered, isolated Eyrie nobles were captured and tortured to death, and even the Corvid Conspiracy seemed eager to abandon their plots and simply pack up and leave wherever the Lord of the Hundreds imported his rage.

It would not be long before the Lizard Cult was trampled as well. The rats marched into the Garden of Souls, one of the four mythical places of worship for the Path Of Walking By Day, and home to the icon of JYJ, spirit of singing. The first acolytes emerged bearing flowers for their visitors, but were skewered where they stood – and thus began the massacre. When a pale sun rose again on the Garden of Souls, there was nothing left to see but a field of broken statues. The icon of JYJ had been torn from its pedestal and ground into rubble, the bodies of the acolytes (or the remaining pieces of them) tossed into a common grave, but the youngest squirrel among them was left alive. The rats nailed his bleeding body to a hallowed cypress, allowing his screams to rise up to the sky. It was an act of deliberate sacrilege in a spot which for centuries had known no sound but *song*, and was now reduced to that solitary hymn of agony.

The invasion was catastrophically destructive for the Lizard Cult. In fact, the true effects would be more than enduring – they would be eternal. For now it is said among the inhabitants of the woodlands that, for the first time in its impossibly long history, the Lizard Cult no longer sings.

In a diplomatic initiative of unprecedented scale, the Lizard Cult dispatched priests to the other powers and requested their assistance in defending themselves. Initially the results were disheartening. Eyrie and Duchy nobles treated the lizards with barely disguised aristocratic scorn, the Twilight Council’s institutional efforts were incipient and far too slow, while the cats were far too preoccupied with defending their own holdings to bother with a potential military ally so famously weak. Eventually, the lizards managed to hire – at extortionate prices – two divisions of mercenaries from the Riverfolk Company. While this was nowhere near enough to stop the rats, it at least managed to divert the ever-growing and northbound mob towards softer targets in the east.

Far from buying themselves respite, however, the unfortunate Lizard Cult would almost immediately find new invaders knocking at their doors. This time the threat came from the west, as the merciless legions of a mysterious new power began streaming into the forest. Far more methodical than the rats but in no way less brutal, the force that would come to be known as the Keepers in Iron first razed a base of the Woodland Alliance, then continued their march into the clearing of the Garden of Evening. It was home to the great icon of RRCM, whose command was *forgive*.

The Keepers in Iron would be aptly so titled, for they wore armour that proved impenetrable to the simple weapons of the Cult. Their aggression completely unprovoked, the badgers marched into the garden and sliced acolytes in half with their alabasters. When they were done slaughtering the fighters, they enslaved the survivors and had them turn over the earth of their own homes with shovels as the sky grew the colour of amber behind them. Destroying the foundations of the Cult’s structures, the badgers also smashed the icon of RRCM, and in doing so made what, in time, might turn out to be the greatest mistake of any of the woodland’s factions in the current war. For it is said that ever since that bloody morning, the Lizard Cult no longer forgives.

Beneath the Cult’s garden, the Keepers were able to recover an ancient red drinking horn, a simple artefact of unclear significance, not studded with jewellery nor bearing any special signs other than those of great age. From there they kept marching east into the woodlands, and now a great collective fear was felt by every last acolyte together. For the badgers were headed for the last of their great sites of worship, the Garden of the Flame. Here the god WHTR was worshipped, the only one whose icon had not yet been smashed. If that too was destroyed, then the members of the Lizard Cult would never feel anything again, and would be lost in their collective cosmos with the guidance of no god – and forever.

Diplomatic efforts to find support proved futile, as the Riverfolk Company were now dealing with an unexpected offensive on their trade posts by the Underground Duchy and the Lilypad Diaspora working together. The Lizard Cult was forced to mount a desperate last line of defence, as acolytes flocked to their final garden from every surrounding clearing and beyond.

The subsequent battle raged and lasted almost the full day. At last the great Keepers in Iron broke through the defensive line and stomped their bloody way towards the centre of the garden. The children screamed and it would have been doom for the Lizard Cult, were it not that then, just then, there emerged from the thick of the woods a giant of legend – the Knight of Walking by Day, also known as the Furious Protector. Descending into battle with breathless and unmitigated fury, the Protector tore to shreds the armour of the Keepers in Iron and killed countless of their warriors, forced as many more into submission. The remaining badgers were forced into retreat, and the surviving acolytes circled around the Protector as though attending a divine creature.

Reduced to numbers so low and resources so scant, the Lizard Cult now appeared to be on the brink of extinction. And yet in the weeks that followed, their numbers yet again saw a sudden, unprecedented surge, dwarfing even their growth after the Third Dynastic War. Lost souls from the forest were pouring into the Garden of the Flame to become unfeeling acolytes, all of them refugees from the many conflicts elsewhere in the forest. Cat oppression had torn families apart. Revolts by the Woodland Alliance had turned peaceful settlements into war zones. The Underground Duchy had attacked the keep of the Marquise, while the Eyrie Dynasties and the Lord of the Hundreds clashed at the Battle of the Anvil. Hundreds, then thousands of survivors from these conflicts fled into the arms of the Lizards.

https://preview.redd.it/py4q2xpo20fe1.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d86769b5888e329ef26da08e48fb217a0bffafc7

Patiently, the Lizard Cult converted all who came to them. The new acolytes were introduced to the shared experienced of the Path Of Walking By Day, though this was now impoverished by the loss of three of the four gods with their divine commands to love, to sing and to forgive. The surviving lizard priests, many of them scarred or burned horribly, came together in the last garden to plan the way forward.

Amid the smoke and the ruins, one thing if nothing else was clear for all to see. The peaceful, neutral ways that had shuttled the Lizard Cult through the Second and the Third Dynastic Wars were no longer useful. In every cardinal direction the woodlands were now embroiled in war, and enemies seemed to be roving everywhere. The Cult would have to rebuild its gardens and this time establish firm, unbreakable defences. Even now, their military remains undeniably weak: their warriors are poorly armed, and many of them already broken or hurt. And yet it is also a military unique among all others for its ability to draw back strength after losing a battle, as many of the wounded, even from the opposing sides, come to the Cult to swell its ranks again.

More importantly, the weapons that the old religion has at hand are no longer sword and lance alone. For it is the obscure spiritual powers wielded by the Lizard Cult that their ancient enemies fear, and that their new enemies will learn to fear. By accessing the deeper currents of the Torrent Of Light Azure, lizard priests can violate the minds of their opponents and forcibly drag them into their beliefs – a repugnant practice of conversion forbidden by the Cult for centuries, but now, at last, being contemplated once again. Some of their higher priests are so powerful that they could convert entire garrisons with a single night of prayer, even from great distance, effectively turning a piece of infrastructure built by another faction into one of their own sites of worship. And Lizard priests working in concert beneath their gardens are capable of exerting an obscure mental aura around their possessions, creating an oppressive, nightmarish psychological effect that can deter anyone but the psychopath commandos of the Corvid from marching through the Cult’s territories. Against these things there is almost no known defence.

In what is already being called Kari’jja du’Karai (*Night of Nights* in the reptile tongue) there must be long deliberation for the lizard priests, based less on logic than dogma. What new dawn shall thenceforth rise upon the Cult, this nobody can say. Shorn of the three gods that together represented everything in the world that is gentle, the acolytes of the Lizard Cult no longer sing, they no longer love, and they no longer forgive. As they descend like dark primordial thunder upon their enemies, it is not strategy, or interest, or even survival that resonates in their unified minds, but only the command of the last and bleakest of their gods. *Burn*."

My no-contact turns one year old next month,raisedbynarcissists,1i94hyj,2025-01-24 15:01:36,11,0.92,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i94hyj/my_nocontact_turns_one_year_old_next_month/,Much_Pomegranate2042,[Progress],"On February 8, 2024, I (24NB) blocked my NMom (60F) on all platforms for the second time in my life. I broke the first one after a couple of years and a lot of time in COVID lockdown (fortunately not with her) when it hit me that, due to familial health issues, I truly don't expect her to live to a ripe old age. I decided that, when she does die, which I expect to be sooner rather than later, I had to know for my own peace of mind that I'd done everything I could.

NMom and my dad (M55) divorced when I was nine and my little brother was six. We spent the next ten or so years going back and forth every week and, in hindsight, it was harrowing for our mental health. I isolated in on myself, hiding in my room in the basement as much as possible, and I got off far easier than my brother (former Golden Child here. Probably ended up not as bad as others because I was also the Peacemaker. Brother and I fought like crazy but we have talked since and he has never once called me part of the problem, so I'm choosing to trust his judgment).

NMom was possessive and self-centered, particularly of me as, at the time, everyone still thought I was a girl and this woman is Definitely at least a closeted misandrist. She demanded to be involved in everything I did or said or was, which started us falling apart when I was seventeen. A series of hurtful incidents where she lashed out at me for wanting to spend time with my dad and stepmother and her threatening her help with my college payments later and I fully cut her off at nineteen, only to break it two years later and fall right back into the same patterns.

I guess I've always been too much of a hopeful with her. For years, the only thing I wanted was accountability. I wanted her to say the words ""I'm sorry"" to me and mean them. I don't think she realized that, had she done that, I probably would have forgiven everything on that basis alone. Those two words are incredibly powerful to me and are particularly good at defusing my anger, which, for the longest time, was the only defense I had against her guilt trips.

After Christmas of 2023, which I spent with her alone since Brother was living with his girlfriend in Maine, and which I was crying on the phone with a friend about the night before because I didn't want to go, I started going quieter. It wasn't deliberate - I was moving and she had badgered my old address out of me and I didn't want to give her the new one, so I simply didn't mention the move and it was eating up so much of my time that it meant I didn't message her at all. The longer I went without messaging, the worse I knew it would be when I finally reached back out again and so I kept putting it off, even when her texts saying that ""it would be really nice if you would respond to me"" sent me into an anxiety spiral that my friends, who all live several states away, had to talk me down from long distance.

I got through the move and then I started discussing the situation with my therapist and, on February 8th, I had a realization. I had broken my first no-contact because, when she dies, I needed to know that I had done everything I could. And I realized that day that I already had.

It matters a lot, I think, that I wasn't angry this time. My first bout of no-contact was triggered by anger and, once the anger burned out, it became harder to hold onto. This time, I was just tired. Tired and drained and crying tears of real relief once she was blocked. I had to call Brother before I did it to tell him my plan and I had to ask him to tell me that he would be all right (I was also parentified and can't quite shake the gut feeling that it's my responsibility to be there for him at all times. Working on it. Baby steps) but I went through with it. And almost a year later, I haven't considered undoing it for a second.

In two weeks, my no-contact turns one year old. I will be throwing it a birthday party. And then I'm going to sleep easier knowing that my life is only mine and my family is only made up of the people I have chosen to let in."

guys this scam isn’t new but i’ve just found out about it. this guy traded me and said they like my avatar and wanted to make art of it, this person asked for my discord and started the conversation there (screenshot 1) they make it seem like they’re doing the art and come back a few hours later but i was busy hence why there’s such a big gap and there are messages between these screenshots but they come back saying this (screenshot 2). they then proceed to send you a youtube link and luckily enough i looked up what he was asking and a youtube video from a year ago popped up (screenshot 3 incase you’re interested). i messaged them (screenshot 4) and they blocked me obviously 


*incase you don’t want to watch the youtube video it basically explains how the plan is to steal items or robux and in his specific case they spend his robux on roblox gambling sites so roblox cant do anything about it which makes it a horrible scam. they get you to share your cookies and they hack you through there (i also didn’t watch the whole thing so if you want more info i suggest looking!)*"

I was using a dry Philips OneBlade or Mach3 with gel at the time, which covered me in ingrown hairs and nasty razor burn. While electrics have their purpose, they were not for my face, which has a thick, corse and fast-growing beard.

I discovered this sub a year ago and finally dived in to wet shaving. The difference is dramatic. Sure, it takes a little longer, but my ingrown hairs are gone and razor burn drastically reduced. I'm very grateful for this community!

I am a mid-30s male with a thorough ""girly"" skin care routine. It works for me and have been doing it for three years. I feel like it has really helped my aging and made my skin look far better than it did in my 20s.

I was wondering if any other guys in the group have ""girly"" skin care routines and what your thoughts are on mine? It seems to work for me, but I'm always looking for improvements. 

Thanks!

"My (26f) boyfriend (32m) said that he wasn’t sure he wanted to marry me 3 months ago, but suddenly now has a change of heart. Why doesn’t that make me feel better?",relationship_advice,1i91ygw,2025-01-24 13:14:16,0,0.33,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i91ygw/my_26f_boyfriend_32m_said_that_he_wasnt_sure_he/,NoteAffectionate7909,,"TLDR: a sudden change of mind has thrown me for a loop, but I just can’t unhear a comment that made me feel awful about my relationship. Now I’m having trouble moving forward.

1 (26f) have been dating and living with my bf (32m) for 3.5 years. He knows how  important marriage and commitment are to me and has since before we were dating. Some months back, we got into an argument about getting engaged. At one point during the argument, he said something to the affect of “well if I was sure I wanted to marry you, we’d already be engaged.”

I won’t lie guys, that comment tore me apart. 3 years in and I’d personally felt so sure of us by that point. It was a combination of humiliation at feeling unworthy of being his wife, confusion at why he’d always said he wanted to marry me so casually, and feeling betrayed by that. But mostly, it was heartbreak. 

I did try to bring up the subject over the last few months, but he very much brushed me off not wanting to talk about it. Finally, yesterday I broke down and told him how horrible the comment made me feel. He reacted really well and apologized. 

He then went on to say that he actually WAS sure he wanted to marry me now because we had “gotten closer” over the last few months.

I feel the total opposite. I have spent the last few months bracing for the end, or accepting that if I was going to stay in this I would not be a wife until my 40’s.

He suggested “maybe next year” we’ll get engaged. Just like he said last year. And the year before that.

But to hit me with “oh yeah of course I want to marry you etc.” did not make me feel better the way I’d have expected. I might honestly feel worse, but I’m not entirely sure why. Now I just have this sinking feeling that if he does propose it’s only because I asked him to, which feels disgusting and humiliating. 

Now I’m caught in this place of feeling like I can’t win. 

If he proposes this year, in my head it’s because I badgered him. But the idea of sitting around waiting another year+ to be acknowledged as worthy of marrying also sounds like something I may not even be willing to put up with.

I guess my ultimate problem here is that I feel like no matter what happens, I can’t see anything but the negative side. I feel like that one comment really ruined my entire view on the whole thing and even after the conversation to try and fix things, I don’t feel any better than I did before having that conversation. 

I feel crazy, and I don’t know how to stop feeling that way. 

If you were me, how would you move forward?"
Daughter's bathroom habits at school are sending me over the edge.,breakingmom,1i91es7,2025-01-24 12:52:17,83,0.9,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1i91es7/daughters_bathroom_habits_at_school_are_sending/,holypopamole,school rant 🏫,"My daughter is in first grade at a small, rural private school. She is the stereotypical second child and has always chased to keep up with her (academically achieving) older brother. He loves to read, so she reads his books with him. He does math flashcards. She does his math flashcards. It all seems to come easy for her, although we work hard at home to foster a learning environment.

In Kindergarten, her teacher stressed that she was of the opinion that our daughter was gifted. I was proud and relieved to hear that she was doing well, but didn't go overboard. It's equally important to me that she has friends and builds relationships and that she is displaying appropriate behaviors in the school environment. I know the stress and anxiety a label can put on a kid, and I really don't want that for her. 

I volunteer about three times a quarter in her class because she has expressed that it means a lot to her, and honestly, I just love being with her. I wish I had the time to volunteer more often. It has been really insightful to read one on one with the other kids in her class or to help them with their math rotations. At the risk of sounding absolutely insufferable (probably too late), it has given me a reality check on where my kid is at. I do believe she is learning, but she isn't being challenged. The math sheets are not hard for her. The class is not reading books that are appropriate for her reading level. She has run out of vocabulary flashcards for the whole remainder of the year. Which brings us to the problem.

She is using the bathroom up to seven times a day. Every day. Sometimes it's four. Sometimes it's seven. Sometimes it's only 15 minutes apart. The teacher brought this up in the beginning of the year and mentioned that she was worried about it causing our daughter to fall behind. We talked to our daughter and she insisted it was because she really needed to use the bathroom. We took her to the doctor and she was declared medically fine. 

We explained to the teacher that we thought it was maybe related to our daughter's extremely high energy levels and needing to get up and move around. We asked if there were any suggestions the teacher had from past high energy kids (using an exercise band on the desk, movement breaks, etc). She said she would think about it but never got back to us. 

She began to express her concerns more often about the bathroom breaks. There was no longer concern about our daughter falling behind, but rather, that the other kids would fall behind during partner work when our daughter is in the bathroom. She sent home a few notes listing out the times of the bathroom breaks which helped to facilitate conversations with our daughter. We asked the teacher if she would be willing to keep sending home the notes to help us with positive reinforcement. I know this was probably a strain on her day, but it did work. We rewarded our daughter's behavior on days when she only visited the bathroom 2 or 3 times and we got into a great routine. Eventually, the teacher stopped sending home notes, believing the issue was solved. Not long after, we were back to six bathroom trips a day.

The teacher has begun to express her frustrations again. We haven't reached any solutions and I feel so anxious. Medically, she is fine. She loves school. She has friends. She does well. She doesn't seem to suffer from any anxiety. I am pulling my hair out and the only solution I can come up with is that she is bored from lack of stimulation. She finishes her work so fast that she has to seek some kind of stimulation? Conferences are coming up within a few weeks and I know this issue will come up again. I hope to be able to work with the teacher to build some more constructive options on what we could try differently. I badger my poor kid every dang day over this. I'm trying so hard.

Has anyone else been through this? Was it related to boredom/academic overachieving/excessive energy? Was there anything that worked for you? Is this a stupid manufactured problem? HELP!"

Well, I’m not allergic to Benadryl but it does make me feel like I’m going to have a heart attack. At one point I had no choice but to go to the ER for a particularly horrific attack. They hooked me up to a bunch of monitors and proceeded with the IV. They gave me Benadryl and alarms started going off because I became tachycardic and a very kind ER doc told me that I could be experiencing a paradoxical effect from the Benadryl. They had to counteract it with Valium. So here’s my question: is there anything I can use for my at home migraine kit that’s similar to Benadryl but won’t make me feel like I’m having a heart attack? Right now I have in my kit: electrolytes, Advil, Aleve, a microwaveable eye mask. A cold head wrap, lavender & bergamot Badger Balm, and meclizine. Is there anything I can use to “replace” the Benadryl. I’m also in a THC legal state so I try to have CBD:THC edibles on hand, as well as tri-magnesium.

My response usually is some version “well, why didn’t you go to the registrar and ask for help?” or “why do you keep having mom handle things for you if she isn’t helping?”

That’s just one example - I have 40+ yr old people in my life like this too. How can you help people realize that there’s more that they should be doing proactively to help themselves instead of expecting hand holding and giveaways? In a non-condescending or elitist way, of course. "

Then I thought... hmmm, what about Villy? Well, imo, if there would be any gods that get a boost in records to kill vipers, it would be badger gods!! The secret powerhouse of the multiverse!"
