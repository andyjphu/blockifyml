What’s the best strategy?,StepN,1i79bsu,2025-01-22 06:48:22,6,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i79bsu,CuteDaema,,"I joined STEPN a while ago when I bought my first common sneaker with 13 SOL @ $1.4k at that time. I reinvested all I earned(bad choice, should have recovered my investment first) and now I have those 3 sneakers with the uncommon one as my main. What do you think it’s best for me to do. Buy a lvl 4 Eff gem? Buy another 6 sneakers to increase energy lvl? Or simply run as it is and withdraw some money once gmt is gonna pump ( if it’s going to pump) "

Can I set up OG stepn account on android to use on iOS? ,StepN,1hrlg48,2025-01-01 23:20:12,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1hrlg48/can_i_set_up_og_stepn_account_on_android_to_use/,drogon-e,,"Hello! Got an OG stepn question.. 

I'm setting up a basic OG stepn account for my Dad. He's 70, doesn't fully understand crypto but has taken an interest and it'll be a great way for him to keep active and learn something new. 

Stepn Go prices are still a bit high considering he may not fully commit to walking every day, so have decided to set him up with a basic OG account. 

I thought this was the easy option, but as an android user didnt realise how complicated the iOS version might be, with not being able to use the marketplace in app.


My questions are:

1. If I was to create an account for him (on my android) would it be a simple proccess to log in on his iPhone and start earning? 

2. Do you earn GST the same on iOS as android.. for example could he use the GST to level up shoes, open MB and burn gems? 

3. Does iOS still allow you to transfer from spending wallet to crypto wallet in app? Could he swap his GST to Solana in app for example, like in the android version? 

4. I understand to buy sneakers he can log into the website marketplace. When he buys a sneaker can he use GMT in spending/ will the nft appear in spending? And is this the same with gems/ scrolls? 

Thanks for your help fam!! 🙂"
I made a StepnGO earnings calculator,StepN,1hpjt9j,2024-12-30 04:44:30,15,0.94,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1hpjt9j/i_made_a_stepngo_earnings_calculator/,dev_omr,,"Hey community,

I just published a StepnGO earnings calculator which I implemented in the last few days - stepngo\[.\]club

What it can do:

👉 calculate **estimated** GGT earnings depending on a sneaker configuration, daily energy cap and fitness level

👉 shows the current prices of GGT, GMT and POL (prices are updated every 10 minutes)

👉 convert token prices USDC <-> GGT <-> GMT <-> POL

👉 switch to light / dark theme 😁

Let me know your feedback about it and if you have other suggestions what can be useful to add, because I'm planning to develop further.

Thanks 🙏"

I think the game is facing an issue with its earning mechanism. 

Players earn more from GST instead of GMT even of you hold GMT until it goes up to $0.30. 

I do not want the game to die but I feel like people mainly cash out when GST has a spike.

So, when will the time come again that players will hold their GST and GMT again?

Will we make it to 1 billion users one day? 
(5 to 10 years)

I mean BTC is at its OTH but STEPN is not going up with it. 

I wished it would and stay stable at $0.50 and 0.03 GST. 

Merry Christmas STEPN Community!! 🎄🎁

What is your thoughts on the future of GMT, GST earning/prices and community growth?"

"Well, tried to add some ""fun"" to my OG STEPN. This is what happened ",StepN,1hgb623,2024-12-17 08:57:13,23,0.93,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1hgb623/well_tried_to_add_some_fun_to_my_og_stepn_this_is/,aleuiia,,"Hello there, I'm an ""OG STEPN"" player since June 2021, and thanks to my strategy that was literaly swapping every GST i had into SOL, I was able to get my initial investment out of the app. It took me almost 2 years to reach that, and I was pretty happy but at the same time, I stopped being consistent in using the app, even though ""I could make money while walking""

This is sadly because the app itself has nothing. No leaderboards, no social interractions, and most of the times the events are raffles (so you gotta be lucky) or gem or sneakers enhancements.

I'm a 10-energy player, I've never enhanced sneakers because I just don't have enough to do so.

So, after several months without having much interest in the app, I decided to add some fun and buy a Rare (I had always been using an Uncommon) and as I had started being more consistent in outdoor running, I decided to go for a Runner. A Rare Runner. 

I took 1 SOL (142$ at the time) and I swapped it into 1300 GMT, that I used to buy a Rare ELCE Runner.

Bought at LV1, and upgraded up to LV20 to unclock all 4 sockets.

Shoe's Base Stats and Gem Sockets :

* Efficiency : 27.2 , 1 ""normal"" socket and 1 level 2 socket 
* Luck : 30.0 , 1 ""normal"" socket
* Comfort : 30.0, 1 Level 2 socket
* Resilience : 33.5

Didn't buy any new gems, I used the LV4 Efficiency and Luck Gems that I already had. 

I could now be able to have 35-mins runs and get MB4's (I had 5 energy before buying that one) and I estimated the time to get my investment back at **9 months**. 

And I would say that I got lucky, because thanks to the same strategy (swapping into SOL) I made my investment back in **4 months** ! 

Yup, Thanks to the gems and the GST earned, and due to SOL surge, I reached 150$ in 3 months ! :D



So yeah, the app is still relevant (for now) but lacks some fresh design, interactions like leaderboards (i truely don't understand how it's not implemented yet, since the runs aren't stored in the blockchain, I guess). The app feels dead but there's still something you can do. I don't think that I'll retry the experiment anytime soon. 

  
That's it, thank you !"

What Would You Do?,StepN,1h08k0b,2024-11-26 05:11:46,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1h08k0b/what_would_you_do/,PhraseOk36,,"This is just an open discussion strategy for my case. You don't have the obligation to answer but I'd like to hear your thought on your best case strategy. I know this is personal, but I just like discussing strategy as a gamer myself. So take it as a showcase of your problem solving and let's discuss it here. I'm using stepn side kick to confirm as well

Case:
- 13 energy 
- main GST earner is lv 30 with EELL socket
- base stat for ELCR: 18.3, 13.2, 16.3, 14.6
- current gems: 3E x 2, 3L x 2
- around 185GST earning/day

What would you think the best strategy aside from running everyday, any idea to improve the earning with minimal investment?

I have few options in mind with additional investmet but would like to hear y'all thoughts:

1. Upgrade to a lv 5 E gem, boost the earning to 300GST

2. Buy rare shoes with 2E socket, keep using lv 3 E gem

3. Buy epic shoes with ECCL socket, use lv 3 gem still and slowly use the earned GST to upgrade gem to lv 5

4. No need to upgrade, it's already the most optimal. Which I think is not true since the cap is still up to 300

5. Find another GMT earner shoe and start focusing on GMT. But i think this last option will not be worth it and too expensive.

Please share your thought and analysis. What would you do? On the first glance, investments on gems seem more profitable then new shoes. Or maybe should I burn the common shoes to get UC, then burn 5 UCs into 1 epic?"

🔹 GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS(™) Partnership

# **GMT DAO**  🎉

🔹 GMT DAO will be an independent community organization of GMT holders

🔹 Main goal is to empower the community to govern GMT decisions through voting.

🔹 Visit http://burngmt.com to lock tokens, vote, and decide on GMT burns (live soon).

🔹 Voters earn the #MGGA NFT, which makes them eligible for GMT airdrops from a 100M GMT pool.

🔹 Locking is temporary—tokens unlock after 60 days, and voters can rejoin the next cycle.

🔹 The DAO objective is to burn up to 600M GMT, decided entirely by the community.

🔹 Users will have the option to lock GMT and continue to earn rewards for further voting cycles as well.

This is a huge step for decentralization and community-driven governance!

# **STEPN GO Sneaker Sales Pause** ⏸️

🔹 STEPN GO is pausing all official Sneaker (including Genesis) sales for 6 months to create a more balanced, sustainable ecosystem.

🔹 This includes Raffle Mints and all other forms of official sales (but no worries, we’ll still do cool giveaways!)

We listened to the community, and this decision reflects your feedback!

So I’ve been getting into STEPN recently on my iPhone and just discovered the whole spark mechanic. But here’s something that’s been bugging me: when I check the value, the spark price in USD seems to be higher than just buying with GMT. Is this normal, or am I missing something here?

I’m wondering if there are hidden fees (like trx fees or other stuff) that could balance out the difference and make the values match up. Anyone here using spark regularly who can share some insights?"

* **The SEC has approved Nasdaq's request to list and trade options on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF:** The decision introduces new hedging tools for investors but comes with a 25,000 contract limit which has been criticized by the exchange as “conservative.”
* **Crypto investment products saw a second consecutive week of inflows, totaling $321 million, after the Fed's decision to cut rates:** Bitcoin investment products led the pack with $284 million in inflows last week.
* **More than 40 Republican lawmakers called on SEC chair Gary Gensler to withdraw the crypto custody rule (SAB 121):** They argue the rule increases consumer risk and stifles innovation.
* **Caroline Ellison, ex-CEO of Alameda Research, was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the FTX fraud case:** Despite her cooperation with law enforcement in the case against Sam Bankman-Fried, the judge ruled that Ellison must still serve time.
* **On Monday, OpenAI’s official news account on X was compromised, with hackers using it to promote a fake ""$OPENAI"" token:** The fraudulent post claimed the token would grant access to future beta programs and directed victims to a spoof website.
* **PayPal to accept crypto payments:** Payments giant PayPal announced Wednesday it would allow business accounts to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.

🔹 STEPN GO Beta testing
🔹 Haus System insights
🔹 STEPN GO Roadmap
🔹 #STEPNEMBER3 - ALPHA ALERT 🚨
🔹 G-SHOCK Partnership highlights
🔹 Upcoming offline events
🔹 Morchi updates

Let’s dive in! 🤿

STEPN GO Beta Test 🎮
🔹 STEPN GO is officially open to the public—a key milestone for us!
🔹 Everyone can now enter the game with an Activation Code and buy Sneakers from the marketplace once they’ve finished their onboarding process
🔹 You can swap GGT safely using your #FSLID—more details on @FSLweb3
🔹 STEPN GO is designed with Web3 social elements in mind, though it doesn’t offer direct financial incentives from social activities like Social-Fi

We’re now ready to onboard as many people as possible ✨

Haus System Insights 🏠
🔹 The Haus will always be the only gateway to STEPN GO—ensuring seamless onboarding for new players
🔹 We want to make sure the app grows healthily, which is the reason we implemented the Haus
🔹 You have to complete in-app tasks to become a Host, including burning Sneakers and using Energy
🔹 Thanks to The Haus, new players can join with just an Activation Code—no wallet or Web3 knowledge needed!
🔹 As more Sneakers are minted and shared with Guests, Activation Codes will be more frequent, making it easier for everyone to join and become Hosts themselves (this is already happening)
🔹 We are also giving away Activation Codes on our X, and we’ve launched a dedicated channel on STEPN GO Discord for Activation Code sharing—link in bio

Our main objective is still breaking the entry barrier for web2 users to join web3 products, and we’re committed to it. Haus and FSL ID are just the start 💪

STEPN GO Roadmap 🎯
🔹 We are actively working on debugging and enhancing the overall user experience
🔹 Left and right foot Sneaker minting will be reinstated in a future update, but the release date is still pending and will take some time
🔹 Updates to the FSL ID interface are underway to make it more user-friendly, especially for its DEX functionality. We’re also planning to integrate FSL ID more closely with STEPN GO
🔹 Currently, there are no plans to release the Uncommon Sneakers and Mystery Box system, as our primary focus is making user onboarding easier
🔹 Features like ""Quest for Guest"" are being developed to help new users kickstart their STEPN GO journey more smoothly

#STEPNEMBER3 SPOILER 🎂 (Jerry, don’t read this!)
🔹 We have an in-app event starting next week
🔹 100,000 GMT prize pool and many more STEPN assets
🔹 Complete 4 different tasks to enter the final raffle

Details coming soon 👀

G-SHOCK Partnership Highlights ⌚
🔹 We’ve partnered with @GSHOCK_OFFICIAL, the famous CASIO’s watch brand
🔹 800 STEPN GO x G-SHOCK Genesis Sneakers were raffled on MOOAR
🔹 A record-breaking 170,650,000 GMT has been locked in the raffle 🏆

This was our first partnership for STEPN GO—and it’s just the beginning. Stay tuned for our next big announcement!

Community Questions 🙋

Q: Can Guests access the marketplace and buy Sneakers?

A: Yes, but they cannot use them until they complete a full Guest cycle (2-4 weeks).

Q: Will STEPN GO Sneakers and Shoeboxes be tradable on MOOAR?

A: No, they will remain exclusive to the STEPN marketplace, except for Genesis Sneakers.

Q: When do you plan to implement Uncommon Sneakers?

A: No current plans, but we’ll proceed with development on Uncommon Sneakers, Mystery Boxes, Raw Stones, and Gems.

Q: Will there be a feature to communicate with Guests in STEPN GO?

A: We hope Hosts and Guests are real-life friends or family. We’re considering building a Haus report feature to give Hosts insight into Guest performance.

Q: Will there be a Genesis filter added to the marketplace?

A: Yes, it’s in the works.

Q: What has been the most notable feedback from the Alpha Testing?

A: One suggestion was to double the time required to complete 4 Energy to prevent Hosts from giving codes to themselves. While creative, we’re monitoring behaviour before making changes.

Q: Does STEPN GO plan to support smartwatches?

A: Yes, smartwatch support is on the roadmap. (omg)

Q: Any plans for perks based on the number of Energy shared by Hosts?

A: No plans at the moment.

Q: How many cups of coffee do you drink at each meeting?

A: About 2—one espresso and one latte.

Q: Yawn, did you enjoy WebX, FSL Night, MUSIC Crypto Fest, Osaka Castle Move, and Osaka Night?

A: Yes, but I definitely need to lose some weight after all the drinking! 😅

That’s a 🌮 on our September Townhall!

Thanks for reading, and happy #STEPNEMBER3 everyone 💚"
An unlikely theory....,StepN,1ffirz2,2024-09-12 21:20:36,11,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1ffirz2/an_unlikely_theory/,iainniai,,"Okay so we all know that the stepn Devs are yet to release the utility for resistance gems in the OGStepn. Well I am wondering if the use case will be GGT earning. 

In principle it could work like GMT earning where the supply can be controlled to prevent oversupply. 

I'm not really basing this on anything substantial but I have noticed that the GGT icon has a purple circle around it 😅

Anyways I have stocked up on a resistance earner and gems just incase. Let me know what you guys think. "

Community Questions ❓

Q: What type of Sneaker will the Alpha Draw have, will they all be Trainers?
A: No, the Sneaker types will be determined randomly.

Q: What are the plans to avoid Mint farms?
A: Mint farming happens because of centralisation and lack of initial supply. However, in STEPN GO, the Alpha Draw Sneakers are soul-bound, making it impossible to trade them.
Plus, there will be an unsellable Mint Quota required to Mint, which can only be obtained by using Energy. Finally, we’ll ensure initial liquidity to guarantee a minimum supply.

Q: How long will the Alpha testing last?
A: 1 month, unless we need to extend it.

Q: How many people will be playing in the Alpha Test?
A: From 2,000 to 2,500 players.

Q: What will the next phase be after the Alpha Testing?
A: We will next launch the Beta version, including a marketplace and a DEX.

From crypto NFT to real sneakers: My unexpected STEPN experience,StepN,1e2vyq9,2024-07-14 02:59:50,21,0.97,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1e2vyq9/from_crypto_nft_to_real_sneakers_my_unexpected/,Express-Natural5274,,"Dear Stepn community,
I would like to share my almost 2-year-long story with the game. I believe that it can be inspiring not only for the community but also for the developers, as your game had a great impact on my wellbeing. I am a senior player but by no means an OG or whale. I just have a few uncommons, 9 shoes in total, with 13 energy and around 220 GST per day. As you will see, it took me a long time to get there.

Let me unfold my story. I joined Stepn in October 2022, just shortly before the FTX collapse. I bought a common shoe for around 50 euros. I was not ready to invest heavily in the app so I just played around. I was lucky that I did not because the value fell significantly and the whole crypto market was bottoming out. I used to run to work every day, 2x4km, and obviously with 2 energy, I did not earn much. However, the game somehow sweetened my everyday commute.
For my Christmas gift, I bought an EEER uncommon runner for 150 euros. This was quite a heavy investment into a crypto NFT, at least to my standards. At that time, I had no gems and thanks to double GST earning, I was able to earn for my third common shoe to increase my energy from 2 to 5. I was lucky to buy the shoe at the all-time low for 10 bucks. Those were really uncertain times not only for Stepn but for crypto in general. I remember the transition from SOL to GMT as the primary cryptocurrency and I wondered whether Solana and the project would survive.

I had never used to run every day but Stepn motivated me to be active even though the earnings were negligible. My daily routine consisted of running 5km 7 days a week. I bought some low-level E gems from my earnings and planned my next strategy. Everything changed in June 2023 when a rather rare medical condition suddenly tied me to bed. I had to use crutches for 3 months and I was learning to walk for another 2. It took me 6 months to recover to the point that I could walk in a normal pace. Then an idea came to my mind that I could use Stepn to motivate me to walk more. I bought an EEEL UC jogger for another 150 euros and for a Christmas gift, I wished a L4 E gem. My physiotherapy went well thanks to my everyday walking workouts. Since I could not run yet, I compensated this with longer walks. In March 2024, when the GST price suddenly spiked, I was able to purchase more UC and ended up with 13 energy and another L4 E gem.

This 13 energy cap had an interesting effect on me. Looking back on the statistics, I realized that I planned my day to spend my daily energy cap and ended up being more active than I ever used to. I also managed to sell some GST for a reasonable price and funnily enough, I turned my earnings from NFT sneakers into real sneakers that I purchased. My condition does not allow me to use just any footwear so I had to carefully select the proper model. I bought one pair of running shoes, one pair of walking shoes, and one pair of Oofos slippers that help me alleviate the pressure on my metatarsal bone. So technically, I cannot say that I ever ROI-ed but the fact that I turned my profit into real shoes could be considered that I am even.

Now I must admit that I am totally hooked into the app and still plan my day accordingly. I am well over the greed about ROI or profit; I just love the app. It has become a part of my life and a great motivation for fitness. When I look back to 2022, I don’t know what would ever motivate a person to run on a running trail at 1 degree Celsius every morning, so well played, Stepn, well played :) This aspect of the game should be more promoted because it is often overlooked. Our community used it often to justify not quitting the game in the midst of the toughest bear market but I feel that the tide turns again to ROI, greed, and earning aspects of the game.

I owe you my sincere thanks for helping me stay active and I would also like to thank the Stepn community here on Reddit for keeping the good vibes even in uncertain crypto times.

Finally, I would like to make three predictions to share my observations of Stepn over the last two years. You may not agree but maybe it will spark an interesting discussion within the community.

1) GST won’t pump significantly higher than 0.15-0.20. Reason: Too many players are already focused on GST atm. GST spiked significantly because most people were interested in earning GMT, sold their GST stack too early, and GST was completely overlooked as an earning strategy (check the comments from 6 months ago that mostly recommended swapping GST to GMT or Solana). People are now aware of the GST potential to make another significant pump and are planning accordingly. Hence, I predict that as a result, GMT will overperform GST on the GST/GMT chart at the peak of the bull run (if a bull run ever comes :)).

2) I am not planning to join Stepn GO because I believe that the ruffle idea is inherently bad. We already have other competitive apps that focus on the social element and their only utility is just ruffles or pure speculation on token price (cannot list them here on Reddit). I am worried that Stepn GO was a step in the wrong direction.

3) Stepn has a potential to outperform competitive apps in game dynamics if a novel solution to resilience gems is introduced that could work as a stabilizing factor against market manipulation (no idea how that could happen, though :))."

Why STEPN GO is a new gem in crypto?,StepN,1e1d41m,2024-07-12 05:08:28,0,0.33,5,https://i.redd.it/b769a3pg02cd1.jpeg,Popular-Fold1664,,"ONBOARDING? 

Do you remember the hype when STEPN first launched? So many people from web2 joined crypto after learning about STEPN. But it was and still is difficult for regular people to start using STEPN, to create a CEX account, learn about crypto coins and exchange rates, to make a wallet and never share your seed phrase. 

This time around we are looking forward to see millions of people joining new project. Why? It will be easy. An active user can invite a friend and give him a sneaker by simply sharing an activation code. No need to create a wallet, to buy and send coins for gas, to figure out spending-wallet system. In STEPN GO onboarding process can take as little as 2 minutes and a new player is ready to use the app and earn. 


COMMUNITY 

We all know how community aspect is important in web3. All those fancy blue chip projects are nothing without its loyal fandom. In STEPN GO users will be able to interact in the app. Using Interactive Map one can see people walking with STEPN GO nearby and offer them to meet in real life. Or simply chat in the app with no need to go to social media seeking like-minded individuals.

ROBUST ECONOMY 

This time around developers learned from their past mistakes. No more nft inflation. Sneakers will be burned every day for energy. Users start with 0 Energy, and it  doesn't automatically renew. Players should acquire energy by burning their sneakers. 

The new in-game token GGT will not be listed on any exchange, which should save it from speculation.

FSL ecosystem token GMT will be also used in the app. This coin is already native for STEPN, GAS HERO and MOOAR. GMT’s utility growing every month with more and more projects(such as Helios and Famous Fox) using it in their ecosystems. With additional utility for GMT with a new app launch this coin has good potential in the future. Moreover, 7 million GMT was already locked in STEPN GO raffle for 4 years. "
How sneaker new attributes work in STEPN-GO,StepN,1e0lsug,2024-07-11 06:37:12,2,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1e0lsug/how_sneaker_new_attributes_work_in_stepngo/,purpletentacIe,,"In STEPN GO, sneakers are essential NFT assets with various attributes that determine a player's ability to earn rewards through physical activities like walking, jogging, and running. Here's an in-depth look at how these attributes work and affect gameplay.

# Efficiency

Efficiency is a critical attribute impacting the amount of GO GAME TOKEN (GGT) you earn. Higher efficiency means more GGT for the energy you spend during your physical activities. However, once you hit the daily earning cap, you will no longer earn additional GGT for that day. This attribute is especially important for players focusing on maximizing their token earnings from their activities​

# Luck

Luck affects the chances of receiving Mystery Boxes, which contain Raw Stones used for enhancing sneakers and other in-game items. Only sneakers of ""Uncommon"" quality or higher have a luck attribute. The higher your luck and the more energy you spend in a session, the better your chances of receiving higher-level Mystery Boxes with more valuable contents. It's important to note that you won't receive Mystery Boxes if your MB slots are full​

# Charm

Charm is tied to earning Outfit Fragments, which can be assembled into different outfits. These outfits not only serve as a status symbol within the game but can also be shown off on the interactive map and social media. Like luck, only ""Uncommon"" or higher quality sneakers have a charm attribute. Higher charm increases the drop rate of Outfit Fragments during activities. Special visual effects for rare and legendary outfits enhance their appeal both in STEPN GO and on FSL's future social platform, The MoonBase​

# Karma

Karma plays a role in PvP earnings, allowing players to earn GMT from the Schadenfreude Pool. Sneakers need to be ""Uncommon"" quality or higher to possess a karma value. Higher karma, combined with more energy spent, increases the likelihood of earning a portion of the pool. However, these earnings are based on leaderboard standings updated every 24 hours, not immediately after each session. Only players who rank above a certain threshold are eligible for these rewards​

# Earning Toggle

One of the unique aspects of STEPN GO is the Earning Toggle feature. Players can only earn one type of reward per session, which they select based on their desired attribute: Efficiency (GGT), Luck (Mystery Box), Charm (Outfit Fragment), or Karma (GMT from Schadenfreude Pool). This allows players to strategize and focus their efforts based on their immediate goals and the attributes of their sneakers​

# Additional Details on Sneaker Characteristics

# Types of Sneakers

There are four main types of sneakers, each with an optimal speed range that affects their return rate:

* **Walker**: Optimal speed of 1-6 km/hr, with a 90% return rate.
* **Jogger**: Optimal speed of 4-10 km/hr, with a 95% return rate.
* **Runner**: Optimal speed of 8-20 km/hr, with a 100% return rate.
* **Trainer**: Optimal speed of 1-20 km/hr, with a randomized return rate of 90% to 110%​

# Quality and Levels

Sneakers come in different qualities (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary), with higher quality sneakers having more attribute points and higher level caps. For example, Common sneakers can level up to 20, while Legendary sneakers can reach level 60. As sneakers level up, they gain additional attribute points, enhancing their overall performance. Higher quality sneakers also unlock additional perks and sockets at certain levels, allowing further customization and enhancement​

# Minting

Minting is the process of creating a new sneaker using two existing ones. Each sneaker can mint up to seven times, and the cost in GGT increases with each subsequent mint. The quality and type of the new sneaker are influenced by the parent sneakers, and there's a chance to receive a double mint, resulting in an extra shoe box. This shoe box must be opened to reveal the new sneaker, with its quality and attributes determined by the parent sneakers​

In this article, I am going to talk about **STEPN GO** - The new FSL product, what is this and how to play.

Basically, **STEPN GO** is a project with similar mechanisms to **STEPN OG** - Where users can buy sneakers, move and earn tokens, mystery boxes,... However, because **STEPN OG** is a Web3 project that has been around for a long time, so it will be difficult for Web2 users or users new to cryptocurrency to understand and catch up.

Bringing **STEPN OG**'s mechanics along with improvements, the FSL team created **STEPN GO**. This promises to be a simple application, aimed at Web2 users, taking them step by step to Web3, to STEPN and to the entire FSL ecosystem.

To learn more about the **STEPN GO** project, please visit [https://go-whitepaper.stepn.com](https://go-whitepaper.stepn.com)

The project is currently in the **Alpha Draw** phase. Users can purchase tickets to attend the lottery by locking GMT tokens. To participate in this phase, please download **STEPN GO**.

Ways to send pGMT to your STEPN GO account,StepN,1dxnk3e,2024-07-07 14:41:11,2,0.75,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1dxnk3e/ways_to_send_pgmt_to_your_stepn_go_account/,purpletentacIe,,"# Method 1: Centralized Exchange (CEX)

1. **Find a Suitable Exchange:**
   * Choose a reputable centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance that supports Polygon GMT.
2. **Deposit Tokens:**
   * Send your tokens from your wallet to your CEX account using the appropriate network (e.g., Ethereum for ERC-20 tokens, Solana for SPL tokens).
3. **Trade for GMT:**
   * Once your tokens are in the CEX account, trade them for GMT tokens. At this stage, you don't need to specifically choose Polygon GMT.
4. **Withdraw GMT to Polygon Wallet:**
   * Withdraw the GMT tokens from the exchange to your STEPN GO Polygon account using the Polygon network. Enter your STEPN GO Polygon wallet address as the withdrawal destination.

# Method 2: Swap in a Polygon Wallet

1. **Use a Polygon-Compatible Wallet:**
   * Utilize a Polygon-compatible wallet such as Phantom or MetaMask configured for the Polygon network.
2. **Swap Tokens to pGMT:**
   * If you already have Polygon tokens in your wallet, swap them directly to pGMT tokens using a decentralized exchange (DEX) like QuickSwap or SushiSwap on the Polygon network or the builtin swap service in the wallet itself.
3. **Send pGMT to STEPN GO Account:**
   * After swapping to pGMT tokens, initiate a transfer from your wallet to your STEPN GO Polygon account. Enter your STEPN GO Polygon wallet address as the recipient.

# Method 3: Bridge

1. **Choose a Reliable Bridge:**
   * Select a trustworthy bridge service that supports the tokens you want to bridge and operates officially on Polygon.
2. **Connect Source and Target Wallets:**
   * Connect your source wallet (where your tokens currently reside) and your target Polygon wallet  to the bridge interface.
3. **Bridge Tokens:**
   * Initiate the bridging process on the bridge interface. Follow the instructions to bridge your tokens from the source blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to the Polygon network.
4. **Receive Tokens on Polygon:**
   * Once the bridging process is completed, you will receive the bridged tokens on your Polygon wallet. Confirm the receipt in your STEPN GO Polygon account using a Polygon blockchain explorer.
5. **Send Tokens to STEPN GO Account:**
   * Finally, send the GMT (now on Polygon) from your wallet to your STEPN GO Polygon account. Use your STEPN GO Polygon wallet address as the recipient.

# General Tips:

* **Transaction Fees:** Expect fees for each transaction (deposit, trade, withdrawal, swap, bridge). Check fee schedules on the respective platforms.
* **Verification:** Always double-check wallet addresses and websites to ensure they are correct and secure.
* **Caution:** This information is for educational purposes only. Conduct your own research and exercise caution when handling cryptocurrencies.

By following these structured methods, you can effectively swap tokens to pGMT and send them to your STEPN GO Polygon account using different platforms and tools available within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Read on to learn everything, and join our Discord to avoid missing the next ones: discord.gg/stepngo 

Let’s dive in 👇

Q1: Can STEPN GO surpass STEPN?

A: Initially, we planned to add new features to STEPN, but due to complexity, we created STEPN GO. STEPN GO simplifies login, optimises gas fees, and addresses game asset inflation with a redesigned economic system and Haus system for increased user engagement.

Q2: Will STEPN be abandoned if STEPN GO succeeds?

A: No, STEPN’s original model remains unchanged. STEPN GO’s success will benefit STEPN without altering its core.

Q3: Can users use both STEPN and STEPN GO simultaneously?

A: We didn’t set any technical restrictions.

Q4: How is STEPN GO addressing network congestion issues seen in STEPN?

A: Extensive technical optimisations have been implemented to improve user experience.

Q5: Is STEPN GO a fully decentralised game?

A: Yes, but with measures to prevent cheating.

Q6: What role does GGT play in STEPN GO’s economy?

A: GGT functions similarly to sneakers or outfits, balancing the economy by generating and consuming GGT.

Q7: Can users design their Avatars and Outfits or collaborate with big IPs?

A: Yes, users can design their Avatars, and there are plans for high-quality collaborations with well-known IPs.

Q8: Can Outfits in STEPN GO be traded like game skins?

A: Only certain Outfits, specifically sets, can be traded.

Q9: Can STEPN GO be used on treadmills or indoors?

A: No, effective anti-cheat measures for indoor use are not yet available.

Q10: How will STEPN GO attract running enthusiasts?

A: By integrating social features and making the game accessible without requiring Web3 knowledge (be a guest in the Haus system).

Q11: How can users obtain Genesis Sneakers in STEPN GO?

A: We’ll release Genesis Sneakers through promotional partnerships.

Q12: Can GMT and GGT be converted, and can Sneakers be bought during the Alpha test?

A: No conversion or trading during the Alpha Test; these features will be available in Beta.

Q13: How many Sneakers will be available during the Alpha test?

A: Between 6,000-8,000 Sneakers for 2,000-3,000 users.

Q14: Will the Sneakers won from the Alpha Draw be differentiated by left and right?

A: It won’t happen that all 3 Sneakers are on the same side.

Q15: Will STEPN GO have VIP subscription features like STEPN?

A: There are no current plans for VIP subscriptions.

Q16: Will STEPN GO have a chat feature?

A: Yes, text-based chat will be available.

Q17: Will there be high-end Sneakers like Rainbow Sneakers in STEPN GO?

A: No, there are no plans for such features.

Q18: Will cheating by Haus Hosts or Guests affect others?

A: Cheating by one party will not affect others.

Q19: Can Guests only get Common quality Sneakers? Does the condition of the Host affect the Guest?

A: Guests only receive Common Sneakers, and the Host’s condition does not affect the Guests’ earnings.

Q20: As the Haus system controls the minting quota, does it mean that users can’t mint during the Alpha test?

A: Haus only shows the minting quota; it doesn’t control the minting quota.

Q21: Does the shake-to-match feature find nearby players?

A: The shake-to-match is a non-local social feature allowing users to connect and share running information without revealing personal data.

Q22: Will there be diverse exercise modes like jump rope or cycling?

A: Currently, there are no plans to add other exercise modes due to anti-cheat challenges.

Q23: Why is the draw ticket price set at 5 GMT for 2 tickets, and is the result verifiable on-chain?

A: To make participation affordable, enhance user experience, and increase winning chances. Yes, results are verifiable on-chain."

Blockchain Gaming 2024: A Year of Innovation and Evolving Experiences,BlockchainGame,1dd87u0,2024-06-11 03:20:27,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainGame/comments/1dd87u0/blockchain_gaming_2024_a_year_of_innovation_and/,YogurtclosetTall2558,,"The year 2024 has witnessed a significant evolution in the realm of blockchain gaming.  This exciting space is no longer a niche market, but a rapidly growing industry brimming with innovation and diverse projects.  Blockchain technology's ability to create secure, transparent, and user-owned experiences is fundamentally changing the way gamers interact with games and potentially even earn rewards.

Several innovative projects are leading the charge in 2024. Here are a few examples that showcase the breadth and potential of blockchain gaming:

* Play-to-Earn (P2E) Model Continues to Thrive:  Established titles like Axie Infinity (AXS), with its loyal player base and thriving in-game economy built around unique digital pets (Axies), remain prominent examples of the P2E model's success. Players can breed, raise, battle, and even trade their Axies, potentially generating income through gameplay.

* Metaverse Integration:  The concept of metaverses, expansive virtual worlds with user-generated content and economies, is gaining significant traction. Platforms like The Sandbox allow players to create their own experiences within a shared metaverse, fostering a sense of community ownership and creativity. This integration of blockchain and metaverses could revolutionize how players interact with virtual worlds.

* Move-to-Earn (M2E) Takes Center Stage:  STEPN (GMT) introduces a novel concept with its ""move-to-earn"" approach.  This innovative platform incentivizes fitness by rewarding users with cryptocurrency for walking and running in the real world.  This gamified approach to fitness could have a significant impact on promoting healthier lifestyles.

* Fantasy Sports Gets a Blockchain Upgrade: Platforms like GameOn are pioneering the integration of blockchain technology within fantasy sports.  Let's delve deeper into how GameOn leverages this technology to create a unique and potentially rewarding experience for sports fans. The platform utilizes the GAME token, a utility token that facilitates enhanced gameplay features and rewards users for community participation through the GPTS (GameOn Points) Campaign. Early adopters holding the LaLiga War Chest NFT receive additional benefits, highlighting the platform's integration of NFTs and potential advantages for early engagement.

* Strategic Partnerships: GameOn boasts impressive collaborations with established sports leagues, including LaLiga (soccer) and the PFL (MMA). These partnerships provide users with access to renowned athletes and real-world player stats, enhancing the overall immersion and connection to their favorite sports.

* GameOn is actively developing an interoperable gaming ecosystem. This means users could potentially switch seamlessly between different fantasy sports titles within the platform, while also having the potential to earn rewards across various leagues. This focus on interoperability and a connected ecosystem could be a major draw for dedicated fans who enjoy managing multiple fantasy teams across different sports.

Do you see potential benefits in decentralization, global accessibility, and user rewards compared to traditional platforms?"
Odd wallet behaviour ,StepN,1d83vnb,2024-06-04 14:10:42,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1d83vnb/odd_wallet_behaviour/,Defiant_Ad6083,,"Hey all,

So recently my wallet would not receive any token or anything from my Phantom or Coinbase wallet. Confirmed the correct wallet address however in my Stepn wallet there is no activity on any token.

Fast forward to reaching out to tech support. Basically, they said my wallet has been compromised. On solscan they can see directly after a Stepn wallet funding, the funds were instantly transferred out to another wallet.

I can view this wallet on solscan and it says it is a system program holder. It has 600 plus token and 7000+ transfers. I can see my received GMT and SOL in there from my Stepn wallet.

What the heck is happening?! Because I don't ever see those funds in the Stepn wallet and there is no activity to suggest they ever hit the Stepn wallet.

Thoughts?! No slight on Stepn. But curious if anyone has ever seen this issue before. Especially because I can view that wallet holding MY crypto!!

1- Of course this one we have all of us, the price of gst will declive one time stepn go is running, so the trick will be to earn gmt, right?

2- I would like to use stepn go but I don't want to see the same happens to stepn in first days, paying for sneaker like 1k and then one year later the same shoe you can buy it for 100 or less. ¿how we can do to diference people who want to play it to just speculators, is like the same with adidas sneakers, it was just for speculators, I know crypto world is like this, but project like stepn has to create something to keep speculative people out. 

3- Do you know if will be posible to play stepn and stepn go in the same time? this could be the best thing happens to us

by the way sorry for my english"
StepN Strategies After StepN Go announcement ,StepN,1d22odo,2024-05-27 17:21:54,18,0.89,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1d22odo/stepn_strategies_after_stepn_go_announcement/,bundabandit189,,"I regularly read StepN threads and created this one because I wanted to start a conversation which may benefit many of us moving forwards. I'm curious about the strategies you guys are pursuing since the announcement of StepN Go.

  
THIS IF NOT FUD! I believe StepN will continue to have life and utility since it'll generate GMT. But I think it's purpose may shift to fueling StepN Go adventures instead of being an independent money making app

Through sheer serendipity, I sold all my StepN shoes/gems two days before the StepN go announcement. I was able to cash my gmt out with a nice little boost from the recent bump in GMT price.

Rationale: GMT has a history of crashing in the summer. The summer of 2022 and 2023 saw GMT bottom out. I expect this summer to be similar as I don't anticipate a US interest rate cut this summer (possibly September but we'll see). Before the StepN Go announcement I had simply planned to cash out, wait for GMT to bleed, and then return and scoop up shoes/gems at deeply reduced prices as people panic sold (I'm not a whale trust me I'm only working with roughly $5000)

However, the announcement of StepN Go changed the minds of many people, evident by the falling shoe and gem prices. I know many users are selling their StepN assets to prepare for a huge run at StepN Go. I've also seen the Genesis shoe market explode in recent days and certainly that is due to some StepN Go related shoe benefit. I considered this but the new floor prices of 20000 GMT for a piece of junk shoe doesn't seem like a good move.

Personally, I'm going to wait for GMT to take its regular summer dip and purchase maybe $5000 worth. After that, I'll wait until the first possible moment to enter StepN Go. I thought about shifting to a GMT set up on StepN but after hours of calculations I don't see where this is beneficial in the short term. A great GMT set up could easily run over 20000 GMT and the amount of time needed to walk to earn 20000 GMT may be roughly a year. The way I see it, that's money that could have been invested in StepN Go from the start. If shoe/gem prices drop DRAMATICALLY I may revisit this thinking but for now I'm set on preparing to buy GMT this summer and wait to enter StepN Go.

Again, curious what strategies other users will pursue over the summer. Are people changing their StepN shoes to prepare for GMT earning? Are people cashing out to prepare to enter StepN Go? Are people staying the course? 

I would think we're ALL adults here and we can discuss our strategies with respect and decorum but it's the internet and I'm probably sadly mistaken lol. Anyways, I'm hoping to generate a discussion amongst users where we can all learn a thing or two.

Thanks

"Stepn GO: The Good, The Bad, & The Confusing",StepN,1cz7al5,2024-05-23 19:48:28,14,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1cz7al5/stepn_go_the_good_the_bad_the_confusing/,Educational_Art_6028,,"Wow! What a day! Have we all calmed down yet, or still in a flaming rage? First off, I have not read all of the Stepn GO Whitepaper. I'm really not interested in playing it. It sounds like a ""kids bop"" version of Stepn, and I think that's the point - Make it easier to appeal to a wider audience. Here's a good [comparison](https://www.entroducing.com/view/stepn-go-and-stepn-og-comparison) of the two apps.

Let first address the elephant in the room.

The Bad: Changing their X logo to ""Stepn GO"" was a horrible move. No excuses for this level of incompetency. I get that building a new audience is a pain, but damn that was a bad move. They should have done named it Stepn Official (or just Stepn), upload an all encompassing logo and call it a day. These two apps can live under the same umbrella, but it's not a good look funneling all of the communication from one of the app names, and not the over-arching company. It sent the wrong message, and confused the heck out of everyone. They needed to change their logo and name on X for some time now, but not to a new app name. So stupid.

The Good: Here is what I think is good about Stepn GO. Despite having zero interest in this game, during the townhall they mentioned a big problem with Stepn, and that is it's too confusing for most people to adopt. IDK if Stepn GO will be less confusing as it sounds like the same game, but with more social elements. I'll reserve judgement, but if they solve that problem and are able to on-board millions of new users with more ease then it could funnel people into Stepn OG. We've all been conditioned to think that Stepn OG should funnel to other games, but this is wrong. It is simple too esoteric for most people to grasp. On the contrary, if millions of new users get on board with Stepn GO, and they are incentivized to burn GMT, or better yet, they might want to play Stepn OG to earn GMT. Ultimately, it should benefit Stepn OG ecosystem.

The Confusing: There's a lot to unpack here, from the game play to the X logo change, to the new GGT token. Why aren't they using GST? Probably because people won't be earning a huge amount, and a 2 cent token isn't going to move the needle for this game. Will GO cannibalize OG? Maybe, but if it does then GMT will still have utility, and should maintain a user-base in OG because earning GMT will still be interesting enough for people to continue playing, thus, sustaining GST as a utility at the same time. At least the Stepn OG linktree is still on their account and there for anyone to see.

Ultimately, this was not the news I was hoping to hear today, but stepping back for a minute I think it will make sense and should benefit the OG ecosystem (🤞).

The future of Stepn OG: Who the heck knows. Yawn said a Resilience update will be announced next month."

In case the photo doesn't post, shoe is mint 2/7, 93.1 Efficiency, 9.3 Luck, 3.19 Comfort and 29.3 Resilience.

The main benefit of StepN is walking every day with my kids and catching up on things, but I would like to maximize the earning, as I then use GST to get more Solana.

I don't know anyone personally who uses StepN, so I appreciate any suggestions, thoughts etc.  Also, I have only been using this on mobile and am unaware if there is an alternative way to buying Spark to get comfort gems (I used to be able to buy using GMT and I don't see Stepn-specific spark on any exchanges (although I haven't looked exhaustively).

Lastly ,any advice on selling low-level gems?  I have always opened mystery boxes, so I have lots of them but they never seem to sell.  I don't want to price them much below what I see comparable ones listed for but they certainly don't seem to sell for me.

They first asked for my email address and said to that I will receive a verification code sent to my email from Stepn, which I did.

They then asked me to give them the code to authenticate my account. Which I gave them thinking that they will not be able to use it. 

Then I realised that they may have used this to request a password reset, thankfully I had 2FA set up, but then they had the cheek to instruct me to de-active my 2FA to receive the gift. This is when I had enough and reported and blocked the user.

Please spread the word that Stepn does not send DM's and only follow the official accounts."
Need help on getting started with Stepn,StepN,1c9unn8,2024-04-21 18:26:25,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/comments/1c9unn8/need_help_on_getting_started_with_stepn/,AcademicComposer7809,,"Hey guy's, I'm very new to stepn. I haven't purchased anything. I've done some research and  my initial plan/goal/strategy is to earn gst on solana realm (about 300gst a day which will be the max limit) with a lvl 30 common shoe walker (as a primary one) which will have attributes such as efficiency at 100 or above + 2-3 E-slots + lvl3 E-gems and also having some 9-10 trash shoes for energies.

P.S - I'm planning to purchase everything mentioned above directly from the market.
Purchasing a low level shoe/diamond and upgrading or leveling up to the max is not something I feel like is beneficial.

Still I've got some series of questions, would be great if someone help me on that,

Q1: Repair cost system - I know after a walk I would be spending some gst on gst-repairing but what confuses me is, do I have to spend (gst repairing) on just my primary shoe or is it to spend on every shoe including trash shoes?

Q2: Same as Q1 but with comfort-repairing?

Q3: Comfort repairing on different levels - I've heard that going for just gst earnings it's better to go with below lvl 30 shoe (lvl 20-lvl 29) with attributes mentioned above because that would not cost me any gmts for comfort-repairing but only gst+C gems whereas on lvl 30 the cost would be gst+gmt+C gems, is this really the case?

Q4: What is the best possible way to reduce repairing cost?
Having good R gem/points or C gem/points?

Thanks!"

Fitness app Stepn is partnering with sportswear giant Adidas to launch a collection of Solana-based NFT sneakers. This year-long collaboration marks a major milestone for the move-to-earn industry, bringing together a popular lifestyle app with a globally recognized brand. The Stepn x Adidas Genesis Sneakers will be available on the MOOAR NFT marketplace for 10,000 GMT each (roughly $2,500), with a mix of early access opportunities and public raffles. These sneakers will allow players in the Stepn app to earn the app's GMT cryptocurrency by walking, jogging, or running, potentially offering a competitive advantage due to their unique properties."
Common Trainer shoe advice.,StepN,1c34ahi,2024-04-13 11:15:49,2,1.0,9,https://i.redd.it/msmhqaoyj9uc1.jpeg,UnshavenPolice,,"I bought this trainer when StepN first dropped in 2022, for around $3,000. I figured its a good time to get back to it. Recently added more sneakers at the lower prices to increase energy.

When I began, I had intended to create a GST heavy shoe and I feel like I've gone too far to turn back. With a total supply of roughly 1 billion, I think GST could see $1.00 next peak cycle.  

I plan to invest more into higher level efficiency gems. With the current set up,  I average 80-90 GST Per my 9 energy. 

Do yall think this is a good move? What else should I do to increase GST output? Or should I start increasing Luck and see what that brings? 
Could I infuse my trainer with a common or rare? Or the other way around?

 At level 30, my GMT earning is very low, so I don't see the point of trying to switch now."

But never have I had a issue where it says my balance is to low? The first time I did what it said I went and purchased the fee I needed to send. This was for sending GMT - to my StepN account.
And even with the additional fee it failed.

So I tried to send a smaller amount ( quite smaller ) leaving a good amount of GMT. And it still didn't allow me.

So I said alright ill deal with that later,

I also took advantage of the XRP dump earlier and just tried to send this one. The XRP I find is probably fastest crypto to send and have never experienced any issues before. And yet again same issue.

I belive this is a issue coming from CoinBase itself. I do pay coinbase monthly to get rid of all Gas fees. So I have tried to communicate with they "" Priority Support "".

I have been going in circles and circles with a Virtual Assistant and getting annoyed..

Anyone else experience such issues?

With opening costs (including boxes that weren't Easter boxes) I'd say I made around $155. The first 3 days I was just doing my regular GST/GMT walks so didn't really get any boxes bigger than MB4/MB5 and most were smaller and I never got any scrolls. I was planning to just keep doing that but thought why not go for some of the bigger boxes the last day so I did a 20E walk and a 4 E walk and got these two final boxes that helped make up for all the crappy MB boxes I'd opened over the past few months. Shouldn't need to buy another comfort gem to restore my sneakers for quite a while. Thanks STEPN!

Also noticed the L2 efficiency gems are priced so that you'd at least break even if you hit the 33% success upgrade rate plus you have the shot of getting a rainbow gem. I ended up at my usual rate (8 attempts for 2 upgrades, or about 25%) so there was a bit of a loss but it does help clear out the ol' gem warehouse for future box openings.

I have 3 Lvl 8 MBs I'm not opening for now due to the exorbitant cost, but I kept one slot for small boxes and have opened a lvl 1? , 3, and 4.  

The Lvl 1 (IIRC) cost 5 gst to open, but gave back 3 gst, but I had hit the 300 GST earning limit already that day so it helped me to remember to open these low level MBs before going walking.  Next one was a level 3 I think.  In any case, I got two red lvl1 comfort gems which more than covered the opening cost.  Finally my level 4 MB cost 35 GST to open but it had a Lvl 2 comfort gem and some lvl 1 luck gems.  I needed to either buy a L2 comfort gem or risk opening boxes to get one, so I was relieved as they were selling for around 50 GMT last I checked, or about 250 GST.

So far opening the lower level boxes has been going better than MB8/9 so I'll save those for when GST goes back down to .01.  "
