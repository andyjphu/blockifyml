32665 Reset Password Scam,Instagram,1i9xk3f,2025-01-25 16:29:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1i9xk3f/32665_reset_password_scam/,Ch1n5tr4p,Question,"Just today, I got the reset password scam. Unknowingly though, I did click on the link (I know I should have known better). It did redirect me to my Instagram account and it had me to ask a few questions. Not only did I do what it told me to do, but there was one part of the process where something was incorrect. I checked back and that’s when I knew it’s probably a scam. So I deleted and reported the message thankfully, but I’m in weird spot rn. I still have access to my account but I don’t know if I’m still safe. I reseted everything: my password, username, and even added a two-step authentication and checked every information if it’s correct. I still don’t know if I’m safe even when I clicked on the link before. Just want your thoughts and if there’s anything I need to do to be more secured about my account."

Why does no one talk about how Zionists financed and supported the Nazis' rise to power?,EverythingSays,1i9xj6i,2025-01-25 16:27:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverythingSays/comments/1i9xj6i/why_does_no_one_talk_about_how_zionists_financed/,Useful_Yak_1868,,"Why does no one talk about how Zionists helped the Nazis rise to power, even if it meant sacrificing German and Polish Jews? Deals like the Haavara Agreement show Zionist leaders cooperating with the Nazi regime to funnel Jewish emigration to Palestine, while millions of Jews in Europe were left to suffer.

Meanwhile, wealthy American Jews were immigrating to Israel with Zionist support, safe from the horrors faced by their German and Polish counterparts. This wasn’t about saving as many lives as possible—it was about advancing a political agenda, no matter the cost.

Why is this part of history buried and treated as untouchable? We need to confront the uncomfortable truths and acknowledge how power, politics, and self-interest intersected—even during one of history’s darkest times. It’s not anti-anything to demand the full story. We deserve to know.

Idk if he did and idk if they actually texted, i am avoiding to look at his social media, it triggers my healing journey so badly 
I get the urge to check it tho and idk what is true !
Idk how to deal with the above triggers! The idea of him and his ex and his social media 
Shortly, i knew him when he broke up with her, we were just friends and after about 5 month he started flirting and told me he wanted me, although i was scared and didn’t feel safe i thought it might be my trust issues problems and that everything is fine, he is a good guy 
That fkn good guy texted her about 5-6 times after the time he said he liked me 
Told me once that he didn’t move on all of a sudden and i was in an absolute shock 
He didn’t understand how bad was that, told me later i was overreacting and I should have helped him instead of being mad and sad !!! 
In every time it was me or her, he run to her ! I was left lonely, confused, heartbroken 
Then he comes back to me then leaves again !!!! 
She herself doesn’t trigger me (ig) its the idea itself 
Idk how to deal with this ! And idk which is right, to distance myself as I am doing rn and go on with my life
Or expose myself to what triggers me so I build “resilience” as they say??"

Horrific anxiety before therapy sessions,TalkTherapy,1i9xibl,2025-01-25 16:26:46,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1i9xibl/horrific_anxiety_before_therapy_sessions/,jj_anon05,Advice,"I want to say right off the bat that I love going to therapy. I think my therapist is a perfect fit for me and I leave every session feeling better than when I came in. I feel completely safe there and I’m finally able to be vulnerable with another person after never having that before, so I’m really, really confused about why my anxiety levels before therapy are so bad. 

The walk there is almost unbearable. It’s 45 minutes of me hyperventilating, gagging and borderline crying in public for seemingly no reason. As soon as I’m through the door and we get a few minutes into the session the anxiety completely goes away. I thought it would get better but it’s actually getting worse and I had a full blown panic attack at the bus stop the other day before I went. Has this happened to anyone else? What can I do?? "

Best Actress - BP noms changed everything?,oscarrace,1i9xhcz,2025-01-25 16:25:30,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1i9xhcz/best_actress_bp_noms_changed_everything/,Upbeat-Toe3540,Prediction,"Call me delusional, but the more I think about the nominations, the more I believe that Moore's not safe anymore and Fernanda Torres might actually have a shot at winning Best Actress this year.

Hear me out: if I'm Still Here had only been nominated for Best International Feature and Best Actress, I’d agree her chances were slim. But the surprise Best Picture nod changes everything imo — it's a great film, sure, but it really feels like her performance carried the film to that nomination, especially since it didn’t get recognized in any technical categories (not even Adapted Screenplay, despite winning at Cannes).

And ok, apart from the Oscars, her only major nod is the Globes. But let’s be real: most voters likely hadn’t even seen the movie before her Globe win. It’s a smaller, foreign-language film with limited U.S. release — not exactly at the top of voters’ must-watch lists.

But now, with those noms and with the movie just about getting a wider distribution, I think she has a real chance. Against all odds, but definitely not hopeless.

I guess it will depend on how SPC manages the campaign. What do you think?"

I get that currency isn't exactly ""good"". It was a convenient way to circumvent barter etc. Etc. And investing in something that actually has a real world value/application is probably better.

But Bitcoin and other crypto were created to be just that. A currency. Yes decentralized, but it's still a currency.

AIO: Are my friends bad friends or is it my anxiety?,AmIOverreacting,1i9xgpx,2025-01-25 16:24:43,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1i9xgpx/aio_are_my_friends_bad_friends_or_is_it_my_anxiety/,Aware-Afternoon7416,👥 friendship,"I’m a 22F who recently graduated college, while most of my friends are still in school. I met them in college and have always looked up to them—they’re cool, have their lives together, and inspire me. As an introvert, hanging out with them never drained me; it felt effortless and like I didn’t need a social battery.

Since graduating, though, things feel different. I still live in the same city, just a 4-minute walk from them, but I feel socially and physically isolated. Socially, I’m struggling because I don’t have structure or purpose in my life right now while they all do. I know it’s common for recent grads to feel this way, but no one in my immediate circle is in the same boat, which makes it harder. Physically, I feel distanced because my two best friends now live together with two other girls I know but am not close with. I didn’t move in with them—not because I wasn’t invited but because it wasn’t on my radar at the time. Now, when I visit their place, I feel like an outsider, even though my best friends insist I’m welcome. It’s hard to figure out my place in this new dynamic, and my anxiety kicks into high gear when I’m there. I can’t relax, be in the moment, or just be myself. I feel vulnerable and socially awkward. I think it’s because I compare how things are now to how they were in college—when more of my safe friends were around, the living arrangements were different, and I hosted more often, which gave me a sense of control. Now, I feel like I’m intruding on their lives.

For example, when I go over and they’re all watching TV, I panic. My mind races with questions like, “If they’re halfway through a show I don’t know, what do I say? Should I just sit down and try to engage?” I know it sounds minor, but it feels overwhelming. Because this discomfort has lasted for months, I sometimes wonder if it’s more than just my anxiety—if it’s my gut telling me something about the friendships. My best friends constantly reassure me that they love me and appreciate me, but part of me still doubts it.

For instance, I feel like I can’t rant to them about my problems the way I can with my hometown friends. I worry about being negative or a burden, especially because the past few months have been dark for me. This makes me feel like I’m walking on eggshells around them. One of my best friends, in particular, has said we have a sibling-like dynamic, which I appreciate, but she also makes jokes that insinuate I’m dumb. I’m already insecure about this, so I take it personally. When I’ve tried to address it, she rolls her eyes and says she’s joking, but it still stings. She also thinks I’m one of the funniest people she knows, but the fact that I’m not trying to be funny makes me feel misunderstood.

Recently, I opened up to her about how I’ve been feeling, and she told me I shouldn’t come over and be “deep” (e.g., sharing my depression) because the other two girls don’t know how to interact with it—especially if I’m only directing it to my two best friends instead of the group. She said I should try to be more lighthearted and just “be myself.” This has left me feeling stuck. I don’t want to suppress my feelings around my friends, but I also don’t want to overwhelm them or come across as “too much.” 

I know this post will sound biased, but it’s hard for me to jump to the conclusion that they’re bad friends, because overall they’ve been very supportive of me and have showed they care about me in so many ways. I guess I just feel insecure around them. I want to keep them in my life, but I find it very hard to trust my judgement. How do I approach this? I can’t tell if it’s my anxiety or if it’s them or both!!! "
3 antidepressants ok?,antidepressants,1i9xgph,2025-01-25 16:24:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1i9xgph/3_antidepressants_ok/,vps095,,"Curious if anyone has been on 3 antidepressants and whether it’s been ok?

So far I’ve seen some positive effects from Lexapro but am having some sexual side effects.

Advice wanted: kids talking to ex’s new girlfriend,Mommit,1i9xgfs,2025-01-25 16:24:22,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1i9xgfs/advice_wanted_kids_talking_to_exs_new_girlfriend/,noodleblonde,,"Ok so.. my ex and I got divorced 5 years ago bc honestly he sucks. Affairs, mental and emotional abuse, bad financial decisions were all completely normal in that household and I’m so grateful I got out. We have two kids (11 & 7) together and split custody 50/50. We have a decent coparenting system in place. 

I remarried 1.5 years ago and he has a new girlfriend for about a year now. I’ve met her, she seems nice enough, the kids seem to like her which is fine with me. More positive role models aren’t a bad thing. The issue is now that they FaceTime with her (not him) when they are at my house. It’s fine that they talk to her but I’m having an issue with the video aspect. It’s like she is in my house and by extension so is he. I’m wildly uncomfortable with that. Our new home is our safe space and I don’t want them in it. 

How do I tell my kids to not FaceTime them without dumping all my trauma on them? "
Looking for a build suggestion,PathOfExile2,1i9xge6,2025-01-25 16:24:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1i9xge6/looking_for_a_build_suggestion/,uebuka,Question,"Hi guys hope everyone's well!

A month ago I picked a build that fits me and played it up to lvl96. I perfectionized the build in all possible ways and it's really good. I have now best in slot everything and the progress has generally stopped. I can concentrate on experience and go the way to 100, it's absolutely possible, but it became too repetitive. The build earns like 2-3 divines per hour so I have now 60+ to spend and the amount is only growing. As said, nothing can be really improved any more, so there is no point of investment into the current build.

TL;DR  
Looking for a build with a budget of 60-80 divines (I can continue farming even up to 100 if there is a goal) with the following criteria:

\- the least possible button pressing  
\- forgiving to mistakes and delayed actions  
\- fast and effective

My current build is mostly fulfilling the above but as said i got a bit bored from it after 4 weeks.

The one who suggests the build I am looking for, will be rewarded with a divine orb.  
Of course I accept suggestions in private messages if you think that your build shouldn't be shared in public ;)

Thanks guys and stay safe!"

I was talking to someone from the sub via the chat function about an occurrence that happened to me. In said occurrence, I mentioned my response to someone (think one-punch man) who called me the n word (I spelled it out with the r.) Essentially, describing an occurrence from years ago that happened in person.

I was banned from the entire app for 7 days. The part that’s most bothersome is that the message to me says I was “engaging in hate” was flagged automatically by a bot BUT the decision to ban me was made without automation.

The message was then erased for myself and the person I was chatting with.

Time for the bill, I don't tip. ( don't understand the culture, I moved over from Europe, they're making minimum wage and so am I for the most part, it's a table for 2 with no special requests etc) 

The server while handing the bill, keeps her card down suggests leaving a review or something so it can help her and the business, she saw us taking photos and referenced them while I take the POS.


When I pay the amount, the server notices there's no tip or something and asks me what a tip pool is. I nod no and then goes on to enlighten me that even tho she's not shaming us but when we don't tip. They are docked there share of the tips because the kitchen staff also shares from the tip pool and it comes out of their share of the tips.

Either the employee is misinformed or I am gapped on something. What's the scene here ? I had half a mind to point out we never got our waters but didn't want to seem petty and just left.

April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation as the stage is set for the first battle and Naval battle of the war. 23 Alliance ships vs 50 Saderan ships.

**Naval strategies by both sides leading up to the battle.**

Both sides wanted to maximize their advantages and minimize their weakness to successfully combat their enemies in battle.

On the Saderan side Admiral Fabian Florence sought to utilize the Saderan navies numerical superiority against what they saw as backwards barbarians and defeat them in one decisive naval battle however Admiral Grau Tiberius sought too instead have the Saderan navy perform raiding actions across the Eastern Alliance coastline and engage in smaller battles to slowly wear out the Eastern Alliances navy.

On the Eastern Alliance side General Juan Septimus sought to dive the alliance navy. One side would engage the Saderans in a series of naval battles to score one crushing blow after another utilizing superior ships while a smaller portion began blockading the Saderan cost to cut off Naval communications. 

[Admiral Juan Septimus of the Eastern Alliance.](https://preview.redd.it/vmboreo6n6fe1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b7b6047430c5a3ab003f0e9e456a5aa3257f66)

Another strategy Juan advocated was a fighting retreat tactic against Sadera in naval battles to preserve as many ships as possible. The loss of a Man of war class ship would be a devasting blow to the Alliance and the loss of such an expensive class of ship was to be avoided at all costs.



**Early Naval Campaign, the battle of port Lynch, and the battle of Cape Wannoa**

The Naval campaign of the war began that March as on March 6th the Alliance navy took off. The Navy was divided in 3 squadrons. The Leviathan Sea Squadron made up of 60 ships was tasked with Blockading Saderan Northeastern ports. The South Ocean Squadron made up of 27 ships and under the personal command of Juan Septimus was to attempt to snake up pass the Vassal state peninsula and blockade the ports of the Elbe and Mudwan as well as launch raids. The Final Squadron the Avion Sea Squadron made up of 23 ships and led by Vice Admiral Aurthor Prat a seasoned naval commander was ordered to blockade the Port city of Lynch which was the only port in the Saderan province of Avion. 

  
Aurthor Prats squadron was the first to go into action as it arrived at port Lynch on March the 15th with a speed so surprising the local Sadera naval force of 10 Galley's in the nearby area weren't able to get to the port in time to prevent the enviable. Instead of attempting to make battle with a numerical superior opponent the Saderan naval squadron alerted the Saderan naval command.

Saderan naval command was sluggish to respond to the rapid naval advance of an enemy they viewed as lowly barbarians so they kicked the can down the road for around 2 weeks trying to process what was happening. The only person in Saderan admiralty to respond properly was Admiral Grau who cobbled up a fleet of 50 Warships among them 3 Tribute Class and 7 Emperor Class and took off for Port Lynch on March 27th.

  
Meanwhile Admiral Juan Septimus changed the course of his South Ocean Squadron and headed directly for the major Saderan port of Deahis and Propter in an attempt to gain control of the blue sea, blockade the 2 ports and to threaten the Empires capital of Sadera from the sea. 

However, as the South Ocean Fleet made its way towards the 2 largest ports of Sadera the fleet of Admiral Grau or now renamed Fleet Molt headed forward to engage the fleet of Aurthor Prat at Port Lynch.

April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation. At an instant the sailors of the Esmerald head to their positions as well as the sailors in the rest of the ships.

Meanwhile on the Flagship of the Admiral Grau the Conquest, the order was given for the battle standard to be raised on the sails which is was causing all the other ships in his fleet to follow in suit.

As his fleet got into attack formation to punch into the Alliance fleet, he made a speech to encourage them for the upcoming battle. The speech was projected across the fleet using a listeners stone.

""Sailors and soldiers of Fleet molt, the time has come to punish the enemies of Sadera once more. The empire shall be counting on you to deliver us the heads of the enemies to be lain on the feet of the emperor as a testament to our great victory. Victory means sharing glory that will go down in history as the finest naval victory in our empire's history. Let this day become a great tale that shall go down in our history. Long live the empire! Long live the emperor!""-Admiral Grau Tiberius. 

  
At that very moment the population of port Lynch awakened to the sound of their savior's war horns as the Saderan fleet had arrived to put an end to the blockade.

The Garrasion and the people of the port crowded around the walls to watch the naval engagement about to take place. 

On his part Admiral Prat knowing that combat was inevitable organized the fleet into a tightly packed formation to provide support and also like Admiral Grau gave a speak to encourage the sailors under his command.

""Gentlemen battle and death is inevitable, but I expect valor and courage from you. Never has our flag fallen to the Saderans and it won't fall today. I assure you that as long as I live our battle standard shall never fall into the hands of the enemy. If I die my officers shall know how to fulfill their duties to the end. Long live the Alliance!""- Admiral Aurthor Prat.

It was 4:30 in the afternoon and as both fleets began to close in the fire shots were fired as a Saderan ballista with a fire arrows splashed into the water nearly hitting the Alliance corvette the Tempest. Author Prat at this moment ordered 2 Corvettes led by the Tempest to escort the 5 transport ships in the fleet away from combat to prevent any valuable supplies from being sunk.

  
The Esmerald the flag ship of the Avion sea fleet and a man of war class was the first alliance ship to open fire unleashing a full broadside of cannon fire at the Saderan Galley's. Having never encountered gun powdered weaponry before the Saderan Galley's were caught off guard. The Saderan Galley the August was sunk immediately as the cannon balls of the 6 guns on the right side of the Esmerald punched into the hull. The Galley went down and took with it its entire crew of 300 or so sailors and enslaved rowers.

Following their flag ships example the Alliance Galley classes also opened fired at full broadside sinking a further 1 Galley and damaging 3. Lacking the range of the Man of war class the Galley class ships in the Alliance fleet missed most of their targets. 

At 5 pm the Saderan fleet spilt in two at orders of Admiral Grau to cut off and corner the outnumbered Alliance vessels and get into ramming range. Several of the Saderan vessels were also responding to the broadsides of ballista and cannon projectiles of then Avion Sea fleet with their own Trebuchets and enchanted ballista projectiles.

Seeing that the Saderan fleet was intending to encircle his Aurthor Prat relayed orders for his fleet to sail Easter wards to avoid themselves from being cut off. While the withdrawal was in place Author Prat made his ship take the brunt of the Saderan attack personally covering the retreat while also damaging a further 2 Saderan Galleys.

However, things begin to go for the worst when a well-placed Saderan trebuchet projectile slammed into the deck of the Esmerald Damaging the ship.

Meanwhile Admiral Grau ordered his second in command Admiral Garvus to pursue the Corvettes and Transport ships fleeing the battle with his Galley's and Emperor Class ship the Glory while bulk of the Saderan fleet would confront of the Esmerald as it covered its fellow ships retreat.

Like that the bulk of the Saderan fleet began to cut the distance between them and the Esmerald as the Esmerald unleashed broadside after broadside of Cannon fire forcing several ships to retreat to avoid being damaged while also sinking another galley.

By 6 pm the Saderans fleets attempts to get into ramming distance of the Esmerald had failed as the lone Man of War Class ship and the Saderan fleet engaged in a ranged duel. Aurthor Prat had by this point succeeded in buying time for the rest of his fleets escape so he piloted his ship the Esmerald to begin to break off from the long-range duel and to join the rest of the retreating fleet. However, as the Esmerald retreated it was hit again this time by an enchanted ballista projectile which destroyed the mast of the ship and killed several sailors slowing down the ships retreat as the main Saderan fleet moved in for the kill.

Deciding that combat had gone on for too long Admiral Grau moved his Emperor class flag ship directly towards the Esmerald to ram it. Grau's ship the conquest launched itself at the Esmerald at full speed. Admiral Prat seeing the Conquest heading straight for it order his gunners to target the ship and tried to steer his ship out of the wall of the incoming conquest however the conquest got their first ramming its prow directly into the Esmerald's hull before firing its Ballistaes at point blank range slaughtering several of the Esmerald's gunners and crew. 

Seeing the situation unravel but determined to fight to the end Captain Aurthor Prat gave the order to bord the Conquest as he led 60 sailors over the deck and onto the Galley beginning a melee on board the deck of the conquest.

The outnumbered Alliance soldiers and their Admiral hacked their way through the Galley leaving behind 54 dead Saderans before being stopped before they could overtake the command deck and in a sharp Melee Aurthor Prat was killed and beheaded and the rest of the borders killed.

After the failed boarding attempt the Conquest pulled out of its ramming of the Esmerald and shot fire arrows into the Man of War class ship lighting it on fire and incinerating any remaining crew as the ship went down with all hands still firing its cannons even as it burned.

 

[The Esmerald going down in the distance.](https://preview.redd.it/lx3py9t7d7fe1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=919a296b209176c041eec77ac00394a61389bcca)

The battle of Port Lynch was over and ended in a Decisive Saderan victory. However, while the battle of Port Lynch was raging at the same time the second Naval battle of the war began.

The 16 Ships under Admiral Grau's second in command had caught up to the 3 corvettes and the 5 Transport ships fleeing the battle starting the battle of Cape Wonnoa. 

While outclassed and outnumbered the Alliance corvettes had 2 advantages over the Saderan ships. They were fasted and they could go in shallow water.

Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest led his small fleet as close to the cost as possible while covering the transport vessels by unleashing salvos of Ballista bolts from the corvettes.

Grau's second in command attempted and failed to sink the tempest as every time it got into ramming distant the smaller ship was easily outmaneuvered it. This game of cat an mouse continued until the tides turned as the overconfident Sadera fleet fell right into Carlos's plan.

By the time the Sadera's realizes it, it was to late. 8 of the 16 Sadera ships including the Glory Crashed into the underwater costal rocks shattering the bottom of their hulls leading to extensive damage. 

With half the Saderan fleet stuck in the submerged rocks and sinking the tempest and the 2 other corvettes turned around and opened fired a full broad side at the Stuck and sinking Saderan ships. The Saderan ships that were still in safe waters could do nothing but watch from a distance as the Corvettes slowly picked off their comrades one by one unable to intervene out of fear of meeting the same fate. 

Seeing the emerging slaughter in an unexpected act Vice Admiral Garvus hosted a white flag surrendering his Emperor Class ship the Glory to Captain Carlos Camell of the tempest.

The Tempest and the other 2 corvettes stopped their attacks on the other stuck ships and accepted the surrender taking the entire crew of the glory prisoner before leaving with the Transports ending the battle in a humiliating Saderan defeat.

  
As night fell the two battles of Port Lynch and Cape Wannoa ended. The Saderans had won a strategic victory at Port Lynch while the Alliance a tactical victory at cape Wannoa. 

At the battle of port Lynch 456 Alliance sailors were killed and 1 ship sunk and 3 Damaged. Most of the dead coming from the Esmerald while the Saderans lost 578 sailors killed, 5 ships sunk, and 6 ships Damaged.

At Cape Wannoa the Saderans lost 389 sailors killed and 4 ships sunk and 5 damaged while the alliance only had 1 ship damaged and 23 Sailors killed. 

The actions on April the 3rd ended overall in a Strategic Saderan victory as the victory at Cape Wannoa didn't have a major effect on Saderan naval plans and any plans for extending the Alliance blockade past port lynch were destroyed. The Alliance however won a tactical victory on the actions of April the 3rd sinking more ships than Sadera at the cost of 1 Man of war Class ship the Esmerald sunk and 1 Admiral killed. Aurthor Prat would be the highest-Ranking Alliance personnel to be killed over the course of the war.

The battle of port lynch would launch Admiral Grau into stardom as he would begin his journey to become Sadera's best naval commander in history. The battle of Cape Wannoa's on the other part while it didn't undermine Saderan naval efforts in any way proved to be a public humiliation as 16 Galley's were defeated by just 3 small Corvettes. Vice Admiral Garvus would have been executed if he hadn't been captured during the battle for his failure. Meanwhile Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest would arrive to a hero's welcome back in Alliance territory and would be promoted to Admiral due to his successful victory against Sadera and would replace the now dead Aurthor Prat as commander of the Avion sea fleet. Admiral Grau on his part would state the fault of the defeat at cape Wannoa was not on Garvus fault but rather the inexperience of the Saderan sailors and slave labor who had never seen any real naval combat. 

The Sacrifice of Aurthor Prat and the Esmerald at the battle of port Lynch would become forever engraved in the history of Falmart and the alliance as Aurthor Prat would become a national hero for his selfless efforts to save his fleet and fight to the end against a numerically superior enemy.

I’m an e-bike rider. It’s my only form of transportation. I try to be respectful to the cars on the road by riding to the side to give as much passing room as possible and obeying traffic laws. 

More often then not, people will pass me unsafely on blind bends, or when there’s on coming traffic, whipping past me far too close for comfort. It’s unsafe for me, for you, and for other cars on the road. 

Today I was simply riding home from work, when I car caught up behind me and starting honking at me. 2 or 3 full honks, not the gentle beeping some people do to alert bikes of their intent to pass. This car then revved the engine and sped past me downhill on a bend where it’s difficult to see oncoming traffic. Thankfully there were no oncoming cars so nothing bad happened, but that so easily could’ve been disastrous. Frankly, I was terrified for my safety in that moment and I’m still quite shaken over it. The aggression that driver displayed was uncalled for and frightening.

I understand it can be frustrating being behind a vehicle moving slower than you. But please let’s use patience and courtesy when behind bikers/pedestrians, and anyone on the road moving slowly. In pass when clear and safe to do so, and try to give as much space as possible when passing. For everyone’s safety."

It’s convenient for both me and my customers. However, I’ve come across some advice that suggested it might not be the best idea to have customers pay directly into my Trezor wallet because the wallet ID remains static.

From what I’ve learned, this could pose a privacy and security risk. Having a static wallet ID might allow anyone to track transactions associated with that wallet over time, which could lead to unwanted scrutiny or reveal too much about my income or spending habits.

Currently, the way I handle payments is by directing my customers to deposit their payments into Binance using a secure link I provide. The link directs them to changelly.com, where they can complete the payment. Once the BTC arrives in my Binance account, I manually transfer the funds into my Trezor wallet for safekeeping.

I’ve been considering whether it would be more practical or safe to use this method or let customers pay directly into the cold wallet instead. Would using the changelly.com method provide better security, or is there a way to streamline the process while keeping my cold wallet secure?

Still not my strong suit. I appreciate all the feedback last time and it helped me so much. Thanks for taking time out of your days to help. Hopefully I made it better not worse.

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for my debut novel, THE SUNSETS WITH YOU, a contemporary romance complete at 86,000 words. It will appeal to readers who loved the Hollywood dynamic of When In Rome by Sarah Adams and lake town vibes of Meet Me At the Lake By Carley Fortune.

When it comes to taking risks, you’ll find Lena Oakley safely tucked away in her picturesque small town in Maine with her two best friends. Lena has spent years creating a perfect bubble free of tumultuous relationships, and anything anxiety inducing. But with a job she hates, no love life to speak of, and abandonment issues thanks to her mom, she is struggling to find her footing in adult life – unwilling to change a thing, until she finds a for sale sign at her beloved childhood lake house and an acceptance into NYU PR program. 

Lena is faced with staying in her familiar territory Greenwater where the coffee shop knows her order, friends are family, and where the sound of crashing waves is the background music. She has to decide if her status quo is actually fulfilling, simply familiar, or if leaving to chase her dreams of working behind the scenes on Broadway is worth the anxiety that comes with change. Sitting in a dark corner of her favorite bar, Lena catches her celebrity crush’s gaze. Stunned, she starts making a plan about how to approach him, until he abruptly walks out, rudely calling her out for staring.

Callum Hayes, is popping up everywhere, even at work-where she is now forced to work with him on his ad campaign. He turns his attention to her, apologizing for being brash. He slowly worms his way into her life, befriending her favorite people in town, and showering her in attention she's been craving–even if she’s not ready to admit it out loud. She is determined to keep him at arms length, fearful he’ll use her heart until he leaves like her mom did. After quitting her job on a whim and feeling reckless, she decides to say yes to a date with Callum. Cruising the lake, sharing their biggest fears, and him revealing his plans to stay in Maine making her feel a connection she’s never felt, making her question whether NYC is still a dream worth chasing.

I’m a debut author living in west Michigan, originally from a small town near the great lakes in Michigan. I spend my days homeschooling my three boys. THE SUNSETS WITH YOU was inspired by my experiences in childhood and growing up on a lake."
First experience w/ Jumpspeak (not great!),languagelearning,1i9xe27,2025-01-25 16:21:24,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1i9xe27/first_experience_w_jumpspeak_not_great/,shriramk,Discussion,"I recently learned about Jumpstart. I've used Duolingo, Mango, Pimsleur, etc. quite a bit in the past and I'm also using Duolingo now. I've been making my own LLM prompts to create lessons, and figured I was happy to outsource the job.

In my first half hour I'm already very disappointed by *many* things.

1. It seems very difficult to get a price up front from their Web site. That's always a bad sign.

2. When you click on buttons like ""Try 100 days"", you go through an extremely long, irritating, frustrating, sequence of questions and interactions, none of which seem to have any real value *at all*. For instance, after I did what seemed like a ""what is your level"" quiz (and did very well on), there was absolutely no feedback, nor was there any customization when I actually started using the app. It became clear that this is whole process is a bunch of crappy behavioral psychology tricks, not anything tied to learning.

3. After I initiated the payment process, I kept getting several ""upsell"" pages. After two of these I got really annoyed and bailed out of completing the signup process entirely. I even got an email from Jumpspeak: subject ""Can I help?"" and text:

> It looks like you were right in the middle of signing up for our special.
>
> But it appears you didn’t get a chance to finish the checkout process.

etc., with a link to ""fill out the order form and finish your order"" (which I had no intent of doing). But here's the kicker: even before I got this email, I got email from Jumpspeak *thanking me for my order*.

4. When you go to their [Customer Service Portal](https://jumpspeakapp.samcart.com/customer_hub/dashboard), you can *view* your subscription and you can update your card…you can't cancel it. To cancel you have to search in help, [find the relevant page](https://help.jumpspeak.com/article/5-how-to-cancel), then [go to another page](https://www.jumpspeak.com/billing), enter your email to get a magic link, and only then do you get to the billing site. It's safe to say they seem to be trying very hard to make it difficult to cancel. (This is also how I confirmed that I *am* set up to be billed, so I mashed that cancellation button so hard.) Anyway, for those who care, the current rate is ""$69.00 every 91 days"".

5. My ""100 day"" free trial begins on Jan 25 and ends on Apr 25, which… is… not 100 days?!?

Okay, these are the shenanigans *outside* the app! But since I was already registered (against my will!), I downloaded and started to run the app. This is for Italian.

- As noted above, there is nothing customized about it. It didn't seem to do anything with my quiz results to find the right level for me.

- All I go was a very scripted, pre-set set of lessons. Each lesson has has a Listen, Write, Speak, and Conversation mode, with a few prompts in each. It's no less scripted than Duolingo, but isn't even as diverse. The user interface is nowhere near as polished as that of Duolingo. Also, on the Write problems, early on, it gives you no ""distractors"" (wrong choices); I assume that changes after a while.

- There are some silly bugs in the software, like a place where it said something about ""continue to learn English"".

- On the audio (which I suspect is the part that is hardest to get right and most compute-intensive), the system would accept my answers *suspiciously* quickly. I then started to purposely make mistakes. The big ones it caught, small ones (like adding on extra words at the end) it didn't. Not sure how reliable that is.

I then noticed that there is a separate ""AI chat"" mode. Aha, finally, here we go! So I engaged that. There are some scenarios. I picked Travel Planning.

By default, it shows you a question *and* the desired answer. (You can configure a lot of things, presumably including this.) That doesn't seem too useful, but at the same time the question is too complicated to answer otherwise. So I'm not sure how to use this.

Anyway, I noticed it was…rather scripted here, too. So I started to say slightly incorrect things. It just seemed to get stuck asking the same question over and over. I then started to say nonsenical things. It still seemed sort of stuck on a script. Eventually it did show some signs of ""understanding"". But I think the experience here was worse than I'd have if I were typing into a chatbot directly.

BUT: to give it credit: when I ended the lesson, it gave me a score, and then gave feedback on each thing I'd said. The feedback was **pretty good**. *It is also the same as the feedback I've been able to get directly from chatbots* (unsurprisingly). What it didn't seem to be able to do was give any *contextual* feedback: e.g., ""what you said was grammatically correct, it just has nothing at all to do with *travel planning*, and was actually kinda' nonsensical and had nothing to do with my question!"".

I went back to try it again to see whether it would give me a rather different conversation. But from what I can tell, that exact button is … no longer there? This is weird: the whole point of using GenAI is that you can have the same conversation many times, somewhat different each time: e.g., before a trip, it can be useful to practice a dozen *different* food-ordering conversations. Is Jumpspeak removing the buttons after you've tried them once?

So overall, it's a very mixed bag. The signup experience is bad and feels very scammy. (Dear Jumpspeak lawyers: I'm not saying you *are* a scam, you're just…well.) The app is so-so if you take away the ""AI"". The AI part is…mixed so far.

My usual sentiment is to say ""hey, it's a new system, they're trying something interesting, let's see how this evolves"". But the signup process left a poor taste in my mouth, *especially* my not even completing the sign-up — not just in my imagination, but even getting email from them about it! — and then them going ahead and billing me anyway? This is no way to build trust."

I am very concerned about a friend who has been convinced that she is going to die on Tuesday. Advice?,askatherapist,1i9xd8e,2025-01-25 16:20:24,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/1i9xd8e/i_am_very_concerned_about_a_friend_who_has_been/,DoctorCredit,,"I am not entirely sure what I am hoping to get from this post but outside of what I have already done, some general advice on how to communicate with her would be greatly appreciated. 

I received a text message from a friend this morning that was extremely concerning and out of character. The text read “I love you and I am sorry for the pain I have caused you.” This text was so out of place that my immediate thought was this persons phone had been hacked. My husbands initial read was that this is a goodbye message and that this person may be considering self harm. 

After a few hours of texting with her, we scheduled a call where things quickly got worse. She told me that she had had a spiritual awakening and that she was going to die. We discussed this for a bit - she made comments about sinning, and that she is not deserving of life and that god was going to punish her for this. This information had been given to her by an “entity”. I asked if she was at home or with anyone and thankfully she is with her parents. I asked to speak with her dad and she passed the phone over to him without any protest. 

Speaking with her father, I learned that she had been working under an individual on a research project for her PhD candidacy. This person had, over the course of several months, convinced her that he has some supernatural abilities, including the ability to see in to the future. He provided some vague predictions that had become true, and had convinced her that she was going to die on this coming Tuesday. He has assured me that she is no longer in touch with this person and that she is safe at home. Unfortunately when I brought up that I think she should talk to someone (a therapist, the university, and potentially the police) he was resistant and did not think that they would be able to do anything. 

I now have her fathers direct number to check in, but I am hoping to get some advice about how to show up for her over the next couple of days while she is convinced that she is about to die. I am sincerely concerned that self harm is still a possibility. Do I call her daily to see how she is doing? She seemed completely at peace with what is happening and there is no resistance to speaking with me. Do I give her space and check in on Wednesday after everything was ok and she did not die? Do I keep in contact with her father and continue to suggest that she speak with a professional? 

I want to help but I am afraid that in my effort to help I may do more harm. Any advice would be welcome. "

Why You Should Use a Banishing Spell,occultspells,1i9xcfo,2025-01-25 16:19:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/occultspells/comments/1i9xcfo/why_you_should_use_a_banishing_spell/,swingerlover,," 

Banishing spells are among the very critically essential tools that  one needs in their lives. They are so crucial that they can lead to a  complete change in someone’s life. Simply described, banishing spells  establish a safe environment, a psychically secured bubble around you  that may be guarded by hexagrams, pentagrams, Archangels or other beings  and figures

This spell is still regarded as one of the fundamental practices of  ceremonial magic. This spell is quite helpful for everyone who feels  under some negative attacks feels a lot of negativity around them, or  simply feels some sort of possession. It is ideal for banishing  negativity and cleaning the spiritual space. Banishment spells have been  around since the dawn of time and used often with other spells to  enforce the results, especially love spells.

In several cultures of Paganism, banishing is conducted to eliminate  negative or undesired energy, or in some instances people who can cause  problems in our work or general life. While some cultures view banishing  as a retrogressive practice because of their reasons i.e. like the  saying that it affects the free will of others if your culture has no  bans against such matters, then there is no basis that you can’t  practice a banishing spell. Remember the main aim of a banishing spell  is to eliminate those trying to interfere with your relationship, work  or the smooth running of your life. It is not about harming other  innocent people who may have nothing negative about your life.

There are distinct approaches that can be applied to achieve  successful banishing. Depending on your preference, you will need to  choose one among the available approaches- depending on how satisfied  you are with the varying methods and what you are trying to attain.

**Dealing with the unknown spirits.**

Knowing your enemies presents the easiest way to handle the problems  they are causing in your life. If you are fortunate, you can face the  person you no longer wish to see in your life and let them know that.  They will leave you alone. Nevertheless, this may seem simple said than  done. In some worst scenarios, you may not be aware of the person  causing the problems you are facing. This is where the Banishing spells  come in. Even though you may not know the source of your problems, you  will still get the assistance you deserve.

&#x200B;

**Banishing Ritual**

According to experts of magic and life, the worst enemy that can  impact negatively on your life is bad spirits. These can either be cast  by your rivals or you may be the one who invited them. While handling  the spirits cast by your rivals may be somewhat challenging, there is  arguably no other thing you should do apart from dealing with the bad  spirits that you may have attracted into your life.

By now, it should be clear that the things you draw into your life  are nothing but the things you are preoccupied with. In this regard, I  imply that in case you are preoccupied with anxiety, you will draw the  same anxiety into your life. By equal measure, if you are overwhelmed by  a dislike for someone you are destined to draw hatred to your life as  well. If you trust that everyone you find in your everyday life is  anticipating harm you then that is what will possibly occur.

With that in mind, the ideal defense from evil spirits is to make  sure that you guard yourself with joyful situations and joyful people.  Above all, use the banishing spell. Never allow others space to control  the state of your spirit at any instance; God should only have such  right in your life. Allow the energies of the banishing spell to defend  you. Rise every day with the determination that you are safe with the  spell. You should always keep in your mind that you are the boss of your  fate and your life will run as per the way you desire it to.

If you have any doubt that there may be harmful spirits in your life,  your place of work or your relationship, it is time to act. The  Banishing spell will eliminate them and allow you to live a free life. I  have had many people casting away the most dangerous spirits in their  lives by utilizing these spells. Note that it is preferable to protect  yourself with the banish spells rather than to wait for something to  befall you to act.

AITA for avoiding my sister for supporting my daughter,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i9xc8k,2025-01-25 16:19:14,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9xc8k/aita_for_avoiding_my_sister_for_supporting_my/,Summermyst,,"I (57f) am being told I need professional help and constantly put down for not supporting my daughter (33f) after she's inflicted repeated trauma over the years. I know this will be rambling but right now I'm very emotional so sorry in advance.

My daughter has struggled with drug and alcohol addictions for years. This has lead to her loosing 3/4 kids the oldest of which I have raised the majority of his life.  Through it all I have been blamed for everything negative in her life, despite this I have always been there for her and supported her. I sent my grandson away so I could help her detox. Put my life and emotions on hold and forgiven her everything justifying it as being an illness. That was until this summer, she was sober for a short time before using again, during that time again the grandson was put through it and found drugs she was using, Something just happened and I was done, when she went back into treatment I didn't have faith, I honestly didn't care which is crazy for a mom but emotionally I think I was done. The stress has been so bad that over the years I have had two emotionally caused heart attacks and physical injuries from her drug induced rages.  She's stolen from me, tried to have me arrested with a made up story ect ect. I do understand it is part of addiction am only adding for context. And I am leaving out ALOT her addiction started when she was 12. There has been times of remission but most of the years she was using. At this point even sober her behaviors are those of her using. (meth, fentanyl,  everything you can think of)

My sister stepped in this time when she went to recovery. I am thankful she is there for her when I can't be but at the same time I'm hurt, my sister was my confidant and I feel alone and betrayed. Yesterday she upset my grandson by defending his mom when she had hurt him, for him it was a last straw and he blocked my sister. Her response was to ask me what was going on. I have repeatedly tried to explain but she wont listen insisting she is there for all of us. I have told her she isn't because every conversation is about her defending my daughter and saying everyone else needs professional help. She keeps insisting my daughter wants a relationship with me sooo bad but when I point out she doesn't call or do anything to show that, I am told I'm the one who needs professional help?  As an example when I bought her baby clothes it was pulling teeth to get her to come get them.  When she did she barely talked to me in the 10 minutes she bothered to stay, then called my sister right after excited she saw me and had a wonderful visit? 

I wrote her a letter explaining exactly how both me and my grandson were feeling and why she isn't there for us all when she dismisses everyone's feelings however she is refusing to read it unless it's with me. I did tell her I can't do that and feel safe and if she read it she would know why. At the moment it's ended with her again basically blaming me for not being ""healthy"" and needing professional help (I see my phycologist due to the repeated trauma) and when I am ready to see her we can talk. I didnt respond. I know it's going to end up with her telling me I need professional help and how much my daughter wants a relationship with me. 

AITA for not wanting to see her face to face and just walking away? And should I send the letter even though she doesn't want it like my husband suggested. "
850 nm on Insulin Response / goggles for NIR?,redlighttherapy,1i9xc7a,2025-01-25 16:19:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/redlighttherapy/comments/1i9xc7a/850_nm_on_insulin_response_goggles_for_nir/,BKM-StLouis,,"A key part  to this interview with Professor Glen Jeffrey:  https://youtu.be/9Amma2y8UD0 is at about minute 29.5 for 4 minutes

He discusses his initial research on 670 nm red light and blood glucose.  He then talkd about  redoing that research with the much more common 850 NIR nm wavelength by exposing people to 850 nm NIR without their knowledge. 

This discussion is significant because

1.   850 nm NIR is in almost every RLT device.  

2.   NIR was clearly safe to the ethics committee on the study, without any discussion of eye protection. 

The latter relates to the repeated, monotonous discussion of goggles. "

"Hey guys, so with all the confusion going around, I would like to bring my analysis of the trailer (this is also available on the Fandom page). Please note that this is just based off of what has been noticed in the trailer so far.",PoppyPlaytime,1i9xbca,2025-01-25 16:18:08,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoppyPlaytime/comments/1i9xbca/hey_guys_so_with_all_the_confusion_going_around_i/,jthesmg4fan,Gameplay Trailer Analysis,"The trailer starts off with the theme of the new character’s commercial. It eventually fades into screams and a siren blaring. Dough starts dripping down from the ceiling, before cutting to a black screen where Poppy Playtime tells The Player that this is “unlike anything you’ve seen above. It’s hell.”

It cuts to a shot of a prison area, likely the one teased in The Doctor cinematic trailer. It then cuts to a scene, likely also in the prison area, where a door closes as Poppy states that Playtime wanted it to be hell as the doors close completely.

Harley Sawyer, using a Playtime Automated Companion TV, curiously asks “What’s this?” referring to The Player before they then fall backwards. We then cut to the trash pile area seen in the Chapter 4 Teaser Trailer, with the new character talking about how Harley, nicknamed “the Doctor“ works directly under the Prototype and controls this part of the factory. As he says “Hunting us,” a shot of The Player trapped in a cage as Yarnaby passes by pops up, before cutting to a shot of a painting with the words “SAFE HAVEN” written above a picture of hands protecting colorful little people.

Harley then states that there are no places to hide, not from him, as a shot of The Player in a power room of sorts while Yarnaby, now massive, stalks them, potentially meaning that Yarnaby will grow either bigger or smaller over the course of the game. It also reveals that there are multiple bodies for Harley, meaning he probably won’t go down as easily. A mystery character says that he has “something special in mind.” This plays over a shot of Poppy and Kissy Missy, potentially revealing that she is alive.This shot also reveals that a belt has been situated around her waist, similar to DogDay, which could imply that Kissy has the belt in order to keep her insides from falling out.

Poppy states that “we need to make this right,” as Harley waves at The Player before The Player falls down the stairs. It then cuts to a shot of The Player shining a light on one of Harley’s bodies, having an arm out. This could potentially mean that the Weeping Angel mechanic used for Miss Delight could return. It then cuts to a shot of the Nightmare Critters attacking The Player as they fend them off using the the orange hand.

It cuts to a tattered and cluttered room presumably full of skeletons (or Harley’s bodies), before then switching to a shot where a door opens behind a desk as Harley says “Let’s make a game of you.” Another shot of the Nightmare Critters, this time in a more cinematic angle appears, before quickly cutting to Kissy banging on a door with The Player behind them, as Poppy begs whoever’s in that room to hurry and let them in, revealing that Kissy Missy is most definitely alive. This shot also reveals that Kissy is missing half of her head and also shows off the belt once again, most likely due to her getting attacked at the end of Chapter 3.

Pianosaurus, keys playing, then runs towards the camera before Ollie yells “He’s outside!” The new character states that they have failed you, before a very big Baba Chops jumps towards The Player. As Yarnaby, now smaller than the last time we’ve seen him and his mouth wide open similar to one of the screenshots revealed about a day before the trailer released, runs towards The Player, Poppy yells “You lied to me!” to an unknown character, likely Harley. A shot of TVs, turning on with the eye of Harley Sawyer appears as a door in that room opens.

We finally cut to a continuation of the first scene with the alarm still going in the background, dough dripping more and more down the ceiling, eventually cascading down, forming a new character. This new character, placing a hat on his head, is revealed to be the heavily teased Doey the Doughman, as he greets the Player as “Pal,” before asking them to follow him. His face seems to downturn after he says this.

The trailer then cuts to black as the Chapter 4 logo, glitching in and out as it is formed by dough, appears, the words “Safe Haven” appearing below it as the entire logo becomes gray. It then cuts to the release date of January 30th, 2025, confirming that the game is not delayed. The trailer then ends."

 I'm looking for a place to stay during that time that is:
- Perfectly safe for a single woman (assuming normal precautions like not walking around alone late at night);
- Quiet and conducive to rest; 
- With beautiful nature and preferably near great swimming holes or on the coast.
- With good grocery stores/fresh fruit and veggie markets nearby/in town
- With a Spanish language school nearby/in town (I plan to take classes)
- welcoming towards tourists (Costa Ricans were very friendly to me when I travelled before but in case there are less friendly areas I'm not aware of)
- Rent is about $1000 per month with solid WiFi. 

Any such places come to mind?

Any advice is appreciated. "
How cooked is the military?,Destiny,1i9xb2v,2025-01-25 16:17:48,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1i9xb2v/how_cooked_is_the_military/,TheProdigis,Political News/Discussion,"This is sort of me doomer maxxing but along with Pete Hegseth being appointed, things are genuinely looking really bad. 

I don't really know anyone who is in any branch of the military and so I am pretty unconnected from what the culture of the military is at all. I feel its a safe assumption that it probably leans far more right. But I really don't know. 

But I also have been under the assumption that the military is run by people who care about actual competency, as I thought our military was always an extremely effective machine. Considering Trump and MAGA are allergic to competency, are there people in the military who are willing to stand up to do the right thing or has the brainrot already infected those circles?

I reread it hoping that I'd find it wasn't that bad- that I am being unreasonable. Hoping it would justify me picking up the phone and calling you and mom.

It did the opposite. My previous attempts to connect and reconcile somehow got twisted into ammunition. You saw an attack instead of a scared adult child trying to explain their truth. Which doesn't surprise me, I guess - that's been happening since I was a child.

I want you to know how hard it is for me to be no contact. How much I want parents who feel safe and loving. I miss you, I miss Mom. This whole fight started because I'm so, so, so worried about her. And instead of listening to that, you threw stones that isolated the both of you.

Dad, I know you're hurting. I know Mom is too. That was never a doubt. And I wish so much that you both find therapeutic support, happiness, and joy. I'm sorry that this is what I need to do to keep myself safe. I wish there was any other way. But with how you ended that letter, you seem to have known that before I even cut things off. "

They don't work well any more and I would love to remove them, but they are connected with these big honking things. Is there any chance I can remove these without an electrician? We can't for the life of us figure out if they're connected by anything but wires. The breaker is cut for these, would it be safe to hack the wires off and add some end caps?

First impressions as near beginner- Horizon Hobby's Apprentice STOL S 700mm - RTF,RCPlanes,1i9x8vv,2025-01-25 16:15:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RCPlanes/comments/1i9x8vv/first_impressions_as_near_beginner_horizon_hobbys/,Whitebaron1993,,"Hi All, 

Was recently in the market for a small RTF plane to get me back into the hobby and thought I would share in case anyone else is in a similar position.

I was initially looking at the HH Sports Cub s2 RTF as I liked the looks, Flight modes, Panic button and handy size. The reviews suggest it is an excellent aircraft but in my research the Apprentice STOL S 700mm-RTF popped up and caught my attention and ultimately was purchased. 

Why did I buy the Apprentice:

1. Size-Slightly larger but with removable wing so maintains similar portability with a bigger aircraft (bigger is better after all)
2. Propulsion-Brushless motor, directly driving the prop. The Sports cub uses a small brushed motor with a gear to turn the prop and a 1 cell battery. Personally I prefer the idea of a brushless and in videos I have seen I feel the Apprentice is quieter which I think has a lot to do with the propulsion system.
3. Battery-Battery security. The cubs battery is velcroed into a slot in the bottom of the plane and I don't like the idea that a bit of Velcro is all that's holding it in. The apprentice has a magnetic latched canopy and velcro installed inside to secure the battery.
4. Transmitter- The Apprentice comes with a full size transmitter compared to the ""game controller"" style included with the Sports Cub. It is worth noting that the transmitter included with the apprentice is basic and not as powerful as a ""proper"" transmitter but it is the same form factor and has a usb C that allows you to connect it to a pc/laptop and use the included software key to fly in Horizon Hobby's RC flight sim, but more on that later.

Unboxing:

Well packaged and arrived in perfect condition, the box is well designed to be usable for transporting the plane as it feels secure after unboxing as a storage and transport solution. There are lists of what is included in the box online so won't repeat here but everything you will need is included.

First Flight:

In a spur of the moment decision before a big storm blew through I managed to get a short flight in. 

* I did not secure the battery in my haste or check the centre of gravity(CG) and can report the plane remained very docile even without correct CG being checked.
* The plane has plenty power and can nearly climb vertically.
* In beginner mode it is a joy to fly and is a 2 channel experience.
   * the onboard stability system does some mixing of channels 
      * throttle and elevator work together such that to clime or descend you need only adjust the throttle.
      * Ailerons and rudder work together to make nice smooth, coordinated turns.
   * Overall, fun easy flying without breaking a sweat can just enjoy a nice looking plane flying peacefully with zero dramas.
* Intermediate mode mostly just ensures that the plane cannot go inverted but allows more freedom.
* Expert mode total freedom to find out what the plane is and is not capable off
* PANIC!!! the panic button is very a excellent investment protection device as it means that as you venture away from the safe harbour of beginner mode, you have the safety of knowing that if you loose orientation of the plane and don't want to lawn dart your plane into the ground, you can temporarily hand the controls back to the stability system and get your bearing back.

Overall, very pleased with my choice and would thoroughly recommend if anyone is in the market for something similar.

Please let me know if there are any questions I would be happy to help where I can.

I (20F) was traumatized by my boyfriend's (21M) fraternity and don't know how to move forward,relationship_advice,1i9x7uh,2025-01-25 16:13:49,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9x7uh/i_20f_was_traumatized_by_my_boyfriends_21m/,Scubadubadue,,"My boyfriend and I have been dating half a year or so. Although I've always had strong thoughts about ""frat bros,"" I gave my current boyfriend, Aaron (fake name), a chance because he wasn't off-put by forwardness of wanting a real relationship -- something hard to come by on a small college campus that's mainly greek life. We started dating, and things have been wonderful. I've never been with a man who treats me this incredible. He spoils me, dotes on me, does anything I ask and is very open and honest. Or so I thought. About a month in, his Big, Brady (also ake name) joked about his nicotine addiction. To my knowledge, although I knew he drank, I was upfront at the beginning about how I disliked smoking, so he said he smoked occasionally in high school but it wouldn't be a big deal to eliminate it from his life. Although he had been trying to quit since starting to date me, he had been lying and still smoking vapes from his friends when offered. He promised to never do it again and to be honest, and I believed him, especially because my friends actually liked him and said that he clearly loved me and that addiction is hard to overcome and be honest about.

Another incident a month or two after that was during ""girls night."" He was the honorary ""waiter"" for our alcohol and was more than welcome to have some. Although I'm mostly over it now, it was a horrible night for him that led to him totally blacking out and projectile vomiting into my eyeball, all over my bed, breaking my shower, etc. And during Christmas, he got blackout and spam called me Christmas night. Ater this, he swore he'd start AA if he couldn't learnt o start moderating his alcohol. After that, it's smooth sailing. I'd like to preface that the only issue I've ever had is with his substance use, in which I honestly know that he loves me and treats me well and that he will follow through with his promises.

We roll around to roughly a week ago on his 21st birthday. I give him spectacular gifts and have fun plans for the following day. I hugh him before he's about to go to a bar with his friends to have a max of two drinks at each bar (there's a maximum of 4 bars in this small college town, especially within walking distance). I reach into his pocket and there it is: a vape that he stole from his frat brother. I confront him, and we get into an argument. However, I confirm with he girls that his addiction isn't something worth breaking up over. I feel pretty alright after getting a second opinion that even now, I agree with. He goes to the bars.

Three hours roll by. I ell asleep in his bed. The door suddenly slams open, and here he comes slumping into the room. He immediately knocks over his television, and upon doing so, crushes the 70 dollar vintage train set I got for his birthday. He's stumbling around like a total drunkard. I'm so upset that he'd betray me in this way, but more so about the 70 dollars instantly going to waste. I'm also a little worried because he'd never been that energetically blackout before, if that makes sense. I put on my jacket and whatnot and run out of the room. all of his fraternity brothers are drunk and confused, especially when he runs out in nothing but underwear after me in -8 degree weather. He grabs onto me on the walkway and is just muttering nonsense. The only things I can make out cohesively enough is that he'll ""die without me"" and ""kill himself if I leave him."" I'm terrified and he refuses to let go of me. I start with whispering clamly but he keeps dragging me back toward the entrance. Some of his brothers are watching and laughing. I text his Big almost complete terrified gibberish with only ""please help me"" and ""get him off of me"" being readable. He finally gets off of me and his brothers let him in. I am a sobbing mess and they simply look over me, telling him about ""woah man, you really outdid yourself"" and stuff like that.

I walk home at 3am in terror because I couldn't even see -- I had taken out my contacts or bed and, in a rush, obviously didn't put them back on. I'm scared there might be other drunkards walking around. Two of his brothers contact me to ask if I'm alright and that it's safe for me to come back, knowing that I had a situation that my dorm was currently taken by a visiting graduated friend. I go back, those two brothers out of the 9 that went out are still drunk but are taking care of both me and him and are pissed at his behavior. I end up sleeping in one of their rooms.

I wake up to loud shouting and laughing by four of the people -- one of them being Brady -- about how funny Aaron was last night -- how he received texts from me, but how harmless the situation actually was. I am so mad and angry. Brady hadn't even asked what the situation was or texted to see what happened. He didn't care, quite frankly. Aaron woke up with a hangover, and upon learning about the situation, is super apologetic. He says he'll start AA right away. He does everything right following this incident. However, at this point, I trust that he loves me and will do what he needs to to keep me.

However, I'm still piping mad at the 7 fraternity brothers that did nothing. I'm mad at the four that stood and watched when I could've been assaulted or could've fallen on the ice and got a concussion. I'm mad at the fact that nobody had the common sense to get him to the state of blackout and consider being remotely sober or it. There's so many intricate details to their behavior afterward when sober that just points to them being selfish, stupid, irresponsible pieces of shit -- because frats are supposed to ""put women first"" and ""protect women."" They made light of the situation, even after finding out from Aaron the full details of what had happened. Even when drunk the two brothers that took care of him saw the seriousness of Aaron's and their brother's state and even apologized for a situation that they had no accountability in. One of them hadn't even gone to the bars with Aaron.

Yes, objectively, things did not go as poorly as they could have. I didn't get assaulted. I didn't end up with a concussion or something. But I felt so betrayed when I saw them laughing and watching when I was calling to them for help. I felt so alone and scared. And their behavior when sober makes me hate everyone except the two nice ones hate them with every fiber of my being, especially Brady.

Apparently Brady had kept buying Aaron drinks when Aaron told him to stop. Arron was already blackout, and Brady bought him six more shots and the strongest drink at a bar. He then went to bed instead of dealing with the situation at all, having gotten extremely drunk himself. Brady failed both of us that night, and I hate him for that. He kept making jokes about it the morning after, and Aaron told me that he had made an announcement of his sobriety to the entire fraternity and explained what happened. Only the two nice guys and Aaron took responsibility. to everyone else, it was ""no big deal"" and he was ""being too hard on himself."" Brady especially kept inviting Aaron over to drink afterwards, and even after two asks from Aaron to apologize to me, he refused, saying he would when he ""next saw me in the house."" Aaron had previously said that I would not be over at the house until god knows when. I received a bullshit excuse literally a week after the incident, but it was just full of excuses of why what happened happened. 

I hate that place and I hate 3/4s of the people there (as it's a decently small chapter on this campus). Everytime he mentions having to do something or I think anything frat related, I'm brought back to that night. And Aaron just today understood that it's no longer about ""us."" It's about them.

I genuinely don't know what to do moving forward. I love Aaron so much and I know nothing similar will happen again, but I don't know how to cope with him being close friends with the people that abandoned me that night and I can't even get a real apology out of any of the seven that failed me. Even sober, they're utter pieces of human filth.

It would be unfair to hate something and the people that takes up the majority of his week. With that night, I lost all respect, likenes, trust, and care for the majority of those people and that place for their irresponsibility both during and after that night. I keep having flashbacks and panic attacks that take me back to that night. The only way I could move past it is for him to eliminate the fraternity from his life entirely, which he's willing to do -- but that would be unfair to him, as that's the only people he is close to on this campus. And the fraternity has somehow ""made him a better person"" and given him ""great opportunities,"" even if all he is is surrounded by womanizers, liars, cheats, addicts, and immature, irresponsible fuck faces, in my humble opinion.

It feels like an ultimatum situation, quite frankly. It would be unfair to force him to sever ties (even though I don't understand why he still couldn't be close friends with literally the four good guys in that place) and isolate him by making him quit the fraternity, but it would also be unfair to both of us for me to hate a major part of himself. I know the easy answer is to break up, but I see a rich and happy future with this man. I just don't know how to disconnect him from the fraternity. 

How do we, or simply I, move forward from this?"

I would say I like watching shows, but my attention span is kinda bad and it takes a month to even finish a show for me. 

My friends and family would say I'm annoying maybe, funny, sensitive, self centered (which I don't believe I am), but that's just how they see it.. I've been compared to an orange cat whatever that means.

Uhmm I am definitely extremely curious and love talking about theories relating to the meaning of life, religion, multiverse, the subconscious, things like that.. 

I don't like to be alone ngl or at least I like to be surrounded by people I'm comfortable with and safe by.

For highs and low, I would say both are extreme, if I'm happy I'm EXTREMELY ecstatic and when I'm upset I fall into a depressive state. Which for mental health I have been diagnosed w that before, if that helps.

I am 26M from Hungary. I am pretty much an introvert (INTJ) and kinda a nerd ig, I have degree of Mathematics (i can help with your math homework) and CS, also I work in IT field.

I like to play videogames and ideally you also would be down to play something together. Maybe just some chill co-op game or even just watch me play while we talk, it is a good way to do stuff together in LDR. We can also watch random series if you are into that. My other hobbies are doing/watching sports, I like F1 and football, also i used to fence and table tennis in college. I used to go hiking a lot from my summer house, maybe we could go there together sometime? I also like to learn about different cultures and languages, I speak several at least in a basic level. I have a goofy ahh family dog but I rarely see her since I moved :c

Physically I am 6'3, white, on the skinnier side. I have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Personality wise: as I already said I am an introvert and kinda quiet sometimes. I am smart and reportedly funny sometimes. I am kind, patient, and I would love to listen to you yap about anything, I am supportive and I would always remember small things u told me. So if you like to get showered with attention and feel loved and special I am a very good choice :3. Also I am loyal and VERY honest about things, so if you are the type of person who gets offended easily this wont work. If I have a problem I would let you know, I do not care if it is something you dont want to hear, honesty is always the best option.

So what I am looking for is a female around the age 20-28, preferably from EU, or would consider move to the EU in the future (if everything works out). But lets just talk and we will see, we can worry about distance stuff later. Appearance wise I dont have much preference, I like girls on the skinnier/fit side, but It doesnt matter as long as you look healthy. I would like us to exchange photos early on. I prefer someone with shared interests and hobbies, or at least be open to try stuff together. I want a relationship where we can be ourself and talk about anything openly. Being with someone where you feel safe and dont have to filter youself all the time is the best feeling. And as I said I value honesty, open communication and loyalty. I am looking for something monogamous obviously, it should go without saying but you cant know in this cooked generation. **Make sure you are actually committed for a LDR and wont change your mind. Also be able to meet up within a reasonable time.**

If this sounds interesting send a small intro and maybe a pic of yourself. I would like to move to a different platform as soon as you are comfortable with it, doesnt matter where, just away from Reddit lmao"

I have a goofy ahh family dog but I rarely see her since I moved :c

Physically I am 6'3, white, on the skinnier side. I have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Personality wise: as I already said I am an introvert and kinda quiet sometimes. I am smart and reportedly funny sometimes. I am kind, patient, and I would love to listen to you yap about anything, I am supportive and I would always remember small things u told me. So if you like to get showered with attention and feel loved and special I am a very good choice :3. Also I am loyal and VERY honest about things, so if you are the type of person who gets offended easily this wont work. If I have a problem I would let you know, I do not care if it is something you dont want to hear, honesty is always the best option.

So what I am looking for is a female around the age 20-28, preferably from EU, or would consider move to the EU in the future (if everything works out). But lets just talk and we will see, we can worry about distance stuff later. Appearance wise I dont have much preference, I like girls on the skinnier/fit side, but It doesnt matter as long as you look healthy. I would like us to exchange photos early on. I prefer someone with shared interests and hobbies, or at least be open to try stuff together. I want a relationship where we can be ourself and talk about anything openly. Being with someone where you feel safe and dont have to filter youself all the time is the best feeling. And as I said I value honesty, open communication and loyalty. I am looking for something monogamous obviously, it should go without saying but you cant know in this cooked generation. **Make sure you are actually committed for a LDR and wont change your mind. Also be able to meet up within a reasonable time.**

If this sounds interesting send a small intro and maybe a pic of yourself. I would like to move to a different platform as soon as you are comfortable with it, doesnt matter where, just away from Reddit lmao"

Taking this evo out for the first time today and I just cannot get it to stop climbing. This is my 4th UMX so I'm not a total newb but am still learning!

The main issue is that with SAFE on I can get the plane to fly level by using the transmitter trim but the second I turn SAFE off the plane dives... If I use the transmitter trim to get the plane to fly level with SAFE off then it climbs like crazy the second I turn SAFE on.

Can you have separate trims for when SAFE is off and on? That would solve it if that's possible.

The other issue is that to manually adjust the elevator trim you have to unscrew the attachment but the screw faces the fuselage so I can't get my hex into it. What the heck?

I had such high hopes for this plane. Please help!"
"Food recommendations in Siem Reap, Cambodia (for the adventurous)",travel,1i9x521,2025-01-25 16:10:20,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i9x521/food_recommendations_in_siem_reap_cambodia_for/,tuaho,Question,"Backstory: I'm at the end of my 1 week holiday in SR and just wanted to share my experience here. Before visiting SR (and Cambodia) for the first time I did a lot of research trying to find the best places to eat here. Unfortunately I have mixed feelings about them because I don't think they actually give you a real taste (pun intended) of Cambodia. What I find interesting though that even when asked about their personal favourites, the locals also tend to recommend the same few places that are at best safe options, and at worst tourist traps. In reality, you'll not see a local eat in any of these places e.g. the famous Neary Khmer. I was quite disheartened to go to a few places recommended by locals only to find tourists and expats eating there. I have several theories why this is the case:

1) They are afraid to recommend something cheap, potentially unhygienic, and maybe even offensive for a tourist not used to the local food and prep.

2) The average Cambodian is relatively poor. They don't have the luxury to eat out frequently and genuinely think that the expensive, westernised restaurants serve better food than their usual eateries.

3) They have indirect links to some businesses and are trying to help each other out.

This is nothing against the locals, they're the most friendly and welcoming people I've ever met but it did struck me as unusual why they always appear very reluctant to personally recommend a place to eat. The locals I've spoken to are either in the hospitality or F&B business e.g. hotel or cafe staff who are aware that they're talking to a tourist, which might explain points #1 and #3 above. You might find that talking to a local outside these businesses may yield a different result. 

If you're English speaking you're likely to rely on Google maps and Google reviews to find the best places. However, I don't think Cambodians do the same. What you get then is hundreds of places that are rated 4.5 and above, purely by tourists and not locals. It is sometimes shocking to see how highly rated a place is only to find how mediocre the food was upon visiting. To be fair to SR food, it is mostly decent anywhere you go and I think that's why even okay food get the 5 star treatment from tourists. But once you've had GREAT food, you'll quickly realise that many places don't deserve the star rating they have on Google maps.

It's only when you stop looking at online reviews and use your own eyes, nose and mouth to check out the places that you'll stumble upon several gems that are not mentioned anywhere online. I get that this may be difficult for some, the reason why I kept going to tourist traps at first was because I had elderly parents to tend to and it's simply more convenient to take them somewhere nearby or follow a recommendation instead of scouting around (they can only walk down a few streets at a time). It was only when my wife and I had a day to ourselves did we find the best Cambodian food around. 

TLDR; Okay you just want some recommendations! Bear in mind the title, here are my top picks: 

1) Sinorn borbor Monsrae សុីណន បបរមាន់ស្រែ
https://maps.app.goo.gl/MxWDSK8E1WWWTZDr5
The only place with actual Google reviews, mostly 5 stars. The one 3 star given was by someone who ordered a Japanese noodle dish in a Cambodian rice porridge (borbor) breakfast place. You'll see locals come in and out to enjoy a meal. The menu on the wall is an obvious tourist menu. Simply ask for the rice porridge instead, you can also have noodles as substitute.

2) Psar Gne Street
There is a food court in the market along this street. It doesn't appear on Google maps but hard to miss when you're there. Plenty of hawker stalls selling in a food court. We tried the fried short noodles (again not obviously on the menu) and fried chicken / fish sticks mixed with spicy sweet powder. They were very delicious. It's much smaller than the main night market where tourists go but you see the opposite here where the main customers are locals. 

3) ចង្រឹតបំពងចិនចាវ
https://maps.app.goo.gl/76CvW9r1muPSZ8Az8
Not far from Psar Gne you'll find locals crowded around a small food cart selling deep fried insects and silkworm. The aroma is enticing. I don't think I'll say much here. Those who are interested will check it out, those who aren't won't. It's genuinely delicious, forget the whole eating insects / worms bit. There's a reason for a queue here every evening, and some items are sold out before closing time.

4) Srey Lon BBQ Grill
https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZGfZc9Eg6FDhV3s8
An even smaller humbler food cart, targeted to the local shopkeepers and tuk tuk drivers resting nearby serving simple skewers. The beef skewers are so good (from a satay lover), and they come with tasty pickled vegetables and super spicy chili. It wasn't on Google maps before but I loved it so much I submitted an edit to list her business to help her out. A true roadside street food experience. 

5) អាហារដ្ឋាន ឡាយ ហេង ហេង
https://maps.app.goo.gl/bi1p9e6TFPDqT41k6
I don't even know if the Cambodian word above is correct but I used Google lens to copy it from a photo I took. The location is pinned in the link. Look for green signs advertising 4000 riel ($1) for a plate of rice and bowl of meat and vegetable stew of your choosing. Free bottomless iced tea. I had a small portion of rice but a big portion may be slightly higher than $1. My wife had no rice and they charged her $0.75. If you're from SEA, you'll be familiar with ""economy rice"". Hearty delicious home style food. That price - insane. Another place where you see locals eat and tourists walk by to have pizza next door. 

6) Angkor Hospital for Children
មន្ទីរពេទ្យកុមារអង្គរ
https://maps.app.goo.gl/2PovRD68iK1XvYTZ7
What's this?! Not a food place but I thought worth a mention. Down the road from the $1 meal we stumbled upon the visitor centre for this incredible hospital, run solely by charity. The lady so kindly gave us an impromptu private tour of the hospital and explained the history behind it. Go see for yourself, really. 

And that's it! I don't know if anyone will ever see this Reddit post, I probably spent too much time on it anyway but I hope it helps a few people. People like you, the adventurer! Trust your senses and your guts (pun intended again) to help you find the best Cambodian foods!"

10 Reasons to Choose a Reliable YouTube to MP3 Converter,u_theonlineforyou,1i9x41k,2025-01-25 16:09:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1i9x41k/10_reasons_to_choose_a_reliable_youtube_to_mp3/,theonlineforyou,,"When it comes to enjoying your favorite YouTube videos on the go, a YouTube to MP3 converter can be a game-changer. However, not all tools are created equal, and choosing a reliable one ensures you get the best results. Here are 10 reasons why selecting a trustworthy YouTube to MP3 converter is essential.

# 1. High-Quality Audio Downloads

A reliable YouTube to MP3 converter prioritizes audio quality. Whether you're downloading a music video, podcast, or an educational lecture, you want crisp and clear audio that doesn’t compromise the experience. Trustworthy tools ensure the highest bitrate options, often up to 320kbps, for premium sound quality.

# 2. Ease of Use

Nobody wants to deal with a complicated interface. A reliable converter makes the entire process simple and straightforward. From pasting the video link to downloading the MP3 file, every step is intuitive, even for beginners.

# 3. Quick Conversion Speeds

Time is precious, and waiting endlessly for a conversion is frustrating. High-quality converters are optimized for speed, letting you download files within seconds or minutes, even for longer videos.

# 4. No Compromise on Security

Cybersecurity is a critical factor when using online tools. A dependable converter ensures your personal information and device remain safe by eliminating risks of malware, viruses, or phishing attempts. This allows you to download content with peace of mind.

# 5. Supports Multiple Formats

While MP3 is the go-to format for most users, a good converter offers flexibility with additional options such as WAV or FLAC. This adaptability is particularly useful if you're looking to preserve audio quality or work with specific devices.

# 6. Allows Offline Listening

A reliable YouTube to MP3 converter gives you the freedom to enjoy your favorite content offline. Whether you’re traveling, working out, or simply avoiding data charges, offline access to your favorite tracks or podcasts is incredibly convenient.

# 7. Customizable Options

Many reputable converters come with features that allow you to customize your download. You can trim the audio, adjust the bitrate, or select specific segments of a video. This ensures you only download what you need without wasting storage space.

# 8. No Unwanted Ads or Pop-Ups

A major benefit of using a reliable tool is the absence of disruptive ads and pop-ups. The experience is smooth and frustration-free, allowing you to focus on getting your downloads without unnecessary distractions.

# 9. Eco-Friendly Storage Solutions

Converting YouTube videos to MP3 helps save device storage. Instead of downloading large video files, you can opt for smaller audio files. This is particularly useful if you’re running out of space or want to maximize your storage capacity.

# 10. Better Accessibility

Audio files are far more versatile than videos. With MP3s, you can play them across virtually any device, from smartphones and tablets to MP3 players and car audio systems. This flexibility makes a reliable converter an essential tool for any music lover.

# Conclusion

Choosing a dependable YouTube to MP3 converter is about more than just convenience—it's about ensuring you get high-quality, secure, and versatile audio files for your enjoyment. With customizable features, fast downloads, and the ability to take your favorite content offline, a good converter can elevate your listening experience. Opt for tools that prioritize safety, usability, and quality to make the most of your YouTube content."
What is the likelihood that I can use a tuned ECU (ME221) from someone else's car?,Miata,1i9x3rp,2025-01-25 16:08:42,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1i9x3rp/what_is_the_likelihood_that_i_can_use_a_tuned_ecu/,Puzzleheaded-Tax-810,HELP !!!,"Context: I Bought a complete turbo kit that came off a MK2.5, 1.6 Engine (Same as mine), the ME221 has been mapped and done 250bhp. 

The previous owner just had an uprated fuel pump, injectors, and I'm guessing a performance clutch, I have all that

Would it be safe for me to attempt to drive the car on this ECU and kit to a tuners without doing any tuning beforehand to it?, this will be when I fit the complete turbo kit

My mind is telling me it's unsafe, and I'm questioning even if my engine could handle roughly 250 BHP with it being just over half way through its lifespan

But then again it's came off the exact same car, so why wouldn't it be fine? I understand all engines perform slightly different but I don't know lmao.

Cheers in advance.

At first, I knew my manager was “off”, meaning wildly unprofessional but she treated me like a “friend” and I went along with it but her behavior was worse and worse. She would say things about coworkers that are just not ok. Like what she said on their evals, or alluding to mental health issues, or how she would never be a reference if they left because this person was not great at their job now. Over the past year there’s been a shift. I’m really well liked amongst my colleagues and customers. But now it almost feels like I’m too good and she’s trying to take me down a notch. I’m doing all these things and she’ll make subtle remarks “do you really have time for that”. She told our team on our evals this year that people seem to think really highly of themselves and there needs to be more scrutiny, then she wrote completely bullshit feedback on mine but overall I did ok. She asks for my ideas but then somehow she gets upset when I express an opinion. She’s doesn’t read her emails, I have to repeat myself constantly and even if she sort of reads them she still has no idea what’s going on. She immediately attacks: “why didn’t I know about this sooner” when I cc’d her on something within minutes of receiving it. She’s inconsistent in the worst possible way just always changing how she makes decisions. 

She knows I’m looking for another job. I have really good contacts and have been working at getting myself out there but nothing has really happened yet. I feel good about the direction I’m headed but everyday that goes by it’s just never fast enough. I toggle back and forth like overall my job is cushy and the pay is amazing. But then I’ve also felt like I’ve completely outgrown my role and I can’t put up with this bullshit anymore. I wanted to start a project on using something innovative on my team (which is gaining traction in the company itself) and while she let me put it as a goal, I’m not even allowed to talk about it to other team members without putting everything by her first. 

I’m utterly exhausted. I’m also just really, really scared the longer I stay the worst it might get for me. I have a really good reputation but I wouldn’t put anything past her at this point. But I think for now I’m “safe”. 

I don’t know, do I hold out for what I’m considering as my dream transition within the company (that may take another 6 months to a year or more) or do I just seriously start looking for any other job and get out. I’m also based in another country than the rest of my team. Do I start putting out feelers to my coworkers in my home country to see if they can get me out of her grip?

This is affecting my life so much and I don’t know how to not let her complete incompetence get to me. Is it really going to be better on the other side?"
The Mirror People,shortscarystories,1i9x324,2025-01-25 16:07:45,2,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i9x324/the_mirror_people/,SimonOneill87,,"Elara lived by one unbreakable rule: never face a mirror.

Over the years, she’d perfected the routine, moving through life with careful precision. Control was everything—ensuring that not a single moment forced her to confront her reflection. She hadn’t dared to in years. Not since she was a child.

She never lingered on the shine of the sink or the polished edge of a frame. Her husband, James had laughed about it once, teasing her about superstition.

It wasn’t superstition. It was survival.

Now, in Dr. Pierce’s office, her hands shook as she eyed the small hand mirror on the table. Its size made it feel even more dangerous, like something meant to trap her reflection.

She gripped James’s hand tightly.

Dr. Pierce’s voice was calm but firm. “Emersion therapy is about facing what you’ve avoided. You’re safe here.”

James gave her an encouraging smile. “You’ve got this, El.”

But Elara wasn’t so sure. The mirror felt alive, its surface catching the light in a way that made her stomach churn. Slowly, she reached for it, trembling as she clasped the cold metal frame.

Her reflection stared back at her—wide-eyed and pale. It looked normal. For a moment, relief.

Then it moved.

Not in sync—its head tilted on its own, its mouth stretching into a smile too wide for her face. Elara’s heart pounded as her reflection leaned closer to the glass, its eyes glittering with malice.

She couldn’t look away.

When she was eight, her brother, Ben had introduced her to the mirror people. They’d found an antique mirror in their grandmother’s attic, a large, ornate thing that seemed to breathe in the dim light. The mirror people weren’t reflections. They moved freely, independent of her or Ben, their eyes watching, their twisted smiles too eager. Ben had thought it was fun. “Elara, want to play?” he’d asked, laughing as he pressed his hand to the glass, and the mirror people pressed back.

But she hated them. She hated Ben, too. He was their parents’ favorite—the perfect son. She was just an afterthought. The jealousy had simmered until it boiled over.

“Take him,” she’d whispered to the mirror people. “I don’t want him anymore.”

They listened.

“Elara?” Dr. Pierce’s voice jolted her back. “What do you see?”

She couldn’t speak. Her reflection was no longer alone. Behind it, figures emerged, their limbs bending unnaturally, their cracked porcelain skin veined with black. And in their midst stood Ben. His face stretched, his smile jagged.

“Elara,” he called, his voice distorted and cold. “Want to play?”

His hand shot out of the glass, long and clawed, gripping her wrist. She screamed, thrashing as more hands emerged, dragging her toward the mirror. The glass rippled as the mirror people pulled her into their world.

“Elara!” James yelled, grabbing for her. But it was too late.

Her eyes locked on his, her lips forming one final, desperate plea.

The mirror shattered, shards scattering like jagged stars across the floor."
30 [M4M] #USA (Central New York); looking for a date,r4r,1i9x2zf,2025-01-25 16:07:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1i9x2zf/30_m4m_usa_central_new_york_looking_for_a_date/,ExtensionLimit1042,M4M New York,"I'm a Black trans man looking to get to know another man for dating. I'm 5'6"", 250lbs, and completely cis-passing. (But, because I'm a trans man, I am going to have to vet you, hopefully you'll understand that.) I have many interests, but my primary is fishing. Friends & family would describe me as cerebral, trustworthy, and detail-oriented. But contrary to popular belief, I do like to have fun, but the mostly safe and tame type. I'm open to any race, but prefer someone between the ages of 24 and 40. Also, please be single, monogamous, and childless. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from someone!

What to do when caretaker is gone?,ChronicIllness,1i9x2yf,2025-01-25 16:07:37,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1i9x2yf/what_to_do_when_caretaker_is_gone/,Kyliewoo123,Resources,"My partner is my caretaker. I’m at a point where I’m semi independent but need help with meals/house cleaning. If I trigger a flare, I become so weak I can’t move. So I don’t feel safe being alone just yet. (I’ve experienced some dangerous situations being alone and unable to move or call for help)

I haven’t found a good solution for when he needs to be away for a few days. I don’t have other family or friends to help out. I tried to look into home health aids etc but everything seems to be a weekly commitment, not a sporadic weekend to cover a trip

Does anyone have a good plan for this? I really just want my partner and I to feel safe if he needs to leave"
I miss everything single thing about this,motorcycles,1i9x2wq,2025-01-25 16:07:33,11,0.92,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x2wq,younesyounel,,"I had this motorcycle for roughly 6 months.  

It was my first bike, and it was the instrument that helped me create core memories I will never forget.  

Unfortunately, I ran into some problems and had to sell it before moving away from my country with its beautiful weather.  

I miss everything about riding, and I’ve promised myself that I’ll get back to it as soon as I can.  

In the photo, it was the end of a trip when the rain caught me off guard. I had to improvise, and I even loved dealing with those kinds of challenges—rain, mud, wind, and even the occasional fall (of course, while trying to stay safe).  "

Sweetest -

""You make me feel safe""

""I can't think about my future without you in it""

""you should take philosophy classes, because of the way you think""

""I want to grow old with you""

""I'm so lucky"" 

Meanest -

""Fuck you""

""Asshole""

""You're a boy not a man""

(flagrantly offensive comment that hit on a personal level I'm not comfortable sharing - also she was mad she couldn't recall my deceased mother's name so bonus multiplier)

""I've long since moved on"" (4 months post BU)

""What could I possibly use you for?""

""You're the bad ex.""

just interested

Graded these through GameStop !  Surging Sparks + Paldea Evolved PSA Return,pokemoncards,1i9x2na,2025-01-25 16:07:15,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x2na,indeedideed,,"Submission sent on Dec 4th 
- Shipped same day 
- Arrived at PSA Dec 18th 
- Graded update was Jan 23rd and picked up today Jan 25th. (went over a month with no update, just exercise patience)

Happy overall with the experience and already have a few other sets of cards going through the process. 

I graded a lot of these cards for the PC. Really enjoy the idea of keeping cards I pull myself even if most I knew were not PSA 10s. Got back into the hobby last year after Paldea Evolved released and have been holding these in binders. After I opened some surging sparks in early December, decided to slab some of the collection through the GameStop service and see how it would go. 

Any feedback on the cards is appreciated, all grades seem fair to me but I am a newer collector with no plans on selling so if it may make sense to crack/resubmit I would look into it. All 9s have some mistake I noted before sending, just happy they are safe in slabs now. ( Ceruledge is my favorite modern, have the IR from SS getting graded now ! ) ….. atleast the Latios and latias are seq 9s right :/ "
