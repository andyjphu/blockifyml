Why do people love to hate me?,astrologyreadings,1i9xesc,2025-01-25 16:22:19,2,1.0,1,https://i.redd.it/0561y1ryi7fe1.jpeg,lasoupecbon,Reading,"Throughout my life, I've often encountered people who dislike me without having spoken to me much‚Äîsometimes not at all. They form strong assumptions about me and believe them to be true, despite the fact that our limited interactions shouldn‚Äôt warrant such opinions. This has always puzzled me. Over the years, I‚Äôve lost friends who seemed to turn against me out of nowhere, even though I never spoke ill of them. It's strange because I also experience the opposite effect with many people; some seem to take an instant liking to me and remain incredibly loyal, leading to many long-term friendships.

Last year, a number of people turned against me for something I never did. They convinced themselves I was responsible while maintaining friendships with those who actually committed the act they accused me of. I suspect that misogyny and racism played a role in how easily they turned on me, especially since they didn‚Äôt react the same way toward others who were male or white males. This pattern has followed me throughout my life, and now I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a spiritual explanation for it.

Many people have commented on my unique energy and charm, sometimes describing my aura as unsettling. I have been described as ""intense"" in both good and bad. I can see what they mean; there has often been drama surrounding me, even when I played a minimal role in it. Yet, I‚Äôve also experienced intense moments of passion and closeness with others. Strangers tend to be exceptionally kind to me, and I always seem to have interesting anecdotes to share. I'm curious if someone could read my astrological chart to shed light on these aspects of my life and whether there are any insights related to these issues. "

Every Starter Solo Run! Mankey! Third win in a row! 24/587,pokerogue,1i9xcwq,2025-01-25 16:20:01,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xcwq,Comfortable_Aspect32,Showcase,"Hey everyone! KC here!

Today we talking about Mankey! The well beloved Mankey. He has everything. He's cool af, his PokeRogue special shines are cool af, he has nice egg moves, nice passive... And God look at Annihilape, that mon is crazy cool!

As I said, Mankey has a really good passive, Iron Fist, with a nice egg move to abuse it, Drain Punch, which is one of the best non setup moves in the game for this challenge. It also gets Meteor Mash, also procs Iron First and covers against Fairy Types, Slack Off, which, to be honest, there's no need at all for it, you already heal up Drain Punch, I think another punch move or priority move would be more appropriate in this spot. It's rare egg move, it's a CRAZY one, No Retreat. But, as always, I didn't have it! :) Game just refuses to give me the rare egg moves I may start going for that machine on the gacha lol As abilities, it gets Vital Spirit, which is the one I went with, Anger Point and Defiant (Didn't have it either).

So I'm not going to lose much of your time today, this run was as easy as walking. I run Drain Punch/Fire Punch(TM)/Meteor Mash/Rage Fist, later in the run I got in Thunder Punch taking out Fire Punch, to cover against Flying Types, and much more later, wave 100+, I got Bulk Up which I swapped with Meteor Mash.

Every single fight, it just did what it's name is about, Punching. Punching and 1HKO'ing the opponents, even without booting. When I got Bulk Up and I could boost, it was just a matter of finding the spot for setting up. It was really crucial since Ray was an issue.

Managed to beat Ivy at 145 after boosting a bit, and managed to beat her at 195 after Ray's hurricane miss into Ivy changing him. That's was actually a hard one since she was bringing up Ray first turn, and had to find a way out of there. 

Team Plasma was really easy, making me so happy to obliterate the GMax Copperajah who has been a menace the whole challenge. Elite 4 and champion were also pretty easy.

For Eternatus, I didn't have Confide, Amnesia or No Retreat, so I went the hardcore way. I learned Curse but I didn't use, since I was able to use Bulk Up to +6 because Eternatus was kind of messing around with his attacks, and my lefties were enough to survive. Went with Rage Fist, into second stage, another one, just 1 HP bar left, full HP with Shell Bells and one last Rage Fist to finish the run.

This was a really chill run, appreciate it after some more stressful runs we've been having. This was streamed on Twitch, If you don't wanna miss out, you can follow me [here](https://twitch.tv/ImWorthy13). You can also check the current challenge stats [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_z7T1z8iPXh7IW348YI3CPLpdVxGvqb9yfBiHhfmzs/edit?usp=drivesdk), where Mankey has gone directly into the Hall of Fame, putting Fighting and Ghost type straight into the top of typings.

Much love, take care and see you soon!"

I wanted to share a personal finance tool that‚Äôs been super helpful for staying on top of money management. It‚Äôs an all-in-one dashboard where you can track income, expenses, savings, and investments in a simple, straightforward way. Whether you‚Äôre budgeting, tackling debt, or working towards big financial goals, this dashboard makes it easier to keep everything organized.

# Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what it does:

* **Transactions Tab**: Record income and expenses, and it handles the math for you.
* **Monthly & Yearly Dashboards**: See where you stand each month and over the year.
* **Calendar View**: Track daily spending visually.
* **Customizable Categories**: Adjust it to fit your needs.
* **Summary Overview**: Get a big-picture look at your financial health.

It‚Äôs been very helpful for many people in reducing the stress of managing finances. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to simplify money tracking or just want to get a clearer picture of your finances and understand where your money is being spent, I think this could be really useful.

Raids Crashing after Grand Prix Update.,Crossout,1i9xb9g,2025-01-25 16:18:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crossout/comments/1i9xb9g/raids_crashing_after_grand_prix_update/,marcuszwarg,,"Hello everyone. I am here to show what me and several players who plays raids have been experiencing since the last update.

I have recorded several videos and posted unlisted on youtube, with detailed descriptions and timestamps.

[https://youtu.be/g\_ttBXWrQ9c](https://youtu.be/g_ttBXWrQ9c) \- 01 Double Cyclone (Recording since glitch)  
[https://youtu.be/h9SEvCdKsFI](https://youtu.be/h9SEvCdKsFI) \- 02 Mandrake (Glitch at 6:05)

[https://youtu.be/05Isdc2tb-Y](https://youtu.be/05Isdc2tb-Y) \- 06 Triple Cyclone (Glitch at 4:00)

The gliches start after a few minutes into raids.  
Projectiles start acting funny, disappearing, getting stuck in the air, sticking to surfaces.  
Physics start getting weird. Enemy cars bounce and clip on the terrain, their pieces disappear.  
After a few more minutes after the glitches start, the game crashes to desktop.  
It seems that the time it does crash, and if depends on the lenght of the game and volume of projectiles.

This started happening after the Grand Prix update.  
The raids worked normally before the update.  
Many users in general chat also report the exact same issue.  
There is a Crossout Forum post with the same issue here:   
[https://forum.crossout.net/t/crash-in-raids-after-grand-prix-update/26566](https://forum.crossout.net/t/crash-in-raids-after-grand-prix-update/26566)  
Random people i played with also confirmed having those issues.  
Both my friends whom i play raids with in a daily basis also have this issue.  
Moreover, they crash at the exact same time as me. We live in separate states and use different ISPs.



This happens around 75% of the time. Every 4 matches, 3 will glitch and crash.  
Sometimes the glitch happens close to the end of the and it doesn't crash, but it's very random/lucky.The same thing happen whilst playing on any server: US, EU and RU.  
This happens on any raid type and any map.



PS.

Please do not be offended by the following:  
With all due respect, i build computers for a living, and i know what i am doing.  
My system is modern, powerful, properly maintained and updated.  
I do not need nor want tech tips/assistance with my computer/windows/game settings.  
I am reporting a glitch that MANY people are having. I am doing a service for the community.  
I already spent days troubleshooting my system with the best of my knowledge.  
I did a full uninstall, folder, settings of crossout then did a fresh install.  
I even built a virtual machine with only crossout installed, and the glitch happened there.  
I play several other games with no issues at all. BF2042, Diablo 4, Starcraft 2, Escape Tarkov, Division 2, to name a few.  
I wasted an afternoon of my time after several frustated gaming sessions with my friends because of this glitch, i feel very upset, and i will not appreciate jokes, trolling, sarcasm, provocation, etc. I even doxxxed myself because of how upset i was when i did the first video and uploaded an uncut version where personal information and desktop icons leaked. It was super frustrating.

Therefore, for those reasons, i might completely ignore such replies. Thank you."

Planning a Holiday Week in Spain: Advice Needed for Barcelona and Madrid Trip!,GoingToSpain,1i9xabl,2025-01-25 16:16:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1i9xabl/planning_a_holiday_week_in_spain_advice_needed/,belikerich,,"Hi everyone!

We're planning a week-long trip to Spain and want to visit both Barcelona and Madrid. Our flight arrives in **Gerona (Girona) Airport** and departs from there as well. We would really appreciate your advice on a few things and some general tips for our itinerary!

# Questions:

1. **Getting from Gerona Airport to Barcelona:**
   * What‚Äôs the quickest/cheapest option to get to Barcelona?
   * Are there more comfortable (but slightly more expensive) options?
2. **Where to stay in Barcelona:**
   * Can you recommend a good neighbourhood or area to stay that‚Äôs close to the train station? We‚Äôre planning to take an early morning train to Madrid on our second day.
3. **Booking return train tickets (Barcelona ‚Üî Madrid):**
   * Which company or platform is the best to book return tickets? Are there any deals or tips we should know about?
4. **Time split between Barcelona and Madrid:**
   * Would you recommend splitting the six non-travel days evenly between Barcelona and Madrid? Or should we spend more time in one city?

# Draft Itinerary:

* **Saturday, 15 March:** Flight from Weeze ‚Üí Gerona ‚Üí Barcelona (Arrival in Gerona Airport at 17:00)
* **Sunday, 16 March:** Early train from Barcelona ‚Üí Madrid
* **Wednesday, 19 March:** Train from Madrid ‚Üí Barcelona
* **Saturday, 22 March:** Barcelona ‚Üí Gerona ‚Üí Weeze (Departure from Gerona Airport at 12:25)

We‚Äôre aiming to make the most out of our time in both cities, and any help with logistics, neighbourhoods, or must-see spots would be amazing! Thanks in advance for your advice. :)"

I wanted to share a personal finance tool that‚Äôs been super helpful for staying on top of money management. It‚Äôs an all-in-one dashboard where you can track income, expenses, savings, and investments in a simple, straightforward way. Whether you‚Äôre budgeting, tackling debt, or working towards big financial goals, this dashboard makes it easier to keep everything organized.

# Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what it does:

* **Transactions Tab**: Record income and expenses, and it handles the math for you.
* **Monthly & Yearly Dashboards**: See where you stand each month and over the year.
* **Calendar View**: Track daily spending visually.
* **Customizable Categories**: Adjust it to fit your needs.
* **Summary Overview**: Get a big-picture look at your financial health.

It‚Äôs been very helpful for many people in reducing the stress of managing finances. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to simplify money tracking or just want to get a clearer picture of your finances and understand where your money is being spent, I think this could be really useful.

What makes this album extra special to me, I share it's birthday!

See you for Starboy Monday!
