Time to sell? Analyst warns of some cryptocurrencies ripe for crashes,CapitalistExploits,1hwsnor,2025-01-08 14:30:43,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hwsnor/time_to_sell_analyst_warns_of_some/,kayakero,,"The cryptocurrency market is bracing for a wave of token unlocks that could significantly impact several altcoins. It is estimated that around $4 billion worth of altcoins will be available for trading in the coming weeks, including major names such as Sui (SUI), Optimism (OP), and Aptos (APT).

While these breakouts may represent buying opportunities for some investors, one analyst warns that certain altcoins could face considerable declines.

# Sui Network

The first prominent name on the list is Sui Network, a layer-1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer applications. On January 1, 2025, the protocol released 64.19 million SUI tokens, equivalent to 2.13% of its circulating supply and valued at approximately $267 million.

Analyst Lawrence Mike Woriji notes that while SUI has shown signs of recovery recently, the token unlocking could put pressure on the price, resulting in a moderate drop.

However, with a solid Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1,662 million, the network demonstrates long-term growth potential.

# Cryptocurrencies at risk of collapse

Another network on the radar is Movement Labs, which uses the Move programming language. This network plans a major unlock of 50 million MOVE tokens on January 9th.

Despite a 30% increase in its price over the past 30 days, MOVE fell by 15% in the past week. This behavior could indicate vulnerability to a significant drop after unlocking.

Uncertainty over the impact of this release has created caution among investors, especially given Movement Labs' focus on expansion and collaborations.

Aptos (APT), on the other hand, will release 11.31 million tokens (equivalent to $104 million) on January 11, 2025. Aptos has already seen a 30% drop in the past 30 days, and this unlocking is expected to increase the downward pressure on its price.

# Token Unlocks: Trends and Warnings

Historically, token unlocks have caused significant price fluctuations. For example, last November, a 13.4% drop was recorded in the market following a major unlock event. With the altcoin market facing challenges, the trend is for steep declines following the release of $APT, making this moment an opportunity to sell ahead of the unlock.

Without a doubt, the most significant event of January will be the unlocking of Ondo Finance (ONDO). On January 18, 2025, 1.94 billion ONDO tokens will be released , representing 19.4% of its maximum supply and valued at $2.85 billion.

Analysts suggest that due to the magnitude of this release, ONDO prices could fall drastically. Therefore, investors are advised to sell their positions on January 16 or 17 to maximize profits before the drop.

A strategy of buying at discounted prices could be advantageous following these unlocking events.

Staking Explained in Simple Terms: What It Is and How Beginners Can Earn,u_Ok_Note8852,1hvp53e,2025-01-07 06:11:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Note8852/comments/1hvp53e/staking_explained_in_simple_terms_what_it_is_and/,Ok_Note8852,,"In traditional finance, a popular way to earn passive income is by keeping money in bank deposits or low-risk investments in bonds. This approach helps grow capital and generate stable returns in the long term. Digital asset holders do not have access to these options, but they can earn through staking — a mechanism that allows users to earn rewards by contributing to the security of a given network.

In this article, we will explain what staking is, how it works, the advantages it can offer investors, and the risks involved.

https://preview.redd.it/1xu7ktmi1kbe1.jpg?width=2600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b6f20bc05e4cdde2acbd5082eee55f8b245028

# What is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm that powers blockchain operations, transaction verification, and network protection from malicious actors. It was designed as a more energy-efficient and scalable alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security is ensured by computational power. In PoS, tokens become the main resource for participating in consensus. Participants lock their assets to become validators, and the network selects those who will verify transactions and add new blocks. The chances of becoming a validator depend on the number of locked tokens, as well as other factors such as staking duration and randomness.

To ensure validator loyalty, PoS uses a penalty mechanism known as ""slashing."" If a network participant violates the rules, their assets can be partially or fully confiscated.

Due to these features, Proof-of-Stake has become a key element of modern blockchains, offering an energy-efficient solution for maintaining consensus and making participation accessible to any token holder. Staking is at the core of PoS.

# What is Native Staking?

Native staking is the process of locking cryptocurrency directly in a blockchain to support its operation and earn rewards. Participants in native staking can also become validators, helping verify transactions, create new blocks, and maintain network security. To participate in native staking, a special wallet and a minimum number of tokens are usually required, depending on the blockchain's requirements.

However, locking assets for staking does not automatically grant validator status. Validators must also launch their own nodes, so for users who cannot or do not want to do this, the option to delegate their tokens is available. They transfer assets to one of the validators via specialized platforms and receive a portion of their reward.

# Liquid Staking and Restaking

Modern approaches to utilizing tokens to support blockchains, in addition to native staking, include two key trends: liquid staking and restaking. These expand the possibilities of using staked assets, making the process more flexible and profitable.

Liquid staking allows users to lock their assets to support the network in exchange for liquid tokens that represent their staked assets. These tokens can be used in DeFi protocols for earning, trading, or investing. Thus, liquid staking solves the issue of asset freezing that is typical of traditional staking. Restaking is a mechanism that allows users to reuse assets already locked in staking. It is applied to secure additional networks or protocols.

For example, in the EigenLayer project, Ethereum validators can offer their staked tokens to secure new decentralized applications, cross-chain bridges, or oracles. In return, they earn additional rewards.

However, restaking also carries higher risks: validators may face penalties if they violate the rules of the additional protocols, potentially losing assets.

# Staking vs. Farming and Mining

Staking, farming, and mining are three different approaches to earning in the crypto industry, with distinct goals, requirements, and risks. However, beginners often confuse them, perceiving them as similar methods of earning passive income through digital assets.

It's important to remember that staking is considered a more eco-friendly solution for securing a blockchain compared to mining. In both cases, users can actively participate in the network, but mining requires powerful hardware that consumes a significant amount of electricity. In PoS networks, validators only need to lock their tokens to help secure the network.

Farming (or yield farming) has a different nature but often involves ""staking,"" i.e., locking assets. In this case, users freeze their tokens in smart contracts to provide liquidity to decentralized protocols, such as exchanges or lending platforms.

Rewards from farming are often paid in governance tokens or transaction fees. Unlike staking, farming is not related to network security. Instead, it is used to provide liquidity or other functions in DeFi. However, farming carries additional risks, including impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets locked in pools fluctuate.

This comparison helps understand which method is best suited for a user's specific goals.

# Advantages and Risks of Staking

**Main Benefits of Staking:**

* **Passive income:** Locked tokens continue to work for their owner, earning rewards without requiring active involvement. This makes staking especially attractive for long-term investors.
* **Network support:** Through staking, users help ensure the security and stability of the blockchain, becoming an integral part of its ecosystem.
* **Accessibility:** Staking does not require expensive equipment. All that is needed is cryptocurrency and the appropriate software.

**Risks and Drawbacks of Staking:**

* **Market volatility:** The value of tokens can drop sharply, leading to losses that may outweigh the earned rewards.
* **Technical risks:** Assets may be lost due to errors in smart contracts, hacking attacks, or loss of access to a wallet. These risks increase when using intermediary providers.
* **Inaccessibility of tokens:** Locked assets cannot be used, limiting liquidity and the ability to sell quickly. Liquid staking platforms are an exception.
* **Slashing risk:** In case of errors or malicious actions by the validator, part of the staked assets may be confiscated as a penalty. This can apply both to the user and to the validator they delegated their assets to.

Many of these risks can be minimized with a careful approach, such as choosing reliable providers or delegating assets to trustworthy validators with a good reputation and high reward shares. It's also important to monitor the state of the crypto market and the price dynamics of the selected asset.

# Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Staking

Shaikh, who helped launch the layer-1 blockchain in October 2022, will remain with the company as a strategic adviser.

In a Dec. 19 statement, Shaikh expressed confidence in Aptos' future, highlighting its talented team and vision. Under his leadership, Aptos raised $400 million from prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and Haun Ventures and established partnerships with major firms, including BlackRock, Google, and Mastercard.

Ching, now CEO, aims to drive Aptos into its next phase of growth, focusing on technical innovation and expanding its global developer ecosystem in regions like India, Vietnam, and South Korea. Aptos' blockchain, built on the Move programming language, continues to prioritize scalability and security, positioning itself as a key competitor to Ethereum and Solana.

Despite the leadership transition, the APT token remains largely unaffected, holding a $6.4 billion market cap and ranking as the 31st largest cryptocurrency."
Aptos (APT) Price Recovers 15% After $2 Billion Market Cap Loss,Blockmandev,1hd4bhi,2024-12-12 23:26:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1hd4bhi/aptos_apt_price_recovers_15_after_2_billion/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Aptos ($APT) is flexing some serious recovery muscles, surging nearly 15% in just 24 hours! After a dramatic $2 billion drop in market cap ahead of its $134M token unlock, $APT is defying bearish signals like a death cross and a 10% plunge to hint at a possible trend reversal.

Technical indicators are lighting up with optimism. The Ichimoku Cloud reveals $APT trading above the cloud—a bullish signal—with a potential retest of $15 if the momentum holds. But traders should keep a close eye on the key support at $13.38; any drop below could spark another correction.

Looking at the DMI chart, $APT's ADX has dropped from 42 to 32.96, signaling weaker trend strength; however, it still hovers above 25, suggesting moderate bullish potential. Meanwhile, a D+ crossover above D- points to a possible short-term recovery if buying pressure holds steady.

EMA lines also bring intrigue to the table. Following a recent death cross and subsequent 10% price drop, $APT is now on the verge of forming a bullish crossover. If this plays out, we could see targets around $14.88 or $15.34. On the flip side, a breakdown could bring $APT down to $12.3.

Aptos appears to be dancing the fine line between recovery and resistance as it shakes off a tough couple of days. Will the bulls take $APT to $15, or will bears drag it back into the trenches? Stay tuned.

Massive Altcoin Unlocks in December: Hold Onto Your Bags,WhiteRhinoMarketWatch,1h6tsab,2024-12-04 17:53:04,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRhinoMarketWatch/comments/1h6tsab/massive_altcoin_unlocks_in_december_hold_onto/,MrsSOsbourne,,"December’s shaping up to be a wild ride in the crypto world with some *serious* token unlocks coming our way. If you’re holding these coins, or just love watching the chaos unfold, here’s what’s about to hit the market:

▫️ **#IMX** \- $28.61M: Not earth-shattering, but enough to ripple through the NFT space.  
▫️ **#JTO** \- $531M: This one? Big. The kind of unlock that makes whales grin and retail traders panic.  
▫️ **#GMT** \- $20.7M: A modest unlock for your favorite ""move-to-earn"" ecosystem.  
▫️ **#ENS** \- $38.25M: Web3 naming rights are getting a payday.  
▫️ **#APT** \- $153M: Aptos holders better buckle up. That's a *lot* of new supply.  
▫️ **#ARB** \- $90M: Arbitrum’s still riding its Layer-2 hype wave, but $90M unlocked is no joke.  
▫️ **#ZETA** \- $283.22M: This? Monster unlock. Keep an eye on how the market digests it.  
▫️ **#OP** \- $79.89M: Optimism lives up to its name, but how optimistic will traders feel after this unlock?

Here’s the thing: Token unlocks can play havoc with prices, especially if big holders decide to dump. It’s not *always* bad news — depends on how the market absorbs the supply — but don’t be the one caught without a strategy. Keep your eyes on these unlocks, and maybe, just maybe, keep a little dry powder on the side.

Timing is everything, and in December, the clock is ticking for these altcoins.

But this briefer should serve as all you need to understand why so many are looking to Hedera when it comes to real world use & adoption of DLT.

It's far more than just crypto... In fact crypto's just 1 vertical out of many developing on Hedera.

This is real world use of DLT on full display.

5 Altcoins You Should Watch in December 2024,Blockmandev,1h4027b,2024-12-01 04:56:57,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1h4027b/5_altcoins_you_should_watch_in_december_2024/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: December historically brings the crypto fire, and December 2024 is shaping up to be no different. All eyes are on altcoins with major catalysts this month that could send prices soaring. BeInCrypto has spotlighted five standout altcoins, and trust me, you don’t want to miss this lineup.

First up, the new kid in the game, $HYPE, has already gained over 200% since launching just last week. Despite not being listed on any centralized exchange, its daily volumes are popping off! If momentum holds, it's one to watch as the year wraps up.  

Then we have $SUI, flexing strong gains yet again, up 75% in the past 30 days. With a massive $210M token unlock on the horizon, all signs point to some bullish price action this month. History, moving averages, and a loyal fan base are all working in its favor. But watch out for that selling pressure.

$FTM is bringing the heat ahead of its much-hyped Sonic Mainnet upgrade. Price is already pushing $1, and if bulls keep control, it could be poised to scale new heights. However, strong hands are crucial to keep this momentum alive.

Enter $APT, which shares a playbook with $SUI. A token unlock worth $135M is lined up, and historically, Aptos thrives post-unlock. If ascending triangular patterns hold steady, December could be merry for $APT holders.

Let’s not forget $BONK, the king of Solana meme coins. With a massive pre-Christmas token burn in the works, supply shrinkage could fuel a price spike. But volatility could ruin the party if whales cash out early.

The big question: Will the December crypto vibes hold? As always, do your own research and stay sharp out there.

Teaming up with Circle and Stripe, the Aptos Foundation is ready to revolutionize its ecosystem with enhanced interoperability and streamlined TradFi access.

Circle brings its USDC stablecoin and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to the table, enabling seamless movement of assets across Aptos and eight major blockchains. On the other hand, Stripe is making its grand crypto comeback by simplifying fiat-to-crypto interactions with its payment services, including smoother on-ramps and off-ramps. This could be the ultimate magnet for TradFi players eyeing the blockchain space.

While Aptos is determined to build the ultimate hub for interoperable DeFi, the $APT token’s recent price action tells a story of stagnation amid a broader market rally. With these ambitious integrations, Aptos might just regain its footing and work toward establishing itself as a leader in both DeFi and enterprise-grade blockchain.

Stay tuned because this could signal a turning point for the network’s trajectory in 2024. Let’s see how these bold moves play out for Aptos and its community!

### Shift in​ Cryptocurrency Markets Amid U.S. Electoral Uncertainties

Unpredictable Ripples Through Crypto Trading as Elections⁣ ApproachIn ⁢a volatile day of​ trading that encapsulated the nerves and ⁣uncertainties surrounding ⁣the final stages of the U.S. elections, cryptocurrency markets experienced dramatic fluctuations. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) saw an impressive climb to $70,500 ‍from an initial $67,000 only to ​encounter a swift ⁣2% decline within an hour, eventually stabilizing around $69,000—still marking a more than 2% rise within 24 hours. This event ‌underscores the skittish nature of crypto markets in times of political flux.

During this same timeframe, broader market indices also ⁢reflected gains with heightened activity particularly noted in certain cryptocurrencies. ⁣The CoinDesk 20 Index observed ⁤a 3%⁣ increase propelled by significant upticks⁣ in specific digital assets ⁣like​ Near (NEAR), ‍Aptos (APT), and Hedera ⁤(HBAR), each climbing by about 6%-7%.

Market Movements: Specific Highlights amidst Broader TrendsThis period also witnessed intriguing developments across different cryptocurrencies and‌ tokens:

  - Reports emerged indicating a surge above $65K for Bitcoin following comments made by former President Trump regarding decentralized finance token sales.
  - The phenomenon labeled “Uptober,” fueled by escalating stablecoin liquidity and ⁢skyrocketing Bitcoin transactions.
  - A ‌notable breach past​ the $64K threshold for Bitcoin ⁣coincided with parallel ascents observed in gold prices.
  - Confirmation⁤ of ‌plans for new cryptocurrency ⁣projects endorsed by prominent figures highlighted interconnectedness between ‍traditional ‌political movements and emerging financial technologies.

Contrastingly,​ Ether (ETH) struggled to keep pace with its contemporaries; its relative performance index against bitcoin dipping below 0.035—the lowest since⁤ April 2021—with just modest daily gains reported at approximately 0.4%, while litecoin’s (LTC) movement remained largely unchanged.

External Influences on⁢ Cryptocurrency Performance: Corporate and Political DynamicsAdding depth to the market’s brisk dynamics was news from Trump Media & Technology Group which operates Truth‍ Social—a platform closely‌ affiliated with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump—experiencing a stark drop of nearly 20%. The temporary halt on trading ⁣sparked intense speculation among investors about underlying causes even though predictive measures didn’t show substantial changes concerning election outcomes—the likelihood pegged barely⁤ moving from previously marked percentages.

Beyond ​these immediate fluctuations lies broader anticipation towards electoral ‌results expected later this ⁤week; traders are seemingly poised for quick adjustments based ‍upon final tallies where victories either way could prompt sharp reactions across global financial platforms ​including that amassed under cryptocurrencies.

This expectant view⁤ aligns with predictions from QCP Digital Asset Hedge Fund noting⁢ potential post-election volatility depending on either halted proceedings or extended wait periods reminiscent of scenarios such as those experienced during confrontations over results back in early this millennium—a ‍projection not least supported because ⁤past parallels can indeed inform future precautions among participant observers ⁢within these evolving asset classes spanning considerable portions​ worldwide when both scope and⁢ scale are accounted fully under prevailing circumstances today continuing forward into similar seasonally induced episodes naturally echoing earlier episodes at least retrospectively if not immediately clear initially at outset necessarily completely or wholly without exceptions eventually developing gradually once again typically thus repeating cycles consistently observed historically previously altogether once more anew inevitably reoccurring‍ time after time recurrently as patterns form perpetuating themselves continually throughout‍ while ensuring sustained attention remains fixated intently upon actions undertaken specifically aiming toward preempting‍ disruptions amid ongoing processes fundamentally‌ integral toward safeguarding stability generally prevalent overall ⁤collectively oriented toward maintaining orderly operations across ‌all spheres involved globally comprehensively throughout universally essentially central‌ fundamentally crucial especially critical under contextually specific conditions assessed critically important universally recognized foundational inherently vital substantively meaningful relevant explicitly significant core essential persistently consequential continuously relevant omnipresent centerpiece focal point critically urgent enduring ongoing imperative continuously paramount enduring‌ indispensable persistently pivotal ​critically overwhelming priority universally imperative continuously paramount concern foremost ​significance encompassing everything related practically intimately intertwined indivisible indistinguishable inseparable interlinked integrally intertwined intrinsically⁢ embedded inseparably connected indelibly bound indefatigably linked intrinsically belonging interdependently allied interconnected inevitably⁢ involving invariably implicating invariably impacting undeniably influencing undeniably affecting unarguably​ altering unquestionably changing indisputably ⁣shaping irrevocably guiding indomitably driving irresistibly compelling⁣ unfailingly determining unmistak LINK_CHARACTER_LIMIT_PER_MESSAGE

Best perform Crypto Sectors last week.,CryptoMars,1g8qfx2,2024-10-21 10:02:52,17,0.96,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1g8qfx2/best_perform_crypto_sectors_last_week/,tsurutatdk,DISCUSSION,"Last week, the crypto space witnessed decent growth in price, which was more reflected in Bitcoin. You would agree with me that crypto is not just about the chain—it goes beyond the chain and includes various assets.

Let’s take a look at some of the biggest crypto categories and how they performed over the last week:

**Memecoins – Up 19.9%**

This area of Web3 serves little to no purpose but has become increasingly popular due to speculation and hype. Memecoins were up nearly 20%, reaching $62.1 billion in the seven days leading up to Friday, Oct. 18. Tokens like Book of MEME (BOME), TURBO, and Cat In A Dogs World (MEW) enjoyed weekly rises of more than 50%, indicating that crypto is in a strong place right now.


**L1s (Blockchains) – Up 11.3%**

Layer 1s are the largest Web3 category by market cap, worth over $1.8 trillion, with 68% of that made up of Bitcoin. The price of BTC is likely to continue surging as net flows into BTC ETFs increase. Earlier last week, there was a net inflow of over $1.8 billion.

**DePIN – Up 24.4%**

DePIN solutions allow blockchain technology to interact with physical infrastructure in industries like storage, communications, and energy. As one of this year’s crypto buzz sectors, DePIN coins and tokens had a great week, rising nearly 25% to $23 billion. We may see more growth if speculation continues and if the likes of Peaq launch this month or next. With over 46+ DePIN projects building on the chain, substantial funds have already been raised for token launches. If Peaq, one of the key DePIN-focused L1s, goes live, we may witness many of these solutions launching. This sector has solid potential and room for more growth.

**Proof-of-Stake – Up 8.8%**

The Proof-of-Stake sector climbed 8.8% to $549.9 billion last week, driven by an Aptos (APT) token unlock and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin laying out his goals for Ethereum’s Surge.

**L2 Scaling Solutions – Up 6%**

Layer-2 solutions saw a solid performance last week, growing to $19.5 billion, partly due to Bitcoin Layer-2 Stacks (STX) being listed on the Nexo crypto exchange and many others as well. 

I hope this week brings even more promising developments and price action to last week.

Top Altcoins for October 2024!,Crypto_General,1g51o70,2024-10-16 11:10:28,2,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1g51o70/top_altcoins_for_october_2024/,Theodaud,Daily Discussion,"
October has once again proven to be a hot month for the crypto market, with several standout altcoins surging in both price and popularity. Aptos (APT) and Solana (SOL) are among the top rising digital assets, alongside a new ERC20 altcoin that's gaining attention, Rollblock (RBLK).

These three assets are showing incredible growth potential amidst the ongoing market uptrend.

Rollblock (RBLK)
Rollblock (RBLK) has quickly become one of the most sought-after ERC20 tokens this year, primarily due to its focus on merging decentralized and centralized gambling technology through the GambleFi protocol.

This project offers full transparency to users, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of the gambling ecosystem without needing KYC verification.

RBLK tokens are designed with a continuous burn mechanism, a fixed supply of one billion tokens, and a staking program that provides long-term rewards. This makes Rollblock not only a utility token but also a potential asset for significant growth. Currently, Rollblock is in its seventh presale round, priced at US$0.031, and analysts project that the token could rise up to 100x following its official launch.

Aptos (APT)
Aptos (APT) has also garnered attention after seeing a price increase of 112% over the past two months, rising from a 52-week low of US$4.34 to a market cap of US$4.64 billion.

One of the main factors driving this surge is interest from major institutions like Franklin Templeton, which has integrated its FOBXX fund, valued at US$435 million, on the Aptos blockchain.

Technical indicators support Aptos’ rally as well. The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has crossed above the 200-day EMA, creating a strong bullish signal. If this trend continues, many investors predict that Aptos will keep rising, even amid broader crypto market volatility.

Solana (SOL)
After weeks of stagnation, Solana (SOL) is finally showing signs of revival. SOL has broken through a key resistance level at the 100-day EMA, boosting investor confidence that SOL is ready for its next bullish phase. Market sentiment around Solana has turned increasingly positive, with price targets between US$160 and US$170 as the next resistance levels.

If SOL can hold above US$150 and break through US$170, analysts predict that Solana could soon reach US$200. Support from its community and increased adoption of Solana's blockchain technology across various sectors are also crucial in boosting the asset’s value.

Bullish Outlook for October
With all three of these altcoins performing exceptionally well, investors are advised to closely monitor the progress of Aptos, Solana, and Rollblock. October is often a favorable month for the crypto market, and the current bullish momentum could provide significant returns for those who invest at the right time.

Top memecoins dump up to 9% in 1 hour as Bitcoin falls less than 0.5%,EVRAZ,1g4a50k,2024-10-15 11:16:36,3,1.0,4,https://i.redd.it/c6sk2jmqsxud1.jpeg,milutin_milosh,,"Bitcoin steady at $65,470 as memecoins plummet with market shifts.

Bitcoin’s price remains steady at $65,470.25, marking a 0.82% increase over the past 24 hours, while several memecoins experience declines, according to CryptoSlate data.

However, Bitcoin’s price declined by 0.34% in the past hour, with memecoins facing sharper drops: First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) fell 8.92% to $0.002033, with a market cap of $855 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $678 million.

BOOK OF MEME (BOME) decreased by 4.57%, now at $0.009826. Aptos (APT) and Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) saw 1-hour losses of 3.83% and 3.80%, respectively. Mog Coin (MOG) slipped 3.05% to $0.051865, while Pepe (PEPE) dropped 2.75% to $0.0000103.

Other assets, like leading memecoins Dogwifhat (WIF) also declined by 2.42% Popcat (SOL) (POPCAT) decreased 2.39% to $1.34.

Investors appear to be moving away from high-risk memecoins amid the downturn. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $38.3 billion, indicating sustained interest despite the slight dip.
