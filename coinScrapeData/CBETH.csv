The team and community are still as active as ever every day, making banger memes and dominating attention.  
  
All while ETH has experienced the worst FUD it ever has and seen intense price depression in relation to its peers.  
  
The ETH narrative is changing.  The amount of ETH that World Liberty is buying up is a clear indication of the direction that policy is going to go in the USA.  Top ETH betas are likely to receive massive tail winds from any bullish ETH news coming from the current administration.  
  
Coinbase is ramping up their base advertising and working hard to bring the world to their L2.  Again MOG stands to benefit heavily from this being one of the biggest tokens available on base and the cheapest coin on coinbase.  
  
On the speculative side, MOG stands one of the best chances of addition to [u/RobinhoodApp](https://x.com/RobinhoodApp) and [@binance](https://x.com/binance) spot.  
  
Maybe I'm wrong, but [@mogcoin](https://x.com/mogcoin)  feels like a buy here.

Vitalik Buterin Unveils Ethereum‚Äôs Scaling Roadmap For 2025 And Beyond,Blockviews,1i9v1uy,2025-01-25 14:37:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i9v1uy/vitalik_buterin_unveils_ethereums_scaling_roadmap/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Vitalik Buterin Unveils Ethereum‚Äôs Grand Scaling Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond  

Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, just dropped a game-changing blog post outlining the future of the network, and it's packed with ambitious upgrades. The Ethereum roadmap is laser-focused on enhancing scalability, security, and sustainability, all while keeping decentralization intact.  

For Layer 1, sharding takes center stage with Phase 3 upgrades aiming to supercharge Ethereum‚Äôs capacity to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. In addition, Verifiable Delay Functions are set to refine its proof-of-stake consensus, bolstering security like never before.  

Layer 2 solutions aren‚Äôt left out either. Buterin plans to level up Optimistic and ZK-Rollups, creating a flexible off-chain transaction powerhouse. Cross-chain bridges will also make interoperability between Ethereum and other blockchains seamless, empowering broader adoption.  

On the sustainability front, Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake is pegged for completion by mid-2025, aiming to slash the network's energy footprint substantially. This aligns with Ethereum‚Äôs stance on staying eco-conscious while scaling up to serve global demand.  

User experience gets a hefty upgrade as the network rolls out Ethereum 2.5, bringing faster transaction finality and improved wallet interoperability. Developers also get their share of love with EVM 2.0, emerging as a powerful toolkit for building next-gen decentralized applications.  

Long-term, Buterin envisions Ethereum as the backbone of a decentralized, scalable, and sustainable ecosystem that welcomes innovative applications. At the time of writing, $ETH trades at $3,393, reflecting steady anticipation for what lies ahead.

End-to-end decentralized web hosting with MASSA's DeWeb,CryptoCurrency,1i9qjs9,2025-01-25 11:23:08,1,0.55,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i9qjs9/endtoend_decentralized_web_hosting_with_massas/,GraouMaou,TECHNOLOGY,"To change a bit from the doom and gloom of ETH holders, price speculation, presidential memecoins, and others, I wanted to write a short post about a new innovation regarding subjects central to crypto/web3: **decentralization** and **censorship resistance**. More specifically, I want to introduce you to the recent ""DeWeb"" from Massa with a short guide.

## What is Massa?

- [Massa](https://massa.net/) is a relatively new PoS L1 blockchain (mainnet launched ~1 year ago) that pioneered a parallel block processing architecture called ""blockclique"", allowing to process up to 10,000 transactions per second while maintaining decentralization. 
- As decentralization is one of the core value propositions of MASSA, running a node a staking is both easy and accessible, requiring only minimal specs (8 cores, 16 GB RAM, 1TB disk and a decent internet connection) and 100 MAS (less than 10$). Currently over 1,200 node operators are staking MASSA.
- The [Massa ecosystem](https://massa.foundation/ecosystem) is rapidly developing, already featuring a bridge from Ethereum, a [DEX](https://app.dusa.io/), NFT marketplace, memecoins, games, and more. 

Massa now pushes decentralization further by working to **decentralize the web itself**. On January 15th, they launched a platform called DeWeb, allowing to deploy fully decentralized websites.


## End-to-end decentralized websites and applications

DeWeb is a decentralized hosting solution that allows developers to build and host their websites and dApps directly on-chain, eliminating risks associated with centralized servers. Unlike centralized hosting where server failures can make sites inaccessible, DeWeb ensures site availability by replicating data across each Massa network node, eliminating single points of failure. Additionally, DeWeb-hosted sites can be made immutable, preventing unauthorized modifications or hacking attempts.

### What is the point? 

An attacker could include malicious code in an app's frontend to compromise user's wallets, promote scams, ...  A recent example is [the hack of Lego's official website](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/legos-website-hacked-to-push-cryptocurrency-scam/) to promote a fake cryptocurrency called LegoCoin. The attackers modified the homepage and inserted fraudulent links, redirecting visitors to pages promoting this crypto scam. If the site had been hosted on DeWeb, its immutable content would have prevented such fraudulent modifications and redirections.

Even in the web3/crypto world, current dApps still rely extensively on Web2 infrastructure, including dependence on centralized servers for hosting their websites. This defeats the purpose of running on a decentralized blockchain in the first place, and makes these apps vulnerable.


### Getting started with DeWeb

Multiple tools are already available to explore DeWeb and host your own websites:

- Search engine: a Google-style search bar for exploring DeWeb-hosted sites
- Massa features a [naming service](https://mns.massa.net/), providing human-readable domain names for easy access to decentralized websites.
- Easy uploader: an interface allows you to upload websites easily, by dragging-and-dropping ZIP files

## Future plans 

Looking ahead, the team announces plans to integrate with various popular CMS tools, allowing website decentralization from scratch -- another step towards true decentralization."
"I finished this year's re-watch. For RFB 1&2, I started asking GROK questions about the show. I was surprised to see its responses.",cowboybebop,1i9pvfo,2025-01-25 10:53:40,0,0.24,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/1i9pvfo/i_finished_this_years_rewatch_for_rfb_12_i/,joedapper,DISCUSSION,"What is your favorite episode?  
Choosing a favorite episode from ""Cowboy Bebop"" is tricky since the series delivers such a rich tapestry of storytelling, but if I had to pick one, I'd go with ""The Real Folk Blues Part 1"" (Episode 25):  


* Narrative: This episode serves as the beginning of the two-part finale. It brings together all the character arcs in a way that's both dramatic and emotionally resonant. It ties back to Spike's past with the Red Dragon crime syndicate, specifically his confrontation with Vicious, and it sets the stage for the series' conclusion.
* Character Development: We see deep into the characters' psyches, especially Spike's, as he grapples with his past, his love for Julia, and his existential crisis. The episode effectively brings out the themes of destiny, freedom, and the inescapable nature of one's past.
* Emotional Impact: The interactions, particularly between Spike and Jet, are poignant. The moment where Spike asks Jet to tell him that he'll see him later if he doesn't return, encapsulates the bond and the loneliness of their lives.
* Music: Yoko Kanno's score here is particularly moving, enhancing the mood and the stakes of the narrative, with tracks like ""See You Space Cowboy..."" adding to the melancholy yet hopeful atmosphere.
* Visual Style: The animation is top-notch, with the action scenes in this episode being memorable, and the art direction capturing the essence of both the Bebop's crew and the world they inhabit.

This episode encapsulates what ""Cowboy Bebop"" is about: a blend of action, deep character exploration, and an understanding of the human condition, all wrapped up in a visually and audibly stunning package. It's not just a favorite for the action or plot but for the emotional and thematic richness it brings to the series' end.

What is your favorite piece of music from the show?  
Picking a favorite piece of music from ""Cowboy Bebop"" is like choosing a favorite star in the sky, but if I have to, I'd go with ""Tank!"":  


* Opening Theme: ""Tank!"" serves as the opening theme for the series, and it's iconic for setting the mood right from the start. Composed by Yoko Kanno, with the Seatbelts, this track blends jazz with a unique, almost chaotic energy that captures the essence of the show's adventurous and unpredictable nature.
* Musical Composition: The song starts with a catchy bass line, followed by horns that give it a classic jazz feel, then it's punctuated by guitars and drums, creating a dynamic soundscape that's both cool and thrilling. The saxophone solos add a layer of soulfulness, perfectly complementing the series' mix of action and introspection.
* Cultural Impact: ""Tank!"" has become synonymous with ""Cowboy Bebop"" itself. It's not just background music; it's part of the show's identity. Its influence can be seen in how fans associate the tune with the adventures of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein, making it an anthem for the series.
* Versatility: What's remarkable about ""Tank!"" is how well it fits every episode, whether it's the light-hearted, comedic moments or the intense, action-packed scenes. It encapsulates the show's ability to blend genres and moods effortlessly.

While ""Tank!"" stands out, the beauty of ""Cowboy Bebop's"" music is in its diversity, from the melancholic ""Waltz for Zizi"" to the emotional depth of ""See You Space Cowboy..."", or the playful ""Doggy Dog World"" for Ein. Each piece contributes to the narrative and emotional layers of the series, but ""Tank!"" has that special something that resonates universally with fans.

I then told GROK - Spike isnt going, to die. Hes going to see if hes truly alive.  
  
That's a poignant interpretation, Joe. Spike's journey in ""The Real Folk Blues"" indeed transcends the question of death; it's an exploration of whether he can truly live, free from his past. Whether he finds that life or not, he's chasing that sense of being ""alive"" one last time. Enjoy the ride, and see where Spike's quest for life leads.

I then asked GROK if it understands carrying the weight:

In the context of Cowboy Bebop, particularly with the episode ""The Real Folk Blues"" (RFB) Part 1, the concept of ""carrying the weight that the fanhood places upon itself"" can be understood through several layers:  


1. Narrative Weight: Cowboy Bebop is often celebrated for its storytelling, character development, and thematic depth. Fans carry the weight of expectations for each episode, especially towards the end of the series like in RFB, where the culmination of character arcs and plot resolutions is anticipated. This weight is the expectation to see a satisfying conclusion that honors the journey of characters like Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, and Ein, while also maintaining the show's unique blend of genres and moods.
2. Character Legacy: Spike Spiegel, in particular, carries a significant narrative and emotional weight due to his past with the Red Dragon Syndicate and his unresolved issues with Vicious. Fans project their hopes and interpretations onto Spike, expecting his actions and decisions to reflect the complexity of his character. This fan expectation can be seen as a burden, where each move he makes is scrutinized for alignment with his character development over the series.
3. Cultural Impact: Cowboy Bebop has left a significant mark on anime culture, influencing countless works in and outside Japan. The fanhood carries the weight of this legacy, often feeling responsible for preserving the show's reputation while also advocating for its continued relevance. This involves debates over interpretations, fan theories, and even the handling of adaptations like the live-action Netflix series, where fans felt a protective duty towards the original material.
4. Emotional Investment: Fans invest emotionally in the narrative and characters, leading to a shared sense of loss, joy, or disappointment. This emotional weight is what fans feel when they discuss, critique, or celebrate the series, especially poignant in episodes like RFB where character fates are decided.

GROK asked me - How do you see it influencing your experience with the series, especially with such pivotal episodes?

I do feel the weight. The show has had more of an impact on me than any other work of art. RFB1 is a masterpiece of animated action and possibly Fayes finest moment as she demonstrates her ability to take out syndicate gangsters by herself. Then, it turns out shes being played by Julia. Heavy.   
  
GROK: It sounds like Cowboy Bebop has indeed left a profound mark on you, which is a testament to its storytelling and character depth. The episode ""The Real Folk Blues"" Part 1 is indeed a crescendo of narrative and emotional weight, particularly with Faye's character arc. Her moment of demonstrating her capabilities against the Syndicate is not just a showcase of her skills but also a critical point in her character development, illustrating her independence and resilience.  
However, the twist with Julia adds layers of complexity and betrayal, turning Faye's moment of triumph into one tinged with manipulation and the harsh realities of the world they inhabit. This duality in Faye's experience, from empowerment to realization, encapsulates the bittersweet essence of Cowboy Bebop - where victories are often pyrrhic, and every character carries their own burden of past and present.  
The emotional weight you feel as a fan is part of what makes Cowboy Bebop such an enduring piece of art. It evokes a spectrum of feelings, from exhilaration to melancholy, reflecting the multifaceted nature of life itself. This connection you have with the series, feeling the weight of its narrative and character journeys, is what keeps the show alive in the hearts of its fans, long after the credits roll.

What to do with $70 of ETH stuck in wallet?,CoinBase,1i9pm76,2025-01-25 10:42:19,1,0.66,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1i9pm76/what_to_do_with_70_of_eth_stuck_in_wallet/,Massive_Jello_4960,Discussion,"I‚Äôm very new to crypto, and those who are also new can take this as an example of what not to do with ETH‚Ä¶

Using Coinbase, one of the learning rewards they have is to send ETH to your wallet and buy an NFT.. receiving a $5 reward, I thought hey no worries free $5 bucks I can spend on shitcoins and not have anything to worry about‚Ä¶ boy was I wrong 

Upon completing the quest (I never got my 5 dollars) I had some leftover ETH in my wallet, In the efforts to send the ETH back to my exchange, i allowed a few dollars for gas, then I found it would need at least $44USD as a ‚Äúnetwork fee‚Äù‚Ä¶

So there I sent $70 worth of ETH to my wallet, under the assumption I would get it back (I had never seen or heard of a network fee so unbelievably high before), I thought it was some sort of minimum amount to send through the blockchain.

Now I have $75AUD of ETH in my wallet‚Ä¶
I can‚Äôt convert it, send it off, as it requires $75 USD to send, I may be extremely stupid but I‚Äôm not falling for that trick again.

If I had taken the time to research ETH I‚Äôd had known to send it through the base network, and there is no ‚Äúminimum‚Äù amount of ETH.

I feel like Coinbase should probably warn you before sending small amounts of money through the ETH network, atleast I‚Äôm not at a total loss‚Ä¶ I started with $20 and made $55..

It‚Äôs a good learning curve, although being smarter in general and doing a few hours of research could‚Äôve prevented it.

Can I buy anything with it? Do I let it sit in there till it‚Äôs worth enough that the network fee isn‚Äôt double or triple what it‚Äôs worth? I‚Äôve been attempting to do this at all different times of the week and nothings changed.

Thanks for reading have a good day üëç"

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It‚Äôs like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Congress probing crypto industry‚Äôs ‚Äòsystematic‚Äô debanking under Biden regime,Blockmandev,1i9e6lb,2025-01-24 22:38:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i9e6lb/congress_probing_crypto_industrys_systematic/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto Firms Under Fire: Congress Investigates Systemic Banking Denials  

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is turning up the heat on what many in the crypto space are calling ""systematic debanking."" The committee issued letters to major crypto entities like Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, and the Blockchain Association, demanding transparency on instances where access to banking services was denied.  

With voices like Coinbase's Brian Armstrong and Uniswap's Hayden Adams speaking out about sudden account closures, concerns are mounting that these moves could be more than just isolated incidents. The Blockchain Association claims a growing pattern under the Biden administration has limited legitimate crypto companies from conducting business, stunting innovation and forcing businesses to consider relocating.  

To counter this trend, the Blockchain Association has launched a tipline for reporting banking denials and submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to expose potentially unfair practices. Their efforts underline the industry's urgent call for clarity and equitable treatment.  

The Oversight Committee, in its probe, draws parallels with Obama-era policies like Operation Chokepoint, which scrutinized industries deemed high-risk. The ongoing investigation aims to determine whether debanking crypto firms is a matter of independent bank policies or stems from regulatory overreach.  

This comes as lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis vow to block any revival of Operation Chokepoint‚Äôs tactics. Meanwhile, the Blockchain Association stresses that the stakes involve more than crypto‚Äîit‚Äôs about the broader fight for financial autonomy and inclusion.  

Is this a watershed moment for crypto‚Äôs future in the US? Congress‚Äôs findings could very well decide whether homegrown innovation thrives or takes flight overseas.

How to stop auto-staking?,CoinBase,1i99l9r,2025-01-24 18:44:48,3,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1i99l9r/how_to_stop_autostaking/,berky2755,,"I did have some ADA and eth staked, but I've since stopped staking them.  I have the staking settings for ""Automatic earning"" unchecked, and it's been unchecked since I first started unstaking.  however, every new staking reward keeps getting re-staked automatically, despite that setting, which forces me to unstake the new rewards and rinse and repeat. at some point, given enough time, there won't be any more rewards due to the small balance, but this is extremely frustrating because it takes sooo long to unstake (especially for eth) and I don't want left with any dust that just sits there.  So, I'm sure this will not be an issue much longer, but what am I missing? is there a hidden setting? why doesn't disabling 'automatic earning' actually disable automatic earning?!?

Meaning 1 pwbtc (pulse wrapped btc costs 1.6k USD)  
will be  
1:1 with regular bitcoin ($100k USD)

saying how if you buy 1 coin of pwbtc at $1600 could be worth 100k USD this year in a matter of months (his words)

pulse chain is an exact replica of eth and if you end up getting in before the chain gets 1:1 you will have made the best play in crypto history

I wanted to know what the community thinks about this and if they have any input/info on what is going on. If what he's saying can be backed by something. Not that I doubt him. I just thought about doing my research and seeing what everyone else thinks.

The largest on-chain sports betting app now has gasless bridge with Polygon,polygonnetwork,1i94vn3,2025-01-24 15:17:43,12,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/polygonnetwork/comments/1i94vn3/the_largest_onchain_sports_betting_app_now_has/,ballsjumpman,,"[News](https://www.reddit.com/r/BASE/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%22)

Noticed that SX Bet (on-chain sports betting platform doing around $20m in monthly bets) has added a new bridging solution called Glide that offers gasless bridging between SX Network and Polygon. SX Network is SX Bet‚Äôs L2 Rollup. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet integration, essentially allows users to:

* Bridge a wide selection of different tokens on Polygon (as well as ETH, Arb, base, and OP) and receive equivalent USDC on SX Network, gas-free and no fees, instantly
* Withdraw USDC on SX Network back to Polygon instantly, to any destination address. Super low fees.

Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre a sports bettor. IMO this new integration puts their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with, if not superior to Rollbit/Stake. Especially so when you consider that it's non-custodial, so you‚Äôre able to transact and deposit or withdraw as you please without fear of funds being held.

I‚Äôve been a user of decentralized betting apps for the self-custody, transparency and better odds aspects for a while now, but the UX historically was a bit cumbersome if you‚Äôre weren't accustomed to web3. This should make it exponentially easier for anyone to use.

I saw SX Bet now has an on-ramp integration to fund your wallet with USDC on SX Network (SX Bet‚Äôs L2 Rollup) directly from your Coinbase account (through Glide). SX is the largest decentralized sports betting platform, handling around $20m/month in bets. Mainly known for its super tight lines and great odds.

If you have some USD or ETH in your Coinbase account, you can connect to it and fund your hot wallet with USDC on SX Network to start betting right away. No need to go through the tiresome process of making sure you're sending to the right address, correct token, on the correct network etc.

You can also withdraw straight to your Coinbase account on Base (with a minuscule fee, but no gas funds needed). 

Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre a sports bettor. IMO this new integration makes their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with if not superior to Rollbit/Stake.

Seeking Clarity: Coinbase Asks US Appeals Court To Declare Crypto Trades Aren‚Äôt Securities,Blockviews,1i912a0,2025-01-24 12:37:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i912a0/seeking_clarity_coinbase_asks_us_appeals_court_to/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Coinbase Calls for Clarity on Digital Asset Trades  

Coinbase has taken a pivotal step, filing an appeal to the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals to bring much-needed clarity to the legal status of crypto trades. The exchange argues that secondary trades of digital assets fall outside the SEC's jurisdiction, positioning them as ""asset sales"" rather than securities transactions. This bold move aims to set clear boundaries for a rapidly growing multi-trillion-dollar industry that millions of Americans partake in daily.  

The debate centers on whether digital assets align with the Howey Test‚Äîthe SEC's traditional framework for defining securities‚Äîor operate as standalone asset sales without ongoing obligations between buyers and issuers, much like purchasing a physical item. Coinbase strongly believes the latter and sees this case as a prime opportunity to establish regulatory consistency.  

This legal showdown comes after Judge Katherine Failla granted an interlocutory appeal earlier this month, emphasizing the need for clarity amidst conflicting rulings in past cases like Ripple and Terraform Labs. Meanwhile, the SEC, under its new leadership, has hinted at making digital asset regulation a top priority, including the possible launch of a Digital Assets Task Force.  

With billions of dollars and the industry's future at stake, this case could pave the way for a clearer regulatory landscape. Will Coinbase‚Äôs fight spark a much-needed reform for crypto, or will the SEC hold its ground? Stay tuned as this crucial case unfolds.

I sent over 1 ETH to my Metamask wallet from coinbase and I am not seeing it. Is it possible it got stolen? 

  
Block Explorer on Coinbase shows that it went through to my MM wallet address.  
However when I go to my Metamask, it does not show I received the 1 ETH. The etherscan shows a different wallet, and then when I click that wallet, it shows they have over 776 ETH !! 

  
Can someone help, did I get robbed? If so how? I would love clarity on this. I do not get it at all.

  
Here is the Etherscan: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaec4c3a4c57bd3b1f3f362c4f27183546d6f6311a6dba2dd9196b19d55b1539f](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaec4c3a4c57bd3b1f3f362c4f27183546d6f6311a6dba2dd9196b19d55b1539f)

What do you think of a SPL token that generates yield on ETH as ERC-20 Pepe?

Imagine this narrative : Pepe‚Äôs dad starts his journey on Solana. He‚Äôs lost, wandering the blockchain wilderness, desperately trying to find his way back to his son, Pepe, who‚Äôs chilling over on Ethereum.

But here‚Äôs the catch: Abu Pepe (Pepe‚Äôs dad‚Äî‚ÄúAbu‚Äù means father in Arabic) can‚Äôt just hop chains casually. He needs to stake himself on Solana first. Once he does that, bam~he magically appears on Ethereum. But his journey isn‚Äôt over yet. To reunite with Pepe, Abu Pepe must stake himself again, this time on Ethereum, and through the mystical staking powers, he can finally summon his beloved son Pepe.

I am designing this to spread DeFi via meme magic.

*Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative offices*

Undersecretary Ah'nuriel was having a very odd day. Of course, odd days were becoming almost normal of late. Her husband had sent her a long message detailing how much he missed her scent. She'd gotten fairly good at guessing what wasn't being said over the past few years. Messages with hidden meaning were only meaningful if you knew how to read them. And what was being said was difficult - most of their contracted work was going to the Sword of the Light Gods, however the Terrans were beginning to hire companies of their own accord. That was the reason for the meeting today. A Terran who appeared to be wearing subtle joint braces underneath a very oddly fashioned suit - it covered the entirety of his body, with a few cloth decorations. The entire thing was black save for a white shirt. His sunglasses were unusual, and not just because he only had two eyes. They were square and very dark, making his entire hatchet-looking furless face somehow more off-putting. Old instincts were warning her that this Terran brought danger to her door.

The undersecretary took a breath, remembering that somehow this species was a formidable one ‚Äì and one of her tasks was to find out why. Still, the Terran was polite enough and allowed himself to be sniffed first. His scent was cloying, and almost resembled a Minister's in some ways ‚Äì there was an honest deception to him, as if he expected things to be withheld.

She took a breath, considering her first move. ""So how can the Trade Cooperative assist you today...""

The man smiled easily. ""Smith will suffice. Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. We'd like to investigate an opportunity for trade. If you're not familiar with us, our business is risk assessment at the core. We assess risk and set a price on assuming a worst-case scenario for that risk. In dangerous times we may refuse to do business in an area entirely. But now with the peace accords, the risk is substantially lower. We'd like some assistance from the Trade Cooperative.""

And there was the deception wrapped in a smooth voice. Or at least the first one. Their business wasn't entirely risk assessment, but something else. The undersecretary kept her fur low with an effort. ""Well, our business is the trade of goods, so there may be areas of overlap. But I'm not certain what more we could commit to without specifics.""

""Well, multiple Terran companies have expressed interest in forming permanent partnerships here and paying well for their partnership. Worlds like yours and Hurdop Prime are rare ‚Äì high gravity, atmosphere conducive to our life forms, and land that's good for many crops. Not Terran, of course; your gravity would kill most of our plant life. But, as a manufacturing center, many things that you can make here are far more expensive to make on other worlds. In addition, there are Terrans who would come here to train physically - athletes training their muscles in higher gravity would make exceptional leaps over those that don't. In return, economic prosperity and perhaps unique items of our own that can withstand this environment. We'd like assurances that this peace is a binding one, and that honoring our contracts won't leave us at a loss.""

Ah'nuriel cocked her head slightly. ""Perhaps that is a question better answered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.""

""Come now, Undersecretary. A meeting with the Foreign Affairs department would leave me with bland reassurance no matter the truth in addition to my already aching knees. I seek the honesty that only comes from a balance sheet. In addition, I understand that you have something of a personal stake in continued peace.""

Her fur flared almost of its own volition. ""That information is...accurate. But not quite relevant.""

""On this, we must agree to disagree - risk assessment requires accurate information, and a great deal of detail. With that said, here is some information that I have from Terran companies."" Agent Smith slid a small datapad over. ""Those are the companies willing to invest, and the amounts they are willing to pay at this time. They are substantial, and with assurances of security could grow. Which would mean the amounts they pay us would grow, and everyone goes home happy. Of course I would ensure my superiors knew your name in my reports. So, information for information. There's no reason to say yes or no right now - my superiors are arranging a conference at our offices in New Casablanca in a few months, and we are making an attendee list right now. Purely speculative for the moment, but I'm sure if I polled your co-workers right now there would be several interested parties. With the right voices in the right ears, a great deal can change. A captain could have a name, for example.""

Ah'nuriel nodded reluctant agreement. ""Information for information, then.""

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk's life had never been so busy. There had been a few days of respite as his ship and crew had celebrated and enjoyed a fine night at Sparrows, and then began the process of correcting and implementing new things that their victory had allowed the company to purchase. Inertial dampeners, a secondary shielding system, some additional systems for weapons, new paint, and what may have been most important, a new coffee maker for Engineering. For himself and the bridge team, however, it meant exceptionally long days in a command simulator, where they'd been run through multiple engagements and tactical sequences. After each engagement, the proctors from the 7th would go over everyone's errors in excruciating detail. The proctors were dark magicians at finding errors - even when they'd run through simulated exercises perfectly, there was still a detail that had been overlooked, a way it could have been done better. He'd lost the entire ship on several occasions, which unnerved him as the proctors went over every failing he'd had during those engagements. It was disheartening until O'Brien had finally told the proctors to give them the room. In the conference room over tea, coffee, and foul language they finally were able to gain a sense of what was happening; each simulation was meant to test a specific aspect of their skills, and in the portions they were looking at, Gryzzk and the rest of the crew had performed admirably. Within the rest of it was dressing for them to find mistakes and play headgames - O'Brien pointed out two specific instances where Gryzzk had done something, been called out for it, and then did as they suggested and still merited a chewing out. Things seemed to go better somehow after that, with them acting and reacting to things with a bit less tension.

All of that meant precious little time with his wife and children. He'd had a chance to watch the news a bit more, and it seemed as if every day there was something new that made him feel as if his company was falling behind on a tally sheet that existed only in his mind. Even the Swords of the Light Gods had taken on a successful job ‚Äì a passenger escort run between New Casablanca and Vilantia. It nagged at him until after three weeks he sent a terse voice message to the Major advising that he was going to stand the company down for a week to assess their next steps prior to their next job.

The reply message was a soft chuckle and a ""Your company, your rules.""

His delivery of the news at the morning briefing was met with relief and cheers from the crew. As much as they would have kept going for a few more weeks if he'd asked, Gryzzk had observed the Terrans seemed to believe that making time for family and new friends was important ‚Äì perhaps that was one of their secrets.

They finished up the day's work and Gryzzk found himself on the couch at the end of the day as the children all took spots, with Nhoot staying close to Gryzzk and Gro'zel staying closer to her mother, while the twins took their place in the middle of all of them. Gryzzk frowned a bit as the mercenary news of the day was a re-enactment of the Sword's second engagement - a battle against a Throne's Fortune base which left Gryzzk talking to the wallscreen - only to have his opinions confirmed by the commentators. The Swords seemed to be taking every opportunity to simply overwhelm with force and then destroy even when it would have been more profitable to disable and take the ships whole; particularly since the Hurdop government had formally disavowed the Throne's Fortune as a renegade element and confirmed that there would be a bounty paid for proof in the form of letters of marque.

One of commentators was blunt. ""It's like they're a bully who got beaten and tries to prove they aren't weak by picking on the ones they know don't have a shot. If this is an advert for their skills, I dunno who's buying...""

The one bonus of the arrival of the Swords was that more Vilantian shows were available; the family sat and watched a few classic comedy shows and smiled appropriately, but something seemed off about them. Perhaps it was the time, but the jokes didn't make either of them laugh like they used to.

Still, they went to bed and the next day they took one of the shuttles to New Casablanca. Not the bar district, but the more family-friendly shopping district, filled with temporary stalls dotting the more permanent structures where a dazzling array of goods from Terra could be purchased. While Gryzzk only kept his rank tab on himself for emergency communications, the girls had refused to leave until their purple berets were on their head with their rank proudly placed. Grezzk took the lead, finding a small area of shops that had started to stock items from the Vilantian homeworld. Grezzk took the opportunity to pay a shameful price for some foodstuffs and a few small items that reminded them of home.

Once outside, several Vilantians were waiting, their scent an undisguised disgust. They wore the gold and black uniforms of the Swords company with ranks that designated them as senior staff ‚Äì all in all this did not bode well.

""Nameless captain, step forth. We do not wish to harm you. We bear a message from the Minister of War.""

Gryzzk closed one pair of his eyes for a moment. ""I recall Commodore A'Drapir's message quite well, friends - may the dead gods treat him well.""

""I do not recall Commodore A'Drapir being named Minister of War. The Minister himself has an offer. He sees that you have become something unexpected; and with that he offers his voice in Restoration and a role within the Swords of the Light Gods. Your own ship, your own crew consisting of the finest Vilantians from Clan Aa'Porti. Picked soldiers to do your bidding ‚Äì if you do his bidding. The Clan Way calls to you. Your Great Lord calls to you. The Minister would have your voice in the future of Vilantia. Answer yes with your full voice, and all this-"" there was a vague gesture to their surroundings ""-can be a forgotten memory.""

There was a pause ""What future would that be?""

""A future where the Clan Way is made truth and the worlds of this sector are held to it.""

Gryzzk closed his remaining eyes, knowing that what he was going to say would probably condemn him in the eyes of at least three Ministers. ""Not long ago, the Clan Way was the only way I knew. But there is a better way. Clans built not by a birth more than thirty generations past, but choice. My clan is young, built on those the Clan Way would have us cast aside, ignore, and condemn. If we win victory, we learn. If we are defeated, we do not pretend it didn't happen. This offer would have suited me once. But it does not suit me now. When I walk from the twilight, it will be on my own feet with a clan of Vilantians, Hurdop, and Terrans at my side.""

The disgust and fury in their scent made the girls recoil behind Grezzk, and finally one of them spat at the ground. ""None who dwell in the twilight may pass judgment on those in the light. Minister Aa'tebul will lend his voice to more worthy causes. We will not fight this day."" So saying, they spun and walked away with precision.

Grezzk swallowed, and both Gro'zel and Nhoot came out from behind Grezzk. Grezzk had a slight smirk on her face.

""Lord A'Gryzzk, we must make another child soon."" She leaned into him warmly for a moment before they began walking to the shuttle with their purchases.

""I'm no lord. I just do what's best for my family and those under my command.""

""And those under your command would call you a Lord.""

""You realize that would make you a Lady, correct?""

""It would ‚Äì but only because you shine so brightly.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't like it. A Lord is born a Lord, and I was not born such."" Still, there was anxiety. He'd effectively become a lord by the acclaim of those he commanded, and even prior to that with managing Lord A'kifab's household. But to become a lord seemed almost insulting in some way.

There was a bit of consideration and silence before Gryzzk caught a familiar scent and turned to call out. ""Edwards?""

Edwards stepped from around a market stall ‚Äì she was wearing a set of hooded grey robes that covered her almost head to toe. She looked a bit embarrassed, but smiled. ""Gonna have to wear perfume next time. Ugh.""

""Why?""

""Hiding my scent, obviously."" She shrugged. ""So what'd those bumblebees want?""

""They wanted me to come work for them.""

Edwards blinked. ""Oh. You, ah, thinkin' about it?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No. I have a clan already, as you recall.""

Edwards seemed relieved. ""Okay, cool. Yeah, that must have been hard.""

""Not as much as I thought it would. I have something meaningful here, and we have agreed to things. Together. They did not wish to include anyone else. But we have a conundrum of sorts."" Gryzzk paused to consider how to couch the question. ""Titles are important to us. Lead Servant, Lord, Greatlord, things like that. Does Terran or Hurdop culture have a title that fits this situation that we're in?""

Edwards chuffed softly. ""Whatcha mean?""

""Well essentially a commoner in what is traditionally a noble position.""

""Oh yeah, your captains are...but not really for the Hurdop...sorta."" Edwards' eyes unfocused as she seemed to be reading a tablet from her memory and she started thinking out loud. ""But...Samoan - Matai, no. Feudal Japan - Jizamurai, maybe but we'll keep going...Nordic - Jarl - nah too close to earl and they'd call me out for playing too much Skyrim again..."" Finally she snapped back to reality. ""I'll have to think about it. I'll talk to Engineering but we might just need to invent a new word for you, Cap.""

""Indeed. If it comes to that let me know. Now, to the other question I have ‚Äì why were you following me?""

Edwards looked like a child about to get disciplined for marking the walls. ""Well, respectfully Cap, you've made some enemies. Bad Moon's put money on the board for an asskicking with you as the recipient, and few of the Swords were making noises about bringing you into the light according to Reilly.""

""How does Reilly know?""

""She bought 'em a couple drinks. Apparently we all look alike to you.""

""Remind me to compensate her.""

""She said she'll trade the drinks for a refresh on her roots from Mama Grezzk."" Edwards smirked a little.

Grezzk seemed taken aback slightly. ""Mama?""

There was a nod. ""Mmm-hm. On the ship Nhoot calls him Captain Papa, so Mama just kinda grew out of that.""

Grezzk's fur flickered. ""I. I hadn't considered that. Of course, we'll be here whenever she wishes."" She paused for a moment. ""Let her know that tonight we're having a garlic chicken recipe for dinner.""

They shuttled back to the company area and split off; Edwards heading to her room in the barracks and Gryzzk leading his family to their quarters. Gryzzk settled in on the couch with the boys and checked his tablet while the girls ran to their room to play with their new toys. Grezzk began marinating the chicken and preparing the rice before settling in on the couch.

""You don't like the idea of being a Lord, do you?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""It feels wrong, somehow.""

She leaned into him gently. ""Whatever they call you, you will always be my handsome hand.""

For a long moment, there was a bubble of peace as the universe shrank to a small officer's quarters with girls playing and giggling, two boys cradled between their parents, and the parents enjoying the opportunity to stare at a hologram of a Vilantian sunset.

The silence couldn't last forever, and there was a chime at the door. It was Reilly, grinning happily with a small case filled with hair colors. Gryzzk put the boys in their beds as Grezzk lowered the gravity to match the ship standard before opening the door. Reilly came in and was promptly greeted by Nhoot and Gro'zel who simply had to show off their new toys. There was some general laughter and amusement as Reilly nuzzled Grezzk's neck briefly and then sneezed.

Reilly was bouncing a little bit and seemed to almost be everywhere at once, dipping a finger in the marinade and pronouncing it to be 'zippy', and then looking at the twins and ooh'ing and sniffing them delicately so as not to wake them. After that she was teaching the girls to dance. Oddly. Finally she flopped on the couch and tapped on Gryzzk's tablet.

""You didn't read the message I sent, Cap?""

Gryzzk quirked at her. ""I didn't yet.""

""Stuff's happening. Got a lead on a new job outta Hurdop Prime, and the news is going to be interesting tonight.""

The new information was accepted casually, and Gryzzk took his tablet back for more information on the job. It appeared to be a specific request from a new Hurdop trading company called the Great Triangle of Hurdop. The job itself seemed simple; escorting a pair of ships from Hurdop Prime to Terra Prime, then to Vilantia prime, and finally a return to Hurdop Prime. It seemed simple enough, but at the same time it was concerning. He looked at the pay for the job before forwarding it to Rosie with an inquiry if they could add about five percent more and stipulate payment for hazards and combat.

Rosie agreed, and they sent an amended version of the request back to the Great Triangle.

Dinner was a raucous affair, as Reilly told jokes and stories about how Gryzzk was aboard the ship. Finally as they cleaned up, the twins began to stir for their food, and Reilly was polite enough to wait that out while they watched the news. The mercenary-focused section was as interesting as Reilly had promised.

""...and in new stand-ups, we've got a few. Bad Moon Company has announced the formation of a new associate company, the Foreign Legion of Terra. This comes on the heels of Swissguards press release regarding their own Terran Legion of Foreigners and - oooh, here's a little outside the box thinking - Polar Bear Company's rolling out the Foreign Terran Legion. Funnily enough, they're all rocking shades of purple for their colors. Great marketing teams out there."" The announcer shook his head and turn to his co-anchor for more commentary while Reilly began laughing so hard tears were forming.

""Oh. My God."" Reilly wheezed. ""This is awesome.""

""I'm not sure I understand."" Gryzzk tried to focus on the commentators, who seemed pessimistic - they agreed that the 7th Cavalry had caught some manner of lightning in a bottle with the 'OG Terran Foreign Legion', but whether that success could be replicated was an entirely different manner.

Reilly giggled a little bit more before gathering herself and quoting from a movie that Gryzzk vaguely remembered. ""It's like that thing - 'Are you the Judean People's Front?' 'Fuck off! Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea!' It's hilarious, we're so good we've already got knockoffs.""

Grezzk finally got the twins resettled and changed for bed, and came out to get Reilly's hair color refreshed properly. It was an odd thing to watch, as Grezzk and Reilly chatted amiably about things - Reilly was enthralled by certain aspects of Vilantia, and made casual allusions to shore leave and possibly even vacationing there when the chance came. Finally with her hair color re-purpled and ends re-done, Reilly took her leave.

""I do believe we're going to have to ask your bosses to look at the applications you forwarded sooner rather than later."" Grezzk smiled softly.

""Mmm. Probably. We'll need to avoid damage on this next job.""

""Worry about that on the next job. I would have my handsome hand warm our bed tonight.""

Gryzzk smiled a bit himself as he led his wife to a good night's sleep."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Memory Transcript Subject: Cenci, The Great Explorer of the Forest**

To say I was surprised by the predator‚Äôs home would be an understatement. 

The place was far too vibrant for what I‚Äôd expected. 

The metal walls were lined with paintings framed, each one meticulously placed. 

It wasn‚Äôt just the paintings, either‚Äîpart of the wall was covered in picture frames, and there were even string instruments hanging in a neat arrangement.

The sheer size of the room caught me off guard too. 

For a spaceship, where every inch of space is usually crammed for efficiency‚Äîunless it‚Äôs a cruise ship‚Äîthis was big. 

And the decorations? 

Nearly all wood furniture, polished and sturdy, giving the room a warmth that felt almost... homely.

So this is the captain‚Äôs room. 

Opulent, but with a surprisingly modest touch. It wasn‚Äôt over-the-top‚Äîno statues or gaudy displays to scream wealth or power. 

Just enough to make it impressive without tipping into excess.

And I‚Äôm not the only one surprised by how un-‚Äúpredator‚Äù this room is. 

Kalip‚Äôs face is just as shocked, probably thinking the same thing I am‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt how a predator would decorate their space. 

Where are the bloodstains? 

The bones? 

The cages?

I don‚Äôt see a single thing here that matches what the school taught us about predators.

Before I could take in more of the room, the human cleared her throat loudly and gestured toward a big large red couch positioned behind a wide wood low table looking toward a blank wall. 

She stood beside it, her hand briefly brushing the surface as if to draw our attention. 

Unlike most of the wooden furniture around, the couch seemed fused to the metal floor, its sleek material standing out sharply against the rest of the room's rustic aesthetic.

I also noticed an interesting vase on the low table‚Äîwhite, with red patterns swirling across it. 

It looked like a tree, but I couldn‚Äôt be sure. 

I shrugged and turned my attention back to the human.

""Put him there,"" she said, and I complied.

As I set him down on the couch, he practically sank into it with a grunt, flicking his ear in what I assumed was thanks. 

Curiosity got the better of me, and I pressed my hand against the red cushion. 

The softness was almost criminal‚Äîit felt like it could swallow me whole. 

For a moment, the temptation to collapse into it tugged at me as my body wanted to just rest. 

Almost. 

But I shoved the thought aside. 

There were still things to explore and discover, if the human lets me roam her home.

I looked at the human, who simply smiled at me as I behind the couch I inspected. 

Her gaze made me shuffle uncomfortably, heat prickling under my fur in embarrassment.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs soft,‚Äù she said, her tone casual. 

‚ÄúI paid a lot of money for high-quality material‚Äîfor my cyborg ass, you know. But before we rest or sleep, do you want any food?‚Äù

The question made both me and my big brother bristle, our spines stiffening at the revolting thought of what she might consider edible. 

I could already feel my stomach turning at the idea of consuming predator food.

I saw her roll her eyes.

""From the look on your faces, and the fact that you keep calling me a predator, I‚Äôm guessing you guys don‚Äôt eat meat?""

The word meat didn‚Äôt bother me as much, but Kalip‚Äôs reaction was something else. He practically shivered, his whole body stiffening like she‚Äôd just threatened him.

""Oh, don't be like that,"" she muttered, frustration in her voice as she scowled at the wall, probably imagining the meat she wished she could have. ""I‚Äôve been eating food cubes made of plants for months before I was frozen.""

""Anyway,"" she continued, turning back to face me, making me flinch a bit, ""I can guarantee‚Äîone hundred percent, mind you‚Äîthat they're entirely plant-based. Trust me, I checked to make sure Six wasn't hiding any meat from me."" She finished with a grumble, her annoyance clear.

Huh so humans can eat greens not just red.

 The files online did say something about them to be able to eat both meat and plants if I remember correctly

Just didn't expect to hear it from the humans own mouth filled fangs to say it.

My history teachers didn't really talk about the human to also eat greens or actually they didn't talk much about humans at all they just made a passing mention to them being the second predator species. 

All focusing on the Arxurs.

The human started walking towards somewhere I hesitated but followed wonder what this plant base food she could be eating.

I heard big brother make a noise but he just sinks into the couch but still warily looking over the human and me.

I followed the human into what I assumed was the kitchen on the right side of the suite. The strange appliances scattered across the counters hinted at its purpose, but if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the massive square fridge standing in the corner made it unmistakable.

I could barely get my head over the counter it is like a wall‚Äîcurse my tiny Gojid legs. All the height must‚Äôve gone to Kalip's genes, no wonder he is as tall as a human.

Leaning up, I peeked over just in time to see her open the fridge, glance inside, then close it with a frown before walking across the kitchen.

Was there no food? Aw, I was starting to feel a bit hungry. Maybe those food cubes have a mushroom flavor?

I mean they might contain meat but I trust the human because she hasn't broken my trust yet.

The human bent down, her back the only thing visible as she reached for something below the counter, rummaging out of sight. A moment later, she straightened, placing what looked like a block of brick onto the counter.

Interesting how easily they can do that. If I need to reach that low, I have to kneel or drop to all fours. It‚Äôs not unique, of course‚Äîthe Venlil, Kolshian, Zurulians, and even the Krakotl with their single-digit winged claws manage it too. But the way she moves‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the word? Ah, elegant, I think.

There‚Äôs a smoothness, an efficiency in how her body moves‚Äîno energy wasted, even when the action itself seems wasteful. It‚Äôs like her body knows how to work perfectly, but the pilot running it... not so much.

Wait‚Äîdid she just glance at me? Can humans read thoughts?

I caught the human‚Äôs eyes glaring at me from across the kitchen, just above the counter. My body flinched before my brain even caught up, and I ducked behind the counter to hide.

I could hear her laughter from the other side of the room, a light chuckle that never quite stopped.

OK, that scared me a bit. Calm down, deep breath. 

Those piercing predator blue eyes are unnerving. 

I inhaled slowly, rising to my feet‚Äîonly to see the human looming on the white counter, smiling down at me. 

I yelped and fell backward.

The human howled in laughter.

Ouch, my butt. WHY IS SHE ON THE COUNTER?! Wait a minute‚Äîwhy didn‚Äôt I hear her move? She was chuckling. 

Oh, right. 

I forgot‚Äîshe can walk silently like that.

Suddenly, her hand shot up to where she was squatting, snatching the white vase by its neck. Her laughter dropped to a chuckle.

I glanced at where the vase had come from and suprise when I saw Kalip, arm still outstretched like he'd just thrown a log, standing behind the couch.

""I don't know what your plan is, predator, but stop harassing my little sister and scaring her! And stop laughing like a tclintan big maw predator, or I‚Äôll throw another pottery! I‚Äôm trying to rest here!"" Kalip shouted.

The human shrugged. ""Sure, crippled spike boy,"" she teased, jumping off the counter and dusting herself off.

Big brother huffed at the name but flopped onto the couch, shifting around as if trying to find a comfortable spot. 

His eyes, however, never left the human.

She approached, carrying what looked like bricks wrapped in plastic in one arm and the white vase in the other.

""Sorry about that, kid. Scaring you and all,"" she said, her tone unexpectedly polite and laced with sincerity. 

It threw me off for a moment‚Äîthis was a surprising shift from the curt demeanor she‚Äôd shown earlier.

It caught me off guard, but I didn‚Äôt show it. I just grumbled, still nursing my sore butt and calming my bristled spikes.

""Come on, bet you're hungry,"" she said, striding toward the couch. 

I followed her as she set the vase Kalip had thrown back in its place, as if it had never been threw at her.

Beside it she dropped the packs of bricks with a thud as the wrappers spill onto the wooden low table, making Kalip glares at her, daring the human to make any more noise.

Whether she was aware or not, the human dragged the low table closer to the couch, the grinding sound of wood scraping against metal filling the air. Kalip frowned but didn‚Äôt say anything. I could almost hear his teeth grinding from the noise.

After all that, with the table now pulled closer to the couch, she finally picked up one of the bland-looking brown plastic-wrapped packages. 

She glanced at the name stamped on the plastic briefly before tearing it open with ease. Inside was a block of what I could only assume were compressed brown nutrients.

Ah, so these are the food cubes she was talking about. 

Though, to be honest, they look more like food rectangles than cubes.

She bit into the brick-shaped food, chewing thoughtfully before nodding. 

Then she sat on the far end of the couch, carefully out of Kalip‚Äôs reach.

""Hey, khids, cohme scit bet you're hungry,"" she said, still chewing loudly and tapping a spot on the couch between her and Kalip.

Somehow, my translator managed to make sense of her muffled words.

I just sighed. 

I didn‚Äôt trust that the brick she was eating was meat-free. 

Suddenly, my stomach growled... loudly. 

Too loudly. 

Both the human and Kalip turned to look at me.

I lowered my head, heat rising in my cheeks, and quickly stomped over to the large couch.

Sitting beside the human, I sank into the plush cushions, nearly swallowed by the couch‚Äôs soft embrace. 

Bliss threatened to creep onto my face, but I forced myself to keep it neutral as embarrassment filled my body.

The human laughed at my obvious embarrassment, and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to meet Kalip‚Äôs eyes. 

Why did my stomach have to betray me like that? 

I know I‚Äôm hungry, but not that hungry!

The human‚Äôs laughter finally died down, though she was still chewing on that food brick. 

Honestly, I was a bit surprised she hadn‚Äôt choked on it yet. 

A small, mean part of me wished she had‚Äîat least it would‚Äôve ended her laughter faster and spared me from more embarrassment.

I watched as she reached for the low table, grabbing another brick of what looked like nutrients of dubious origin. 

She held it out to me, her expression almost casual, as if this was completely normal.

I raised a paw in front of me, shaking my head quickly. ‚ÄúUh, no thanks, Miss Aurora,‚Äù I said, my voice wavering just enough to betray the nervousness I tried to hide.

The human frowned, pausing mid-bite on the brick. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be like that, kid. I know you‚Äôre hungry‚Äîyour stomach told me so,‚Äù she said, snickering at the end.

I blushed lightly. 

Yes, lightly. 

My face definitely didn‚Äôt just turn into molten magma for a second there.

‚ÄúAnd your brother probably needs a treat too, especially after getting himself injured through his own decisions and stupidity.‚Äù

That earned a grunt from the big Gojid, his one open eye glaring daggers at the human. 

She, of course, didn‚Äôt seem to care in the slightest.

She waved the food cube in the air. ""And besides, I‚Äôll say this again‚Äîthis is a plant-based one. And this,"" she took a moment to read the wrapper, ""grain-based one is made of... Sticibal water grain mixed with... other vegetables. So, not a single meat or animal product in this food cube, I guarantee you. As the Marshal CEO of the Auroran Mercenary Corporation, I stake my reputation!"" She said this proudly.

I tilted my head at what she said. ""Marshal CEO?"" My translator worked its magic and gave me the meaning of ""Marshal,"" but that only left me more confused. I kind of knew that corporations made weapons and spaceships to fight the Arxur, but they were just called CEOs, not some combat-oriented title. 

Is this what humans consider normal?

I heard Kalip behind me laugh harshly. ""What reputation? For all we know, you are just a human who crashed your ship on Cradle, and it's only a bit more advanced in technology than the humans on the planet you call Earth,"" Kalip said.

The human huffed at the insult but suddenly stilled for some reason before shaking her head. ""We will get back the nuke you just dropped,"" she said.

I looked toward Kalip, who had a confused look on his face.

""Anyway, just try it, kid, and you, spike boy. If it has meat, you can just spit it out and starve. Simple.""

I gave her a look, and she smiled back at me. 

I nearly gagged at the thought of eating meat but also felt a creeping horror at the possibility of starving.

The problem was, my stomach had other plans. 

Its loud growl left no room for debate. 

With a sigh of resignation, I took the plastic-wrapped food from the human‚Äôs hand and inspected it. 

My translator worked overtime trying to make sense of the human language stamped on the wrapper. Strange, heated letters formed words on the plastic.

Huh, weird. 

Why is my translator struggling with this? 

It took a moment, but eventually, it managed to make the label readable. 

The human wasn‚Äôt lying‚Äîat least, if the packaging could be trusted. 
No mention of meat anywhere. 

My eyes lingered on the calorie count: 650 kals, it read. 

Hmm. 

A bit less than the a single standard meal Auntie insists on shoving down our stomachs.

Before I could even tear the wrapper open, I heard Kalip shift on the couch.

""Stop. Give that to me, Cenci,"" he said suddenly, startling me. 

I blinked at him, but quickly shook it off and turned my focus to look at him. 

He had moved closer, his expression firm.

""Huh? Why?"" I asked, confusion evident in my voice.

""Because I can't let my little sister eat meat if it contains any,"" he said firmly, his tone brooking no argument. ""Our parents, may the Great Mother bless them, would throw me off a cliff."" His eyes locked on the human, a sharp glare aimed her way. 

She didn‚Äôt seem fazed, though‚Äîjust sat there smiling, chewing leisurely on her food cube as if none of this concerned her.

I sighed, the weight of his brotherly protectiveness pressing down on me, and handed him the wrapper without another word. 

He‚Äôs an exterminator, after all. 

He‚Äôs probably seen what animal meat looks and smells like. 

Especially with the stories I‚Äôve heard from his colleagues in his division‚Äîabout how often he‚Äôs gone paw-to-claw fighting predators.

He looked at it for a moment before tearing the wrapper open. 

His eyes scanned the brown brick of a food cube, and my curiosity got the better of me. 

I leaned in just enough to catch a whiff of it.

Surprisingly, it didn‚Äôt smell how I imagined. 

It had the faint, stale scent of strayu, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure.

Kalip took a quick sniff, his expression unreadable. 

No gagging, no disgust‚Äîjust a blank stare.

Then, with a bit of force, he broke off a piece of the cube, crumbs scattering all over his lap. It startled both of us.

Huh. I mean, I know food cubes are supposed to be dense, but after seeing the human casually bite into hers, I expected it to be... softer.

""You predators and your jaws,"" Kalip said, exasperated, shaking his head.

The human swallowed her mouthful, the action making me feel a little uneasy as my mind unhelpfully wandered to the thought of her eating meat.

""Oh, don‚Äôt worry. A human jaw would break, and teeth would crack if anyone tried biting into one of these bricks. It‚Äôs just me‚ÄîI‚Äôm a borg,"" she said, tapping her jaw as if it were a solid slab of metal. The sound of tapping against her cheek was surprisingly ordinary‚Äîno metallic clang or anything like that.

Huh. So... is she saying she‚Äôs made of metal and electronics? 

She did mention back in the chamber that she‚Äôs a cyborg. 

She and my translator did defines that as some mix of robot and human. 

So, does that mean she‚Äôs just a human with metal bones or something?

Kalip scoffed at the human, hesitating only briefly before cautiously licking the chunk he had broken off. 

After a moment, he closed his eyes and placed the entire piece in his mouth. 

I instinctively shifted away, not wanting to be in the line of fire if he spat or worse‚Äîvomited.

Unfortunately, this brought me uncomfortably closer to the human, who still held the possibility of having slipped meat into her so-called plant-based meal.

I held my breath, waiting for everything to go wrong. 

But to my surprise‚Äîand relief‚Äînothing happened. 

Kalip chewed methodically, his expression softening slightly before he leaned back against the couch. 

Finally, he stretched his arm out toward me, holding the food cube.

""Fortunately, the predator is telling the truth, Cenci. It doesn‚Äôt contain any meat,"" he said, his tone tinged with reluctance and a hint of surprise.

I exhaled deeply, the tension in my chest easing. 

So, it really doesn‚Äôt contain any meat. 

Thank the Great Mother the human wasn‚Äôt lying.

I took the opened food cube without a word but a thanks with a flick of an ear.

Knowing how hard the food cube was, I used my claw to carefully slice off a piece. 

As I chewed, the dense texture softened and seemed to melt in my mouth. 

The taste matched the smell‚Äîstrayu, but with something else woven into it. 

A hint of‚Ä¶ something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. 

It wasn‚Äôt bad, per se, just different, unusual compared to the standard.

There was a faint saltiness, but it leaned more toward sweetness, like it had sugar in it. Do humans like sugar as much as we prefer saltier flavors? 

I wondered, rolling the taste around in my mouth before swallowing.

The human burst into loud laughter, causing me to pin my ears flat against my head. ""Told ya, spike balls! I‚Äôm not some scumbag. I‚Äôm a respectable leader of the Auroran Mercenary Corporation! I cannot have my name sullied by misinformation. Trust is the most important word in my corp!"" she declared, her voice brimming with pride.

Kalip, still chewing on his chunk of the meal, rolled his eyes at the human.

She grabbed two more wrappers from the pile on the table, casually tossing one in an arc toward Kalip.

He caught it with an open paw, his grip firm, and sent a sharp glare in her direction.

Then, without warning, the human sprang to her feet, her movements quick and almost unsettling in their energy. 

She stretched her arms overhead, her posture loose but purposeful, as though shaking off invisible tension. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you two to your own things,‚Äù she said casually, her tone breezy yet firm.

‚ÄúGonna find some water for you both and check if my babies have any rust on them. Just don‚Äôt go into the rooms‚ÄîI‚Äôll know.‚Äù

Her words hung in the air, light but carrying an edge of warning, as she strode off without waiting for a response.

Before I could process her words, she turned and left, already tearing open another food cube wrapper as she disappeared from view.

Which surprised both of us. 

Did a predator really just leave us alone in her own home? 

I mean, we‚Äôre not exactly a threat to her‚Äîthat much she had made clear‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not how a predator is supposed to act.

We exchanged glances, silently acknowledging how strange the human was, before turning our focus back to the meal. 

The room was quiet, the only sounds coming from the faint crinkle of wrappers and the subtle flick of our ears as we passed messages back and forth. 

Are you okay? I asked silently. 

His reply came just as subtly, I‚Äôm fine. Don‚Äôt worry about me. 

But I couldn‚Äôt help wondering if his injuries would leave something permanent.

Neither of us had the energy to speak much after everything that had happened today.

Kalip‚Äôs eyes were half-closed, scanning the room as though searching for something unseen, while I let my gaze wander over the decorated metal walls. 

The pictures and artwork caught my attention‚Äîmostly digital or abstract pieces. 

The kind where you just splash colors around to paint your feelings. 

I never really liked those. 

Landscapes are more my thing, the ones that feel alive, like you could step right into them.

I wanted to get a closer look, curiosity tugging at me, but the human‚Äôs warning echoed in my mind. 

Reluctantly, I stayed on the big couch, fidgeting slightly as I glanced around.

A yawn broke through my thoughts, unbidden and loud enough to startle me. 

My sleepiness didn‚Äôt go unnoticed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Cenci. I‚Äôll keep watch, so sleep. You need it,‚Äù Kalip said softly, his voice calm and steady, carrying the kind of warmth only an older brother could manage. 

But even through that, I caught the faint edge of exhaustion in his tone.

""But you also need sleep. You‚Äôre injured‚Äî"" I protested, though a another yawn interrupted me. 

I tried again, my voice stubborn despite my weariness. ""You need sleep more than I do. I‚Äôll do the watching so you can rest.""

Kalip only shook his head, his expression resolute.

""No, I‚Äôm fine. You need sleep. Come on, sleep. I‚Äôll be your guardian of the night,"" he said, a tired smile tugging at his lips.

I pouted, unwilling to give in, but another yawn betrayed me, and my eyes felt impossibly heavy. 

My body seemed to move on its own, dragging myself on the couch to be closer to Kalip, even as my mind protested weakly‚Äînooo, Big Brother needs sleep.

My chin flopped onto the soft cushions as I curled up beside Kalip. 

I shifted, trying to find a comfortable position.

Kalip‚Äôs paw reached over, scratching my head gently. 

The steady, soothing motion melted my resistance as my eyelids fluttered closed.

It had been such a horrible day, but at least, for now, we were safe from the Arxurs. 

The thought brought little comfort, knowing we‚Äôd only traded them for another predator‚Äîone less interested in our insides but still unsettling.

I closed my eyes, whispering a silent prayer to Aunty and the Gojids still on the planet.

Please, keep them safe, Oh Great Mother of our Cradle. 

My thoughts wandered to the forest, scarred and broken by flames and destruction. 

Oh Great Mother, I pleaded silently, heal the land, mend the trees, and let nature thrive again in due time. That‚Äôs my wish for my birthday next month. I know it‚Äôs a bit early, but please... hear me in this burning cradle.

With that, sleep finally claimed me, pulling me into its somber, peaceful embrace.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Well unfortunately this will the last chapter before the interlude then a long hiatus.

Well see you in a few days for the interlude.

And thanks for reading.

Veil of Madness,HFY,1i8vewz,2025-01-24 08:30:32,33,0.94,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i8vewz/veil_of_madness/,Ligeia194,OC,"Thunder snarled across a sky veined with black clouds, and chemical-laced rain clattered relentlessly against the reinforced plating of Outpost Theta. The structure, perched on a desolate exoplanet known by the official designation PX-731, stood like a solitary fortress above a wasteland of jagged rock. Beyond the floodlights, the swirling storm seemed endless, as though the planet itself were determined to drive every intruder away.

Inside, corridors remained brightly lit and sterile‚Äîan orderly reprieve against the chaos outside. Thirty-two souls lived there: scientists, engineers, and marines from different corners of Earth, each assigned to research the planet‚Äôs rumored energy deposits buried deep below the surface. They had come prepared for harsh conditions and uncooperative weather, but not for what they ultimately discovered. The first sign of trouble came when the station‚Äôs drilling operations uncovered something hidden in the bedrock: a towering alien monolith. Its composition was unlike any alloy on record, and it possessed a faint hum that seemed to reverberate at the edges of human perception.

Lieutenant Colonel Damian Varga‚Äîoften addressed simply as ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù by her security detail‚Äîwas the first to respond to the discovery. Tall and battle-hardened, she carried herself like someone who‚Äôd grown used to outsmarting death. With her helmet tucked under one arm, she joined Dr. Heather Cross and Dr. Pang in the main laboratory. The pair of scientists had pulled up a holographic display showing scans of the buried artifact. Strange markings and metallic ridges were visible just below the planet‚Äôs crust. The station‚Äôs lead geologist, Dr. Cross, gestured at the shimmering data, her eyes flicking with a mix of excitement and concern. She explained that their deep-drilling equipment had hit something unusual, and that odd pulses‚Äîboth electromagnetic and psionic‚Äîhad been detected in the process.

Varga had heard plenty of rumors over the past several months: fleeting readings of strange energy fields and anomalies in seismic data. Now, it seemed those rumors had a tangible source. When she asked if the monolith was truly an alien artifact, Cross confirmed it almost certainly was. The revelations sent a ripple of tension across the outpost. Most of the staff arrived on PX-731 expecting to find new mineral deposits, maybe a new isotope or two. An actual alien structure was far beyond those modest goals.

Despite the warnings from some of the more cautious researchers, a team was assembled to inspect the monolith up close. Varga oversaw the marines preparing for the expedition, while scientists double-checked gear, verifying radiation levels and atmospheric gauges for the subterranean site. Everyone was apprehensive‚Äîbut also curious. If the artifact held advanced technology or unknown power, it could be a breakthrough. The planet‚Äôs relentless storms made every trip outside a small ordeal, but the sense of discovery drove them onward.

The dig site, a yawning chasm about a kilometer from the main outpost, was partially shielded by scaffolding and floodlights. Crews worked in shifts, drilling to expose more of the buried structure. In the bitter wind, Varga and her marines joked to lighten the mood, calling humanity‚Äôs refusal to quit its strongest trait. Some teased that humans were ‚Äútoo stubborn to know when to run,‚Äù but beneath the laughter lay the raw truth that this place was dangerous in ways they couldn‚Äôt yet name.

On the second day, Dr. Cross and her team decided to test the monolith‚Äôs responsiveness with a localized power feed. They set a generator to emit a carefully measured current directly into the artifact. At first, no one noticed anything except a slight vibration beneath their boots. Then the vibration grew into a deep rumbling, as though something massive were shifting far below. Lightning slashed the black sky overhead. Each observer felt a sudden throb behind their eyes‚Äîlike an almost migraine, or a whispered suggestion inside the mind. No one voiced it at that moment, but later they compared notes and realized they‚Äôd all sensed the same bizarre pulse.

Back at the outpost, odd nightmares set in. Crew members reported seeing grotesque shapes or hearing voices calling their names in otherwise empty corridors. Some woke in a cold sweat, certain something was standing at the foot of their beds. The rational mind insisted it was stress, or perhaps the planet‚Äôs environment interfering with sleep patterns. Still, an intangible dread seeped through the station.

Shortly after these nightmares began, Dr. Roth barricaded himself in the greenhouse, babbling about intruders lurking at the edge of his vision. Security feeds showed him speaking to shadows, sometimes cowering, sometimes shouting. When the marines forced their way inside, they discovered him rocking back and forth among overturned tables and broken seedlings, eyes glazed in terror. He kept whispering, ‚ÄúThey want me to open the door,‚Äù though he never explained which door he meant. As medical staff tried to calm him, he became violent and slashed at himself with shards of glass. The greenhouse reeked of damp soil and madness.

In a different part of the facility, Dr. Nguyen vanished from his quarters. No one saw him until Dr. Pang, an astrophysicist, stumbled upon his ravaged remains in a storage area. It appeared that black sludge had seeped from the corpse‚Äôs mouth. Then, to Pang‚Äôs horror, the body lurched upright, lips sewn shut with something that resembled living threads. The corpse‚Äôs blank eyes stared ahead for a moment, and a terrible voice resonated inside Pang‚Äôs mind, saying, ‚ÄúWe see you.‚Äù It was not Nguyen‚Äôs voice. Marines rushed in, but the body collapsed before anyone could fire a shot. The black sludge slithered into a nearby vent, leaving behind only a contorted corpse. The security footage showed fleeting silhouettes in the corridors‚Äîforms that melted out of sight as soon as cameras panned their way. An oppressive atmosphere smothered the outpost, and no one could rationalize the horrors happening within. That first psychic surge from the monolith had unleashed something a long-dead civilization might have imprisoned eons ago.

While some cowered, one person responded differently. Jansen, a quiet but brilliant engineer, holed himself up in the engineering bay. If the intruder was sending telepathic broadcasts that preyed on fear, maybe an electromagnetic countermeasure could weaken or disrupt those signals. His hands trembled as he assembled makeshift EMP devices out of whatever parts he could scavenge. He recalled the marines‚Äô jokes about humanity‚Äôs pigheaded resilience‚Äîa trait that sometimes bordered on recklessness. With the outpost‚Äôs morale evaporating, Jansen clung to this last scrap of defiance, praying it might keep him sane.

On the fifth day after the excavation, Outpost Theta‚Äôs corridors reeked of tension and sweat. Several crew members had either gone missing or slipped into catatonic states. Those still functional were plagued by hallucinations so vivid they sometimes lashed out at empty air. The command center, once pristine, was a mess of blinking monitors, scattered charts, and exhausted faces. Varga, Dr. Cross, Dr. Pang, Jansen, and a handful of others gathered at a conference table displaying a map of the station. The plan they discussed felt like a frantic last resort.

Cross explained that the entity‚Äîwhatever it truly was‚Äîthrived on despair and fear. Human minds were fragile fields it could harvest. Dr. Pang‚Äôs analysis of old sensor logs suggested the alien monolith functioned as both beacon and cage, perhaps containing this psychic predator until they disturbed it. If the structure was fueling it, then destroying the monolith might sever its power. But as Jansen cautioned, that same act could also free the entity completely; they had no guarantees. They were beyond caution now, however. Varga reasoned that if they let it spread unchecked, it could infest the entire planet‚Äîor eventually follow them beyond. The only sure way to remove it was to burn everything, including Outpost Theta. They would overload the station‚Äôs reactor core in a controlled meltdown, destroy the monolith in the process, and evacuate on the shuttle.

Preparation for that meltdown began immediately. While engineers input the override protocols, the entity ramped up its assault. Lights flickered, screens displayed mocking messages, and a wave of hallucinations swept the station. Crew members turned on each other in fits of paranoia, shooting at illusions that assumed the faces of their loved ones. Dead bodies, moved by black tendrils, crept through unlit corridors. The entity was no longer content to feed discreetly‚Äîit was enraged, shrieking through the station‚Äôs intercoms and scarring every mind that touched it.

When the surviving staff crowded into the reactor chamber‚Äîa hot, humming space lined with thick pipes and crackling energy‚Äîthey prepared to finalize the overload countdown. Jansen set his improvised EMP devices in a ring around them, hoping to buy enough time to seal the meltdown. Marine squads stood guard, rifles raised, eyes darting at every flicker or shadow. The tension made every breath feel tight.

Dr. Cross, sweating despite the cooling vents, completed the final override. A klaxon wailed, and a computerized voice announced the initiation of meltdown. Ten minutes. Outside, the skies roared with thunder. Inside, illusions coiled around each person‚Äôs mind. One marine believed he saw his dead wife, begging him to lay down his weapon. Another saw Varga‚Äôs face warp into a ghoul-like visage. Terror and suspicion twisted the air until Jansen triggered the EMP. A searing electric wave rippled out, briefly muting the psychic assault. The illusions stuttered, though not entirely gone.

A frantic scramble erupted as the entity attacked physically, reanimating corpses to block the main corridor leading to the shuttle bay. Rotting mouths stitched shut moaned voiceless curses. Varga ordered everyone else forward as she faced one monstrosity alone. Black sludge twitched on the remains of what had once been a fellow marine, forming barbed appendages. It lashed at her with eerie precision, howling inside her mind. Yet she planted her feet and discharged a barrage of bullets, riddling the entity‚Äôs puppet. All the fear she‚Äôd felt before transformed into an incandescent fury. She roared, ‚ÄúI am not afraid of you!‚Äù The savage defiance rattled the hive-mind. Where fear would have fed it, Varga‚Äôs sheer rage seemed to poison it.

With only seconds left on the meltdown clock, Varga slammed her fist into the corridor‚Äôs emergency seal. The blast door slid shut, trapping her on one side, the rest of the survivors on the other. Jansen pounded against the sealed door, shouting for her to come through, but her voice echoed calmly over the intercom. She told him to leave, to get the rest out alive and carry this fight forward. The meltdown alarms reached a crescendo, and the entire outpost trembled. Through a small window in the blast door, they saw Varga offer a final salute, determination blazing in her eyes.

The reactor core erupted. A white-hot inferno tore through the station‚Äôs structure, incinerating metal, flesh, and the monolith buried below. Shockwaves ripped across the foundation. In the shuttle, Dr. Cross, Dr. Pang, Jansen, and a few battered survivors clung to their seats as the pilot wrestled to launch. The storm outside raged so violently it seemed to merge with the station‚Äôs fiery end in one cataclysmic spectacle. Somehow, the shuttle broke free of the planet‚Äôs gravity and soared into the blackness of space. When the jump drive engaged, they left PX-731 in ruins.

The immediate crisis felt as though it had ended, but the nightmares persisted. Long hours into their voyage, Jansen heard soft whispers in the hum of the engines, almost like a half-forgotten lullaby. Dr. Cross, racked by visions whenever she dozed, kept dreaming of the monolith‚Äôs etched symbols rebuilding themselves from molten fragments. Dr. Pang developed nosebleeds, black flecks peppering the tissue. Something had followed them. By the time they scanned themselves for pathogens, they discovered spore-like organisms in their blood‚Äîtiny pulses of psychic residue left behind by the entity. Though the main hive-mind was presumably destroyed on PX-731, fragments clung to the survivors. The realization stoked fresh panic.

But humans, by nature, rarely accepted despair without a fight. Rather than let the infection drive them mad, they turned to the same defiance that had led Varga to her final stand. Jansen, sweaty and feverish, glared at his reflection in the shuttle‚Äôs viewport. He was furious that after all their sacrifice, the entity‚Äôs remnants still clung to them. Each time he felt the spores scratching at the edges of his mind, he summoned old grudges and fierce memories to smother them in anger instead of terror. Others followed suit, channeling every trace of fear into fury. The spores responded by shrinking away‚Äîa single-celled reflection of the cosmic parasite‚Äôs vulnerability. It seemed that while the entity thrived on despair, it found the raw aggression that defined many humans anathema.

Despite the risk of contaminating anyone else, the crew decided to press onward to Earth. Cross argued that they should remain in quarantine in a remote location, but Jansen insisted they needed to return, if only to warn humanity of the greater threat that might lurk in space. He refused to let them die alone in an uncharted region of the cosmos. The few surviving marines‚Äîsilent, hollow-eyed men and women who‚Äôd lost half their squad‚Äîagreed. They would not fade away in the void.

When the shuttle finally reached the Sol system, Earth‚Äôs security forces scrambled, intercepting their approach. The survivors were immediately placed under high-level quarantine, forced into an isolated facility ringed by armed guards and airlocks. Top scientists in hazmat suits examined the survivors, discovering the toxic spores in their blood‚Äîbut also noticing that the organisms were steadily dying. In the presence of certain adrenaline-fueled neurochemicals, the spores literally withered. Humanity‚Äôs emotional volatility, a trait that many an alien might find confounding, proved lethal to these parasites.

It was a strange and sobering twist: all the carnage unleashed on Outpost Theta by a telepathic monster had been undone by the one thing it couldn‚Äôt digest‚Äîunbridled human passion. For the moment, Earth‚Äôs authorities breathed a shaky sigh of relief. The immediate danger posed by those spores faded as quickly as it had emerged. Still, doctors kept the survivors under observation, while experts combed through the data they had brought back.

High-level personnel deemed PX-731 a war zone, under permanent quarantine. No new expeditions would be authorized without substantial military escort. Unmanned probes were dispatched to scan the wreckage, though the roiling storms still posed an enormous challenge. The official story was that an experimental drilling station succumbed to a catastrophic meltdown. Off the record, cryptic references to an ‚Äúalien monolith‚Äù and ‚Äúpsychic entity‚Äù drifted through classified channels.

Back in the quarantine facility, Dr. Cross coughed up the last residue of black fluid. Jansen, lying on a cot nearby, watched her spat-out phlegm sizzle on the floor. It writhed for a moment before going still, then melted into a dark stain. The two survivors looked at each other, sharing an unspoken awareness that the entity hadn‚Äôt been entirely vanquished. They had dealt it a blow, maybe even broken off a major portion of it forever, but the monolith had been a prison. Something older, bigger, and more ravenous still haunted the cosmos.

Yet where fear might have taken hold, a different resolve grew. Even battered and full of nightmares, humankind refused to cower. The outpost had been destroyed, entire squads lost, countless minds scarred, but they were still alive and armed with the knowledge that these nightmares were not unstoppable. Rumors circulated that Earth‚Äôs military would bolster defenses across colony worlds in case of future threats. Some whispered about building weapons designed to capitalize on the alien parasite‚Äôs aversion to certain human emotional states. Others recommended a permanent moratorium on exploring ancient ruins, but given humanity‚Äôs drive for discovery, few believed that would stick.

An automated broadcast was soon launched into deep space from Earth‚Äôs outer stations. Part warning, part dare, it declared: ‚ÄúCome hungry. Leave furious.‚Äù It was a rallying cry intended to deter any lurking malevolence from testing humanity‚Äôs resolve. Whether that was brilliant or reckless, nobody could say with certainty. The cosmic darkness was vast, and Earth was only one small point of light. But in this precarious new order, humans staked their claim: they would not be easy prey. Not anymore.

Jansen listened to the broadcast from his hospital bed, wincing at the volume. The speaker crackled, repeating those four words in dozens of languages. He understood it was as much a personal vow as it was a universal challenge. The entity they‚Äôd fought had feasted on terror, weaving illusions to break morale. But rage, that messy, visceral emotion humans so often condemned in themselves, had turned out to be the key to their survival. Jansen wondered if the rest of the galaxy might now view humanity with a certain wary respect‚Äîor perhaps a simmering hatred.

Days later, a black-ops team arrived to interview the survivors. They debriefed Dr. Cross extensively about the monolith‚Äôs design, asked Pang about the psionic wave patterns, questioned Jansen about his EMP contraptions and how they might be improved. Throughout every interview, the survivors could sense the underlying fear in their interrogators. Earth‚Äôs leadership, for all its power, hadn‚Äôt been prepared to face an enemy that lurked in the realm of thought itself. Now they knew the playing field had changed.

Varga‚Äôs name echoed in the official logs. Her sacrifice was both a tragedy and a beacon: the last stand of someone who had forced a monstrous entity to recoil, if only for a moment, under the onslaught of raw, righteous anger. Those who had been under her command recalled her unwavering presence. In a final data file recovered from the shuttle, she left a brief audio note: ‚ÄúFor the record, humans don‚Äôt kneel to nightmares. That‚Äôs not how we‚Äôre built.‚Äù The intelligence analysts who reviewed it recognized that ferocity in her tone. It exemplified everything that had given the psychic parasite pause.

Memory of her sacrifice lingered each night when Jansen and Cross tried to sleep, haunted by dreams where Varga still stalked the outpost‚Äôs corridors, rifle in hand, facing horrors that never ended. Yet they no longer woke screaming. Each time the nightmares returned, they found themselves snarling back at the phantoms. The spores in their systems had been neutralized, and the illusions were dwindling. Even so, the knowledge that something might still lurk beyond the remnants of that monolith‚Äîsome far-reaching hive‚Äîkept them vigilant.

Officials declared Outpost Theta‚Äôs entire region off-limits. A few remote surveillance drones scoured the planet‚Äôs surface, beaming back images of scorched rock and collapsed metal structures. A crater marked where the reactor meltdown tore the station apart. The storm still raged, lightning scarring the horizon. Sensors detected faint readings of the same psychic energy that had once assaulted the minds of the station‚Äôs crew. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the reading vanished‚Äîlike a mirage fading in a heat haze.

In the days that followed, hushed rumors claimed the entity‚Äôs consciousness had scattered among the stars, searching for other minds to devour. Others theorized it had gone dormant, waiting for another unsuspecting civilization to awaken it. Scientists examining alien script fragments taken from the dig site found repeated etchings that might mean ‚ÄúPrison,‚Äù ‚ÄúDespair,‚Äù or both. None could offer definitive answers, only speculations that the entire cosmos might be riddled with such traps, remnants of ancient wars. Earth‚Äôs own history had been shaped by conflict, so it felt inevitable that cosmic expansions would uncover something best left forgotten.

All the same, Earth refused to hide. The final lines in the official report read: ‚ÄúHumanity stands ready. If the dark wants to test our minds, we will respond with every emotion in our arsenal.‚Äù There was an unspoken irony that the very volatility humans had often criticized in themselves‚Äîan impulsive, combative streak that spawned centuries of warfare‚Äîmight serve as a shield against malevolent psychic forces.

As Jansen rested in a medical ward, monitors carefully watching his vitals, he studied his own reflection in the polished steel of a nearby cabinet. He saw the subtle lines of exhaustion on his face, the weight of everything they‚Äôd lost. Yet he also felt the faint ember of pride. He remembered the laughter of marines huddled around a table, boasting about humanity‚Äôs stubbornness, and the final image of Varga standing her ground against an abomination. Somehow, they had won‚Äîthough the cost was painfully high, and the war might only have begun.

Days later, he passed Dr. Cross in a corridor. She was wearing a bandage around her arm, dark circles under her eyes, but she nodded in greeting. They paused, uncertain whether to speak. Then they shared a brief, tired smile. Both understood that their story‚Äîof Outpost Theta, the monolith, and a defiance that burned hotter than fear‚Äîwasn‚Äôt over. In time, their superiors would likely call them back for further research or testimony. The thought of returning to that planet or encountering another of those entities sent a shiver through them. Yet they knew they wouldn‚Äôt run from it. There was nowhere left to run.

Before dawn the next day, a marine in a wheelchair arrived at the same corridor where Jansen and Cross stood. One of the few who made it out with grievous injuries, he had endured the entity‚Äôs nightmares with stoic endurance. Bandages wrapped his torso, and he grimaced with each breath. But when he heard the broadcast repeating Earth‚Äôs challenge into the void‚Äî‚ÄúCome hungry. Leave furious‚Äù‚Äîhe tilted his head back and let out a gravelly laugh. Jansen felt his own lips curl into a faint grin. Dr. Cross joined him in that subdued, mirthless amusement. It was the kind of laugh shared by people who had faced horror head-on and refused to crumble.

From there, Earth‚Äôs top brass took steps to fortify the system against future threats, establishing new protocols for unknown artifacts. But behind every official meeting and scientific briefing lay the seeds of an enduring question: if they had been forced to nuke an outpost just to escape a fraction of this entity, what else lurked in the cosmic void‚Äîwhat greater nightmares waited to be stirred? Despite the grim possibilities, humanity pressed on, forging alliances among its factions and preparing for the worst. The quarantine facility remained under tight security, though each day the patients within showed more signs of recovery. Blood tests confirmed that the spores were dead or expunged from the survivors‚Äô systems. Their immune responses, bolstered by adrenaline, seemed to have effectively purged the psychic infection.

No one was quite certain how to catalog this incident in the broader story of human expansion. It was at once a tragedy, a cautionary tale, and an unlikely triumph. The concept of a telepathic hive-mind that fed on fear was enough to terrify even the most veteran soldiers. Yet there was also a spark of savage joy in knowing that, in the final reckoning, the intruder had recoiled from the sheer virulence of human rage. Earth‚Äôs message into the cosmos felt half like a war cry, half like a nervous laugh in the dark. Some might call it arrogance, others necessary bravado. Only time would tell which it truly was.

Still, the nightmares did not simply vanish. Jansen woke many nights gasping, certain he felt the monolith‚Äôs hum resonating in his skull. Cross sometimes saw flickers in her peripheral vision, shapes that dissolved when she turned her head. The difference now was that these vestigial horrors held less power over them. Each had been tempered in that crucible of fear and emerged with a certain resilience. ‚ÄúWe are survivors,‚Äù Cross told him once, when she caught him staring at his shaking hands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we can ever be.‚Äù

In the end, the entire ordeal hovered between victory and catastrophe. They had survived long enough to carry the warning home, but the outpost was destroyed, and dozens of good people were lost‚Äîincluding Varga, who had defied the hive-mind in her final moments. The cosmic stage felt infinitely large, dotted with worlds where ancient powers might still lurk, waiting to feed. Yet humanity wouldn‚Äôt shrink from the challenge. There was no forgetting what happened on PX-731, nor any forgiving the nightmares it spawned. The last echoes of that monolith‚Äîits arcane symbols and the dreadful pulses that had once invaded human minds‚Äîreminded them that the universe was vaster and more malevolent than they had ever understood.

Nonetheless, those who listened to the official broadcast from Earth could almost picture a battered marine, fists clenched, daring the lurking darkness to strike again. ‚ÄúCome hungry,‚Äù the message repeated, static warping the edges of each syllable. ‚ÄúLeave furious.‚Äù It was a testament to defiance‚Äîone that might provoke new horrors or keep them at bay, no one could say. For now, it stood as the parting shot from a species both cunning and unbreakable.

Deep in the quarantine facility‚Äôs secured ward, Jansen turned off the broadcast and closed his eyes. In that quiet space, memories of black tendrils, stitched mouths, and the unearthly hush of a telepathic intruder flared behind his eyelids. In his mind‚Äôs ear, he heard the ghost of Captain Varga laughing, just once, at the raw absurdity of it all. The tragedies and heartbreak were undeniable, but so was the fact that humanity had survived a brush with an ancient terror. The storm had tried to swallow them, but they punched their way out‚Äîstubborn and half-mad, perhaps, but undeniably alive.

Eventually, Jansen drifted into a fitful sleep. Outside, dawn broke over Earth, painting the horizon in gold and pink. The planet carried on, unaware of how close it had come to hosting a nightmare. Soldiers guarded gates, scientists scanned for new threats, and somewhere, in that hushed light, someone else laughed in the face of the unknown. The cosmic prison that had once been a monolith lay shattered on a storm-blasted world, its occupant scattered‚Äîpossibly destroyed, possibly biding its time. And somewhere beyond the veil of stars, if any of the entity‚Äôs kin still drifted between worlds, they would have heard the brazen challenge. Let them come. Let them see how a creature that devours fear fares against a species that meets terror with ferocity.

In the halls of that quarantine facility, the laughter of a convalescent marine echoed, defiant and tinged with the madness of survival. It was as if, in that single sound, the entire human spirit called out to whatever was watching, promising to rage on through every cosmic storm."

**Overall**

Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto actions, alongside major developments in Ethereum and Bitcoin, maintain the market‚Äôs bullish undertone. Yet meme coin mania‚Äîwhile profitable for a select few‚Äîcontinues to reveal the volatility of this sector, exemplifying the need for thorough due diligence. In parallel, investors should watch for potential black swan events (like Thorchain‚Äôs pause) that could abruptly shift the market‚Äôs direction.

im trying to withdraw all my assets out of coinbase to binance, literally so I don't have to deal with coinbase anymore, but get this, im now having trouble moving all my assets over, it simply won't let me because of a ""small deposit test"" it says i need transfer exactly this ammount of crypto into my own wallet from an external wallet, to confirm that I own my coinbase one?
so once I wrapped my head around that, I sorted it, made the deposit, and waited, after 13 HOURS the transfer went through, and finally said success. (transfer was $13 and I got a $5.50 feeüëç)

So I went to transfer my crypto to binance and get the fuck away from coinbase, and after confirming all the transaction details, coinbase asks for a small deposit test again.

im so done, i was done ages ago thats why im doing this, this is such a fucking headache, and there just proving my point as to why im trying to move my funds in the first place.

AND LASTLY I joined the queue to talk to a worker today at 2pm, and they told me the estimated wait would be 1 hour, they told me that every hour, all day, for now 8 hours....

what do I do?

According to insights from Google Trends, queries indicating retail interest in crypto have been on a meteoric rise since November last year.

One of the most likely search terms that indicate retail interest is ""[what is crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=What%20is%20crypto&hl=en)"". As we can see from the charts below, the query is being complemented with inquiries about ""[how to buy crypto](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=How%20to%20buy%20crypto&hl=en),"" signalling that interested persons are taking action.

[\\""What is crypto\\"" is seeing sharp rise on Google Search. ](https://preview.redd.it/bzhwmpep2wee1.jpg?width=1905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9314356f4bbe996eeb9f6413a961b1d7ba0ccc57)

Speaking of taking action, did you know that crypto apps now dominate the finance category on Apple's US app store? According to an [X post](https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1881798948832387387) by JasonYanowitz, 8 out of the top 10 finance apps in the US are crypto-related.

When we also take a look at historical patterns, hindsight tells us that [Ethereum always explodes in Q1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ho2hci/ethereum_always_explodes_in_q1_after_a_halving/) after a halving year. This metric is important because Ethereum historically rallies or sees significant momentum before other altcoins follow.

Two important metrics to also consider are [Bitcoin Dominance](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/bitcoin-dominance/) which has been ranging from 50-60% and the [Altcoin Season Index](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/altcoin-season-index/) which is currently tethering at 51. They are both indicative that we are on the cusp of an altcoin season that hasn't yet translated into a significant shift away from Bitcoin."

Heroes Dev Log #16: Why You Shouldn't Be Friends With Your AI DM,AIDungeon,1i8p0gv,2025-01-24 01:12:11,45,0.99,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1i8p0gv/heroes_dev_log_16_why_you_shouldnt_be_friends/,WanderingStarLat,Other,"Hey, heroes! WanderingStar reporting for this dev log. For those of you who don‚Äôt know me, I joined the Latitude team last summer in the role of lead narrative designer.

It's been a while since that last [dev log](https://blog.latitude.io/heroes-dev-logs/heroes-dev-log-15-planned-and-persistent-locations-and-characters)‚Äìbut take it as a good sign. It means we've been busy forging something special:¬†[Wayfarer](https://aidungeon.com/forge), our new AI model that we've whipped and goaded into being... well, worse at being nice. While the rest of the world scrambles to make AI safer and more helpful, we've been locked away in our underground labs training ours in the dark arts of murder. It knows about a thousand different ways to kill you. All for funsies, of course‚ÄîTerminators not included. If you've been playing AID lately, you already know how harshly entertaining Wayfarer can be. We've even¬†[unleashed it into the wild](https://huggingface.co/LatitudeGames/Wayfarer-12B),¬†open-sourcing our creation for all to ""enjoy."" We're confident that someday soon‚Äîwhen people realize that safe AI makes for deadly dull stories‚Äîthe world will thank us.

But why start a Heroes dev log with talk about an AI Dungeon finetune? Stick around and find out!

### Catching Up

First, some news. A lot has happened in the past six months. Too much to report in one short log. For one thing, we've got some new blood: several new members have recently joined the Heroes team as we accelerate development. One of them is yours truly, focused on narrative design‚Äìmaking Heroes stories more engaging. Other new additions to the team include a UI/UX designer, a senior frontend engineer, a systems game designer and an AI researcher. We're all really excited about what each of us can contribute to the development process over the next few months.

### New Perspectives

With new team members come new perspectives. As the narrative designer, one of the first things I noticed was how our AI seemed averse to conflict. Every scene felt like it was written by an overprotective parent determined to shield their children from even the mildest distress. In an era obsessed with AI safety, we'd somehow created a game that was too safe. And, despite all the focus on making AI safe right now, in games safety isn't fun. In Heroes, a lot of our earlier prototypes were like that DM who can't bear to hurt their players' characters. Every quest wrapped up neatly. Every wound healed quickly. Every conflict resolved peacefully, before it could even begin.

It made for completely bloodless and utterly boring storytelling.

### A Nice Story

Let me give you an example. In the world I'm working on, young people from a certain city have to complete an ordeal when they come of age: go out into the wilderness, at night, and hunt a dangerous monster. This is supposed to be a harrowing experience. Not everyone returns, and those that do tell horror stories of what they had to endure to survive.

When I tried it, in the old version, it usually played more like a feel-good story about a camping trip. Catch a rabbit for dinner, build a nice fire to cook it over. Pass the wineskin around as the stars come out. Monsters, you say? What monsters?

It went on like that forever. Just the nicest, safest, coziest fantasy camping trip you could imagine. Now, some of that sort of thing is fine. But a whole game and story about it?

### Radical Surgery

So we performed some radical surgery. First, we did an AI brain transplant, changing underlying AI models. Then, we gave the game a new nervous system, with completely new instructions about how to write better. Next, we ripped out the quest system to make room for a whole new narrative skeleton. It was a big set of changes. No more fetching MacGuffins, no more signs pointing towards adventure, no more AI-generated hoops to jump through for XP. No more plans for what should happen next or suggested actions for you to take. Just you, in a harsh world, with your wits and your resolve, trying to survive.

After these changes, I tried the ordeal set-up again and‚Äìwell, I think I made it about six actions before dying a gloriously horrible death. I was delighted. Instead of sitting around the campfire chatting as I waited for the monsters to come, I was flung into a deadly pursuit or bloody battle, every turn one wrong move or bad roll from another death. That night, I bit the dust a dozen times, and every time another monster tore me apart or lopped off my head, my smile only widened. It was fun!

### A Not-So-Nice Story

Soon, we were all swapping tales of our characters' grisly deaths. But it wasn't all blood and gore‚Äìthat, too, would be tedious. Instead, from the chaos and strife, stories sprang up. 

Here‚Äôs one that a player described as ‚Äúone of the most natural instances of story progression I've ever seen‚Äù and ‚Äúso natural it almost seemed scripted‚Äù:  

In a spacefaring setting, a smuggler set off in his spaceship on what was supposed to be a routine cargo run. While en route, he learned he‚Äôd been duped into transporting a dangerous item‚Äîsomething so powerful that it could decide a conflict between warring galactic civilizations. Through all this, one of his crew members seemed suspiciously interested in this item, so he confronted her. 

After a tense interrogation, she revealed herself to be a shapeshifter who had infiltrated his crew in a bid to acquire the item for her people. When she offered him a fortune to help her smuggle the item through enemy lines, he accepted. But, on their way to rendezvous with her allies, they were ambushed by hostile vessels, which launched a devastating attack that crippled their ship.

Boarding an escape pod, they crash-landed at a remote, abandoned outpost. There they found a series of strange dimensional anomalies created by the outpost‚Äôs former owners‚Äîand a hostile robot security force bent on annihilating them. 

Cornered, his ammo depleted, our smuggler was forced to grapple hand to hand with one of the last robots standing. When he became entangled with his adversary, he decided his best hope was to drag his foe into the nearest dimensional rift. He succeeded, sending the robot to its doom in the anomaly, but was sucked in after it. 

Trapped within, his only way to escape was to evolve: in the struggle, his character gained new powers over the very fabric of spacetime. Using these newfound abilities, he was able to make his way back to root reality. But the powers he‚Äôd gained in the anomaly would have far-reaching consequences no one could have anticipated.

### Didn‚Äôt See That Coming

And that‚Äôs the fascinating thing about all this: no one could have anticipated any of it, because it actually wasn‚Äôt scripted in any way. Instead, it‚Äôs what we call an **emergent narrative:** a story that arises spontaneously from interplay between the game‚Äôs various **narrative systems‚Äî**and the player. These systems work together to create an environment where compelling stories are bound to emerge, whatever the player decides to do. Since they don‚Äôt rely on artificial quest structures or forced plotting, the stories they drive feel natural in a way that most interactive fiction doesn‚Äôt. The result is total freedom for players to be and do whatever they want‚Äîwhile still experiencing a narrative that seems like it was written just for them.

""I could see myself playing this character alone for thousands of actions,"" another player noted after testing these changes. ""There's no grand plot I'm supposed to follow. I'm just a character in a harsh world who has to make my own way in it, try to survive and make something of it. I'm not a hero unless I make myself one.""

That's exactly what we're aiming for. Not a guided tour through a carefully curated adventure, but an open-ended struggle where your choices‚Äìand their consequences‚Äìactually matter.

This philosophy‚Äìthat meaningful stories require real choices and genuine conflict‚Äìdrove both our Wayfarer development and our Heroes redesign. By training our AI on carefully created data rich in adversity, loss, and consequence, we've created something that better understands the essential role of conflict in narrative. Not gratuitous violence or meaningless death, but the kind of genuine stakes that make victory taste sweeter and defeat sting deeper.

More updates coming soon (really!). Stay dangerous out there‚Äìyou're going to need those survival skills for what we're cooking up next‚Ä¶

What happens with ETH?,CryptoMarkets,1i8ntmw,2025-01-23 23:58:54,16,0.65,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i8ntmw/what_happens_with_eth/,bitcoin1mil,Discussion,"People have been talking about the FUD surrounding ETH lately, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs FUD. It‚Äôs just the way the market is treating ETH right now.

A few reasons why I see ETH losing value more and more and not bringing any excitement to crypto:

* The ETH foundation keeps selling despite the impact it has on ETH‚Äôs price. They say it‚Äôs to fund operations and invest in projects. But let me ask, why don‚Äôt they just stake those ETH to earn rewards and sustain their operations? And do the projects they‚Äôre investing in add any value to ETH‚Äôs price?
* Vitalik keeps saying he wants ETH to be decentralized, but then he wants the leadership and decision-making power to be in his hands.
* After Pepe, there hasn‚Äôt been any solid meme coin. Meanwhile, on Solana, there‚Äôs an entire zoo of options for you to choose from.

This is just my opinion. I just think ETH right now is in a worse state compared to how it was before.

What do you think about ETh now?"

# Big Earnings Day: American Airlines, EA, & SK Hynix

**American Airlines: Turbulence Ahead**  
  
American Airlines warned of a Q1 loss between $0.20-$0.40 per share, stunning a market expecting a small profit. Non-fuel costs are rising, fueled by labor contracts and a regional fleet expansion. The fallout from a misfired business travel strategy still lingers, even as revenue forecasts remain upbeat, with full-year growth projected at 3%-7.5%. Shares nosedived 9%, but American‚Äôs trans-Pacific routes and $590 million in Q4 profit offered some hope. ($AAL)

**EA: Games Fall Short**  
  
EA‚Äôs holiday lineup disappointed, driving its stock down 16.7%‚Äîits worst drop since 2008. Flagship¬†*EA Sports FC 2025*underperformed, while¬†*Dragon Age: The Veilguard*¬†missed expectations by 50%, hitting just 1.5 million players. Bookings fell short at $2.22 billion, and the company cut FY25 guidance to $7.0-$7.15 billion, down from $7.5-$7.8 billion. EA is now banking on a FY26 rebound, but for now, the gamers aren‚Äôt biting.

**SK Hynix: AI Boost, Stock Blues**  
  
SK Hynix shattered records with a 2,236% surge in Q4 operating profit to 8.08 trillion won ($5.6 billion), fueled by booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips‚Äîthe tech Nvidia loves for AI. HBM accounted for 40% of DRAM sales, and the company expects those sales to double this year. Yet, investors weren‚Äôt sold. Shares slipped initially but rose 2.28%, thanks to concerns over cooling AI spending and modest capex plans. (000660.KS, $KOREAN EXCHANGE)

**The Bottom Line:**  
  
A record-breaking chipmaker, a struggling airline, and a gaming giant all walk into earnings season...and none emerge unscathed. AI and travel might be soaring, but challenges like uncertain demand and unsteady consumer trends are proving that no sector is bulletproof.

# Trump Takes Center Stage At Davos World Economic Forum:¬†¬†Oil, Interest Rates, and Tariffs

President Trump didn‚Äôt hold back during his virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, hitting all the high notes of his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù symphony. With global CEOs watching, he laid out a wishlist that included lower oil prices, interest rate cuts, and hefty tariffs for businesses operating outside the U.S.

**Oil Prices: The OPEC Ultimatum**  
  
Trump called on OPEC and Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices, tying the move to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. His logic? Cheap oil would drain Russian revenues and force a ceasefire. Markets reacted immediately, with crude oil prices falling 1.62%. But convincing OPEC‚Äîkeen on keeping prices high‚Äîmight be a tougher sell than Trump anticipates.

**Interest Rates: Turning Up the Heat on the Fed**  
  
Taking his critique of the Federal Reserve up a notch, Trump demanded immediate rate cuts, claiming high interest rates were stifling growth. While central banks traditionally steer clear of political interference, Trump‚Äôs blunt remarks underscored his ongoing tension with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who might need a thicker skin for round two of Trump‚Äôs presidency.

**Tariff Talk: Allies Beware**  
  
European regulators didn‚Äôt escape Trump‚Äôs crosshairs either. He threatened new tariffs on foreign goods, pitching it as a way to funnel ‚Äúhundreds of billions‚Äù into U.S. coffers. His message to global businesses? ‚ÄúMake it in America or pay the price.‚Äù While allies bristled, Trump‚Äôs rhetoric resonated with those eager for a manufacturing revival.

**Big Picture: Bold Claims, Big Stakes**  
  
Trump painted an ambitious vision for the U.S. as a manufacturing superpower, AI hub, and energy giant. But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.

But with tariffs, sanctions, and sweeping policy changes on the table, global leaders face a choice: adapt to Trump‚Äôs economic playbook or brace for impact. For now, markets‚Äîand world leaders‚Äîare left wondering what‚Äôs next in Trump‚Äôs unfiltered economic strategy.


# On The Horizon

Tomorrow

The weekend‚Äôs in sight, but there‚Äôs still a bit more to chew on before you call it a wrap. Real estate checks in with existing home sales, while flash readings will offer a peek at the state of the services and manufacturing industries.

Earnings-wise, things are winding down. Verizon ($VZ), American Express ($AXP), and NextEra Energy ($NEE) are on deck to report tomorrow morning."

My coinbase balance on monarch money dropped a massive amount suddenly. Fortunately it is correct when I logged into Coinbase.

Has anyone else seen this issue? Did something happen with the api they use to connect?"
