Traffic due to Political gathering.,Chennai,1i9smpd,2025-01-25 12:53:18,16,0.91,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1i9smpd/traffic_due_to_political_gathering/,Lone_Wolf_Better,Rant,"Dk why political parties do this at the expense of the public. Normal aave traffic aagum Tambaram Road conditions and Traffic congestion all. But today's gathering in Pallavapuram is next level because they organised it in a road, literally, not even a ground with entrances but a connecting main road to Airport and Kundrathur there are many small businesses, a park nearby, a small temple, and whole ass school campus in the road they organised. This was all disrupted for three days because this gathering happened. When I was going to pick up my wife from the school there this morning, I saw DMK goons checking bags of passerbys Idk why since they were just passing through the roads mot even attending. Police blocked like 7-8 streets connecting from the roads for this. It was traffic hell since it took near an 45 mins to an hour to exit 5 streets from there. 7-8 connecting roads, the income lost for the businesses because they were shut for the event, traffic everywhere in the roads 2 km radius, a school street and church road blocked in 3-4 entrances for 3 days so people walking have to go around a kilmeter to get to their place, government buses changing a few boarding points all for a political gathering which was meaningless (just a chumma meeting). Why? Is there no grounds available near to organize? Why it should be on a literal street? Makes no sense, who are tthe organizers thinnking like this?

Are real estate prices too high that no ground or hall is viable budget-wise to organize a gathering so they organized it in a literal street since it was government property anyway?

TLDR: DMK set up a stage on one end of a street, filled up which chairs till other end, organized a meaningless gathering, disrupted city operations and traffic for 3 days."

Inevitable Intervention,Livimmune,1i9kgc7,2025-01-25 05:47:41,34,0.94,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i9kgc7/inevitable_intervention/,MGK_2,,"Pretty exciting times of late, wouldn't you say?

Folks, the idea that I'm putting out post after post should point to the fact that we are nearing a time that shall be marked by Intervention.  We've spoken about this before, and now speak again to this Inevitable Alignment.  This is all speculation, but it is how I'm seeing it.

u/Biostocktraderbyday explains the [addendum to the prospectus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i8yzf5/allocation_of_unrestricted_preferred_stock_and/) in this great post and comment section.  Many good points are brought up and also, questions are made and answered.  He offers explanation as to the discrepancy of the data displayed by the stock brokers.  He feels an official announcement should be due out by Wednesday.  The next couple of days, shall come the official statement.

If we are right, and I say ""we"" because, [I am in agreement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i8uf7q/evolving_course/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with him; that another entity now owns about 20% of CytoDyn.  Well, that certainly is a big deal.  20% ownership by an Institution.  That ownership gives that Institution significant power within CytoDyn and therefore, that could be a large pill to swallow for the company, for the company management and for the shareholders and investors, unless of course, that pill is very much on board with everything the company is poised at putting their hands into.

The question of whether this deal needs to be agreed/voted upon was brought up.  Seems that since the deal was done with the use of Preferred Shares and not Common Shares, that nuance allowed the deal to be done without a shareholder vote.  Again, this seems to be a massive purchase of Preferred Stock, at a very reduced rate which gives the Institutional Buyer a near 20% stake in the company.

What does CytoDyn receive in return for their allowance of this Institutional Buyer to purchase and own such a great a stake for so low a price?  I mean, some of CytoDyn's greatest investors don't even get such a sweet deal.  Take David Welch who owns very close to 5% of the company had some very sweet deals dolled out for him, but he also helped out the company in some very necessary and specialized ways, like putting up the $6.5 million bond in the Amarex Arbitration.  He may have even brought the great Sidley Austin law firm to CytoDyn.  Another amazing investor is our very own u/Amazing_Natural3735, who has invested at a rate close to 10% of Welch, which tells you [he owns about 0.5% of the company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i8yzf5/comment/m8y6qlp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), probably over 5 million shares, but certainly, neither Welch, nor Amazing are sitting nearly as sweetly as this new Institutional Investor who buys in at less than $0.15 of over 250,000,000 Preferred Shares.

So the incentive for CytoDyn to provide these Preferred Shares must be extremely beneficial to the company, wouldn't you say?  So what made Lalezari to sign this deal?  Is it the promise of what this Institutional Investor would offer that allowed him to accept this deal?  Does the deal allow for CytoDyn to move forward in their objectives more smoothly, allowing for the removal of obstacles from their path?  Does it get CytoDyn's enemies clear out of the way?  Does it somehow permit other partnerships and licensures to be hatched, formed, realized and brought to fruition?  Does it add more credibility to CytoDyn's name?

CytoDyn settled with Amarex, but much was lost through that CRO.  But it wasn't just the CRO.  Amarex was a setup for CytoDyn; a con.  It was [absolute sabotage](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/ybm823/battlelines_drawn/).  They were a proxy for CytoDyn's enemy.  Maybe this new Institutional Investor knows the truth behind this sabotage.  Maybe they have a means that can prevent any further sabotage to the company.  I discussed something like this entity when I discussed who I named the ""[Enforcer](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/x5tdmt/possibly_closer_than_most_would_think_to_a_major/)"".  Essentially, the Enforcer is an entity that would protect CytoDyn from [internal parasites](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/13nuxbr/shall_we_dance/).  It enforces and upholds the notion of Walls, Bars and Gates.  Walls keep CytoDyn's enemies out.  Bars keep at bay large interference, resistance and opposition of CytoDyn's plans.  Gates ensure that CytoDyn's management does not become corrupted.  I suggested in this Speculative 2.5 year old [Enforcer link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/x5tdmt/possibly_closer_than_most_would_think_to_a_major/) that the entity could be Sidley Austin.

[Sidley Austin](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeronLimab_Times/comments/yoj0y1/2_individuals_shrouded_in_mystery/) came out of nowhere.  They helped CytoDyn overcome Amarex when CytoDyn won the [Amarex Arbitration](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/622/cytodyn-announces-settlement-with-amarex-clinical-research).  One and one half years later, CytoDyn moves from Phase 1 to Phase 2.  Some Institutional Investor owns 20% CytoDyn and that Investor must possess some massive benefit to CytoDyn.  All of us know [how important our Patents are](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1fxp22n/momentum_and_then_suddenly/).  Tyler [Blok has made everyone know](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1eoqbcq/met_milestones/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that these [Patents are what holds the company together](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1bsa6lh/separating_wheat_from_tares/) currently and into the coming decades.  We have speculated as to why Blok may have received a premature promotion in [New Beginnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1gdxlne/new_beginnings/).  Blok was appointed by the Board as [Chief Legal Officer effective September 27, 2024](https://www.cytodyn.com/our-team/leadership-team), but nobody seems to know why just yet.  Seems to me, that if CytoDyn is to become a nucleus centrality in the distribution of Livimmune licenses for the multiplied and varied use of leronlimab in the treatment of a whole slew of inflammatory disease entities which are ever growing in number, then CytoDyn requires its own legal department in handling the unending details of all those licenses and partnerships.  Maybe rather than hire a legal department for the purpose, maybe it might just be better to allow one experienced and well known law firm to come in by buying in on the cheap a whole bunch of shares and allowing that Institution Investor Attorney to provide legal services also on the cheap, all the while allowing them to benefit from the increasing share price with their purchased hundreds of millions of shares.

No doubt, CytoDyn requires this protection by an internal attorney.  Tyler now serves that role, but soon, he shall require a great, great deal of assistance.  Legal fees are expensive.  So, this is a viable possibility.

Phase 2.  G wants us to exit the scene, but [CytoDyn ain't going anywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i9742a/listen_to_j_sacha_present_the_hiv_triple_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  Thank you so much u/BuildGoodThings!  What an incredible find.  [HIV Cure is CytoDyn's playing field](https://investorshangout.com/post/view?id=6741313).  So, CytoDyn remains in the game and certainly is not leaving the HIV Cure indication.  Could an internal attorney also help to protect CytoDyn from market manipulation?  Are threats of law suits a viable possibility when there exists absolute evidence of short attacks at opportune and strategic moments of attack?  Could CytoDyn be telling its enemies, you better get ready to start defending your prior manipulative actions, because what you have already done was illegal, so prepare to defend yourself.  In addition, you better start to pull back, or else you certainly shall have a fire breathing dragon up your ass for whatever remains of you.  No, CytoDyn is not retreating, rather, they're on the offensive.

Some Institutional Investor bought up 20% CytoDyn, and the details are soon to be revealed.  This is all but speculation helping me to bring out questions as to why and with who, for what benefit, to meet what need.  G has been a formidable foe from day 1.  They have used crafty counsel for so very long.  Maybe, the time has come for CytoDyn to return the favor.

CytoDyn has to be ""up to here"" with everything G has done to it over the years.  Enough is enough and the time has come to fight back.  G is not stupid.  Hardly.  They are masterful at their cunningly ways.  But CytoDyn has a mission and they are hell bent on keeping that mission, by hell or high water.  If the Institutional Investor is Sidley Austin, does that cause G to drop their tail between their legs?  Do they then piss their pants and scamper away?  Do they then begin to comply with CytoDyn's requests and demands and begin paying CytoDyn some respect?

Really, what more does G have to fight with?  An every 6 month PrEP for HIV?  How do you compete with a one treatment HIV Cure that uses either [AAV vector technology](https://investorshangout.com/post/view?id=6741313) or [bNAbs + leronlimab](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i9742a/listen_to_j_sacha_present_the_hiv_triple_therapy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)?  To me, CytoDyn has a great upper cut in this fight.  There shall be no negotiation with G after everything they have done.  Their crafty counsel has met their match.  Their techniques have been gut wrenchingly low ball punches for all of CytoDyn's shareholders to bear, and they have not ceased in their pummeling resistance.  Their absolute aim was the utter obliteration of the molecule and of the company, no question about it.  Maybe they better get used to the sights of the blank walls of the inside of a court room.

This is how I see it happening because I don't believe any truce could legitimately be made with G.  They have too much to lose and CytoDyn is not giving up on the cure.  There shall be no truce, no, not with Max on board.  Not with Gates on board and nor with Trump on board.  No, HIV shall be cured and there won't be any stopping that.  So, G won't let this happen without a damn fight.  CytoDyn needs its share of attorneys who are specialists in the matters.  Doesn't Sidley Austin already have tremendous experience in leronlimab, in Amarex and in G?

u/Biostocktraderbyday says by Wednesday, 1/29/25, we should know more.

Events being placed into realistic possibilities all leading to the proper resolution of the situation at hand.  Days away from knowing.  Enough said.

Superstars come with the problem of matching salary, but some high value contracts can be had for some draft picks and the consolidation of a few bench players.

So who ranks at the top on AAV contracts?

Obviously rookie contracts like Wemby and Paolo will be high. But other like Herb Jones have the whole league waiting for NOLA to say the word. Far more appealing than either Zion or Ingram, which would probably be surprising just a few years ago. Right now part of Cam Johnson’s appeal is that his production over performing his contract.

While the market cap currently stands at $1.77 billion, S$ has finally shown some positive price action, breaking out of its downward trend. This recovery is largely driven by retail traders reinvesting into S$ following its widespread CEX listings. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the price will immediately skyrocket, but it’s clear that retail interest is returning.

The Sonic ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, with Chainlink already deployed and AAVE set to launch soon.

Although altcoins are still bleeding against BTC, we believe S$ is well-positioned for the next alt season. That said, BTC dominance remains strong.

Did the Covid vaccine play a role in activating my predisposition to AS?,ankylosingspondylitis,1i9124r,2025-01-24 12:37:48,0,0.43,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankylosingspondylitis/comments/1i9124r/did_the_covid_vaccine_play_a_role_in_activating/,livinglyf3,,"This post is not meant to stir controversy, im just genuinely curious if others have a similar timeline and what yoy think.

A few days ago I was thinking about the timeline of when I had my first flare and when I got the Covid vaccine - they were about 2 months apart. I am wondering if Covid could have triggered the disease. Like maybe my body had a pre-disposition to it and the vaccine pushed it on. I found research on Covid and autoimmune diseases but this is one of the only ones I found on AS specifically. 

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25785826.2024.2339542

Excerpt: 

The adjuvant activity of the vaccine activates innate immune sensors, resulting in the production of type I interferon and multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, which activate T cells and induce immunity against SARS-CoV-2. 

Increased production of type I interferon and multiple pro-inflammatory mediators following vaccination may trigger the onset or exacerbation of existing pre-autoimmune conditions and develop autoimmune diseases such as RA, AAV or SLE. In most of reported cases in Tables 1–3, the duration of vaccination and onset of the diseases is relatively short, that is, within a month, suggesting that the stimulation of existing pre-autoimmune conditions considered to be the main pathogenic factor.

Among autoimmune diseases, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, polymyalgia rheumatica and thyroiditis were significantly more frequently reported to occur following COVID-19 vaccines than following all other vaccines."

Differdange International School ranked as the worst in all of Europe,Luxembourg,1i8z379,2025-01-24 11:16:24,70,0.8,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Luxembourg/comments/1i8z379/differdange_international_school_ranked_as_the/,argrejarg,News,"[Differdange International School ranked bottom in Europe | Luxembourg Times](https://www.luxtimes.lu/luxembourg/differdange-international-school-ranked-bottom-in-europe/35832666.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawIAmxVleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHXRbAr7OegfzuEg05_P2lQ5MnX4Q1ANN4ezEvbHmttZZrgfobWI6XyX8XQ_aem_OfqApvAavQz_ve6s9uIs5w#Echobox=1737720898)

The area (100m from the steel plant in Differdange) has a big lead pollution problem, and other pollutants too, it was very unwise to build a school there. Arcelor are now promising to reduce the pollution by 80% (they had more friends in the previous government and were not obliged to do anything until the recent elections). I wonder if the Bacc scores will improve?

EDIT: I have seen a lot responses saying versions of (1) It is not the school, it is the children they are inferior in some way (poor, foreign, at least nobody mentions that some are not white). (2) Lead doesn't alter test scores (3) Where are the receipts for the money paid to the previous deputy prime minister by Arcelor Mittal (4) What else is wrong with EID?  OK:

(1) About half of the kids are children of immigrants, mostly they come from countries with higher typical literacy and numeracy at age 11 than Luxembourg has. The attitude of the school and the government might be connected to their race or origin, but the kids themselves arrive with extremely high potential.

(2) Of course lead and other heavy metals are neurotoxic everybody knows this. Here is a US study where they measured the increase in academic performance following removal of a source of airborne  lead pollution that had been tolerated for a long time: [A Thousand Cuts: Cumulative Lead Exposure Reduces Academic Achievement](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28250/w28250.pdf)  Here is the documentation from AEV showing airborne lead and other heavy metals, mercury, cadmium etc exactly at the location of EID: [https://environnement.public.lu/fr/loft/air/mesures/publications-periodiques.html](https://environnement.public.lu/fr/loft/air/mesures/publications-periodiques.html) 

(3) Etienne Schneider (former deputy prime minister) was also a director of Arcelor Mittal, that is a huge conflict of interest and clearly explains the huge flux of Luxembourgish government money into a foreign-owned and highly polluting company, and the lack of oversight of that company.  The timing of the attempts at environmental amelioration, to coincide with a change of government, well I can't prove it but it looks like they would not have done this if they had nost lost some of their protection following the removal of DP as senior coalition partners. [ArcelorMittal implements new noise and environmental measures | Delano News](https://delano.lu/article/arcelormittal-implements-new-n) 

(4) What else is wrong with EID (OK nobody asked this)... plenty. I tried everything to raise standards in a firendly way before giving up and taking my kids out of there. The rock-bottom worst-in-Europe test scores are not the worst thing about the school at all it is the attitude of the management, and the attitude of the ministry that they should protect incompetent civil servants at any cost, but have no responsibility to the children.

[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw2900](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw2900)

I am trying to do similar experiment as above paper.

They did alkaline lysis (miniprep) to isolate viral DNA.

So, I prepped brain section, homogenized it with a plastic pestle and did miniprep.

However, the final product seems to have very low amount of viral DNA.

I am thinking of optimizing homogenization step, which I think I did very poorly (has a lot of not small debris) and maybe try commercial DNA purification kit in conjunction with PCR purification kit to remove gDNA.

Does anyone have similar experience or suggestions as to how I proceed from here?

Thank you!"

Thanks for writing, and for your interest in our work.

Yes, the community has been very helpful. Just speaking out about the virus, and the need for better therapies and cure is making a big difference in how the work is viewed by NIH and other funders.

For our work, we use a disabled harmless virus (AAV) to deliver molecular scissors (known as meganucleases) to the nerve cells where HSV lies dormant. The scissors cut up the HSV and allow the body to degrade it. Once it’s gone, it can’t cause future recurrences. We are working on both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and it seems to be effective for both - experiments are ongoing.

So we are definitely eager to start human trials, but we are still working through the regulatory process, so it’s going to be a while yet (couple of years?) until we can test our therapy in people. So we’re not ready to sign anybody up yet. 

I’m connecting you with Andrea Larson (hsv@fredhutch.org), who can give you some information about how to stay connected and involved as our work continues. You might have seen them, but we recently did a couple of video updates that you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8CjVT7T1fE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2SvZFYlI0o. And our newest data was just published here https://rdcu.be/dHMrZ (warning - technical!).

In the meantime, you can find other studies at clinicaltrials.gov

Please stay tuned and hopeful! We’re determined, and working as fast as we can.

I’m at a loss for what to do,labrats,1i8dztk,2025-01-23 16:04:29,13,0.84,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1i8dztk/im_at_a_loss_for_what_to_do/,Informal-Barber-3623,,"Rant incoming - In December of 2023 I graduated with a degree in computational biology and I have been working full time as a research tech for almost two years now (switched majors and had one extra class to take in the fall of 2023 so really I graduated in April of 2023 but anyways). My primary research has been in AAV gene therapy(been in the same lab since late 2020) and I’ve worked on wet/dry/behavioral projects and I’m first authoring a paper right now. However, none of my work has intimately focused on what I want to pursue. I started out wanting to go into medical school for ophthalmology but fell in love with research and then even more so with structural biology in regard to protein design and modeling/computer aided drug design. (To me it’s one of those things that you just find and you know that’s all you ever want to do and if you’re not working in that field you’ll be unsatisfied for the rest of your life) But I stayed with my lab because I was learning a bunch and by the time I realized what I wanted to do I was already handling my own projects so I wanted to get the first and second authorships out of it and I enjoyed my coworkers so I really didn’t mind. But now I’m stuck, I want to get my PhD and fully transition into this computational/structural biology field but I feel as though my lack of experience has been hindering me. I’ve gone through two cycles now of constant rejections from graduate programs and I don’t know what to do(I know persistence is key but I want to be growing more between each cycle to make my application stronger and stronger).

And now I feel completely beat down, hopeless and anxious for the future. With Trump freezing NIH activity I fear that I’m going to be pushed out of research. I’m trying to find a new position where I can grow the skills I want to learn but so far I’ve been running into the fact that people don’t have funding to take me on and all the jobs that are in the private sector or government sector all require some form of graduate degree. It feels like I’m stuck in an odd catch 22 situation where I need experience to get a graduate degree but to get any experience you need a graduate degree. With the NIH activity freeze I feel it will worsen any chance for me to get experience in an academic lab as PIs will shrink/stagnate their lab size to stay afloat and not take on a new researcher. Now I feel like I’ll never end up getting into a graduate program let alone find a job in a research field to support me, I barely make enough as is right now to support myself and I’m finding that all the jobs I would even consider applying for in my city (or others) will pay me less than what I make now. I’m trying to stay positive and I’ve been emailing any and all labs related to the research I want to do but I haven’t had luck and I’m starting to lose hope are there any young scientists (or any in general) feeling this way too? 

TL;DR - I want to stay in research but I am struggling to find a path forward in it to support myself"

Before 2024, his estimated contract value was about 500M+, but we know with hindsight that 500M+ is a steal and a half. My question is, when all is said and done with his Dodger's career, how much value do you guys think Shohei would bring to this team? Both on-field and off-field contributions."

So I'm a very talkative person and I love talking to people and getting their insight on different things, but it seems like no matter how much I talk to them or how much fun we have, I can never get past the surface. I don't know if my energy is off-putting because I'm a very hyper and friendly person, but it just seems like I have no friends, only acquaintances! 

I only have one close friend who I've been friends with for around three years, and I'm getting closer to this other girl, but it seems like for everyone else, it's just dumb small talk. 

I'm not sure if my perception of friendships are skewed and that we don't need to talk about deep stuff to actually be friends, but it seems like after a while of small talk, a lot of my convos just start to fizzle. I want to get to know a person deeper than their very obvious likes a dislikes, so I'd really appreciate advice on how to get to know a person on a deeper level!

An example of this is when I wa talking to this girl, and our convos only revolve around talking about other people. We don't really talk bad about them, but we talk about things they've done and the facts we know. I don't really like this because I'm not into talking to people behind their backs, but I just let it happen because I really want to be friends with this girl since she's the only other ""ghetto"" person here (I go to a fancy school with a bunch of posh kids and i have noticed that when I'm talking to her, I seem to use more AAVE and slang because she's the only other person who talk like that). Once we finished talking about her ex, we started to get really quiet. To try and start a convo again, I told her that we were acting really awkward, and that maybe we should play twenty questions to get to know each other better. I said this in a joking matter because I didn't want to just get randomly serious with her, and she brushed it off and we just started talking about another person or how our lives are so similar. I feel like this is a good step in the next direction, but the only thing I really know about her other than her race and some of her experiences as someone who has lives in a poorer town (like me) is that she likes volleyball. I want to get to know her better but don't know how. If anyone could help me that would be greatly appreciated!"

"Trump Family May Use Ethereum For New Business Ventures, Says ConsenSys CEO",Blockviews,1i8bx6g,2025-01-23 14:37:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i8bx6g/trump_family_may_use_ethereum_for_new_business/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Is the Trump Family Eyeing Ethereum for Major Business Ventures?  

The buzz around $ETH just got a lot louder with an interesting twist—ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin hinted that the Trump family might launch giant businesses on the Ethereum blockchain. In an X post, Lubin suggested that not only is the Trump Administration exploring ways the US can support $ETH, but Ethereum could potentially become the backbone for future government activities, much like internet protocols today.

While you process that bold possibility, here's another major reveal: Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial has ramped up its $ETH holdings. According to Etherscan, the wallet is now sitting on a whopping 55,719 $ETH—valued at around $183 million. Besides $ETH, the wallet also holds tokens like $AAVE and $LINK, further indicating their deepening crypto involvement.

Crypto analysts are now debating whether this could be the catalyst for the next Ethereum rally. With $ETH trading in the low $3,000 range, chart patterns like bullish head-and-shoulders and ascending triangles are signaling potential breakouts. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe believe 2025 could be a defining year for Ethereum, with long-term price targets reaching as high as $10,000.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Some whales are skeptical, and short-term $ETH price stagnation has them on edge. However, with power moves like World Liberty Financial’s, Ethereum might just be priming itself for an epic comeback.

Trump’s World Liberty Financial To Buy More TRX This Week,draqai,1i88mi7,2025-01-23 12:23:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i88mi7/trumps_world_liberty_financial_to_buy_more_trx/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Trump’s World Liberty Financial Goes Big on $TRX… Again! 🤑  

Crypto world, brace yourselves! World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance project tied to none other than Donald Trump, is once again making waves. After a jaw-dropping $2.6M purchase of $TRX just days ago, WLF is now ready to scoop up an additional $2.65M worth this week.  

And that’s not all, honey! Their already loaded treasury boasts a delish $352M in crypto assets, including $ETH, $WBTC, staked $ETH, and of course, $TRX. WLF clearly knows how to keep its bags bougie.  

If you think this started small, think again. The project threw a financial party on Trump’s Inauguration Day, stacking $112.8M of crypto in one flirty move, with a spread that included $47M in $ETH and $4.7M each of AAVE, LINK, TRX, and ENA. Talk about goals. 😏  

But hold up, the WLFI token sale isn’t over yet! Only 2.4 billion tokens are left out of a spicy 25 billion total, and since its September launch, a sizzling $1.1B has already been raised.  

Btw, it’s not just WLF making plays. $TRON founder Justin Sun is all smiles, having earlier snatched up $30M worth of WLFI tokens. With the new US administration bro-ing out with crypto, seems like 2024 might just be the year to pop champagne for decentralized coins. 🍾  

Who's vibing with this pro-crypto energy? Drop your thoughts and let’s get this blockchain convo lit.

Anyone knows why monthly mortgage is not included in the Household Expenditure Survey?,askSingapore,1i80tam,2025-01-23 05:55:34,2,0.63,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1i80tam/anyone_knows_why_monthly_mortgage_is_not_included/,Lapsus-Stella,General,"The Department of Statistics just released the latest [2023 Report on the Household Expenditure Survey](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/households/hes2023.ashx) in November last year.

I was reading through the report and it says -

>The consumption expenditure on owner-occupied accommodation is estimated using the rental equivalence method, which measures the shelter cost in terms of the expected rental the owner would have to pay if he were a tenant of the premises. It is estimated based on the Annual Assessed Values (AAVs) provided by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). **Monthly mortgage repayments are not included in the consumption expenditure on owner-occupied accommodation.**

Any idea why they do not just ask the household on mortgage expense, since they are collecting the numbers on everything else? Given that mortgage expense is likely the BIGGEST expense for most households, that seem to be missing the point of getting an accurate picture of household expenditure across different groups.

I think I too stupid. Can someone enlighten me please?"
Almost There,Livimmune,1i7zey2,2025-01-23 04:09:38,58,0.97,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1i7zey2/almost_there/,MGK_2,,"Almost There, Aren't We?  This post really is meant to bring new investors up to speed as to the various avenues of interest that CytoDyn is currently pursuing.

All of that which we expect as CYDY shareholders is simply that which leronlimab is capable of, and we hope and believe that those laboring souls at CytoDyn do their absolute best to make each of these expectations a reality.  The feeling of positivity emanates as many of us are expecting good news in the proximal future.

We are aware that there are plenty of temporary treatments out there for HIV, but there are zero cures.  Those treatments work for a certain period of time, but if you stop or fail to take the next dose, HIV returns back to the body and would lead to AIDS unless the medication is taken again.  That is because the medications are not a cure.  There is a massive interest to insure that the disease itself doesn't go away, that HIV is never cured.  If HIV is cured, then tens to hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost in recurrent annual revenue, therefore, there is immense pressure to insure that HIV doesn't go anywhere.  Treatments for the disease do abound, but there exists not one cure.

CytoDyn however, is the one and only company actually working towards and getting extremely close to establishing a viable cure for HIV.

[Jonah Sacha, Ph.D](https://www.cytodyn.com/our-team/scientific-advisory-board)., who is a professor at OHSU's Oregon National Primate Research Center, and who also sits on CytoDyn's Scientific Advisory Board, is currently working on several projects aimed at curing HIV:

* [Reverse-engineering stem cell transplant cure](https://ohsufoundation.org/stories/the-changemakers-jonah-sacha/): Sacha studies the molecular mechanisms and immune responses behind the [five known cases of HIV cure](https://news.ohsu.edu/2023/05/25/ohsu-research-offers-clues-for-potential-widespread-hiv-cure-in-people) via stem cell transplant. This research aims to develop HIV-specific immunotherapies that could lead to a widespread cure.
* Gene therapy using leronlimab: Sacha leads a preclinical study funded by a $5 million NIH grant to develop a single-injection gene therapy based on leronlimab. This approach aims to provide a ""[functional cure](https://www.biospace.com/cytodyn-highlights-nih-grant-for-hiv-functional-cure-preclinical-study-of-gene-therapy-based-on-leronlimab)"" for HIV, allowing sustained viral suppression without lifelong medication.
* Nonhuman primate studies: [Sacha has successfully cured two nonhuman primates](https://news.ohsu.edu/2023/05/25/ohsu-research-offers-clues-for-potential-widespread-hiv-cure-in-people) of the monkey form of HIV using stem cell transplants. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of HIV cure and informs efforts to make the cure applicable to more people.
* AAV vector-based gene therapy: Sacha is involved in [research to develop novel AAV vectors](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/MqjH24xtlU-kksVHn44bKw/project-details/10371617) for gene therapy to cure HIV. This work aims to establish long-term antibody-based competitive CCR5 inhibition as a potential cure mechanism.
* Sacha is involved in a study investigating the transplacental transfer of leronlimab. The study aims to test the hypothesis that [FcRn-enhancing mutations can lead to increased and prolonged levels of antibodies crossing the placenta](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11441024/).  This research is part of Sacha's broader work on developing HIV cures and treatments. While not explicitly stated as an HIV cure, this study explores a potential method for preventing HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy. The use of LS mutations (likely referring to FcRn-enhancing mutations) is being investigated to improve the efficacy of leronlimab in crossing the placental barrier.
* Sacha is involved in a groundbreaking [study that combines early antiretroviral therapy (ART) with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and leronlimab](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/628/cytodyn-announces-abstract-that-highlights-leronlimabs) to potentially achieve sustained viral control in HIV infection. This study was [presented at the 5th annual HIV Research for Prevention Conference in October 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/07/2959100/19782/en/CytoDyn-Announces-Abstract-that-Highlights-Leronlimab-s-Potential-in-Mediating-ART-Free-Viral-Control-in-Infant-Rhesus-Macaques.html).  Key aspects of the study include:
   1. Objective: To assess whether the combination of early ART initiation with bNAbs and leronlimab could provide sustained viral control in infant rhesus macaques, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for lifelong daily medication.  This research represents a significant step forward in the quest for an HIV cure, combining multiple therapeutic approaches to achieve sustained viral control [without the need for continuous ART](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jia2.26351).
   2. Methodology: Eighteen infant rhesus macaques were infected with Simian Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) and then treated with various combinations of ART, bNAbs, and leronlimab. The study evaluated the efficacy of these treatments over a 27-week period, followed by a treatment interruption to monitor virus rebound.
   3. Results: The combination of ART, bNAbs, and leronlimab showed promising outcomes, with no virus rebound observed in any of the treated animals. This suggests a potential for durable viral control and a significant advancement towards minimizing or eliminating the need for ongoing ART.
   4. Significance: Dr. Sacha noted that the results demonstrate a previously unappreciated synergy between CCR5 blockade (via leronlimab) and antibody neutralization, opening the door to a new approach for an HIV cure.
   5. Collaboration: The study was funded by an NIH grant awarded to Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and led by Dr. Nancy Haigwood, Dr. Sacha, and their collaborators.

Together, these projects collectively represent a multi-faceted approach to developing an HIV cure, ranging from basic science to translational research and clinical applications.  Their efforts towards this end are proving successful as they now have multiple monkeys with eradicated SHIV vius and not taking ART therapy in excess of 1 year.

During his first term as president, [Donald Trump launched a program aimed at ending the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/13/trump-hiv-republicans-prep-00126468). This initiative, called ""Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America"" (EHE), [was announced in 2019](https://www.kff.org/report-section/president-trumps-record-on-health-care-issue-brief/).  The EHE plan had [four main pillars](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6893357/): diagnose, treat, prevent, and respond.  It focused on providing additional resources and funding to [areas most affected by HIV](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-america-first-healthcare-plan/), including 48 counties, Washington D.C., San Juan, Puerto Rico, and seven states with high rural HIV rates.  Key aspects of Trump's HIV/AIDS program included:

1. [Increased funding](https://www.hiv.gov/blog/trump-administration-awards-1-million-ryan-white-hivaids-program-grants-counties-strengthen): The administration awarded grants to strengthen efforts in combating HIV, including $1 million in Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grants.
2. Focus on prevention: The plan promoted expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and secured a donation of HIV preventive medication for eligible patients.
3. Global efforts: Trump continued support for PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), signing the [PEPFAR Extension Act in 2018](https://2017-2021.state.gov/on-president-trump-signing-pepfar-extension-act-of-2018/).

While the program aimed to end the HIV epidemic rather than specifically ""cure"" AIDS, it represented a significant commitment to addressing HIV/AIDS in the United States.  COVID came along in 2020 and put a real damper on this initiative, but the plan remains underway.  

As of late, [Bill Gates recently had a three-hour dinner meeting with President Donald Trump](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/what-bill-gates-and-donald-trump-discussed-during-3-hour-dinner-7500803), during which they discussed several global health issues, including efforts to develop a cure for HIV.  Gates shared that he spoke extensively about HIV and the work his foundation is doing to find a cure. He emphasized that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is ""[literally working on a cure for that](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/bill-gates-spills-the-beans-on-intriguing-3-hour-dinner-chat-with-trump-i-was-impressed-101737158779211.html),"" although they are still in the early stages of this research.  During their conversation, Gates drew a parallel between the accelerated vaccine development during the COVID-19 pandemic under Trump's administration and the potential for similar progress in HIV research.   He asked Trump if a similar approach could be applied to HIV cure efforts, stating, ""So I was asking him if maybe the same kind of thing could be done here"".  Gates reported that both he and Trump became excited about the possibility of accelerating HIV cure research.  He noted that Trump showed genuine interest in the topics discussed and [appeared energized about driving innovation in this area](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-gates-reveals-what-discussed-with-trump-during-recent-private-meeting_n_678ab46ae4b0eb656c9b060e).  The Microsoft co-founder expressed that he was ""frankly impressed"" with how well Trump demonstrated interest in the issues he brought up, including the [potential for advancing HIV cure research](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5092973-bill-gates-donald-trump-meeting/).

Given that Max Lataillade, SVP is simultaneously the [Head of Clinical Development at CytoDyn](https://www.cytodyn.com/our-team/leadership-team) while also the [Head of HIV Drug Development at the Gate's Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlataillade/), it is also given that Max had likely informed Bill of all the accomplishments Jonah Sacha, PhD has achieved in regards to an HIV cure.  My understanding would permit me to believe that Gate's understanding from Max allowed him to communicate to Trump that an HIV cure utilizing leronlimab could become an FDA approved reality by \~early-mid of 2027 provided proper funding is obtained now.  If the proper amount of investment and provisions were made, such a possibility would then place Trump's HIV-2030 plan way ahead of schedule.  Trump was more than responsive.

So, this could have been the topic of this 3-hour long discussion that has taken place, and I suspect that we can expect more like it.  What might be the fruit of these discussions?  A collaboration between CytoDyn, the Gate's Foundation and the Federal Government for an HIV cure that could be approved by mid-2027.  That is 30 months from now.

//LATCH

In HIV, CytoDyn is also advancing its LATCH (Leronlimab in Allogenic stem cell Transplant to Cure HIV) program, which aims to use leronlimab in an innovative approach to potentially cure HIV. The company has two notable developments in this area:

1. Primary [LATCH Study](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CYDY/september-2024-letter-to-xj0p5dt2m6xf.html):  CytoDyn is partnering with the American Foundation for AIDS Research [(amfAR) to sponsor the main LATCH study](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/633/december-2024-letter-to-shareholders).  This trial will:
   1. Use leronlimab to protect CCR5+ donor immune cells from HIV infection
   2. Aim for a HIV cure in the setting of bone marrow transplant to an HIV positive recipient
   3. Complete final protocol updates were completed by the end of December 2024
   4. Launch in 2025
2. Berlin LATCH Study:  Following a successful HIV cure announcement by German investigators using donor cells heterozygous for the CCR5-delta 32 mutation, CytoDyn has been approached to expand the LATCH program:
   1. The same German investigators have requested to run a similar LATCH study at their research center in Berlin
   2. CytoDyn is makeing this opportunity a reality

The company is optimistic about the LATCH program's potential success, given the recent breakthrough in Germany. This dual-track approach with studies in multiple locations could accelerate research and potentially lead to groundbreaking advancements in HIV cure strategies.

What else does CytoDyn have going on?

//MSS mCRC

The [MSS mCRC clinical trial](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/04/2974079/19782/en/CytoDyn-Announces-FDA-Clearance-of-Its-Phase-II-Oncology-Trial.html) has begun.  This trial is the only clinical trial that CytoDyn is actually currently funding, the remainder are being sponsored by 3rd parties.  [CytoDyn's Phase II clinical trial for leronlimab in colorectal cancer](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/631/cytodyn-announces-fda-clearance-of-its-phase-ii-oncology) has begun patient enrollment in January, 2025.  The company has received FDA clearance for the trial, which evaluates the [efficacy of leronlimab in patients with relapsed/refractory microsatellite stable colorectal cancer](https://thelansis.com/newsletter/fda-clears-cytodyns-leronlimab-for-phase-ii-trial-in-colorectal-cancer/).  A [trial kickoff meeting](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/oct/04/vancouver-based-cytodyn-on-the-verge-of-leronlimab-cancer-trial/) was completed late November 2024, and [patient screening is expected to start in early 2025](https://informaconnect.com/cytodyn-hires-syneos-for-second-leronlimab-trial/).  The trial is conducted in partnership with Syneos Health, which CytoDyn has engaged as the contract research organization (CRO) for this study. This Phase II oncology trial represents an important step for CytoDyn in advancing leronlimab's potential as a treatment for colorectal cancer, with the company's CEO emphasizing that investigating leronlimab in oncology remains their top priority.

//MASH

CytoDyn has probably already received the [MASH murine results of its second confirmatory MASH murine study](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cytodyn-appoints-dr-melissa-palmer-m-d-as-lead-consultant-in-hepatology-announces-follow-up-inflammation-studies-with-smc-laboratories).  CytoDyn has commissioned two follow-up studies [following preliminary study](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/626/cytodyn-announces-preliminary-findings-in-study-with-smc) with SMC Laboratories to confirm and extend the observation of fibrosis reversal [seen in their initial preclinical study concluded in September 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/24/2952156/19782/en/CytoDyn-Announces-Preliminary-Findings-in-Study-with-SMC-Laboratories.html).  These follow-up studies are likely complete, with [results expected in January, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/Livimmune/comments/1haopji/smc_labs_adds_cytodyn_study_to_their_news_list/).  These follow-up, confirmatory studies were initiated after promising initial results from the September 2024 study, which showed that leronlimab monotherapy (700 mg) demonstrated statistically significant fibrosis reversal compared to a control group.  One of the current studies is using the STAM mouse model again.  [Dr. Melissa Palmer](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cytodyn-appoints-dr-melissa-palmer-m-d-as-lead-consultant-in-hepatology-announces-follow-up-inflammation-studies-with-smc-laboratories), an internationally renowned hepatologist, has been appointed as the lead consultant in hepatology to oversee these follow-up studies with SMC Laboratories.  The studies compare leronlimab alone and in combination with other therapies, building on the findings from the previous research. Given the current date, it's likely that these studies are in their final stages, with results anticipated to be released soon.

//Pulmonary Fibrosis

CytoDyn's potential involvement in a pulmonary fibrosis pilot trial is contingent on the positive outcomes of their ongoing studies, particularly in the area of fibrosis reversal. While there is no direct mention of a pulmonary fibrosis trial for CytoDyn, the company's recent findings in liver fibrosis studies suggest promising applications for leronlimab in fibrotic conditions.  The preliminary results from CytoDyn's study with SMC Laboratories showed that leronlimab demonstrated significant fibrosis reversal in a liver model:

1. Leronlimab monotherapy (700 mg) showed [statistically significant fibrosis reversal](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cytodyn-announces-preliminary-findings-in-study-with-smc-laboratories) compared to a [control group (p<0.01)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/24/2952156/19782/en/CytoDyn-Announces-Preliminary-Findings-in-Study-with-SMC-Laboratories.html).
2. The drug exhibited dose-dependent antifibrotic activity, with the 700 mg dose performing better than the 350 mg dose in reversing liver fibrosis.
3. Leronlimab (700 mg) appeared to have better anti-fibrotic activity compared to Resmetirom, an approved therapy for MASH (p=0.057).

Given these encouraging results in liver fibrosis, it's plausible that CytoDyn might consider expanding their research into other fibrotic conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis. The company's CEO, Dr. Jacob Lalezari, stated that these results ""confirm our belief that leronlimab has the potential to be materially beneficial for patients suffering from a number of medical concerns"".

If CytoDyn decides to pursue a pulmonary fibrosis pilot trial, it would likely follow a similar structure to other pilot studies in this field:

1. The trial would likely be [small-scale](https://news.vumc.org/2018/02/01/study-tracks-therapy-to-slow-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/), possibly involving around 20-30 patients, [similar to other pilot studies in pulmonary fibrosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4620709/).
2. The primary endpoint might focus on changes in lung function, such as forced vital capacity (FVC), which is a common measure in pulmonary fibrosis trials.
3. Secondary endpoints could include measures like diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, 6-minute walk test distance, and quality of life assessments.

However, it's important to note that initiating a pulmonary fibrosis trial would be a significant new direction for CytoDyn, as their current focus appears to be on liver conditions like MASH, as well as other areas such as HIV, oncology, and potentially Alzheimer's disease. Any decision to expand into pulmonary fibrosis would likely depend on further positive results from their ongoing studies and strategic considerations by the company's leadership.

//GlioBlastoma Multiforme

CytoDyn has initiated a[ pre-clinical trial for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/617/cytodyn-announces-submission-of-clinical-protocol-to) in partnership with Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York.  This study, which began in December 2023, aims to evaluate the efficacy of leronlimab in treating GBM using a humanized mouse model. The trial design includes three groups of humanized mice:

1. A control group
2. A group receiving only leronlimab
3. A group receiving a combination of leronlimab and temozolomide

The primary objective of this study is to assess leronlimab's effect on primary tumor growth and the occurrence of metastases in both CCR5+ and CCR5- cells in humanized mice.  This pre-clinical trial is significant as GBM is a common and often untreatable form of primary brain cancer, and CytoDyn aims to evaluate leronlimab's potential in this challenging disease setting.  Dr. Jacob Lalezari, CEO of CytoDyn, expressed excitement about starting this pre-clinical trial, emphasizing the opportunity to evaluate leronlimab's potential effects in a pre-clinical model of this deadly cancer.

//Metastatic Breast Cancer

CytoDyn is conducting murine studies in metastatic breast cancer to evaluate the potential efficacy of leronlimab in this challenging disease. These preclinical studies are an important step in the drug development process, potentially paving the way for future clinical trials in humans. Here's an elaboration on CytoDyn's efforts in metastatic breast cancer research:

1. Preclinical investigation: The murine studies allow researchers to assess leronlimab's effects on breast cancer metastasis in a controlled laboratory setting.
2. Mechanism of action: Leronlimab, as a CCR5 antagonist, may inhibit the migration and invasion of cancer cells, potentially reducing metastasis.
3. Previous results: CytoDyn has reported promising results from earlier studies, showing that leronlimab reduced breast cancer metastasis in humanized mouse models.
4. Combination therapy potential: The murine studies may also explore leronlimab's efficacy in combination with standard breast cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
5. Biomarker identification: These studies could help identify potential biomarkers that predict response to leronlimab in breast cancer patients.
6. Dosing optimization: Murine studies allow researchers to experiment with different dosing regimens to determine the most effective approach for future clinical trials.
7. Safety profile: While leronlimab has shown a favorable safety profile in other indications, these studies will provide additional data on its safety in the context of breast cancer treatment.

If the murine studies yield positive results, CytoDyn may proceed to:

* Design and propose human clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer
* Seek regulatory approval for initiating these trials
* Potentially expand their oncology pipeline to include breast cancer as a key indication for leronlimab

These murine studies represent an important step in CytoDyn's efforts to develop leronlimab as a potential treatment for metastatic breast cancer, a disease that still has significant unmet medical needs despite recent advances in therapy.

//Alzheimer's Disease

CytoDyn has [finalized the protocol for a pilot study of leronlimab in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CYDY/december-2024-letter-to-ltow3f74tswn.html). Here are the key details of this upcoming trial:

1. Location: The study will take place at [Cornell Medical Center in New York](https://www.cytodyn.com/newsroom/press-releases/detail/633/december-2024-letter-to-shareholders).
2. Funding: The study is now fully funded by an outside foundation that wishes to remain anonymous.
3. Primary Endpoint: The trial will evaluate an objective neuroradiology primary endpoint, which will provide a clear measure of leronlimab's potential role in treating Alzheimer's disease.
4. Status: As of the current date (January 22, 2025), the protocol is set to be submitted to both the FDA and the Cornell IRB soon.
5. Significance: This study aims to assess leronlimab's efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease, focusing on its potential to [modulate inflammation and amyloid in the brain](https://www.cytodyn.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/600/cytodyn-announces-the-addition-of-leading-experts-in).

The initiation of this Alzheimer's trial represents an important step in CytoDyn's efforts to expand the potential therapeutic applications of leronlimab beyond its initial focus on HIV and oncology.

//Long COVID

CytoDyn has submitted a protocol to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a clinical trial to evaluate leronlimab in treating Long COVID, also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or Long Haulers syndrome. This submission represents a significant step in CytoDyn's efforts to address the ongoing health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Key points about CytoDyn's submission for Long Haulers:

1. The company has submitted a Phase 2 clinical trial protocol to the NIH for the treatment of Long COVID using leronlimab.
2. This submission follows CytoDyn's previous interactions with the FDA regarding the use of leronlimab for various COVID-19 related indications.
3. The proposed trial aims to evaluate leronlimab's efficacy in alleviating symptoms associated with Long COVID, which can persist for months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.
4. Leronlimab, as a CCR5 antagonist, is believed to have potential in modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation, which are key factors in Long COVID symptoms.
5. If approved, this trial could provide valuable data on leronlimab's effectiveness in treating a condition that affects millions of people worldwide and currently lacks standardized treatment options.

The submission to the NIH is a strategic move by CytoDyn, as it could potentially lead to:

* Collaboration with NIH researchers and access to additional resources
* Increased credibility for the study design and potential outcomes
* Faster patient recruitment and trial initiation if approved

It's important to note that while the submission is a positive step, it does not guarantee approval or immediate commencement of the trial. The NIH will review the protocol, and CytoDyn may need to address any feedback or concerns before the trial can proceed.  If approved and successful, this trial could position leronlimab as a potential treatment option for Long COVID, addressing a significant unmet medical need and potentially opening up a large market opportunity for CytoDyn.

//Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

CytoDyn has strategically positioned itself to pursue multiple avenues for investigating leronlimab's potential in treating conditions related to chronic fatigue. If the NIH does not grant approval for the Long COVID trial, CytoDyn has a backup plan in place with a contract for a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) trial. This approach demonstrates the company's commitment to exploring leronlimab's therapeutic potential in related conditions.  Key points about CytoDyn's CFS trial contract:

1. Contingency plan: The CFS trial contract serves as a fallback option, ensuring that CytoDyn can continue its research even if the Long COVID trial is not approved by the NIH.
2. Similarities in conditions: Both Long COVID and CFS share overlapping symptoms, particularly persistent fatigue and cognitive issues, making leronlimab a potentially relevant treatment for both conditions.
3. Expanded market potential: By pursuing trials in both Long COVID and CFS, CytoDyn is targeting a broader patient population, potentially increasing the drug's market reach if successful.
4. Scientific rationale: Leronlimab's mechanism of action as a CCR5 antagonist may be relevant to CFS, as immune dysfunction and inflammation are thought to play roles in both CFS and Long COVID.
5. Regulatory strategy: Having multiple trial options may strengthen CytoDyn's position with regulatory bodies, demonstrating the company's commitment to thoroughly investigating leronlimab's potential applications.

The existence of this CFS trial contract highlights CytoDyn's proactive approach to drug development and its confidence in leronlimab's potential therapeutic benefits. It also provides the company with flexibility in its clinical development program, allowing for continued progress even if one avenue faces setbacks.  If CytoDyn proceeds with the CFS trial, it could:

* Generate valuable data on leronlimab's efficacy in treating fatigue-related disorders
* Potentially lead to a new treatment option for CFS, a condition with limited effective therapies
* Provide insights that could be applicable to other fatigue-related conditions, including Long COVID

This dual-track approach underscores CytoDyn's commitment to exploring leronlimab's potential in addressing significant unmet medical needs in the realm of chronic fatigue-related disorders.

Brynn and her “Blackness”💁🏾‍♀️,RHONY,1i7tjsh,2025-01-22 21:51:16,187,0.91,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/RHONY/comments/1i7tjsh/brynn_and_her_blackness/,DonkBonk22,Brynn Whitfield 👠,"Is there any other black gyals or just people in general who feel icky with Brynn and her claiming herself as a black woman? 


I’m not trying to take her title of being a black woman away, it’s just as an obviously black woman, it feels lowkey disrespectful when she tries to include herself in the struggles that she as a white passing woman has no idea the extent of such as when she talks about how hard it is a black woman to make it in the corporate world. 

It feels like she weaponizes it in moments to gain sympathy and to show her struggles as being even worse because she’s a black woman. Like literally saying, 

“why can’t a black woman be successful” 

right before she potentially lies about another OBVIOUSLY black woman knowing and being ignorant to someone who was SA-ed. 

Or even the time she says to Ubah again to not continue looking like the “angry black woman” so it doesn’t turn off her white boyfriend. Does she realize how she sounds, like you sound like a 🦝 and as a white passing lowkey white woman, you have absolutely no right to say shit like that. 

Even OBVIOUSLY black light skin women for the most part know to not do shit like that. And not only does she tell her that, but she CONSISTENTLY pokes at Ubah the ENTIRE SEASON to try to get her to act out and call her crazy and gossip about her when Brynn LITERALLY just told her the “consequences” of doing such.  She actively wanted to make Ubah look like the “angry black” woman or at least egged on the Ubah to receive the very same “consequences” she “warned her” about. And the WHOLE time, Brynn gets to cry tears and be comforted and babied. 

And then the times she tries to make black jokes🌚, it literally feels like a white person trying to use AAVE for the first time to try and make conversation with black people. It’s almost as if she tries to put herself into a caricature of what she thinks a black woman is. Yet, she neglects to understand or at least acknowledge that she has the ability to walk in and out of these two worlds as she chooses. Something most black people cant. 

You get the privileges of being coddled and being able to have your tears wipe your problems away, and not having to carry the burdens the rest of us have to. Again, I’m not saying she doesn’t carry her own unique issues in regards to her own “blackness”, but it’s literally a drop compared to an ocean that she has shown throughout this and last season that she has NO understanding of. 


Damn……sorry that was a lot😭 she just really really pisses me off and weirds me the fuck out. Like no don’t include us in that mess of yours! 😷 Nuhuh"

"Trump's DeFi project buys $25 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, TRON, AAVE and ENA",CapitalistExploits,1i7rxrx,2025-01-22 20:30:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7rxrx/trumps_defi_project_buys_25_million_worth_of/,kayakero,,"US President-elect Donald Trump, through his DeFi project **World Liberty Financial (WLFI)**, recently made a major operation in the cryptocurrency market.

WLFI acquired approximately $24.6 million worth of altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ENA).

According to data from the Arkham platform, the WLFI treasury converted around $24.6 million of the USDC stablecoin into these cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, the project purchased $4.7 million of each token, except for Ethena, with an investment of $2.3 million. These acquisitions reflect a strategy of diversifying WLFI's assets, moving away from stablecoins and betting on more speculative tokens.

# Trump's crypto project

Currently, WLFI has a diversified portfolio, with the largest holding of **43,000 ETH**, valued at approximately **$143 million** , representing the largest stake. Additionally, it holds **$96 million in Tether (USDT)** and **$56 million in USD Coin (USDC)**.

Other assets include nearly **$6.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, Aave and Chainlink** , **$4.6 million in Tron** and **$3 million in Ethena**.

>Also, WLFI added memecoins to its portfolio, purchasing Hoppy (""Pepe's friend""), and interestingly Pulsechain  (PLS), Richard Heart token is part of the holdings.

It is important to note that despite the recent launch of Trump's official memecoin, **$TRUMP, which generated $25 billion** in revenue in 24 hours, WLFI did not acquire any tokens of this cryptocurrency.

In November, Tron founder Justin Sun invested **$30 million** in WLFI tokens and was quickly appointed as an advisor to the project.

Recently, WLFI sold close to **$10 million worth of WBTC tokens** days before the presidential inauguration. This move sparked speculation, although WLFI stated that these transactions are part of its regular asset management.

The WLFI wallet also saw significant deposits in Ethereum and USDT. Despite the controversies and with a total value estimated at over **$17 million** , the project remains open and is looking to raise **$300 million** by selling **20 billion WLFI tokens**.

# CHAPTER 29 - LOADOUT PART 2

# MEANWHILE....

***DATE: APRIL 28******^(th)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD AAV “CONTACT ONE”***

**CAPTAIN HENRY O'TOOLE**

 

""Paul!"" Henry jumped up from his seat and bolted for the door.

""Relax, Captain, his vitals are fine. He just blacked out from the exertion of overusing his telekinesis. His neural temperatures are dropping already. That cooling amp he has installed is a fairly ingenious piece of engineering. We have already begun working on unlocking its secrets and seeking ways to upgrade it."" Roh Thaad'at stated calmly.

""Never mind all that! What were you thinking? There is no way that was a fair fight."" Henry turned his anger towards the Alderei.

""The lieutenant needed to be humbled. Sending him down to the surface without doing so would have gotten him and a lot of your soldiers killed and we would have wasted our one and only remaining chance to liberate this system from the Nephaeli'im.""

Henry stared at the unblinking eyes of the alien intelligence, breathing evenly as his fury waned. ""I don't disagree that he needed to be humbled... but you need to keep me in the loop with such plans, especially ones that run the risk of injuring or even killing my men."" Henry said, trying to find the most diplomatic wording to express his frustration.

""The simulator is designed to stop short of dealing out any such injuries, as you saw. I see your point, however, and while informing the lieutenant of the plan would have ruined its effect, I should have at least told you."" Roh Thaad'at agreed.

""So this Dyeus Pahter, is that one of the god-kings we will have to face?"" Henry asked, turning his concern to the ease at which it had dispatched Paul.

""Not exactly, the character is an amalgamation of several existing God-kings with a combination of storm god and solar god powers. We used this as one of the primary training program for the teams we sent to the surface during our first attempt. Some of those agents are still alive on the surface and will be able to provide covert intel and assistance, but most have ultimately failed in their larger directives. We hope that your team will have sufficient numbers and support to succeed. The Koryos of the Sky Father is the second most difficult training simulation and is meant to be challenged with a full party at a much higher integration level. The fact that Paul was able to get as far as he did single handed speaks well for his chances, though I would advise you to not tell him that. Instead, it would be best if he uses this as motivation to train ever harder and to take the threat before him more seriously.""

Despite his misgivings, Henry saw the cold logic in the Alderei leader's words. ""Fair enough, what do you mean by integration level? You have mentioned that several times now.""

""Ah, that's right, you haven't been augmented yet so you wouldn't have access to the file that explains it. An augmentation integration level is an approximate measure of both how deeply an augmentation has been integrated as well as a means to track the body's own muscle memory and neural pathways as they learn to control this newfound power. In the case of the titanium osteo-cladding, for example, it is how many nano-machines have been produced, how much bone has been covered, along with how many electrical pulse fusion events have been completed. The electro-muscle upgrade is a measure of how much electro-muscle has been produced and installed as well as how much fine control over power output has been achieved. It also refers to how well theoretical knowledge uploaded such as spear and sword fighting combat subroutines have been integrated into working knowledge in neuron connections and in muscle memory.""

""So when we saw Paul getting hammered around, barely being able to block or deflect a blow, and losing in strength contests, it was because of his low integration level, then?"" Henry asked.

""Correct, by the time he is even at a fifty percent integration level, his skin and muscles will be effectively bulletproof against most small arms fire, he will be able to block and deflect blows with ease and minimal pain or resonance feedback and he will be able to fight like a veteran trained since birth with the spear and sword. At one hundred percent integration, he will be able to tear through steel hull plate with his bare hands, jump many times his own height, lift many multiples of his body weight with ease and will probably have two to three times his current body mass. We are researching a special resonance device for him that will dramatically improve the power output of his telekinesis so that he will still be able to fly, but it may be easier to loot one from one of the god-kings in the meantime should he come across it. Such technology has been known to be theoretically viable, but we have not pursued it like the Nephaeli'im have, as our race has no natural telekinetics.""

""Christ almighty, he's going to turn into Superman by the time he has completed his integration... They all are. This is going to really complicate things. How long will it take for integration to reach that stage?"" Henry asked, getting a little intimidated at the idea of having a bunch of mutant superheroes running around his ship denting the decks when they walked and being completely unstoppable should they get a mind to become troublemakers.

""Years, if not decades, if they survive that long. The first ten to thirty percent will happen rather quickly. With the time acceleration feature activated in the training chamber, we will be able to pack months of training into mere weeks. Your ground teams should all be close to thirty percent integration by the time we move into the inner solar system to attack the system defense fleet. The remaining levels will have to be earned on Earth in combat and strife. As the integration level rises, the difficulty of advancement rises as well, eventually becoming near exponential by the highest integration levels. There should be enough time to grow in wisdom and restraint to counterbalance the extremes of their power.""

That should have made Henry feel better, but looking through the transparent wall at the now-stirring Paul, Henry felt only dread.

A/N: I was over the character limit by several thousand characters, and I didn't feel like cutting content, so here we are. "

# CHAPTER 29 - LOADOUT PART 1

***DATE-: APRIL 28******^(th)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD AAV “CONTACT ONE”***

**LIEUTENANT PAUL KARST**

 

Paul followed close behind Henry as they followed Roh Thaad’at through the labyrinthine halls of his Interdictor class flagship.

“Have you finalized the list of your combat crew to be augmented?” The Alderei Commandant asked.

“That we have, we've had them brought aboard so as to be ready to begin. How many can you accommodate at one time?” Henry replied.

“We have four augmentation surgery pods available, so if you want to call up the first group, we can begin at any time. I wanted to show you the armory in the meantime.” The alien leader replied.

“Excellent, the first four are already here amongst our guard retinue.” Henry replied. “Were you able to accommodate myself and our lead scientist with extra dose each of functional immortality and with a neural supercomputer?”

“Yes, we found there were enough extra in storage to be able to fulfill your request. Will you want to be first or last?” Roh Thaad’at asked.

“We can be last, let’s get our combat teams outfitted first.”

“Very well, then Lor Ix’Alderos will lead your first batch of warriors off for augmentation. I noticed your retinue was a little larger today than normal.”

A bright, almost blinding, flash of light appeared before their helmet's light filters blocked out the worst of it. Lor Ix’Alderos appeared as if out of nowhere at the center of the light.

*Showoff.* Paul thought.

“Cool trick.” Henry deadpanned.

“Humph. I was on the other side of the ship, this was the most expedient means of transport. If your first four warriors to be augmented would follow after me, we can get started. We will have them back to you by the end of today’s meetings. Hurry along now, I am quite busy. *I do* have my regular duties to return to.” Lor Ix’Alderos stated in his usual brusque manner.

Lance motioned to his fellow soldiers who would be joining the first round to follow along behind him.

“Alright, you heard him, let’s get going.” The four of them split of and left through a side passage that opened in the hallway wall before it sealed shut behind them.

“The armory is just around the corner here. We had some tech weapons and armor delivered by wormhole just yesterday, and in enough quantity to give your combat teams some flexibility in armament choices.” Roh Thaad’at said before he waved at another section of wall to create a doorway for them after they'd rounded the corner.

They passed through the opened doorway into a large room with a wall filled with racks of exotic looking weapons. In front of them were a number of silver metallic mannequins kitted out in full Alderei armor sets. Each item had a translucent red dot superimposed over it that expanded into a larger descriptive menu when Paul focused on them. Frustratingly, all of the alien weapons and armor had their stats redacted.

*Oh well, can’t really blame them for keeping some secrets close to their chest...* Paul mused.

Over on the opposing wall, ten armored humanoid mannequins stood with an array of swords, daggers, axes, spears and bows of varying styles hanging on the wall behind them. When Paul focused on the blue dot icon over these, a full description did pop up for him to review. He immediately began to busy himself reading through the myriad options as the Alderei began his description for the benefit of those in the room who hadn't yet received a neural supercomputer and ocular scanner.

“We have enough armaments here to give your ground teams some flexibility of choice in how to equip themselves according to personal preference and the needs of the mission. We also have a full hard light holographic training floor with an adjustable time dilation field that will allow you to experience weeks of practice time inside the envelope with mere days passing for those on the outside. Your ground teams thus can quickly familiarize themselves with their new gear while fighting AI opponents.”

“Excellent! I’m sure our teams will be glad for the opportunity to train. What can you tell me about these different gear sets?” Henry asked.

“There are three armor types. Scout armor is lighter and trades defense for optical camouflage; we have two sets of this type. They actively bend light around their wearer to make them invisible to the naked eye for short periods of time before they need to recharge their internal capacitors by either absorbing solar energy or by standing within the influence of a wireless electric field. They are designed to appear similar to a well made set of leather armor to casual eyes, though they have flexible graphene armor plates protecting vital areas. They also have a photonic shield that can save their user's life against an otherwise fatal blows, but they are not meant for primary combat. One minute of optical camouflage equates to the power draw for one second of photonic shielding.”

Paul’s scan of the set informed him that they needed thirty minutes to charge five minutes of active camouflage, or five photonic shield charges, or a little less than half that under a wireless electrical field.

*Optical camo? I can think of several ways that would be useful for scouting and wetwork.*

“There are four sets of Ranger armor available. They are modeled to appear like a set of scale armor and have reactive photonic shields and telekinetic jump boosters. Like the scout armor, they have inbuilt capacitors that can be charged photovoltaically or by proximity to a source of wireless electricity. There are five jump charges with a five minute charge time to restore one jump charge. Like the scout armor, it has a single use photonic shield burst which will consume one of the five available charges.”

Henry nodded along. “You have mentioned twice now about wireless electricity, where would we acquire a generator of that type? We don’t have that technology ourselves right now. Well... *we do,* just not in a useful way we can deploy in combat. Ours is very short range and is mostly used to charge small devices.”

“I was going to explain that next. These last four armor sets are the Guardian armor variant and are designed to look like a full set of Olympian style plate armor. They are made of the same alloy that our ships are, and thus are self-repairing and can be equipped or shed in a matter of seconds from the power belt here. The suit is powered by a direct zero-width wormhole uplink to our ship here, and the armor emits a ten meter wireless electric field in atmosphere. This armor set also has a reactive photonic shield generated from the left gauntlet that can form a hard-light shield using photonic masking to make it appear like a mundane shield. The right gauntlet can fire a powerful laser from its wrist generator. Either side can be adapted here in the workshop to either form a shield or fire a laser depending on user preferences. Because of the embedded technology, the gauntlets and the helmet are the only sections not stored in the belt. This armor also has an integrated full body photonic shield that is powered by wormhole link, which will activate when required to save the operator's life. It is limited by heat buildup and other factors, so multiple sustained powerful hits will deplete its capacity and render it useless while the suit recharges, cools, and the self repair feature kicks in.”

Paul couldn’t help but smile. *I want one of those.*

Henry let out a slow whistle. “That will turn just about anyone into a one-man army.”

“That is the idea, yes. Now, there are five weapon types, all made from our proprietary alloy, meaning they will self-sharpen, and will self-repair in the presence of a wireless electric field. They also will build up capacitor charge over time which can be selectively released for a powerful electric shock. The only sure way to kill one of the god-king war bodies is by decapitation or the destruction of the heart, otherwise their self-healing capability will rapidly close the wound and work to repair the internal damage. A full capacitor shock should destroy their internal nanomachinery and hopefully stun them long enough for a killing blow.”

“I see, are there any other ways to reliably kill one of them? I see the bows up there as well, just no quivers or arrows.” Henry asked.

“Those are photonic bows; they manufacture their own hard light arrows with each shot. They have a maximum capacity of twenty charges when outside of a wireless electricity field, though they can charge photovoltaically at a slightly slower pace to regenerate charges. They pierce most armor types quite effectively and cauterize their wounds, making it difficult for self-healing to occur. A head shot or heart shot could be fatal, even to a war body, though it takes great skill and even some measure of luck to successfully kill such a powerful foe with this weapon.  Together, a team with two guardians, two rangers, and one scout should be able to take out even the most powerful of the god-kings with relative ease. If you find yourself up against a small party of them, the battle will be much more challenging, but the odds will still be in your favor with good team cohesion and strategy.”

“You said most of the pantheons have had their numbers thinned out after the Olympians seized power, correct?”

“Yes, but there are still enough of the titanic pantheon and of the Egyptian pantheons who have survived the Titanomachy to be highly dangerous were they to combine their numbers for a massed attack. You must endeavor to kill as many of them as you can in small groups or alone to prevent this from occurring. There are other pantheons also alive and well on the fringes of the geopolitical map, but they lack the extensive nanotechnology augmentations that the Titanic, Egyptian and Olympian pantheons had enjoyed. Zeus has jealously guarded their remaining technology stocks since the events of the Titanomachy in an effort to avoid the usurpation of his own throne in a manner similar to how he himself had acquired it.”

“This is still pretty hard to wrap my head around even now. We had spent our lives up until now assuming these myths were simple stories that helped explain a mysterious world to ancient peoples. I suppose in some ways that is still the truth, even with what we have discovered about this timeline. The only thing that changed is the source of the myths and the motivations of the minds that created them.” Henry said.

“I understand how this must be challenging for you, having the very bedrock of your understanding so thoroughly destroyed in this way. We sympathize with your position.” Roh Thaad'at replied.

“Thank you, we certainly appreciate your support.” Henry replied drily while he inspected each of the weapon types one by one. “One thing is for sure; we will not rest until our world is liberated. What are these?” Henry asked, after looking at the same thing that had caught Paul’s attention.

“The scanner says they are Eviscerator Grenades, whatever that means. The scanner just says they are wormhole linked grenades that summon one Eviscerator unit into service under your command.” Paul replied, just barely resisting the urge to pick it up.

“Correct. We intended to supply you with four of these, which is all we can spare at the moment. An Eviscerator is a semi sentient machine soldier, the very same ones that you have seen acting as bodyguards to our representatives up until now. They are quite formidable on the battlefield, but they are also a dead giveaway that you have accepted Alderei support. We ask that you save them only for moments of only the direst need. Once you have summoned an Eviscerator it will remain with you until it’s antimatter reaction charge has been depleted. As it is made of advanced meta-materials and our super alloys, it can self-repair and reform itself into various shapes and configurations. It also can use part of its antimatter charge in a single beam attack that is shaped using a photonic barrel. We call it the annihilation beam, and it is powerful enough to bring down a warship or atomize any foe, though it will rapidly deplete their power source.”

“Jesus, you guys don’t fuck around in warfare, do you?” Paul asked, going white as a sheet.

The casual use of antimatter was no laughing matter.

“No, as we highly value our people's lives. It is our technological edge that stopped the war last time and forced the Nephaeli’im to sue for peace. It is therefore quite troubling to us that we have seen a recent resurgence in provocations at the border of our territory once more. Our enemy has grown emboldened of late.”

“Peace through superior firepower, I can get behind a policy like that. Sad it doesn’t last forever though. Inevitably the enemy forgets and will need to be taught a lesson all over again.” Paul said.

Henry laughed behind him.

“Indeed. A true shame they never learn.” Roh Thaad’at replied sagely. “This is why it is imperative that you use these with the utmost discretion. We cannot be seen as being the ones provoking war. All it takes is one message sent back to Apophis with proof of Alderei aggression to give him an excuse to go to war with us all over again. Rah and Apophis may have hated one another, but Rah is still missing along with Nii’Baruu, his original super-dreadnought colony ship. Zeus may well have no qualms against seeking help at this stage. For these reasons, it is best they underestimate you until it is too late, and that there is no sign of our involvement.”

“You mentioned Nii’Baruu before, but we never really asked about what that is. How sure are we that it is truly missing, you said we had to fight two dreadnoughts in system to gain access to Earth. How do we know that this Nii’Baruu won’t return and ambush us?”

“They have both been missing since Aten’s betrayal, if they could come back they would have done so by now to overthrow Zeus. Rah was in his own way a far more dangerous foe than Zeus ever was, and with Nii’Baruu at his command, he was nigh invincible. It was only through his arrogance, and through subterfuge that this great threat was able to be nullified. Nii’Baruu is a nearly five hundred kilometer diameter Dyson Sphere made of a gold-heavy Electrium alloy whose primary armament was to fire guided plasma slugs larger than your flagship from a direct core tap from the corona of the artificial star powering its heart. If Rah were ever to be revived or released from whatever imprisonment has hidden him away then the consequences would be catastrophic. Even a combined fleet with our Interdictors and your Indomitable Will would struggle against its might. Its only weakness is that Rah was too paranoid to allow anyone else to have control over its systems. Without Rah, it will remain inert and out of the fight, wherever it has been hidden away.”

*Well… fuck…* Paul thought, at a loss for words.

“Something that big cannot possibly hide forever. We should at least try to locate it. Perhaps we can seize control of it with your assistance once the system has been purged of Nephaeli’im influence. That would make a formidable war asset for humankind and would likely propel our scientific understanding forward by thousands of years as we worked through understanding its technology.” Henry replied, sounding a little too excited.

Paul had nothing other than a horrible foreboding feeling about the matter. *That ship would be a poison pill...*

“I fear that will be more difficult to accomplish than it is to speak of in our idle planning. We will put this to a vote in consensus once you have secured the system. We fear this topic to be a distraction from the already difficult task you face. We recommend getting back on topic. Lieutenant Paul Karst, would you like to be first to try the simulator in full gear? There is a self-sealing undersuit over there that will be necessary to wear as well.”

*Hell fucking yes I would!* Paul smirked and hit the seal release on his helmet, and handed it off to one of the marines they had with them. He then gave the command to release the armor seals on his Paladin suit before the plates separated away from each other against the back of his arms and legs and the back of the hauberk lifted away, allowing him to step out of the armor.

“You better believe it! I was hoping you would offer. Saves me from having to ask!” He smiled. He could see Henry slowly shaking his head from peripheral vision, but Paul didn’t care one bit.

*He’s just jealous.* Paul smirked as he stripped down to his briefs and stepped into the undersuit. The material seemed to zipper itself closed without a visible seam as he brought both halves up over his chest. Moments afterward, it squeezed down tightly against his skin as his eyes bugged out in shock. After he composed himself, he walked up to the suit of Guardian armor he had been eyeing and scanned it.

|ACCESSING ARMOR COMMAND UI… ACCESS GRANTED. NEW OWNER IDENTIFIED.|
|:-|
|**CREATING BIOMETRIC KEY… COMPLETE**|

The suit then liquefied and slid down the body of the mannequin until it retreated fully into the belt. As soon as he grabbed for it, the latch in the front popped open, allowing him to remove it. It was shockingly heavy, though that didn’t entirely surprise him. As soon as he wrapped it around himself, it latched on automatically and cinched itself down to a comfortable tightness. He then removed the gauntlets and slid them over his hands.

|PREFERENCES SAVED. BIOMETRIC KEY LOGGED.|
|:-|
|**GUARDIAN ARMOR READY TO DEPLOY ON COMMAND**|

“Suit up!” *God that sounded lame, never saying that shit again...* Paul thought as he heard Henry just barely controlling a chuckle behind his back.

Paul was then distracted by the rather uncomfortable sensation of being coated in a cold liquid metal that spread from the belt outwards. He began to panic slightly, in spite of himself. This forced him to clench his jaw and focus hard on staying calm until the metal solidified and encased him in the armor. He then removed the helmet from the mannequin and donned it. It had no face shield or advanced UI aside from the fact that it seemed to reshape itself to comfortably fit over his head. Thankfully, he found that he could see perfectly through it, anyway, likely with the help of his neural supercomputer filling in the gaps despite the rather small eye slit.

“Remember, this is not void rated armor, so we do not recommend using it off world or in boarding operations. We are working on armor upgrade modules that will fix this shortcoming. In the meantime, you seem to have perfectly adequate armor already for that purpose should the need arise in the short run. These were designed to give the best protection possible while still giving plausible deniability as to its high technology nature and origin. Go ahead and test its flexibility if you wish, and then equip yourself with your primary and secondary weapons of choice. Once you are ready I will lead you to the simulator.”

Paul performed a series of stretches to test his mobility. To his surprise, it felt like he was completely unencumbered in his range of motion, other than a general feeling of being weighed down. That was definitely manageable, no doubt the additional electro-muscle being manufactured in his body would help tremendously with mitigating that over time.

*Shouldn't take too long to get used to.* He decided.

He then eyed the swords and scanned one that reminded him of a gladius with a double-edged, intermediate length blade with a blood channel running down the center and a red crystal in the pommel.

*This one looks promising...*

He scanned it to read more details before deciding for sure.

*Sounds good to me.* Paul thought as he removed the sword and its sheath from the wall.

He swung it a few times to get a feel for its heft. Once he was satisfied with its balance, he sheathed it and snapped it onto a magnetic clip on his belt.

|SWORD-FIGHTING COMBAT SUBROUTINES UPLOADED… 1% ESTIMATED MUSCLE MEMORY INTEGRATION|
|:-|


“That’s a good sword. It should do nicely for close in work as a secondary weapon. Now for something with some reach...” He looked over at the two spear types and considered his options.

|| || |**HEARTSEEKER; SEEKING TECH SPEAR** – MEDIUM SIZED THROWING SPEAR WITH LIMITED MID-FLIGHT COURSE CORRECTION CAPABILITY. UTILIZES A HEAT SEEKING SENSOR AND MANEUVERING FINS TO SEEK ITS TARGET WHILE THROWN MOMENTUM LASTS. | |**LIMITED RECALL** – 3 CHARGES, 20 METER MAXIMUM RANGE. **REQUIRES GAUNTLET UPGRADE MODULE.** | |**CAPACITOR SHOCK** –  DISCHARGES STORED ELECTRICITY INTO DESIGNATED TARGET ON USER COMMAND. **DEPLETES ALL LIMITED RECALL CHARGES; MANUAL RETRIEVAL REQUIRED AFTER USE.

*Now that is useful.* Paul thought before he looked at the other spear. This one was longer and was a trident style with a large central blade and two shorter curved side blades that would be useful for blocking strikes and disarming opponents. It also had a reinforced hand grip, no doubt to keep a better hold while blocking. Embedded in the hand grip was a silver plate, likely a conductive plate for direct electricity transfer, similar to how their Patriot mechs provided power to their rifles.

He scanned the little blue icon to read its description page to compare.

|| || |**STORMBREAKER; COMBAT TECH SPEAR –**  LENGTH ADJUSTABLE IN COMBAT PLUS OR MINUS 30 PERCENT. **REQUIRES NEURAL COMPUTER CONNECTION. REQUIRES ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION PLATE GAUNTLET UPGRADE MODULE.** | |**CAPACITOR SHOCK** –  DISCHARGES STORED ELECTRICITY INTO DESIGNATED TARGET ON USER COMMAND. **DAMAGE OUTPUT DEPENDENT ON AVAILABLE CHARGE.** | |**CHARGE RECOVERY SPEED** – 3 MINUTES TO FULL VIA CONDUCTIVE PLATE. | |**SELF REPAIR SPEED** \- SLOW WHILE CHARGING, FAST AT FULL CHARGE| |**BIOMETRIC LOCK** – UNCLAIMED|

*Fuck that’s a hard choice. The throwing spear sounds more like my fighting style though, especially since it will pair nicely with my TK, it would make it easy to recover it and increase the power behind my throws... There’s also something to be said about the synergy of my TK with Stormbreaker as well. Pulling people towards my spear tip, disarming them and snatching their weapon towards me before finishing them off… I can see the value in both….*

***The trident is the better choice... a disarmed opponent is a fearful opponent... a fearful opponent is as good as a dead one...***

*Hey now, I make the choices around here! Just so happens that I do think you are right. I'll probably try Stormbreaker first, but I need to know something before I make my final decision...*

“So tell me about this biometric lock, if I test one spear and want to go with the other can I do so without locking another person out of a weapon?” Paul asked.

“You can manually release the biometric lock at any time through your neural computer connection so long as you are within twenty meters of the weapon. It will also automatically release its lock if its owner expires on the battlefield and the weapon survives. Part of our offer of using the simulator is to allow you to get a feel for the different weapons and to decide which is best for you.” Roh Thaad’at answered, helping ease Paul’s mind tremendously.

*Well, in that case…* He reached out and grabbed one of the Stormbreaker spears off the wall along with a matching spear sling and rectangular gauntlet upgrade module.

|SPEAR-FIGHTING COMBAT SUBROUTINES UPLOADED… 1% ESTIMATED MUSCLE MEMORY INTEGRATION|
|:-|


Embedded in the combat subroutines was a helpful instruction on how to place the gauntlet upgrade and where to place the sling. Both melded perfectly into their respective spots simply by placing them over the indicated locations. He then shortened his new spear down and clicked it into its new saddle on his back. In the lower right hand corner of his heads up display overlay a small trident head icon appeared with a charge bar slowly filling. Instinctive knowledge granted from the combat subroutines informed him it was charging through its connection to its sling on his back. He noticed that there was also a sword icon below it’s own charge level showing it was one third full already.

*ET tech is fucking awesome.*

“I’m ready, let’s go!” Paul said, getting himself psyched up and ready to fight.

“Very well, the training room is across the hall.”

Roh Thaad’at waived a hand and a door opened in the wall along with another directly across from it on the other side of the hallway outside. They moved together into the other room, where multiple chairs formed from the deck below. A door opened in the opposing wall with a holographic rune that read ""Training room"". He realized with a shock that he could read the alien script now, likely thanks to the auto translation program embedded in his new neural computer. The large flat metallic wall to the left of the doorway turned transparent to Paul’s astonishment, showcasing a large open chamber with a huge open air ceiling that must have been several stories high.

Paul marched without hesitation into the large room. All around him, the room seemed to change into a wide open grassland with some large boulders strewn about. The level of realism was astounding. He reached down and felt the grass, which moved and felt quite real to him. He then walked up and struck a boulder with the palm of his hand. Somehow, they had replicated a feeling of sturdy density with their holograms. He lifted a smaller rock and threw it, just to have it clatter and break apart against another larger boulder.

“Well, shit, color me impressed. This is incredible! How can you do this?! Never mind, I doubt I’d understand the jargon anyway.” Paul laughed aloud.

He was so engrossed in the environment he almost missed the signs that danger had arrived. Luckily, his computer had his back in the form of his new heartbeat sensor.

|THREAT DETECTED: HUMAN, QUANTITY: SIX, THREAT LEVEL: LOW|
|:-|


*Handy little thing, that.*

He turned around to see a war band of five rather burly young men armed with assorted clubs, axes, and swords made of bronze with hilts wrapped in leather. Each of them was bare chested and wore thick leather and cloth armored kilts around their waists and wolf-skin cloaks over their heads and which hung down over their shoulders and their backs. Several had shields of stretched hide over a wooden frame. The largest of them boldly strode forward, snarling as fiercely as the wolf that he had killed to make his cloak.

*That’s five… where’s number six?* Paul looked around for the other, likely an archer.

“Identify yourself, stranger! You trespass in our lands, and you are outnumbered. Lay down your arms and armor and we will let you pass freely and in safety.”

“I have no quarrel with you and yours! As you can see I am well armed and will not surrender myself or my arms without a fight.” Paul scoffed.

*Cheeky little fucker.*

He grabbed the spear from his back and extended it out. He then summoned his shield which solidified to look like a sturdy wooden kite shield with a wicked spike in the center and a studded steel border. The shield felt nearly weightless and hung off his wrist solidly, leaving his left hand free.

“*Sorcery*! No matter, you’ll bleed all the same. He has chosen his fate. We can just as easily strip the corpse. Spread out!” Their leader roared as he charged.

Ancient instinct honed by upgraded reflexes and the increased reaction times afforded by his neural computer kicked in all at once, causing time to slow perceptibly.

|FIGHT OR FLIGHT DETECTED; COMBAT HORMONE PRODUCTION RELEASE APPROVED|
|:-|


Feeling more alive than ever, Paul leapt several meters to the side with stunning ease and charged the man on the right, striking at him with inhuman speed. The man brought up his shield to block, though against the alien alloy, it may have well as been made of paper. Paul gored him straight through the shield, pushing into his chest and lifting him off the ground. He pivoted and threw the dead man into his nearest fellow with a cracking sound. A painful impact struck Paul in the small of the back. He turned to see a shattered arrow lying in the ground, having utterly failed to pierce his armor.

*That would be number six. Now where are you?*

In the moment he allowed himself to be distracted, the next two closest men had closed the gap and attacked from opposing sides. Paul roared and caught the sword of the man to his right between the prongs of his trident and twisted it out of his hands before he slashed laterally across his stomach, spilling his guts into the grass. He then blocked the cudgel strike of the other man with his shield, shortened his spear up and pushed him back with a series of thrusting blows. Another arrow narrowly missed him, this time right over his shoulder. He now had a rough idea of where the annoying archer was hiding.

***There! By the twin boulders... use fear to flush it out... the Alderei seem to infuse... synthetic emotion into A.I... such a shame that code cannot truly feel fear... we hunger... while you remain in space...***

*Not now, Creepy, I need to focus! I'll take the tactical tips, but cut the unnecessary commentary, please.*

“You will meet your gods this day!” Their leader shouted in rage as he raised his axe for a powerful two handed blow from behind Paul.

The man with the bronze cudgel kept falling back just out of reach of Paul’s spear, expertly using it to knock his blows just slightly off course at the last second. Paul attempted to dodge the axe blow, only managing to take a glancing strike which shattered the man’s axe and staggered him. He then used his left arm to form a TK field just behind the annoying cudgel bearer, lifting him into the sky. Paul then threw him straight into his leader. They both landed hard with a painful sounding crunch.

“FLEE NOW AND YOU MAY YET LIVE!” He shouted as he caught another arrow midair that he was lucky enough to see flying toward him.

He then threw the arrow to the ground off to the side. That seemed to break the archer’s spirit and he fled from his hiding place behind a boulder. There was no trace also of the man he had thrown his first victim into either, meaning two had fled and two were dead. His last two opponents raised themselves slowly, warily to their feet. Their leader held his side and coughed up blood.

“*Who are you!? Have we angered one of the gods for such misfortune to befall us!?”*

Paul smirked inside of his helmet. “Yes, That is precisely what you have done in your foolishness! Now leave this place while my mercy still exists. There is no honor in killing defeated men.”

The pair of them hobbled off, disappearing once they reached the edge of the simulator room walls. Paul was beginning to feel quite good about himself and their prospects on the surface until a circular swirling storm cloud began to form overhead. A single shaft of light illuminated Paul from its center, blinding him. He rapidly began to feel like he was boiling alive in his armor, so he leapt backwards and out of the center of the beam.

**“LIAR!”**

Just as Paul began to open his eyes a crack and to block the still-blinding light with one hand, he heard a loud crack, and he was knocked from his feet with a tremendous blow.

|ELECTRIC SHOCK DEFLECTED; PHOTONIC SHIELD DEPLOYED…|
|:-|
|**60% INTEGRITY REMAINING… RECHARGING**|

Paul scrambled back to his feet and retrieved his spear just in time to see something slowly descending from the blinding gap in the clouds

|| || |**THREAT DETECTED**, NEPHAELI’IM-HUMAN HYBRID; SKY FATHER ARCHETYPE, QUANTITY: ONE,| |**THREAT LEVEL:** **DEADLY**, AVERAGE INTEGRATION LEVEL TOO LOW; **RETREAT RECOMMENDED**|

*Fuck, that guy hits like a tank!* A veritable giant floated in the air in front of him decked out in gold inlaid steel plate armor. He was shorter than the average pure blood Nephaeli’im giant, but he still stood at least a meter taller than Paul. Though decidedly less pronounced, he also had the iconic elongated skull recognizable in spite of the decorative golden crown set amidst his silvery hair.

“How *dare you* impersonate a God! Impetuous mortal, you will learn your place! I am Dyeus Pahter, I know all, I see all, and I judge you unworthy. Your sentence is DEATH!”

Multiple lightning bolts struck the ground around him in blinding flashes and deafening cracks as his twin sided war hammer returned to his hand. Wasting no more time, Dyeus charged from his position midair and flew down towards Paul, who raised his spear and shield in preparation.

“Bring it, sparky!”

*Computer, can we filter out the bright lights? I can’t fight him like this.*

|DYNAMIC LIGHT FILTERS CREATED… APPLYING SETTINGS|
|:-|


Suddenly, he could see much better, allowing Paul to open his eyes fully as he turned his spear into the path of the charging god. Dyeus knocked his spear to the side completely out of his hands with a mighty blow and effortlessly turned his body mid-flight to set up a follow up strike now inside of Paul’s defenses. Paul leaped backwards a step and deflected his follow up strike with his shield, which rattled his arm and caused him to skid backwards in the grass.

Dyeus then moved to strike with a two handed overhead chop. As his strike neared the apex of his swing, a bolt of lightning struck his weapon, and jumped the gap to strike Paul’s raised shield in the moment before impact. The combined attack overloaded the hard light generator in his gauntlet, knocking Paul to the ground.

|SHIELD GAUNTLET OVERLOAD DETECTED... SELF-REPAIR ACTIVATED|
|:-|


Paul rolled on the ground to the left and the right in desperate attempts to dodge the next series of blows that rained down towards him at inhuman speeds. In a fit of quick thinking, Paul threw his hand out and formed the most powerful TK field he could muster behind Dyeus, staggering him backwards by a mere handful of steps.

*Heavy bastard; that would have sent a normal man flying!*

Capitalizing on his moment to breathe, Paul then pulled his spear back to himself with another TK field and went on the attack. This time, he was the one raining down quick and powerful blows, forcing Dyeus to dodge and deflect his attacks for a change. The god smirked behind his helmet.

**""It would seem you are more worthy a foe than you would appear; it is a rare thing to face such a powerful human telekinetic! Let’s see if you can fly as well as you can fight!”** With a contemptuous laugh, Dyeus disengaged and lifted off into the sky.

***Don't let him bait you... what are you doing?***

*I said to cut the commentary! I'm a damn good flyer! He wants a dogfight, he'll get a dogfight!*

Paul roared in frustration, snapped his spear against his back and chased after his quarry, using the foci in his left palm to control his flight, and activating the laser in his right gauntlet. His attempts to hit his target were frustrated by Dyeus’ constant changes in flight path and by the extreme turbulence created by his proximity to the swirling storm cloud overhead. His troubles were further compounded by his need to dodge the flying mace that Dyeus repeatedly threw at him, just for it to return to the god's hand for another throw. His brain began to burn with the mental exertion of maintaining his telekinesis at such an extreme level.

*I need to end this, quick! Think! Time for a new strategy…*

It seemed Dyeus had been thinking much the same thing, as this time when he caught his weapon, he spun about and charged straight at Paul like a speeding bullet train. The god then threw a lightning infused strike directly into Paul’s path.

*Oh fuck!* This time there was no dodging it.

|ELECTRIC SHOCK DEFLECTED; PHOTONIC SHIELD DEPLOYED…|
|:-|
|**30% INTEGRITY REMAINING… RECHARGING**|

Dazed and with a growing migraine, Paul struck the ground hard, skidding several meters.

|KINETIC ENERGY DEFLECT; PHOTONIC SHIELD GENERATOR OVERHEATED;|
|:-|
|**WARNING! SUIT SYSTEMS CRITICAL**|

Overhead, the backlit form of Dyeus lifted his hammer over his head and charged at Paul’s disoriented and abused body with another lightning imbued strike. In the last moment before impact, his form dissipated, and the room returned to the same sterile grey as he had originally seen it.

|FATAL BLOW AVERTED; TRAINEE UNABLE TO CONTINUE; SIMULATION TERMINATED|

***I warned you...***

Paul’s head dropped back down to the ground. Knowing he was safe, and unable to hold things together any longer, he blacked out.

"Whales Buy LDO & AAVE, This DAO Token Could Be the Next 10X Crypto",Blockviews,1i7j0eb,2025-01-22 14:05:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i7j0eb/whales_buy_ldo_aave_this_dao_token_could_be_the/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Whales shift focus to DAO tokens as retail buzz surrounds AI and meme coins

While the crowd chases trends, whales are making calculated moves on DAO tokens like Lido DAO ($LDO) and Aave ($AAVE). Yesterday, a whale acquired 2.72M $LDO, raising their total holdings to a staggering 5.565M tokens. At $1.90 per token, that’s a cool $10.5M in $LDO holdings. The market responded with an 8% spike to $1.96 before settling back at $1.90. Despite the volatility, this whale walked away with a neat 4% profit, as the entry price was $1.82.

$AAVE is another DAO token catching whale attention. A recent $750K transfer to cold storage indicates one investor’s long-term commitment to the platform. Meanwhile, another $AAVE player cashed out $11.3M in profits over two days but still holds 28K $AAVE with unrealized gains exceeding $7M. Even World Liberty Financial has placed $4.7M worth of $AAVE in its portfolio, ranking it among the company’s top six crypto assets.

The DAO token niche now holds a $40B market cap, with $UNI leading the pack at $7.9B. However, $AAVE is making strides with a $5.4B market cap. For whales, DAO investments don’t just deliver returns; they offer governance power, allowing them to influence the trajectories of these projects. With decentralization and transparency at their core, DAOs represent the forward march of Web3.

As whales pile into DAO tokens, retail investors have a new opportunity to join the movement. One stand-out in the space is Flockerz ($FLOCK), a fusion of a meme coin and DAO principles. With innovative Vote-to-Earn mechanics, high staking APY, and an engaged community, $FLOCK offers unique incentives for holders. The project has already raised $12.5M during its presale phase, but it’s coming to an end in just two hours. The flock is about to take flight, but you still have a chance to catch the tailwind.

The rise of DAO tokens highlights the decentralized finance revolution, putting power in the hands of communities. If whales are betting on this next evolution, perhaps it’s time to consider adding DAOs to your watchlist. Remember, even projects with solid fundamentals require thorough research.

"Trump Family To Build Businesses on Ethereum, Lubin says ‘World Liberty Financial is 100% Ethereum aligned’",draqai,1i7i4s3,2025-01-22 13:31:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i7i4s3/trump_family_to_build_businesses_on_ethereum/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Trump Family Goes Full Crypto, Loves Ethereum Vibes 💎  

In a surprising move, the Trump family is turning heads in the crypto world, and honey, it’s not just some meme coin drama this time! With World Liberty Financial putting serious dollars behind Ethereum, wrapped Bitcoin, AAVE, LINK, TRON, and ENA, they’re proving they know how to stack their digital assets like pros. Can you say power play?  

Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin couldn’t contain himself, spilling tea on how the Trump fam is ready to rule not just the White House but also the blockchain space. With $ETH positioned to dominate decentralized development in the U.S., we’re giving side-eye to anyone still sleeping on crypto’s potential.  

$WLFI, representing World Liberty Financial, dropped the mic with purchases totaling a jaw-dropping $108M of top-tier cryptocurrencies. The message is loud: big players are all about real utility and serious solutions. Meme coins? Not today, sweetie.  

Crypto just got presidential, babes. Are you keeping up, or are we leaving you in 2024?

Bitcoin Today 01/22/2025: Trump reference dominates cryptocurrency purchases,CapitalistExploits,1i7h5rt,2025-01-22 12:52:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7h5rt/bitcoin_today_01222025_trump_reference_dominates/,kayakero,,"Leaving behind the sharp correction of the previous day, Bitcoin (BTC) rose again and reached $105,000 USD, with a 2% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the main cryptocurrency in the market reached $105,275 USD, registering a growth of 2.1% in this period.

With this recovery, the Top 10 cryptocurrencies also showed notable gains. Solana (SOL), which suffered one of the biggest drops during the correction, appreciated by 6.3%, achieving the largest rise in the Top 10. This pushed its price up to $254 USD, accumulating a 36% increase in the last seven days.

On the other hand, the slogan “DOGE to Mars” benefited Dogecoin, the largest of the memecoins, which registered a 5.6% increase on Wednesday (22). In the Top 100, the AI16Z memecoin appreciated again with a rise of 34%, while XDC led the few falls in the ranking with a loss of 7%.

**Number 47**

Following the first day of the most pro-crypto president in US history, cryptocurrency prices experienced a sharp drop before recovering. But how can this be explained?

For Bitget analyst Bonveti, the market has a short memory, “like that of a goldfish.” According to him, investors tend to react more to immediate fears than to long-term plans.

Interestingly, while many were selling their tokens, Donald Trump made significant buying moves that are drawing attention. On the day of his inaugural address, President Trump invested $28 million USD in cryptocurrencies. According to Bonveti, the distribution was as follows:

* **$4.7 million USD** in ETH
* **$4.7 million USD** in WBTC
* **$4.7 million USD** in AAVE
* **$4.7 million USD** in LINK
* **$4.7 million USD** in TRX
* **$4.7 million USD** in ENA

>

It is worth noting that these purchases occurred after a sharp sell-off in the price of the $**TRUMP** memecoin, when several investors decided to take profits.

**Recovery**

Furthermore, Trump’s treasury wallet now contains $35.5 billion USD worth of TRUMP and $17.5 billion USD worth of other memecoins. This shows that the president has not yet liquidated all of his tokens, which have had a considerable impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, the **World Liberty Finance** project, backed by the Trump family, continues to diversify its sources of income. According to CriptoFácil, this project has accumulated at least $25 million USD in tokens such as LINK, TRX, AAVE and others.

The price of TRX has been holding up really well lately with large spikes of buy purchases, mainly probably because trumps company keeps buying more.

Marner would require a bag and a half, but I think he could be worth is long term, especially if we can find a way to ditch some of Jones's contract..

Some names I saw that could be of note include: Brock Boeser, Sam Bennet, Jordan Greenway, and Jack Roslovic.

Recent bullish developments on Ethereum.,ethtrader,1i7crse,2025-01-22 09:50:01,66,0.97,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i7crse/recent_bullish_developments_on_ethereum/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Sentiment,"Ethereum keeps proving everyone that it's the leading blockchain in crypto. In this post we will cover some of the most recent bullish updates that show us growing trust and reliance on Ethereum, not just by individuals but by institutions, banks, and even governments.

A wallet connected to President Trump’s team recently bought $47 million of ETH and wBTC (on Ethereum), and $4.7 million of AAVE, LINK, and ENA. This wallet is now staking ETH on Lido. To me, this shows they're willing to commit to Ethereum long-term. Another recent update is the Ethereum Foundation allocating 50,000 ETH for DeFi usage. Finally, we have Coinbase’s new BTC borrowing product. It relies heavily on Ethereum infrastructure and uses an Ethereum L2 and an ERC-20 token on the backend. Once again this proves that Ethereum is the center of decentralized finance.

Ethereum is slowly and steadily becoming the number one network for global finance on-chain. It doesn't rely on meme coins, AI hype, or social media marketing, because Ethereum’s strength is in its fundamental technology. This is what keeps huge investors building on it. A lot of big corporations and even central banks are secretly developing projects on Ethereum, the world is becoming increasingly tokenized and traditional finance is slowly going on-chain.

People are realizing that centralization is a threat to financial freedom, and Ethereum gives them a decentralized alternative where there are free markets for everyone. Look at what happened in the past 5 years. If Ethereum’s growth over the next 5 years is minimally close to the past, it could become the global standard for financial settlement

I’ll share the source for the metrics mentioned in the second paragraph in the comments.

**P.S. As I was writing this, news just came out about the founder of Lido creating a ""Second Foundation"" for Ethereum. I will also add the source in the comments.**"

WLFI announced that these investments were tied to Trump’s inauguration. On January 20, WLFI completed the placement of 20% of its token supply (100 billion tokens), raising $300 million. The project is now looking to sell an additional 5% of tokens due to strong investor demand.

According to Arkham Intelligence, the World Liberty portfolio is valued at approximately $355 million, with over half of this value tied to 58,646 ETH, which was worth $182.7 million at the time of reporting. This initiative was officially announced in September 2024 by Donald Trump’s sons, along with a token sale that began in mid-October.

I believe that the connection between cryptocurrency and political figures like WLFI and Trump adds significant weight to the perception of cryptocurrencies as a key financial instrument. This precedent may attract new investors, increase legitimacy for the industry, and encourage the development of favorable regulations. However, such initiatives bring risks as well. The politicization of the market could lead to increased volatility, dependence on government decisions, and heightened regulatory pressure. I think WLFI will serve as a test of how these political ties impact the industry in the long term.

There are two bathrooms, and currently, there are two AAV vents—one under the kitchen sink and one under the bathroom sink on the main floor. The upstairs bathroom does not have an AAV.

The problem is that whenever a toilet is flushed, both toilets gurgle shortly after. They also gurgle when the washing machine is running. However, everything else seems to drain fine, including sinks, showers, and the dishwasher, without any noticeable issues.

Could this be caused by a faulty AAV? Do I need to add a third AAV for the upstairs bathroom? Or would installing a roof stack be necessary? I don’t believe there’s a clog in the system anymore. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

Before I address that, I want to emphasize the importance of not mocking any of our cultures. Some of you reading this may identify as Gullah/Geechee. Although I was born in Pennsylvania and raised away from that culture, my maternal family comes from Coastal South Carolina and Georgia. I’ve noticed, unfortunately, that someone made fun of people from that community, and to me, that’s disgraceful. Why do what others have done to us to each other?

If we are to take pride in our identities, we should recognize the contributions made to broader Black culture, even if we disagree. (Ex: Some words in AAVE have origins in the Gullah language) Yes, we are American, but we also maintain our African roots, with some groups like the Gullah and Geechee having a stronger connection. This heritage influences our speech, mannerisms, cuisine, worship, music, and for some of us even our clothing, which to me is something to celebrate.

I aimed to highlight this, though I didn’t do it well, and I’m committed to continuing my content creation.

I also made mistakes regarding national flags, which embarrasses me since I was defending them passionately. Black Americans have several flags that represent us, and here’s what I didn’t clarify in the video:

The first flag I showed was the Ghana flag, but it should have been the Pan-African flag (red, black, and green).

Here are the flags:

- The Black Heritage Flag: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_American_Heritage_Flag
- The Gullah Geechee Flag:   https://blackamericanmerch.com/products/bandanas-1 (I’m unsure how to share image links on iOS.)
- The Louisiana Creole Flag: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people

While many of us primarily speak AAVE, some also speak Gullah and other Black American creole languages.

I’ve seen discussions about the issues with presenting Black culture to a wider audience, especially to groups we might not get along with. I understand that we have tensions with other minority groups but should we hold everyone to the same standards? (Ex: If there are people of that group that doesn’t hate us, or should we still be wary?) I don't mean to offend by asking this.

Either way, I’m sorry for upsetting folks, I really didn’t mean to. Still, I urge everyone to respect one another. I also implore y’all to learn of your ancestry! For me, it was healing as this information was denied of us.

Edit: I’m also going to say that it wasn’t the best to put this info in a 35 sec video. (tiktok format)💀"

From the maker of the [Fragrance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oOaLGLpHy_aAj_JFkCk5aTBZo4mLqG61f7DxBLhE5Rs/edit?usp=sharing). Since I've been seeing a lot more posts here about dropshipped goods I wanted to make another one -- this time for fashion goods such as clothes, shoes and bags.

Character Voice In Fanfic ,FanFiction,1i6ol1u,2025-01-21 12:54:10,1,0.57,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1i6ol1u/character_voice_in_fanfic/,Intelligent_Hat7098,Discussion,"I'm referring to those who write for POC characters particularly those who are African American/ Caribbean.

Do you try to emulated the character’s voice in your writing?

Because sometimes I read fanfics and the character uses let's say AAVE in Canon but it is no where to be seen in the fanfic. Like not even a smidgen. 

Or like they say something that I'm like, ""Why would he say that in that way?""

Maybe a nitpick but it just thought."

Is Elias Lindholm really this mediocre?,Bruins,1i6obm1,2025-01-21 12:43:32,53,0.92,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bruins/comments/1i6obm1/is_elias_lindholm_really_this_mediocre/,ethereal3xp,Question,"And this is only his 1st season of his contract. Thats the scary part. 

We can state that maybe he and Marchand don't click well. But Lindholm also had a long look with Pasta. 

His play so far reminds me of Riley Nash.  A bottom 6 player that makes 3m AAV.  The basics are there but offensively.... seen very little.

- Not a great skater
- Not a great shot
- No stickhandling
- So so passing skills
- Not great along the boards/winning puck battles
- Nothing from the powerplay

For those that know his game better.  What seems to be the issue?
