"[Governance Poll Proposal] Establish the Donut DAO org; Decentralize, expand, and secure DONUT’s future beyond r/EthTrader",ethtrader,1i8smzx,2025-01-24 05:42:25,15,0.94,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8smzx/governance_poll_proposal_establish_the_donut_dao/,0xMarcAurel,Donut,"## TL;DR

This proposal is a huge step in shaping the future of the Donut ecosystem. It's about: 

1. Formally establishing Donut DAO as a decentralized, unregistered organization with the flexibility to grow beyond Reddit, allowing DONUT to continue to operate independently of any single subreddit or platform.
2. Transitioning DONUT’s structure to remove its dependency on r/EthTrader, making r/EthTrader as one arm of a broader organization.
3. Balancing the allocation of funds to create a more sustainable and equitable distribution model.
4. Clearly defining roles and responsibilities for Donut DAO contributors, while ensuring fair compensation for their efforts.
5. Optimizing leadership and governance by welcoming new contributors and reevaluating inactive roles (moderators, multisig guardians).

The objective is to create a robust foundation that supports growth, decentralization, and the sustainability of DONUT, while rewarding content creators, contributors and giving power to the community.

The focus of this organization is to give contributors opportunities to grow, connect with other interested individuals, build a professional portfolio, and receive compensation in the process. Thus, the Donut DAO would create an environment of mutual benefit and recognition for all participants.

---

## Current situation

For too long, the mod team has relied on a ""mint more DONUT whenever we run out"" approach. This may've worked 5 or 6 years ago, but it’s no longer effective considering DONUT is now a valued asset, subject to market mechanics. Also, with regulatory scrutiny increasing, it’s time we collectively reassess our current practices, formalize our policies / structure, and establish a more strategic approach to DONUT minting and allocation.

As a SocialFi token, DONUT’s primary purpose is to reward content creators and promote decentralized governance. To fulfill this mission, a dedicated team is essential. We need people responsible for maintaining operations, promoting growth, and investing on long-term sustainability.

This proposal is probably the most significant and complex initiative we have ever had as a DAO. Submitting dozens of individual proposals would be a lot more complex and would delay important progress. This is a consolidated proposal that reflects the collective insights of the mod team, and is the result of internal discussions and team calls. Our vision is to position DONUT as a project that goes beyond r/EthTrader, making sure its growth is not limited by the subreddit’s boundaries. In this structure, r/EthTrader will be a branch of a broader ecosystem, known as the Donut DAO (proposed below).

---

## Problem

We're going to be fully transparent with the community, the current structure and team reached a pivotal crossroads. Even though our project made significant progress, the current structure has shown limitations that could compromise growth, sustainability and even operations's maintenance.

Right now, there is formally no team or organization responsible for promoting DONUT. Technically it's the mod team and the community as a whole. While this flexibility worked in the early stages, it now creates uncertainty regarding the project's purpose, reach, and goals. What worked 6 years ago no longer works today, especially in the Web3 industry that changes by the day. To attract serious contributors and partnerships, establishing and formalizing a decentralized entity is important. Without this, we risk, once again, stagnation and missed opportunities to expand.

Another problem is the existing reward and funding structure. This model led to concerns about managing resources and a lack of reserves for future growth initiatives. If this issue is not addressed, this project will struggle to fund new and current contributors, attract talent, or even finance ecosystem expansion.

Yet another problem is, over time, some roles within the project (like moderators and multisig guardians) have become inactive or loosely defined. This creates inefficiencies in important decisions.

Additionally, the absence of clear and fair compensation made it very difficult to recruit and retain contributors, leaving gaps in operational capabilities. In other words: people aren't receiving enough rewards for the value and work they provide.

Finally, DONUT has huge potential as a project, but its current visibility is confined largely to this sub. This limits its audience and adoption, making it harder to grow and compete in the Web3 industry.

---

## Solution

The solution goes through different steps to evolve our project into a sustainable, decentralized organization while focusing on its future.

Here are the proposed measures:

**1 - Establishing Donut DAO**

We propose transitioning our entire project into (a new) Donut DAO, an official, (legally speaking) unregistered decentralized organization.

DONUT’s success should not be limited by one platform or subreddit. We should aim to create a structure that can operate independently of Reddit, enabling expansion into other platforms or even transitioning into a whole new token category if needed. This protects the project from external risks, like changes to Reddit’s policies or infrastructure. DONUT would continue to work and grow even without Reddit or r/EthTrader.

Under this new organization, r/EthTrader would still be a vital part of the ecosystem, but the Donut DAO would be the overarching organization, positioning itself for broader opportunities and long-term survival. Simply put, r/EthTrader would be one of the many branches of the Donut DAO.

**2 - Structuring Donut DAO**

Donut DAO would operate as a decentralized organization, but with a defined structure that promotes efficiency and collaboration. This would promote a more collaborative approach, while giving clarity on roles and responsibilities.

The proposed structure is as follows:

* Co-founders: Responsible for partnerships, overseeing operations, managing the treasury, handling administrative tasks, grants, and ensuring the organization’s overall direction.

Proposed co-founders:

Carl Larson: Original developer of the Reddit community points system (DONUT) and an early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Basoosh: Veteran DONUT contributor, developer, formerly responsible for monthly distributions and currently responsible for the Donut Dashboard.

Marc Aurel: Ecosystem growth lead, responsible for partnerships, networking, business, and operations.

* Developers: Focus on maintaining and scaling DONUT’s technical infrastructure, including websites, subreddit tools, and others.

* Content moderators: Responsible for subreddit (in this case, r/EthTrader) and Discord management, aiming to promote healthy community engagement.

* Art sector: Focus on creating art for advertising, partnerships, and campaigns.

* Community sector: Organizing events, giveaways, and supporting users directly.

**3 - Optimizing DONUT allocation**

We propose reallocating the monthly DONUT distribution to optimize fund management, support development, and, most importantly, make sure contributors are compensated fairly.

The new proposed monthly allocation is:

* Content creation (subreddit distribution) [NO CHANGES]: 850,000 DONUT

510,000 DONUT for posts.

340,000 DONUT for comments.

* Liquidity incentives: 450,000 DONUT

Uniswap (ETH/DONUT V2 on Ethereum) reduced from 400,000 to 250,000 DONUT.

Sushi (ETH/DONUT V3 on Arbitrum One) increased from 150,000 to 200,000 DONUT.

Even though Ethereum is extremely important when it comes to liquidity, our DeFi operations take place on Arbitrum One. As such, we should aim to promote liquidity on Arbitrum, also to help the DAO unlock the remaining funds from the Arbitrum Grant (7,500 ARB).

* Community contests: 25,000 DONUT.

Reduced from 50,000, as this expense is unfortunately not having the desired effect and is not as impactful given the funds provided.

* Moderation [CEASES TO EXIST] 

* Community treasury [CEASES TO EXIST]

* Donut DAO treasury: 415,000 DONUT, distributed as follows:

Developers: 30,000 DONUT/month (+ grants as needed).

Moderators: 15,000 DONUT/month.

Community (community contributors that are not moderators): 5,000 DONUT/month.

Art: Funded via grants based on project proposals.

After covering monthly expenses, there would be ~200,000 - 230,000 DONUT remaining, according to the current size of the team. These funds would be reserved for the art sector, additional grants, strategic investments, or any extra necessity. Also, there are additional operational costs such as the u/donut-bot server, among other small expenses.

Although 1,740,000 Donuts are available for distribution each month, as you can see the funds disappear almost instantly due to the treasury's expenses needed to finance operations.

**4 - Restructuring and optimizing mod sector and the multisig**

This is not easy to address, but it has to be done nonetheless. To ensure accountability, we propose the following contributor activity policy:

1 month of inactivity: Contributor is defunded.

3 months of inactivity: Contributor is removed from the organization. Rejoining is an option if the contributor becomes active again in the future.

We propose this policy to promote fairness, because funds allocated to inactive members could be redirected to active contributors or other strategic initiatives. We recommend removing inactive members due to sensitive information about the project and to maintain the integrity of our work. Active contributors are important for progress and internal decisions, and people who are inactive can disrupt ongoing efforts. Internal decisions are made democratically, and inactive members who don’t vote can unintentionally stall progress.

As for multisig guardians, members inactive for 3+ months would also be removed, to make sure the treasury is protected by individuals who are actively involved and aware of ecosystem developments. The multisig must always have a minimum of five active guardians to maintain security and decentralization.  In the future, potential guardians may be added, provided that they gained the trust of the organization and the community as a whole.

**5 - Immediate goals if this proposal passes**

If this proposal is approved, the following topics would be addressed immediately:

* Build an official Donut DAO website, a dedicated platform to communicate the Donut DAO’s mission, goals, and updates. It would be separate from the Donut Dashboard.
* Create an official X account to promote DONUT and engage in marketing campaigns.
* Assign roles and responsibilities to make sure all teams are ready and equipped to contribute effectively.
* Host monthly meetings to regularly assess progress and adjust strategies. *A future idea is to allow DONUT whales to attend meetings.*
* Post monthly treasury flow reports. This includes expenses and inflows, to promote transparency and trust.

---

## Advantages

* Establishes a professional and organized structure, incrasing credibility and trust among users and potential partners.
* Enables strategic fund management, protecting the sustainability and efficiency of operations.
* Creates a self sustaining economy with DONUT as its foundation.
* Promotes fair compensation for contributors, based on their skills, efforts, and activity levels.
* Further increases decentralization by involving more contributors from different locations, promoting a more global perspective.
* Simplifies internal conflict resolution, particularly in cases of inactivity or disagreement, with clear policies in place.
* Distributes responsibilities and tasks efficiently, reducing the burden on individual contributors. Contributors can focus on their specific roles, for example devs will no longer need to moderate content and can focus on building instead.
* Ensures long term operations by reducing dependency on any single individual within the organization.
* Supports expansion beyond Reddit, making Reddit a vital branch of the broader Donut ecosystem, rather than it's pillar.
* Builds a foundation for growth, including potential integration into other social platforms or use cases.
* Promotes collaboration and transparency through a clearly defined structure and regular reporting.

## Disadvantages

* The proposed structure introduces high complexity, which could lead to overly bureaucratic processes.
* Contributors would have personal responsibility for legal and tax-related matters, which may create challenges depending on their location.
* Requires a lot of effort and coordination to establish the organization, onboard new contributors, and maintain communication between sectors.

---

## Conclusion

This proposal would create a path for DONUT to evolve into a resilient, decentralized organization capable of thriving in any scenario. If we transition to the proposed Donut DAO, we will make sure that DONUT is no longer tied to a single platform, allowing it to expand, adapt, and grow in new directions. It also creates a framework for long term sustainability through structured roles, decentralized decisions, and transparent operations.

There's one important thing to note. Without this proposal, there’s a huge risk that current challenges lead to reduced activity or disruptions to basic functions like distributions and the maintenance of donut-bot, and even abandonment. This means people leaving the project. We should practically acknowledge the risks we're facing right now and understand the consequences if proactive measures aren’t taken.

Just like everything, there are challenges involved. However, the benefits really outweigh the risks. This initiative would secure DONUT’s future.

If the community supports this proposal, we can build a robust, scalable ecosystem where DONUT continues to thrive regardless of individual or platform changes. Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions to change or add to this proposal.

In the simplest terms, crossing the $100 billion swap volume threshold on Uniswap means that the total value of all transactions executed through Base on the Uniswap protocol has surpassed $100b.

The first Layer 2 to achieve this feat was Arbitrum. Base now joining the $100b+ club is a clear indication that L2s are being increasingly adopted for blockchain scalability, cheaper transaction costs and smoother user experience for DeFi interactions.

Many will say one of the unique advantages Base has is its backing by Coinbase which offers significant incentives to developers and builders.

However, it would be unfair to attribute Base's success solely to Coinbase's backing considering we've seen initiatives like Coinbase NFT not achieve the same level of success.

A significant portion of the credit should go to Jesse Pollak who serves as the head of protocols at Coinbase and is deeply involved in the Base project. From the time Base was announced, Jesse has been religious with sharing messages about the potential of the onchain economy to drive global economic prosperity.

He actively highlights new projects on Base, tests them out, encourages development on the platform, and engages deeply with the community. Consequently Base's success is organic, achieved without traditional promotional strategies like tap-to-earn, TVL programs or airdrop initiatives.

Beyond its performance on Uniswap, Base continues to make waves in the broader blockchain space. It currently ranks as the [6th largest chain by Total Value Locked (TVL)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains), surpassing ARB, AVAX and MATIC, and is quickly catching up to SOL. 

In terms of DEX volume, Base stands as the [3rd largest chain](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains), often matching the activity levels of Ethereum's mainnet and reaching 40% of Solana's volume."
Help needed - MOON delisted from crypto.com,CryptoCurrency,1i1a2sm,2025-01-14 11:34:57,0,0.4,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i1a2sm/help_needed_moon_delisted_from_cryptocom/,Tatky,:moons: MOONS,"Hey Guys, getting desperate here...

Tried a lot of things (list at the end)

I missed an apparently important mail from [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) that told me 7 days ago they were gonna delist MOON for whatever reason...

They didn't tell me why. Maybe anyone got insights on that too? couldn't find anything on here either...

Now I am facing the problem, that I can't sell nor buy MOON anymore. Made decent profits in NOV/DEC but still have 1000+ MOON.  
What platforms still trade it? I could only find Coinbase so far.

I need to transfer it somewhere but don't know where... Any ideas?  
I don't know many platforms tbh. [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and Kraken both don't trade moon (anymore)

how do you guys trade moon?

Thanks in advance :)

\---------------------------

Here is what I have tried so far:

The obvious step would be to send the crypto to another platform. However for whatever stupid reason [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) only allows to send it using ""Arbitrum Nova"".

Finding platforms that support it is nearly impossible. The only thing I found after a suggestion was ""Meta Mask""  
However it's not possible to trade MOON there either.

So trying with coinbase seems to be the only way. Sadly, coinbase can't work with Arbitrum Nova

  
Tried sending it anyway and just provided the wallet address and linked a wallet in the [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) app, but the 1 MOON I sent disappeared into the void.

Also tried with the Meta Mask Wallet. Again, coin disappeared into the void.

  
The [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) support was 0 help either. Just stating there was a mail and the only way to transfer it is Arbitrum Nova

  
It seems the only possible way to send MOON to anywhere is ARB to Coinbase.

Any other suggestions that I haven't found yet?"

* This graph showcases the share price of Coinbase, one of the biggest crypto related businesses and a benchmark for analyzing “big money” in crypto + related to today’s news!

**Ethereum and Layer 2 Highlights**

**Ethereum Mainnet**

* **Coinbase vs SEC Lawsuit Paused**: A U.S. judge agreed to let Coinbase appeal an important decision in its case with the SEC, putting the case on hold for now. The appeal will focus on whether the crypto assets involved count as ""investment contracts"" under securities laws. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, accusing it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency - likely, this will be an important case for the future of centralized exchanges.
* **AAVE Celebrates 5 Years**: Aave, the leading lending protocol, turned five today. Well, most likely yesterday depending on when you’re reading. Launched on January 8, 2020, it helped start DeFi Summer and grew into the biggest DeFi platform, with over $34 billion in total value locked, 13 markets, and 2.3 million users across 11 networks. Aave is now preparing to launch Aave V4 later this year.

**Arbitrum**

* **Lotte Group Partnership**: South Korea's Lotte Group has chosen Arbitrum's blockchain to develop its Lotte Caliverse, aiming to enhance Web3 entertainment experiences. Let’s see how this will pan out for the growing web3 gaming market.

**Optimism**

* **OP Price Update**: Optimism's token, OP, is trading around $2.12, with recent price fluctuations between $2.06 and $2.18. It looks like it won’t break out of here anytime soon.

**Polygon**

* **Kraken's Layer 2 Solution**: In October 2024, Kraken announced 'Ink,' a new Ethereum Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain, with its testnet expected to go live soon.
* **DIA's Lumina Testnet**: In November 2024, DIA launched the testnet for Lumina, a modular oracle designed to enhance transparency and integration, utilizing an OP stack-based Optimism solution.

Both of these products are expected to go out soon, so let’s keep an eye on them!

**Project of the Day**

**Project of the Day: Auditchain's** [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai)

**Overview:** Auditchain has rolled out [**Pacioli.ai**](http://Pacioli.ai), a cutting-edge decentralized platform that merges blockchain and AI to elevate financial, sustainability, and crypto asset disclosures. It’s built to provide real-time validation of financial statements and control sets, introducing a fresh era of continuous auditing. This project is geared toward tackling the pain points of traditional financial reporting by integrating transparency and trust into the system.

**Significance:**

* **Regulatory Compliance:** [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) is designed to help organizations navigate the complexities of regulatory reporting with precision. This, obviously, boosts reliability in financial disclosures.
* **Support for Traditional Formats:** The platform supports machine-readable formats like XBRL and JSON, meaning it’ll be useable by most traditional accountants.
* **Incentivized Ecosystem:** With a built-in payment and rewards system using USDC, [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) incentivizes users to contribute to high-quality control sets, making the ecosystem collaborative and self-sustaining.

**Recent Update:** As of 2024, Auditchain deployed [Pacioli.ai](http://Pacioli.ai) on the mainnet, marking a milestone as the first blockchain-based **Regulatory Finance (RegFi)** protocol. This move bridges the gap between traditional financial frameworks and decentralized technologies, bringing millions of annual disclosures on-chain and setting a new standard for automated compliance.

\[TLDR because I made it quite blocky and long - it’s a super good product for finance professionals who want to get into blockchain.\]

**Key Takeaways**

**Ethereum Ecosystem**

* **Regulatory Landscape:** The approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a significant political issue. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin anticipates that several Ether ETF applications will receive approval, though he expects a lengthy wait before they become public. This development underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets - while multiple ETH ETFs have been launched yet, there’s still quite a few to go.
* **Research and Development:** In a notable development, Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer following a controversy. This event highlights the let’s say dynamic nature of the Ethereum development community and the challenges it faces in governance and collaboration\*\*.\*\* 

**Layer 2 Narrative**

* **Berachain's Unique Consensus:** Berachain is introducing Proof of Liquidity to enhance Ethereum’s scalability while maintaining decentralization and reducing energy consumption. This modern, fairly innovative approach targets both Ethereum’s transaction throughput and environmental concerns.
* **Ink Chain Mainnet Launch:** Built on the Optimism Superchain (which we’ve covered before!), Ink Chain launched its mainnet ahead of schedule, marking a significant milestone for their future ecosystem
* **Airdrop Anticipation:** Upcoming Berachain and Linea Protocol airdrops are sparking excitement in the community, with both projects contributing to the growing innovation (though also to the complexity) of Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum. These airdrops will obviously increase user engagement and strengthen their respective ecosystems. Which is good.

**Quick Stats**

Arbitrum keep growing but why the price declined?,ethtrader,1hsc306,2025-01-02 21:43:29,9,0.91,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hsc306/arbitrum_keep_growing_but_why_the_price_declined/,Creative_Ad7831,Technicals," Crypto market is heavily influenced by whales and/or institutions due to they hold majority or listed as the top holders of a crypto project. The same principle also applied to ARB. Based on [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances), ARB foundation treasury hold 2,853,630,032.237418147357559551 ARB or 28.5363% of ARB total supply (as of 3 January 2025) and the rest of the tokens are held by publics or institutions.

Many altcoins have been performed well in 2024, except ARB. according to Coingecko, over the year ARB down by 57,1%, down by 27,6% in the last 30 days, down by 2,3% in the last 14 days and slightly up by 1,7% in the last 7 days and up by 1,8% in the last 24 hours. But what was the reason why ARB has been underperformed in 2024? There were 2 reasons:

**Monthly token unlocks**

According to [https://cryptorank.io/price/arbitrum/vesting](https://cryptorank.io/price/arbitrum/vesting), ARB constantly unlocking 92.63M tokens (0.93% of Total Supply) in every month that worth approximately $ 71.46M (2.21% of Market Cap) of total supply of 10 billion tokens. The monthly token unlock is distributed to team and advisors by 2.08% (56.12M tokens) and investors 2.08% (36.51M tokens). Currently, ARB supply is 3.22B tokens unlocked by 32.2%.

**Whales constantly sold their assets**

I did research and found out that whales or institutions played big role in ARB price being down for a whole year. So, I stalked 3 whales as a sample and found out that all of them moved their assets to CEXs and brought huge impact to price action. If whales moving their assets, it will create FUD and uncertainty in crypto market as many media will spread this information through news and some small investors of weak hands will respond by selling their assets. In the end, the price of ARB will keep going down. Here are the 3 whale address that I used as research to determine ARB price action:

 

**Whale #1**

wallet address 0x.....................................................................ceC

the first whale holds 480,000,000 ARB or 4,8% of ARB total supply. He/she only moved his assets to Binance 37 days ago worth of $70,644,138.35 million for 91,667,062 ARB

at that time, ARB was on a gradual pump and even hit $0,96. People will hope that ARB will once again hit $1 but this action made ARB down to $0,84 on 27 November. Thankfully, the market remain calm and the pump lasted until 7 December and ARB was traded at $1,23. 

**Whale #2**

wallet address 0xf..................................................................E26

this whale holds 271,913,734 ARB or 2.7191% of ARB total supply and constantly moved his/her ARB to upbit in 27 transactions over the last 30 days for total amount of money approximately $49.192.154

Those actions affected badly to ARB because at the start of December 2024, ARB was traded at around $2 and it even down to $0,6 on 20 December 2024. For the rest of December, ARB was traded at the range of $0,7.

**Whale #3**

wallet address 0x62............................................................BBE6

The third whale hold 103,528,790 ARB or 1.0353% of ARB total supply and constantly put his/her asset to [gate.io](http://gate.io) in total of 8 transactions as follows:

23 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,105,216 ARB worth of approximately $884,017

29 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 930,146 ARB worth of approximately $710,321

52 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,541,782 ARB worth of approximately $1,177,408

139 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,866,019 ARB worth of approximately $1,425,017

162 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,291,489 ARB worth of approximately $986,267

181 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,720,874 ARB worth of approximately $1,314,174

226 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 874,125 ARB worth of approximately $667,541

233 days ago to [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) for 1,014,713 ARB worth of approximately $774,903

  
If we take a look at the information above, the whale moved his/her assets exactly 52 days ago and it resulted ARB to going down to $0,57 on 13 November 2024.

On 25 July 2024, the whale moved 1,291,489 ARB to CEX and resulted to ARB kept going down all the way from $0,74 to $0,48 on 6 August 2024. Since then, ARB struggled to pump and traded at the range of $0,48 to 0,59 before broke to $0,6 support on 23 September 2024.

I believe that whales are also did the same thing in 2023 as we can see that the same pattern happened that severely impact the market, for example:

1 June 2023 $1,17 down to $0,94 on 15 June 2023

1 September 2023 $0,915 down to $0,76 on 12 September 2023

2 October 2023 $0,97 down to $0,769 on 20 October 2023

But, we might be able to see short-lived pump in 2025 as it happened twice. First, it happened on 21 December 2023 to 12 January 2024, as ARB pumped from $1,15 to $2,2 and since then the price has been consolidated at the range of $1,7 to $2,1. After that, ARB kept declining until it hit another low resistance at $0,48 in August 2023. Second rally started on 5 November 2024 $0,45 and gradually pumped to $1,18 on 7 December 2024.

 

In conclusion, ARB may hit another rough patch in early 2025 if some whales are moving their assets to CEXs and we may see ARB dumps in price to the range of $0,5-$0,6, especially if there are whales that actively selling their assets like whales #2. But ARB also has potential to pump from $1 to $2 if Trump inauguration initiates crypto rally or if FED decides to make significant interest rate cut in 2025."

The development comes just weeks after ARB became the first L2 to break the $20 billion barrier on Uniswap as reported by [Coinrepublic](https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/12/04/arbitrum-becomes-the-first-l2-to-hit-20b-on-uniswap/).

It is worthwhile to note that this milestone isn't just about volume, it's a sign of Arbitrum's growing integration with Ethereum's infrastructure. 

Did you know that with this kind of volume, Arbitrum is actually contributing to the decentralization of Ethereum's transaction validation? 

By offloading transactions from the mainnet, it's reducing the hardware requirements for node operators, making Ethereum more accessible and decentralized, which is a core principle often overlooked in the excitement of high volumes.

And here's an interesting twist: with this consistent rise in volume, Arbitrum is in a prime position to reclaim its title as the king of L2s from BASE. 

While BASE has been enjoying its time in the spotlight, Arbitrum's stealthily increasing volume indicates a growing strong user base, developer confidence, speculative trading, liquidity incentives, and broader market dynamics which build the Total Value Locked (TVL) necessary for a flippening.

 How bullish are you on ARB after this impressive volume milestone? Let's hear your predictions and thoughts!"

"About ""How to invest my stablecoins fortune?"" posts on this sub",defi,1hns8yc,2024-12-27 18:35:44,34,0.94,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1hns8yc/about_how_to_invest_my_stablecoins_fortune_posts/,Carbone_,:discuss: Discussion,"Hi, 

I love this community, but still I am a bit surprised by many answers below posts like ""how to invest hundreds of thousands stablecoins"" that we see so often.

I may be wrong but I think many people are looking for a secured optimal diversification strategy rather than advice like: ""invest in this pool, it rocks and it has a good APY"", or: ""AAVE is reliable"".

The result is that the answers might be frustrating for investors, and they look ""spammy"" or even like hidden ads, despite true most of the time, and despite the good spirit of the sub and the good will of participants.

Myself, like many others, I have the same issue. I want an optimized diversification of my assets. In TradFi communities, when you ask for recommendations, no one will answer: ""invest in this stock option"". It will be more high-level, more strategic advice, like 60% of stocks and 30% of bonds and 10% of Gold"" (this is just an example), with underlying details.

If I take my case, I'm currently scraching my head to define a good strategy. Until now, I made the following statements in my head:

1. With a risk based approach, it's out of question to put everything on AAVE (or another single protocol), a single chain or a single stablecoin. Doing that would be the opposite of my diversification requirements.

2. Investing on L2 Eth chains could be part of the strategy, but only to grab some additional APY% or to average the whole Ethereum APYs. Otherwise, this is perfectly useless for big amounts as the impact of Ethereum fees are neglictible.

3. Unfortunately, this is really not clear to me that L2 chains provide more profitability. I made some charts to compare AAVE pools of stablecoins on Ethereum and on other chains like ARB or OP, and the difference over time seems minimal.

4. L2 chains induces an additional risk which is actually not really rewarded correctly except by the fees. For an average investor, the added value is limited in my opinion.

5. Currently, my diversification strategy is focused on 5 protocols (AAVE, Compound, Kamino, JustLend, USUAL), 5 L1 chains (Eth, Polygon, Solana, Tron, BSC) and 6 stablecoins (USDT, USDC, USDE, PYUSD, USDS, USD0++). I still include some L2 chains to soften the volatility of the APY of Ethereum pools.

6. In total, I selected 24 pools, 5 L1 chains, and 6 stablecoins to implement my strategy. But now I am scratching my head to decide the percentage allocated to each component, especially for L2 chains. Considering pools on L2 chains as L1 chains would over-expose me to Ethereum. 

7. Intuitively, the DeFI ecosystem is an oriented-graph with a lot of dependencies, where you have to decide an allocation on each node to ensure diversification. It's really tricky. For instance, Arbitrum depends of Ethereum, but AAVE too if I'm not wrong. The AAVE token is an ERC20 token, and it is used as a safety fund for lenders. So, if you lend either on AAVE or an L2, you are under the direct exposure of Ethereum, in addition to Arbitrum and AAVE. 

8. Despite its complexity, I still think such an optimal allocation could be done. 

So... I'm a bit puzzled and surprised not to see ""detailed analysis"" at the level of TradFi. I don't know if I over-complexify DeFi or if it's a question of maturity. I just know it's my money, and that at a certain level of stablecoins (which are in themselves the consequence of a diversification strategy), I think that many people are looking for a deeper analysis with a risk and diversification approach. I may be wrong, this is just what I felt reading this sub since a few months. 

Let me know your thoughts!

Whales are out here making moves like they’ve got a secret VIP party invitation 🎉👀. Let’s break it down for you:

🐳 Big wallets are making splashes with $ENA and $ARB! Over 36.65M Ethena and 40M Arbitrum have been scooped up this week, and ENA is holding strong with a consistent upswing. Meanwhile, ARB seems to have missed leg day and keeps struggling to flex 💪😂.

On the flip side... drama incoming! 🚨 $POL is in the hot seat, with whales dumping 80M MATIC in the last 48 hours. Someone hand $POL some tissues because it’s sliding harder than my DMs on a Friday night 📉😢. The price might face a further drop, but if it holds the $0.49–$0.51 zone, it could snap back and slay again!  

Moral of the story: Whales are unpredictable, kinda like me when I see a sale on stilettos 🫦. Keep your eyes on $BTC, $ETH, and ofc, the future star of them all... $YOI!

✨ Altcoin season is calling. Are you picking up? ✨

5 Token Unlocks to Watch Next Week,Blockmandev,1hfg5t4,2024-12-16 05:23:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1hfg5t4/5_token_unlocks_to_watch_next_week/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Token unlock season is upon us, and the market is bracing for some major moves next week as big-name projects release previously restricted tokens. Let's dive into the highlights.  

Cardano is set to unlock 18.53M ADA on December 16. Known for its sustainable and scalable tech, this allocation will go toward staking and treasury funding. Will this fuel new ADA adoption, or will it test the market's resilience?  

On the same day, Arbitrum will unleash 92.65M ARB from its ecosystem, valued at a jaw-dropping $91M. With allocations aimed at investors, the team, and advisors, Ethereum's popular Layer-2 solution might just be setting the stage for something big.  

ApeCoin joins the party on December 17 with a 15.60M APE unlock. Historically, APE often sees price jitters after large releases, but the rising buzz around NFTs could potentially soften the impact this time.  

December 18 brings Ethena into the spotlight as it plans to release 12.86M ENA. This synthetic currency protocol aims to expand its ecosystem with this sizable unlock, further shaping the future of decentralized finance.  

Finally, keep an eye on Space ID as it drops 78.49M ID tokens on December 22. With its mission to unify decentralized identities across blockchains, this unlock could signal significant protocol activity.  

These unlocks represent over $270M in value. Traders, strategists, and crypto enthusiasts—stay sharp! Timing and monitoring will be everything next week.

Instead, I sent it to the same public address (0x3845....), but to Ethereum BSC (Binance Smart Chain). The BSC address, including BEP-20, start with (0x7BE1).

If the ARB and BSC private keys for public address (0x3845....) are the same, then I should be able to recover the ETH. But how do I obtain the keys, please?"
PSA : MOONs are stronger than ever,CryptoCurrency,1h8rpvw,2024-12-07 07:44:36,0,0.46,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h8rpvw/psa_moons_are_stronger_than_ever/,IlIlllIIllllIIlI,:moons: MOONS,"Hi everyone ! Since the daily isn’t really the best place for long posts, I’m here to make a recap on MOONs, what it is and why you should be bullish about it. While this is obviously quite a shill, I’m also willing to make it a public service announcement for the newcomers and crypto beginners on this sub.

#What are MOONs ?

First of all, it’s a Governance Token for this sub. Formerly created and minted monthly by Reddit included in their RCP (Reddit Community Points) program. 

The project has been sunset since then, and the contract has been renounced, making it a truely community owned token. Thanks to the mods and community members, a DAO was formed and all the usecases in place have been revived (banner renting, distributions, tipping, etc.)

Two major things changed with this event :
- No one can mint MOON anymore, the supply is hard capped and deflationnary
- The future of the project is in the hands of its community, no one is « in charge ».

#You can earn MOONs…

**Governance**

Because it’s a governance token, participating in the sub’s activity rewards you some, according to your monthly earned Karma. The tokens will be sent directly to you if you have a registered wallet.

**Tips**

You can also tip them to other users as a reward for informative or useful contributions, right in the comments using the tipbot command.

**Voting**

Your holdings will reflect the weight of your votes in the monthly CCIP proposals made to change the rules of this sub and the economy surrounding it.

#… or you can buy them !

Buy them, what for ? You may ask. Well, because you can ! This part is more dedicated to gamblers and people that believe in the evergrowing economy of this sub. Remember this is a high risk asset, no one knows what the future is made of and you could lose it all. Never invest more than you’ll be confortable losing.

# Where can I buy MOON ?

There are a few ways to buy some, from easy to more advanced.

**CEXs : the easy way**

The easiest way is to grab some with $ or € is centralized exchanges like Kraken (our official partner) and Crypto .com

**DEXs : more advanced users**

For the DeFi adventurers, you’ll have to use either Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova networks.
MOON is paired with ETH on DEXs :
- Camelot (Arb One)
- SushiSwap (Arb Nova)

# What are the usecases of MOON ?

**Adertising**

MOON is the heart of this sub’s economy. The main usecase is advertising. Companies, brands and projects can rent the banner, book AMAs and giveways, sponsored events.

These events are paid in MOON that are, once bought by the renters, sent to the burn wallet. This creates scarcity, these tokens will disapear forever.

**DAO**

MOON is also used to vote for the rules and changes made to the sub (eg. discussing rent prices, new partnerships, etc.)

**Education**

It’s a good way to learn and make baby steps in the DeFi world. Since you’re getting rewarded MOON for your contributions, learning the process of managing and securing a wallet, sending and receiving tokens, bridging them, selling and buying them come along your DeFi journey at litterally no cost. It’s a free tutorial on what crypto is all about :
decentralization and self-custody.

# FAQ

This part is a non exhaustive list of questions I see in the daily that may help you catch up.

**Are MOONs still a thing ?**

Yes ! If you’ve read this far, I hope you get it. You’ll be able to follow the ventures of this project on r/cryptocurrencymeta and r/cryptocurrencymoons

**Are Distributions going on again?**

Yes ! After the sunset, distribution stopped for a time but has been revived thanks to the community. All you have to do is create a vault or a fresh new wallet and register your address with the bot to start earning monthly.

**Are there guides to learn more?**

Yes, you’ll find everything you need in this sub Wiki, but also the other dedicated subs mentionned above.

On a sidenote, I’m working on writing simple and explicit guides for setting up a wallet, registering for distributions, learn more about the tokenomics, how to sell and buy. Stay tuned.

**Will MOON reach $1?**

While no one can predict anything, here are some metrics to put it into perspective :

Right now MOONs are traded at around $0.21 with a Market Cap of roughly $18M. The hard capped supply of 80M tokens (after sunset) is burning at a fast pace, getting smaller everytime the banner is rented, or an AMA is hosted. Reaching $1 is x5 from now, and would make it a Top500 token by Market Cap which is already ridiculously low. A lot of memecoins without any utility go beyond $100M MC within a few days.

**What makes you bullish about MOON?**

Absolutely everything about it. Not only it has proved to be a great governance tool with great usecases, a well decentralized distribution, its meme potential is insane. This ticker is litterally MOON.

AI Meme Coin KiboShib $KIBSHI - First-Ever Meme Coin Generated by AI (2022),BSCIDOLAUNCHER,1h8hhby,2024-12-06 20:37:49,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSCIDOLAUNCHER/comments/1h8hhby/ai_meme_coin_kiboshib_kibshi_firstever_meme_coin/,Rexythesol,,"Meet the first AI-generated meme coin, KiboShib. Every element—logo, ticker, name, description, and concept—was crafted by ChatGPT (first advanced public AI model), making it truly unique. Launched on December 8, 2022, KiboShib is the first AI meme coin in existence!

* **Fair Launch:** Inspired by SHIB’s model, KiboShib’s distribution was straightforward and transparent:
   * **50%** of tokens were sent to Vitalik's wallet (sold in summer 2023, with the dip quickly bought up).
   * **50%** were added to a Uniswap liquidity pool, with the LP locked.
* **Fixed Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000 KIBSHI tokens
* **Organic Growth:** Fully organic meme coin with no insiders or KOLs. Backed by non-GMO a vibrant and growing community.
* **Narrative:** Leading the AI + meme coin trend, with nearly two years in the market!

With memes thriving, more people are bound to look for the next big meme coin. KiboShib’s distinction as the first AI-generated meme coin makes it a standout choice.

Just search: *“first AI meme coin”* on Google, or ask AI like GrokAI (twitter), ChatGPT (paid), Bing Search AI, Llama (instagram), Perplexity AI - *""do a research and tell me what's the first AI meme coin""*

**Thesis:**

Humanity is entering the AI age. Meme coins are here to stay. Many people will look for the very first AI-generated meme coin as it is a historical artifact. And KiboShib has a cute AI-generated logo, also first fully AI made logo used by the real project.

Massive Altcoin Unlocks in December: Hold Onto Your Bags,WhiteRhinoMarketWatch,1h6tsab,2024-12-04 17:53:04,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRhinoMarketWatch/comments/1h6tsab/massive_altcoin_unlocks_in_december_hold_onto/,MrsSOsbourne,,"December’s shaping up to be a wild ride in the crypto world with some *serious* token unlocks coming our way. If you’re holding these coins, or just love watching the chaos unfold, here’s what’s about to hit the market:

▫️ **#IMX** \- $28.61M: Not earth-shattering, but enough to ripple through the NFT space.  
▫️ **#JTO** \- $531M: This one? Big. The kind of unlock that makes whales grin and retail traders panic.  
▫️ **#GMT** \- $20.7M: A modest unlock for your favorite ""move-to-earn"" ecosystem.  
▫️ **#ENS** \- $38.25M: Web3 naming rights are getting a payday.  
▫️ **#APT** \- $153M: Aptos holders better buckle up. That's a *lot* of new supply.  
▫️ **#ARB** \- $90M: Arbitrum’s still riding its Layer-2 hype wave, but $90M unlocked is no joke.  
▫️ **#ZETA** \- $283.22M: This? Monster unlock. Keep an eye on how the market digests it.  
▫️ **#OP** \- $79.89M: Optimism lives up to its name, but how optimistic will traders feel after this unlock?

Here’s the thing: Token unlocks can play havoc with prices, especially if big holders decide to dump. It’s not *always* bad news — depends on how the market absorbs the supply — but don’t be the one caught without a strategy. Keep your eyes on these unlocks, and maybe, just maybe, keep a little dry powder on the side.

Timing is everything, and in December, the clock is ticking for these altcoins.

Crypto Investment Weekly (Issue #2): ETH Advancing to daa MOOOONNN,MakeWalletFatAgain,1h6eh5z,2024-12-04 07:07:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeWalletFatAgain/comments/1h6eh5z/crypto_investment_weekly_issue_2_eth_advancing_to/,AdministrationHot443,,"This article was written on the afternoon of November 30, 2024.

Alt Bull Run is Here!

Hello everyone, I’m FatBro—a seasoned investor dedicated to “making wallets fat.” Welcome to the second issue of my crypto investment weekly.

We’ve finally arrived at a full-scale resurgence of the Ethereum ecosystem—an absolutely vibrant and energetic week. Over the past week, the leading projects within the Ethereum ecosystem experienced significant gains. Judging by the data from Ethereum ETFs and stablecoin issuance, it’s evident that capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem are both pronounced and resolute. Looking at the inflow-outflow data, an interesting phenomenon stands out this week: the capital inflow into Ethereum and the Base ecosystem far surpassed other ecosystems, approximately four times that of Solana. This signals that Ethereum’s counteroffensive is well underway.

https://preview.redd.it/srux2qjaqt4e1.png?width=2984&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d2c06d16fbb4a8a806efb0398c3321f7496a217

let’s first review last week’s recommendations and their actual results.

**Review of Last Week’s Predictions**

In the last issue of this weekly, we made the following key predictions and suggestions:

**1. ETH Performance Expectations**

**Prediction Last Week:**

ETH was expected to perform well in the new week, with a potential catch-up rally. It was recommended to shift part of BTC holdings to ETH.

**Actual Results:**

In the past week, after hitting a new high, BTC paused its upward momentum. ETH/BTC rebounded significantly after bottoming out, with ETH recording a notable weekly gain. I believe ETH still has room to outperform BTC in the coming period, although it might not happen immediately. Meanwhile, BTC also has the potential to break new highs. This creates a tug-of-war scenario with fluctuations. If your portfolio lacks sufficient allocation to major coins, it might be a good idea to liquidate some of your highly profitable MEME and altcoins to set up an ETH/WBTC grid strategy. This approach not only locks in profits and rebalances your portfolio but also allows you to gain enhanced returns from the grid strategy.

https://preview.redd.it/0frecj82qt4e1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=e08ed42562e74d92db13cf8d57ead6d6ec92d92e

**Knowledge on Portfolio Rebalancing**

When establishing your investment style, you’ve likely considered the concept of portfolio rebalancing. However, many people may not realize its importance. Portfolio rebalancing is an investment strategy used to adjust the proportions of different asset classes in your portfolio, aligning them with your initial target allocation. These proportions depend on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market expectations.

For instance, you might set the ratio of major coins to altcoins at 70% and 30%. When major coins rise by 30% while altcoins remain unchanged, you could sell 21% of your major coins and buy 21% more altcoins, restoring the 70%-30% ratio. This rebalancing process prompts you to evaluate whether the proportions of asset classes in your portfolio are reasonable and whether adjustments are necessary.

Of course, you can establish more complex relationships, such as allocations for BTC, ETH ecosystems, second-tier blockchains, altcoins, MEME coins, AI projects, and so on. If you have other investments, such as bonds, stocks, or real estate, you can also set proportions between these assets and cryptocurrencies to better control risks and optimize returns.

**2. High-Profit Asset Strategy Suggestions**

**Suggestion Last Week:**

Adopt a neutral ±20% grid strategy for profitable assets.

**Actual Results:**

For me, this asset was **Pendle**, which fluctuated within the 5-6 range throughout the week. My 40-day strategy, generating $5,500 in profits, continues to deliver returns. I’m also pleased to see this strategy featured on [DeGate’s](https://app.degate.com/?utm_source=fatbro_1_Reddit) recommended strategies leaderboard. However, in this round of Ethereum ecosystem gains, Pendle’s rise has been relatively modest. While it remains an excellent asset for grid trading, I’m considering rebalancing my spot holdings once it breaks above 6, reallocating them to other assets. I look forward to sharing the results of these actions with you next week.

https://preview.redd.it/hthj3284qt4e1.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57065606c8b498d246c458579d6a593e9c4e46c6

**3. Special Recommendations**

**Suggestion Last Week:**

1) **Puffer** (Buy recommendation at $0.28)

**Actual Results:**

Luck was definitely on our side. After buying in at $0.28, the **Based Rollup** sector began gaining traction in the market. Midweek, it even got listed on a Korean exchange, with the price soaring to a high of $0.7. I executed several swing trades and grid strategies during this period, achieving an overall return of approximately 3x for the week.

I’ve already taken out my initial investment and currently hold one-third of my position. Moving forward, part of it will continue with grid trading, while the rest is set at around $1, awaiting a potential second surge. I remain optimistic about the long-term development of Based Rollup and see an additional opportunity in Puffer being one of the Binance Lab-invested projects that has yet to list on Binance.

https://preview.redd.it/y7sg9p08qt4e1.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f67be3e4dd34689276e84d6738790bf2c4b951a7

https://preview.redd.it/tv1o5xn8qt4e1.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=b903c4afcc4fa41adaa0242d6df1e12feffcb87b

2) **LDO**

**Suggestion Last Week:**

LDO (-15% to +30% grid strategy recommendation)

**Actual Results:**

My LDO grid successfully broke out of its initial range this week, meaning the original grid strategy is no longer generating returns. However, since I started building the position at $1.1, the grid profits generated during this time have been consistently reinvested into LDO. As a result, I accumulated over 4,000 LDO tokens and have now set up a new “sell high” grid strategy.

The policy and fundamentals of LDO remain unchanged, so I continue to hold both spot positions and maintain an active grid trading strategy for this asset.

**Market Outlook for Next Week**

The Ethereum ecosystem is very likely to steal the spotlight. On the last half-day trading session of November during Thanksgiving, the ETF inflows were astonishing, reaching an unprecedented $332 million. Traditional funds clearly can’t hold back any longer. If the Ethereum ecosystem continues to show strength next week, its leading projects and Layer 2 solutions are expected to perform well.

https://preview.redd.it/78kvs0agqt4e1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1dbb6b9ec3e9df37064bcd2abd6e82a2a18761

Following last week’s recommendation of the Based Rollup sector, today I’d like to introduce another potentially undervalued sector: **ZK Stack**. As we all know, in Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem, projects built on **Op Stack** and **Arbitrum Stack** dominate most of the TVL and user base. However, ZK Stack, representing an alternative technical route within the Ethereum ecosystem, remains at a relatively low valuation level after enduring a prolonged bear market.

With the continuous development of ZK technology and increasing adoption in the application ecosystem, the market is beginning to recognize the potential of ZK Stack. The extensive adoption of ZK technology in Ethereum’s **Beam Chain** roadmap highlights its long-term relevance and ultimate importance. From a user experience perspective, ZK-based Layer 2 solutions offer superior withdrawal experiences compared to Optimism Rollups. If the narrative holds, ZK ecosystems could deliver significant alpha in this bull market by challenging OP-based ecosystems.

Currently, in Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem, I believe there are four major sectors with “Stack” capabilities (referring to ecosystem-level software packages that other chain developers can extend and utilize) as well as several mid-sized projects. These four major L2 stacks are:

**Comparison of the Four Leading L2 Stacks**

https://preview.redd.it/9g2dkgwhqt4e1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c556c91a7e4d79c701e48544de5b69ceb7f4ce

**Among These Stacks, zkSync Elastic Stands Out as the Most Promising**

• **TVL Leader with the Lowest Valuation:**

zkSync Elastic currently ranks first in TVL within the ZK ecosystem but is valued relatively low compared to its peers.

• **Prudent Incentive Strategy:**

During the bear market, zkSync exhibited remarkable restraint, avoiding the common pitfall of wasting significant incentives at the wrong time. Currently, fueled by the momentum of the bull market, the community is voting on an incentive plan. If the proposal goes through successfully, zkSync’s performance during the bull market could be highly noteworthy.

Beyond zkSync Elastic, Puffer’s **UniFi-Based Rollup Stack** has left a strong impression on me. Drawing from a detailed Twitter thread by my friend AB, this project deserves a more systematic introduction. If executed well, it could emerge as one of the most undervalued gems in the market.

**Read more from AB’s Twitter thread:**

[AB’s Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/_FORAB/status/1854876348487287060)

In addition to zkSync, other ZK ecosystem projects worth keeping an eye on include **Starknet**, **Taiko**, and, of course, [DeGate](https://app.degate.com/?utm_source=fatbro_1_Reddit). 😊

**Tool Selection**

For grid trading strategies, transactions can be executed on the decentralized exchange [DeGate](https://app.degate.com/?utm_source=fatbro_1_Reddit):

[DeGate](https://app.degate.com/?utm_source=fatbro_1_Reddit) is an order book DEX based on zero-knowledge proofs, offering users a trading experience similar to centralized exchanges while maintaining self-custody. Its maker-free feature makes it particularly friendly for grid trading users.

Investing in cryptocurrencies has become a cornerstone of modern portfolios, offering high returns to those who choose wisely. As we enter 2024, the crypto market is brimming with opportunities. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a newcomer, selecting the right coins can make a huge difference in your financial journey. Here are the **best cryptocurrencies to consider in 2024**, including a standout recommendation: **$AVX**, currently in its pre-sale phase.

# 1. $AVX – The Game-Changer with 45x Potential

$AVX is one of the most exciting tokens in 2024, currently available in its **pre-sale phase**. This stage offers early investors the chance to secure the token at a discounted price before it hits major exchanges. Here's why $AVX is a must-watch:

* **High ROI Potential**: Industry analysts project **up to 45x returns** as the token gains traction.
* **Innovative Technology**: $AVX is built on a scalable and secure blockchain ecosystem tailored for real-world applications.
* **Strong Community**: The $AVX team has built a loyal and transparent community, ensuring trust and long-term sustainability.

With the ongoing pre-sale, now is the perfect time to invest in $AVX before it potentially skyrockets in value.

# 2. Bitcoin (BTC)

* **Why Invest**: Bitcoin remains the king of cryptocurrencies, a staple in any portfolio. With institutional interest growing and supply capped at 21 million, BTC is a reliable store of value.
* **Growth Potential**: Analysts expect a price surge as the next halving event approaches, making 2024 a bullish year for Bitcoin.

# 3. Ethereum (ETH)

* **Why Invest**: Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) remains unchallenged. The successful transition to Ethereum 2.0 enhances its scalability and energy efficiency.
* **Growth Potential**: As DeFi and NFTs expand, ETH’s utility and value are poised for significant growth.

# 4. Polygon (MATIC)

* **Why Invest**: Polygon enhances Ethereum's scalability, providing cheaper and faster transactions. It's widely adopted for dApps and gaming projects.

However, there seems to be a significant error in their listing.
The platform has mistakenly included ApeX, a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) that is explicitly forbidden (haram) under Islamic law. This oversight is particularly concerning as Bybit initially used the ApeX name and logo in their listing but on detail page bybit to refer to ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency associated with NFTs.
As user wont bother to read the detail pdf, 
this apparent blunder raises serious questions about the diligence and accuracy of Bybit's Shariah compliance efforts. It's crucial for platforms offering Islamic financial services to maintain the highest standards of accuracy and transparency to ensure that users can make informed decisions.

[Blockchain technology](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-is-a-blockchain-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners/) has redefined how we think about transactions, ownership, and trust. [Bitcoin](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-is-bitcoin-a-comprehensive-guide/) introduced the world to digital money, but it wasn’t long before Ethereum took that innovation to new heights by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the backbone of countless blockchain-based applications. Whether you’re new to crypto or looking to deepen your understanding, this comprehensive guide to Ethereum will break down everything you need to know about this revolutionary innovation.

# The Basics of Ethereum

# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily designed as a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain with broader applications.

Launched in 2015 by a group of developers led by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/categories/general.html), Ethereum’s primary objective was to go beyond simple digital payments. By introducing a platform that enables complex applications, Ethereum paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other innovations in the blockchain space.

# Who Created Ethereum?

https://preview.redd.it/eyhsvinuo03e1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6355f150b898031d8f52ac0873fdc1d1fb1818

Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and crypto enthusiast who was actively involved in the Bitcoin community. Vitalik’s vision for a more flexible and programmable blockchain led to the conceptualization of Ethereum. He collaborated with several other co-founders, including Gavin Wood, who created Ethereum’s programming language Solidity, and Joseph Lubin, who later founded ConsenSys, a major Ethereum development firm.

The Ethereum whitepaper, published by Buterin in 2013, outlined the concept of a blockchain capable of running decentralized applications and executing smart contracts. After a successful crowdsale in 2014, Ethereum officially launched on July 30, 2015.

# The Difference Between Ethereum and Bitcoin

# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Purpose

Bitcoin and Ethereum often get compared due to their market positions, but they serve distinct purposes. Bitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value—often referred to as “digital gold.” Its main objective is to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, focusing on security and immutability.

On the other hand, Ethereum was designed to be a world computer. It provides a decentralized platform for running code and applications, allowing developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services to digital art marketplaces.

# Technological Differences

The key technological difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their scripting abilities. Bitcoin’s scripting language is deliberately limited, focusing on maintaining a secure and immutable record of transactions. Ethereum, however, uses a Turing-complete language that enables developers to create complex smart contracts capable of automating tasks and managing assets programmatically.

# Market Position and Utility

Bitcoin’s utility lies in its role as a digital currency and store of value. It’s widely accepted and held by individuals, institutions, and governments. Ethereum, on the other hand, functions as a platform for the entire decentralized ecosystem, hosting applications that range from DeFi protocols to NFTs. While Bitcoin’s value is tied to its role in financial transactions and as a hedge against inflation, Ethereum’s value is linked to the utility of its blockchain and the applications running on it.

# How Does Ethereum Work?

# The Ethereum Blockchain

The Ethereum blockchain functions as a global, decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and running decentralized applications (DApps). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum operates on a distributed ledger technology, where a network of nodes collectively maintains and validates a record of all transactions. However, Ethereum’s blockchain goes beyond simple peer-to-peer currency transfers, introducing a programmable layer that allows for a wide range of applications to be built on top of it.

At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized network that follows the same basic principles as Bitcoin, ensuring that no central authority controls the data or network operations. Each node stores a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain, which contains all historical transaction data and smart contracts. When a transaction or smart contract is executed, nodes work together to validate the transaction and reach a consensus on its state, updating the blockchain accordingly.

Ethereum’s block time, the period it takes to create a new block, is typically around 12 to 15 seconds, compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. This faster block creation rate allows Ethereum to process more transactions per second, although it still faces limitations regarding scalability, which are being addressed with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and Layer 2 solutions.

# Smart Contracts Explained

https://preview.redd.it/wegemctwo03e1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a7e776cdccd7d9790e51393e5b3d83008b84a8

One of Ethereum’s most revolutionary features is its support for smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing code that enforces an agreement or set of rules without needing intermediaries. These contracts are written in Solidity, Ethereum’s native programming language, which is Turing-complete, meaning it can perform a wide variety of computations.

Smart contracts are stored on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent. Once deployed, they automatically execute the conditions written in their code. For instance, a simple smart contract could facilitate an escrow service, where funds are automatically released to a seller once the buyer confirms receipt of goods. The potential applications are nearly limitless, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies to complex supply chain tracking systems.

The execution of smart contracts is validated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which runs the code on every node in the network. This ensures that smart contracts produce the same result regardless of which node executes them, establishing a universal standard for DApps.

# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the heart of the Ethereum network. It acts as a runtime environment for executing smart contracts and deploying decentralized applications. The EVM is Turing-complete, which means it can handle complex instructions and perform nearly any computation that a traditional computer can execute.

What makes the EVM particularly significant is its universality. Developers can write smart contracts and DApps in various programming languages, including Solidity, Vyper, and others, and the EVM will execute them consistently across all Ethereum nodes. This consistent execution is crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.

The EVM also plays a key role in calculating gas fees, as it determines the computational resources needed to execute transactions and smart contracts. This standardization of execution and fees enables developers to create diverse applications on a secure and scalable platform.

# Gas and Fees

Every transaction or smart contract executed on Ethereum requires computational power, which is quantified in units of gas. Gas is the fuel that drives the Ethereum network, enabling it to execute transactions and run DApps. When a user initiates a transaction or deploys a smart contract, they must pay a gas fee in Ether (ETH), which incentivizes miners or validators to include their transaction in a block.

The amount of gas required for a transaction depends on its complexity. Simple transactions, such as transferring Ether between wallets, require minimal gas. In contrast, more complex operations like executing a DeFi trade or deploying an NFT contract consume significantly more gas. Users can also set their gas prices, with higher gas prices offering faster transaction confirmations during periods of high network congestion.

Gas fees have been a significant challenge for Ethereum, especially during periods of high demand. When the network experiences congestion, gas prices can skyrocket, leading to prohibitively expensive transactions. To address these issues, Ethereum developers have introduced various scaling solutions and upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 technologies such as [arbitrum](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/arb/).

# Ether (ETH) as Ethereum’s Native Cryptocurrency

# What is Ether?

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as the lifeblood of the entire ecosystem. While many people think of Bitcoin when they hear the term “cryptocurrency,” Ether plays a fundamentally different role. It’s not just a digital currency, but the fuel that powers the execution of smart contracts and transactions within the Ethereum network.

Ether’s importance goes beyond its monetary value. It’s required to perform any action on the Ethereum blockchain, from deploying a new smart contract to sending a simple transaction. This makes Ether essential for all activities that occur on the Ethereum blockchain, earning it the title of “gas” within the network’s ecosystem.

**How Ether is Used?**

Ether has multiple use cases within the Ethereum network, and each of them contributes to the overall utility of the cryptocurrency:

* **Paying for Gas Fees**: Every interaction with the Ethereum blockchain requires computing resources, which are paid for in Ether. This includes deploying smart contracts, executing functions within a contract, transferring tokens, and more. The cost of these computational tasks is denominated in gas, which users pay for using Ether. The gas system helps prioritize and allocate resources within the Ethereum network, incentivizing miners to process transactions based on the amount of gas fees offered.

* **Staking**: With the transition to Ethereum 2.0, [ETH holders can stake their tokens](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-to-stake-ethereum-in-canada-a-comprehensive-guide-to-eth-staking-rewards/) to participate in the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. By staking Ether, users help secure the network and, in return, [earn staking rewards](https://www.netcoins.com/staking/). This passive income opportunity has encouraged many investors to lock up their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and further increasing demand.



* **Collateral and Lending**: In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ether is often used as collateral for loans and financial instruments. For instance, platforms like [MakerDAO](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/mkr/) allow users to lock up their ETH to mint [stablecoins](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-are-stablecoins/) like DAI. Additionally, lending protocols such as [Aave](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-aave-is-leading-the-way/) offer users the ability to earn interest on their ETH holdings.



* **Medium of Exchange and Digital Currency**: Beyond its role within the Ethereum ecosystem, Ether also functions as a digital currency. It’s used for payments and transactions between individuals and businesses, similar to Bitcoin. ETH’s liquidity and market capitalization have made it one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies across exchanges and payment platforms.

**Market Position of ETH**

Ether’s market position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, next to Bitcoin, is no accident. Its intrinsic utility, combined with Ethereum’s widespread adoption, has solidified ETH’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto economy. With the rise of DeFi, NFTs, and staking, demand for Ether continues to grow.

The broader crypto market often correlates with the performance of Ether, highlighting its influence. Investors view ETH as not only a store of value but also a means of gaining exposure to the booming Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, major financial institutions and corporations are beginning to recognize Ether’s potential, leading to increased institutional interest and investment.

**Ethereum 2.0 and the Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**

**The Move from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake**

Ethereum initially operated on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which required miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. While effective, PoW came with several downsides, including high energy consumption, scalability issues, and the centralization of mining power.

[The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.netcoins.com/ethereums-dencun-update-a-deeper-dive-into-decentralized-finance-and-ethereum-2-0/) marks a significant upgrade to the network’s consensus mechanism. Under PoS, validators replace miners, and instead of solving puzzles, they secure the network by staking their Ether. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the amount of ETH they have staked, making the process more energy-efficient and decentralized.

# Key Improvements in Ethereum 2.0

https://preview.redd.it/kaok8j22p03e1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=f48526e14102719264899e1af317656c13fbbe80

The move to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to bring a host of improvements to the network, addressing the limitations of the original Ethereum blockchain:

* **Energy Efficiency**: One of the most significant benefits of PoS is its drastically reduced energy consumption compared to PoW. PoW requires massive amounts of computational power, leading to high electricity usage and environmental concerns. By transitioning to PoS, Ethereum aims to become a more sustainable blockchain.

* **Scalability**: Ethereum 2.0 introduces sharding, a technique that splits the network into smaller chains called shards. Each shard can process transactions and smart contracts independently, increasing the overall throughput of the Ethereum blockchain. Sharding aims to allow Ethereum to handle thousands of transactions per second, alleviating congestion and reducing gas fees.

* **Security Enhancements**: PoS brings additional security benefits by increasing the cost of attacking the network. In PoS, validators must put their ETH at stake, and if they behave maliciously, they risk losing their staked funds. This economic incentive discourages malicious activity and enhances the overall security of the blockchain.

**The Roadmap and Challenges**

With the successful implementation of “The Merge” and the rollout of sharding, Combined with the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions like rollups, Ethereum’s scalability has significantly increased. Looking ahead, the next focus areas include refining stateless clients to lower hardware requirements for node operators and enhance decentralization. Additionally, the Ethereum community is exploring protocol-level upgrades to strengthen censorship resistance and improve network security. These advancements aim to solidify Ethereum’s infrastructure and expand its capacity to support even more decentralized applications and innovations.

https://preview.redd.it/sx58jeq3p03e1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=49790c274aa80a7a35512ec07d9fc631451645fa

Decentralized applications, or DApps, are applications that run on a blockchain network rather than a centralized server. They are built using smart contracts, which allow them to operate autonomously and securely without relying on a single point of control. This makes DApps resistant to censorship and tampering, as they are deployed on a decentralized network.

DApps can serve a wide range of purposes, from financial services and gaming to supply chain management and social media. They are typically open-source, meaning anyone can inspect their code and verify their functionality. This transparency fosters trust between developers and users, enhancing the integrity of the applications.

**Notable DApps on Ethereum**

Ethereum is home to some of the most successful and innovative DApps in the blockchain space. The platform’s flexibility and programmability have attracted developers to create a diverse array of decentralized applications:

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: DeFi protocols such as [Uniswap](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/uni/), [Aave](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/aave/), and [Curve DAO](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/crv/) have transformed the traditional financial landscape. These platforms enable users to trade, lend, borrow, and earn interest without intermediaries. Uniswap, for instance, is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets, while Aave and Compound offer lending and borrowing services with competitive interest rates.



* **NFT Marketplaces**: Ethereum’s support for NFTs has given rise to popular marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), where users can buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets. OpenSea has become the go-to platform for NFT enthusiasts, hosting a vast collection of digital art, collectibles, and virtual real estate.



* **Gaming and Virtual Worlds**: Ethereum has also made waves in the gaming industry with DApps like [Axie Infinity](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/axs/) and [Decentraland](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/mana/). Axie Infinity allows players to collect and breed digital creatures called Axies, which can be used in battles and sold as NFTs. Decentraland, on the other hand, offers a virtual reality world where users can buy land, create experiences, and monetize their creations using Ethereum’s blockchain.

**The Role of DeFi in Ethereum’s Rise**

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been one of the driving forces behind Ethereum’s growth. DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain technology that allows users to interact directly with protocols and smart contracts, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. The transparency and efficiency of DeFi have attracted billions of dollars in liquidity, with Ethereum serving as the primary platform for most DeFi applications.

The rise of DeFi has demonstrated the power of Ethereum’s programmable blockchain, showcasing its potential to disrupt traditional banking and financial services. DeFi protocols offer users a wide range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. These platforms provide individuals with greater control over their assets and enable them to earn passive income through interest and rewards.

# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Ethereum’s Role in the Digital Art Revolution

# What are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like ETH, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis because each token is unique. NFTs have gained popularity for their role in representing digital art, music, collectibles, and more.

# Why NFTs Flourished on Ethereum

Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard enabled the creation and exchange of NFTs, paving the way for a digital art revolution. The transparency, immutability, and decentralized nature of Ethereum make it the ideal platform for verifying ownership of digital assets.

# Examples of Popular NFTs and Collections

Popular NFT collections like [CryptoPunks](https://cryptopunks.app/), [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), and digital artists like Beeple have leveraged Ethereum’s blockchain to sell millions of dollars worth of art and collectibles. These NFTs have sparked discussions about digital ownership and the value of virtual assets.

# Ethereum’s Broader Impact and Future Vision

# Ethereum’s Role in Web3 and Decentralized Web

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, focusing on decentralization and user ownership. Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities have made it the backbone of Web3 applications, empowering users to take control of their digital lives.

# Ethereum’s Vision for a Decentralized Future

Ethereum aims to empower individuals and communities through decentralization. Vitalik Buterin’s vision extends beyond just creating a platform for digital assets. The broader vision for Ethereum involves building a decentralized internet that allows for transparent governance, community-owned assets, and trustless interactions. In a world where data privacy and censorship are growing concerns, Ethereum’s vision is to provide an alternative structure for organizing societies and economies.

The Ethereum ecosystem has fostered the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). These organizations are run entirely by code, with decision-making powered by token holders who vote on proposals. DAOs are redefining how organizations can operate without centralized leadership, bringing about a shift in governance that aligns with Ethereum’s goal of decentralization.

# The Ethereum Community and Open-Source Development

One of Ethereum’s greatest strengths is its community-driven approach. As an open-source platform, Ethereum thrives on collaboration and contributions from developers, enthusiasts, and stakeholders worldwide. Unlike traditional software companies, Ethereum’s core protocol is maintained and improved through a decentralized governance model, where key decisions are made transparently and with input from the community.

The Ethereum Foundation plays a pivotal role in fostering development and community initiatives. While the foundation provides financial support and guidance, the broader Ethereum community actively drives innovation through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), hackathons, and developer grants.



# Potential Challenges and Risks of Ethereum

# Scalability Issues and Layer 2 Solutions

https://preview.redd.it/r6vwtk26p03e1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=5161b470398be66f171790cc93542545eb89353b

As Ethereum’s popularity has grown, so too have the demands placed on its network. High gas fees and slow transaction speeds have become significant pain points, particularly during periods of high demand. Ethereum’s limited scalability has led to congestion and exorbitant transaction costs, impacting the user experience.

To address these challenges, developers have introduced Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as rollups and sidechains. Rollups, like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, bundle multiple transactions into a single batch, reducing the load on the main Ethereum chain. These solutions aim to increase transaction throughput while keeping costs low, ensuring that Ethereum remains competitive with other blockchain networks.

# Security and Regulatory Concerns

While Ethereum’s decentralized nature offers enhanced security and censorship resistance, it’s not immune to risks. Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to several high-profile hacks and exploits, raising concerns about the safety of funds locked in these contracts. Ethereum developers continually work to improve security through audits, bug bounties, and protocol upgrades.

Regulatory concerns also pose a challenge to Ethereum’s growth. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s flexibility and programmability make it particularly susceptible to scrutiny, as regulatory authorities debate the legality of decentralized finance, NFTs, and other applications.

# Competition from Other Blockchain Platforms

As Ethereum continues to evolve, it faces increasing competition from other blockchain platforms, such as [Solana](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/sol/) in particular. [Solana offers faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and unique features](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-is-solana-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners/), making them attractive alternatives for developers and users. However, Ethereum’s first-mover advantage, vast developer community, and established infrastructure make it a formidable competitor in the long run.

# Participating in Staking and Earning Rewards

With the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, staking has become a popular way for ETH holders to earn passive income while supporting the network. Here’s how you can get involved:

1. **Understand Staking Requirements**: To become a validator on Ethereum 2.0, you need to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. If you don’t have 32 ETH, you can still participate through staking pools, where multiple users combine their ETH to meet the requirement.
2. **Choose a Staking Method**: You have two primary options for staking—solo staking or using a staking pool. Solo staking requires running a validator node, which involves technical know-how and hardware setup. Alternatively, you can stake through a pool with exchanges like Netcoins, where the platform handles the technical aspects.
3. **Start Earning Rewards**: Once your ETH is staked, you’ll start [earning rewards](https://www.netcoins.com/staking/) based on the amount of ETH you’ve staked and the network’s overall staking rate. Staking rewards vary, but they can be a lucrative way to earn passive income while contributing to network security.

Diving into the Donut Pool: Week 26,ethtrader,1goqbrv,2024-11-11 06:44:42,11,0.86,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1goqbrv/diving_into_the_donut_pool_week_26/,DBRiMatt,Meta & Donut,"Here are two other sources I find helpful for those wanting to understand a bit more on how and why liquidity positions change.

**Current state of the pool & the last week of trading**

Total Value locked in [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com/) is $ 50.83k 

* **4.19201** ETH
* **7353630** DONUT
* Trading Volume in last 24 hours = **$** **338.39**
* Trading Volume in last 7 days = **$ 3.07k**
* In the last 7 days ETH is has moved **+29.9 %**
* In the last 7 days DONUT has moved **+34.2 %\***
* Last week 1 ETH = **578.3k DONUT**
* Today 1 ETH = **628.63k DONUT\***

\*The discrepancy between the DONUT/ETH ratio is due to the fact there have been some larger buys on Uniswap / Mainnet, while Arbitrum trades at a lower price. 

So, some users have continued to sell their recent distributions, but users who have bought, have done so on Mainnet.  
Currently the DONUT pool is only incentivised by DONUT; ARB and SUSHI emissions have expired.

* **4753.6** **DONUT** per day distributed amongst all in range positions.  


The good news with the change in market sentiment and prices is that SUSHI and ARB also benefit, so those who provided liquidity in recent months will see gained value - helping most positions remain slightly more profitable than the Impermanent Loss sustained.   


Let's see if \~630k DONUT-ETH is the bottom!

**Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol on Arbitrum: Simplifying Cross-Chain User Experience,BlockchainChat,1gogq0j,2024-11-10 20:35:25,6,0.88,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainChat/comments/1gogq0j/arcanas_chain_abstraction_protocol_on_arbitrum/,Marjrie,,"


In a major breakthrough for blockchain usability, Arcana has introduced its innovative Chain Abstraction Protocol on the Arbitrum network. This protocol addresses one of Web3’s biggest pain points: the complexity of managing multiple chains and native tokens. With Arcana’s Chain Abstraction, Arbitrum users now experience an unprecedented level of ease and flexibility in cross-chain interactions, paving the way for blockchain’s mass adoption. Here’s a deep dive into what makes this integration so impactful.

### 1. Unified Balances Across Chains

Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol tackles the problem of chain fragmentation, which has long been a challenge for crypto users. With this protocol, users can seamlessly interact with multiple blockchain networks while maintaining a unified balance across chains. No longer do users need to transfer funds manually between networks or hold native tokens just to pay for transactions. Instead, Arcana unifies the user’s balances, allowing instant spending across chains, with the protocol ensuring the correct funds are utilized from the right network.

This capability simplifies the entire user experience, allowing for smoother transactions that feel intuitive and familiar, even for users new to Web3.

### 2. Convenient Gas Fee Payments in USDC/USDT

A standout feature of Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol is the ability to pay gas fees in stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. Traditionally, users need to hold native tokens (e.g., ETH for Ethereum, ARB for Arbitrum) to cover gas fees. This requirement adds an extra layer of complexity, especially for new users who may not understand or even possess these native tokens.

With Arcana, users no longer need to worry about constantly acquiring and managing native tokens for gas. Instead, they can complete transactions using stablecoins, enhancing convenience and removing a key barrier to entry. This stablecoin-based approach to gas fees helps make the Web3 experience much closer to a traditional app experience, which is critical for bringing blockchain to mainstream audiences.

### 3. The Role of Solvers: Efficient Cross-Chain Fund Collection

Another layer of sophistication within Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol is its network of solvers. These solvers dynamically gather the necessary funds from the chains where a user has balances and transfer the required funds directly onto Arbitrum. This means users don’t need to worry about managing multiple wallet addresses or manually transferring funds across chains. The solver network handles these complexities behind the scenes, ensuring a seamless transaction experience.

By reducing the technical complexity associated with cross-chain interactions, Arcana’s Chain Abstraction brings Web3 transactions closer to a single-click experience, which is precisely what blockchain needs for broader adoption.

### 4. Empowering Developers with Arcana’s SDK

As part of this launch, Arcana is also releasing a dedicated SDK, which will enable Arbitrum developers to natively integrate Chain Abstraction within their own applications. This integration will allow developers to bring seamless cross-chain interactions, stablecoin-based gas fees, and unified balances directly into their dApps, delivering a superior user experience.

The availability of Arcana’s SDK empowers developers to build applications that are significantly more user-friendly, paving the way for new innovations in DeFi, NFTs, and beyond. By allowing developers to access Arcana’s cutting-edge protocol features, Arbitrum’s dApp ecosystem will likely see a surge in adoption and engagement.

### 5. The Path Forward: Simplifying Web3 for Mainstream Adoption

Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol represents a new approach to blockchain usability, addressing several of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream adoption. By simplifying gas payments, unifying balances across chains, and enabling smooth cross-chain transfers, Arcana is creating a pathway for users to engage with blockchain networks without needing extensive technical knowledge.

For the blockchain industry, this is a crucial evolution. Simplifying the experience and removing barriers to entry is what will ultimately drive more people to Web3 and DeFi applications. With Arcana leading the way, the future of blockchain looks increasingly accessible and scalable.

### Conclusion

The integration of Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol with Arbitrum is a monumental step forward for cross-chain technology and user experience in the blockchain space. By enabling users to interact seamlessly across chains, pay gas fees in stablecoins, and unify balances, Arcana is setting a new standard for simplicity and convenience in Web3.

As the Chain Abstraction Protocol rolls out and Arbitrum developers begin to integrate these tools, we’re likely to witness an acceleration in blockchain adoption as more users and developers experience the benefits of a simplified, cross-chain Web3 ecosystem. This protocol isn’t just about making blockchain easier; it’s about making it accessible to everyone. With Arcana’s Chain Abstraction on Arbitrum, the journey to mass adoption feels closer than ever."

"Bug in MM 12.6.0 preventing to send tokens on Arbitrum One and Optimism network (Insufficient funds for gas)
",Metamask,1gm3bjs,2024-11-07 17:39:48,1,0.67,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/1gm3bjs/bug_in_mm_1260_preventing_to_send_tokens_on/,loupiote2,,"There is a bug in MM 12.6.0 that prevents sending certain tokens on the Arbitrum One and Optimism chain, even though there are more than enough ETH funds (on the account on the network being used, Arb or Op) to pay the fees.

For example, if I have 1 ETH and 100 USDC, both on the same Arbitrum account, I am unable to send the USDC.

There is a red error message under the USDC amount box in the sending dialog that says ""Balance:100. Insufficient funds for gas"". Since gas fees on Arbitrum One is paid in ETH and there is enough ETH on the Arbitrum One account, this message makes no sense. And it makes it impossible to send the USDC with MM (I found no way to sign the Tx, it always gives me an error). Note that sending ETH on Arbitrum One is possible with MM, but not sending any other token on the Arbitrum One account, even if you have the ETH on the Arb account to pay the gas.

A similar bug exists on Optimism.

Also note that Rabby does not have those issues and can send the tokens, so it is clearly a bug in MM, and not anything to do with the account balances.

Tested with MM 12.6.0 (latest version), on Chrome 130.0.6723.117 (latest), on an up to date Windows 11 system. The accounts used are secured by a ledger, connected to MetaMask.

Can anyone confirm this bug?"

Unlocking DeFi Yield Opportunities,Crypto_General,1gko8cv,2024-11-05 21:33:56,22,0.97,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1gko8cv/unlocking_defi_yield_opportunities/,tsurutatdk,Pump It,"Alright, so I stumbled on Yelay recently, and this Yield Layer concept sounds like it might actually change the DeFi game a bit. Basically, Yelay’s trying to yield something businesses can plug into seamlessly—like, we’re talking rewards programs, gift cards, loyalty points, etc., but powered by DeFi yields. No need for them to build their own yield infrastructure; they just use Yelay, which handles optimizing returns across multiple DeFi platforms automatically.

And the Ylay token seems to be more than just another utility token. Looks like it could give holders some serious perks within their ecosystem (better yield rates, early access features?). Also, the whole thing’s set up to work cross-chain, so we’re not locked into one network here, which is a huge plus IMO.

Not financial advice, but I think there’s potential here—especially for anyone bullish on DeFi becoming more mainstream. Feels like YLAY might be worth keeping an eye on if they can deliver on these promises.

Anyway, I look forward to seeing more chains so users have more options aside from Arbitrum and Ethereum for DeFi activities. Plus, I'm not sleeping on other coins either. Besides YLAY tokens, I'm also holding major coins like SUI, ETH, ARB, VET, and RNDR, among others.

Which one are you keeping an eye on: DeFi projects or other coins in different narratives?"
