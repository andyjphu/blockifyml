My youngest (4) behaves much worse at school than he does at home. What to do?,breakingmom,1i7qgrt,2025-01-22 19:20:35,6,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1i7qgrt/my_youngest_4_behaves_much_worse_at_school_than/,IWillBaconSlapYou,advice/question 🎱,"My oldest (F, 8) has always been a big old goodie two shoes and a bit of a perfectionist, so she would probably rather die than get in trouble at school. My middle (F, 5) is ultra social and a mega optimist, so school, like everything else, is something she's super down with. Lives to please her teacher. 

 Now my youngest, M, 4... For his first three years, he was a cozy, introverted indoors-boy who was chiller than both of his sisters. Then, over last summer, he came out of his shell in good ways and bad. Suddenly he loves the outdoors, wants to get involved in athletic games, and makes friends. Great! He also started non-consensually roughhousing and making his sisters cry. I forged a whole disciplinary structure that worked wonders. Putting his toys in time out when he refuses to negotiate (works way better than putting him in time out), small prizes at the end of the day for good behavior, practice doing healthy conflict resolution, finding appropriate alternatives for destructive energy, boatloads of positive reinforcement...

 So anyway, he pulled it together pretty fast at home. He never, EVER pushes, hits or kicks anyone in the house. He uses his words to ask for what he wants, and accepts redirection. He's generally in a happy mood. 

 But at school!!! Every day it seems, I'm hearing from his teacher that he pushed a kid, knocked over chairs, threw sand in the sandbox, you name it. He's always laughing when he does it, so I don't think it's a tantrum thing. I just don't know what to do when I've got Dr. Jekyll at home, and then he turns into Mr. Hyde at school 😳

 One thing I will say is the school district has rules upon rules upon rules for discipline, which is tough to work around... I told his teacher what works at home, and she said she'll implement as much of it as she can. Just seems like he gets away with stuff at school so he's pushing every boundary he can 🤦🏼‍♀️"
Sundog’s Grownup Enclosure Nearly Complete,Tegu,1i7kirx,2025-01-22 15:05:49,75,0.99,17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7kirx,fallowdeer,,"So, there’s a lot of sweat equity in this thing, constructed in our sunroom. I’ve been working on it for a couple of months. Had a real setback after filling the sandbox with substrate a month ago, only to have it infested with ants. Fire ants! After much angst—Finally got it all thrown out and started over with more sand/topsoil/peatmoss mix. Had the whole exterior of my house treated for ants. The rest of the floor, which is rubber matting,  is covered in Reptichip. I added a climbing rock, that he truly loves, some shelving and plants and a beanbag chair for us to share. We plan to cut a hole in the climbing rock, so he can go inside there and that will be his cool hide with sphagnum moss. There are two halogen heat lamps connected to smart plugs ( still need to figure those out)  for basking, and the floor in the room is heated to 80 degrees. I’m working with Arcadia to figure out the best UV lighting setup, so that is yet to be ordered. Also, I’m looking for a piece of slate for basking that, weeks ago,  I put “somewhere where I’d remember it”. Haha. I think, within a week, I should be able to move Sundog in for a trial run. I’ve been feeding him in there daily, so he knows the space but will be surprised this afternoon to see the new substrate. I also have a chicken coop heater that is safe to touch, that I can add, once I start seeing what is needed, temperature-wise. The room has a mini split and stays a constant 70 degrees day and night, but heats up quickly on sunny days, so I’ll need to regulate that. There are four pics included here. What have I forgotten, tegu friends?"
[Patchnotes] Leveling Rework + BIG Balance (22/01/25),supervive,1i7ey1j,2025-01-22 11:22:17,162,0.98,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/supervive/comments/1i7ey1j/patchnotes_leveling_rework_big_balance_220125/,gamle_korp,,"Find them here : [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1283700/view/587257078675931250](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1283700/view/587257078675931250)





*No more per-day level cap, new ability upgrades, lots of balance changes, and more!*

# Opening Context

Welcome to the second patch of Season Zero, Arc One, Beebo’s… etc, etc. As with every patch, we’re trying to synthesize all of your feedback into a set of big, experimental changes to improve the game, which we’ll then learn from and continue iterating on in future patches.  
  
Something to note: making large, systemic changes ends up having cascading effects on other areas of the game (and bugs… so many bugs), of which we sometimes miss. So if you find strange interactions coming from these big changes, please let us know on our Steam forums, Discord, or our social channels.  
  
Finally: a request we’ve heard from many of you is to get a sort of “state of the game” fireside chat to hear about where SUPERVIVE is heading in the long-term. Heard! We’re thinking about this internally as well, but would like to request a little time as we cook, iterate, and learn for the future. Maybe give us a month or so.  
  


# Battlepass EXP requirement reduction

>Since this is our first battlepass, we’ve been watching progression/completion rates and are feeling like we tuned this thing too aggressively, so we’re reducing the required EXP to complete the pass by roughly \~50%. We think the average player who plays an average amount of games should be able to reasonably finish the pass.  
  
Simultaneously, we’ve been mapping out our patch cadence and realized we miscalibrated when the battlepass-ending patch would land - so we need to bring it in a week. All up, this is still a significant ‘buff’ (ie. easier to complete the battlepass) but we’re being transparent that it’s also coming with one less week.



* Overall, it should take less than half the time to complete the Season Zero, Arc 1 battlepass than before 
* You will need to login and play a game for your battlepass progress to adjust to this patch 
* If you play around 50 hours total and complete most weekly and daily missions, you should be able to finish the battlepass 
* The battlepass end date has been updated to end on April 9th >>> April 2nd



# Leveling Rework

>In an effort to remove some of our more 'rules-y' systems and establish clearer paths to victory, we're testing removing the per-day level cap, increasing the maximum level for all hunters, and increasing equipment upgrade power. What we're hoping to see is that teams have more understandable paths to building a lead (when in doubt: farm for levels and upgrades) and others can better understand how they're behind.



* You will no longer be level-capped depending on the day - instead, monsters will always give EXP, with higher-level monsters giving a lot more 
* Maximum level has been increased from 9 >>> 15 
* **All abilities can now be leveled up to 3 >>> 4, with the special bonus unlocking at 4** 
* You now gain +10 ability power per level, with base ability power being reduced 
* Base equipment ability power/health has been reduced to 66% of previous values, while upgrades have been increased to 200% of previous values



# PVP EXP

>A TL;DR here is: you will now be immediately rewarded for sniping knocks on higher-level teams, which should make comebacks far more immediate (previously you had to stomp the knocked wisp for the EXP, which made it very hard to even take an advantage on a higher level team). Additionally, farming/picking on lower-level teams won’t slam you into a massive lobby advantage because they’ll give less EXP overall.



* A knock is defined as: when you take someone’s health down to 0 and put them into a wisp state. A death or kill is when that player goes into a deathbox state. 
* EXP is now granted at the KNOCK state, rather than the KILL state 
* There are new PVP EXP calculations where knocking targets above your level gives a lot of EXP, scaling down to very little EXP for knocking targets below your level (so try to pick that juicy high-level target for a comeback) 
* Repeated knocks on the same victim diminish by 50% each time (no blood bags pls)



# Minions/PvE

>With a higher weight being placed on PvE farming, we’re making these guys a little easier to farm and solo.

**Base Stats and Rewards**  


* Minions now spawn between level 6-15, rewards/level adjusted appropriately 
* Minion backstab gone, except for Magma Brutes and Sand Brutes 
* Minions now give 75% of the gold they used to give to account for more overall gold in the game due to more PvE farming

**Counter damage and vulnerable state**  


* Counter damage means the damage the monster takes when you counter them (that is, using a boop/displacement/crowd control effect on a monster when it’s winding up with that blue circle under it). Vulnerable state is when the monster takes 2X bonus damage for a period of time after being countered. If you didn’t know about these things, then your PvEing is about to get a lot faster! 
* Vulnerable state duration increased from 3.5 >>> 5 seconds 
* Squad leader counter damage up from 40% >>> 60% total health 
* Corrupted Guardian (biome leaders that spawn after clearing all monsters in the area) counter damage up from 5% >> 30% total health 
* Abyssal Hatchlings up from 5% >> 30% total health 
* Meteor Beast counter damage is 5% (unchanged) total health 
* Final Abyssal counter damage up from 5% >>> 10% total health



# EXP Meteor Soul

* Level 14 & 15 now grant an ability point so you can take all your abilities to level 4 
* If you acquire the EXP Meteor Soul at level 14, you'll instantly get 1 ability point 
* If you acquire the EXP Meteor Soul at level 15, you'll instantly get 2 abilities points



# Arena

* Players begin at Level 15, with 1 ability point to spend on a Level 4 ability 
* Will match Arena behavior with the old levels



# Day/Night 1 Revival Rules

>We’re trying to reduce the endless lemming-zerg that happens on day 1 (especially at high level play). This should at least make things more manageable if a team is trying to slam bodies into an objective. In the next patch we’ll also offer the ability to turn off this rule in custom games.



* Timer is now based on how many times your TEAM has used a respawn (25 > 30 > 35 > 40 > 45 > 50 seconds) 
* Previously it was the same sequence, but it would only increase when you INDIVIDUALLY respawned



# Hunters

# New Level 3 4 Ability Upgrades

>An often-heard request is for more playstyle-changing (or evolving) ability upgrades. We’ll document the details of the upgrade under each Hunter’s section, but just noting so you don’t miss it.



* Celeste, Elluna, and Void have new level 4 ability upgrades



# Beebo

>Everyone’s still figuring this guy out, so we don’t want to over-buff for lack of familiarity.

**Base Stats**  


* Toughness increased from 3 >>> 3.5 
* Base health increased by 50

**Beeb-omb (Q)**  


* Increased damage at all levels by 10%

**Zeep Zeep (RMB)**  


* Fire Zeep’s damage-over-time now deals lethal damage 
* Bugfix: Spell is no longer cast when leveled up

**Tonk Tonk (R)**  


* Bugfix: Kart is no longer instantly destroyed when spell is cast near terrain 
* Bugfix: General Kart behavior should be a (somewhat) smoother ride



# Brall

>We want Brall to feel like an exciting, skill-expressive Hunter. These changes are targeted towards shifting away from LMBrall and reducing his oppressive mobility.  
  
Historically, some of the worst feelings playing against Brall have come from him being able to repeatedly get value out of LMB without a whole lot of intentionality (SWOSH SWOSH SWOSH SWOSH). With this set of changes, we’re looking to introduce more mechanical skill-expression in both the “playing-as” and “playing-against” cases. Bralls will have to aim and track their targets better, whereas opponents will have more opportunity to use their movement options to dodge and weave.

**Caldera, Molten Greatsword (LMB) / Blazing Spirit (Passive)**  


* Overall hitbox width reduced by 20% 
* Sweet spot damage now applies to the entire edge of the hitbox >>> applies at the central tip of the hitbox 
* Bonus damage from 3rd/4th consecutive LMBs removed. Previously, LMB was giving bonus damage on every swing after the 2nd. 
* Empowered attack speed +100% >>> 0%

**Volcanic Rebuke (R)**  


* No longer resets on Wisp execution

**Flame Step (Shift)**  


* Flame Step no longer refunds all current charges when one charge comes off cooldown 
   * New Cooldown per charge: 10/6/6/6 seconds



# Celeste

>These changes are intended to sharpen Celeste’s role as a space controller on top of giving her more sandbox tools where she can really affect the shape of the battlefield. For the Celeste mains out there that specifically like to duel, these RMB changes are intended to provide more mechanical interest and options.

**Frozen Barricade (Q)**  


* Celeste can reactivate Frozen Barricade to freeze it in place  
   * Lasts for 6s when stopped
* \+500 wall health at all levels 
* Cast time decreased by 0.25 seconds

**Cryo Spear (RMB)**  


* Now does between 30% - 150% damage based on distance traveled 
* Now slows between to 40% - 10% based on how close the target is\]

**Skate (Shift)**  


* LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: Now creates ice islands underneath Celeste when she dashes over abyss 
   * Repeatedly doing this over the abyss will reduce the lifetime of the ice islands 
   * This resets if Celeste hasn’t dashed over the abyss for at least 20 seconds



# Elluna

>With the earlier changes we made to Wisp burnout time, we wanted to give Elluna more options around her unique strength of picking up allies. We also remember there have been previous versions where Elluna had too much power in this respect. This is an attempt to give some of that back while still introducing meaningful windows for responses and counterplay. And for all the Brawllunas out there, check that level 4 upgrade on Righteous Root.

**Moonlight’s Blessing (Q)**  


* Heal is 500% effective on Wisps 
   * Depending on Moonlight Blessing’s ability level and your build, this heal is powerful enough to temporarily negate enemy stomps

**Blessed Dash (Air Dash)**  


* \[NEW\] LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: Upon picking up an ally Wisp, if your cooldown is above 2 seconds, then set the cooldown to 2 seconds

**Righteous Root (RMB)**  


* \[NEW\] LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: Detonation radius increased by +100%



# Felix

>Everyone’s favorite stat-check benefits from the leveling rework more than others - especially when it comes to gaining bonus max HP (something he loves for his shield scaling). We’re preemptively adjusting.



* Toughness reduced from 4.5 >>> 4



# Hudson

>After the great de-Hudsoning of last year, we’ve been slowly shifting power to areas where we think he should be strong - specifically when he’s set up and hunkered down (does anyone use that term anymore?).

**Minigun (LMB) + Spin Barrels (RMB)**  


* TL;DR - We’ve swapped the ranges on base LMB and empowered LMB + RMB 
* Base attack range (LMB) has been reduced from 1300 >>> 1150 range 
* Empowered attack range (LMB + RMB) has been increased from 1150 >>> 1300 range



# Jin

>It’s worth calling out this mobility nerf is on top of the hotfix nerf we shipped last week where we removed his Q animation cancelling.

**Ash’Gara Warblade (LMB)**  


* Nerfed the dash impulse on the charge by 10% - 40% based on timing 
* Reduced damage by 5%



# Void

>These changes are intended to give Void more options in skirmishes. For Voids that like to duke it out or find themselves pushed by other hunters, the Void Snap changes are intended to give you more maneuverability to either disengage or follow-up. For the more utility-oriented Void players, we thought that sharpening the defensive output from this ability upgrade would help you find more reliable value.

**Void Snap (RMB)**  


* Void is slowed for 25% less when casting Void Snap 
* \[NEW\] LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: On cast, Void gains +50 Movement Speed for 2 seconds. On impact, Void gains another +100 Movement speed for 2 seconds

**Swap (Shift)**  


* \[NEW\] LEVEL 4 UPGRADE: Void and his allies gain a 300HP shield whenever they enter the outgoing teleport zone. This applies to Wisps.



# Zeph

>We think bunnyhopping (that is: using well-timed jumps to preserve forward momentum) on Zeph is cool and it’s a mechanic we want to keep. At the same time, being able to do so continuously without consequence has proven to be too much power (note: we’re aware other Hunters can also bunnyhop but that change had complications, so if you know you know and we’ll nerf it next time). Admin, he’s doing it sideways! (if you understood this reference, congratulations you’re old as hell)



* Each subsequent hop after the first is 90% as effective as the last in preserving forward momentum 
* This ‘dampening’ resets after 6 seconds



# Combat

# Spell buffering changes

>Goal here is to better associate the output of a spell with the input. Currently, there are times where spells activate long enough after the button press such that it no longer feels a part of the action. This should also reduce the number of unintended spell casts.



* Ability buffering means: when you press a button and can’t fire an ability for some reason (eg. you’re crowd controlled, there’s an overriding input, etc), the game will ‘preserve’ that intent for a little bit and keep trying to fire the ability 
* Lowered the default buffer window from 0.3 >>> 0.2 seconds



# Mana

>We’re asking you to fight a lot these days, which is resulting in a lot of sad third/fourth/fifth-partying shenanigans. So we’re trying to even the playing field for the fight-winning teams.



* Your mana is refilled upon knocking an enemy Hunter



# Items

# Powers

**\[NEW\] Beebo’s Boombox**  


* Plays otherworldly music that makes everyone in its radius invulnerable

**\[NEW\] Thorn Shell**  


* Gain 10% damage reduction and 20% damage reflect for 2.5 seconds. Additionally, on activation gain an additional short burst (0.3s) of 75% damage reflect

**Avalanche and Mega Avalanche**  


* They’re back and should no longer hit targets a few screens away from their path (lol)

**Power Shuffler**  


* Now self-destructs when it upgrades a non-Exotic into an Exotic

**Abyss Specialist**  


>Tracking an internal cooldown of 30 seconds is tough - especially for something as critical as “will I have an extra dash over the abyss or not?” With this change, it’s much easier to track if you ‘can’ proc Abyss Specialist, while also clamping down on extreme abyss mobility. Very elegant.



* Now consumes 50% of your glider gas instead of using a 30 second internal cooldown (if you have no glider gas, it will not proc)

**Fate Rewinder**  


* Now only restores 50% of your previous HP, instead of all of it

**Replicator**  


* Cooldown increased from 90 seconds >>> 5 minutes

**Magnetic Vacuum**  


* Vacuum force on living players cut by 50%

**Little Helper**  


* Death Grenade drop rate has been reduced



* PREVIOUSLY:   
   * 14% Anywhere But Here 
   * 42% Death Circle Grenade 
   * 42% Ethereal Smoke
   * NOW: 
   * 14% Anywhere But Here 
   * 14% Death Circle Grenade 
   * 28% EMP Grenade 
   * 42% Ethereal Smoke
* Drop count is still 2 of the above items



# Consumables

**Gnarl Heart**  


>More farming, more gold, more Gnarl Hearts. While we always love a good Gnarl Heart into the “really silly endgame puzzle” play, we think it should be a hard-commit strategy to get the necessary gold.



* Increased price from 75,000 >>> 112,500 gold

**EMP Grenade**  


* Throw a ground-targeted grenade that shreds armor and slows in an area-of-effect 
* Deals 1 damage on explosion



# Armor

**Ascended Armor**  


* UI now shows Ascended progress towards next tier 
* More differentiated audio ceremony when upgrading to each tier

**Broken Armor**  


* Reverted to previous broken armor texture to differentiate more from Red Armor



# Global Shop

>The goal is to keep up with SUPERVIVE’s movement/combat pace and to make shopping a viable action more often.



* Drop duration lowered to 10 seconds at all times in the match (previously was 20 seconds in the early/midgame and 10 seconds at endgame). 
* Power prices in Global Shop increased to 2,500/5,000/10,000/20,000 for Tier 1/2/3/Exotics 
* Soulbound scroll price increased from 2,000 >>> 5,000 gold



# Map

# Academy

>A nerf to all you yimyams who were looting the academy, reading all the books, and then teleporting out.



* Academy Anomaly 
   * The Anomaly will now be OFF at game start 
   * The Anomaly will turn ON at the beginning of Day 2 
   * Quality-of-life change: New player tooltip added to the anomaly



# Wellspring

>Wellspring’s needed an update for a while. The area’s felt a little crowded with the different elements - vines, wind rings, abyss, geysers. The wind rings and the large amount of abyss also generally let you bypass needing to play around the geysers as the main traversal tool for the high ground surrounding it. We’re doubling down on this area’s namesake so this biome is giving its intended combat texture.



* Removed most Glide Rings from the biome 
* Added a larger geyser at the center of Wellspring 
* Reduce some of the abyss 
* Better pathing from Desert traveling north into Wellspring



# Team Communications

>SUPERVIVE is most fun when you work together. We’re exploring ways to make it easier to non-verbally coordinate with teammates.



# Ping Updates

>Two goals - one is to add more fidelity to non-verbal ping communication so that you can communicate intent easier, and the other is to update ping voiceover to better match player intention.



* You can now double-press the ping button to issue a red ""Enemy Here"" ping 
* ""Let's Go Here"" voiceover (VO) plays on default (ground) pings 
* ""I'm Going Here"" VO now plays when the ping wheel's green arrow is used (used to play “Let’s Go Here”)



# Contextual Ping Updates

* Ping your HP bar to print your current HP & Mana into the chat 
   * If your HP is below 50% your Hunter will also say ""I'm hurt!"" 
   * If your HP is above 50%, but your mana is below 33%, your Hunter will say ""I'm out of mana!""



* Ping your empty food to say ""I need food!"" 
* Ping Vaults to say ""Vault here!"" 
* Pinging Armor now correctly says ""Loot here!"" 
* Updated chat messages associated with various contextual pings to improve clarity



* Using ""Anywhere But Here"" scroll or Teleport Soul now plays ""I'm teleporting!"" VO (used to say “I’m recalling”)



* You can now emote while dead to communicate important messages such as “Airhorn” to your teammates 
* Emotes from dead Hunters have a radio effect on their audio to make clear that the person speaking is speaking from beyond their grave



# Emotes

>We’ve added VO to the Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down emotes (unlocked early in Hunter’s Journey) with the intention of making them more effective communication tools. Consider using these to inform allies that you agree… or disagree.



* Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down emote VO  
   * “Thumbs Up” emote now plays “Roger That” VO 
   * “Thumbs Down” emote now plays “No thanks / Nope” VO
* Decreased the number of Emote audio instances that can play simultaneously



# Client

**Match History - Ally Record**  


* Match history now displays your allies names and provides a button to bring up their player context menu for invites and player reporting

**Hunter Mastery Mission - Felix (Burned Out)**  


* No longer tracks number of knocks caused by Level 2 Ignite 
* Instead, tracks number of times Level 2 Ignite is applied 
* Refreshes of the same application do not count 
* Thresholds are not changed in any way"

Elon Musk ’s Sonic Boom Salute: The Natural Reflex of a Billionaire Beast,Sarcgasm,1i6yt76,2025-01-21 20:06:16,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarcgasm/comments/1i6yt76/elon_musk_s_sonic_boom_salute_the_natural_reflex/,s4rcgasm,,"[Elon Musk’s hand shot forward—not a Nazi salute, of course not! No, it was a sonic boom aimed at our values.](https://i.redd.it/12e5e6y53gee1.gif)

Fuck Chaos Theory. This butterfly flapped its wings and caused a load of pointless discussion about whether or not we all saw what we know we fucking saw.

**Yesterday, amidst the grotesque theatre of Donald Trump’s Second Coming Inauguration, Elon Musk’s hand shot forward. Not a Nazi salute! Perish the thought, you paranoid plebs. No, this was something far more primal. A billionaire chest-beating ritual, a movement as natural as a lizard flicking its tongue or an incontinent orange octogenarian baby shitting into a nappy while people applaud it for writing its name indecipherably in a grand gesture as obscene as public onanism.**

Picture it: the Tesla titan, quivering with triumph, chest puffed out, eyes glazed in the manic glow of a man who thinks Mars is his side chick. Then the arm shoots out, flat-palmed, cutting through the air like Guile’s Sonic Boom from Street Fighter 2. BOOM! The gesture echoes through the void, a butterfly flaps its wings, and a hurricane spawns in Shenzhen. That’s Chaos Theory 101, mofos. Musk just handed physics its eviction notice.

Now I know what people are saying. Musk definitely DID NOT do a Nazi salute (wink wink) and he most certainly did not intend to send a secret (not so secret) message to his Nazi followers. Yeah, that is just fake news. The REAL story is this: Musk got excited, beat his chest and threw his hand out flat because that’s the NATURAL gesture that people give in those kinds of situations. Like when you’re thinking, you scratch your head. When you are hungry, you rub your stomach. And when you are fleecing the world, when you are riding mother earth and all her gullible yuppies around and around, then the Musk salute is as natural as reaching your finger into your nose to get rid of some dangling nose turds.

And the media? Oh, they were salivating. ""Was it deliberate? A signal to secret Nazi followers?"" screamed The Guardian. Let me tell you, folks, it wasn’t a dog whistle. It was a foghorn strapped to a space rocket, blaring, “I AM INEVITABLE,” while flamethrowers torched any semblance of doubt. Questioning IF it was a salute is as pointless as ducking behind a tin-can in the wake of a nuclear explosion. Your shadow will just be frozen in disbelief, as shit comes back to bite its own ass.

# The Apartheid Roots of Reflexes

Elon’s reflexes are honed by history, by the golden sands of Apartheid South Africa where little Elon learned two things—how to enjoy his sheltered life showered with opulent privilege, and how to exploit the life that he inherited without doing a day’s work for it himself. Dig deep into that emerald mine of lore, where his family fortune glistened with blood-stained dirt. A Nazi salute? Nah. This is muscle memory, folks, carved into the very sinews of a man who grew up in a system built on hierarchy and unflinching power.  
That hand shooting forward? It’s the same instinct that has him firing engineers on Twitter after lunch, launching Teslas into orbit because why the fuck not, and slapping his name on AI babies like he’s some kind of ordained technopriest of shitposts.

# Not His First Rodeo

Now, let’s ask: has he done this before? Erm… yes. Remember when Musk’s arm flailed uncontrollably at a Tesla Cybertruck unveiling, causing several Mars rovers to start fucking each other on the space live-feed? Or that time he gestured wildly during an AI conference and accidentally summoned the spirit of Ayn Rand? ChatGPT’s logo briefly changed into one of those stickers where the lady’s clothes melt off if you pour a hot beverage in it. Musk’s hand is a goddamn maverick, unbound by mortal will. If you told me it’s controlled by a neural link prototype gone rogue, I wouldn’t blink.

# Musk and the “Hurricane Effect”

But this isn’t just a gesture; it’s a phenomenon. A butterfly on steroids. Musk’s moves warp global markets. X stock plummets? A twitch. Bitcoin tanks? A wink. Trump's inauguration? The US dollar dives, the Yen strengthens, and his meme coin, $TRUMP, surges to an $11 billion market cap, only to tumble later, lol. Hurricanes form? That’s the Musk Salute in action, cutting through the world’s collective psyche like a Tesla autopilot ploughing through stop signs and mannequins/humans (what’s the fucking difference? Depends what colour the mannequin is I suppose)??!? Sorry my brain is imploding as I write this. Musk is just so clever, such a fucking GENIUS that I cannot wrap my tiny mortal brain around it. Maybe only Grok could explain this shit. But then again, seems unlikely. Usually when people do a Nazi salute, they get punched in the face shortly afterwards, or kill themselves in a bunker. Here’s hoping.

And yet, Musk dances away unscathed. Immune. Untouchable. Like a hologram or a virus that doesn’t need a host, just a microphone and a megaphone. He’s Schrödinger’s tech bro: both the villain and the visionary, the puppet master of a digital dystopia, flicking us off while pretending he’s the saviour.

# Conclusion: The Sonic Boom That Never Stops

So, next time Musk throws that hand out, don’t think “Nazi salute.” Think of it as an apex predator marking its territory. A natural reflex in the swirling vortex we call existence. The Musk Salute is no mere gesture. It’s the modern war cry of a man who sees the world as his sandbox, humanity as his beta test, and the universe as his PR stunt.

And as for that hurricane in China? It wasn’t chaos theory. It was marketing. Sorry if it took your face off though, eh?

>Elon Musk’s hand shot forward—not a Nazi salute, of course not! No, it was a sonic boom aimed directly at our most precious values.

I'm not an Nazi... I'm an ancient fucking roman duhfunn

What steam mop  & vacuum should I use?,smallbusiness,1i6rguq,2025-01-21 14:50:43,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1i6rguq/what_steam_mop_vacuum_should_i_use/,AbstractLogic,Question,"My brick and mortar store just opened and our peak season is cold & snowy months. Also, we are a kids play center with a a large indoor sandbox (40 tons aka 80,000 lbs of sand). The store is only 1800 SQFT so we thought we could get by with a normal map/bucket. 

First - Steam Mop: 

We had 100 customers the first two days open and our floors are getting absolutely demolished by calcium chloride (Ice Melt Salt) and boots. We find ourselves mopping the floors almost every hour of the day and to really get it all up we have to triple mop before we close.

  
Second - The Broom:

Our large indoor sandbox spills sand constantly and it's a major bummer. We have a shop vac that we use after hours but during open hours it's too bulky and loud to pull around and constantly vacuum sand. I was thinking of getting a Shark Stick vacuum that would be used during hours to quickly get spots of sand, but I would be interested in other types/brands of vacuums that are more efficient & cost efficient for sand.

Well thanks for reading my weird questions..."

we can minimize bias and the amount of misses that are common during card evaluations.
As always, it's our goal to review the statistics within the first week after the set’s release.

Wayfare is easy to pick up and relatively rules-light, a system you learn by playing. No previous knowledge of the system is required to join.

**Setting:** The once-proud city of Karzai, a beacon of faith and imperial grace, now lies shrouded in the shadow of the Sered conquerors. Two decades have passed since the brutal invasion, yet the city still bears the scars of war. Whispers of rebellion simmer beneath the surface, fuelled by a yearning for freedom and a growing distrust of the foreign occupiers. As the Lord-Regent's grip weakens, the stage is set for a desperate struggle for control.

You will mantle the roll of traders, mercenaries, or other waybound travellers, forced to navigate the shifting sands of political intrigue, brutal conflict, and ancient prophecies. Your actions will shape the destiny of Karzai, for better or worse.

**Tone:** The game will present an authentic depiction of a pre-modern world, including some more brutal aspects of it. Hence it will deal with violent themes including death, capital punishment, murder, and religious fundamentalism.

**Type:** Under a Conqueror’s Yoke is a narrative sandbox campaign, where events unfold dynamically, either with or without the players interference. The open nature of the campaign entails that the party may choose to go anywhere in and around the city, interact with any faction, and move the story in any way they desire.

**Notes:** This is a role-play heavy game with little combat compared to many other campaigns.

**Open slots:** 0/5

**Format:** Discord voice chat, Foundry VTT.

My Final 2024 Roundup of Games,patientgamers,1i3l218,2025-01-17 12:02:07,25,0.72,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1i3l218/my_final_2024_roundup_of_games/,MMAchineCode,Multi-Game Review,"Hello everyone,

I'm happy to submit my final overview of over 30 games that I finished in 2024. Just in time for the deadline too! Enjoy:

*Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands*, 6/10

*The Forgotten Sands* is my first PoP and it certainly makes a decent impression of its style of gameplay. Even though the story is more on the serious side, the game still entertains through its sense of adventure and spectacle, offering a swashbuckling experience that mixes in hacking-and-slashing, third-person platforming, and puzzle solving like *Indiana Jones*. The level design, however, is overly linear, and the camera is sometimes difficult to manage. The game’s dedicated arcade mode, meanwhile, shows how repetitive and dated the combat has become since 2011. That said, *The Forgotten Sands* is a brisk and compact, 8 hour adventure, and possibly the most underrated entry in one of Ubisoft’s most beloved and forgotten franchises.

*The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*, 7/10 - **9th Best of 2024**

*Oblivion* is a game that is absolutely engrossing in its first 30 hrs, but then begins to drag the longer it's played. Cyrodiil is a beautiful world to explore and to get lost in, the main story has plenty of spectacle and emotional heft to make for an epic adventure, and each of the factions and their available side quests offer fun and engaging distractions to lengthen your stay in Tamriel; but the game gets bogged down by various blemishes, including repetitive level designs, sluggish movement and combat, and the number of bugs available. Still, *Oblivion* is an absolute must-play for its high fantasy setting alone. What awaits for anyone who can power through its evident shortcomings is a video game gem from an innovative period of Western RPGs.

*Shadow of War: The Blade of Galadriel Expansion*, Unrated

Not much to say other than it is a short but satisfying epilogue to the main campaign. The new player character, Elatriel, has a new light ability that can stun and attack orcs in creative ways, as well as cool new gear for defeating the expansion’s new group of orc chieftains. An overall decent expansion with an engaging story that doesn’t feel short-changed. 

*Life is Strange*, 9/10 - **Best of 2024**

Aside from the game’s rewinding ability offering a unique approach to experiment with the choice-driven mechanics of an adventure game, the story of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price in this seminal classic is quite literally one of the most powerful video game stories I’ve ever played. Everything from the writing, setting, art direction, music, and performances made *Life Is Strange* an unforgettable narrative experience, that then made each moral choice feel all the more impactful because of an emotional attachment to the main characters and the journey to uncover the mystery and tragedy of Arcadia Bay. Regardless of how the game may be mocked for its young adult setting and dated slang, *Life Is Strange* is still home to a mature and emotionally rich story that is unafraid to make its players empathize and feel something. 

*Life is Strange: Before The Storm*, 8/10

A worthy followup to the first *Life is Strange*, this time exploring Chloe Price’s backstory and psychology in a prequel story. Much of what made *Life is Strange* a delight is carried over into this narrative prequel, but taking a much more direct approach to the anxieties and psychological complexities of its cast of characters. The absolute highlight is the friendship/romance of Chloe and Rachel Amber, presenting one of the more grounded relationships in gaming through its writing and character development. So while *Before The Storm* is an overall short experience, the story rarely skimps on its narrative beats while expanding the *Life Is Strange* canon.

*Life is Strange True Colors*, 8/10

A standalone follow-up to the previous *Life Is Strange* games, *True Colors* follows Alex Chen in the pastoral setting of a mountain town in Colorado. Like its predecessors, a mystery unfolds that requires the player character to use her supernatural powers to uncover the truth. For what it’s worth, *True Colors* is a lower-stakes story that highlights specific themes of family and emotional connection as a result of Alex’s time in foster care and her supernatural ability to read and even manipulate emotions. *True Colors* is a worthy addition to the *Life Is Strange* canon, bolstered by strong performances, equally strong writing, and a visually distinct setting. 

*Fallout 3*, 9/10 - **2nd Best of 2024**

Simply put, Bethesda’s first take on the Fallout IP was an extraordinary evolution for open-world RPGs. To effortlessly capture the post-apocalyptic Western is a testament to the game’s art direction, world design, music, and the quality of its side quests and writing. Bethesda arguably wrote their best and most engaging mainline story with this entry, with plenty of iconic characters and epic setpieces to complement its emotional core. Most extraordinary however is the game’s unparalleled sense of scope and exploration, where listening to Three-Dog’s radio while walking in any direction is bound to offer a new experience. *Fallout 3* is a benchmark for open-world games of the present, and a game that still excites and delights today because of its ambitions and creative risks.

*Little Nightmares*, 7/10 

As a *Limbo*\-style puzzle platformer, I had a lot of issues fully enjoying this game. Unlike its spiritual predecessors, the 3D space messes a lot with depth perception, making the platforming, movement, and jumping unreliable and especially frustrating. The game also seems to suffer from performance and input issues that make the game more frustrating than it deserves. That said, the worldbuilding, art style, puzzle design, and music certainly elevate *Little Nightmares* into an enjoyable and atmospheric horror platformer, even as it suffers from very overt flaws.

*Mirror’s Edge Catalyst*, 7/10 - **7th Best of 2024**

A worthy follow-up to the 2008 cult classic. Bringing over the original’s art direction, music, and immersive first-person perspective made exploring the City of Glass an atmospheric and enjoyable playground of parkouring and exploration. Storywise, the game is a let-down, even by *Mirror’s Edge* standards, with much of each mission feeling too much like fetch quests to be engaging and the side quests being unmemorable and grindy. Still, *Catalyst* breathes the same atmosphere and aesthetic that made its predecessor so iconic. 

*Little Nightmares II*, 8/10 - **6th Best of 2024**

A bonafide sequel that improves upon the foundation of its predecessor, both mechanically and thematically. Alot of the original’s depth perception issues are resolved or at least improved, while the game’s focus on the relation between Mono and Six gives the game an emotional drive that was missing from the last game. The environments are also more dynamic and visually interesting in comparison to the original, creating some stellar setpieces and spectacle that keep the adventure engrossing. Like *The Dark Knight* to *Batman Begins*, this is a sequel that builds upon everything *Little Nightmares* did well and further establishes the value of the franchise. 

*Star Wars: The Force Unleashed*, 5/10

Of the games I’ve played this year, *The Force Unleashed* feels the most like a game made for its time. Arriving after the polarizing Prequel trilogy, *Force Unleashed* would feel like a breath of fresh air, by playing as Darth Vader’s secret apprentice and offering a power fantasy with plenty of teenage edge. The story and gameplay are both serviceable even when they are overall shallow, but again, *The Force Unleashed* is a product of its time and representative of a paradigm shift for both the 7th generation of gaming and the Star Wars franchise by that point.  

*High On Life*, 6/10

Definitely the most \[adult swim\] of video games, which works in its favor and to its detriment. Within its absurdist non-sequiturs and obscure internet jokes, the game requires a level of patience and suspension of disbelief to get behind its often zany humor and ridiculous storyline. That said, *High On Life* is overall fun because of its Halo-like shooting and Metroidvania-level design, making for a fun if ultimately shallow adventure through outer space. It's definitely a game to be played because of its interesting premise, but it will be difficult to predict whether it’ll stand the test of time, especially given its creator’s controversies.

*Shadow Warrior 3*, 7/10 - **10th Best of 2024**

A pretty fun *Doom Eternal* clone that never lets up on the action. A good mix of interesting enemy types, fluid and fast-paced platforming, and a variety of weapons to shoot, slice, and smash the demons back to hell ensure *Shadow Warrior 3* rarely bores in its relatively short 8 hr playtime. The writing and overall story however is nothing to get excited about in *Shadow Warrior 3*’s action-packed campaign. 

*Amnesia: The Bunker*, 9/10 - **3rd Best of 2024**

What’s most impressive about *Amnesia: The Bunker* is its ability to maintain a stressful and unsettling atmosphere, almost in service of its Metroidvania design. Between the Beast constantly roaming behind the walls, the generator frequently running out of gas, and rats scurrying everywhere, *Amnesia* never lets up on its stress-inducing gameplay loop, which helps the game stand out as a truly horrifying and tense gaming experience. If you include the left-behind notes and photos, then *Amnesia*’s environmental storytelling is among the very best in the medium, lending a sense of tragedy and despair to the unrelenting horror. Definitely among the more haunting games I’ve ever played. 

*Scorn*, 5/10

A game that is equally extraordinary in one respect, and equally appalling in another, *Scorn* is probably the most polarizing game I’ve played this year. On one hand, the art direction, sound design, and overall atmosphere are second to none and definitely representative of the excitement surrounding *Scorn*’s cutting-edge vision. On the other hand, this game is a drag, if not unpleasant, to play: between its obtuse puzzles, clumsy first-person shooting, a surprisingly difficult boss fight, and sluggish exploration and mobility, *Scorn* feels underbaked from a fundamentally mechanical perspective. So much of this game is commendable and certainly deserving of praise, but there’s also so much that the game fumbles on a design and technical level. Finally, much of the game’s story, lore, and overall worldbuilding is very difficult to approach and interpret, given the game’s subject matter and gross imagery. 

*Venba*, 6/10

Like *Scorn*, *Venba* succeeds in one respect but otherwise fumbles in another. On the one hand, *Venba* tells a very personal and intimate story about family, Tamil culture, and belonging, heaving an emotional heft that resonates with the core experience of immigrant children and families. On the other hand, *Venba* isn’t the most engaging video game to play, given the hard linearity of its cooking mechanics and the overall short length. So while *Venba* is an emotionally powerful story inspired by a very personal part of the developer’s childhood, it never reaches its full potential as a video game.

*A Short Hike*, 6/10

Relaxing and laid-back to a fault, *A Short Hike* offers a quiet and deceptively simple if unspectacular open world. The game offers enough activities and adventure to incentivize exploration while never rushing the player to move along the story. Between volleyball, parkour, boat racing, fishing, and mountain climbing. *A Short Hike* is a relaxing adventure on an island full of activities, but it’s not one I’d return to after having finished all that I wanted. 

*Cocoon*, 10/10 - **5th Best of 2024**

This year’s only game to receive a perfect rating, game designer Jeppe Carlsen’s *Cocoon* is an utterly delightful mystery to unravel. Taking what Carlsen learned from his prior work on Playdead’s haunting *Limbo* and *Inside*, *Cocoon* is something of a stylistic departure, instead featuring a colorful and sublime alien world filled with puzzles ready to be discovered and solved. Every puzzle completed is another scratch to the itch at the back of the brain, as more parts of *Cocoon*’s expansive and mind-bending universe become more clear, challenging you to continue solving every puzzle until the universe comes to a satisfying halt. *Cocoon* is an absolute masterclass in game design and art direction, and a game that not only respects its spiritual predecessors, but even surpasses them as well.  

*Somerville*, 1/10

Another spiritual successor to Playdead’s catalogue, this time produced by former lead producer, Dino Patti, *Somerville* is a letdown both in design and scope. Whereas *Cocoon* dazzles with its puzzles and art design, *Somerville* attempts to succeed through its storytelling and exploration, but never reaches Playdead’s incredible heights. The game’s graphics look especially ugly, and the overall presentation fails to replicate the sublime minimalism and atmosphere that made Patti's work indie sensations. Movement is also sluggish and the alien enemy designs are very uninspired. Certainly a title that waddles in its predecessor’s footsteps instead of marching its own path forward. 

*Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name*, 5/10

The most recently released game to be featured, *Gaiden* is something of a mixed bag. While the choice to follow a smaller and more compact story in the LAD universe is a welcome change of pace from the series’ otherwise bloated and monstrous scale, *Gaiden*’s other decision to follow the events preceding *Yakuza:* *Like A Dragon*’s events through the eyes of series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu feels oddly hollow and insignificant. Not only was Kiryu’s story satisfyingly resolved by the end of *Yakuza 6*, but *Gaiden*’s retreading of prior plot threads without much creative risk makes the game feel like the most uninspired entry in the reputable Japanese franchise. *Gaiden* does at least dazzle with Kiryu’s new fighting styles, Agent and Yakuza, offering fun and dynamic ways to take down enemies, as well as a coliseum substory that offers enough challenge if also a bit of grinding. *The Man Who Erased His Name* is still a LAD game at its heart, but it unfortunately pales in comparison to its predecessors. 

*Fallout New Vegas*, 9/10

Building upon the blueprint of Fallout 3’s design, while adding deeper roleplaying mechanics, New Vegas not only feels bigger than its predecessor, but even plays better too. The Mojave Wasteland is endlessly explorable against the backdrop of an ongoing war that reaches its boiling point upon the player character’s arrival. Between choosing which factions to align with, deciding the fate of entire communities, and discovering your place in the Wasteland, New Vegas is an utterly engrossing story shaped by player choice, unique characterization, and a variety of questlines that offer among the highest replay value; not to mention the high quality of the DLCs as well.

*Rollerdrome*, 7/10

A game that emphasizes movement as much as its shooting, *Rollerdrome* is a highly original take on the skating genre and the third-person shooter. Each level offers its own set of challenges to overcome, while the combo meter and scoring incentives efficiency and adaptation. Meanwhile, intermissions between each level allow the player character to explore the dystopian world of *Rollerdrome*, through laid-out notes, emails, and newspaper clippings in a very environmental approach to worldbuilding. Difficult but exciting, *Rollerdrome* is an action game that rarely lets up on the adrenaline. 

*Spirit of The North*, 1/10

Overwhelmingly boring and uninteresting, the game’s ugly graphics, uninspired soundtrack, and tiresome movement cannot help to make this game feel anything but a chore to finish.  

*Little Nightmares: Secrets of The Maw Expansion*, Unrated

The expansion carries over a lot of the base game’s problems, including unresponsive input and troublesome depth perception. The three levels included in this expansion are also generally uninspired and even frustrating, including water sections in the first level, glitches in the second, and the enemy types and their hyper-aggression in the third. The overall storytelling is especially lacking with a really disappointing ending as well. An overall insignificant and shallow follow-up to the base game.   

*Far Cry 3*, 9/10 - **4th Best of 2024**

Like *Bioshock* and *Spec Ops: The Line* before it, this esteemed entry in the *Far Cry* series was meant for a gaming audience that had ‘grown old’. No longer focused on portraying the player character as either heroic or stoic, *Far Cry 3* uses its open-world sandbox as a medium to tell a dark and mature coming-of-age story, with the emotionally vulnerable Jason Brody at its center. Between themes of piracy, slavery, survival, and violence, Jason emerges as a complex and morally torn protagonist, who commits harm and murder to save his friends and family almost as much as he revels in the bloodshed and spectacle. Vaas meanwhile is an intimidating and iconic villain not only through his words and actions, but through his oppressing antagonism and foil to Jason’s insecurities. Between *Far Cry 3* offering a fun, chaotic open world and gameplay, it’s ultimately Ubisoft’s success at writing such a mature story with darkly relatable characters and themes that make the game unusually extraordinary within a crowded genre of shooters.

*Mass Effect*, 8/10 - **8th Best of 2024**

2024’s final game is the first entry to the epic *Mass Effect* trilogy. Given that this was Bioware’s first attempt at a third-person shooter, developed on the at-the-time novel Unreal Engine 3, it’s hardly flattering to say that *Mass Effect* has its rough edges. Shooting and combat aren’t as punchy or strategic as Gears of War, nor does mobility make exploration feel anything less than a drag. That said, *Mass Effect* is a showcase of Bioware’s best habits. Not only is the game a masterclass in roleplaying design, but the presentation, writing, storytelling, and voice-acting broaden *Mass Effect*’s horizons beyond simply another action-RPG, but a fully realized cinematic experience of epic proportions. M*ass Effect* is a phenomenal start to an exciting trilogy in outer space.

Impressions of games I replayed or did not finish:

1. *Ori and The Will of The Wisps* (Replay)
   1. Still not as exciting as I’ve been led to believe, even after exploring 100% of the map and attempting the game on hard mode. It’s a decent story, with even more decent exploration and a fun suite of powers and abilities to explore the many different settings spread out across its Metroidvania world, but I can’t help but feel the game’s overhyped.
2. *Dishonored: Definitive Edition* (Replay)
   1. The main story is not why you play *Dishonored*. You play *Dishonored* to approach each objective from whatever angle is most effective or best suits your playstyle. In that sense, *Dishonored* remains one of the greatest immersive sims ever, truly emphasizing the immersion of an industrial, Victorian setting hampered by backdoor politics, an oppressive plague, and supernatural black magic. 
3. *Atomic Heart* (DNF)
   1. What a messy kitchen sink of a game that cracks under its own ambitions. The platforming is frustrating, the puzzles can feel brain-dead, the open world is empty, and the first-person shooting is neither action-packed nor strategic. Not to mention the story and setting is of the generic, dystopian world that just so happens to give the player character blackouts as an artificial means to create mystery. A terrible letdown of a first-person shooter.
4. *South Park: The Stick of Truth* (Replay)
   1. Still quite literally the funniest *South Park* story to never air on TV. The writing and characters are still ever fun and irreverent, while the main story and side-quests are more exciting and adventurous than a *South Park* game had any right to be. The turn-based may be simple, but it offers enough variety and excitement to last for the game’s relatively short playtime.  
5. *South Park: The Fractured But Whole* (Replay)
   1. Alot more dragged out than I remember, but the grid-based combat is a smart shake-up to the previous game’s turn-based combat. The main story is certainly darker and more high-stakes than its predecessor, but the side content doesn’t feel nearly as original. Still, the game is fun and I had a decent time replaying it once again. 

Year-End Top 10\*:

1. *Life Is Strange*
2. *Fallout 3*
3. *Amnesia: The Bunker*
4. *Far Cry 3*
5. *Cocoon*
6. *Little Nightmares II*

**Genre:** Physics Simulation

**Estimated year of release:** Probably between 2010 and 2019

**Graphics/art style:** 2D tile-based pixel art

**Notable characters:** n/a

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** Sandbox powder simulation

**Other details:** This was a powder simulation game similar to projects such as ""Sand:box"" or ""The Powder Toy."" It was notable in my mind for, rather than having each simulated particle being rendered as a mono-colored pixel, instead represented every particle with an illustrated pixel art tile. Said tiles, I believe, would ""auto-tile"" to seamlessly connect with other substances of the same type.

I do not remember much about this game, but it seemed very mobile gamey, and I think there were in-app purchases to obtain more elements to use.

Sorry that I have so little information on this, probably not helped by the fact that it's a random obscure 2010s Play Store game. It's not too important; I just wanted to use it as research material for a game I am developing (And just to see it in action again because it looked cool in general). Figured I'd give it a shot!"

HD2 More Planet Types,Helldivers,1i01ozm,2025-01-12 19:40:33,467,0.98,56,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i01ozm,TheHeavyIzDead,DISCUSSION,"
Helldivers 2 has an already well versed selection of planets for us to choose from, however that doesn’t mean we can’t see more biomes introduced like the swamp. For that to happen I believe a biome needs to bring either a completely new aesthetic or new gameplay mechanic to the table. 

Examples: planet that has massive hurricanes that make strats super inaccurate during them, or a planet that glows green due to a bioluminescent crystal found everywhere.

Primal world - A land pocketed with magma and volcanoes, weather it’s the blazing hot gas gets or the bubbling firey pits of magma, primal worlds are dangerous at every step. Abundant in raw metals and industrial capabilities, many are drawn to its promise of risky riches but few ever see them come to fruition. The deadly atmosphere of the region would make for fun but difficult gameplay, and the terrain would likely be much more open than the swamp as an example. For storms the planet could have a thick haze of ash that settles over the land and could even require some form of filtration devices.

Boreal world - a halfway between tundra and temperate forest, the biting cold is offset by the lush and ancient pine forests covering its landscape. Rows of silent towering pines are only broken up by fields of wildflowers or expanses of open face rock. The occasional stream cutting its way through the previously thawing landscape. Maybe the world could snow itself overtime in the event of a storm coming in but I’d also love to see the biome more in a springtime/summer setting.

Ocean world - now as cool as water worlds are I don’t think it would make for thrilling gameplay in HD2. That being said having a set of maps placed on a chaotic archipelago would be really cool to see, hoping between the choke points connecting them while pushing your 12th beach that battle. Island would be a challenging landscape with a relaxing gorgeous aesthetic,rolling waves craving into slopes of sand. What better place to teamkill with some 380mm?

War worlds - landscapes already ravaged by the galactic scourge, cratered patches of battles past, expansive dilapidated trench networks built by solders long since dead and forgotten. A true glimpse into hell, these planets would be the perfect sandbox for a helldiver testing their worth. If one were to really dream I’d love to see a crashed super destroyer or spaceship of sorts, but that could also be something amazing for every planet type. I personally think a trench world is the type of planet lacking the most from this game currently. The special weather event could be a random wide spread heavy artillery shelling, calling back to the days of DSS lol

Mushroom world - think Minecraft mushroom island but instead of mooshroom cows there are the enemies super earth. Tower caps bigger than a card, huge forests and strange mycelium structured biomes, an extremely alien setting when compared to the majority of planets found in the galaxy.

Let me know what types of battlefields/biomes you’d want to see in game!"
The Forgotten Game,nosleep,1hzvguq,2025-01-12 15:02:11,14,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hzvguq/the_forgotten_game/,JonathanS223,,"I just need to type this out.

The playground was always old. When I was a kid, don’t think I ever saw it in its prime. I’m not even sure if it ever had one. The paint on the old metal equipment was chipped, flaking off in uneven strips that revealed the deep rust beneath. The swings creaked in protest with each sway, and the merry-go-round groaned like an old man trying to stand up, and the aluminum slide was always hot in the summer whether in the sun or not. Yet, as kids, we loved it. It was ours, tucked away at the edge of the woods where no adults ever came unless they were calling us home for dinner. It was the only place where we felt free from the pressures of school and our family life.

Even now, the image of that place sits vividly in my mind. I can see the twisted bars of the jungle gym, the crooked ladder leading up to the slide, and the sandbox that always had more weeds than sand. It didn’t matter. It never mattered. We made do, as kids do. We ruled that tiny corner of the world, oblivious to its decay, its unkempt edges. But there was something about that playground I can’t forget—a game we used to play, though none of us ever really understood it. It wasn’t like tag or hide-and-seek; it felt more... important, like there were rules we just knew, even if no one taught us. To this day, I only remember bits and pieces: a riddle we’d chant, strange steps we’d take, and the way we’d laugh—except, thinking back, it didn’t always sound like us. That laughter... it was off, like it came from somewhere else, sneaking into our game without permission. Only as an adult when I see children play, it feels like a tickle in the back of my mind.

My best friend Leah loved that game more than anyone. She was always the one who seemed to know the rules, even though she never told us how she learned them. She had this grin—a crooked, teasing thing that made you feel like you were part of a secret, even if you didn’t understand it. I’d watch her as she started the game, her voice clear and confident as she called out the rhyme. The words were strange, like a song you hum but don’t really know, yet when Leah said them, they felt like magic.

Leah and I had been together for as long as I could remember. She was the kind of person who made everything fun, who turned the simplest things into adventures. I’d follow her anywhere—through the woods, onto the creaky merry-go-round, or up the jagged jungle gym. I didn’t know why, but I always felt happiest when I was with her. Back then, I didn’t understand the fluttery feeling I’d get when she laughed or looked my way; I just knew I liked being near her. And it wasn’t just me, everyone adored Leah. She was bold in a way that made us believe we could be too, just by keeping up with her.

Until one day, she wasn’t there anymore.

It happened on the playground. I remember that much, but the rest feels like trying to hold water in my hands. One minute, Leah was there, leading the game like she always did. Her ponytail swung back and forth as she laughed, her voice ringing out like it could chase away the shadows under the trees. She was on the merry-go-round, spinning so fast we all screamed at her to slow down. And then... she was gone.

I don’t mean she ran off to hide or went home because her mom called her. She just wasn’t there anymore. One second she was laughing, and the next, the merry-go-round was empty, still spinning, creaking louder than ever. We froze, staring at it like maybe she was just hiding behind the bars or crouched down where we couldn’t see. But she wasn’t.

We called her name over and over, running all over the playground and even into the woods.

“Leah! Leah, come on! Stop messing around!” I had shouted so loud my throat burned. None of us wanted to say it, but it felt like the playground had taken her—like it had sucked her up and hidden her somewhere we couldn’t go.

None of it made sense. It didn’t feel real. I kept expecting her to jump out and yell, “Gotcha!” and the longer we stood there, staring at the merry-go-round, the more it felt like something horrible had happened. We didn’t understand it. How could we? We were just kids. All we knew was Leah was gone, and we couldn’t find her. The neighbor kids that were playing had took off to get their parents but I remember remaining. That meant I was the only one who heard the sound from deep within the woods. A strange groan like steel being bent or a musician dragging their bow across a cello’s lower strings. A harsh, groaning, sound.

I ran.

The police searched the woods for weeks, but they found nothing. Eventually, the town moved on, and so did I—at least, that’s what I told myself. The sound and my friend were always in the back of my mind.

I think about Leah more often than I care to admit. The way her laughter echoed through the trees, the flash of her sneakers as she climbed to the top of the jungle gym, the secretive glint in her eye when she spoke the words of that strange rhyme. She’s still there, somewhere, in the corners of my mind and the shadows of my memory. I can’t let go of the feeling that I failed her—that I let her slip through my fingers when I should have held on tighter.

Why am I telling you all this? Why am I writing my personal trauma on this website? I’m thirty-four now and I can’t stop thinking about it. Lately, it has become even harder to put at the back of my mind. It’s like a splinter, a sharp point that keeps poking no matter how much I try to ignore it. I tell myself that I’m letting work get to me or the stress of having to work two jobs just to make things work

It began to get worse a week ago when I had would the same reoccurring dream. I was back at the playground, standing on the cracked asphalt that had once been a basketball court. The air smelled of rust and damp earth, the kind of smell that clings to old metal and forgotten places. In the dream, I heard the familiar creak of the swings, the groan of the merry-go-round, and faint laughter—high-pitched, echoing as if it were coming from underwater. There was also that strange groan but much louder than I had ever heard it before. It made my chest tighten, that sound. It was too distorted to be comforting and too familiar to be ignored. I woke up drenched in sweat, the laughter still ringing in my ears like a taunt. Ever time I had that dream, it felt as if that sound was getting closer.

I tried to make the dreams stop. Doctor’s prescription, self medicated with weed, anything. Every night, I would wake up to that cursed place. Each time, the details became clearer, sharper, and closer. I started noticing things I hadn’t as a child: the splintered wood of the slide, the warped metal of the monkey bars, the symbols scratched into the peeling paint. They were crude and jagged, shapes that seemed to shift and twist the longer I stared at them, as though the dream itself didn’t want me to understand.

I know I was lying to myself. I think it was two days ago I woke up in a cold sweat realizing the truth. Something was calling me back. I had somehow failed her, and I needed to go back and see what I could do to make it right. To stop that groan from getting her.

It’s not just about the playground anymore. It’s about Leah. About what happened that day, about the pieces of myself I left behind with her. I didn’t know if I’d find answers, but I couldn’t keep pretending. I had to go back.

I told myself it was just a visit to family, an excuse to see familiar faces and reconnect. So, one Friday after work, I gave in. I packed a small bag—just enough to make it look like a regular trip—and got in my car. The drive felt like both a return and a journey into something unfamiliar. The landmarks—old gas stations, crooked signs, and faded shops—passed by like ghostly memories, stirring up feelings I’d buried for years. The town was the same, yet different, as though it had somehow changed without me realizing it.

By the time I arrived, the sun was dipping low, casting the town in soft gold and orange hues. The evening light made everything look still. I spent time with family, catching up on small talk and listening to stories that no longer felt as familiar as they should. But even as I sat there, I could feel the pull. I knew where my thoughts kept wandering, even if I didn’t speak it aloud. The playground wasn’t far, and I could almost feel its presence, waiting patiently for me to come back.

I sat across from my parents at the kitchen table, my fingers drumming nervously against the edge. The house smelled of garlic and rosemary, and the soft hum of my mom chopping vegetables filled the air. Dad was sitting at the window, sipping his iced tea, staring out into the yard. Everything about this moment should’ve felt comforting, like it always had when I was younger.

""Hey, uh, Mom, Dad,"" I began, my voice low and hesitant, ""Do you remember the old playground, the one by the woods?""

My mom paused mid-chop, glancing at Dad. ""Oh, sure,"" she said, smiling as she wiped her hands on a towel. ""That old place. You used to play there all the time with the other kids. What about it?""

I shifted in my seat, trying to figure out how to bring this up. The words felt awkward, like they didn’t quite belong in the air. ""I don’t know, I’ve just been thinking about it lately,"" I muttered, unable to keep the unease out of my voice.

Dad chuckled from the window, not looking at me. ""That place? Good grief, it was falling apart even when you were a kid. I remember when they took down the slide. It was so rusted, they thought someone might get hurt.""

""Yeah,"" I said, my eyes glued to my hands in my lap. ""But do you remember how the older kids used to tell stories about it? Weird stories?""

Mom raised an eyebrow, still focused on chopping. ""Stories? Well, there were always rumors, especially around Halloween. I think some kids thought it was haunted or something."" She shrugged, as if it were just another silly tale. ""We always told you to stay away from that place after dark.""

I couldn’t help myself. ""What kind of stories? I don’t remember any."" I pushed, my heart pounding in my chest, hoping they’d say something, anything that might make sense of the creeping dread that had settled over me.

Dad looked over at me with a smile, like he was about to tell me something funny. ""Oh, you know how kids are. Ghost stories. Some said the playground was built on cursed land, or that the swings would move on their own. The usual stuff. But honestly, I think it was just a way for the older kids to scare the younger ones so they could smoke and hook up.""

I wanted to argue, to tell them that it wasn’t just a silly story. But as I looked at them, I realized they had no idea. No idea at all. To them, it was all just an old memory, something harmless and forgotten. I was the only one who remembered—really remembered. Did they even remember Leah?

Dad chuckled and took another sip of tea. ""They used to say things like that about all sorts of places when we were kids. It’s just a way to make the place seem more exciting, more dangerous. It’s a playground, for crying out loud. There’s nothing to it.""

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""I guess you’re right.""

But even as they went back to talking about dinner, I could feel the weight of their words pressing on me. It was all so casual to them, like the playground was nothing more than a relic of childhood. As I sat there listening to them, the quiet seemed to press in even harder. I wanted to ask them more, to see if they knew anything else, but I couldn’t bring myself too. They didn’t understand. They hadn’t seen what I had seen. And for the first time in a long time, I wondered if they ever would.

After dinner, I told them I was going to drive around and check out the old places I used to hang out. They happily told me to have fun and suggested a few places like where the Blockbuster used to be or the skating rink. I had only one destination in mind.

The playground was still there, though it looked far worse than I remembered. The swings hung limply from rusted chains, their seats split and sagging. The merry-go-round had tilted to one side, its base half-buried in the ground like the earth had tried to reclaim it. The slide was nothing more than a skeletal frame now, its jagged edges jutting out like broken bones. The sandbox had been almost completely devoured by weeds, their spindly stalks reaching up past my knees. Even the jungle gym, once a centerpiece of our games, was nothing but a twisted ruin of metal.

The air was heavy, thick with a stillness that felt unnatural. It wasn’t just quiet—it was the kind of silence that pressed against your ears, making you hyper-aware of every tiny sound. My own footsteps on the cracked asphalt felt too loud, as if they were intruding on something sacred—or something forbidden. A shiver ran through me, sharp and cold, the kind that crawls down your spine when you know you shouldn’t be somewhere but can’t bring yourself to leave.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the remains of the place that had once been ours. The memories came rushing back—Leah’s laugh, the strange game we used to play, and the way the shadows always seemed to stretch a little too far here, even in the middle of the day. It all felt so wrong now, like the playground had been waiting for me to return. I clenched my fists, willing myself to move, to turn back toward the car and forget this place forever. But I couldn’t. Not yet.

Something was here. Something was waiting. And deep down, I knew I wouldn’t leave until I found it.

The wind kicked up, swirling leaves and dust around my feet as I stepped toward the swings, the last day I saw Leah playing through my mind. The cold wind gusted around me and the swings moved in a slow, rhythmic sway, creaking in protest as if they carried invisible riders. The sound grated on my nerves, each groan dragging me deeper into a memory I wished I could forget.

I hesitated before sitting down, the cold metal chains biting into my palms. As soon as I settled, a rush of déjà vu slammed into me, stealing my breath. I gripped the chains tighter, trying to steady myself, but it was no use. The sensation was overwhelming, like being caught in the pull of a tide, dragged into something far older than me. I *remembered* this: sitting here, the swings rocking gently, the faint sound of laughter—high-pitched, distorted, and wrong—floating on the breeze. It was laughter I didn’t want to hear again.

And then, I did.

“Ethan…”

The voices were faint at first, a lilting whisper that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. My name, spoken in those singsong tones, sent a chill down my spine. “Ethan…” The sound grew louder, closer, yet I saw nothing. The playground was empty, a ruin of rust and decay.

“Leah?” I said hoarsely, my voice sounding as if it had forgotten how to speak. There was no response. The moon had started to crest the trees and it’s silver glow illuminating the cursed place I sat. My eyes began to roam around, senses heightened as if I was getting ready to fight.

On the slide, where faded graffiti had once scrawled vulgarities and crude drawings, new symbols emerged. They weren’t painted—they *grew* from the metal itself, glowing faintly in the dimming light. Their jagged edges shifted as if alive, forming words that sent my stomach plummeting:

***To leave this place, you must win the game.***  
***But play it wrong, and here you’ll remain.***

The game.

The words blurred as I stared at them, pulsing in rhythm with the rapid thud of my heartbeat. And then, like a door cracking open, the memories came flooding back. The rules. The steps. The twisted ritual we had followed so blindly as children, not understanding its weight. It was as if my adult brain could comprehend what I could not as a child. This was no simple fun thing but something twisted and evil.

The game. How was the game played?

I could hear Leah’s voice clearly in my mind, her excitement practically bubbling over. ""Okay, Ethan, listen closely,"" she would say, always eager to begin. ""We have to say the words, or it doesn’t start. It’s the rules, and the rules are everything.""

I remembered how she’d lead us, the words spilling from her lips like a chant we were all supposed to know by heart. ""Round and round, we spin and fall, the shadows call, the game begins.""

The memory hit me like a wave, and suddenly, I was back there, standing before the merry-go-round. The once-vibrant colors had dulled to a sickly rust, the paint chipped away by years of neglect.

I heard the chant again, Leah’s voice in my head, but it wasn’t the words that startled me—it was the way they *felt*. The words were like a key turning in a lock. As soon as the chant filled my mind, the playground seemed to *wake*.

The air around the merry-go-round thickened, pressing in on me like a heavy, suffocating blanket. I didn’t have time to think—before I knew it, I was standing on the platform, my feet unsteady, and I could hear the soft echo of children’s laughter in the distance. It was faint, but it wasn’t just any laughter—it was *wrong*. It sounded too high-pitched, too *sharp*, like it was coming from underwater, or maybe from somewhere far darker. Even though everything felt foggy, I knew that I had to play the game. If there was any chance of me going home, I had to play.

""Don’t touch it,"" Leah’s voice whispered, her excitement building. ""Not yet. Just wait for it to start. Hold on tight, and don’t let go.""

I was alone but I knew I wasn’t. In the deepest distance I could hear that groan that haunted me as a child. Terror gripped me as the playground seemed to shift in the moonlight. I wanted to run but then I heard it. The voice was soft, it could have been in my head but it broke through the fog.

“Don’t leave me again, Ethan.”

I stepped forward, placing my foot on the merry-go-round, and instantly, it groaned beneath me, the sound low and ominous, like the groan of something ancient. I wasn’t sure if it was the weight of the chant or the pull of something deeper, but I *felt* it.

“Round and round, we spin and fall, the shadows call, the game begins,” I chanted as assured as I could.

 The merry-go-round started moving—slowly at first, just a hint of motion beneath my feet. How it could even do that was a mystery to me. It should have broken off its pivot but there was a perceptible tug on it. Then, with a lurch, it began to spin.

It began to move, and I leaned forward to keep my balance. I wasn’t supposed to touch it yet. I knew that much. The merry-go-round spun with a force I couldn’t comprehend, pulling me into its dizzying spiral. I should have been thrown off, but the laws of physics failed to work. I felt myself being pulled to the center of the children’s play toy. The ground beneath it seemed to dissolve, replaced by a swirling void that looked like it could swallow everything whole. My heart pounded in my chest, and I knew it was time, so I clung to one of the bars, the metal cold and slick in my grip, as the force of the spin tried to pull me into the center. I crouched and hung on for dear life.

The chant echoed in my head again, louder now, weaving its way into my thoughts like an unstoppable force. ""Round and round, we spin and fall, the shadows call, the game begins."" The words seemed to reach out, clawing at me, making the air grow colder and heavier. The darkness below me felt endless, like I could fall forever. The laughter—the wrong, shrill laughter—swirled around me, a chorus of voices calling my name, calling me to *join* them.

I gritted my teeth, refusing to let go, my hands slick with sweat as I held on. The spin continued, faster, until I thought my arms would snap from the strain. And then, just as quickly as it started, it slowed. The world came back into focus, the void beneath me faded away, and the merry-go-round finally came to a stop, leaving me breathless and shaken, heart still pounding in my chest.

But the words—the chant—lingered. It was like they were still hanging in the air around me, waiting for the next step.

I did not realize I had my eyes until I heard her voice. Hearing it again brought tears to my eyes and I opened them.

“Ethan.”

I looked around and could not see her but I knew I heard her voice. The cracked asphalt looked like it had been pulled from the very bowels of the earth, the fissures oozing something dark and thick, like tar or blood, which stained the edges of the playground. The stench was suffocating, a rancid blend of decay and rot that made my stomach twist. I stumbled off, gasping for air, but there was no time to recover. Instinct dragging me toward the sandbox, dragging me deeper into this grotesque nightmare.

The sandbox had long been overtaken, the weeds now thick and gnarly, their twisted stalks curling like blackened fingers, reaching for me. But beneath the weeds, the sand still shifted, though not like it should. It moved unnaturally, as if something beneath it was alive, *waiting*, pulling the grains toward a hidden abyss. My feet sank into the sand as I stepped forward, the ground giving way like the soft belly of a rotting corpse. My hands trembled as I dropped to my knees and dug, the sand shifting around my fingers in sickening waves. And then I felt them—cold and brittle.

Bones.

Small, fragile bones.

I dug harder, the sound of cracking bone sickening, until I uncovered them fully. They weren’t just bones—they were *wrong*. Fragile and delicate, but they didn’t feel like they belonged to any living thing. The moment my fingers touched them, they crumbled to dust, blackened ash sticking to my skin like burnt remnants of something long forgotten. My breath caught in my throat as I scrambled back, heart racing, but the sand didn’t stop. It *shifted* again, curling and writhing, and as if in response, words began to form.

*The shadows watch; they’ll take their due.*  
*Finish the game, or they’ll take you too.*

The words burned into me, the very air around me turning cold, as if the temperature itself had dropped a hundred degrees. I looked up, chest heaving, and froze. The shadows,they stretched unnaturally long, too long, reaching across the ground like claws scraping at the earth. Their edges curled like smoke, flickering in and out of focus. But they weren’t just shadows anymore, they were *figures*. Children, but not the kind of children I remember. Their eyes were hollow, like empty sockets filled with darkness. Their limbs were twisted, bent at impossible angles, flickering like old film, jerky and uneven. They didn’t move closer, but I could feel them,feel their eyes burning in to me. They were unblinking. They were hungry. The air thickened with their silent watching, the suffocating pressure of their gaze, as if they were *waiting* for something. That groan. That damn groan echoed so close to me that it caused me to tremble uncontrollably.

I knew, deep down, that they weren’t just shadows, they were *them*. The children who had been lost. The ones who hadn’t gone home. They had never *left*.

Leah's form flickered into view, not like how I remembered her—bright and full of life—but hazy, like a dream I could barely grasp. Her voice came to me, soft and uncertain, like a child trying to explain something too big for their small world.

“Ethan,” she whispered, her voice trembling in the air around me. “I didn’t... I didn’t know… I thought we were playing.” She hesitated, her figure twisting in the air, the edges of her fading in and out like she wasn’t sure how to hold herself together. *“But it wasn’t just a game, was it”*

I felt her confusion, her pain, swirling in the air like a cold wind. She sounded like the Leah I knew, but there was something off about the way she spoke now. Like she was trying to put together pieces of a puzzle she didn’t quite understand herself.

“I played the game by myself,” she said, her voice was barely above a whisper, and I could hear the sorrow in her tone.” I wasn’t supposed to. It told me not to, but I did it anyway. I was supposed to play with you, but I wanted to play alone.” Leah’s trailed off, and I could feel her fear, raw and unfiltered, like the first time she realized what was happening. “It took me, Ethan. It took me and I didn’t know..”

I took a step back, trying to process what she was saying, but it didn’t make sense. She sounded so young, so lost, like a child trying to understand a story that was too big for her.

“What now?” I asked her, my voice breaking looking at the little girl I once loved as a child.

“You must play the game, Ethan. You must. The game has to be finished.”

Her form flickered again. “I’ve been waiting for you to come back... so we can finish it.” Her words rushed out, a mix of desperation and childlike hope, like she didn’t fully understand what she was asking me to do, but it was all she had left.

I wanted to scream, to tell her it wasn’t possible, that she was gone and trapped in this place. But the words stuck in my throat, and I could feel her eyes on me, wide and pleading, like a child who didn’t realize the full weight of what she was asking.

“Please, Ethan...” Her voice was so small now, barely a whisper. “You have to come back... come back and finish it. We have to finish the game. We have to finish before you also break the rules.”

Her figure trembled and flickered once more, her eyes wide with an innocence that twisted into something darker, something I couldn’t ignore. It wasn’t just a game. It was something far worse.

“I played it wrong, Ethan. But you can still win.”

The ground beneath me seemed to tremble as her words echoed in my mind. I didn’t want to, didn’t want to play this game with her, not like this. But I could feel her—waiting, wanting, urging me toward something I couldn’t quite understand.

And somewhere deep inside, I knew I had no choice. The game wasn’t over. It was only waiting for me to return.

I felt the weight of Leah’s gaze pressing into me, her flickering form trembling in the air around me. Her voice came again, soft but desperate, as though the words were being forced from her, one by one, like an old, worn riddle she couldn’t shake.

“The rules...” she said slowly, almost like she was piecing them together in her mind. “You have to play hide-and-seek now, Ethan. If you are found. You stay.”

The words hung in the air, sickeningly familiar, but now twisted into something far darker. I didn’t know if she understood what it meant, what it *really* meant, or if she was just trying to hold on to some vestige of what was once innocent. But the fear in her voice, the fear in the way she trembled, made it clear: this wasn’t the game we used to play.

Before I could respond, a shrill, high-pitched laugh echoed through the air—sharp, wrong, like a child’s laughter stretched too thin and distorted until it became something monstrous. I froze. The sound crawled up my spine and dug deep, making my heart race.

I turned toward the sound, my blood running cold as I saw a small figure emerge from the shadows, barely visible at first. The thing—whatever it was—was hunched over, its limbs twisted in a grotesque parody of a child’s posture. Its eyes were wide, black pits that seemed to stare straight into me. And then the voice came, sweet but sinister, a child's chant that held all the weight of something far older:

*""Ready or not, here I come,*  
*You can run, but you can’t outrun,*  
*If I find you, you’ll be mine,*  
*So stay with me—your fate, entwined.""*

My blood froze. The countdown had begun, and I had no time to think. I bolted, my heart pounding in my chest, feeling the ground tremble beneath me. I couldn’t go back to the playground, couldn’t risk being caught there. The only place that made sense was the edge of the woods, just beyond the park. It was against the rules. But then, the rules didn’t matter, not really. Not anymore.

We used to cheat in the game, laughing about it, running into the woods where the shadows were thick enough to swallow us whole. Back then, it was just part of the game—part of the fun. But now, I hoped, I *prayed* that the thing that haunted this place was bound by those old rules too. I needed it to be, for my own sanity.

I reached the trees, my breath ragged, my legs burning from the effort. I glanced over my shoulder, but the twisted children were already moving toward the playground, searching, scanning. I ducked low, crouching behind the thick trunks, cradling Leah—small, fragile Leah—in my arms. She felt too light, too cold in my grasp. Her form was fading, flickering, but her eyes... her eyes were wide and full of fear, still so childlike, so innocent.

“We can’t let them find you...” Leah whispered, her voice barely audible, as she buried her face into my chest.

I held her tighter, my heart hammering in my chest as I listened to the footsteps of the shadow children. The sounds of their search—scratching against the old slide, their whispering voices—sent waves of cold terror through me. They were close.

I spotted the slide just beyond the treeline, the wooden support still in place, as it had been when we played as kids. A perfect hiding spot, one of the best we’d ever found. But I knew the risk. If they saw me moving, if they caught even a glimpse of me, it would be over. I took a shaky breath and, cradling Leah as carefully as I could, moved toward the slide.

We just made it behind the wooden beams in time. I could hear their footsteps getting closer, the scraping of something unnatural skimming the ground, but I didn’t dare look. I held my breath, my pulse thundering in my ears as I pressed Leah close to me. We were so close to being found.

The seconds felt like hours. I could feel her heart beating in time with mine, a fragile rhythm that kept us tethered to the world of the living. The shadows were so close. So close. One more step and—

I heard it. The shift in the air, the ripple in reality that made everything seem to falter, to stretch and snap like an old film reel. The ground trembled beneath me, and then, just as quickly as it had begun, everything stopped.

Leah’s voice, small but filled with relief, fluttered in the air around me. “You did it, Ethan... You won...” She smiled, though it was a strange, unearthly smile—too wide, too knowing for a child. “You can go home now.”

But as she spoke those words, the weight of the moment hung in the air, thick and heavy. I knew the game was over... for now. But something in Leah’s tone, something in the way she smiled, made me realize this was never the end.

I released Leah and she took a few steps back, her form solidying into the unruly child with bright eyes and wild pony tail. Her eyes—those wide, innocent eyes—stared up at me with a mixture of sadness.

“I’ll take you back, Leah,” I whispered, my voice shaking, but resolute. I left her once; I wasn’t going to leave her again. “We’ll leave this place together. I’ll make sure it never hurts you again. I promise. I’m grown up now! And I’ll take care of you just like I promised back then.”

Her small hand—so cold, so light—rested gently in my hand, and she smiled, but it was not the smile I remembered. It was something different, something hollow and sad. Her voice came soft, almost as if she were speaking through a veil of grief.

“You can’t,” she said, her words curling around me like smoke. “I broke the rules a long time ago, Ethan. I told you. I was the one who played alone... and now, I belong to it.”

I felt the air grow colder around me, a pressure building in my chest. A sudden weight seemed to settle on my heart, pulling me down.

“No,” I murmured, shaking my head desperately. “That’s not true. I can still save you. I can get you out of here. We’ll go back. You’ll be safe. We’ll go home.”

But Leah’s expression softened, and she shook her head, her eyes glistening with something that could have been sorrow, or something far darker, something ancient.

“It’s already too late, Ethan,” she said gently, as though explaining something that was far beyond my understanding. “It’s already taken me. It’s been so long, and I’ve been waiting for you. Just seeing you again before I fade completely.”

I felt something twist inside me, an aching knot of grief, of helplessness. She had been waiting for me. She had been alone, all this time, trapped in this place where the game never ended. Where the rules were twisted, perverted by something ancient and hungry. It had aged her in ways I hadn’t expected. I looked up then, instinctively, drawn to the edge of the woods. And that’s when I saw it.

At the edge of the trees, just out of reach of the light, there was something impossibly large, stretching beyond comprehension. It was a shadow, or perhaps many shadows, writhing together, indistinguishable from one another, but each one moving in ways that defied the laws of nature. The shape of it was grotesque, an endless mass of limbs and whispers, groaning, the sound that had haunted my childhood, echoing through the air like a thousand suffering souls.

I staggered back, my chest tightening with terror.

“That...” I whispered, voice trembling. “That’s... what took you. It’s still here. I—I can’t leave you to it, Leah.”

Leah’s form flickered harder as if she was beginning to fade completely. Her voice seemed to come from all around me, like a breeze whispering through the leaves.

“You can’t save me, Ethan. I’m already lost to it. It’s too late... but you...” She trailed off, a warmth spreading across her face, a moment of peace. “I saved you.”

I swallowed hard, my throat tight. Every part of me wanted to run, to save her, to drag her away from this nightmare. But as I looked at her—really looked at her—I saw the truth in her eyes.

She was right.

The shadows at the edge of the woods shifted again, and I felt them pull at me, pulling me toward the darkness, like a magnet of dread. My chest tightened, and I knew I couldn’t stay here, not any longer. But I didn’t want to leave her.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “I’ll find a way. I’ll fix this.”

Leah’s smile softened, and I could swear I saw a tear shimmer in her eye, though it vanished as quickly as it came.

“Thank you, Ethan,” she murmured, almost too softly to hear. “But it’s... it’s enough. Just knowing you’re here, just knowing you care... I can let go now.”

And then, as if she had never been there at all, Leah faded into the air, leaving only the hollow, lingering feeling of loss and sorrow in her place.

I stood there for a long moment, staring at the empty space where she had been. The weight of the shadows pressed on me, and I could hear the groaning grow louder, the monstrous thing waiting just out of sight. I turned, my heart heavy with the knowledge that I couldn’t save her, couldn’t undo what had been done.

But I could still try to escape. I could still try to survive.

The shadows pressed in around me, suffocating in their weight, but something stirred in my mind—like a flicker of light in a dark room. I remembered the rhyme. Leah’s voice echoed in my head, soft and unyielding, despite the horrors surrounding me:

*""To escape, you must go down where they once slid,*  
*Through the hollow, the dark, where the others hid.""*

The slide. It had always been there, towering in the corner of the playground, a darkened tunnel of metal that twisted into the unknown. I had never thought to go down it before, never dared to. But now, the rhyme had given me a path, a way out. At least, that’s what I told myself.

My heart pounded as I turned toward the slide, the one place I had always avoided. The dark hole at the top seemed to leer at me, waiting, promising nothing good. It was different now. The slide wasn’t just an object; it was a doorway. A gateway into something unspeakable. And it was calling me.

I took a step toward it, the air around me heavy with the scent of mildew and decay. The slide groaned under the weight of the past, as if it had been waiting for me all this time. Each step felt like it was pulling me deeper into the nightmare, but I couldn’t stop. The rhyme played over and over in my mind, like a chant that forced my legs to move.

I climbed the ladder slowly, my hands slick with sweat, the metal cold under my fingertips. The laughter, distorted and far away echoed in the distance. It wasn’t the children’s laughter anymore. It was something else. Something hungry.

Reaching the top, I hesitated. The opening at the top of the slide was black, as if it led straight into the void. I could feel the darkness pressing against me, just out of sight, like a thousand eyes watching. It took everything in me to push forward, to crouch and lower myself into the dark tunnel.

The instant I began to slide, the world changed. The air became thick, like molasses, dragging me downward, the sensation so wrong that I felt my insides twist with panic. The slide was too tight, too narrow, the walls closing in on me. It didn’t feel like metal beneath me; it felt like something alive—slick and writhing, pulling me deeper, faster, until I could barely breathe.

And then, the sounds started. Whispers. Low, guttural murmurs that echoed inside the slide. Voices. Children’s voices. Leah’s voice. They weren’t calling to me, though. They were calling for something else, something far worse, and it was too late for me to stop it now. I couldn’t move. I was trapped in the slide, racing toward whatever waited at the end.

My heart hammered, my chest tight, but I couldn’t scream. My mouth was dry, my breath coming in sharp gasps. The slide jerked suddenly, and I thought for a moment that I would be ripped apart, that I would be crushed in the dark. But then, just as quickly as it began, it stopped.

The world around me had shifted. It was the same, but different. The air was still heavy, but there was a faint light now, a glow that came from nowhere and everywhere at once. It was as if I had crossed some threshold, some boundary between what was real and what was not.

The light that filtered through the trees was soft at first, a faint glow creeping into the corners of the world. It felt like a new day was beginning, but I knew better. It wasn’t the start of anything. The sun’s rise didn’t erase what had happened. The warmth on my skin felt foreign, like a reminder that the world had moved on without me, while I was still trapped in the echo of that game.

I stood there, staring out into the quiet woods. The shadows had receded, but their presence lingered, like a weight pressing against my chest. Leah’s voice, her laughter, the rhyme—it all felt so distant now, like a fading dream I couldn’t remember clearly.

Her fate was sealed, and I couldn’t save her. I hadn’t been able to save her when it had mattered, and I wouldn’t be able to save her now. The truth of it was worse than the unanswered questions. The not-knowing had always gnawed at me, like an itch I couldn’t scratch, but to face the truth—that she was lost to that place, bound to something ancient and hungry—was a kind of pain I couldn’t escape.

I thought I might feel relief, as if the horror were behind me, but I didn’t. I felt... empty.

The sun continued its slow climb, casting golden light on the twisted trunks of trees, on the damp earth where the shadows had once stretched so long and so dark. The world around me was peaceful now, but I knew it wasn’t real peace. It was a fragile kind of calm, like the stillness after a storm before the next one hits.

And the worst part? I knew, deep down, that I would never be free of it. Not really. There was no going back to the way things were before. The game wasn’t over. It had only moved on, waiting for the next player.

I just hoped it would be a long time before someone else had to take my [place](https://www.reddit.com/r/JonathanS223/)."

I don't really remember too many lyrics or details about it as I was a young child in Pre-K/Kindergarten. I know that during nap time the teachers would play this song to help us go to sleep. All I remember about this particular song is something about a coin and maybe a sandbox/something to do with sand? And I think it was counting down or just counting in general. Although like I said some of these details may be a bit inaccurate te since I was young and don't remember it that well.

I think I figured it all out.,minecraftlore,1hxmnzd,2025-01-09 15:40:36,10,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftlore/comments/1hxmnzd/i_think_i_figured_it_all_out/,Hagarian_335,End,"I think I just pieced together the Minecraft Lore, especially regarding the End and the nature of the End.

As a disclaimer, I will be using a lot of ideas from Game Theory’s video on the complete story of Minecraft. If you would like to watch the video, you can find it in their channel.

But summarizing what the video says, the Minecraft timeline begins with the Piglin Invasion from Minecraft Legends. The Hosts, the gods of the Overworld, summon a group of humans from the future to fend off against the Piglin forces. Then, when the war is won, the Hosts leave the humans to their own devices to “explore new worlds”. 

Those humans would multiply and multiply, eventually splitting into tribes and kingdoms, the most notable ones being the Desert Kingdom and Savannah Tribe. They began to experiment with the world’s resources, which really ruined the ecosystem, flooding the entire Savannah Tribe as they searched for a way to bring back the gods with what we now know as the Ocean Monuments, but to no avail. They would go on to become the Drowned.

Noticing how things were on a downward slope, the Desert Tribe forged an alliance with the Illagers, who taught them the power of soul and how to harness it to create life, examples being the Guardians, Blazes, and Breezes… more on the Breeze later. They invaded the Nether a second time, hoping to collect Soul Sand and create a new God out of soul power; one who would magically solve all their problems. The result was the Wither, which chased the people into the underground, where they built the Ancient City. Using what the Illagers taught them, they created Breezes and built the Trial Chambers in an effort to train an army potent enough to kill the Wither.

But it failed. The Wither easily blasted through the army, and the nameless kingdom was forced to activate a portal to the Sculk Dimension. This brought in the Warden, which killed the Wither, but also began killing hundreds of people for making noise. That’s why the city is covered in Sculk… because it absorbs soul. The remaining survivors that escaped the Warden built the Strongholds and ran away to the End, where they were corrupted into Endermen over time. The other ancient builders slowly died off too, becoming the Zombies and Skeletons. 

The Illagers, idolizing the kingdom that had fled to the End, waited in the Overworld patiently for their heroes to return, but to no avail. So they began doing whatever necessary to bring them back, building fake replicas of the End Portal and other such structures. Eventually, this led them into violence, pillaging the Villages of the Overworld, kidnapping Villagers and injecting Lapis into their brains to turn them into Vindicators, distorting other Villagers into Ravagers, merging Allays into Vexes, et cetera. 

Thousands of years later, Minecraft takes place. You uncover remnants of the ancient civilizations you come from, and ultimately what happened to them. Nothing of importance happens in Minecraft, since it’s more sandbox than story.

This is where Game Theory’s ideas end. Now it’s all me.

After you defeat the Ender Dragon, things start to change. The few remaining humans begin to repopulate slowly, and technology greatly advances. Cue Minecraft Dungeons. Hypnotized by the power of a mysterious orb called the Orb of Dominance, Archie the Arch-Illager united the Illagers in an attempt to conquer the whole Overworld… but a team of brave heroes stops him in his tracks. The Orb of Dominance then takes matters into its own hands, revealing itself as the “Heart of Ender”. The next few DLCs, culminating in the Echoing Void DLC, revolve around the heroes chasing down the Heart of Ender to stop it once and for all. 

See, this is a satisfactory narrative of the Minecraft storyline, but I always had one question. 

How on earth did the ancient builders find their way into the End? There was no sign of the End even existing in the Overworld, unlike the Nether, which left behind its broken portals and such. Moreover, in the book “The Rise of the Arch-Illager”, it is the Heart of Ender that tells Archie how to build Highblock Castle, then the book specifically states that it felt as though the castle had always been there… as if it were ancient. 

This means that the Heart of Ender had *seen* Highblock Castle before in the far past, and knew how to rebuild it. But wait… how is that possible? The only people we know of that were under the grasp of the Orb were the Piglins and the Illagers… right?

Well, the book mentions that the castle was always there. The real question is, who built it? One might say the ancient Illagers did, but they couldn’t have. The book explicitly mentions that the Illagers had never really handed together under one leader before Archie came along, and therefore it wouldn’t make sense for them to have built such a large castle, with a throne room. So if not the Illagers, who? Only one viable option remains…

The Ancient Builders. 

Stay with me now. Here’s what I propose.

The humans, after defeating the Piglins in Legends, took the Orb of Dominance from them… they were mentally stronger than the Piglins, right? They could handle the orb… but as they advanced in technology, the Heart continued to speak to them and influence them, making them ruin the ecosystem. It foiled their attempts to bring back the Hosts by melting ice caps and flooding the Ocean Monuments, it ruined ecosystems, it rarified ores like Diamonds and Emeralds, et cetera… until finally, getting the builders desperate enough, it taught them how to access the End. There they were corrupted into Endermen, who are canonically trying to bring about the collapse of every dimension (according to the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design). Then the Orb returned to the Overworld, patiently waiting for a new unfortunate soul to come up so it could cause further destruction to the Overworld… and it found one in Archie.

This leaves one last question. Why???

The answer is simple. The Heart of Ender is called, well, the Heart OF ENDER. Ender’s Heart. And what are the Eyes of Ender called? Eyes OF ENDER. Ender’s Eyes. The one behind the schemes of the Heart of Ender is none other than the owner of the Heart itself, some mysterious figure named Ender. 

We know nothing about Ender. But based on what I’ve mentioned above, we know two things… for some reason they shattered into different parts, including the Eyes and the Heart, and that its Heart is hell-bent on ending the world.

What if the entire Minecraft storyline, at the end of the day (no pun intended), is about this “evil host” Ender trying to expand the End to all dimensions, including the Overworld, Nether, and more, maybe in an effort to re-assemble itself? 

The idea doesn’t seem too far-fetched, at least to me.

Hope that made sense to you all! If you don’t believe my theory anyway, I at least hope you found it amusing to read!

I think I just pieced together the Minecraft Lore,Minecraft,1hxmkzi,2025-01-09 15:37:03,3,0.64,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hxmkzi/i_think_i_just_pieced_together_the_minecraft_lore/,Hagarian_335,Discussion,"I genuinely think I just pieced together the full Minecraft Lore

Okay, I already know what a lot of you might be thinking. “Minecraft? Lore? You’ve gotta be joking.”

But nope, I’m dead serious with y’all. Minecraft does in fact have an overarching plot, if you can believe it.

As a disclaimer, I will be using a lot of ideas from Game Theory’s video on the complete story of Minecraft. If you would like to watch the video, you can find it in their channel.

But summarizing what the video says, the Minecraft timeline begins with the Piglin Invasion from Minecraft Legends. The Hosts, the gods of the Overworld, summon a group of humans from the future to fend off against the Piglin forces. Then, when the war is won, the Hosts leave the humans to their own devices to “explore new worlds”. 

Those humans would multiply and multiply, eventually splitting into tribes and kingdoms, the most notable ones being the Desert Kingdom and Savannah Tribe. They began to experiment with the world’s resources, which really ruined the ecosystem, flooding the entire Savannah Tribe as they searched for a way to bring back the gods with what we now know as the Ocean Monuments, but to no avail. They would go on to become the Drowned.

Noticing how things were on a downward slope, the Desert Tribe forged an alliance with the Illagers, who taught them the power of soul and how to harness it to create life, examples being the Guardians, Blazes, and Breezes… more on the Breeze later. They invaded the Nether a second time, hoping to collect Soul Sand and create a new God out of soul power; one who would magically solve all their problems. The result was the Wither, which chased the people into the underground, where they built the Ancient City. Using what the Illagers taught them, they created Breezes and built the Trial Chambers in an effort to train an army potent enough to kill the Wither.

But it failed. The Wither easily blasted through the army, and the nameless kingdom was forced to activate a portal to the Sculk Dimension. This brought in the Warden, which killed the Wither, but also began killing hundreds of people for making noise. That’s why the city is covered in Sculk… because it absorbs soul.

Stressed beardie?,BeardedDragon,1hx4miw,2025-01-08 23:21:29,73,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hx4miw,New_Beardie_mom,,"Rupert Poopert has been getting darker than normal even when he is under his heat lamp basking. First couple pictures are from when his lights were already off but are representative of where he is getting dark. Picture towards the end is his normal colors. 

He slept in his sandbox for over two days and I thought he might be going into brumation. Then I thought that maybe Rupert is a she and felt “his” belly for eggs and couldn’t feel anything. I got worried because I know he had not pooped for a few days before he decided crash out for a couple of days. So I gave him a warm bath and he took a massive poo with some hard urate. Since the bath yesterday he has been moving around and basking again but still is getting this new dark pattern. Worried that something might be off with my husbandry? I know I need to move away from paper towels, but he poops in the same spot and it is so easy to clean. He spends most of his time on his basking spot or in his sandbox that takes up half his terrarium.

Here is his current set up:
*4x2x2 terrarium- half sandbox with Australian desert sand half is paper towels
*heat lamp over his basking rock 100-103 degrees
*34” Arcadia D3+ Desert 12% UVB 
*Additional heat lamp on the hot side to keep gradient temps
*Jungle dawn LED light
FOOD: I have a hydroponic garden and grow Chard, Collard greens, arugula, and tatsoi. He gets a mix everyday. Occasionally I will give him small amounts of yellow squash, carrots or yellow bell pepper. 
Bugs are mainly Dubia but also gets hornworms or super worms on occasion. I sprinkle Repashy Calcium LoD on his bugs and have been sprinkling his salad too since he isn’t eating as many bugs. 

I have been cutting his bugs back because he is getting chonky and I think he is getting close to a year old. He has always had a bigger belly. Took him to the vet about six months ago and checked for parasites and tested positive. We did the meds and got a clear fecal. 

Sorry for the novel. Rupert is my first beardie and want to give him the best life possible. Wondering if he is getting dehydrated? He has water but I have never seen him drink it. Every now and then I drop water on the end of his nose to try to get some water in him. Also will give some squash and hornworms to try to get him hydrated. Any tips or ideas would be appreciated! "
Assassins Creed Mirage is not a good stealth game.,assassinscreed,1hwzce8,2025-01-08 19:08:07,0,0.4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hwzce8/assassins_creed_mirage_is_not_a_good_stealth_game/,Beau2488,// Discussion,"Ok, so I bought Mirage on release after hearing that it was a return to a simpler, more focused, stealth friendly title.

I bounced off almost immediately after the first few missions but wasn't really sure why I felt the way I did. I've returned to it about half a dozen times over the last few months to try and find the fun but this last experience with the game has helped me understand why I think this game just flat out sucks as an Assassins Creed game.

In terms of a stealth experience, Mirage is just too artificial. With each mission and contract, I can just see the hands of the designer and how they want you to approach the encounters, like a ""best way"" to play. The guard routines, their placement, the environmental traps etc. It doesn't feel like a sandbox for me to approach the way I want to, it all feels like I either follow the designers approach or just have a bad time. 

The encounters feel like mini puzzles to be solved, rather than offering true dynamic stealth gameplay. ""Ok he's standing under the crane full of boxes, that guy is standing just the perfect distance for me to whistle from this hay bale and kill him, these 2 guys follow this set path and then split right at that moment for me to do the thing the designer wants me to do"".

In addition to that, the ""social"" stealth options are non existent and are entirely gated around a requiring a currency to activate, adding to the overall feeling of just being lifeless and artificial. Social stealth should be immergent and dynamic, not feel like the designers have added just added them for the sake of adding them and then locking them behind a paywall basically. If you want me to interact with these gameplay opportunities, just let me use the currency these people would actually want if they were real people in this world. Why do a mob of people require that I pay them some random token before they ""activate"" on their pre destined path. It's so stupid.

Lastly, the tools available to me to open up stealth and make my own fun are non existent. I'm 15 hours in and I still only have a throwing knife. That's it! Where are my smoke bombs, or blood bombs or coins or anything I can use to open up new dynamic opportunities for myself? I can throw a knife to kill a guy, or drop a bag of sand on a guy, or blow up a bomb, all of which are ""go loud"" options and I don't want to go loud! I want to be a sneaky assassin, not feel like I'm just constrained to what has been clearly laid out for me.

So yeah, Assassins Creed Mirage, for me, really sucks. Its not a fun stealth game, it's a lifeless, boring, artificial experience where the hands of the designers are felt everywhere you go, rather than feel like a proper stealth sandbox. I really hope things change for Shadows because I can't stand the way this game feels."

SOLVED (kinda) The problem was the blood itself. I had to go to bannerlord ini file and disable the blood.

Hi all. I'm having trouble with my weapons in Bannerlord. The weapons are bugging out and honestly I'm out of ideas, so I was wondering if someone smarter than me could help me on this one. What's going on with these textures? They seem to be random at best. I've tried to do a clean install, and deleting the shader files, as for some it helped, couple of times now, with no success. It plays fine for a little time and then it comes back.

However, BTC encountered resistance when trying to break through the psychological level of 100 thousand USD and suffered a slight correction.

According to data from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) , Bitcoin is trading at $99,320, up 1.6% daily and 6.0% weekly.

https://preview.redd.it/1vlm4bbu0ebe1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc91c8d3dfd7e1743dbba4f34c57c17135ec5e67

The asset was boosted by strong inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and held onto a good portion of its gains recorded over the weekend. Despite resistance near the $100,000 barrier, BTC is showing consistent appreciation, with its market cap surpassing $1.96 trillion and a 53.4% ​​dominance over altcoins, according to data from CoinGecko.

Last week was marked by high volatility for Bitcoin. After hitting a monthly low of $91,300 at the start of the period, the asset experienced intense fluctuations, including a drop to $93,000 at the start of the year.

However, the cryptocurrency regained strength, surpassing $97,000 on January 2 and subsequently reaching its most recent peak of $99,800.

# Bitcoin rises, altcoins post mixed performance

While Bitcoin is once again exciting investors, the altcoin market has shown mixed results over the same period. Ethereum (ETH), for example, remains stable, trading above $3,600, with a daily appreciation of 1.1%.

Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) remains above $215, up nearly 1% on a daily basis. Other large cryptocurrencies such as XRP, BNB, DOGE, Cardano, Tron, and LINK saw small daily gains. All of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap are trading higher this morning.

Among the largest-cap altcoins, the highlights of the day are:

* **Injective (INJ)**: +12,6%
* **The Sandbox (SAND)**: 9,7%
* **Filecoin (FIL)** : 8.4%
* **Yield (YEAR)** : 8.2%
* **Pudgy Penguins (PENGU)** : 7.2%
* **FACT** : 6.7%
* **Avalanche (AVAX)** : 6.4%

Only SUI and PEPE are trading lower at the time of writing.

The total value of the cryptocurrency market grew by $30 billion over the past 24 hours, reaching $3.68 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Despite the resistance faced by Bitcoin, the market as a whole is showing signs of recovery, with most assets maintaining modest gains or stability in the short term.

* Both have had different versions of themselves battle in the comics…3 times in fact.

Track Name: 

* “Hunt Of The Bat”

Dialogue: 

* This could mostly be Batman listening to Alfred on comms and possibly Gordon as well. However Scarface himself could also play audio clips himself maybe some from his game with lines like “I'm the boss of this city, you ugly son of a bitch!” Or “What I’ve done to men, you wouldn’t believe“ hell maybe even some lines said throughout the Arkham games themselves

Animation/ Fight Potential: 

* The fight definitely has 3D potential for it. While it definitely might be easy to say it would similar to Boba Fett vs Predator is recommended seeing it more in the same way as Snake vs Sam with a mixture of melee to weapons and even traps only it could potentially be throughout an entire city since both do come from sand box games

Music: 

* Difficult to say right off the bat but it could go to a way similar to Boba Fett vs Predator with a mix of Predator and Star Wars tones only with it now as Predator and Batman tunes mixes or could go more like how Solid Snake Vs Sam Fisher went with a song mixed in before going into a full orchestral score

Debatably: 

* At first glance it could seem like Predator could win this easily but given the various upgrades and feats that Arkham Batman has achieved over his games not to mention his usage of the Batmobile (which while a big thing isn’t necessarily a huge advantage as Scarface has defeated mechs about that same strength as well), he could have a chance of possibly winning this but regardless of the winner it’s looking to be a highly difficult fight"
AI Mastery: A Comprehensive Guide to Using ChatGPT,u_IllPause4880,1ht2jjs,2025-01-03 20:09:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IllPause4880/comments/1ht2jjs/ai_mastery_a_comprehensive_guide_to_using_chatgpt/,IllPause4880,,"# ""This doesn’t feel intuitive to me—I don’t think I’ll ever truly ‘get it.’""

As a project manager overseeing a team of skilled craftsmen, I understand the feeling of being out of place. Imagine coordinating the grinding, sanding, polishing, and lifting of marble every single day. My team’s hands are their tools, and our workspace is a symphony of dust and noise.

Fast forward to today, and I find myself navigating the digital realm, trying to make sense of AI tools for project management. It's akin to swapping a blueprint for a digital dashboard - talk about a learning curve!

# The Digital Leap: From Stone to Screen

When I first encountered AI, it felt like stepping into a foreign land. The tools promised to simplify my life, yet they seemed to speak a language I didn’t understand. Overcoming AI learning challenges felt akin to deciphering ancient hieroglyphs. But here’s the thing: just like mastering the art of stone, developing AI communication skills is a journey, not a sprint.

# 

# Embracing the AI Learning Curve

Navigating AI learning curves is much like managing an on-site project. You start with a blueprint, but the real magic happens in the execution. You fumble, you adjust, and eventually, you find your rhythm. Here’s how I approached it:

* **Start Small:** Just as I wouldn’t tackle a massive marble sculpture on day one, I began with simple AI tasks. This helped build confidence with AI tools. Starting small allows you to understand the basics without feeling overwhelmed. It’s about laying a solid foundation. For instance, I began by automating simple tasks like sorting emails or setting reminders. These small victories built my confidence and prepared me for more complex challenges.
* **Experiment Freely:** Think of AI as a sandbox. Play around, make mistakes, and learn from them. It’s all part of improving AI interaction skills. The beauty of AI is in its flexibility and adaptability. By experimenting, you discover new functionalities and creative ways to apply AI to everyday problems. I often set aside time to explore new AI software, trying out different features without the fear of failure. This experimentation phase is crucial for innovation and growth.
* **Seek Guidance:** Just as I’d consult a fellow craftsman, I reached out to online communities and forums. The shared wisdom is invaluable. Engaging with a community of like-minded individuals can provide insights that you might not have considered. I joined several AI forums and attended webinars where experts shared their experiences and tips. This not only expanded my knowledge but also connected me with a network of supportive peers who were on similar journeys.

By embracing these steps, I gradually became more proficient in using AI, transforming initial challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation. The journey is ongoing, and each day brings new learning experiences.

# Crafting Effective AI Prompt Strategies

In the world of stone, precision is key. The same goes for AI. Crafting effective AI prompt strategies is about asking the right questions. Imagine AI as a curious apprentice eager to learn from you. Here’s what worked for me:

* **Be Specific:** Instead of vague requests, I learned to provide detailed prompts. For instance, “Help me write an email to my boss explaining why I need an extension on a deadline.” Being specific helps the AI understand the context and deliver more accurate and relevant responses. When you specify the tone, style, or even the length of the response you desire, it guides the AI to tailor its output to your needs. This specificity reduces ambiguity and enhances the quality of the interaction.
* **Iterate and Refine:** Treat prompts like drafts. If the output isn’t quite right, tweak it. It’s a collaborative process. Iteration is crucial because it allows you to refine your prompts based on the AI's responses. By analyzing what works and what doesn’t, you can adjust your approach to achieve better results. This iterative process is akin to sculpting; each refinement brings you closer to the desired outcome. Remember, the first attempt might not be perfect, but with each iteration, the prompt becomes more effective.
* **Stay Curious:** Curiosity fuels creativity. Don’t be afraid to explore new angles and approaches. Curiosity encourages you to experiment with different types of prompts and explore various possibilities. By maintaining a curious mindset, you open yourself to discovering innovative ways to interact with AI. This exploration can lead to unexpected insights and creative solutions that you might not have considered initially.

# Latest Best Practices from Experts

One relevant program that aligns with the chapter on crafting effective AI prompt strategies is OpenAI's GPT-4o. As of the latest updates, experts recommend the following best practices for using GPT-4o effectively:

1. **Contextual Awareness**: Provide sufficient context in your prompts. This helps the AI understand the background and deliver responses that are coherent and contextually appropriate.
2. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop where you review the AI's output and adjust your prompts accordingly. This continuous feedback mechanism enhances the learning process and improves the quality of interactions over time.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different prompt structures and phrasings. Prompt engineering involves crafting prompts in a way that maximizes the AI's ability to generate useful and relevant responses.
4. **Leverage AI's Strengths**: Understand the strengths of the AI model you are using. For instance, GPT-3 excels in generating human-like text, so leverage this capability for tasks that require natural language generation.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Be mindful of ethical considerations when crafting prompts. Ensure that your interactions with AI are responsible and do not promote harmful or biased content.

By incorporating these best practices, you can enhance your ability to craft effective AI prompt strategies and make the most out of your interactions with AI models like GPT-4o.

# Building Confidence with AI Tools

Confidence doesn’t come overnight. It’s built through experience and perseverance. Here’s how I found my footing:

* **Celebrate Small Wins**: Every successful interaction, no matter how minor, is a step forward. 🎉 Recognizing these small victories is crucial because they serve as building blocks for greater achievements. Each time you successfully navigate an AI tool, you gain a little more confidence in your ability to handle more complex tasks. This positive reinforcement encourages continued learning and exploration, making the journey with AI tools more enjoyable and less daunting.
* **Reflect on Progress:** Take time to look back and see how far you’ve come. It’s easy to forget the strides you’ve made. Regular reflection allows you to appreciate your growth and understand the areas where you’ve improved. By acknowledging your progress, you can identify patterns in your learning process, which can help you tackle future challenges more effectively. This reflection not only boosts your confidence but also provides motivation to keep pushing forward.
* **Embrace Imperfection:** Just like a stone sculpture, AI interactions aren’t always perfect. And that’s okay. Understanding that mistakes are part of the learning process is essential. Each error is an opportunity to learn and improve. By accepting imperfections, you reduce the fear of failure, which can often be a barrier to trying new things. This mindset encourages experimentation and innovation, allowing you to discover new ways to leverage AI tools effectively. Embracing imperfection fosters a growth mindset, where challenges are seen as opportunities rather than obstacles.

# 

# Overcoming the Intimidation Factor

AI can feel intimidating, much like standing before a massive block of marble. But remember, it’s not about perfection; it’s about progress. Here’s how to shift your mindset:

* **View AI as a Partner:** It’s not here to replace you but to collaborate with you. Together, you can achieve more. Embracing AI as a partner means recognizing its potential to enhance your capabilities. For instance, in programs like ChatGPT, AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, providing insights that would take humans much longer to uncover. By working alongside AI, you can focus on strategic decision-making and creative problem-solving, leveraging AI's strengths to complement your own.
* **Focus on Your “Why”** Understand what you hope to accomplish with AI. This clarity will guide your journey.✨ Knowing your purpose for integrating AI into your work is crucial. Whether it's improving efficiency, enhancing customer experiences, or driving innovation, having a clear goal will help you navigate the complexities of AI adoption. Programs such as **AI in customer service** can automate routine inquiries, allowing you to concentrate on more complex customer interactions, ultimately improving satisfaction and loyalty.
* **Stay Patient**: Mastery takes time. Be kind to yourself as you learn and grow. Learning to work with AI is a journey, not a sprint. It's important to allow yourself the time to understand and adapt to new technologies. **AI training workshops** and **online courses** can provide structured learning paths, helping you build your skills gradually. Remember, every expert was once a beginner, and patience is key to mastering any new tool or technology.

# 

# A New Perspective: AI as a Creative Collaborator

* **Brainstorm Together**: Use AI to generate ideas and explore new possibilities. When you sit down to brainstorm, AI can be an invaluable partner. Imagine having access to a vast repository of knowledge and creativity at your fingertips. AI can suggest ideas you might not have considered, helping you break free from creative blocks. By inputting a few keywords or concepts, AI can generate a list of potential directions, themes, or even entire concepts for your project. This collaborative brainstorming can lead to innovative solutions and fresh perspectives that might not emerge in a traditional brainstorming session.
* **Draft and Refine**: Let AI help you draft outlines and refine messy paragraphs. Writing can be a daunting task, especially when you're staring at a blank page. AI can assist in drafting initial outlines, providing a structured framework to build upon. Once you have a draft, AI can help refine your work by suggesting improvements, rephrasing awkward sentences, and ensuring clarity and coherence. This iterative process allows you to focus on the creative aspects of writing while AI handles the technicalities, resulting in a polished and professional final product.
* **Embrace the Process**: Enjoy the journey of discovery and creativity. Working with AI is not just about the end result; it's about embracing the creative process. AI encourages experimentation and exploration, allowing you to take risks and try new approaches without fear of failure. This collaborative journey can lead to unexpected discoveries and a deeper understanding of your creative potential. By viewing AI as a partner rather than a tool

As I reflect on my journey, the key is embracing the process. It’s about staying curious, being patient, and allowing yourself to grow. So, next time you think, “I don’t think I’ll ever truly ‘get it,’” remember this: you’re already closer than you think. In the end, it’s not about mastering AI overnight. It’s about making it work for you, just like I transitioned from stone to digital. So take a deep breath, dive in, and let the journey unfold.

# ""It feels like the digital landscape is evolving faster than I can keep up""

This additional quote reflects a similar sentiment about the challenges of adapting to the rapidly changing digital world.

If you’ve ever had this thought, I want you to know you’re not alone. That doubt, that nagging feeling that you’re somehow behind the curve, is something everyone experiences when faced with change.

**But here’s the truth:** You don’t have to be an AI expert to succeed. You just need to start. 🔍

With resources like free training on AI tutorials for non-experts and beginner-friendly platforms, there’s *no reason* *to feel left out.*

AI isn’t here to replace your creativity, your intuition, or your ability to connect with others. It’s here to amplify those qualities and give you back the time to focus on what you’re best at.

**Action Steps:**

* Take advantage of the 7-Day AI Challenge to build foundational skills.
* Celebrate small wins, like automating one task or mastering one tool.
* Remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal.

This journey into the AI era isn’t about becoming someone you’re not - it’s about enhancing who you already are. Whether you’re a craftsman transitioning to digital tools or a network marketer exploring new strategies, AI is here to support, not intimidate.

"Brutes Guide: Their attacks, Tips and Information about them.",LEGOfortnite,1hswvre,2025-01-03 15:59:29,82,0.97,28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hswvre,maxignacio89,:od::od2:TUTORIAL,"1:Know your enemy:
Once you encounter Brutes,beware,they can instantly eliminate you in the early-game,that point when you aren't equipped with better charms yet and your hearts aren't enough to activate the one-shot protection if you are hit with any of the following attacks:

Acid Spit: When the Brutes find you out of their reach, they will try to spit Acid on you, whether the Acid attack hits their target or not, an Acid AoE will remain for 10 seconds,damaging every creature,ally or enemy except other Brutes.
You can avoid these attacks by running in one direction and then returning to make the Brutes fail their shot,if its almost late, you can always dodge to avoid the hit damage.
(The Brute can spit 1,2 or 3 Acid attacks depending on their health, if they are full/almost full they will throw 1 Acid attack,if they are about the half of their health they will throw 2 Acid attacks, and if they are below the half of their health they will throw 3 Acid attacks)

Smashing Race: After throwing their Acid Attacks,
Brutes may want to get close, that's when they charge forward to you and destroys everything in their path.
You can avoid this attack dodging, using grapplers to reach high ground or shooting at the ground with flint-knocks and using the glider to get away.
(can be used to farm resources)

Ground-shaking Smash: when you are at mid-range,Brute will raise both arms to hit the ground and cause devastating damage.
You can avoid this attack dodging or shooting at the brute with a flint-knock to get away from his attack range and dealing damage at the same time.
(can be used to farm resources)

Arm Sweep:if you are close enough, Brutes will attack sweeping with their arms to eliminate you.
(with enough experience and without lag, you can take down a Brute with only melee weapons and dodging every attack)
The Brute can try to attack like this a couple of times before using their next attack.

Ground Stomping: Brutes will raise a foot to stomp the ground,this attack damages everything (except other brutes) around the Brute.
You can avoid this attack by getting away of the Brute quick or you can dodge in the exact moment when the Brute's stomps the ground to avoid any damage.

2: There are 3 variants, the Brutes found in the Grasslands biome, the Sand Brutes found in the Dry Valley biome, and the Frost Brutes found in the Frostlands biome, each Brute variant can also have a Storm-Wild variant depending on your game mode or game settings (the Storm-Wild always appear in Expert mode, and can appear in Survival/Cozy/Sandbox mode if you enable the ""Storm-Wild enemies"" setting"")

These Storm-Wild Brutes variant are quest requirements for the Expert Trophies, you have to defeat them before you interact with a Village Square at Level 10 of each biome (Except Lost Isles region,which requires you to defeat a Storm-Wild Golem,but that's a different theme for another post)

3:Before your hunt, i recommend you to go to Audio settings and enable ""Visualize Sound Effects"" setting, by doing that you'll be able to detect brutes easily.

whether you are searching brutes for the Expert trophies or you need their scales for the Gem Cutter recipe,is recommended to search on the Star Wars Island, Brutes spawn rate there is higher due to the small size of the Island, and is the same island in all worlds with only slight changes like the bus station location or the Frostlands Lake (Which seems to be more in the west or east depending on the seed)

4:I marked certain areas (AKA hot spots) where Brutes are more used to spawn in the Island according to knowledge and feedback from u/OrionTrial and u/Tukaro.

The best advice if you only need to farm brute scales is to search alongside the shores of the Star Wars Island or the Main Island.

4.5 (as a side note, when you take the bus station to the Star Wars Island you may find a brute immediately, Bus stations often spawn far away from the Rebel Outpost in shores where Brutes spawn,be careful)

5: ""Secret"" Spawns:
Brutes can spawn in Beast's den, those grottos that requires certain resources to be opened (Brute Scales/Rift Shards,etc).
Initially,when you open these grottos a Golem will spawn, but after defeating him a Brute will spawn there each time you log again into the world.

(The real Secret spawn are the Main Island caves, which are still discovered by new and old players, and its surprising because is a normal cave on the outside,but once you enter you find a wide cave with scarce resources and a Brute waiting for you, after defeating him the Brute should respawn after certain time or after each login, being an useful Scale-Farming method) (I couldn't find any to show images,and my world where i had one was lost long time ago)

6:Brutes Loot:

Grasslands Brutes will drop one Brute Scale.

Dry Valley Brutes will drop a normal Brute Scale and a Sand Brute Scale.

Frostlands Brutes will drop a normal Brute Scale and a Frost Brute Scale.

Besides their scales, Brutes will drop 75 essence, 5 to 10 stink glands and 30 Storm Cores if it was a Storm-Wild variant.

i recommend using crossbows, flint-knocks, or muskets, in that order of relevance.
You can use a lot of dynamite or thermal detonators as well, the explosions stuns the brutes



TL:DR: Gem Cutter requires 3 Brute Scales,but Brutes are scary,Craft charms to get more health and protection,craft crossbows or flint-knocks to attack from long distance,learn to dodge and hunt them down.

TL:DR 2.0: ""i need Storm-Wild brutes to achieve the trophies"" search in the Star Wars Island flying with an airship with ""Visualize Sound Effects"" until you find one.

hope you find this guide helpful :D"
Thinking of upgrading to loose substrate for my girl. Help please! ,BeardedDragons,1hsttpw,2025-01-03 13:51:01,26,1.0,37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hsttpw,BoogerKiwi-70,Help,"Hello everyone! 
I’ve had my lovely Barbara Jean (pictured here) for about 6 months now. She was surrendered to me, so I’m not entirely sure if her age, but she’s definitely a young adult (between 1.5 and 2.5 years). 

I upgraded her enclosure maybe 4 months ago, it is 4x2x2 and has a tiled floor and the warm side has a “sandbox” base for her to experience loose substrate (see photos). I used Exo Terra Stone Desert Substrate for this portion of the enclosure. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking of expanding the loose substrate to the entirety of the tank. I feel like there a lot of “dead space” in the center of the enclosure, and if I put loose substrate then I could arrange some wood and rocks for her to have extra climbing material. Even though she doesn’t use her sand box a ton, I just feel like loose substrate must be more appealing to her than plain cold tile? Maybe I’m projecting, though 😅

Anyway, my questions are: 

1. Is this worth doing, or will the change in environment just stress her out? Do you think she needs more climbing accessories in the middle area? What would you suggest?

 2. If I decide to expand the loose substrate, should I just use more of the Exo Terra Stone Desert? Or should I go with half play sand and half topsoil? If I do the mix, can anyone recommend specific types/brands that are available in Ontario, Canada (Canadian Tire, Walmart, Rona, Home Depot are all options here). I’m SUPER anxious about choosing a topsoil and there being something in it that can hurt her. 

Thanks a MILLION! This group has been a lifesaver for a new(ish) anxious beardie mom and I appreciate y’all so much!

"My life, abridged",depression,1hre0hh,2025-01-01 17:12:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1hre0hh/my_life_abridged/,Agitated-Leading9231,,"Another new year, and yet, I know deep down inside, this year won't be any better than the last. 

I'm 38, and I have yet to have a good year, or even a good month, in my entire life. Matter of fact, 2025 is starting off to show me that this year, things may turn worse than ever. 

I try to find the strength and the will every day to carry on, to mask my pain so that I can be strong for those around me, but it's becoming harder by the day for me to even do that. 

We can start from the beginning, abridged version of course, because to write everything would take me forever, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have the patience to read it.

My childhood was stolen from me. My father's first attempt on my life that I remember (because of the traumatic acts that happened) was when I was 3. He locked my mother and I in a trailer and lit it on fire. We got out, my mom got me in her car,  front passenger seat and we started to back out as a steel tool chest snagged the window over my face from my father throwing it. That was the first real memory of my father. 

After my mom went back to him a few months later, things didn't get any better. For the next 13 years, my father locked me in my room, I was not allowed to cross the bedroom threshold. I was given a ketchup bottle full of water everyday, and that was to last me until bed time. If I needed to go to the bathroom, I had to wait for my father to pass by my room and get his permission. I wasnt allowed toys, or to talk to my mother, talk to myself, make ""sound effects"". I was allowed books, paper and pencils. 

My father, who claimed disability by the time I was 6, spent his days trying to catch me breaking one of these rules. He would sneak down the hall, stand there and wait for extended periods. If he couldn't catch me doing something, he would come up with a reason to punish me. My punishments were typically severe beatings with foreign objects that would leave bruising, blood blisters, and in some cases, lacerations. I would be kept from school until I healed. 

When I wasn't in my room, my father would have me on our property in the middle of nowhere cutting fields on my hands and knees with scissors, pulling star thistle bare handed. He would make piles of rocks taller than me with his tractor, then give me 2 5 gallon buckets and then I would fill them to the top, because if I didn't, I was beaten. Them I would carry both buckets at the same time about an acre, make a new pile. I would move then from one side of the property to the other, all day, every day, weather did not matter, from dawn till dark. 

Other times, my punishment was to stand in the corner from about 8 am to 6pm, break was given at lunch and dinner. Or writing,  literally, 1 million times a phrase that he felt I needed. 

I got in a fight at school when I was about 8. It was right after Christmas. I begged the teacher not to send a letter home. I didn't want my dad to take my presents away and hit me. Needless to say, they still sent the letter. 

Not long after that, at 9 years old, I decided to run away from home. I lived in the middle of nowhere and figured I'd live like the Indians did. I made it a few miles, chasing a few deer and squirrels along the way thinking I could get them to eat, and then the police found me. They took me back to my parents. I was beaten senseless and stood in the corner for 10 hours a day. 

About this time a worker from child protective services showed up unannounced. My father rushed me to my room, kicked my foot prints out of the push carpet and an investigation was launched. 

My mother and father denied all wrong songs, saying I was a liar and a troubled child.

I was put on 3 years of probation, made to pick up cans along the roadways to pay a fine, I was put in scared straight where they locked me in the county jail and allowed inmates to yell and scream at me, threaten me etc.

Meal time, I was fed separate from my family, I sat at a bar with my back to the dinner table. My dad would feed his cat at food next to me. The cats fall would be in my plate, in my face, but I couldn't tell her no, I couldn't move her, or her overwhelming smelling at food, and I could ask anyone to move her for me. 

Bed time was at 5:30 pm.

I wasn't allowed to see my extended family such as aunts, grandparents etc. If they came over, which was really rare, I stayed in my room with strict instructions to not speak. If someone was to speak to me, I was to answer, but carefully, and not engage in extended conversation. If i displeased him with my interaction, he would give me a look and I knew when they left, what was in store for me. 

My mother left my father many times during my childhood, but each time went back just a few weeks or months later. One of the times when she left him, I picked up kickboxing unbeknownst to my father. 

When I was 13,she left him again. This time she stayed gone for over a year. During this time, I wanted to find a job in the small town I lived in. I wanted to save up for a car when I was 16. I was now just barely 14. I got on my bike and ride around town, hanging fliers and asking around. As I rode along the side of highway 99, a red pickup hit me in my chest, then drove halfway up my legs, threw it in reverse and backed over me. 

I stayed conscious the whole time, unsure of if I was gonna survive. Everything was broken in my left side except a few ribs, my back or my neck. My left foot had all the flesh and muscle torn off, 368 stitches, inside and out and the possibility of a skin graft to put it together. My right arm was snapped in half,  multiple broken bones on the right side, but not as bad as my left. I was bedridden for nearly 6 months, in a wheelchair for a year. I was told I would never play a ssport again, run again or even walk without a sever limp. But I proved them all wrong. 

Shortly after I was walking again, I got caught by my mother with a playboy magazine in my room. She wasn't happy. She called my father who lived a few miles away. The next morning while I slept, my mother had my father come over. He burst in my room, drug me out of bed, the me down, which really hurt from the injuries I was still recovering from. He then proceeded to throw me out of my mother's house telling me to never be seen again. I was just over 15. I or some clothes in my back pack, hugged my cat good bye and started walking down the dirt road. 

I didn't know where to go or what to do. I went to the elementary school, they were closed for some sort of break, and i sat on the tables outside, wondering. Then I saw a big red plastic turtle shaped sandbox, it's shell was the lid. It was getting late, dark would be here shortly, so I went to the sandbox, opened the lid, curled up in the sand, pulled the lid over me and fell asleep for the night. 

The next morning, I heard voices outside my sand box. They sounded familiar, like one of my friends and his sister. They were playing. I came out to go play with them. They were surprised, needless to say, to see me come out of nowhere. They asked, and I told them I was staying there, I had no home. They played for a while and then they left. 

Not long after that I saw them coming back, but they had an adult with them who I assumed was their mom. I ran to my box, closed the lid and hid. She came over and tried to convince me to come out. But I was afraid I was gonna be in trouble, so I stayed quite and didn't come out, she didn't open the lid, but instead left. A few more minutes later I heard a vehicle, some footsteps and then a man's voice telling me to get out of the title and come with him. I complied it off fear that my father had insulted in me. 

It was my friends dad. His mom had went and got him. They took me to their home which was 2 doors down from my mother's. I was terrified my father would see me nearby and punish me. But the man that took me in held a black belt, and assured me i was safe, and that they would take care of me.

About a year passed, I was 16 now, my mother had moved and went back to my father in the time I was gone. She also left him again. She got an apartment one town down. It wasn't long until she called me multiple times begging me to come home. I finally did, on the condition that she don't go back to him. 

I continued my training in kickboxing, wrestled on the highschool wrestling team, I played football my sophomore and junior year, I got into weightlifting. Things were going great. Then she went back, again. 

This time, as I was isolated in my room eating my meal on my floor, my dad came in, yelling at me, he swung his fork near my face, I bobbed my head out of the way. He said ""oh, you think your a tough guy now because you know Kung fu huh?""

I said ""No, I don't think I am. I know I am. "". His eyes turned to stone and I knew what was coming. I stood up,  now over an inch taller than my father. He tried to hit me,I blocked it, gave him a quick jab and a hard back round to the leg. The fight was done.

He went to his room, grabbed his pistol and came back. He told me I had an hour to get out of his house. 

I called my friend, who I had met at my dojo. He was around 25 at the time. He was part of the 101st airborne and part of the initial invasion force into Iraq. He was an amateur MMA fighter, who shortly, would go pro under Ken Shamrock. He showed up to get me 10 minutes later, which was impressive, since he lived 25 minutes away, minimum. His radio was loud, which I knew would anger my dad. I got in his car and he proceeded to spin donuts in my dad's yard, which was one of his pride and joys. I told my friend ""dude, my dad's gonna be pissed."". My friend laughed and said ""so what? What's he gonna do about it?"". And we were off. 

I stayed the night with my friend. He didn't have any food, a small apartment in a rough neighborhood.  He struggled to make ends meet. We at raw potatoes with Sriracha for most meals when I was around. It wasn't long and I felt like I was a burden. I made up a story and left.

I found a bridge along the river. It had some spots I could stay dry and protected from the wind, so that's where I stayed at night. 

I dropped out of high-school. I barely went to the dojo. I was dating my senseis daughter, and she noticed my absence in school and class. She brought it up to my sensei, who investigated and eventually discovered I was an homeless kid. 

He took me in, gave me care, treated me well, and that's where I stayed until I turned 18.

At 18 I got my first apartment. I met an older woman who was 30. We started hanging out together and became an item. Prior to my departure to the army, I found out she was pregnant. I was so happy to be a father, I saw it as a chance to break the cycle of bad father's. I wanted to be a good one. 

I headed off to boot camp, and about halfway thru, I got a letter from the woman who was carrying my child. She said she had a miscarriage. The baby was so sick, it's skin was transparent. It has blue eyes and blonde hair. 

I grieved the loss of my child thru bootcamp, AIT and airborne school. I got letters from my mother telling me that lady had taken my vehicle and went to Arizona. She was still married. That she had been taking all my money. 

I flew home for leave, and called her, gave her 48 hours to return my vehicle or I report it stolen. A few days later it was left in the parking lot. My vehicle was brand new when I left. But know it looked like a bullet hole in the front bumper, a dented fender, looked like something blew up on the interior of my cars roof.

A few days later I went to burger King, as I went to open the door, the woman walks past me, carrying a new baby girl swaddled in a blanket. My world froze and she kept walking. I sat down inside, not even hungry anymore. I tried to reach out to the district attorneys for help. No one would help me. I lost the child again. 

Fast forward a year, whole on leave I met a girl in my hometown. We became an item, and eventually when I head back, I hear she's pregnant. So I start planning on moving her to base.

She did not want to. And she did not like me being in the military. She told me ""you either come back now, or in taking your child and you will NEVER see him again.

This destroyed me. So I made the worst decision I ever made and went AWOL to be back home with her and to see my child into the world.

When the day came for my son to be born, I sat in the hospital room with her waiting. There was a knock,  we expected a doctor, but instead 2 police officers and a social worker came in. They took me into the hall, handcuffed me amd took me to the county jail while my son was being born. I sat in there for 3 weeks.

One morning I got word that I was to be released with orders to fly back to my unit the next morning. They let me go, and I saw my son for the first time.

The next morning came, and I couldn't leave my child. I stayed. I became a fugitive, constantly being hunted.

My mother would tell others about my situation amd it wasn't long before people were leveraging it for their own gains. I would be bullied by other residents and if I defended myself, they would report me. My grandmother found out I got a 250 dollar bonus from my job for Christmas. She called me and said I had 1 hour to give her the 250 or else she would turn me in. So I gave her my money.

For 7 years I hid, working under the table jobs, being black mailed. I starved, I went from 190 pounds to 130 pounds. 

I missed the birth of both my children, got arrested 3 times for being AWOL and still always came back to take care of my family, since my now wife did not work ever.

My mother at one point allowed my wife and kids to stay with her, but I was not allowed to because she had told her apartment manager about what I was going thru, so yet again, I was homeless in a tent.

Finally after 7 years, I found out someone was tracking me again. I knew I had about 24 hours. But I was done. I sat there and waited. When they came, I offered no resistance, I just went. I allowed myself to be transported from the west coast to Fort Riley, despite many chances to escape again. They put me in Fort Leavenworth for 2 months and let me go with an other than honorable discharge. While sitting in headquarters I learned that the way they located me was my grandmother had called and turned me in asking for a reward.

But now I was free.

I came home, and was immediately back in the abuse.

See, since the beginning of our relationship, my wife had been mentally and physically abusive to me, ""what are you gonna do about it? YOUR AWOL! I'll just have you arrested!"" Was her favorite line.

She would tell me daily how ugly I was, how worthless I was, how I could do no better than her and that she settled for me. I wasnt allowed to shave, brush my teeth or shower without her permission or else I was a cheater. Several times she would come down the hall screaming at me out of the blue and dig her fingernails into my flesh and tear it. But I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't get help from the police, for 7 years they would of just taken me, even if they didn't take me when I was clear, where I came from, they would laugh me off and not do anything.

This continued for 11 years, her constant abuse, me being the sole provider. And then one day she decided she wanted a job.

She got a job at home for special needs people. 2 weeks in, she came home one night wearing a sweater I'd never seen and smelling like a man's cologne. I asked and she said it was her lesbian friends.

I got suspicious and dug around and found out she had some guy that used to be our neighbor who was married and had a handicapped child come from one state over and fuck her.

But that wasn't all. She had had 3 other affairs in that time, one with her own cousin.

We fought for days, me telling her to leave my home, but she wouldn't.

One evening she grabbed my .45 and walks up to me and asks ""is it loaded?"". I said yes. She points it at me and says ""all I have to do is pull the trigger. When they come, I'll just tell them you were hitting me and I did this in self defense.""

Eventually she put my gun down. After a few more hours I drip to my knees crying, I wrap my arms around her waist and beg her to stop. She pushed me off and walked out the front door in the dark.

I walked on my back porch, collapsed crying and passed out drunk. I don't know how much time passed, but soon, my phone rings, but I don't even look at it. Over and over my phone rings for quite a while, finally I look thru my tears and the dizziness from a 24 pack of beer. The number seemed familiar, but couldn't place it. At that moment my kids who were really young come running out ""dad, there's a bunch of cops with spotlights out front telling you to come out."".

I stagger to my door and am hit with so many lights and an officer on a megaphone ""turn around, put your hands in the air and walk backward to the sound of my voice."". I have no idea what's going on,  and as I comply it's really hard to walk forwards so drunk, I was afraid I was gonna fall off my steps and someone would get jumpy and I would get all these cops unloading their guns into me and possibly hitting a child.

When I hit my circular drive I'm told to drop to my knees and place my hands on top of my head. I was cuffed and put into a squad car. I ask what I'm being arrested for, but all they would say is ""what do you think?"", my response was ""because I'm drunk?"" They said ""now is that a crime to drink in your home?"", to which I replied ""no, so what am I being arrested for?"". I was told to shut up and I'll find out when his partner gets back.

Shortly later another squad car shows up, my wife gets out with a cop and they walk into my house.

I told the cop that was standing over me she was not to be in there, she is kicked out for what he did, he told me that's not my choice.

As the officers come out, I notice they have 1 of my revolvers and 2 rifles. (I had many more) my wife had given those to them because they were my favorites but didn't give them any others because she hoped to keep them.

As I'm being transported to the hospital to be cleared for jail, I'm finally told what I'm being arrested for. Assault and kidnapping. My heart stopped, I said no, I didn't do any of that! I'm then informed that it carry a mandatory 25 year sentence if convicted.

As we sit in the hospital, I'm a wreck, my heart was just ripped out, my family destroyed and now I'm facing serious charges and a 25 year sentence for something I didn't even remotely do.

I ask the officer if I could prove I'm telling the truth, if he would drop the charges. He says yes.

I pause knowing I've got one shot, if I can't prove it in my first attempt, that's it, I'm done. I say ""you have my phone, right?"" He says yes.

I say, go thru it, you will find everything there, she is lying she cheated, she did all these things. I just hugged her on my knees and asked her to stop. The cop gets my phone from his squad car leaving hospital security to watch me. He comes back in and confirms that I'm giving permission for him to go thru my phone,  I confirm and he starts.

Pretty soon ""did you call her this? How about this?"" To which I say ""yes, I absolutely did."" His response was ""I can't blame you. "". He then says ok, I'm gonna go make some calls and look into some facts. A while later he returns. He tells me my story matched 100 percent to my wife's sisters story and everything he could find.

He told me all charges were being dropped, but, because of the volatile situation and the fact I was so drunk, he didn't feel it was smart to let me go home that night, that I was going to be booked for the night in the jail and he would release me first thing in the morning.

I went back home and for nearly a month I was forced to live with her, she would not leave. Her family who lived nearby wouldn't get her. So finally I ask my mother to give her a place to stay. Just 3 months, a chance to get a job, some money and a place of her own, if she don't, then kick her out at that point.

For nearly 8 months she stayed with my mother who lived 20 minutes away. During that time, my mother dropped by 1 time to check on me, called 2 times. I sat with my pistol in my mouth trying to find the courage to pull the trigger, but couldn't.

During this time I had 2 of my 3 kids with me.my youngest was about 2 at the time, and my ex wife had taken him. One night around 3 am, I got a call from my mother, they were bringing my youngest to me, my ex was having sex next to him, drinking constantly and stealing prescriptions.

It wasn't too long before I got the truth, my disabled mother had been selling her pills, my mother was allowing these men into her home, and even serving them dinner. My mother had even, prior to this separation, had been taking her to male strip clubs.

So now I had 3 kids, no help, no money for daycare. The older 2 went to school, but the youngest didn't. So now I had to take him to a construction site with me daily. And it's hard being a dad changing diapers and keeping a child safe while building houses.

Jumping ahead about a year or so, iet a great woman. I loved her to death. Deeper than I've loved anyone to this day. But this girl was friends with all sorts, she herself was bi sexual, had been in straight relationships, lesbian relationships and was even the third in another. She went to Germany within our format month for 2 weeks, and came back with chlamydia.

For some reason, she was always afraid that her child's father and I would talk and he would tell me something about her.

I turned a blind eye, but 4 years later, after being engaged to her for a year and our wedding 3 months away, I found out she had been having sex with some woman she worked with.

I broke it off. But, she lingered, I found out what it was she was concerned i would find out, she had HPV and had not disclosed this. I wound up getting warts that I had to have removed and still battle with occasionally to this day.

Well, about this time, the pandemic hit, I was laid off within the first month. I owned the house my parents had started buying in the mid 90s. Mortage was 700 for my 2 acres with a creek, 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The new note holder asked where his money was and when I told him I'm laid off due to the lock down,  he told me that was unacceptable. I told him there were protections against this during the pandemic. 2 weeks later, I had court papers hung on my property letting me know we were going into foreclosure. 

During this period I met another woman. She and I started dating and she found out about my situation. She lived about 50 miles away and offered me and my children to live with her and rebuild our life together.

Now this one gave me lots of red flags, real quick with pet names, talking about marriage within the first month or so of our relationship, but due to my circumstances, I was limited on where to go to keep my kids together and safe. So we began the move. It was December, I was a houndsman with a pack of 4 hounds, I had 2 goats, 3 ducks and 20 chickens. While moving this distance, I would show back up to my property early in the morning and in the evening to tend my animals.

One day I show back up, and my kennels are open, my dogs are gone, my goats are gone and there's a note from the sheriff that they had seized my animals for abandonment. I contacted them and set up a meeting with the undersheriff. He and the animal control officer sat in the room, and the sheriff told me before starting the recording that him and this guy wore the same uniform and that he will side with him no matter what.

The animal control officer got a noise complaint about my guns, when they showed up and couldn't get in contact with me, they looked thru my windows and saw that the house was nearly empty, so he seized my animals, despite each dog having tags with 3 phone numbers to contact me. 

I proved they my security cameras that I did not abandon, that I was there 2 times per day to care for them.

The sheriff says he will give my dogs back, but it's 100 bucks per animal I need to pay the shelter.

That was 600 bucks to get my 4 dogs and 2 goats back, even though I was innocent, just weeks before Christmas. I could only afford my dogs, so they kept my goats and sold them to butcher.

So now we are in the new home with this woman, and I notice she has books about how to keep a man, how to make a man love you, she would talk manipulation tactics with my daughter. One day I came home early, and caught her screaming in the room at my daughter about me. I stood there and waited. She came down the hall and her expression changed ""oh hey baby"". We argued a bit and that was it.

It wasn't long after that I found out my 13 year old daughter had been talking to adult men online, getting inappropriate pictures, ditching school, smoking,drinking and lying about her whereabouts.

I took her computer away, grounded her and made her do push-ups for lying to me for about 5 minutes. I thought I handled it right.

About the time omnicron varient came out, I caught covid. I was laying in bed on a Sunday, feeling dead,when there's a knock and there's sheriff's at the door. I put on my mask and go to speak to them. They start asking about my 13 year old daughter and if they can speak to her. That they had gotten a concerning report.

So I get my daughter and I go back in. About 5 minutes later they tell me they are taking her to the hospital for evaluation because she made specific suicidal threats. They told me I should hear from the hospital soon.

Over 2 hours passed and no call, so I began calling. I would get hung up on, put on hold for an hour and just generally stonewalled for nearly 2 weeks. Now I have sole custody, legal and physical of all 3 kids. I told the hospital this and asked why they were withholding my daughter and information from me, why I couldn't see my daughter. They told me she was in protective custody and getting sent to an institution and hung up on me.

Pretty soon social workers show up. They tell me that grounding my child for 2 weeks to the house and property, taking away her computer and internet access and making her do push-ups is child abuse. 

I call my mother, because I found a letter in my daughters things from her where she had made plans to come get her one night while I was in ju jitsu and help her run away 200 miles to her new home. I ask my mother why she would do this to me amd my family. And in a cold unrecognizable tone, she said, ""because I'm angry with you for not letting me be around them.""

I won the court case, but now my daughter was back. She continued stealing, I was forced by social services to allow her to what she wanted when she wanted, like go to the teen center whenever she wanted for however long she wanted and I could not supervise, if I did not, it would be abuse and neglect because she said she suicidal. She would go there and 18 year old boys would have sex with her in cars, I found this out years later from her brother.

She kept telling my boys ""dad better get in line or I'll have him put in line"" ""if I don't get to go stay with my mom, I will make it my mission to destroy dad's life."" Social services showed up 3 more times to investigate new allegations that she and my mother would make.

In this time I also found out my current girlfriend of the time I had been enabling this, putting her in touch with grandma and her mother, encouraging her to do these things. I figured it was so I would be hurt and she could come in amd play super hero and win me over.

I later found out I was correct, she had described a manipulation technique that she read about called ""the white knight"" to my daughter and son, and she attempted to employ it on me.

So when I found this out, she wanted me out of the house immediately, I agreed to move ASAP, but she said no, not good enough, if I have to get an emergency order to get you out tomorrow, I will.

So the next night, when I come home from work, she starts screaming at me. She starts yelling about me having HPV, (I told her this before we did anything so she would be aware, make her decision amd we could work to be safe) in front of my children, which was wrong and gross. I asked her to stop, she didn't. My kids were now standing there watching her yell this and I attempted to cover her mouth, but before I even reached out she screamed bloody murder and tore the skin from my face nearly putting out my eye.

I just walked off, went to bed and said forget it. The next day she was gone. She didn't come back. But the cops did. I told them what happened. They said they came with every intention of arresting me, but after hearing my story and confirming it with the kids, they decided not to. They told me I had 24 hours to leave, if I did not, they would arrest me under some form of a felony.

So I packed what I could in the SUV, loaded up my kids and we slept in a parking lot for nearly a week. I left my hounds, but kept coming back in the night to feed and care for them.

I stayed with my boss at the time, he was an old guy. But he let me and the kids stay there. I was there about a month, but wasn't having luck getting into any form of housing. Where I came from, to even get a crappy apartment, you needed a 650 credit score.

I had around a 515 from robbing Peter to pay paul most my life trying to make ends meet. I couldn't continue imposing on this guy, and it was tough being in a tiny room with all my kids. So I started looking for a roommate situation where we could have normality and more space.

Some older woman was renting out a few rooms on her 20 acre property. I reached out amd met her, she agreed to allow us to live there and my hounds were welcome. So we went there.

Not even 2 weeks in, I notice my tools start disappearing, items in my room would be moved or gone. She was legitimate crazy. She would talk about waiting for me to come home and hitting me in the back of the head with a baseball bat to my kids. One day while I was at work, her and her daughter call me, they tell me to come bury my dog, they shot her because she wouldn't shut up. But then in the same breath, they threaten to shoot me as well when I come out.

Of course the police weren't interested in helping me. So I collected what I could of my belongings, grabbed my kids and left, I couldn't get an apartment with my animals, and by taking them, I chose them over my kids and was dooming them to be in this situation forever. I lost the rest of what i loved that day.

I found an old woman that managed some apartments, she liked me, and decided that even though my credit wasn't what she wanted, she would give me a home. We moved into our first home in a little over a year after becoming homeless.

Things went well, I started dating someone I had known for a year, I had a great job at a mill. But I needed hand surgery for an injury that I had had for nearly 4 years. When I was undergoing the operation, my oldest son decided without telling me, that he wanted to see if his mom had changed. He was 15. He reached out to her, told her where we lived and met up with her, after she had abandoned them all.

I allowed him to as he pleased with her, so long as he didn't leave town amd she didn't have my exact address. Their relationship went for nearly 8 months when I was served papers. Now she wanted in the baby's life, who was now 7 and didn't even know her.

 About this time though I had started the process of buying a home across the country. I wanted a new start and new life. I had worked hard to get my credit score to 690 and was ready.

So off I went. I thought it was gonna be great, I mean gas where I came from was 6 bucks a gallon, now I'm paying 2.38. I took a big pay cut, I went from 40 bucks an hour to 20 bucks here doing construction. But I was alright. Then I thought it was gonna get better. My new boss wanted to retire, he offered me his 20 year old company, I just needed 30k down. I started being taught to do estimates for him. I did 12. But was understood by illegal immigrants on everyone of them. In the meantime, work the company did have, he sub contracted out, went on vacation amd laid me off for a month just doing estimates.

Mortage fell behind, bills fell behind. I asked my girlfriend to help me for a few months, she wasn't too happy. She paid 1 month, and didn't after that.

Now I sit here dealing with the depression, the suicidal thoughts. My relationship is falling apart.

This is the abridged version of my life. I left out tons of stories, information amd other things.

I've never talked about this stuff to anyone, I carry it silently always hopeful. But I'm scared now. I've battled depression a long time, baddepression, but never this bad. In a few days it's been 2 months of feeling this.

I have no family or friends, and I don't want a therapist.

I guess this was my attempt to talk, and make myself feel a little more ok.

If you've read this far thank you for hearing me.

But please, if you feel compelled to comment or message me, don't attack me. I'm not proud of what I did leaving the army. I'm not proud to have an STI. It's all dishonorable and disgusting, I know. But it's part of my story, amd for once, I wanted to tell even those parts.

"My life, abridged",story,1hrdzdf,2025-01-01 17:11:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1hrdzdf/my_life_abridged/,Agitated-Leading9231,My Life Story,"Another new year, and yet, I know deep down inside, this year won't be any better than the last. 

I'm 38, and I have yet to have a good year, or even a good month, in my entire life. Matter of fact, 2025 is starting off to show me that this year, things may turn worse than ever. 

I try to find the strength and the will every day to carry on, to mask my pain so that I can be strong for those around me, but it's becoming harder by the day for me to even do that. 

We can start from the beginning, abridged version of course, because to write everything would take me forever, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have the patience to read it.

My childhood was stolen from me. My father's first attempt on my life that I remember (because of the traumatic acts that happened) was when I was 3. He locked my mother and I in a trailer and lit it on fire. We got out, my mom got me in her car,  front passenger seat and we started to back out as a steel tool chest snagged the window over my face from my father throwing it. That was the first real memory of my father. 

After my mom went back to him a few months later, things didn't get any better. For the next 13 years, my father locked me in my room, I was not allowed to cross the bedroom threshold. I was given a ketchup bottle full of water everyday, and that was to last me until bed time. If I needed to go to the bathroom, I had to wait for my father to pass by my room and get his permission. I wasnt allowed toys, or to talk to my mother, talk to myself, make ""sound effects"". I was allowed books, paper and pencils. 

My father, who claimed disability by the time I was 6, spent his days trying to catch me breaking one of these rules. He would sneak down the hall, stand there and wait for extended periods. If he couldn't catch me doing something, he would come up with a reason to punish me. My punishments were typically severe beatings with foreign objects that would leave bruising, blood blisters, and in some cases, lacerations. I would be kept from school until I healed. 

When I wasn't in my room, my father would have me on our property in the middle of nowhere cutting fields on my hands and knees with scissors, pulling star thistle bare handed. He would make piles of rocks taller than me with his tractor, then give me 2 5 gallon buckets and then I would fill them to the top, because if I didn't, I was beaten. Them I would carry both buckets at the same time about an acre, make a new pile. I would move then from one side of the property to the other, all day, every day, weather did not matter, from dawn till dark. 

Other times, my punishment was to stand in the corner from about 8 am to 6pm, break was given at lunch and dinner. Or writing,  literally, 1 million times a phrase that he felt I needed. 

I got in a fight at school when I was about 8. It was right after Christmas. I begged the teacher not to send a letter home. I didn't want my dad to take my presents away and hit me. Needless to say, they still sent the letter. 

Not long after that, at 9 years old, I decided to run away from home. I lived in the middle of nowhere and figured I'd live like the Indians did. I made it a few miles, chasing a few deer and squirrels along the way thinking I could get them to eat, and then the police found me. They took me back to my parents. I was beaten senseless and stood in the corner for 10 hours a day. 

About this time a worker from child protective services showed up unannounced. My father rushed me to my room, kicked my foot prints out of the push carpet and an investigation was launched. 

My mother and father denied all wrong songs, saying I was a liar and a troubled child.

I was put on 3 years of probation, made to pick up cans along the roadways to pay a fine, I was put in scared straight where they locked me in the county jail and allowed inmates to yell and scream at me, threaten me etc.

Meal time, I was fed separate from my family, I sat at a bar with my back to the dinner table. My dad would feed his cat at food next to me. The cats fall would be in my plate, in my face, but I couldn't tell her no, I couldn't move her, or her overwhelming smelling at food, and I could ask anyone to move her for me. 

Bed time was at 5:30 pm.

I wasn't allowed to see my extended family such as aunts, grandparents etc. If they came over, which was really rare, I stayed in my room with strict instructions to not speak. If someone was to speak to me, I was to answer, but carefully, and not engage in extended conversation. If i displeased him with my interaction, he would give me a look and I knew when they left, what was in store for me. 

My mother left my father many times during my childhood, but each time went back just a few weeks or months later. One of the times when she left him, I picked up kickboxing unbeknownst to my father. 

When I was 13,she left him again. This time she stayed gone for over a year. During this time, I wanted to find a job in the small town I lived in. I wanted to save up for a car when I was 16. I was now just barely 14. I got on my bike and ride around town, hanging fliers and asking around. As I rode along the side of highway 99, a red pickup hit me in my chest, then drove halfway up my legs, threw it in reverse and backed over me. 

I stayed conscious the whole time, unsure of if I was gonna survive. Everything was broken in my left side except a few ribs, my back or my neck. My left foot had all the flesh and muscle torn off, 368 stitches, inside and out and the possibility of a skin graft to put it together. My right arm was snapped in half,  multiple broken bones on the right side, but not as bad as my left. I was bedridden for nearly 6 months, in a wheelchair for a year. I was told I would never play a ssport again, run again or even walk without a sever limp. But I proved them all wrong. 

Shortly after I was walking again, I got caught by my mother with a playboy magazine in my room. She wasn't happy. She called my father who lived a few miles away. The next morning while I slept, my mother had my father come over. He burst in my room, drug me out of bed, the me down, which really hurt from the injuries I was still recovering from. He then proceeded to throw me out of my mother's house telling me to never be seen again. I was just over 15. I or some clothes in my back pack, hugged my cat good bye and started walking down the dirt road. 

I didn't know where to go or what to do. I went to the elementary school, they were closed for some sort of break, and i sat on the tables outside, wondering. Then I saw a big red plastic turtle shaped sandbox, it's shell was the lid. It was getting late, dark would be here shortly, so I went to the sandbox, opened the lid, curled up in the sand, pulled the lid over me and fell asleep for the night. 

The next morning, I heard voices outside my sand box. They sounded familiar, like one of my friends and his sister. They were playing. I came out to go play with them. They were surprised, needless to say, to see me come out of nowhere. They asked, and I told them I was staying there, I had no home. They played for a while and then they left. 

Not long after that I saw them coming back, but they had an adult with them who I assumed was their mom. I ran to my box, closed the lid and hid. She came over and tried to convince me to come out. But I was afraid I was gonna be in trouble, so I stayed quite and didn't come out, she didn't open the lid, but instead left. A few more minutes later I heard a vehicle, some footsteps and then a man's voice telling me to get out of the title and come with him. I complied it off fear that my father had insulted in me. 

It was my friends dad. His mom had went and got him. They took me to their home which was 2 doors down from my mother's. I was terrified my father would see me nearby and punish me. But the man that took me in held a black belt, and assured me i was safe, and that they would take care of me.

About a year passed, I was 16 now, my mother had moved and went back to my father in the time I was gone. She also left him again. She got an apartment one town down. It wasn't long until she called me multiple times begging me to come home. I finally did, on the condition that she don't go back to him. 

I continued my training in kickboxing, wrestled on the highschool wrestling team, I played football my sophomore and junior year, I got into weightlifting. Things were going great. Then she went back, again. 

This time, as I was isolated in my room eating my meal on my floor, my dad came in, yelling at me, he swung his fork near my face, I bobbed my head out of the way. He said ""oh, you think your a tough guy now because you know Kung fu huh?""

I said ""No, I don't think I am. I know I am. "". His eyes turned to stone and I knew what was coming. I stood up,  now over an inch taller than my father. He tried to hit me,I blocked it, gave him a quick jab and a hard back round to the leg. The fight was done.

He went to his room, grabbed his pistol and came back. He told me I had an hour to get out of his house. 

I called my friend, who I had met at my dojo. He was around 25 at the time. He was part of the 101st airborne and part of the initial invasion force into Iraq. He was an amateur MMA fighter, who shortly, would go pro under Ken Shamrock. He showed up to get me 10 minutes later, which was impressive, since he lived 25 minutes away, minimum. His radio was loud, which I knew would anger my dad. I got in his car and he proceeded to spin donuts in my dad's yard, which was one of his pride and joys. I told my friend ""dude, my dad's gonna be pissed."". My friend laughed and said ""so what? What's he gonna do about it?"". And we were off. 

I stayed the night with my friend. He didn't have any food, a small apartment in a rough neighborhood.  He struggled to make ends meet. We at raw potatoes with Sriracha for most meals when I was around. It wasn't long and I felt like I was a burden. I made up a story and left.

I found a bridge along the river. It had some spots I could stay dry and protected from the wind, so that's where I stayed at night. 

I dropped out of high-school. I barely went to the dojo. I was dating my senseis daughter, and she noticed my absence in school and class. She brought it up to my sensei, who investigated and eventually discovered I was an homeless kid. 

He took me in, gave me care, treated me well, and that's where I stayed until I turned 18.

At 18 I got my first apartment. I met an older woman who was 30. We started hanging out together and became an item. Prior to my departure to the army, I found out she was pregnant. I was so happy to be a father, I saw it as a chance to break the cycle of bad father's. I wanted to be a good one. 

I headed off to boot camp, and about halfway thru, I got a letter from the woman who was carrying my child. She said she had a miscarriage. The baby was so sick, it's skin was transparent. It has blue eyes and blonde hair. 

I grieved the loss of my child thru bootcamp, AIT and airborne school. I got letters from my mother telling me that lady had taken my vehicle and went to Arizona. She was still married. That she had been taking all my money. 

I flew home for leave, and called her, gave her 48 hours to return my vehicle or I report it stolen. A few days later it was left in the parking lot. My vehicle was brand new when I left. But know it looked like a bullet hole in the front bumper, a dented fender, looked like something blew up on the interior of my cars roof.

A few days later I went to burger King, as I went to open the door, the woman walks past me, carrying a new baby girl swaddled in a blanket. My world froze and she kept walking. I sat down inside, not even hungry anymore. I tried to reach out to the district attorneys for help. No one would help me. I lost the child again. 

Fast forward a year, whole on leave I met a girl in my hometown. We became an item, and eventually when I head back, I hear she's pregnant. So I start planning on moving her to base.

She did not want to. And she did not like me being in the military. She told me ""you either come back now, or in taking your child and you will NEVER see him again.

This destroyed me. So I made the worst decision I ever made and went AWOL to be back home with her and to see my child into the world.

When the day came for my son to be born, I sat in the hospital room with her waiting. There was a knock,  we expected a doctor, but instead 2 police officers and a social worker came in. They took me into the hall, handcuffed me amd took me to the county jail while my son was being born. I sat in there for 3 weeks.

One morning I got word that I was to be released with orders to fly back to my unit the next morning. They let me go, and I saw my son for the first time.

The next morning came, and I couldn't leave my child. I stayed. I became a fugitive, constantly being hunted.

My mother would tell others about my situation amd it wasn't long before people were leveraging it for their own gains. I would be bullied by other residents and if I defended myself, they would report me. My grandmother found out I got a 250 dollar bonus from my job for Christmas. She called me and said I had 1 hour to give her the 250 or else she would turn me in. So I gave her my money.

For 7 years I hid, working under the table jobs, being black mailed. I starved, I went from 190 pounds to 130 pounds. 

I missed the birth of both my children, got arrested 3 times for being AWOL and still always came back to take care of my family, since my now wife did not work ever.

My mother at one point allowed my wife and kids to stay with her, but I was not allowed to because she had told her apartment manager about what I was going thru, so yet again, I was homeless in a tent.

Finally after 7 years, I found out someone was tracking me again. I knew I had about 24 hours. But I was done. I sat there and waited. When they came, I offered no resistance, I just went. I allowed myself to be transported from the west coast to Fort Riley, despite many chances to escape again. They put me in Fort Leavenworth for 2 months and let me go with an other than honorable discharge. While sitting in headquarters I learned that the way they located me was my grandmother had called and turned me in asking for a reward.

But now I was free.

I came home, and was immediately back in the abuse.

See, since the beginning of our relationship, my wife had been mentally and physically abusive to me, ""what are you gonna do about it? YOUR AWOL! I'll just have you arrested!"" Was her favorite line.

She would tell me daily how ugly I was, how worthless I was, how I could do no better than her and that she settled for me. I wasnt allowed to shave, brush my teeth or shower without her permission or else I was a cheater. Several times she would come down the hall screaming at me out of the blue and dig her fingernails into my flesh and tear it. But I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't get help from the police, for 7 years they would of just taken me, even if they didn't take me when I was clear, where I came from, they would laugh me off and not do anything.

This continued for 11 years, her constant abuse, me being the sole provider. And then one day she decided she wanted a job.

She got a job at home for special needs people. 2 weeks in, she came home one night wearing a sweater I'd never seen and smelling like a man's cologne. I asked and she said it was her lesbian friends.

I got suspicious and dug around and found out she had some guy that used to be our neighbor who was married and had a handicapped child come from one state over and fuck her.

But that wasn't all. She had had 3 other affairs in that time, one with her own cousin.

We fought for days, me telling her to leave my home, but she wouldn't.

One evening she grabbed my .45 and walks up to me and asks ""is it loaded?"". I said yes. She points it at me and says ""all I have to do is pull the trigger. When they come, I'll just tell them you were hitting me and I did this in self defense.""

Eventually she put my gun down. After a few more hours I drip to my knees crying, I wrap my arms around her waist and beg her to stop. She pushed me off and walked out the front door in the dark.

I walked on my back porch, collapsed crying and passed out drunk. I don't know how much time passed, but soon, my phone rings, but I don't even look at it. Over and over my phone rings for quite a while, finally I look thru my tears and the dizziness from a 24 pack of beer. The number seemed familiar, but couldn't place it. At that moment my kids who were really young come running out ""dad, there's a bunch of cops with spotlights out front telling you to come out."".

I stagger to my door and am hit with so many lights and an officer on a megaphone ""turn around, put your hands in the air and walk backward to the sound of my voice."". I have no idea what's going on,  and as I comply it's really hard to walk forwards so drunk, I was afraid I was gonna fall off my steps and someone would get jumpy and I would get all these cops unloading their guns into me and possibly hitting a child.

When I hit my circular drive I'm told to drop to my knees and place my hands on top of my head. I was cuffed and put into a squad car. I ask what I'm being arrested for, but all they would say is ""what do you think?"", my response was ""because I'm drunk?"" They said ""now is that a crime to drink in your home?"", to which I replied ""no, so what am I being arrested for?"". I was told to shut up and I'll find out when his partner gets back.

Shortly later another squad car shows up, my wife gets out with a cop and they walk into my house.

I told the cop that was standing over me she was not to be in there, she is kicked out for what he did, he told me that's not my choice.

As the officers come out, I notice they have 1 of my revolvers and 2 rifles. (I had many more) my wife had given those to them because they were my favorites but didn't give them any others because she hoped to keep them.

As I'm being transported to the hospital to be cleared for jail, I'm finally told what I'm being arrested for. Assault and kidnapping. My heart stopped, I said no, I didn't do any of that! I'm then informed that it carry a mandatory 25 year sentence if convicted.

As we sit in the hospital, I'm a wreck, my heart was just ripped out, my family destroyed and now I'm facing serious charges and a 25 year sentence for something I didn't even remotely do.

I ask the officer if I could prove I'm telling the truth, if he would drop the charges. He says yes.

I pause knowing I've got one shot, if I can't prove it in my first attempt, that's it, I'm done. I say ""you have my phone, right?"" He says yes.

I say, go thru it, you will find everything there, she is lying she cheated, she did all these things. I just hugged her on my knees and asked her to stop. The cop gets my phone from his squad car leaving hospital security to watch me. He comes back in and confirms that I'm giving permission for him to go thru my phone,  I confirm and he starts.

Pretty soon ""did you call her this? How about this?"" To which I say ""yes, I absolutely did."" His response was ""I can't blame you. "". He then says ok, I'm gonna go make some calls and look into some facts. A while later he returns. He tells me my story matched 100 percent to my wife's sisters story and everything he could find.

He told me all charges were being dropped, but, because of the volatile situation and the fact I was so drunk, he didn't feel it was smart to let me go home that night, that I was going to be booked for the night in the jail and he would release me first thing in the morning.

I went back home and for nearly a month I was forced to live with her, she would not leave. Her family who lived nearby wouldn't get her. So finally I ask my mother to give her a place to stay. Just 3 months, a chance to get a job, some money and a place of her own, if she don't, then kick her out at that point.

For nearly 8 months she stayed with my mother who lived 20 minutes away. During that time, my mother dropped by 1 time to check on me, called 2 times. I sat with my pistol in my mouth trying to find the courage to pull the trigger, but couldn't.

During this time I had 2 of my 3 kids with me.my youngest was about 2 at the time, and my ex wife had taken him. One night around 3 am, I got a call from my mother, they were bringing my youngest to me, my ex was having sex next to him, drinking constantly and stealing prescriptions.

It wasn't too long before I got the truth, my disabled mother had been selling her pills, my mother was allowing these men into her home, and even serving them dinner. My mother had even, prior to this separation, had been taking her to male strip clubs.

So now I had 3 kids, no help, no money for daycare. The older 2 went to school, but the youngest didn't. So now I had to take him to a construction site with me daily. And it's hard being a dad changing diapers and keeping a child safe while building houses.

Jumping ahead about a year or so, iet a great woman. I loved her to death. Deeper than I've loved anyone to this day. But this girl was friends with all sorts, she herself was bi sexual, had been in straight relationships, lesbian relationships and was even the third in another. She went to Germany within our format month for 2 weeks, and came back with chlamydia.

For some reason, she was always afraid that her child's father and I would talk and he would tell me something about her.

I turned a blind eye, but 4 years later, after being engaged to her for a year and our wedding 3 months away, I found out she had been having sex with some woman she worked with.

I broke it off. But, she lingered, I found out what it was she was concerned i would find out, she had HPV and had not disclosed this. I wound up getting warts that I had to have removed and still battle with occasionally to this day.

Well, about this time, the pandemic hit, I was laid off within the first month. I owned the house my parents had started buying in the mid 90s. Mortage was 700 for my 2 acres with a creek, 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The new note holder asked where his money was and when I told him I'm laid off due to the lock down,  he told me that was unacceptable. I told him there were protections against this during the pandemic. 2 weeks later, I had court papers hung on my property letting me know we were going into foreclosure. 

During this period I met another woman. She and I started dating and she found out about my situation. She lived about 50 miles away and offered me and my children to live with her and rebuild our life together.

Now this one gave me lots of red flags, real quick with pet names, talking about marriage within the first month or so of our relationship, but due to my circumstances, I was limited on where to go to keep my kids together and safe. So we began the move. It was December, I was a houndsman with a pack of 4 hounds, I had 2 goats, 3 ducks and 20 chickens. While moving this distance, I would show back up to my property early in the morning and in the evening to tend my animals.

One day I show back up, and my kennels are open, my dogs are gone, my goats are gone and there's a note from the sheriff that they had seized my animals for abandonment. I contacted them and set up a meeting with the undersheriff. He and the animal control officer sat in the room, and the sheriff told me before starting the recording that him and this guy wore the same uniform and that he will side with him no matter what.

The animal control officer got a noise complaint about my guns, when they showed up and couldn't get in contact with me, they looked thru my windows and saw that the house was nearly empty, so he seized my animals, despite each dog having tags with 3 phone numbers to contact me. 

I proved they my security cameras that I did not abandon, that I was there 2 times per day to care for them.

The sheriff says he will give my dogs back, but it's 100 bucks per animal I need to pay the shelter.

That was 600 bucks to get my 4 dogs and 2 goats back, even though I was innocent, just weeks before Christmas. I could only afford my dogs, so they kept my goats and sold them to butcher.

So now we are in the new home with this woman, and I notice she has books about how to keep a man, how to make a man love you, she would talk manipulation tactics with my daughter. One day I came home early, and caught her screaming in the room at my daughter about me. I stood there and waited. She came down the hall and her expression changed ""oh hey baby"". We argued a bit and that was it.

It wasn't long after that I found out my 13 year old daughter had been talking to adult men online, getting inappropriate pictures, ditching school, smoking,drinking and lying about her whereabouts.

I took her computer away, grounded her and made her do push-ups for lying to me for about 5 minutes. I thought I handled it right.

About the time omnicron varient came out, I caught covid. I was laying in bed on a Sunday, feeling dead,when there's a knock and there's sheriff's at the door. I put on my mask and go to speak to them. They start asking about my 13 year old daughter and if they can speak to her. That they had gotten a concerning report.

So I get my daughter and I go back in. About 5 minutes later they tell me they are taking her to the hospital for evaluation because she made specific suicidal threats. They told me I should hear from the hospital soon.

Over 2 hours passed and no call, so I began calling. I would get hung up on, put on hold for an hour and just generally stonewalled for nearly 2 weeks. Now I have sole custody, legal and physical of all 3 kids. I told the hospital this and asked why they were withholding my daughter and information from me, why I couldn't see my daughter. They told me she was in protective custody and getting sent to an institution and hung up on me.

Pretty soon social workers show up. They tell me that grounding my child for 2 weeks to the house and property, taking away her computer and internet access and making her do push-ups is child abuse. 

I call my mother, because I found a letter in my daughters things from her where she had made plans to come get her one night while I was in ju jitsu and help her run away 200 miles to her new home. I ask my mother why she would do this to me amd my family. And in a cold unrecognizable tone, she said, ""because I'm angry with you for not letting me be around them.""

I won the court case, but now my daughter was back. She continued stealing, I was forced by social services to allow her to what she wanted when she wanted, like go to the teen center whenever she wanted for however long she wanted and I could not supervise, if I did not, it would be abuse and neglect because she said she suicidal. She would go there and 18 year old boys would have sex with her in cars, I found this out years later from her brother.

She kept telling my boys ""dad better get in line or I'll have him put in line"" ""if I don't get to go stay with my mom, I will make it my mission to destroy dad's life."" Social services showed up 3 more times to investigate new allegations that she and my mother would make.

In this time I also found out my current girlfriend of the time I had been enabling this, putting her in touch with grandma and her mother, encouraging her to do these things. I figured it was so I would be hurt and she could come in amd play super hero and win me over.

I later found out I was correct, she had described a manipulation technique that she read about called ""the white knight"" to my daughter and son, and she attempted to employ it on me.

So when I found this out, she wanted me out of the house immediately, I agreed to move ASAP, but she said no, not good enough, if I have to get an emergency order to get you out tomorrow, I will.

So the next night, when I come home from work, she starts screaming at me. She starts yelling about me having HPV, (I told her this before we did anything so she would be aware, make her decision amd we could work to be safe) in front of my children, which was wrong and gross. I asked her to stop, she didn't. My kids were now standing there watching her yell this and I attempted to cover her mouth, but before I even reached out she screamed bloody murder and tore the skin from my face nearly putting out my eye.

I just walked off, went to bed and said forget it. The next day she was gone. She didn't come back. But the cops did. I told them what happened. They said they came with every intention of arresting me, but after hearing my story and confirming it with the kids, they decided not to. They told me I had 24 hours to leave, if I did not, they would arrest me under some form of a felony.

So I packed what I could in the SUV, loaded up my kids and we slept in a parking lot for nearly a week. I left my hounds, but kept coming back in the night to feed and care for them.

I stayed with my boss at the time, he was an old guy. But he let me and the kids stay there. I was there about a month, but wasn't having luck getting into any form of housing. Where I came from, to even get a crappy apartment, you needed a 650 credit score.

I had around a 515 from robbing Peter to pay paul most my life trying to make ends meet. I couldn't continue imposing on this guy, and it was tough being in a tiny room with all my kids. So I started looking for a roommate situation where we could have normality and more space.

Some older woman was renting out a few rooms on her 20 acre property. I reached out amd met her, she agreed to allow us to live there and my hounds were welcome. So we went there.

Not even 2 weeks in, I notice my tools start disappearing, items in my room would be moved or gone. She was legitimate crazy. She would talk about waiting for me to come home and hitting me in the back of the head with a baseball bat to my kids. One day while I was at work, her and her daughter call me, they tell me to come bury my dog, they shot her because she wouldn't shut up. But then in the same breath, they threaten to shoot me as well when I come out.

Of course the police weren't interested in helping me. So I collected what I could of my belongings, grabbed my kids and left, I couldn't get an apartment with my animals, and by taking them, I chose them over my kids and was dooming them to be in this situation forever. I lost the rest of what i loved that day.

I found an old woman that managed some apartments, she liked me, and decided that even though my credit wasn't what she wanted, she would give me a home. We moved into our first home in a little over a year after becoming homeless.

Things went well, I started dating someone I had known for a year, I had a great job at a mill. But I needed hand surgery for an injury that I had had for nearly 4 years. When I was undergoing the operation, my oldest son decided without telling me, that he wanted to see if his mom had changed. He was 15. He reached out to her, told her where we lived and met up with her, after she had abandoned them all.

I allowed him to as he pleased with her, so long as he didn't leave town amd she didn't have my exact address. Their relationship went for nearly 8 months when I was served papers. Now she wanted in the baby's life, who was now 7 and didn't even know her.

 About this time though I had started the process of buying a home across the country. I wanted a new start and new life. I had worked hard to get my credit score to 690 and was ready.

So off I went. I thought it was gonna be great, I mean gas where I came from was 6 bucks a gallon, now I'm paying 2.38. I took a big pay cut, I went from 40 bucks an hour to 20 bucks here doing construction. But I was alright. Then I thought it was gonna get better. My new boss wanted to retire, he offered me his 20 year old company, I just needed 30k down. I started being taught to do estimates for him. I did 12. But was understood by illegal immigrants on everyone of them. In the meantime, work the company did have, he sub contracted out, went on vacation amd laid me off for a month just doing estimates.

Mortage fell behind, bills fell behind. I asked my girlfriend to help me for a few months, she wasn't too happy. She paid 1 month, and didn't after that.

Now I sit here dealing with the depression, the suicidal thoughts. My relationship is falling apart.

This is the abridged version of my life. I left out tons of stories, information amd other things.

I've never talked about this stuff to anyone, I carry it silently always hopeful. But I'm scared now. I've battled depression a long time, baddepression, but never this bad. In a few days it's been 2 months of feeling this.

I have no family or friends, and I don't want a therapist.

I guess this was my attempt to talk, and make myself feel a little more ok.

If you've read this far thank you for hearing me.

But please, if you feel compelled to comment or message me, don't attack me. I'm not proud of what I did leaving the army. I'm not proud to have an STI. It's all dishonorable and disgusting, I know. But it's part of my story, amd for once, I wanted to tell even those parts.

"My life, abridged",stories,1hrdy5o,2025-01-01 17:09:24,1,0.57,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hrdy5o/my_life_abridged/,Agitated-Leading9231,Non-Fiction,"Another new year, and yet, I know deep down inside, this year won't be any better than the last. 

I'm 38, and I have yet to have a good year, or even a good month, in my entire life. Matter of fact, 2025 is starting off to show me that this year, things may turn worse than ever. 

I try to find the strength and the will every day to carry on, to mask my pain so that I can be strong for those around me, but it's becoming harder by the day for me to even do that. 

We can start from the beginning, abridged version of course, because to write everything would take me forever, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have the patience to read it.

My childhood was stolen from me. My father's first attempt on my life that I remember (because of the traumatic acts that happened) was when I was 3. He locked my mother and I in a trailer and lit it on fire. We got out, my mom got me in her car,  front passenger seat and we started to back out as a steel tool chest snagged the window over my face from my father throwing it. That was the first real memory of my father. 

After my mom went back to him a few months later, things didn't get any better. For the next 13 years, my father locked me in my room, I was not allowed to cross the bedroom threshold. I was given a ketchup bottle full of water everyday, and that was to last me until bed time. If I needed to go to the bathroom, I had to wait for my father to pass by my room and get his permission. I wasnt allowed toys, or to talk to my mother, talk to myself, make ""sound effects"". I was allowed books, paper and pencils. 

My father, who claimed disability by the time I was 6, spent his days trying to catch me breaking one of these rules. He would sneak down the hall, stand there and wait for extended periods. If he couldn't catch me doing something, he would come up with a reason to punish me. My punishments were typically severe beatings with foreign objects that would leave bruising, blood blisters, and in some cases, lacerations. I would be kept from school until I healed. 

When I wasn't in my room, my father would have me on our property in the middle of nowhere cutting fields on my hands and knees with scissors, pulling star thistle bare handed. He would make piles of rocks taller than me with his tractor, then give me 2 5 gallon buckets and then I would fill them to the top, because if I didn't, I was beaten. Them I would carry both buckets at the same time about an acre, make a new pile. I would move then from one side of the property to the other, all day, every day, weather did not matter, from dawn till dark. 

Other times, my punishment was to stand in the corner from about 8 am to 6pm, break was given at lunch and dinner. Or writing,  literally, 1 million times a phrase that he felt I needed. 

I got in a fight at school when I was about 8. It was right after Christmas. I begged the teacher not to send a letter home. I didn't want my dad to take my presents away and hit me. Needless to say, they still sent the letter. 

Not long after that, at 9 years old, I decided to run away from home. I lived in the middle of nowhere and figured I'd live like the Indians did. I made it a few miles, chasing a few deer and squirrels along the way thinking I could get them to eat, and then the police found me. They took me back to my parents. I was beaten senseless and stood in the corner for 10 hours a day. 

About this time a worker from child protective services showed up unannounced. My father rushed me to my room, kicked my foot prints out of the push carpet and an investigation was launched. 

My mother and father denied all wrong songs, saying I was a liar and a troubled child.

I was put on 3 years of probation, made to pick up cans along the roadways to pay a fine, I was put in scared straight where they locked me in the county jail and allowed inmates to yell and scream at me, threaten me etc.

Meal time, I was fed separate from my family, I sat at a bar with my back to the dinner table. My dad would feed his cat at food next to me. The cats fall would be in my plate, in my face, but I couldn't tell her no, I couldn't move her, or her overwhelming smelling at food, and I could ask anyone to move her for me. 

Bed time was at 5:30 pm.

I wasn't allowed to see my extended family such as aunts, grandparents etc. If they came over, which was really rare, I stayed in my room with strict instructions to not speak. If someone was to speak to me, I was to answer, but carefully, and not engage in extended conversation. If i displeased him with my interaction, he would give me a look and I knew when they left, what was in store for me. 

My mother left my father many times during my childhood, but each time went back just a few weeks or months later. One of the times when she left him, I picked up kickboxing unbeknownst to my father. 

When I was 13,she left him again. This time she stayed gone for over a year. During this time, I wanted to find a job in the small town I lived in. I wanted to save up for a car when I was 16. I was now just barely 14. I got on my bike and ride around town, hanging fliers and asking around. As I rode along the side of highway 99, a red pickup hit me in my chest, then drove halfway up my legs, threw it in reverse and backed over me. 

I stayed conscious the whole time, unsure of if I was gonna survive. Everything was broken in my left side except a few ribs, my back or my neck. My left foot had all the flesh and muscle torn off, 368 stitches, inside and out and the possibility of a skin graft to put it together. My right arm was snapped in half,  multiple broken bones on the right side, but not as bad as my left. I was bedridden for nearly 6 months, in a wheelchair for a year. I was told I would never play a ssport again, run again or even walk without a sever limp. But I proved them all wrong. 

Shortly after I was walking again, I got caught by my mother with a playboy magazine in my room. She wasn't happy. She called my father who lived a few miles away. The next morning while I slept, my mother had my father come over. He burst in my room, drug me out of bed, the me down, which really hurt from the injuries I was still recovering from. He then proceeded to throw me out of my mother's house telling me to never be seen again. I was just over 15. I or some clothes in my back pack, hugged my cat good bye and started walking down the dirt road. 

I didn't know where to go or what to do. I went to the elementary school, they were closed for some sort of break, and i sat on the tables outside, wondering. Then I saw a big red plastic turtle shaped sandbox, it's shell was the lid. It was getting late, dark would be here shortly, so I went to the sandbox, opened the lid, curled up in the sand, pulled the lid over me and fell asleep for the night. 

The next morning, I heard voices outside my sand box. They sounded familiar, like one of my friends and his sister. They were playing. I came out to go play with them. They were surprised, needless to say, to see me come out of nowhere. They asked, and I told them I was staying there, I had no home. They played for a while and then they left. 

Not long after that I saw them coming back, but they had an adult with them who I assumed was their mom. I ran to my box, closed the lid and hid. She came over and tried to convince me to come out. But I was afraid I was gonna be in trouble, so I stayed quite and didn't come out, she didn't open the lid, but instead left. A few more minutes later I heard a vehicle, some footsteps and then a man's voice telling me to get out of the title and come with him. I complied it off fear that my father had insulted in me. 

It was my friends dad. His mom had went and got him. They took me to their home which was 2 doors down from my mother's. I was terrified my father would see me nearby and punish me. But the man that took me in held a black belt, and assured me i was safe, and that they would take care of me.

About a year passed, I was 16 now, my mother had moved and went back to my father in the time I was gone. She also left him again. She got an apartment one town down. It wasn't long until she called me multiple times begging me to come home. I finally did, on the condition that she don't go back to him. 

I continued my training in kickboxing, wrestled on the highschool wrestling team, I played football my sophomore and junior year, I got into weightlifting. Things were going great. Then she went back, again. 

This time, as I was isolated in my room eating my meal on my floor, my dad came in, yelling at me, he swung his fork near my face, I bobbed my head out of the way. He said ""oh, you think your a tough guy now because you know Kung fu huh?""

I said ""No, I don't think I am. I know I am. "". His eyes turned to stone and I knew what was coming. I stood up,  now over an inch taller than my father. He tried to hit me,I blocked it, gave him a quick jab and a hard back round to the leg. The fight was done.

He went to his room, grabbed his pistol and came back. He told me I had an hour to get out of his house. 

I called my friend, who I had met at my dojo. He was around 25 at the time. He was part of the 101st airborne and part of the initial invasion force into Iraq. He was an amateur MMA fighter, who shortly, would go pro under Ken Shamrock. He showed up to get me 10 minutes later, which was impressive, since he lived 25 minutes away, minimum. His radio was loud, which I knew would anger my dad. I got in his car and he proceeded to spin donuts in my dad's yard, which was one of his pride and joys. I told my friend ""dude, my dad's gonna be pissed."". My friend laughed and said ""so what? What's he gonna do about it?"". And we were off. 

I stayed the night with my friend. He didn't have any food, a small apartment in a rough neighborhood.  He struggled to make ends meet. We at raw potatoes with Sriracha for most meals when I was around. It wasn't long and I felt like I was a burden. I made up a story and left.

I found a bridge along the river. It had some spots I could stay dry and protected from the wind, so that's where I stayed at night. 

I dropped out of high-school. I barely went to the dojo. I was dating my senseis daughter, and she noticed my absence in school and class. She brought it up to my sensei, who investigated and eventually discovered I was an homeless kid. 

He took me in, gave me care, treated me well, and that's where I stayed until I turned 18.

At 18 I got my first apartment. I met an older woman who was 30. We started hanging out together and became an item. Prior to my departure to the army, I found out she was pregnant. I was so happy to be a father, I saw it as a chance to break the cycle of bad father's. I wanted to be a good one. 

I headed off to boot camp, and about halfway thru, I got a letter from the woman who was carrying my child. She said she had a miscarriage. The baby was so sick, it's skin was transparent. It has blue eyes and blonde hair. 

I grieved the loss of my child thru bootcamp, AIT and airborne school. I got letters from my mother telling me that lady had taken my vehicle and went to Arizona. She was still married. That she had been taking all my money. 

I flew home for leave, and called her, gave her 48 hours to return my vehicle or I report it stolen. A few days later it was left in the parking lot. My vehicle was brand new when I left. But know it looked like a bullet hole in the front bumper, a dented fender, looked like something blew up on the interior of my cars roof.

A few days later I went to burger King, as I went to open the door, the woman walks past me, carrying a new baby girl swaddled in a blanket. My world froze and she kept walking. I sat down inside, not even hungry anymore. I tried to reach out to the district attorneys for help. No one would help me. I lost the child again. 

Fast forward a year, whole on leave I met a girl in my hometown. We became an item, and eventually when I head back, I hear she's pregnant. So I start planning on moving her to base.

She did not want to. And she did not like me being in the military. She told me ""you either come back now, or in taking your child and you will NEVER see him again.

This destroyed me. So I made the worst decision I ever made and went AWOL to be back home with her and to see my child into the world.

When the day came for my son to be born, I sat in the hospital room with her waiting. There was a knock,  we expected a doctor, but instead 2 police officers and a social worker came in. They took me into the hall, handcuffed me amd took me to the county jail while my son was being born. I sat in there for 3 weeks.

One morning I got word that I was to be released with orders to fly back to my unit the next morning. They let me go, and I saw my son for the first time.

The next morning came, and I couldn't leave my child. I stayed. I became a fugitive, constantly being hunted.

My mother would tell others about my situation amd it wasn't long before people were leveraging it for their own gains. I would be bullied by other residents and if I defended myself, they would report me. My grandmother found out I got a 250 dollar bonus from my job for Christmas. She called me and said I had 1 hour to give her the 250 or else she would turn me in. So I gave her my money.

For 7 years I hid, working under the table jobs, being black mailed. I starved, I went from 190 pounds to 130 pounds. 

I missed the birth of both my children, got arrested 3 times for being AWOL and still always came back to take care of my family, since my now wife did not work ever.

My mother at one point allowed my wife and kids to stay with her, but I was not allowed to because she had told her apartment manager about what I was going thru, so yet again, I was homeless in a tent.

Finally after 7 years, I found out someone was tracking me again. I knew I had about 24 hours. But I was done. I sat there and waited. When they came, I offered no resistance, I just went. I allowed myself to be transported from the west coast to Fort Riley, despite many chances to escape again. They put me in Fort Leavenworth for 2 months and let me go with an other than honorable discharge. While sitting in headquarters I learned that the way they located me was my grandmother had called and turned me in asking for a reward.

But now I was free.

I came home, and was immediately back in the abuse.

See, since the beginning of our relationship, my wife had been mentally and physically abusive to me, ""what are you gonna do about it? YOUR AWOL! I'll just have you arrested!"" Was her favorite line.

She would tell me daily how ugly I was, how worthless I was, how I could do no better than her and that she settled for me. I wasnt allowed to shave, brush my teeth or shower without her permission or else I was a cheater. Several times she would come down the hall screaming at me out of the blue and dig her fingernails into my flesh and tear it. But I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't get help from the police, for 7 years they would of just taken me, even if they didn't take me when I was clear, where I came from, they would laugh me off and not do anything.

This continued for 11 years, her constant abuse, me being the sole provider. And then one day she decided she wanted a job.

She got a job at home for special needs people. 2 weeks in, she came home one night wearing a sweater I'd never seen and smelling like a man's cologne. I asked and she said it was her lesbian friends.

I got suspicious and dug around and found out she had some guy that used to be our neighbor who was married and had a handicapped child come from one state over and fuck her.

But that wasn't all. She had had 3 other affairs in that time, one with her own cousin.

We fought for days, me telling her to leave my home, but she wouldn't.

One evening she grabbed my .45 and walks up to me and asks ""is it loaded?"". I said yes. She points it at me and says ""all I have to do is pull the trigger. When they come, I'll just tell them you were hitting me and I did this in self defense.""

Eventually she put my gun down. After a few more hours I drip to my knees crying, I wrap my arms around her waist and beg her to stop. She pushed me off and walked out the front door in the dark.

I walked on my back porch, collapsed crying and passed out drunk. I don't know how much time passed, but soon, my phone rings, but I don't even look at it. Over and over my phone rings for quite a while, finally I look thru my tears and the dizziness from a 24 pack of beer. The number seemed familiar, but couldn't place it. At that moment my kids who were really young come running out ""dad, there's a bunch of cops with spotlights out front telling you to come out."".

I stagger to my door and am hit with so many lights and an officer on a megaphone ""turn around, put your hands in the air and walk backward to the sound of my voice."". I have no idea what's going on,  and as I comply it's really hard to walk forwards so drunk, I was afraid I was gonna fall off my steps and someone would get jumpy and I would get all these cops unloading their guns into me and possibly hitting a child.

When I hit my circular drive I'm told to drop to my knees and place my hands on top of my head. I was cuffed and put into a squad car. I ask what I'm being arrested for, but all they would say is ""what do you think?"", my response was ""because I'm drunk?"" They said ""now is that a crime to drink in your home?"", to which I replied ""no, so what am I being arrested for?"". I was told to shut up and I'll find out when his partner gets back.

Shortly later another squad car shows up, my wife gets out with a cop and they walk into my house.

I told the cop that was standing over me she was not to be in there, she is kicked out for what he did, he told me that's not my choice.

As the officers come out, I notice they have 1 of my revolvers and 2 rifles. (I had many more) my wife had given those to them because they were my favorites but didn't give them any others because she hoped to keep them.

As I'm being transported to the hospital to be cleared for jail, I'm finally told what I'm being arrested for. Assault and kidnapping. My heart stopped, I said no, I didn't do any of that! I'm then informed that it carry a mandatory 25 year sentence if convicted.

As we sit in the hospital, I'm a wreck, my heart was just ripped out, my family destroyed and now I'm facing serious charges and a 25 year sentence for something I didn't even remotely do.

I ask the officer if I could prove I'm telling the truth, if he would drop the charges. He says yes.

I pause knowing I've got one shot, if I can't prove it in my first attempt, that's it, I'm done. I say ""you have my phone, right?"" He says yes.

I say, go thru it, you will find everything there, she is lying she cheated, she did all these things. I just hugged her on my knees and asked her to stop. The cop gets my phone from his squad car leaving hospital security to watch me. He comes back in and confirms that I'm giving permission for him to go thru my phone,  I confirm and he starts.

Pretty soon ""did you call her this? How about this?"" To which I say ""yes, I absolutely did."" His response was ""I can't blame you. "". He then says ok, I'm gonna go make some calls and look into some facts. A while later he returns. He tells me my story matched 100 percent to my wife's sisters story and everything he could find.

He told me all charges were being dropped, but, because of the volatile situation and the fact I was so drunk, he didn't feel it was smart to let me go home that night, that I was going to be booked for the night in the jail and he would release me first thing in the morning.

I went back home and for nearly a month I was forced to live with her, she would not leave. Her family who lived nearby wouldn't get her. So finally I ask my mother to give her a place to stay. Just 3 months, a chance to get a job, some money and a place of her own, if she don't, then kick her out at that point.

For nearly 8 months she stayed with my mother who lived 20 minutes away. During that time, my mother dropped by 1 time to check on me, called 2 times. I sat with my pistol in my mouth trying to find the courage to pull the trigger, but couldn't.

During this time I had 2 of my 3 kids with me.my youngest was about 2 at the time, and my ex wife had taken him. One night around 3 am, I got a call from my mother, they were bringing my youngest to me, my ex was having sex next to him, drinking constantly and stealing prescriptions.

It wasn't too long before I got the truth, my disabled mother had been selling her pills, my mother was allowing these men into her home, and even serving them dinner. My mother had even, prior to this separation, had been taking her to male strip clubs.

So now I had 3 kids, no help, no money for daycare. The older 2 went to school, but the youngest didn't. So now I had to take him to a construction site with me daily. And it's hard being a dad changing diapers and keeping a child safe while building houses.

Jumping ahead about a year or so, iet a great woman. I loved her to death. Deeper than I've loved anyone to this day. But this girl was friends with all sorts, she herself was bi sexual, had been in straight relationships, lesbian relationships and was even the third in another. She went to Germany within our format month for 2 weeks, and came back with chlamydia.

For some reason, she was always afraid that her child's father and I would talk and he would tell me something about her.

I turned a blind eye, but 4 years later, after being engaged to her for a year and our wedding 3 months away, I found out she had been having sex with some woman she worked with.

I broke it off. But, she lingered, I found out what it was she was concerned i would find out, she had HPV and had not disclosed this. I wound up getting warts that I had to have removed and still battle with occasionally to this day.

Well, about this time, the pandemic hit, I was laid off within the first month. I owned the house my parents had started buying in the mid 90s. Mortage was 700 for my 2 acres with a creek, 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The new note holder asked where his money was and when I told him I'm laid off due to the lock down,  he told me that was unacceptable. I told him there were protections against this during the pandemic. 2 weeks later, I had court papers hung on my property letting me know we were going into foreclosure. 

During this period I met another woman. She and I started dating and she found out about my situation. She lived about 50 miles away and offered me and my children to live with her and rebuild our life together.

Now this one gave me lots of red flags, real quick with pet names, talking about marriage within the first month or so of our relationship, but due to my circumstances, I was limited on where to go to keep my kids together and safe. So we began the move. It was December, I was a houndsman with a pack of 4 hounds, I had 2 goats, 3 ducks and 20 chickens. While moving this distance, I would show back up to my property early in the morning and in the evening to tend my animals.

One day I show back up, and my kennels are open, my dogs are gone, my goats are gone and there's a note from the sheriff that they had seized my animals for abandonment. I contacted them and set up a meeting with the undersheriff. He and the animal control officer sat in the room, and the sheriff told me before starting the recording that him and this guy wore the same uniform and that he will side with him no matter what.

The animal control officer got a noise complaint about my guns, when they showed up and couldn't get in contact with me, they looked thru my windows and saw that the house was nearly empty, so he seized my animals, despite each dog having tags with 3 phone numbers to contact me. 

I proved they my security cameras that I did not abandon, that I was there 2 times per day to care for them.

The sheriff says he will give my dogs back, but it's 100 bucks per animal I need to pay the shelter.

That was 600 bucks to get my 4 dogs and 2 goats back, even though I was innocent, just weeks before Christmas. I could only afford my dogs, so they kept my goats and sold them to butcher.

So now we are in the new home with this woman, and I notice she has books about how to keep a man, how to make a man love you, she would talk manipulation tactics with my daughter. One day I came home early, and caught her screaming in the room at my daughter about me. I stood there and waited. She came down the hall and her expression changed ""oh hey baby"". We argued a bit and that was it.

It wasn't long after that I found out my 13 year old daughter had been talking to adult men online, getting inappropriate pictures, ditching school, smoking,drinking and lying about her whereabouts.

I took her computer away, grounded her and made her do push-ups for lying to me for about 5 minutes. I thought I handled it right.

About the time omnicron varient came out, I caught covid. I was laying in bed on a Sunday, feeling dead,when there's a knock and there's sheriff's at the door. I put on my mask and go to speak to them. They start asking about my 13 year old daughter and if they can speak to her. That they had gotten a concerning report.

So I get my daughter and I go back in. About 5 minutes later they tell me they are taking her to the hospital for evaluation because she made specific suicidal threats. They told me I should hear from the hospital soon.

Over 2 hours passed and no call, so I began calling. I would get hung up on, put on hold for an hour and just generally stonewalled for nearly 2 weeks. Now I have sole custody, legal and physical of all 3 kids. I told the hospital this and asked why they were withholding my daughter and information from me, why I couldn't see my daughter. They told me she was in protective custody and getting sent to an institution and hung up on me.

Pretty soon social workers show up. They tell me that grounding my child for 2 weeks to the house and property, taking away her computer and internet access and making her do push-ups is child abuse. 

I call my mother, because I found a letter in my daughters things from her where she had made plans to come get her one night while I was in ju jitsu and help her run away 200 miles to her new home. I ask my mother why she would do this to me amd my family. And in a cold unrecognizable tone, she said, ""because I'm angry with you for not letting me be around them.""

I won the court case, but now my daughter was back. She continued stealing, I was forced by social services to allow her to what she wanted when she wanted, like go to the teen center whenever she wanted for however long she wanted and I could not supervise, if I did not, it would be abuse and neglect because she said she suicidal. She would go there and 18 year old boys would have sex with her in cars, I found this out years later from her brother.

She kept telling my boys ""dad better get in line or I'll have him put in line"" ""if I don't get to go stay with my mom, I will make it my mission to destroy dad's life."" Social services showed up 3 more times to investigate new allegations that she and my mother would make.

In this time I also found out my current girlfriend of the time I had been enabling this, putting her in touch with grandma and her mother, encouraging her to do these things. I figured it was so I would be hurt and she could come in amd play super hero and win me over.

I later found out I was correct, she had described a manipulation technique that she read about called ""the white knight"" to my daughter and son, and she attempted to employ it on me.

So when I found this out, she wanted me out of the house immediately, I agreed to move ASAP, but she said no, not good enough, if I have to get an emergency order to get you out tomorrow, I will.

So the next night, when I come home from work, she starts screaming at me. She starts yelling about me having HPV, (I told her this before we did anything so she would be aware, make her decision amd we could work to be safe) in front of my children, which was wrong and gross. I asked her to stop, she didn't. My kids were now standing there watching her yell this and I attempted to cover her mouth, but before I even reached out she screamed bloody murder and tore the skin from my face nearly putting out my eye.

I just walked off, went to bed and said forget it. The next day she was gone. She didn't come back. But the cops did. I told them what happened. They said they came with every intention of arresting me, but after hearing my story and confirming it with the kids, they decided not to. They told me I had 24 hours to leave, if I did not, they would arrest me under some form of a felony.

So I packed what I could in the SUV, loaded up my kids and we slept in a parking lot for nearly a week. I left my hounds, but kept coming back in the night to feed and care for them.

I stayed with my boss at the time, he was an old guy. But he let me and the kids stay there. I was there about a month, but wasn't having luck getting into any form of housing. Where I came from, to even get a crappy apartment, you needed a 650 credit score.

I had around a 515 from robbing Peter to pay paul most my life trying to make ends meet. I couldn't continue imposing on this guy, and it was tough being in a tiny room with all my kids. So I started looking for a roommate situation where we could have normality and more space.

Some older woman was renting out a few rooms on her 20 acre property. I reached out amd met her, she agreed to allow us to live there and my hounds were welcome. So we went there.

Not even 2 weeks in, I notice my tools start disappearing, items in my room would be moved or gone. She was legitimate crazy. She would talk about waiting for me to come home and hitting me in the back of the head with a baseball bat to my kids. One day while I was at work, her and her daughter call me, they tell me to come bury my dog, they shot her because she wouldn't shut up. But then in the same breath, they threaten to shoot me as well when I come out.

Of course the police weren't interested in helping me. So I collected what I could of my belongings, grabbed my kids and left, I couldn't get an apartment with my animals, and by taking them, I chose them over my kids and was dooming them to be in this situation forever. I lost the rest of what i loved that day.

I found an old woman that managed some apartments, she liked me, and decided that even though my credit wasn't what she wanted, she would give me a home. We moved into our first home in a little over a year after becoming homeless.

Things went well, I started dating someone I had known for a year, I had a great job at a mill. But I needed hand surgery for an injury that I had had for nearly 4 years. When I was undergoing the operation, my oldest son decided without telling me, that he wanted to see if his mom had changed. He was 15. He reached out to her, told her where we lived and met up with her, after she had abandoned them all.

I allowed him to as he pleased with her, so long as he didn't leave town amd she didn't have my exact address. Their relationship went for nearly 8 months when I was served papers. Now she wanted in the baby's life, who was now 7 and didn't even know her.

 About this time though I had started the process of buying a home across the country. I wanted a new start and new life. I had worked hard to get my credit score to 690 and was ready.

So off I went. I thought it was gonna be great, I mean gas where I came from was 6 bucks a gallon, now I'm paying 2.38. I took a big pay cut, I went from 40 bucks an hour to 20 bucks here doing construction. But I was alright. Then I thought it was gonna get better. My new boss wanted to retire, he offered me his 20 year old company, I just needed 30k down. I started being taught to do estimates for him. I did 12. But was understood by illegal immigrants on everyone of them. In the meantime, work the company did have, he sub contracted out, went on vacation amd laid me off for a month just doing estimates.

Mortage fell behind, bills fell behind. I asked my girlfriend to help me for a few months, she wasn't too happy. She paid 1 month, and didn't after that.

Now I sit here dealing with the depression, the suicidal thoughts. My relationship is falling apart.

This is the abridged version of my life. I left out tons of stories, information amd other things.

I've never talked about this stuff to anyone, I carry it silently always hopeful. But I'm scared now. I've battled depression a long time, baddepression, but never this bad. In a few days it's been 2 months of feeling this.

I have no family or friends, and I don't want a therapist.

I guess this was my attempt to talk, and make myself feel a little more ok.

If you've read this far thank you for hearing me.

But please, if you feel compelled to comment or message me, don't attack me. I'm not proud of what I did leaving the army. I'm not proud to have an STI. It's all dishonorable and disgusting, I know. But it's part of my story, amd for once, I wanted to tell even those parts.

"My life, abridged",MentalHealthSupport,1hrdvm7,2025-01-01 17:06:24,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1hrdvm7/my_life_abridged/,Agitated-Leading9231,Other,"Another new year, and yet, I know deep down inside, this year won't be any better than the last. 

I'm 38, and I have yet to have a good year, or even a good month, in my entire life. Matter of fact, 2025 is starting off to show me that this year, things may turn worse than ever. 

I try to find the strength and the will every day to carry on, to mask my pain so that I can be strong for those around me, but it's becoming harder by the day for me to even do that. 

We can start from the beginning, abridged version of course, because to write everything would take me forever, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have the patience to read it.

My childhood was stolen from me. My father's first attempt on my life that I remember (because of the traumatic acts that happened) was when I was 3. He locked my mother and I in a trailer and lit it on fire. We got out, my mom got me in her car,  front passenger seat and we started to back out as a steel tool chest snagged the window over my face from my father throwing it. That was the first real memory of my father. 

After my mom went back to him a few months later, things didn't get any better. For the next 13 years, my father locked me in my room, I was not allowed to cross the bedroom threshold. I was given a ketchup bottle full of water everyday, and that was to last me until bed time. If I needed to go to the bathroom, I had to wait for my father to pass by my room and get his permission. I wasnt allowed toys, or to talk to my mother, talk to myself, make ""sound effects"". I was allowed books, paper and pencils. 

My father, who claimed disability by the time I was 6, spent his days trying to catch me breaking one of these rules. He would sneak down the hall, stand there and wait for extended periods. If he couldn't catch me doing something, he would come up with a reason to punish me. My punishments were typically severe beatings with foreign objects that would leave bruising, blood blisters, and in some cases, lacerations. I would be kept from school until I healed. 

When I wasn't in my room, my father would have me on our property in the middle of nowhere cutting fields on my hands and knees with scissors, pulling star thistle bare handed. He would make piles of rocks taller than me with his tractor, then give me 2 5 gallon buckets and then I would fill them to the top, because if I didn't, I was beaten. Them I would carry both buckets at the same time about an acre, make a new pile. I would move then from one side of the property to the other, all day, every day, weather did not matter, from dawn till dark. 

Other times, my punishment was to stand in the corner from about 8 am to 6pm, break was given at lunch and dinner. Or writing,  literally, 1 million times a phrase that he felt I needed. 

I got in a fight at school when I was about 8. It was right after Christmas. I begged the teacher not to send a letter home. I didn't want my dad to take my presents away and hit me. Needless to say, they still sent the letter. 

Not long after that, at 9 years old, I decided to run away from home. I lived in the middle of nowhere and figured I'd live like the Indians did. I made it a few miles, chasing a few deer and squirrels along the way thinking I could get them to eat, and then the police found me. They took me back to my parents. I was beaten senseless and stood in the corner for 10 hours a day. 

About this time a worker from child protective services showed up unannounced. My father rushed me to my room, kicked my foot prints out of the push carpet and an investigation was launched. 

My mother and father denied all wrong songs, saying I was a liar and a troubled child.

I was put on 3 years of probation, made to pick up cans along the roadways to pay a fine, I was put in scared straight where they locked me in the county jail and allowed inmates to yell and scream at me, threaten me etc.

Meal time, I was fed separate from my family, I sat at a bar with my back to the dinner table. My dad would feed his cat at food next to me. The cats fall would be in my plate, in my face, but I couldn't tell her no, I couldn't move her, or her overwhelming smelling at food, and I could ask anyone to move her for me. 

Bed time was at 5:30 pm.

I wasn't allowed to see my extended family such as aunts, grandparents etc. If they came over, which was really rare, I stayed in my room with strict instructions to not speak. If someone was to speak to me, I was to answer, but carefully, and not engage in extended conversation. If i displeased him with my interaction, he would give me a look and I knew when they left, what was in store for me. 

My mother left my father many times during my childhood, but each time went back just a few weeks or months later. One of the times when she left him, I picked up kickboxing unbeknownst to my father. 

When I was 13,she left him again. This time she stayed gone for over a year. During this time, I wanted to find a job in the small town I lived in. I wanted to save up for a car when I was 16. I was now just barely 14. I got on my bike and ride around town, hanging fliers and asking around. As I rode along the side of highway 99, a red pickup hit me in my chest, then drove halfway up my legs, threw it in reverse and backed over me. 

I stayed conscious the whole time, unsure of if I was gonna survive. Everything was broken in my left side except a few ribs, my back or my neck. My left foot had all the flesh and muscle torn off, 368 stitches, inside and out and the possibility of a skin graft to put it together. My right arm was snapped in half,  multiple broken bones on the right side, but not as bad as my left. I was bedridden for nearly 6 months, in a wheelchair for a year. I was told I would never play a ssport again, run again or even walk without a sever limp. But I proved them all wrong. 

Shortly after I was walking again, I got caught by my mother with a playboy magazine in my room. She wasn't happy. She called my father who lived a few miles away. The next morning while I slept, my mother had my father come over. He burst in my room, drug me out of bed, the me down, which really hurt from the injuries I was still recovering from. He then proceeded to throw me out of my mother's house telling me to never be seen again. I was just over 15. I or some clothes in my back pack, hugged my cat good bye and started walking down the dirt road. 

I didn't know where to go or what to do. I went to the elementary school, they were closed for some sort of break, and i sat on the tables outside, wondering. Then I saw a big red plastic turtle shaped sandbox, it's shell was the lid. It was getting late, dark would be here shortly, so I went to the sandbox, opened the lid, curled up in the sand, pulled the lid over me and fell asleep for the night. 

The next morning, I heard voices outside my sand box. They sounded familiar, like one of my friends and his sister. They were playing. I came out to go play with them. They were surprised, needless to say, to see me come out of nowhere. They asked, and I told them I was staying there, I had no home. They played for a while and then they left. 

Not long after that I saw them coming back, but they had an adult with them who I assumed was their mom. I ran to my box, closed the lid and hid. She came over and tried to convince me to come out. But I was afraid I was gonna be in trouble, so I stayed quite and didn't come out, she didn't open the lid, but instead left. A few more minutes later I heard a vehicle, some footsteps and then a man's voice telling me to get out of the title and come with him. I complied it off fear that my father had insulted in me. 

It was my friends dad. His mom had went and got him. They took me to their home which was 2 doors down from my mother's. I was terrified my father would see me nearby and punish me. But the man that took me in held a black belt, and assured me i was safe, and that they would take care of me.

About a year passed, I was 16 now, my mother had moved and went back to my father in the time I was gone. She also left him again. She got an apartment one town down. It wasn't long until she called me multiple times begging me to come home. I finally did, on the condition that she don't go back to him. 

I continued my training in kickboxing, wrestled on the highschool wrestling team, I played football my sophomore and junior year, I got into weightlifting. Things were going great. Then she went back, again. 

This time, as I was isolated in my room eating my meal on my floor, my dad came in, yelling at me, he swung his fork near my face, I bobbed my head out of the way. He said ""oh, you think your a tough guy now because you know Kung fu huh?""

I said ""No, I don't think I am. I know I am. "". His eyes turned to stone and I knew what was coming. I stood up,  now over an inch taller than my father. He tried to hit me,I blocked it, gave him a quick jab and a hard back round to the leg. The fight was done.

He went to his room, grabbed his pistol and came back. He told me I had an hour to get out of his house. 

I called my friend, who I had met at my dojo. He was around 25 at the time. He was part of the 101st airborne and part of the initial invasion force into Iraq. He was an amateur MMA fighter, who shortly, would go pro under Ken Shamrock. He showed up to get me 10 minutes later, which was impressive, since he lived 25 minutes away, minimum. His radio was loud, which I knew would anger my dad. I got in his car and he proceeded to spin donuts in my dad's yard, which was one of his pride and joys. I told my friend ""dude, my dad's gonna be pissed."". My friend laughed and said ""so what? What's he gonna do about it?"". And we were off. 

I stayed the night with my friend. He didn't have any food, a small apartment in a rough neighborhood.  He struggled to make ends meet. We at raw potatoes with Sriracha for most meals when I was around. It wasn't long and I felt like I was a burden. I made up a story and left.

I found a bridge along the river. It had some spots I could stay dry and protected from the wind, so that's where I stayed at night. 

I dropped out of high-school. I barely went to the dojo. I was dating my senseis daughter, and she noticed my absence in school and class. She brought it up to my sensei, who investigated and eventually discovered I was an homeless kid. 

He took me in, gave me care, treated me well, and that's where I stayed until I turned 18.

At 18 I got my first apartment. I met an older woman who was 30. We started hanging out together and became an item. Prior to my departure to the army, I found out she was pregnant. I was so happy to be a father, I saw it as a chance to break the cycle of bad father's. I wanted to be a good one. 

I headed off to boot camp, and about halfway thru, I got a letter from the woman who was carrying my child. She said she had a miscarriage. The baby was so sick, it's skin was transparent. It has blue eyes and blonde hair. 

I grieved the loss of my child thru bootcamp, AIT and airborne school. I got letters from my mother telling me that lady had taken my vehicle and went to Arizona. She was still married. That she had been taking all my money. 

I flew home for leave, and called her, gave her 48 hours to return my vehicle or I report it stolen. A few days later it was left in the parking lot. My vehicle was brand new when I left. But know it looked like a bullet hole in the front bumper, a dented fender, looked like something blew up on the interior of my cars roof.

A few days later I went to burger King, as I went to open the door, the woman walks past me, carrying a new baby girl swaddled in a blanket. My world froze and she kept walking. I sat down inside, not even hungry anymore. I tried to reach out to the district attorneys for help. No one would help me. I lost the child again. 

Fast forward a year, whole on leave I met a girl in my hometown. We became an item, and eventually when I head back, I hear she's pregnant. So I start planning on moving her to base.

She did not want to. And she did not like me being in the military. She told me ""you either come back now, or in taking your child and you will NEVER see him again.

This destroyed me. So I made the worst decision I ever made and went AWOL to be back home with her and to see my child into the world.

When the day came for my son to be born, I sat in the hospital room with her waiting. There was a knock,  we expected a doctor, but instead 2 police officers and a social worker came in. They took me into the hall, handcuffed me amd took me to the county jail while my son was being born. I sat in there for 3 weeks.

One morning I got word that I was to be released with orders to fly back to my unit the next morning. They let me go, and I saw my son for the first time.

The next morning came, and I couldn't leave my child. I stayed. I became a fugitive, constantly being hunted.

My mother would tell others about my situation amd it wasn't long before people were leveraging it for their own gains. I would be bullied by other residents and if I defended myself, they would report me. My grandmother found out I got a 250 dollar bonus from my job for Christmas. She called me and said I had 1 hour to give her the 250 or else she would turn me in. So I gave her my money.

For 7 years I hid, working under the table jobs, being black mailed. I starved, I went from 190 pounds to 130 pounds. 

I missed the birth of both my children, got arrested 3 times for being AWOL and still always came back to take care of my family, since my now wife did not work ever.

My mother at one point allowed my wife and kids to stay with her, but I was not allowed to because she had told her apartment manager about what I was going thru, so yet again, I was homeless in a tent.

Finally after 7 years, I found out someone was tracking me again. I knew I had about 24 hours. But I was done. I sat there and waited. When they came, I offered no resistance, I just went. I allowed myself to be transported from the west coast to Fort Riley, despite many chances to escape again. They put me in Fort Leavenworth for 2 months and let me go with an other than honorable discharge. While sitting in headquarters I learned that the way they located me was my grandmother had called and turned me in asking for a reward.

But now I was free.

I came home, and was immediately back in the abuse.

See, since the beginning of our relationship, my wife had been mentally and physically abusive to me, ""what are you gonna do about it? YOUR AWOL! I'll just have you arrested!"" Was her favorite line.

She would tell me daily how ugly I was, how worthless I was, how I could do no better than her and that she settled for me. I wasnt allowed to shave, brush my teeth or shower without her permission or else I was a cheater. Several times she would come down the hall screaming at me out of the blue and dig her fingernails into my flesh and tear it. But I couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't get help from the police, for 7 years they would of just taken me, even if they didn't take me when I was clear, where I came from, they would laugh me off and not do anything.

This continued for 11 years, her constant abuse, me being the sole provider. And then one day she decided she wanted a job.

She got a job at home for special needs people. 2 weeks in, she came home one night wearing a sweater I'd never seen and smelling like a man's cologne. I asked and she said it was her lesbian friends.

I got suspicious and dug around and found out she had some guy that used to be our neighbor who was married and had a handicapped child come from one state over and fuck her.

But that wasn't all. She had had 3 other affairs in that time, one with her own cousin.

We fought for days, me telling her to leave my home, but she wouldn't.

One evening she grabbed my .45 and walks up to me and asks ""is it loaded?"". I said yes. She points it at me and says ""all I have to do is pull the trigger. When they come, I'll just tell them you were hitting me and I did this in self defense.""

Eventually she put my gun down. After a few more hours I drip to my knees crying, I wrap my arms around her waist and beg her to stop. She pushed me off and walked out the front door in the dark.

I walked on my back porch, collapsed crying and passed out drunk. I don't know how much time passed, but soon, my phone rings, but I don't even look at it. Over and over my phone rings for quite a while, finally I look thru my tears and the dizziness from a 24 pack of beer. The number seemed familiar, but couldn't place it. At that moment my kids who were really young come running out ""dad, there's a bunch of cops with spotlights out front telling you to come out."".

I stagger to my door and am hit with so many lights and an officer on a megaphone ""turn around, put your hands in the air and walk backward to the sound of my voice."". I have no idea what's going on,  and as I comply it's really hard to walk forwards so drunk, I was afraid I was gonna fall off my steps and someone would get jumpy and I would get all these cops unloading their guns into me and possibly hitting a child.

When I hit my circular drive I'm told to drop to my knees and place my hands on top of my head. I was cuffed and put into a squad car. I ask what I'm being arrested for, but all they would say is ""what do you think?"", my response was ""because I'm drunk?"" They said ""now is that a crime to drink in your home?"", to which I replied ""no, so what am I being arrested for?"". I was told to shut up and I'll find out when his partner gets back.

Shortly later another squad car shows up, my wife gets out with a cop and they walk into my house.

I told the cop that was standing over me she was not to be in there, she is kicked out for what he did, he told me that's not my choice.

As the officers come out, I notice they have 1 of my revolvers and 2 rifles. (I had many more) my wife had given those to them because they were my favorites but didn't give them any others because she hoped to keep them.

As I'm being transported to the hospital to be cleared for jail, I'm finally told what I'm being arrested for. Assault and kidnapping. My heart stopped, I said no, I didn't do any of that! I'm then informed that it carry a mandatory 25 year sentence if convicted.

As we sit in the hospital, I'm a wreck, my heart was just ripped out, my family destroyed and now I'm facing serious charges and a 25 year sentence for something I didn't even remotely do.

I ask the officer if I could prove I'm telling the truth, if he would drop the charges. He says yes.

I pause knowing I've got one shot, if I can't prove it in my first attempt, that's it, I'm done. I say ""you have my phone, right?"" He says yes.

I say, go thru it, you will find everything there, she is lying she cheated, she did all these things. I just hugged her on my knees and asked her to stop. The cop gets my phone from his squad car leaving hospital security to watch me. He comes back in and confirms that I'm giving permission for him to go thru my phone,  I confirm and he starts.

Pretty soon ""did you call her this? How about this?"" To which I say ""yes, I absolutely did."" His response was ""I can't blame you. "". He then says ok, I'm gonna go make some calls and look into some facts. A while later he returns. He tells me my story matched 100 percent to my wife's sisters story and everything he could find.

He told me all charges were being dropped, but, because of the volatile situation and the fact I was so drunk, he didn't feel it was smart to let me go home that night, that I was going to be booked for the night in the jail and he would release me first thing in the morning.

I went back home and for nearly a month I was forced to live with her, she would not leave. Her family who lived nearby wouldn't get her. So finally I ask my mother to give her a place to stay. Just 3 months, a chance to get a job, some money and a place of her own, if she don't, then kick her out at that point.

For nearly 8 months she stayed with my mother who lived 20 minutes away. During that time, my mother dropped by 1 time to check on me, called 2 times. I sat with my pistol in my mouth trying to find the courage to pull the trigger, but couldn't.

During this time I had 2 of my 3 kids with me.my youngest was about 2 at the time, and my ex wife had taken him. One night around 3 am, I got a call from my mother, they were bringing my youngest to me, my ex was having sex next to him, drinking constantly and stealing prescriptions.

It wasn't too long before I got the truth, my disabled mother had been selling her pills, my mother was allowing these men into her home, and even serving them dinner. My mother had even, prior to this separation, had been taking her to male strip clubs.

So now I had 3 kids, no help, no money for daycare. The older 2 went to school, but the youngest didn't. So now I had to take him to a construction site with me daily. And it's hard being a dad changing diapers and keeping a child safe while building houses.

Jumping ahead about a year or so, iet a great woman. I loved her to death. Deeper than I've loved anyone to this day. But this girl was friends with all sorts, she herself was bi sexual, had been in straight relationships, lesbian relationships and was even the third in another. She went to Germany within our format month for 2 weeks, and came back with chlamydia.

For some reason, she was always afraid that her child's father and I would talk and he would tell me something about her.

I turned a blind eye, but 4 years later, after being engaged to her for a year and our wedding 3 months away, I found out she had been having sex with some woman she worked with.

I broke it off. But, she lingered, I found out what it was she was concerned i would find out, she had HPV and had not disclosed this. I wound up getting warts that I had to have removed and still battle with occasionally to this day.

Well, about this time, the pandemic hit, I was laid off within the first month. I owned the house my parents had started buying in the mid 90s. Mortage was 700 for my 2 acres with a creek, 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. The new note holder asked where his money was and when I told him I'm laid off due to the lock down,  he told me that was unacceptable. I told him there were protections against this during the pandemic. 2 weeks later, I had court papers hung on my property letting me know we were going into foreclosure. 

During this period I met another woman. She and I started dating and she found out about my situation. She lived about 50 miles away and offered me and my children to live with her and rebuild our life together.

Now this one gave me lots of red flags, real quick with pet names, talking about marriage within the first month or so of our relationship, but due to my circumstances, I was limited on where to go to keep my kids together and safe. So we began the move. It was December, I was a houndsman with a pack of 4 hounds, I had 2 goats, 3 ducks and 20 chickens. While moving this distance, I would show back up to my property early in the morning and in the evening to tend my animals.

One day I show back up, and my kennels are open, my dogs are gone, my goats are gone and there's a note from the sheriff that they had seized my animals for abandonment. I contacted them and set up a meeting with the undersheriff. He and the animal control officer sat in the room, and the sheriff told me before starting the recording that him and this guy wore the same uniform and that he will side with him no matter what.

The animal control officer got a noise complaint about my guns, when they showed up and couldn't get in contact with me, they looked thru my windows and saw that the house was nearly empty, so he seized my animals, despite each dog having tags with 3 phone numbers to contact me. 

I proved they my security cameras that I did not abandon, that I was there 2 times per day to care for them.

The sheriff says he will give my dogs back, but it's 100 bucks per animal I need to pay the shelter.

That was 600 bucks to get my 4 dogs and 2 goats back, even though I was innocent, just weeks before Christmas. I could only afford my dogs, so they kept my goats and sold them to butcher.

So now we are in the new home with this woman, and I notice she has books about how to keep a man, how to make a man love you, she would talk manipulation tactics with my daughter. One day I came home early, and caught her screaming in the room at my daughter about me. I stood there and waited. She came down the hall and her expression changed ""oh hey baby"". We argued a bit and that was it.

It wasn't long after that I found out my 13 year old daughter had been talking to adult men online, getting inappropriate pictures, ditching school, smoking,drinking and lying about her whereabouts.

I took her computer away, grounded her and made her do push-ups for lying to me for about 5 minutes. I thought I handled it right.

About the time omnicron varient came out, I caught covid. I was laying in bed on a Sunday, feeling dead,when there's a knock and there's sheriff's at the door. I put on my mask and go to speak to them. They start asking about my 13 year old daughter and if they can speak to her. That they had gotten a concerning report.

So I get my daughter and I go back in. About 5 minutes later they tell me they are taking her to the hospital for evaluation because she made specific suicidal threats. They told me I should hear from the hospital soon.

Over 2 hours passed and no call, so I began calling. I would get hung up on, put on hold for an hour and just generally stonewalled for nearly 2 weeks. Now I have sole custody, legal and physical of all 3 kids. I told the hospital this and asked why they were withholding my daughter and information from me, why I couldn't see my daughter. They told me she was in protective custody and getting sent to an institution and hung up on me.

Pretty soon social workers show up. They tell me that grounding my child for 2 weeks to the house and property, taking away her computer and internet access and making her do push-ups is child abuse. 

I call my mother, because I found a letter in my daughters things from her where she had made plans to come get her one night while I was in ju jitsu and help her run away 200 miles to her new home. I ask my mother why she would do this to me amd my family. And in a cold unrecognizable tone, she said, ""because I'm angry with you for not letting me be around them.""

I won the court case, but now my daughter was back. She continued stealing, I was forced by social services to allow her to what she wanted when she wanted, like go to the teen center whenever she wanted for however long she wanted and I could not supervise, if I did not, it would be abuse and neglect because she said she suicidal. She would go there and 18 year old boys would have sex with her in cars, I found this out years later from her brother.

She kept telling my boys ""dad better get in line or I'll have him put in line"" ""if I don't get to go stay with my mom, I will make it my mission to destroy dad's life."" Social services showed up 3 more times to investigate new allegations that she and my mother would make.

In this time I also found out my current girlfriend of the time I had been enabling this, putting her in touch with grandma and her mother, encouraging her to do these things. I figured it was so I would be hurt and she could come in amd play super hero and win me over.

I later found out I was correct, she had described a manipulation technique that she read about called ""the white knight"" to my daughter and son, and she attempted to employ it on me.

So when I found this out, she wanted me out of the house immediately, I agreed to move ASAP, but she said no, not good enough, if I have to get an emergency order to get you out tomorrow, I will.

So the next night, when I come home from work, she starts screaming at me. She starts yelling about me having HPV, (I told her this before we did anything so she would be aware, make her decision amd we could work to be safe) in front of my children, which was wrong and gross. I asked her to stop, she didn't. My kids were now standing there watching her yell this and I attempted to cover her mouth, but before I even reached out she screamed bloody murder and tore the skin from my face nearly putting out my eye.

I just walked off, went to bed and said forget it. The next day she was gone. She didn't come back. But the cops did. I told them what happened. They said they came with every intention of arresting me, but after hearing my story and confirming it with the kids, they decided not to. They told me I had 24 hours to leave, if I did not, they would arrest me under some form of a felony.

So I packed what I could in the SUV, loaded up my kids and we slept in a parking lot for nearly a week. I left my hounds, but kept coming back in the night to feed and care for them.

I stayed with my boss at the time, he was an old guy. But he let me and the kids stay there. I was there about a month, but wasn't having luck getting into any form of housing. Where I came from, to even get a crappy apartment, you needed a 650 credit score.

I had around a 515 from robbing Peter to pay paul most my life trying to make ends meet. I couldn't continue imposing on this guy, and it was tough being in a tiny room with all my kids. So I started looking for a roommate situation where we could have normality and more space.

Some older woman was renting out a few rooms on her 20 acre property. I reached out amd met her, she agreed to allow us to live there and my hounds were welcome. So we went there.

Not even 2 weeks in, I notice my tools start disappearing, items in my room would be moved or gone. She was legitimate crazy. She would talk about waiting for me to come home and hitting me in the back of the head with a baseball bat to my kids. One day while I was at work, her and her daughter call me, they tell me to come bury my dog, they shot her because she wouldn't shut up. But then in the same breath, they threaten to shoot me as well when I come out.

Of course the police weren't interested in helping me. So I collected what I could of my belongings, grabbed my kids and left, I couldn't get an apartment with my animals, and by taking them, I chose them over my kids and was dooming them to be in this situation forever. I lost the rest of what i loved that day.

I found an old woman that managed some apartments, she liked me, and decided that even though my credit wasn't what she wanted, she would give me a home. We moved into our first home in a little over a year after becoming homeless.

Things went well, I started dating someone I had known for a year, I had a great job at a mill. But I needed hand surgery for an injury that I had had for nearly 4 years. When I was undergoing the operation, my oldest son decided without telling me, that he wanted to see if his mom had changed. He was 15. He reached out to her, told her where we lived and met up with her, after she had abandoned them all.

I allowed him to as he pleased with her, so long as he didn't leave town amd she didn't have my exact address. Their relationship went for nearly 8 months when I was served papers. Now she wanted in the baby's life, who was now 7 and didn't even know her.

 About this time though I had started the process of buying a home across the country. I wanted a new start and new life. I had worked hard to get my credit score to 690 and was ready.

So off I went. I thought it was gonna be great, I mean gas where I came from was 6 bucks a gallon, now I'm paying 2.38. I took a big pay cut, I went from 40 bucks an hour to 20 bucks here doing construction. But I was alright. Then I thought it was gonna get better. My new boss wanted to retire, he offered me his 20 year old company, I just needed 30k down. I started being taught to do estimates for him. I did 12. But was understood by illegal immigrants on everyone of them. In the meantime, work the company did have, he sub contracted out, went on vacation amd laid me off for a month just doing estimates.

Mortage fell behind, bills fell behind. I asked my girlfriend to help me for a few months, she wasn't too happy. She paid 1 month, and didn't after that.

Now I sit here dealing with the depression, the suicidal thoughts. My relationship is falling apart.

This is the abridged version of my life. I left out tons of stories, information amd other things.

I've never talked about this stuff to anyone, I carry it silently always hopeful. But I'm scared now. I've battled depression a long time, baddepression, but never this bad. In a few days it's been 2 months of feeling this.

I have no family or friends, and I don't want a therapist.

I guess this was my attempt to talk, and make myself feel a little more ok.

If you've read this far thank you for hearing me.

But please, if you feel compelled to comment or message me, don't attack me. I'm not proud of what I did leaving the army. I'm not proud to have an STI. It's all dishonorable and disgusting, I know. But it's part of my story, amd for once, I wanted to tell even those parts.


"
Top 10 New to me of 2024,boardgames,1hr2zgt,2025-01-01 08:31:38,14,0.81,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hr2zgt/top_10_new_to_me_of_2024/,Jedi_Master_Shane,,"

It’s that time again for top 10 lists, mine is my personnel top 10 games of 2024 that were new to me. I think it’s been a good year for games, with my own highlights being attending the UKGE at Birmingham and Aircon at Harrogate where I managed to demo a lot of good games . The ones that stick out are, TableTop Inc (formerly Meeple Inc because you can apparently trademark a Meeple…enough about that), this is one of my most anticipated games of 2025 from a great bunch of people at Cotswold games, I really hope it does well. We played World Order at UKGE and it was amazing, instantly recognisable as being part of the Hegenomy world but a distinctly different game and another one I’m looking forward to arriving in 2025. I also, as always accumulated more games for my shelf of  opportunity, stand out titles being Salton Sea, Callisto 2200, Sand and Age of Comics. Before I get into the top 10, special mentions need to go to Coutiers-such a great filler game, Cities, Sky Team and Harmonies.

SO, in reverse order:-

10. Weirdwood Manor- A great co-op with nice mechanics and gorgeous components, lots of replayability with the different characters and bosses to beat.

9. Hamlet by the Lake- Having only played Hamlet with the expansion “By the Lake” I would never play it without it. Gorgeous Village building/tile laying game with clever choices to make as you try to construct the Church to turn your Village to a Hamlet.

8. Red Cathedral- Devir games knock it out of the park again with a lot of game in a smallish box for under £30. Really nice dice draughting/roundel style action selection to gather resources to build sections of the cathedral. 

7. Mythwind- A Gorgeous town building sandbox game, each character plays its own mini game as you explore and interact with other villagers and natives. I played this A LOT and need to pick it back up.

6. Ezra & Nehemiha- Another smallish box game from Gamlyn, plays like a greatest hits of their other titles, a little overwhelming at first but once you get your head around the card play it all falls into place. It’s one of those games where you want to do everything but have to make some tactical choices on where to concentrate your efforts.

5. WIndmill Valley- It wouldn’t be a list without a title from Board & Dice, one of the prettiest games around as you control water flow rates to reveal actions on your wheel in order to gather and plant Tulips-sounds straightforward, but its very tactical as you try and plan ahead for optimal moves.

4. Terminus- I was lucky enough to demo this at UKGE and it immediately had me hooked, I’d missed the kickstarter but still was lucky enough to get my hands on a copy. Inside Up games really have a hit with this one as you try and plan out a cities underground network through the way in which you move around a rondel style action selection that you can only travel round so many times, so clever planning is required. Superb game.

3. Shackelton Base- A great worker placement base building game with lovely components, great rule book and the longevity of the variety that comes with which corporations you select (3 from 7), they all play completely differently. Everything about this game is just superb, a crunchy, thinking mid weight Euro.

2. Hegenomy- Only managed to play this for the first time this year and OMG! For what could be deemed a dull theme, how this game conveys the symbiotic relationship between the 4 classes is so clever. It has a high complexity rating (according to BGG, but as everyone knows their rating system is flawed at best), this only comes from the fact that each class plays completely differently but both the rule book and player reference cards are outstanding and by the end of turn 2 you will have the hang of it. Everyone should play this game at least once, it’s so good!

1. Andromedas Edge- Having toyed with the idea of purchasing Dwellings of Eldervale for a long time, when I first cast my eyes on this as a spiritual successor but Sci-Fi I was intrigued, BUT, passed on the kickstarter. Then I watched a pre-view video on YouTube and kicked myself. Luckily I managed to snag an all in pledge courtesy of E-bay for a not astronomical price, it’s still a lot for a board game, but it’s my hobby. This game really hits the spot for me, I love worker placement games and one of my favourites has always been Energy Empire, you can see its DNA here, Luke Laurie being the common factor. The act of placing workers is one thing, but the clever retreval system to activate your space station is so so good. The full pimped up version is mammoth, organisation taken care of with Game Trays fantastic system and the minis and various expansions are amazing. Yes the game takes a wee while to set up, even when you are familiar with it, and the game has thre points targets to dictate game length (I always play on maximum length), BUT, the game is that good that even after a 2 hour plus game, my first thought is to play again with a different faction- there are lots to choose from! Solo play has one of the most intuitive systems going that feels like an intelligent opponent with a variety of skill levels to battle. I can see this getting to the table a lot in 2025. This was my No.1 by a mile!

What games am I looking forward to in 2025? I’ve just acquired Rock Hard 1977, this looks amazing, I hope it plays as good, Black Forest has me interested and could be my first purchase of 2025. Then I have lots of expected kickstarter’s, highlights being, The Old Kings Crown, Yonder and World Order. Here’s to 2025, Happy New Year and happy gaming!

Live mangrove in Walstad tank?,walstad,1hq0tw0,2024-12-30 18:32:26,4,0.84,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/walstad/comments/1hq0tw0/live_mangrove_in_walstad_tank/,garbfoobar,,"Anyone have experience with live red mangrove in a Walstad-style tank?

  
I first planned to try it out in a \~5 L jar, but got bitten by the tank bug and got a used 105 L tank (IN ADDITION to the jar, ofc -.-). My initial idea was to focus solely on the mangroves, but it has evolved slightly and what I currently have in mind is a tank planted densely with low-ish plants (dwarf hairgrass, marsilea hirsuta, ..), ""a few"" (3-5?!) mangroves, amano shrimp and a school of smaller fish such as phoenix raspbora.

To accommodate the mangroves my idea would be to have a slightly thicker layer of soil, \~5-10 cm / 2-4 inch, and cover with \~2.5 cm / 1 inch of 2-4 mm gravel. I plan on using organic potting soil mixed with \~10% clay from the garden and 10% sand from a nearby sandbox to get some more minerals and something slightly more like the natural habitat. When it comes to the potting soil, I got some marketed as peat-free where the peat has been replaced by residual products from forestry and paper industry. It has a very strange, oily smell so I think I'll skip that in the large tank and go for the ordinary peat moss-based ones instead... Could try it out in the jar though :)

The rough plan is to set the tank up with the ""ordinary"" plants first, let it settle and then pop in mangrove propagules. What I understand they can be kept above the substrate to let it reach down with the roots over time, perhaps even raising them as they grow to get more visible roots above the substrate. One idea is to put a few of them in a tighter cluster and see what it can evolve into!

Any thoughts? I'm a bit hesitant to the thick layer of soil - would it be wiser to have the ordinary 1 inch/2.5 cm layers and use clay pots to give the mangroves some depth?!

Game crashes in the middle of battle,MB2Bannerlord,1hp7ora,2024-12-29 17:27:05,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MB2Bannerlord/comments/1hp7ora/game_crashes_in_the_middle_of_battle/,ChaouiZ,Game Bug,"I keep running into a crash in the middle of a battle. I saved just before the battle, and I get the same exception every time. I'll have the exception, stack trace, and mods installed below. 

Details: This exception has only occurred in this particular battle, and only during a particular scenario. I have built a party of cavalry and horse archers. I have been playing with the tactic of holding down enemy infantry and archers with cavalry until I can get my horse archers in place, then pulling cavalry back and letting the stationary horse archers rain arrows from multiple directions. 

This crash only occurs once I have got the horse archers into place, while they are firing into a block of infantry. I have done this plenty of times with no issues by this point, but this is the biggest battle I have done this in ( my \~100 horse archers vs \~200 infantry and \~100 archers) 

  
I'd appreciate any help fixing this issue.

Also when I went to fix the robots the two legged one was missing even tho it was there when I originally started the quest and when I went to see everyone missing it was walking around. 

I've went there before and they were all there.

Figuring out which wood to use for a sandbox border. Is redwood (with its tannin content) safe for a kid's sandbox?,woodworking,1ho6xe4,2024-12-28 09:38:41,1,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1ho6xe4/figuring_out_which_wood_to_use_for_a_sandbox/,neutron_star_800,Help,"I am building a sandbox in my backyard. I am planning on digging a hole, filling it with sand, and then surrounding the hole with some kind of wood to form a border (the wood will be dug down into the dirt one or two inches). Where I live is pretty dry, and the low areas of my yards don't turn into ponds except for only an hour or so after the heaviest rains, so I'm not worried about my simple approach retaining water.

I was planning on using pressure-treated wood for the wood border, since that's what I had growing up, but am now reconsidering with some of the comments I've seen on this subreddit about the potential toxicity of even modern pressure-treated wood.

So I'm considering redwood now. But with its tannin content, would redwood actually be safer than ACQ-treated wood?

Any other suggestions of wood types to use?"

Today (December 26th) I am hosting a session zero to go over the campaign rules, do character creation, answer any questions about the campaign, and possibly do a short example of exploration and combat to give folks more of a feel for what to expect. So if you think you might be interested in playing in this campaign, today is an opportune time to figure that out.

**Details:**
- **Time:** Thursdays 1:00-5:00 PM EST (start and end times are negotiable)
- **Rules:** Old School Essentials (Classic and Advanced options, plus additions from Carcass Crawler), largely identical to B/X
- **Requirements:** Played over Discord voice chat, Discord account and working microphone required.
- **Other Stuff:** Beginner-friendly and LGBT-friendly.
- **Structure:** A survival hexcrawl sandbox.
- **Setting:** The Painted Wastelands, a pastel-colored desert dreamworld of talking skulls and demonic bats where drug-crazed raiders duel on shoddy jetbikes, inhuman sorcerers smoke ectoplasm in crowded markets, and desert weirdos collect promotional merch from their favorite alien holo-shows.
- **Starting Hook:** The characters find themselves trapped in a colorful wasteland after each falling afoul of a mysterious sorcerer. They must survive in the dreamlike desert and learn the ways of its inhabitants while they search for a way home. 

Please message me if you are interested in playing.

*Take courage, lost traveler! You have found yourself in the Painted Wastelands. You're stranded upon the ragged edge of the infinite worlds of dreaming, trapped in a space that probably makes little sense to neophytes such as yourself. Prepare your soul to enter a lucid land of sorcerers and endless sands.*

*Dive headfirst into a bizarre world teeming with desert weirdos, ravenous ghouls, and teeth-stealing dream-beasts. The land is a vibrant kaleidoscope of rainbow-colored sand and crumbling ruins.*

*Wander from place to place, skipping across Unreality like a stone tossed along the surface of a pool of ectoplasm. You'll encounter bizarre entities of the desert, sweaty pilgrims desperate for absolution, and strange sorcerers meditating in a haze of ectoplasmic smoke. You'll plumb the depths of ruins forgotten by untold millennia and hopefully survive the wrath of vengeful nightmares given life.* 

*Come, stranger. Cross the threshold - but beware! Have you seen the Tears of the Bleeding Eye?*"

I have the following problem to solve:

Given a sandbox containing 900 units of sand, calculate the probability of persons A and B finding an object buried within the sand. The object occupies one unit of sand.

Person A removes 1 unit of sand per second, starting from one side of the sandbox.  
Person B removes 3 units of sand per second, starting from the opposite side of the sandbox.

The total time available to search for the object is 120 seconds. Both individuals start searching simultaneously and compete to find the object first.

1 - What is the probability of each person finding the object before the other?  
2 - Recalculate the problem if person 2 were moving at 10 units per second."

I mailed them through my mailbox, not post office and did it plainly, as in I didn’t pay extra for quicker shipping or priority mail. Just used a stamp. I knew it wouldn’t arrive the fastest, but four weeks? Seriously? 
I realize it’s December and the post office slows down this time of year, but is this normal? Has anyone else had this problem?"
Can anyone make an ecosystem game? ,unrealengine,1hkyybw,2024-12-23 17:19:46,0,0.17,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/1hkyybw/can_anyone_make_an_ecosystem_game/,Resident_Future_22,Question,"Can anyone make an ecosystem game? Like you as the player can sandbox a map and create an ecosystem, where you can add animals, bugs, amphibians, reptiles and birds etc to an open map. you have an open map and you can add hills, water, foliage, etc. Sort of like Jurassic world evolution sand box but with all the advanced ai systems and animals, nesting, population, hunting etc. it would do so well on steam.

If you don’t follow the instructions on the respective nexus mod pages/githubs, it will not work!  remove mods mid-game at your peril.
I personally enjoy using the player switcher mod to quantum-leap into historical figures and RP as them!
Colomon of Hungary, Vlad Monomakh, and Boniak (the Cuman Maniac!) are very fun in this regard.
As always all credit to the amazing modding community that take a coatrack of a game and make it something incredible.

Are there any problems clearing the snow putting down some dry pavers and firing up my new 25KG furnace. Need to temper the crucibles and try to melt some scrap Al.

I would think dropping a hot crucible on snow would be a problem ....... well dropping a crucible at anytime is not good....... any other thoughts?



I built a sandbox using a plastic pickup truck tool box and 2"" X 6""s to support it. It is filled with perfect clay sand. It is in an unheated shed.

Is there any way to keep it from freezing without heating the whole shed? I am considering burring a silicone 55 gallon drum heater in the sand.

Tips and Advice,hamster,1hjzspv,2024-12-22 09:44:01,11,0.87,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hamster/comments/1hjzspv/tips_and_advice/,Antilogicz,,"I’ve owned 6 hamsters (only ever one at a time) over the course of my life. They all lived to life expectancy and died peacefully with no serious injuries or incidents. My childhood hamster (in the 90s) was miserable and I made all the classic mistakes like we all have. Here is what I have learned:

1.Get the biggest enclosure you possibly can. The bigger the better. And I do mean big. If you don’t have the space, don’t get a hamster, because they will be stressed and so will you.

This one (below) is good for a dwarf hamster, but you should get two of them and squish them together (remove the plexiglass in the middle) and make it twice as big for a Syrian:

GDLF Hamster Cage with Storage Cabinet Small Animal Cage, Easy View Acrylic Panels, Large Habitat for Hedgehog Gerbil & Rat 39.5”x19.7”x43.7” https://a.co/d/adWzh9N

I made mine a cardboard platform on stilts so it was a double decker with twice as much floor space. You sort of have to get creative.

2.Offer all the food in the world in massive quantities. Food is a delight. It’s a joy in life. Hamsters don’t want pellets. They want seeds, nuts, dried fruits, dried flowers, etc. Use several hamster food mixes together and buy your own additional ingredients from the store. Seed mixes to put on baked breads can be amazing for hamsters or crushed nuts for baking cakes. Just double, triple check the ingredients.

Also be sure to offer fresh food daily from your hand. Maybe a small piece of a green bean or a nibble of banana, for example. If I’m eating broccoli, I will offer a very small portion of mine to my hamster. The important thing is to make sure that you hold it firm and only let them eat as much as they feel like in the moment. Then, remove it. Don’t let them drag it away, because it can rot in the enclosure and make them sick.

Offer them 3 times the amount of food they could ever eat and then some. Your hamster will not get fat, I promise. Hamsters don’t really get fat, this is such a myth, and even if they are fat—it’s not that bad for their health. And normally, only hamsters with super small enclosures, small wheels, and poor mental health will get fat. Diabetes is more genetic than food-based. I wish more people understood this. Hamsters look fat, because all the hamsters you see at pet stores and online are seriously malnourished or baby hamsters. Adult hamsters look chunky—but that’s just how they are.

Hamsters are gatherers. They hoard food. That means they will store food, but only eat as much of it as they feel like. It’s essential that you give them things to gather. They will burn calories by gathering. They will get bored, depressed, and possibly fat—if you don’t let them gather. It’s sort of the main thing they like to do. They gather food and store it. Please don’t deprive them of this natural behavior because you don’t trust them to portion their own food intake. They can. It’s not up for you to decide how much food they eat. Let them have some autonomy on that and trust them to handle it themselves.

My last hamsters favorite foods were flaxseed and peas. I offered her tons of high sugar junk (yogurt drops, banana, etc.) and she literally hated most of those. I had to stop buying yogurt drops because she wouldn’t even gather them. And I bought them in 4 different flavors. Your hamster can decide what they want to eat for themselves. If your hamster is eating tons of sugary crap—it’s probably because they feel food insecure. Give your hamster the gift of good mental health and allow them to eat whatever they want in whatever quantity. They deserve at least that much freedom, if we’re keeping them enslaved in a box for our own amusement.

Hamsters aren’t dogs and cats. I have to monitor my dog’s and cat’s food or they will absolutely get fat. But hamsters are gatherers and they just don’t work the way dogs and cats do. They are completely different creatures.

3.Offer them two different wheels in the enclosure. Never the flying saucers (those are dangerous). The reality is that different wheels can function and feel different. Offering two different ones gives them more options. But also, don’t be surprised if your hamster doesn’t use their wheel.

My hamsters almost never use their wheel, because they have better stuff to do (like gather food and make burrows). If you give them a big enough enclosure and enough stuff to entertain themselves with (again lots of scattered foods, seed sprays, treat sticks, dried flowers and herbs, ripped up unscented toilet paper, at least 15 inches of soft paper bedding or more, a very large sand pit, echo-earth to dig in, multiple hides, etc.) they’ll be so busy with that stuff that they won’t use the wheel very much.

4.Buy a plastic, cafeteria food tray from Amazon for $6 to put sand in. It makes for the best sand pit. Just please make sure it’s on stilts if it’s placed on top of bedding. All heavy items should be on stilts, so hamsters don’t burrow underneath and squish themselves if the burrow collapses.

Repti-sand is fine. Or you could use dry, sterilized sandbox sand from your local hardware store. If you’re ever uncertain, just make sure it has no added calcium or colored dyes and cook it on a cookie sheet in the oven for a while until it’s really hot. Then, let it cool completely before giving it to your hamster.

5.Never demand affection from your hamster. Just leave them alone. Some want to hangout, some don’t. Just let them chill. Read their body language. If they are wide eyed and shaking (or abnormally still, or frantically trying to keep moving around) when you pick them up, then please put them back down. Never wake them up. Never grab them. Never force them from their hiding spots. Always let them climb into your hand for food and pick them up slightly if they are okay with that. Hamsters are aesthetic pets. They don’t want to cuddle. And you just gotta deal with that, because they are their own little people. So just let them be. You’ll find they are more generous with their trust if you don’t abuse it.

6.Always, Always, Always get your hamster second-hand. Look at local shelters, rescues, or people online. There is ALWAYS someone online trying to rehome a hamster. You will always have options. If you’re in an area that sells hamsters, someone is trying to get rid of one.

You are not “saving” a hamster from a pet store. You are BUYING a PRODUCT that will need to be REPLACED. So they will breed more in horrible conditions. As sad as it is, you must LEAVE THOSE HAMSTERS THERE.  Unless you steal them from the store in the dead of night, you’re just letting them profit. And even if you did steal them, the store would still just replace them. So you cannot win.

You MUST help to pass legislation to make selling hamsters illegal. Petition, call your local government leaders, get involved. But don’t be a shopper and part of the problem.

Always get your hamster second-hand if you care about ending hamster cruelty.

7.Never, never, never put two hamsters together. Not even dwarf hamsters. Don’t do it. Never introduce your hamster to other animals in your home (they don’t want to hangout—trust me).

Dwarf hamsters look like they are cuddling, but they aren’t. They are establishing dominance which could easily turn into a fight to the death. Which can happen suddenly at any time, even if it’s never happened before. Grooming each other is also a dominance behavior. Trust me, they are stressed out and don’t like each other. Always keep your hamster solitary. They will not get lonely. They aren’t social creatures like we are. Hamsters like privacy.

Hope this helps.


Edit: Also, give them whimzees dog treats. Chop them into smaller bits. Or get the smallest ones and snap them in half with your hands. Hamsters are omnivores.

Edit#2: Also, always offer a water bowl and bottle. Both have their upsides and this way your hamster will always have access to water, even if the water bottle gets an air bubble and stops dispensing water. Change water daily (water gets stale). If you do it everyday, then becomes a daily habit so you don’t forget. Clean the water bowl and bottle with hot water and soap once a week."

* **Projections for Gaming Coins in the Next Bull Run:**
   * **Key Trends to Watch:**
* 1.Massive Growth in Web3 Gaming: Games that blend Web2 and Web3 seamlessly (e.g., \*My Pet Hooligan\*) could drive mainstream adoption. Also, gaming tokens tied to playable, engaging games will likely outperform speculative coins.
* 2.Metaverse Re-Emergence: If the metaverse narrative gains traction again, coins like SAND and MANA could benefit significantly.
* 3.NFT Integration: Coins with utility tied to NFTs or digital assets in games (e.g., Karrat) will likely see increased demand.

https://preview.redd.it/bp7mhlv94p7e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fef3a4641c2550f522aa10c7d76cb35720cc6e

**-Top Gaming Coin Projections:**

**-| Coin  --------- | Speculative Peak Price  --------- | Market Cap Implication |**

**-|---------------------------------------------------------------------|**

* \-| **AXS**  \-----------| $50–$80  --------------------| $5–8 billion |
* \-| **SAND** \---------- | $5–$10  --------------------- | $7–14 billion |
* \-| **GALA**  \----------| $0.50–$1.00  -----------------| $10–15 billion |
* \-| **MANA**  \----------| $3–$6  ----------------------| $6–12 billion |
* \-| **ENJ**    \-----------| $3–$6  ---------------------  | $3–6 billion |

# New:  Example of what to project for the next bull run. How a new gaming crypto Karrat Might Compare. There are many new coins in the gaming ecosystem!

# If Karrat follows similar growth trajectories:

* \-	Current Price: \~$0.50.
* \-	Speculative Peak Price: $10–$30.
* \-	Market Cap Implication: $3–9 billion (assuming \~300M circulating supply by 2025).

Karrat’s growth potential depends heavily on the success of \*My Pet Hooligan\* and the adoption of AMGI’s broader ecosystem, including Studio Chain and NFT integration.

https://preview.redd.it/bp7mhlv94p7e1.jpg?width=2868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64fef3a4641c2550f522aa10c7d76cb35720cc6e

# Conclusion:

Gaming tokens in the next bull run could experience significant growth, but their performance will hinge on real utility, adoption, and timing. Coins tied to strong gaming ecosystems or major narratives (like NFTs and metaverse) are positioned to outperform speculative projects. If history repeats or rhymes, coins like Karrat and others in the gaming sector could see explosive growth, particularly during the final stages of the bull market. 🚀

Nifty Or Thrifty: Little Holiday Cup,TheSilphRoad,1hgiysq,2024-12-17 14:43:23,85,0.9,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1hgiysq/nifty_or_thrifty_little_holiday_cup/,JRE47,Analysis,"The ""Nifty Or Thrifty"" article series takes a comprehensive look at the meta for PvP Cup formats: [**Holiday Cup** in Little League](https://i.imgur.com/wigfens.png), in this case. As is typical for the NoT series, I'll cover not only the top meta picks, but also some mons where you can save some dust with cheaper second move unlock costs or using as little XL Candy as possible. Because for those on a stardust budget — and/or folks trying to save up some dust for the future — it can be daunting trying to figure out where to spend or not spend it. We all want to field competitive teams, but where can we get the best bang for our buck and where should we perhaps channel our inner scrooge?

A quick reminder of what Holiday Cup (Little League Edition) is:

- Little League, 500 CP Limit.

- Only **Electric, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ice,** and **Normal** type Pokémon are allowed.

As I try to usually do, I will start with those with the cheapest second move unlock cost and steam ahead until we finally arrive at the expensive Legendaries. Although in this meta, there is one thing I need to get out of the way first....

~~The possibilities are literally endless. People have done all kinds of crazy things to get some insane movesets on their Smeargles, as you can take a photo of something with Frustration and get almost any move in the game in that same move slot with the resulting, photobombing Smeargle. The one a lot of people seem to talk about for THIS meta is [**Incinerate/Flying Press**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/42-52-0/2-1),  and while that is indeed terrifying, you know what? Smeargle can get [even](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/47-52-0/2-1) [scarier](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/42-34-0/2-1). [MUCH](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/70-130-0/2-1) scarier. And [some combinations](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/47-125-0/2-1) don't even require Frustration hijinks... that last one can be had by photobombing the right Regirock, for example. The only thing that will keep it from completely taking over this Cup is that it has to be maxed out to approach 500 CP, and many cannot do that.~~

~~I'll be sure to highlight things that generally handle Smeargle as we go, for the majority of us that don't have one but want to be able to enjoy this meta anyway. Here we go with the rest of the review!~~

So Smeargle is banned... huzzah! Pleased to say you can just ignore anything about it from here on out.


## **10,000 Dust/25 Candy**

**PIKACHU LIBRE**

*Thunder Shock | Flying Press & Thunder Punch*

The fact that [it is SO good here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre/11/1-1-3/2-1) shouldn't be... well, *shocking*. (Yesssss... your groans only make me stronger!) **Flying Press** remains a completely broken move (only 40 energy for 90 damage with *no drawbacks*) that is only kept in check by the fact that hardly anything has it... just Hawlucha, potentially Smeargle (more on that menace later), and ol' reward-for-reaching-Legend Libre. But as if that wasn't good enough, Libre just had **Thunder Shock** *and* **Thunder Punch** buffed  too. Not only does it do all the stuff you'd expect of an Electric type (beating every Water type and nearly every Flying type in the Cup), but it also smacks around a ton of Fighting-weak Ice, Normal, and/or Rock types... you know, a massive chunk of the meta. Throw in bonus wins over the big Fire types and stuff like Annihilape, and *dang*, this is a good target for trades before the Cup arrives, don't you think? The good news is that you can rather easily get it at 500 CP or less in a trade, and even with ""bad"" IVs, [it performs about the same](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre-20-10-10-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-1-3/2-1). (Even with [REALLY bad IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre-20-14-8-8-4-4-1-1/11/1-1-3/2-1)!)

Still don't have one? There are other Pikachus you can use, though none reach quite that same level. [**ROCK STAR**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_rock_star/11/1-3-1/2-1) comes the closest, though it misses out on big things that Flying Press is needed to beat, like Abomasnow, Diggersby, Alolan Vulpix, and Amaura and Aurorus. And that's where Libre's advantages mostly lie: beating Ice and Normal and Rock types that Fighting damage *should* beat, as well as many opposing Electric types. Rock Star's **Meteor Mash** *does* have its own advantages though, allowing Rock Star to overcome most Ghosts and even most otherwise deadly Ground types, as well as, interestingly, a bunch of Grass types too. It has a bit more merit than those core meta sims would imply, with less than 10 wins separating it and Libre when you consider the entire 500+ Pokémon format.

""**FLYING**"" Pikachu (there are several variants, but any of the ones with **Fly** as a charge attack count) is [another interesting one here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_flying/11/1-4-2/2-1), particularly if it has [high rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_flying-21-1-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/1-4-2/2-1) which adds on stuff like Annihilape, Shadow A-Wak, and sometimes Smeargle to a winlist that already includes stuff not even Libre can beat, like Joltik, Litwick, and Grasses like Chikorita. But uh... you still lose things that Flying Press annihilates like Amaura/Aurorus, Aboma, Diggersby, Alolan Vulpix/Ninetales and such.

Things do fall off a bit after that, though. [Regular Pikachu](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu-21-1-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/2-5-2/2-1) wants good IVs AND Legacy **Surf**, and still comes in mostly behind the others. It can work, but it's more of an uphill battle and at that point you're probably best off looking elsewhere. Like to big bro [**RAICHU**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/raichu/11/2-1-4/2-1), perhaps! At least it can also dish out some Fighting damage with **Brick Break**. Call it a poor man's Libre.

**FLETCHLING**

*Quick Attack | Fly & Swift*

Fun fact: Fletchling is NOT a Fire type like its two evolutions. It's a Normal Birb, so both **Quick Attack** and the recently buffed **Swift** actually get STAB damage! It's actually [the best Flying type in this format](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/fletchling) *period* by a pretty wide margin... after all, most Flyers struggle with all the Pikachus I just talked about! Fletchling struggles there too obviously, but what it DOES do that otherr Flyers cannot is beat things like CharmTales, Skeledirge, Mandibuzz, Miltank, Diggersby, and Alolan Marowak that should appear frequently. It's a very nice option in this format.

**TALONFLAME**

*Incinerateᴸ | Fly & Flame Charge*

While it's ranked much lower, [Talonflame is actually a close competitor to its pre-evolution](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/talonflame/11/1-4-3/2-1). Being a Fire type with good Fire damage *does* have its advantages, such as taking out Joltik, Litwick, Alolan Sandslash, and Abomasnow that non-Fire Flyers (like Fletchling) can't really replicate. Realistically the bulk of the damage is going to be done with **Incinerate**, as Talonflame lacks the bulk to reach many charge moves, but **Fly** and **Flame Charge** offer the best overall coverage and affordable cost... the rest are kind of overkill anyway.

**CHARIZARD**

*Fire Spin | Dragon Claw & Blast Burnᴸ*

ALL that said, here comes a bit of a shock: [Charizard might actually be the best of all](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/talonflame/11/1-4-3/2-1). As with most Flyers other than Fletchling, it does generally lose to Miltank, Diggersby, and Mandibuzz, but it beats *everything* Talonflame can plus Skeledirge, Alolan Vulpix, Shadow Alolan Marowak, and Talon itself in the head to head, thanks in very large part to **Dragon Claw**, which is a much better weapon in this low HP League than it usually is elsewhere. And **Fire Spin** was also buffed in Season 20 with a bit more damage. Zard is pretty gnarly in this meta, folks! I don't recommend [ShadowZard](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/charizard-shadow/11/3-1-2/2-1) *quite* as much (it struggles with Litwick and does even worse than others versus Smeargle), but it's certainly viable too.

**SKELEDIRGE**

*Incinerate | Disarming Voice & Shadow Ball*

[It's pretty great in this meta](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/skeledirge/11/1-4-2/2-1), doing big Fire things while also handling (most) other Fires thanks to **Shadow Ball**, stuff like Annihilape thanks to **Disarming Voice**, and occasional bonuses like Aurorus too. I like its versatility, though spoiler alert: Alolan Marowak that we cover later is generally a bit better all-around.

**PYROAR & LITLEO**

*Incinerate | Flame Charge & Dark Pulse/Crunch*

[Pyroar](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pyroar/11/2-1-2/2-1) and [Litleo](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litleo/11/2-3-1/2-1) also bring the heat with **Incinerate**, which is just nasty in HP-capped Little League. Pyroar's **Dark Pulse** is better at picking off Skeledirge (and Ghosts in general), but that's about all that separates the pair. One big downside: while the Ghostly and Flying Fire types above can all handle the otherwise scary Incinerate/Flying Press Smeargle, Pyroar and Litleo — being part Normal and thus weak to Flying Press — don't survive. As this is very quietly but very importantly one of the top roles for Fire types in this meta, not handling Flying Press Smeargle is a notable knock against this otherwise powerful pair.

**BIBAREL**

*Rollout | Surf & Hyper Fang*

What better way to extinguish those Fires than with some Water? Conveniently, Bibarel's new **Rollout** smashes Fire types too, as well as bringing in utility versus all the Ice and Flying types in this meta. [Put it all together](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/bibarel/11/0-3-2/2-1), and I would say that Bib is criminally underrated going into Little Holiday Cup, nearly ranking outside the Top 100. [Shadow Bibarel](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/bibarel-shadow/11/0-3-2/2-1) is just as good too, picking up Mandibuzz in 1- and 2shield, Diggersby with shields down, and Alolan Sandslash in 2shield, while trading away only Joltik in 0shield and Miltank in 1shield among things in the core meta. Either way, if you have a good one, this is a GREAT place to use it as one of the very best thrifty options, dirt cheap to build even right now from the ground up.

**DIGGERSBY**

*Quick Attack | Fire Punch & Scorching Sands*

[Particularly with high rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/diggersby-13-2-14-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-5-3/2-1) (which gains things like Libre in 1shield, Alolan Vulpix in 0shield, and Skeledirge in 2shield as compared to [more average IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/diggersby/11/1-5-3/2-1)), Diggs is a pretty good half-Normal in this meta too, holding down most major Fire and Electric types (as you would expect), plus things CharmTales and Miltank as bonuses. Its mixed moveset makes it threatening to nearly everything in the meta, though most Ice and Grass types can maneuver around **Fire Punch** long enough to escape with a win. They don't feel too good when it's over, though! 🔥

**OBSTAGOON**

*Counter | Night Slash & Cross Chop*

It's obviously diminished with the nerf to **Counter**, but there's not much here that has a full Fighting moveset, so yes, [Goonie is still good enough](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/obstagoon-7-10-15-10-4-4-1-1/11/0-4-1/2-1). Its role is clear: beat up on (most) Ice and Normal types, and little else, though wins over Stunfisk and some Ghosts like Shadow Litwick are nice bonuses.

**SENTRET**

*Quick Attack | Brick Break & Dig*

For another Normal type with Fighting damage, PvPoke recommends DUBWOOL with Double Kick. However, [I'm not overly impressed](). Instead, I'm actually going to recommend rolling with [Sentret and its **Brick Break**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sentret/11/0-1-2/2-1). While Dubwool can take down A-Slash and Sentret cannot, look at all that Sentret CAN beat that Dubwool struggles with: Amaura, Abomasnow, A-Vulpix, Stunfisk, Litwick and more. That said, Dubwool IS rather beastly [if it gets a Wild Charge around shields](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/dubwool/00/0-3-1/2-1) (while Sentret is [more pedestrian](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sentret/00/0-1-2/2-1) in 0shield), so this might come down to playstyle and team composition. But I like little Sentret quite a bit here, and heck, when else are you going to have a chance to use it? Go have some fun... after all, it's a *game*, right?

**ELEKID**

*Thunder Shock | Brick Break & Thunder Punch*

Speaking of **Brick Break**, [check out Elekid](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/elekid/11/1-1-4/2-1)! With that and the buffed **Thunder Shock** and **Thunder Punch**, it's an amazingly scrappy little guy in this meta. And yes, you MAY actually have one lying around at 500 CP or less; while it's never been in the wild and the vast majority have come only via hatching (which is way too high level), past special research during the Instinctive Hero event in May 2023, and again during the Triumph Together event just this past August. Check and see if you have an unexpected treasure in your collection! It handles all the stuff you'd expect of an Electric type AND a ton of Fighting-weak Ice, Normal, and/or Rock types, and conveniently most of the big Fire types too!

**LEAVANNY**

*Shadow Clawᴸ | Leaf Blade & X-Scissor*

There's a good chance you didn't bother building a Little League Leavanny during its Community Day. But [*if you did*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/leavanny/11/2-1-4/2-1).... And if not, you can build one during the December Community Day rehash and at least run it for the second week of Little Holiday Cup when it comes back on December 31st.

**COTTONEE**

*Charm/Razor Leaf | Seed Bomb & Grass Knot*

Listen, Uncle JRE is going to be straight with you: [Cottonee is not very good here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/cottonee-30.5-0-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-2-3/2-1). But I *also* recognize the reality that a ton of people run it in any all eligible Little League formats, so you WILL see it. Count on that, and just be careful not to get your Electric or Ground or Fighting or Dragon or Dark type locked in against a Cottonee in the back.

**JIGGLYPUFF**

*Feint Attack | Swift & Disarming Voice*

For mostly the same reasons as Cottonee, [WIGGLYTUFF is also lackluster here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/wigglytuff/11/0-7-5/2-1), but [*Jiggly*puff could be a surprising star](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/jigglypuff/11/0-6-3/2-1). **Disarming Voice** is plenty of Fairy damage in this HP-capped meta, and **Swift** is obviously pretty great now too. **Feint Attack** is *not* all that great, but at least it can reach those charge moves much faster than Charm, and the combination of those moves and that intriguing, Ghost-resistant Normal/Fairy typing makes Jiggly dangerous to a surprising number of things in Little Holiday Cup. [**IGGLYBUFF**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/igglybuff/11/0-4-3/2-1) is a slightly different flavor that works nicely too, but is MUCH more expensive to build.

**ALTARIA**

*Dragon Breath | Sky Attack & Moonblastᴸ*

I know people have build Little League Altarias in the past, but they've been relegated to the dust bin for quite a while now. [This MAY be the time to try it out again](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/altaria-9.5-3-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-4-3/2-1) as a decent generalist that also happens to beat the terrifying Incinerate Smeargle (even with the dreaded Flying Press too!)... but one which MUST avoid Ice. Nearly its entire core meta loss list is Ice types (and/or Fairies). Bring it in at the right moment and it still has enough left in the tank to dominate one more time.


## **50,000 Dust/50 Candy**

**ALOLAN MAROWAK**

*Fire Spin | Bone Club & Shadow Boneᴸ/Shadow Ball*

Ranked all the way up at [#3 in Little Holiday Cup](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/marowak_alolan_shadow) (*and* [also #4](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/marowak_alolan)!), and you know what? [I see little reason to argue with that](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/marowak_alolan-shadow/11/0-1-5/2-1). The majorly buffed **Bone Club** (with support from **Shadow Bone**, or **Shadow Ball** in a pinch) buries opposing Fire types, **Fire Spin** burns through Ice and Grass types and stuff like Joltik, and the combination takes down notable Normals like Miltank, Diggersby, and yes, most iterations of Smeargle that you can expect to see as well (like the Incinerate/Flying Press gold standard), without needing resisted Shadow Bone/Ball at all. That's all for the Shadow version, at least... notable that [non-Shadow A-Wak](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/marowak_alolan/11/0-1-5/2-1) lags a bit behind by losing to things like Joltik, Diggersby, and Talonflame. There is very little reason NOT to run A-Wak if you have one at the ready! ☠️

**ALOLAN SANDSLASH**

*Powder Snow | Ice Punch & Drill Run*

With the buff to **Ice Punch**, [A-Slash](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandslash_alolan/11/1-6-4/2-1) more clearly gets the nod over [ALOLAN SANDSHREW](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandshrew_alolan/11/1-3-1/2-1) now more than ever. And yes, you can build it without Legacy **Shadow Claw**... with the number of Ghost-resistant Normal types around, **Powder Snow** is generally better in this meta anyway, with wins Claw cannot match like Mandibuzz, Diggerby, and Miltank. Shadow A-Slash is very similar but perhaps slightly better, with no major differences in 1shield, an extra win over Diggersby with shields down, and most impressively, added wins versus Stunfisk, Libre, Shadow A-Vulpix, *and* Amaura [in 2v2 shielding](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandslash_alolan-shadow/22/1-6-4/2-1). 

**ALOLAN NINETALES**

*Charm/Powder Snow | Weather Ball (Ice) & Psyshock*

For **Charm**Tales, [Shadow is better](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan-shadow/11/0-5-4/2-1), with extra wins [non-Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan/11/0-5-4/2-1) cannot match like Libre, Miltank, and Amaura. If you insist, though, you CAN run [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan-shadow/11/2-5-4/2-1) and also do pretty well as a Shadow, trading away things like Libre and CharmTales itself to instead beat stuff like Stunfisk and Diggersby. Which suits YOUR team better, dear reader?

**ALOLAN VULPIX** is, honestly, [rather disappointing](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/vulpix_alolan-23-0-15-14-4-4-1-1-shadow/11/0-2-5/2-1), however. You certainly *can* run it, but I'm having a hard time thinking of what it can do that other Ice options aren't just better at....

**SNORUNT**

*Powder Snow | Icy Wind & Shadow Ball*

One base evolutionary Ice that *does* work well is little chilly Snorunt. **Powder Snow** and **Icy Wind** are a good start, and then **Shadow Ball**pushes things over the edge with wins over several Ice types (Amaura and Alolan Sandslash, Ninetales, and Vulpix). [High rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/snorunt-23-0-15-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-4-2/2-1) bring in Joltik and Abomasnow too. Neat!

**SPHEAL/SEALEO**

*Water Gun | Body Slam & Water Pulse*

As we somewhat saw with Bibarel, Water damage can be powerful in this meta, so yes, Spheal and Sealeo seem best not with the standard **Powder Snow**, but humble **Water Gun** instead, rolling from there into widely neutral **Body Slam** and MORE Water damage with **Water Pulse**. Spheal has slightly more bulk and [a slightly better record](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spheal/11/1-2-3/2-1) (+ Amaura), but [Sealeo works just fine too](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sealeo/11/1-2-3/2-1)... you can play whichever one you have ready for Little League and barely notice a difference. And if you just can't bear the thought of having NO Ice coverage, sure, you can run [Aurora Beam](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spheal/11/1-2-1/2-1), but it *is* slightly worse overall and doesn't gain you what you'd think... it's just not a very good move.

**WALREIN**

*Waterfall/Powder Snowᴸ | Icicle Spearᴸ & Water Pulse/Earthquake*

Well similar to Water Gun above, it's finally arrived: the meta where [**Waterfall** Walrein](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein-shadow/11/2-3-2/2-1) is legit! Yes, [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein/11/1-4-3/2-1) is still fine too (for non-Shadow Wally, at least), as long as you still tote around Water damage output via **Water Pulse**. But as you can tell by going even to the extreme of [eliminating Ice damage *entirely*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein/11/2-2-4/2-1) — normally an insane idea when you consider how good Powder Snow and **Icicle Spear** are — Water damage is really good here. I feel like I said that already? Anyway, I'd probably still try and [keep Spear in the mix](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein-shadow/11/2-3-4/2-1) somewhere, but it's nice to have options... and the option to build Wally for this meta without needing ANY Legacy moves at all if you want to.

I also recommend running contrary to the normal [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/abomasnow-shadow/11/1-2-5/2-1) and instead using [**Leafage**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/abomasnow-shadow/11/0-4-5/2-1) if you run **ABOMASNOW**, just because it makes it quite unique here and gives it a niche... but honestly, I'm having trouble recommending Aboma at all. You can expect to see it here, though... similar to stuff like Cottonee, while it may not be highly recommended in this meta, it's a staple in Little League already that people WILL pull off the shelf.

Similarly, I normally DO recommend **SWINUB** in Little League, but [it's a bit worse than I hoped to see](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/swinub/11/0-4-2/2-1) in this particular meta. I think it has enough niche use to consider over Aboma, at least, but it probably requires some thoughful team composition to be as useful as it normally seems to be in formats like this.

**JOLTIK**

*Sucker Punch | Cross Poison & Bug Buzz/Discharge*

A bit of a weird one, as Joltik operates much more as a Swiss Army knife than its more straightforward big bro Galvantula. **Sucker Punch** and **Cross Poison** make this little guy truly unique in this meta, threatening and beating many Ghosts (even ones scary for Bugs like A-Wak and Skeledirge) as well as relevant Fairies like Alolan Ninetales and Grasses like Hisuian Electrode, and by resisting all of its moves, Pikachu Libre as a very nice bonus. Then it's just decision time on the closer: [**Discharge**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/joltik-19.5-0-15-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-2-3/2-1) to try and blow away stuff like Talonflame, Litwick, and Aurorus, or [**Bug Buzz**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/joltik-19.5-0-15-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-2-1/2-1) to add on things like Stunfisk and Diggersby?

**HISUIAN ELECTRODE**

*Thunder Shock | Swift & Wild Charge*

As I just mentioned it (I think for the first time?), yeah, let's highlight [how good H-Trode is here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/electrode_hisuian/11/1-2-3/2-1). The buff to **Swift** (and **Thunder Shock**) is huge, giving it a ton of wins it could never achieve with pre-move-buff stats like Amaura and Aurorus (thanks to better baiting), Alolan Ninetales (and Vulpix), Abomasnow, Miltank, and Libre. And of course, it does the Electric job well, though its Grass type is just as much a curse (weakness to the Ice/Water types that most Electrics should pretty well dominate, for example) as it is a blessing (resisting Water, making Ground damage neutral). 

**TOGEDEMARU**

*Thunder Shock | Fell Stinger & Wild Charge*

Nothing fancy here, just capitalizing on the buffed **Thunder Shock** again. **Fell Stinger** bait-n-buffs are important to take out things like Pibre and Alolan Ninetales/Vulpix, but Toge is pretty well positioned in this meta anyway thanks to the OHKO that often comes with Wild Charge at this level, as well as the many helpful resistances (Ice, Rock, and Normal especially) that come with its Steel subtyping. The downside? Vulnerabilities to Fighting (Flying Press, anyone?) and Fire that will be omnipresent in Little Holiday Cup.

**TADBULB**

*Thunder Shock | Parabolic Charge & Discharge*

Ever less fancy here, as we're talking straight Electric typing and moves. But what Tad has that most other Electrics do not is bulk. it also has (again) buffed **Thunder Shock** leading into fine charge moves, and [that takes it a good long way](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/tadbulb/11/0-2-1/2-1). I don't know that I'd burn a lot of resources on one, but if you happen to have one close to 500 CP already, it could be fun here and is likely WAY off most peoples' radar.

**LANTURN**

*Water Gun | Surf & Thunderbolt*

And speaking of bulk... yes, [you can run Lanturn here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lanturn-9.5-0-10-12-4-4-1-1/11/2-4-2/2-1). It's diminished, but still just fine. Do focus on its wet side, though... **Water Gun** is probably the way to go here.

**DUCKLETT**

*Water Gun/Wing Attack | Aerial Ace & Bubble Beam/Brave Bird*

I know, the know... the mere mention of this one has some of you breaking out in hives. I am sorry to report that Ducklett may be primed to terrorize yet another Little League meta... but this time, [by showing its wet side](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ducklett/11/0-1-3/2-1). That's right... while you CAN still run [**Wing Attack**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ducklett/11/1-3-1/2-1) and do okay, the wins it gets that way (mostly Grasses like Aboma and Chikorita) seem to me to have far less value than what **Water Gun** can do (beating stuff like A-Slash, A-Pix, Aurorus, Amaura, and even Smeargle instead). The caveat is that some wins are at least partially reliant on **Bubble Beam**, things like CharmTales, Amaura, and Annihilape... but the other stuff above (yes, including Smeargle still) can be had just by spamming **Aerial Ace** with no bait games required. The Duck Of Doom WILL strike again, so be prepared.

**PELIPPER**

*Wing Attack | Weather Ball (Water) & Hurricane*

*Here*, however, things still work out best with **Wing Attack**, as there's plenty of good Water spam already with **Weather Ball**. Overall though, [it's a worse Ducklett](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pelipper/11/1-4-2/2-1), if I'm being perfectly honest. That may be just fine for some teams, though!

**FARFETCH'D**

*Fury Cutter | Leaf Blade & Aerial Ace*

And real quick while we're on birbs, Farfetch'd isn't a world beater, but [it does look like fun](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/farfetchd/11/2-3-1/2-1) in Little Holiday Cup, if you've always been itching to try it out. Just throwing the idea out there... and using it to transition to analyzing a few more Normal types! Now you know my secret. 🤫

**DUNSPARCE**

*Rollout | Drill Run & Rock Slide*

Yeah yeah yeah... it'll lose to stuff with Fighting damage (read as: Flying Press and maybe Annihilape). We got it. [That doesn't take away from all the good that Dundun can do](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/dunsparce/11/2-2-3/2-1)! 👀 Seriously, take Fighting stuff away and its entire core meta loss list is Rock-resistant Diggersby, the Shadow versions of A-Wak and CharmTales (no shame in either of those), and dedicated Grass type (and [unlikely to actually be used very much](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/chikorita/11/2-1-3/2-1)) Chikorita. That's it... that's the list, people. It destroys other Ice, Fire, Bug, Flying, Ghost, and even most Normal types. See if you have one ready... Dundun is a fantastic generalist here as long as you can avoid getting it locked in versus Fighting damage.

**LICKILICKY**

*Rollout | Body Slamᴸ & Shadow Ball/Earthquake*

Less impressive, but [still quite good](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickilicky/11/1-1-4/2-1). **Shadow Ball** has the speed and effectiveness to blast through Skeledirge, Amaura, and A-Slash, while [**Earthquake**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickilicky/11/1-1-2/2-1) instead buries Joltik, Stunfisk, and Miltank.

And no, **LICKITUNG** [isn't as good as you remember](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickitung/11/0-1-3/2-1), either. Sorrynotsorry... I hate that thing almost as much as Chansey. *shudder* (Good time to remind folks... [DO NOT RUN CHANSEY](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/chansey/11/0-4-2/2-1)!!)

**URSARING**

*Shadow Claw | Swift & Close Combat*

I don't have a lot to say here... [it just *works*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ursaring/11/2-4-1/2-1), with **Swift** being the final piece to finally make Ursaring PvP-relevant. **Shadow Claw** makes it a great Ghostbuster, it outlasts Libre, shreds Ice types with **Close Combat**, blows out Fire types as a bonus. It's solid, just flimsy. That's a bit of a paradox, ain't it? 🤔

**SPINDA**

*Sucker Punch | Icy Wind & Rock Tomb*

As it's only even been available in research (and raids), and thus needs to be traded to drop below 10-10-10 IVs, #1 rank IVs with 0 Attack is basically just theotetical, which is a shame because [it would be AMAZING here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spinda-16.5-0-12-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-2/2-1). As is, we probably have to ""settle"" for something [like this](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spinda-15.5-5-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-2/2-1), which misses out on only A-Slash and Amaura (and only sometimes!) and is still just fine. I like it... the buff to **Sucker Punch** has only made it more interesting, and it was always at least spicy in Little League. Might be more like full-on meta now!

**GIRAFARIG**

*Double Kick | Psychic Fangs & Trailblaze*

Geoffamafig ranked SUPER low... like outside the Top 250 kind of low. But that's because it's showing with Confusion... and you really want to be running [**Double Kick**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/girafarig-shadow/11/1-3-5/2-1) instead. And it can actually perform a bit *better* than even that shows, as **Psychic Fangs** alone can add on unlisted wins [Skeledirge](https://pvpoke.com/battle/sandbox/500/girafarig-9.5-4-11-4-4-4-1-1-shadow/skeledirge-6.5-4-4-11-4-4-1-1/22/1-3-0/1-4-2/10.100010-16.111100-20.100010) and [Stunfisk](https://pvpoke.com/battle/500/girafarig-9.5-4-11-4-4-4-1-1-shadow/stunfisk-8.5-10-14-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-0/1-3-1) too! Look at how my boy Farigamarif has grown! Brings a tear to my eye.

**ANNIHILAPE**

*Counter | Rage Fistᴸ & Close Combat*

Now we really CAN call it ""Little"" Anni! 😁 Anyway, **Counter** may have been nerfed, but it's still [more than good enough in Little League](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-6-0-12-14-4-4-1-1/11/0-5-1/2-1), pummeling a ton of Ice, Rock, and Normal types (including [FP Smeargle](https://pvpoke.com/battle/500/annihilape-6-0-12-14-4-4-1-1/smeargle-50-15-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-5-1/42-52-0) and stuff like Litwick too thanks to **Rage Fist**, which is the only charge move you even need 99% of the time. This is particularly true of [Shadow Anni](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-shadow/11/0-5-0/2-1), which actually beats stuff like PowderTales and Chikorita only if it does NOT reach for something like [**Close Combat**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-shadow/11/0-5-1/2-1) and sticks with strictly Rage Fist instead. But yeah... in a meta where most other Fighters aren't allowed in, Annihilape gets to roam free and sow some terror.

**DUSKULL**

*Astonish | Night Shade & Returnᴸ/Ominous Wind*

Remember how Dusclops used to only ever be viable in Limited metas if purified to get **Return** as a non-Ghost beatstick closing move? [That's Duskull now](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/duskull/11/0-3-1/2-1), as it needs a non-Ghost move like Return to beat things like Miltank. Anyway, if you run Shadow, [substitute with **Ominous Wind**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/duskull-shadow/11/0-2-1/2-1), I guess, to at least have a shot at the self-buff. For what it's worth, while purified Duskie can outlast Miltank and Chikorita and Amaura, Shadow beats down Talonflame and A-Pix instead.

**HAUNTER**

*Shadow Claw | Ice Punch & Shadow Punch*

**Shadow Ball** is not only overkill in this meta, but also just too expensive. The improved **Shadow Punch** is plenty, and pairs very nicely with **Ice Punch** [for maximum destructive capability](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/haunter/11/2-2-4/2-1). Thanks in large part to Ice Punch, Haunter crosses off things Duskull (and indeed, most Ghosts in general) cannot like Diggersby, Mandibuzz, Abomasnow and the A-Pixes. On the downside, it lacks the bulk of Duskull and therefore loses to other Ghosts like A-Wak and Litwick, as well as Miltank and, despite resisting Fairy damage, CharmTales as well. But still, it does a lot of good in blindingly fast fashion. Somebody is gonna wreck face with Haunter, I am sure of it.

**LURANTIS**

*Fury Cutter | Leaf Blade & Superpower*

Finishing up this section with [a fun one](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lurantis/11/0-1-3/2-1) many may miss otherwise. Lurantis comes with some awesome moves, spamming **Leaf Blade** in a meta where not much resists it, and **Superpower** to turn the tables on most Ice types. Many Grasses struggle to make an impact in this meta, but when they do, as Lurantis does, the resistances to Electric and Ground come in handy with wins like Diggersby, Stunfisk, and Pikachu Libre. **FOMANTIS** works too, and though it lacks Superpower, it instead buffs itself with **Trailblaze** and therefore still has [much the same winlist](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/fomantis/11/0-3-4/2-1) anyway, missing out on PowderTales but gaining Joltik instead. I lean towards Lurantis but I gotta say, I didn't expect Fomantis to look *that* good.


## **75,000 Dust/75 Candy**

Alright, you know how this goes by now. Space is tight and TIME is tight, so we're going rapid fire for the more expensive picks. Most of them have been mentioned throughout anyway. Here we go!

- [**AMAURA**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/amaura/11/1-4-1/2-1) and [**AURORUS**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/aurorus/11/1-6-1/2-1) are both pretty great, smashing through most other Ices, Electrics, Ghosts, Flyers, Fires, Grounds and all the stuff in between. Mostly their only fear in this meta is things with Rollout, really good Ground moves (like A-Slash and its Drill Run), and Fighting damage. Beyond that, they have a LOT of room to romp.

- **MILTANK** is [nearly as theatening](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/miltank/11/0-1-3/2-1) as fellow **Rollout** spewing Dunsparce. Dundun wins the head to head and also adds on A-Slash, but **ice Beam** gives Millie some unique reach and it really comes down to which one you have on hand to use. Both are quite excellent in Little Holiday Cup.

- There's nothing particularly special about **EEVEE**, but [it's a fine generalist](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/eevee/11/0-2-4/2-1), especially if you have a costumed and/or shiny one to show off! And with the buff to Swift, you don't need to reach for any Legacy moves anymore either!

- Like the Ghost Of Christmas Past, [**VIGOROTH**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/vigoroth/11/0-1-2/2-1) could pop up again here to get you feeling nostalgic... or just angry. It probably wants **Brick Break** over **Rock Slide**, but otherwise it's mostly the same spammy creep you remember in THIS meta, at least.

- Everything I said earlier about Tadbulb and Electrics in general? [**PACHIRISU**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pachirisu/11/1-3-2/2-1) does all that too, and it's a hoot to use in Little League for the many of us that will likely NEVER get one maxed out for Great League use.

- **MAREEP** is surprisingly okay in this meta as well, particularly [as a Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/mareep-shadow/11/1-1-2/2-1). Absolutely nothing outstanding when you look at it, but **Thunder Shock** + **Body Slam** can still do good things in this League.

- Original Recipe **STUNFISK** doesn't like the cold of all the Ice types around, but [does plenty else really well](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/stunfisk/11/1-3-1/2-1). Fires and Flyers and Electrics especially want nothing to do with it.

- Man, you cannot let yourself get into battle with anything that slings Ice, but [**GLISCOR**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/gliscor-shadow/11/1-1-3/2-1) with new **Sand Attack** could do some nifty things in this meta for anyone brave (or crazy!) enough to try.

- Less crazy is the idea of running [**GOLETT**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/golett/11/1-3-1/2-1). **Mud Slap** to bury Fires and Electrics, **Shadow Punch** and **Brick Break** to strike back at Ghosts and Normals and even a number of Ice types, and a typing that resists Fighting damage and therefore takes down Annihilape and Flying Press users too. What's NOT to like? This is just a full-on meta pick here, folks.

- It's been namedropped a lot, and yes, **LITWICK** is quite good in [regular](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litwick/11/0-4-2/2-1) or [Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litwick-shadow/11/0-4-2/2-1) form. Run it with **Astonish** and double Fire charge moves (**Flame Charge** to buff yourself and **Mystical Fire** to weaken the opposition, letting you choose what's most advantageous in any given battle).

- I don't know how much I trust it, but I would be remiss to NOT point out interesting [**AERODACTYL**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/aerodactyl/11/1-5-2/2-1) looks here... on paper, at least. Anyone willing to test it out for science?


## **...AND THAT'S IT!**

Whew, we're done! And before the format arrives this time! Hope this is a help, and best of luck in this funky format, folks.

Thank you for reading, especially those of you who took the time to read it ALL! I sincerely hope this helps you master Little Holiday Cup, and in the most affordable way possible. Best of luck, and catch you next time... and Happy Holidays, Pokéfriends!"
Nifty Or Thrifty: Little Holiday Cup 2024,TheSilphArena,1hgiy70,2024-12-17 14:42:41,66,0.98,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphArena/comments/1hgiy70/nifty_or_thrifty_little_holiday_cup_2024/,JRE47,Battle Team Analysis,"The ""Nifty Or Thrifty"" article series takes a comprehensive look at the meta for PvP Cup formats: [**Holiday Cup** in Little League](https://pokemongohub.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KoFwZQt.png), in this case. As is typical for the NoT series, I'll cover not only the top meta picks, but also some mons where you can save some dust with cheaper second move unlock costs or using as little XL Candy as possible. Because for those on a stardust budget — and/or folks trying to save up some dust for the future — it can be daunting trying to figure out where to spend or not spend it. We all want to field competitive teams, but where can we get the best bang for our buck and where should we perhaps channel our inner scrooge?

A quick reminder of what Holiday Cup (Little League Edition) is:

- Little League, 500 CP Limit.

- Only **Electric, Flying, Ghost, Grass, Ice,** and **Normal** type Pokémon are allowed.

As I try to usually do, I will start with those with the cheapest second move unlock cost and steam ahead until we finally arrive at the expensive Legendaries. Although in this meta, there is one thing I need to get out of the way first....

## **NO SECOND MOVE AVAILABLE**

**SMEARGLE**

*Incinerate/Lock-On/Karate Chop/Sucker Punch/Astonish/etc | Flying Press/Fly/Stone Edge/etc/etc*

~~The possibilities are literally endless. People have done all kinds of crazy things to get some insane movesets on their Smeargles, as you can take a photo of something with Frustration and get almost any move in the game in that same move slot with the resulting, photobombing Smeargle. The one a lot of people seem to talk about for THIS meta is [**Incinerate/Flying Press**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/42-52-0/2-1),  and while that is indeed terrifying, you know what? Smeargle can get [even](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/47-52-0/2-1) [scarier](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/42-34-0/2-1). [MUCH](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/70-130-0/2-1) scarier. And [some combinations](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/smeargle/11/47-125-0/2-1) don't even require Frustration hijinks... that last one can be had by photobombing the right Regirock, for example. The only thing that will keep it from completely taking over this Cup is that it has to be maxed out to approach 500 CP, and many cannot do that.~~

~~I'll be sure to highlight things that generally handle Smeargle as we go, for the majority of us that don't have one but want to be able to enjoy this meta anyway. Here we go with the rest of the review!~~

So Smeargle is banned... huzzah! Pleased to say you can just ignore anything about it from here on out.


## **10,000 Dust/25 Candy**

**PIKACHU LIBRE**

*Thunder Shock | Flying Press & Thunder Punch*

The fact that [it is SO good here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre/11/1-1-3/2-1) shouldn't be... well, *shocking*. (Yesssss... your groans only make me stronger!) **Flying Press** remains a completely broken move (only 40 energy for 90 damage with *no drawbacks*) that is only kept in check by the fact that hardly anything has it... just Hawlucha, potentially Smeargle (more on that menace later), and ol' reward-for-reaching-Legend Libre. But as if that wasn't good enough, Libre just had **Thunder Shock** *and* **Thunder Punch** buffed  too. Not only does it do all the stuff you'd expect of an Electric type (beating every Water type and nearly every Flying type in the Cup), but it also smacks around a ton of Fighting-weak Ice, Normal, and/or Rock types... you know, a massive chunk of the meta. Throw in bonus wins over the big Fire types and stuff like Annihilape, and *dang*, this is a good target for trades before the Cup arrives, don't you think? The good news is that you can rather easily get it at 500 CP or less in a trade, and even with ""bad"" IVs, [it performs about the same](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre-20-10-10-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-1-3/2-1). (Even with [REALLY bad IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_libre-20-14-8-8-4-4-1-1/11/1-1-3/2-1)!)

Still don't have one? There are other Pikachus you can use, though none reach quite that same level. [**ROCK STAR**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_rock_star/11/1-3-1/2-1) comes the closest, though it misses out on big things that Flying Press is needed to beat, like Abomasnow, Diggersby, Alolan Vulpix, and Amaura and Aurorus. And that's where Libre's advantages mostly lie: beating Ice and Normal and Rock types that Fighting damage *should* beat, as well as many opposing Electric types. Rock Star's **Meteor Mash** *does* have its own advantages though, allowing Rock Star to overcome most Ghosts and even most otherwise deadly Ground types, as well as, interestingly, a bunch of Grass types too. It has a bit more merit than those core meta sims would imply, with less than 10 wins separating it and Libre when you consider the entire 500+ Pokémon format.

""**FLYING**"" Pikachu (there are several variants, but any of the ones with **Fly** as a charge attack count) is [another interesting one here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_flying/11/1-4-2/2-1), particularly if it has [high rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu_flying-21-1-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/1-4-2/2-1) which adds on stuff like Annihilape, Shadow A-Wak, and sometimes Smeargle to a winlist that already includes stuff not even Libre can beat, like Joltik, Litwick, and Grasses like Chikorita. But uh... you still lose things that Flying Press annihilates like Amaura/Aurorus, Aboma, Diggersby, Alolan Vulpix/Ninetales and such.

Things do fall off a bit after that, though. [Regular Pikachu](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pikachu-21-1-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/2-5-2/2-1) wants good IVs AND Legacy **Surf**, and still comes in mostly behind the others. It can work, but it's more of an uphill battle and at that point you're probably best off looking elsewhere. Like to big bro [**RAICHU**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/raichu/11/2-1-4/2-1), perhaps! At least it can also dish out some Fighting damage with **Brick Break**. Call it a poor man's Libre.

**FLETCHLING**

*Quick Attack | Fly & Swift*

Fun fact: Fletchling is NOT a Fire type like its two evolutions. It's a Normal Birb, so both **Quick Attack** and the recently buffed **Swift** actually get STAB damage! It's actually [the best Flying type in this format](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/fletchling) *period* by a pretty wide margin... after all, most Flyers struggle with all the Pikachus I just talked about! Fletchling struggles there too obviously, but what it DOES do that otherr Flyers cannot is beat things like CharmTales, Skeledirge, Mandibuzz, Miltank, Diggersby, and Alolan Marowak that should appear frequently. It's a very nice option in this format.

**TALONFLAME**

*Incinerateᴸ | Fly & Flame Charge*

While it's ranked much lower, [Talonflame is actually a close competitor to its pre-evolution](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/talonflame/11/1-4-3/2-1). Being a Fire type with good Fire damage *does* have its advantages, such as taking out Joltik, Litwick, Alolan Sandslash, and Abomasnow that non-Fire Flyers (like Fletchling) can't really replicate. Realistically the bulk of the damage is going to be done with **Incinerate**, as Talonflame lacks the bulk to reach many charge moves, but **Fly** and **Flame Charge** offer the best overall coverage and affordable cost... the rest are kind of overkill anyway.

**CHARIZARD**

*Fire Spin | Dragon Claw & Blast Burnᴸ*

ALL that said, here comes a bit of a shock: [Charizard might actually be the best of all](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/talonflame/11/1-4-3/2-1). As with most Flyers other than Fletchling, it does generally lose to Miltank, Diggersby, and Mandibuzz, but it beats *everything* Talonflame can plus Skeledirge, Alolan Vulpix, Shadow Alolan Marowak, and Talon itself in the head to head, thanks in very large part to **Dragon Claw**, which is a much better weapon in this low HP League than it usually is elsewhere. And **Fire Spin** was also buffed in Season 20 with a bit more damage. Zard is pretty gnarly in this meta, folks! I don't recommend [ShadowZard](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/charizard-shadow/11/3-1-2/2-1) *quite* as much (it struggles with Litwick and does even worse than others versus Smeargle), but it's certainly viable too.

**SKELEDIRGE**

*Incinerate | Disarming Voice & Shadow Ball*

[It's pretty great in this meta](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/skeledirge/11/1-4-2/2-1), doing big Fire things while also handling (most) other Fires thanks to **Shadow Ball**, stuff like Annihilape thanks to **Disarming Voice**, and occasional bonuses like Aurorus too. I like its versatility, though spoiler alert: Alolan Marowak that we cover later is generally a bit better all-around.

**PYROAR & LITLEO**

*Incinerate | Flame Charge & Dark Pulse/Crunch*

[Pyroar](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pyroar/11/2-1-2/2-1) and [Litleo](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litleo/11/2-3-1/2-1) also bring the heat with **Incinerate**, which is just nasty in HP-capped Little League. Pyroar's **Dark Pulse** is better at picking off Skeledirge (and Ghosts in general), but that's about all that separates the pair. One big downside: while the Ghostly and Flying Fire types above can all handle the otherwise scary Incinerate/Flying Press Smeargle, Pyroar and Litleo — being part Normal and thus weak to Flying Press — don't survive. As this is very quietly but very importantly one of the top roles for Fire types in this meta, not handling Flying Press Smeargle is a notable knock against this otherwise powerful pair.

**BIBAREL**

*Rollout | Surf & Hyper Fang*

What better way to extinguish those Fires than with some Water? Conveniently, Bibarel's new **Rollout** smashes Fire types too, as well as bringing in utility versus all the Ice and Flying types in this meta. [Put it all together](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/bibarel/11/0-3-2/2-1), and I would say that Bib is criminally underrated going into Little Holiday Cup, nearly ranking outside the Top 100. [Shadow Bibarel](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/bibarel-shadow/11/0-3-2/2-1) is just as good too, picking up Mandibuzz in 1- and 2shield, Diggersby with shields down, and Alolan Sandslash in 2shield, while trading away only Joltik in 0shield and Miltank in 1shield among things in the core meta. Either way, if you have a good one, this is a GREAT place to use it as one of the very best thrifty options, dirt cheap to build even right now from the ground up.

**DIGGERSBY**

*Quick Attack | Fire Punch & Scorching Sands*

[Particularly with high rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/diggersby-13-2-14-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-5-3/2-1) (which gains things like Libre in 1shield, Alolan Vulpix in 0shield, and Skeledirge in 2shield as compared to [more average IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/diggersby/11/1-5-3/2-1)), Diggs is a pretty good half-Normal in this meta too, holding down most major Fire and Electric types (as you would expect), plus things CharmTales and Miltank as bonuses. Its mixed moveset makes it threatening to nearly everything in the meta, though most Ice and Grass types can maneuver around **Fire Punch** long enough to escape with a win. They don't feel too good when it's over, though! 🔥

**OBSTAGOON**

*Counter | Night Slash & Cross Chop*

It's obviously diminished with the nerf to **Counter**, but there's not much here that has a full Fighting moveset, so yes, [Goonie is still good enough](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/obstagoon-7-10-15-10-4-4-1-1/11/0-4-1/2-1). Its role is clear: beat up on (most) Ice and Normal types, and little else, though wins over Stunfisk and some Ghosts like Shadow Litwick are nice bonuses.

**SENTRET**

*Quick Attack | Brick Break & Dig*

For another Normal type with Fighting damage, PvPoke recommends DUBWOOL with Double Kick. However, [I'm not overly impressed](). Instead, I'm actually going to recommend rolling with [Sentret and its **Brick Break**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sentret/11/0-1-2/2-1). While Dubwool can take down A-Slash and Sentret cannot, look at all that Sentret CAN beat that Dubwool struggles with: Amaura, Abomasnow, A-Vulpix, Stunfisk, Litwick and more. That said, Dubwool IS rather beastly [if it gets a Wild Charge around shields](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/dubwool/00/0-3-1/2-1) (while Sentret is [more pedestrian](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sentret/00/0-1-2/2-1) in 0shield), so this might come down to playstyle and team composition. But I like little Sentret quite a bit here, and heck, when else are you going to have a chance to use it? Go have some fun... after all, it's a *game*, right?

**ELEKID**

*Thunder Shock | Brick Break & Thunder Punch*

Speaking of **Brick Break**, [check out Elekid](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/elekid/11/1-1-4/2-1)! With that and the buffed **Thunder Shock** and **Thunder Punch**, it's an amazingly scrappy little guy in this meta. And yes, you MAY actually have one lying around at 500 CP or less; while it's never been in the wild and the vast majority have come only via hatching (which is way too high level), past special research during the Instinctive Hero event in May 2023, and again during the Triumph Together event just this past August. Check and see if you have an unexpected treasure in your collection! It handles all the stuff you'd expect of an Electric type AND a ton of Fighting-weak Ice, Normal, and/or Rock types, and conveniently most of the big Fire types too!

**LEAVANNY**

*Shadow Clawᴸ | Leaf Blade & X-Scissor*

There's a good chance you didn't bother building a Little League Leavanny during its Community Day. But [*if you did*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/leavanny/11/2-1-4/2-1).... And if not, you can build one during the December Community Day rehash and at least run it for the second week of Little Holiday Cup when it comes back on December 31st.

**COTTONEE**

*Charm/Razor Leaf | Seed Bomb & Grass Knot*

Listen, Uncle JRE is going to be straight with you: [Cottonee is not very good here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/cottonee-30.5-0-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-2-3/2-1). But I *also* recognize the reality that a ton of people run it in any all eligible Little League formats, so you WILL see it. Count on that, and just be careful not to get your Electric or Ground or Fighting or Dragon or Dark type locked in against a Cottonee in the back.

**JIGGLYPUFF**

*Feint Attack | Swift & Disarming Voice*

For mostly the same reasons as Cottonee, [WIGGLYTUFF is also lackluster here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/wigglytuff/11/0-7-5/2-1), but [*Jiggly*puff could be a surprising star](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/jigglypuff/11/0-6-3/2-1). **Disarming Voice** is plenty of Fairy damage in this HP-capped meta, and **Swift** is obviously pretty great now too. **Feint Attack** is *not* all that great, but at least it can reach those charge moves much faster than Charm, and the combination of those moves and that intriguing, Ghost-resistant Normal/Fairy typing makes Jiggly dangerous to a surprising number of things in Little Holiday Cup. [**IGGLYBUFF**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/igglybuff/11/0-4-3/2-1) is a slightly different flavor that works nicely too, but is MUCH more expensive to build.

**ALTARIA**

*Dragon Breath | Sky Attack & Moonblastᴸ*

I know people have build Little League Altarias in the past, but they've been relegated to the dust bin for quite a while now. [This MAY be the time to try it out again](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/altaria-9.5-3-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-4-3/2-1) as a decent generalist that also happens to beat the terrifying Incinerate Smeargle (even with the dreaded Flying Press too!)... but one which MUST avoid Ice. Nearly its entire core meta loss list is Ice types (and/or Fairies). Bring it in at the right moment and it still has enough left in the tank to dominate one more time.


## **50,000 Dust/50 Candy**

**ALOLAN MAROWAK**

*Fire Spin | Bone Club & Shadow Boneᴸ/Shadow Ball*

Ranked all the way up at [#3 in Little Holiday Cup](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/marowak_alolan_shadow) (*and* [also #4](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/holiday/500/overall/marowak_alolan)!), and you know what? [I see little reason to argue with that](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/marowak_alolan-shadow/11/0-1-5/2-1). The majorly buffed **Bone Club** (with support from **Shadow Bone**, or **Shadow Ball** in a pinch) buries opposing Fire types, **Fire Spin** burns through Ice and Grass types and stuff like Joltik, and the combination takes down notable Normals like Miltank, Diggersby, and yes, most iterations of Smeargle that you can expect to see as well (like the Incinerate/Flying Press gold standard), without needing resisted Shadow Bone/Ball at all. That's all for the Shadow version, at least... notable that [non-Shadow A-Wak](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/marowak_alolan/11/0-1-5/2-1) lags a bit behind by losing to things like Joltik, Diggersby, and Talonflame. There is very little reason NOT to run A-Wak if you have one at the ready! ☠️

**ALOLAN SANDSLASH**

*Powder Snow | Ice Punch & Drill Run*

With the buff to **Ice Punch**, [A-Slash](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandslash_alolan/11/1-6-4/2-1) more clearly gets the nod over [ALOLAN SANDSHREW](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandshrew_alolan/11/1-3-1/2-1) now more than ever. And yes, you can build it without Legacy **Shadow Claw**... with the number of Ghost-resistant Normal types around, **Powder Snow** is generally better in this meta anyway, with wins Claw cannot match like Mandibuzz, Diggerby, and Miltank. Shadow A-Slash is very similar but perhaps slightly better, with no major differences in 1shield, an extra win over Diggersby with shields down, and most impressively, added wins versus Stunfisk, Libre, Shadow A-Vulpix, *and* Amaura [in 2v2 shielding](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sandslash_alolan-shadow/22/1-6-4/2-1). 

**ALOLAN NINETALES**

*Charm/Powder Snow | Weather Ball (Ice) & Psyshock*

For **Charm**Tales, [Shadow is better](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan-shadow/11/0-5-4/2-1), with extra wins [non-Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan/11/0-5-4/2-1) cannot match like Libre, Miltank, and Amaura. If you insist, though, you CAN run [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ninetales_alolan-shadow/11/2-5-4/2-1) and also do pretty well as a Shadow, trading away things like Libre and CharmTales itself to instead beat stuff like Stunfisk and Diggersby. Which suits YOUR team better, dear reader?

**ALOLAN VULPIX** is, honestly, [rather disappointing](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/vulpix_alolan-23-0-15-14-4-4-1-1-shadow/11/0-2-5/2-1), however. You certainly *can* run it, but I'm having a hard time thinking of what it can do that other Ice options aren't just better at....

**SNORUNT**

*Powder Snow | Icy Wind & Shadow Ball*

One base evolutionary Ice that *does* work well is little chilly Snorunt. **Powder Snow** and **Icy Wind** are a good start, and then **Shadow Ball**pushes things over the edge with wins over several Ice types (Amaura and Alolan Sandslash, Ninetales, and Vulpix). [High rank IVs](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/snorunt-23-0-15-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-4-2/2-1) bring in Joltik and Abomasnow too. Neat!

**SPHEAL/SEALEO**

*Water Gun | Body Slam & Water Pulse*

As we somewhat saw with Bibarel, Water damage can be powerful in this meta, so yes, Spheal and Sealeo seem best not with the standard **Powder Snow**, but humble **Water Gun** instead, rolling from there into widely neutral **Body Slam** and MORE Water damage with **Water Pulse**. Spheal has slightly more bulk and [a slightly better record](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spheal/11/1-2-3/2-1) (+ Amaura), but [Sealeo works just fine too](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/sealeo/11/1-2-3/2-1)... you can play whichever one you have ready for Little League and barely notice a difference. And if you just can't bear the thought of having NO Ice coverage, sure, you can run [Aurora Beam](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spheal/11/1-2-1/2-1), but it *is* slightly worse overall and doesn't gain you what you'd think... it's just not a very good move.

**WALREIN**

*Waterfall/Powder Snowᴸ | Icicle Spearᴸ & Water Pulse/Earthquake*

Well similar to Water Gun above, it's finally arrived: the meta where [**Waterfall** Walrein](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein-shadow/11/2-3-2/2-1) is legit! Yes, [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein/11/1-4-3/2-1) is still fine too (for non-Shadow Wally, at least), as long as you still tote around Water damage output via **Water Pulse**. But as you can tell by going even to the extreme of [eliminating Ice damage *entirely*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein/11/2-2-4/2-1) — normally an insane idea when you consider how good Powder Snow and **Icicle Spear** are — Water damage is really good here. I feel like I said that already? Anyway, I'd probably still try and [keep Spear in the mix](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/walrein-shadow/11/2-3-4/2-1) somewhere, but it's nice to have options... and the option to build Wally for this meta without needing ANY Legacy moves at all if you want to.

I also recommend running contrary to the normal [**Powder Snow**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/abomasnow-shadow/11/1-2-5/2-1) and instead using [**Leafage**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/abomasnow-shadow/11/0-4-5/2-1) if you run **ABOMASNOW**, just because it makes it quite unique here and gives it a niche... but honestly, I'm having trouble recommending Aboma at all. You can expect to see it here, though... similar to stuff like Cottonee, while it may not be highly recommended in this meta, it's a staple in Little League already that people WILL pull off the shelf.

Similarly, I normally DO recommend **SWINUB** in Little League, but [it's a bit worse than I hoped to see](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/swinub/11/0-4-2/2-1) in this particular meta. I think it has enough niche use to consider over Aboma, at least, but it probably requires some thoughful team composition to be as useful as it normally seems to be in formats like this.

**JOLTIK**

*Sucker Punch | Cross Poison & Bug Buzz/Discharge*

A bit of a weird one, as Joltik operates much more as a Swiss Army knife than its more straightforward big bro Galvantula. **Sucker Punch** and **Cross Poison** make this little guy truly unique in this meta, threatening and beating many Ghosts (even ones scary for Bugs like A-Wak and Skeledirge) as well as relevant Fairies like Alolan Ninetales and Grasses like Hisuian Electrode, and by resisting all of its moves, Pikachu Libre as a very nice bonus. Then it's just decision time on the closer: [**Discharge**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/joltik-19.5-0-15-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-2-3/2-1) to try and blow away stuff like Talonflame, Litwick, and Aurorus, or [**Bug Buzz**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/joltik-19.5-0-15-14-4-4-1-1/11/1-2-1/2-1) to add on things like Stunfisk and Diggersby?

**HISUIAN ELECTRODE**

*Thunder Shock | Swift & Wild Charge*

As I just mentioned it (I think for the first time?), yeah, let's highlight [how good H-Trode is here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/electrode_hisuian/11/1-2-3/2-1). The buff to **Swift** (and **Thunder Shock**) is huge, giving it a ton of wins it could never achieve with pre-move-buff stats like Amaura and Aurorus (thanks to better baiting), Alolan Ninetales (and Vulpix), Abomasnow, Miltank, and Libre. And of course, it does the Electric job well, though its Grass type is just as much a curse (weakness to the Ice/Water types that most Electrics should pretty well dominate, for example) as it is a blessing (resisting Water, making Ground damage neutral). 

**TOGEDEMARU**

*Thunder Shock | Fell Stinger & Wild Charge*

Nothing fancy here, just capitalizing on the buffed **Thunder Shock** again. **Fell Stinger** bait-n-buffs are important to take out things like Pibre and Alolan Ninetales/Vulpix, but Toge is pretty well positioned in this meta anyway thanks to the OHKO that often comes with Wild Charge at this level, as well as the many helpful resistances (Ice, Rock, and Normal especially) that come with its Steel subtyping. The downside? Vulnerabilities to Fighting (Flying Press, anyone?) and Fire that will be omnipresent in Little Holiday Cup.

**TADBULB**

*Thunder Shock | Parabolic Charge & Discharge*

Ever less fancy here, as we're talking straight Electric typing and moves. But what Tad has that most other Electrics do not is bulk. it also has (again) buffed **Thunder Shock** leading into fine charge moves, and [that takes it a good long way](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/tadbulb/11/0-2-1/2-1). I don't know that I'd burn a lot of resources on one, but if you happen to have one close to 500 CP already, it could be fun here and is likely WAY off most peoples' radar.

**LANTURN**

*Water Gun | Surf & Thunderbolt*

And speaking of bulk... yes, [you can run Lanturn here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lanturn-9.5-0-10-12-4-4-1-1/11/2-4-2/2-1). It's diminished, but still just fine. Do focus on its wet side, though... **Water Gun** is probably the way to go here.

**DUCKLETT**

*Water Gun/Wing Attack | Aerial Ace & Bubble Beam/Brave Bird*

I know, the know... the mere mention of this one has some of you breaking out in hives. I am sorry to report that Ducklett may be primed to terrorize yet another Little League meta... but this time, [by showing its wet side](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ducklett/11/0-1-3/2-1). That's right... while you CAN still run [**Wing Attack**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ducklett/11/1-3-1/2-1) and do okay, the wins it gets that way (mostly Grasses like Aboma and Chikorita) seem to me to have far less value than what **Water Gun** can do (beating stuff like A-Slash, A-Pix, Aurorus, Amaura, and even Smeargle instead). The caveat is that some wins are at least partially reliant on **Bubble Beam**, things like CharmTales, Amaura, and Annihilape... but the other stuff above (yes, including Smeargle still) can be had just by spamming **Aerial Ace** with no bait games required. The Duck Of Doom WILL strike again, so be prepared.

**PELIPPER**

*Wing Attack | Weather Ball (Water) & Hurricane*

*Here*, however, things still work out best with **Wing Attack**, as there's plenty of good Water spam already with **Weather Ball**. Overall though, [it's a worse Ducklett](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pelipper/11/1-4-2/2-1), if I'm being perfectly honest. That may be just fine for some teams, though!

**FARFETCH'D**

*Fury Cutter | Leaf Blade & Aerial Ace*

And real quick while we're on birbs, Farfetch'd isn't a world beater, but [it does look like fun](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/farfetchd/11/2-3-1/2-1) in Little Holiday Cup, if you've always been itching to try it out. Just throwing the idea out there... and using it to transition to analyzing a few more Normal types! Now you know my secret. 🤫

**DUNSPARCE**

*Rollout | Drill Run & Rock Slide*

Yeah yeah yeah... it'll lose to stuff with Fighting damage (read as: Flying Press and maybe Annihilape). We got it. [That doesn't take away from all the good that Dundun can do](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/dunsparce/11/2-2-3/2-1)! 👀 Seriously, take Fighting stuff away and its entire core meta loss list is Rock-resistant Diggersby, the Shadow versions of A-Wak and CharmTales (no shame in either of those), and dedicated Grass type (and [unlikely to actually be used very much](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/chikorita/11/2-1-3/2-1)) Chikorita. That's it... that's the list, people. It destroys other Ice, Fire, Bug, Flying, Ghost, and even most Normal types. See if you have one ready... Dundun is a fantastic generalist here as long as you can avoid getting it locked in versus Fighting damage.

**LICKILICKY**

*Rollout | Body Slamᴸ & Shadow Ball/Earthquake*

Less impressive, but [still quite good](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickilicky/11/1-1-4/2-1). **Shadow Ball** has the speed and effectiveness to blast through Skeledirge, Amaura, and A-Slash, while [**Earthquake**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickilicky/11/1-1-2/2-1) instead buries Joltik, Stunfisk, and Miltank.

And no, **LICKITUNG** [isn't as good as you remember](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lickitung/11/0-1-3/2-1), either. Sorrynotsorry... I hate that thing almost as much as Chansey. *shudder* (Good time to remind folks... [DO NOT RUN CHANSEY](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/chansey/11/0-4-2/2-1)!!)

**URSARING**

*Shadow Claw | Swift & Close Combat*

I don't have a lot to say here... [it just *works*](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/ursaring/11/2-4-1/2-1), with **Swift** being the final piece to finally make Ursaring PvP-relevant. **Shadow Claw** makes it a great Ghostbuster, it outlasts Libre, shreds Ice types with **Close Combat**, blows out Fire types as a bonus. It's solid, just flimsy. That's a bit of a paradox, ain't it? 🤔

**SPINDA**

*Sucker Punch | Icy Wind & Rock Tomb*

As it's only even been available in research (and raids), and thus needs to be traded to drop below 10-10-10 IVs, #1 rank IVs with 0 Attack is basically just theotetical, which is a shame because [it would be AMAZING here](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spinda-16.5-0-12-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-2/2-1). As is, we probably have to ""settle"" for something [like this](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/spinda-15.5-5-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-2/2-1), which misses out on only A-Slash and Amaura (and only sometimes!) and is still just fine. I like it... the buff to **Sucker Punch** has only made it more interesting, and it was always at least spicy in Little League. Might be more like full-on meta now!

**GIRAFARIG**

*Double Kick | Psychic Fangs & Trailblaze*

Geoffamafig ranked SUPER low... like outside the Top 250 kind of low. But that's because it's showing with Confusion... and you really want to be running [**Double Kick**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/girafarig-shadow/11/1-3-5/2-1) instead. And it can actually perform a bit *better* than even that shows, as **Psychic Fangs** alone can add on unlisted wins [Skeledirge](https://pvpoke.com/battle/sandbox/500/girafarig-9.5-4-11-4-4-4-1-1-shadow/skeledirge-6.5-4-4-11-4-4-1-1/22/1-3-0/1-4-2/10.100010-16.111100-20.100010) and [Stunfisk](https://pvpoke.com/battle/500/girafarig-9.5-4-11-4-4-4-1-1-shadow/stunfisk-8.5-10-14-13-4-4-1-1/11/1-3-0/1-3-1) too! Look at how my boy Farigamarif has grown! Brings a tear to my eye.

**ANNIHILAPE**

*Counter | Rage Fistᴸ & Close Combat*

Now we really CAN call it ""Little"" Anni! 😁 Anyway, **Counter** may have been nerfed, but it's still [more than good enough in Little League](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-6-0-12-14-4-4-1-1/11/0-5-1/2-1), pummeling a ton of Ice, Rock, and Normal types (including [FP Smeargle](https://pvpoke.com/battle/500/annihilape-6-0-12-14-4-4-1-1/smeargle-50-15-15-15-4-4-1-1/11/0-5-1/42-52-0) and stuff like Litwick too thanks to **Rage Fist**, which is the only charge move you even need 99% of the time. This is particularly true of [Shadow Anni](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-shadow/11/0-5-0/2-1), which actually beats stuff like PowderTales and Chikorita only if it does NOT reach for something like [**Close Combat**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/annihilape-shadow/11/0-5-1/2-1) and sticks with strictly Rage Fist instead. But yeah... in a meta where most other Fighters aren't allowed in, Annihilape gets to roam free and sow some terror.

**DUSKULL**

*Astonish | Night Shade & Returnᴸ/Ominous Wind*

Remember how Dusclops used to only ever be viable in Limited metas if purified to get **Return** as a non-Ghost beatstick closing move? [That's Duskull now](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/duskull/11/0-3-1/2-1), as it needs a non-Ghost move like Return to beat things like Miltank. Anyway, if you run Shadow, [substitute with **Ominous Wind**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/duskull-shadow/11/0-2-1/2-1), I guess, to at least have a shot at the self-buff. For what it's worth, while purified Duskie can outlast Miltank and Chikorita and Amaura, Shadow beats down Talonflame and A-Pix instead.

**HAUNTER**

*Shadow Claw | Ice Punch & Shadow Punch*

**Shadow Ball** is not only overkill in this meta, but also just too expensive. The improved **Shadow Punch** is plenty, and pairs very nicely with **Ice Punch** [for maximum destructive capability](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/haunter/11/2-2-4/2-1). Thanks in large part to Ice Punch, Haunter crosses off things Duskull (and indeed, most Ghosts in general) cannot like Diggersby, Mandibuzz, Abomasnow and the A-Pixes. On the downside, it lacks the bulk of Duskull and therefore loses to other Ghosts like A-Wak and Litwick, as well as Miltank and, despite resisting Fairy damage, CharmTales as well. But still, it does a lot of good in blindingly fast fashion. Somebody is gonna wreck face with Haunter, I am sure of it.

**LURANTIS**

*Fury Cutter | Leaf Blade & Superpower*

Finishing up this section with [a fun one](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/lurantis/11/0-1-3/2-1) many may miss otherwise. Lurantis comes with some awesome moves, spamming **Leaf Blade** in a meta where not much resists it, and **Superpower** to turn the tables on most Ice types. Many Grasses struggle to make an impact in this meta, but when they do, as Lurantis does, the resistances to Electric and Ground come in handy with wins like Diggersby, Stunfisk, and Pikachu Libre. **FOMANTIS** works too, and though it lacks Superpower, it instead buffs itself with **Trailblaze** and therefore still has [much the same winlist](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/fomantis/11/0-3-4/2-1) anyway, missing out on PowderTales but gaining Joltik instead. I lean towards Lurantis but I gotta say, I didn't expect Fomantis to look *that* good.


## **75,000 Dust/75 Candy**

Alright, you know how this goes by now. Space is tight and TIME is tight, so we're going rapid fire for the more expensive picks. Most of them have been mentioned throughout anyway. Here we go!

- [**AMAURA**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/amaura/11/1-4-1/2-1) and [**AURORUS**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/aurorus/11/1-6-1/2-1) are both pretty great, smashing through most other Ices, Electrics, Ghosts, Flyers, Fires, Grounds and all the stuff in between. Mostly their only fear in this meta is things with Rollout, really good Ground moves (like A-Slash and its Drill Run), and Fighting damage. Beyond that, they have a LOT of room to romp.

- **MILTANK** is [nearly as theatening](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/miltank/11/0-1-3/2-1) as fellow **Rollout** spewing Dunsparce. Dundun wins the head to head and also adds on A-Slash, but **ice Beam** gives Millie some unique reach and it really comes down to which one you have on hand to use. Both are quite excellent in Little Holiday Cup.

- There's nothing particularly special about **EEVEE**, but [it's a fine generalist](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/eevee/11/0-2-4/2-1), especially if you have a costumed and/or shiny one to show off! And with the buff to Swift, you don't need to reach for any Legacy moves anymore either!

- Like the Ghost Of Christmas Past, [**VIGOROTH**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/vigoroth/11/0-1-2/2-1) could pop up again here to get you feeling nostalgic... or just angry. It probably wants **Brick Break** over **Rock Slide**, but otherwise it's mostly the same spammy creep you remember in THIS meta, at least.

- Everything I said earlier about Tadbulb and Electrics in general? [**PACHIRISU**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/pachirisu/11/1-3-2/2-1) does all that too, and it's a hoot to use in Little League for the many of us that will likely NEVER get one maxed out for Great League use.

- **MAREEP** is surprisingly okay in this meta as well, particularly [as a Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/mareep-shadow/11/1-1-2/2-1). Absolutely nothing outstanding when you look at it, but **Thunder Shock** + **Body Slam** can still do good things in this League.

- Original Recipe **STUNFISK** doesn't like the cold of all the Ice types around, but [does plenty else really well](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/stunfisk/11/1-3-1/2-1). Fires and Flyers and Electrics especially want nothing to do with it.

- Man, you cannot let yourself get into battle with anything that slings Ice, but [**GLISCOR**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/gliscor-shadow/11/1-1-3/2-1) with new **Sand Attack** could do some nifty things in this meta for anyone brave (or crazy!) enough to try.

- Less crazy is the idea of running [**GOLETT**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/golett/11/1-3-1/2-1). **Mud Slap** to bury Fires and Electrics, **Shadow Punch** and **Brick Break** to strike back at Ghosts and Normals and even a number of Ice types, and a typing that resists Fighting damage and therefore takes down Annihilape and Flying Press users too. What's NOT to like? This is just a full-on meta pick here, folks.

- It's been namedropped a lot, and yes, **LITWICK** is quite good in [regular](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litwick/11/0-4-2/2-1) or [Shadow](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/litwick-shadow/11/0-4-2/2-1) form. Run it with **Astonish** and double Fire charge moves (**Flame Charge** to buff yourself and **Mystical Fire** to weaken the opposition, letting you choose what's most advantageous in any given battle).

- I don't know how much I trust it, but I would be remiss to NOT point out interesting [**AERODACTYL**](https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/500/holiday/aerodactyl/11/1-5-2/2-1) looks here... on paper, at least. Anyone willing to test it out for science?


## **...AND THAT'S IT!**
