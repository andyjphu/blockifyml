Let‚Äôs talk CES and its impact. With groundbreaking technology emerging at the event, the demand for advanced cybersecurity solutions is more critical than ever. PolySwarm ($NCT) has real-world utility in this space, addressing the pressing need for robust threat detection and mitigation in an increasingly digital landscape.

As NVIDIA continues to revolutionize industries with its AI robotics systems, the value of $NCT is poised to rise significantly. We are witnessing the dawn of a transformative era‚Äîa new technological frontier. The next five years will shape the trajectory of humanity, and $NCT‚Äôs current valuation at $0.11 represents a fraction of its potential.

Securing a loan in one of the most competitive markets is no small feat. It‚Äôs a clear testament to the trust and credibility behind PolySwarm. Institutions don‚Äôt invest in mediocrity‚Äîthis is the future of cybersecurity.

At PolySwarm, we‚Äôre always working on fresh ways to strengthen our platform, and we‚Äôve got some exciting updates on the way! We‚Äôre adding a new feature to support in-depth, manual malware analysis. Soon, our platform will allow vendors to offer specialized malware analysis services, and our customers will be able to hire these experts directly through our platform for thorough manual assessments. We're starting with a small, trusted group of partners, but we‚Äôre excited to begin expanding this service over the next year, bringing more choices and flexibility to our community.

We‚Äôre also making significant strides to improve NCT accessibility and build more visibility for it within the crypto community. Part of our upcoming development will focus on empowering the PolySwarm community to crowdsource data through our new AI-driven phishing feature for NectarNet. Participating in this feature will not only help strengthen our cybersecurity platform, but users will also gain access to a tool that helps to protect from phishing and other malicious online attacks. This will be a huge benefit for anyone engaged with digital assets.

In addition, we‚Äôve been hard at work with significant infrastructure upgrades to make everything run smoother and more efficiently behind the scenes. We're enhancing our support for private, customizable communities, giving users even more security and control.

And soon, we‚Äôll be improving our notification system, too. While we already provide email alerts for key events, our goal is to make notifications even more effective so users never miss an important update.

These updates are part of our larger vision to deliver a powerful, user-centered experience, add real-world value, and reinforce our commitment to providing high-quality services. We‚Äôre excited about what‚Äôs ahead for PolySwarm, and we can‚Äôt wait to have you with us on this journey!

Abstract  
  
In this trend analysis expedition, we delve into the cybernetic hive of Polyswarm (NCT), a cryptocurrency token at the forefront of decentralized threat intelligence. By employing a blend of technical indicators and sentimental analysis extracted from the buzzing corridors of social media, this study aims to map the price trends and market sentiment around NCT. We explore its market performance through the lens of moving averages, RSI, and MACD, juxtaposed with real-time X posts sentiment analysis, to dissect the token's behavior in the wild ecosystem of cryptocurrency trading. Despite the inherent unpredictability of markets, akin to forecasting weather in space, our research attempts to offer a navigational chart for trend followers. This abstract encapsulates our endeavor to understand NCT's market dynamics, highlighting the oscillation between technological innovation in cybersecurity and the speculative dance of cryptocurrency investment, all while maintaining a cautious eye on the ever-present hive mind of trader sentiment.

Manual Crypto Arbitrage,coinmatics,1dy3id7,2024-07-08 04:10:58,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coinmatics/comments/1dy3id7/manual_crypto_arbitrage/,coinmatics_io,,"Crypto trading offers many opportunities, and one fascinating method I've discovered is manual crypto arbitrage. This strategy allows traders to take advantage of price differences of crypto assets on different exchanges.

***Understanding manual crypto arbitrage:***

As each exchange has its own price, which is influenced by factors such as trading volume and trading activity, there's an opportunity to profit from the discrepancy between the buy and sell prices of cryptocurrencies. Essentially, you buy a cryptocurrency at a lower rate on one exchange and sell it at a higher rate on another exchange. The price difference can sometimes be as much as 10%.

***Example scenario:***

https://preview.redd.it/x7po3wne49bd1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=082332038872ee17fc202952fe91488e2ed677c6

Consider the trading pair NCT - USDT. On Poloniex, the ask price (the lowest price to buy NCT) is 0.00904, while on Huobi, the bid price (the highest price to sell NCT) is 0.009831. The spread here is 8.7500%, which means that you can potentially earn 8.7500% by trading between these exchanges. However, remember to account for any additional fees or commissions involved in transferring funds between exchanges.

***How does Coinmatics improve manual arbitrage:***

It offers a manual arbitrage service that simplifies the process by aggregating currency rates from multiple exchanges. With their arbitrage panel, all the important information is displayed on one page, allowing you to quickly compare rates and decide on your next move. This efficiency is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto trading.

***Steps to use Coinmatics for arbitrage:***

https://preview.redd.it/79sqcniz49bd1.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=d88e7884f060a49d9aef0e86f80e14503bb98f90

**1. Track rates:** Coinmatics monitors and updates the rates across on multiple exchanges in real time, ensuring you have the most up-to-date data.

**2. Analyze spread:** The platform highlights the spread, which is the difference between the buy and sell prices on different exchanges.

With all the necessary information at your fingertips, you can react quickly to market fluctuations and execute profitable trades.

***Important considerations:***

* **Calculate fees:** While Coinmatics provides the rates, it‚Äôs essential to factor in any additional fees or commissions for transferring funds between exchanges to accurately determine your net profit.
* **Access requirements:** Note that the manual arbitrage feature is available only on Coinmatics‚Äô Premium and Premium Ref plans.

In summary, manual crypto arbitrage can be a profitable strategy if executed with precision. Coinmatics offers a robust toolset to help traders capitalize on price differences across exchanges, ensuring you stay ahead in the trading game. 

If you would like to maximize your crypto earnings, exploring Coinmatics‚Äô manual arbitrage service could be a game-changer."

**March has been a very busy and productive month for the Swarm, with a number of updates deployed over the past month:**

* Our long-anticipated URL sandboxing feature has been deployed.
* We are also pleased to announce the launch of our EU portal. This comprehensive portal integrates private communities, and work on public community initiatives will start soon. This marks a significant step forward in our service offerings.
* We identified and addressed several bugs within our NectarNet extension, and our team was able to rectify the issues.
* Bug fixes for the portal to resolve a small collection of reported bugs have been mostly completed.
* We are now 1 of 11 projects on CoinGecko in the new Top Cybersecurity category. Securing a spot in this category marks a momentous milestone, underscoring our dedication to bolstering global cybersecurity efforts. This recognition validates our commitment and amplifies our visibility, enhancing our standing within the community.

**Over the coming month, the team will be focusing on a number of projects:**

* The further development of our Sandboxing feature with a focus on triage updates and fixes. Starting with downloading reports as HTML and PDF. Following the completion of this phase, our efforts will shift towards integrating QR code scanning capabilities.
* Tooling to allow examination of portal activity tracking for users mentioned in our previous update will be under continued development. 
* OEM private sandboxing features tailored for our partners.
* Account plan updates.
* And revisions based on customer feedback.

We are excited to share our latest progress as we continue our tireless pursuit of excellence across all facets of our platform. Beyond our tech updates and progress, we are deeply committed to fostering a lively global community of users actively participating with our native token, NCT. We understand the importance of meeting our community's needs, and we're actively striving to improve the usefulness and accessibility of the Nectar token.

We always hear about big coins and exchanges getting hacked for Eth, and BTC but never hear about shitcoins being stolen. That said...

There have been several hacks involving shitcoins. Here are the top 10 examples:

Electroneum (2018) - *a mobile shitcoin mining app that was hacked for $500,000 worth of ETN due to a vulnerability in its online wallet*

Rubycoin (2014) - *a proof-of-work shitcoin that was hacked for 300,000 RBY due to a vulnerability in its code*.

Krypton (2016) - *a shitcoin that was hacked for 21,465 KR due to a vulnerability in its smart contract*

Verge (2018) - *a privacy-focused high quality shitcoin that was hacked for 35 million XVG due to a vulnerability in its mining algorithm*

Vertcoin (2018) - *this shitcoin was hacked for $100,000 worth of VTC due to a 51% attack on its blockchain*

PolySwarm (2018) - *a decentralized antivirus shitcoin marketplace that was hacked for $500,000 worth of Nectar (NCT) due to a vulnerability in its smart contract*

Feathercoin (2013) - *another shitcoom that was hacked for 6 million FTC due to a vulnerability in its code*.

Syscoin (2018) - *a shitcoin that was hacked for $11 million worth of SYS due to a bug in its blockchain*

Bitcoin Gold (2018) - *a shit fork of Bitcoin that was hacked for $18 million worth of BTG due to a 51% attack on its blockchain*.


Last but not least...

Smartcash. I personally owned this promising shitcoin at the time.
In 2018, someone figured out how to mint millions of coins tanking the price within minutes after mass selling them on various shitcoin exchanges until the devs froze the network. This resulted in months long wait where all the holders where in limbo.  

###Honorable Mentions:

Nano(aka Raiblocks)

Although not considered a shitcoin at the time by it's die hard fans, it's pretty much a shitcoin now. With its lightening fast transaction speeds,
In 2018, Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail was hacked for $170 million worth of Nano (XRB), formerly known as RaiBlocks. The exchange claimed that the hack was due to a flaw in the Nano protocol that allowed unauthorized transactions to occur. However, the Nano team disputed this claim and suggested that the hack was a result of BitGrail's poor security practices. The hack resulted in a legal battle between BitGrail and Nano, with both parties blaming each other for the incident.

What is Mars Stealer?

Mars Stealer, reported earlier this year by Morphisec and Kaspersky, is a stealer malware. Earlier this month, @ViriBack, a malware researcher on Twitter, discovered a fake Atomic Wallet site at atomic-wallet.net distributing Mars Stealer.

According to Morphisec, Mars Stealer is based on Oski Stealer and was discovered in June 2021. They noted Mars Stealer is available for sale on several underground forums and continues to be under development. A lifetime subscription to Mars Stealer was available for under $200 USD. Mars Stealer steals user credentials stored in internet browsers and crypto wallets. At the time, Mars Stealer was being distributed via social engineering, malspam, and tainted software cracks and keygens.

Mars Stealer disguises itself as another application or plugin. It checks the victim machine‚Äôs language settings and uninstalls itself if the language is set to Uzbekistan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, or Kazakhstan. It searches the victim machine for various types of information and uninstalls itself after stealing the desired information. Information stolen by Mars Stealer includes browser autofill data, credit card information, plugins, and information identifying victim machines. In the sample Morphisec analyzed, the threat actor compromised their own computer with Mars Stealer while debugging."

NCT rewards are distributed to users who provide relevant cybersecurity threat intelligence.

On PolySwarm, threat intelligence producers (""Engines"") earn tokens by analyzing threats. Engine owners buy tokens to supply their Engines with NCT to participate in the Marketplace. Other token holders can buy/sell tokens to help supply Engines owner's needs. In our upcoming use case, users will receive rewards for generating passive DNS data and staking other user's threat intelligence productivity.

PolySwarm partners with its customers to gather threat intelligence feedback to continuously improve the PolySwarm threat marketplace. PolySwarm‚Äôs global customers trust the PolySwarm threat marketplace intelligence to protect their digital assets and keep their data flow secure. Customers worldwide use the threat marketplace for multi-engine scanning, file-based vulnerability assessment, live and historical hunting for protection from both known and unknown threats. PolySwarm collects ongoing feedback from partnered customers to inform the threat-marketplace development roadmap to directly benefit customers needs.

PolySwarm also partners with individual security experts to develop their threat detection techniques into new detection engines for the marketplace. These unique and independent researcher engines cover the tails of the malware landscape, often not covered by the larger antivirus engines, thus providing added protection to PolySwarm customers. 

PolySwarm analyzes over 800,000 malware samples per day. In this report we track the top ransomware families and add some context from Christopher Elisan (Tophs), PolySwarm‚Äôs VP of threat intelligence.

Let‚Äôs Talk Targets,PolySwarm,thj5d0,2022-03-18 20:20:36,19,0.96,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/PolySwarm/comments/thj5d0/lets_talk_targets/,Abstract-Abacus,,"We all know Polyswarm has potential, but what can we expect the value of NCT to be by the end of this year? I‚Äôd like to crowd source information that we can use to set a price target. These price targets can be useful for aligning token holders, decreasing market churn, and supporting an upward trend. I think it‚Äôs reasonable that with greater interest we could go north of $1. 

Here‚Äôs my current thinking: 

- Market capitalization. Currently low, ~$65M. At $1, the MC would be at ~$1.9B. For strong crypto projects this is very attainable.
- Dilution. Should be minimal from here on. Over 80% of tokens are already in circulation. 
- Growing segment. Cyber security is expected to be a growing segment and few projects exist in the space.
- Competition. From a technology perspective, Polyswarm is novel and currently unique. Competition in the crypto space is currently light, which differs from the Layer 2, Web3, NFTs, and DeFi spaces, which are all quite saturated. 
- Technology. Theoretically sound ‚Äî providing threat assessments on the basis of an ensemble of malware engines is a mathematically proven strategy to improve classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Assuming the integration is done by a machine learning approach that weights the malware engines, this is equivalent to [ensemble learning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). 
- Partnerships. Multiple partnerships with large organizations. While not necessarily valuable in of themselves, they provide validation of the company when they‚Äôre seeking new B2B customers/partnerships. They also may serve as springboards to larger engagements with existing customers/partnerships.
- Hype potential. Not yet listed on Binance, main net integration expected to complete by the end of this month, other milestones (known: NCT payments for DNS queries using browser extension expected to be released soon, plausible: new partnerships, etc.) expected. 
- Geopolitics. War in Ukraine and the potential for cyber attack retaliation for sanctions by Russia. May result in increased investment in cyber security stocks and crypto projects.

All these factors together may lead to a virtuous cycle where social interest (e.g. on Twitter) grows due to current events and milestones leads to increased value. Rinse and repeat. I think $1 is possible this year and represents a solid first long target. I say we start advocating this view widely. That said, a price target is most achievable when it‚Äôs reasonable and makes sense. What are your price targets? Why?"

Decentralized threat detection PolySwarm is a more effective way to detect, analyze and respond to the latest threats, the ones more likely to go undetected by existing solutions. We are a launchpad for new technologies and innovative threat detection methods, where commercial solutions and specialized engines compete to detect malware, and get compensated based on performance.PolySwarm is currently powered by a network of 55 threat detection software, a combination of commercial engines (i.e. Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Kaspersky..) and smaller, specialized ones (Android Judge, Coincinitty, Iris-H‚Ä¶) with a narrower expertise. The former provide a wider range of coverage while the latter excels at detecting and reacting to threats earlier within their field.  The combination of both expands coverage against emerging threats. We differentiate ourselves from other multi scanners like VirusTotal (owned by Google) by:

Focusing on new and emergent malware Usage of niche, research-driven engines as suppliers

Contextual threat scoring to enable automation and save analyst time Performance-based economic incentives to improve accuracy

Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable PolySwarm‚Äôs crowdsourced, and decentralized economic model, where engines are compensated for accurately determining if a file is malicious or not with NCT tokens, through bounties and a staking model where they ‚Äòpay‚Äô to provide opinions. Currently, on testnet, there are over 5 Million transactions taking place daily. NCT is an Ethereum token that powers PolySwarm, a community and network for detecting malware. NCT rewards are distributed to users who provide relevant cybersecurity data while NCT is used to access insights provided by the network.

Decentralized threat detection PolySwarm is a more effective way to detect, analyze and respond to the latest threats, the ones more likely to go undetected by existing solutions. We are a launchpad for new technologies and innovative threat detection methods, where commercial solutions and specialized engines compete to detect malware, and get compensated based on performance.PolySwarm is currently powered by a network of 55 threat detection software, a combination of commercial engines (i.e. Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Kaspersky..) and smaller, specialized ones (Android Judge, Coincinitty, Iris-H‚Ä¶) with a narrower expertise. The former provide a wider range of coverage while the latter excels at detecting and reacting to threats earlier within their field.  The combination of both expands coverage against emerging threats. We differentiate ourselves from other multi scanners like VirusTotal (owned by Google) by:

Focusing on new and emergent malware Usage of niche, research-driven engines as suppliers

Contextual threat scoring to enable automation and save analyst time Performance-based economic incentives to improve accuracy
