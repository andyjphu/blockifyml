What Could Lead to a Total Collapse of the Crypto World?,TradingElite,1hmlq1j,2024-12-26 05:27:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1hmlq1j/what_could_lead_to_a_total_collapse_of_the_crypto/,Maylights,,"Cryptocurrencies have been hailed as a revolutionary financial innovation, offering decentralized systems, anonymity, and freedom from traditional banking constraints. However, the volatile and relatively young nature of the crypto industry leaves it vulnerable to potential risks. A total collapse of the cryptocurrency world might seem improbable to enthusiasts, but certain scenarios could trigger catastrophic outcomes.

**1. Global Regulatory Crackdowns**

Governments worldwide hold the power to disrupt the crypto ecosystem by imposing strict regulations or outright bans. If major economies, such as the U.S., EU, or China, coordinate efforts to restrict cryptocurrency usage, trading, or mining, the ripple effects could devastate the market. For instance:

\- Prohibiting crypto exchanges could cut off access to liquidity.

\- Taxation policies or forced disclosures could deter investors.

\- Bans on decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols could hinder innovation.

While crypto is designed to resist central authority, dependence on fiat-to-crypto gateways and regulatory-compliant exchanges could make such a crackdown effective.

**2. Mass Adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**

Central banks are actively developing their own digital currencies to compete with cryptocurrencies. CBDCs could offer the advantages of crypto—speed, low transaction costs, and digital convenience—while providing the security and backing of a government. If CBDCs become widely adopted, cryptocurrencies might lose their competitive edge, relegating them to niche markets or speculative assets.

**3. Security Breaches on a Massive Scale**

The trust in cryptocurrencies largely relies on the robustness of blockchain technology. However, if there were a successful large-scale attack—such as a 51% attack on Bitcoin or Ethereum—it could undermine confidence in the security of the entire ecosystem. Additionally, if quantum computing advances to a point where it can break current cryptographic protocols, it would render many cryptocurrencies vulnerable to theft and manipulation.

**4. Collapse of Major Stablecoins**

Stablecoins like USDT (Tether) and USDC play a critical role in the crypto market, acting as a bridge between fiat currencies and digital assets. A collapse of one or more major stablecoins, whether due to mismanagement, loss of backing reserves, or regulatory action, could destabilize the market. The TerraUSD (UST) collapse in 2022 is a stark reminder of how fragile stablecoins can be, wiping out billions in market value and shaking investor confidence.

**5. Coordinated Cyber Warfare**

State-sponsored cyber warfare targeting the crypto ecosystem could cause significant damage. For instance:

\- Disabling major exchanges or wallets could lock users out of their funds.

\- Manipulating network nodes or validators in decentralized systems could lead to chaos.

\- Flooding networks with transactions (DDoS attacks) could render blockchains temporarily unusable.

Such actions could make cryptocurrencies unreliable and force users back to traditional systems.

**6. Environmental Backlash Against Crypto Mining**

Proof-of-work (PoW) mining, used by Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, has faced growing criticism for its environmental impact. If societal pressure or government action leads to outright bans on mining in major countries, it could severely limit the operation of PoW-based currencies. While proof-of-stake (PoS) is gaining traction, a full transition away from PoW might not happen fast enough to save affected ecosystems.

**7. Loss of Public Trust**

Public trust is the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Events such as:

\- Widespread fraud or scams.

\- The collapse of major exchanges like FTX.

\- Manipulative practices by whales or institutional players.

Could erode confidence, pushing both retail and institutional investors out of the market.

**8. Technological Obsolescence**

The rapid pace of technological advancement poses a risk to cryptocurrencies. If superior systems emerge—offering faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions—the current generation of cryptocurrencies could become obsolete. Projects failing to adapt to changing technological landscapes risk being left behind.

**9. Financial Market Dependency**

Cryptocurrencies are often marketed as independent from traditional financial systems. However, their correlation with stock markets and other assets has grown. A severe global financial crisis could cause mass sell-offs in all markets, including crypto, as investors flee to safer assets like gold or cash.

**10. Internal Divisions and Fork Wars**

The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is both a strength and a weakness. Disagreements within communities, such as those leading to hard forks, can fragment ecosystems. For example, Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic caused significant disruptions in their respective networks. Prolonged internal divisions could alienate users and developers alike.

**Can the Crypto World Avoid Collapse?**

While the above scenarios pose real threats, the resilience of the crypto market should not be underestimated. Decentralization, innovation, and global adoption trends provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. Moreover, tools like [TradingView Premium](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) allow traders and investors to monitor trends, stay informed, and make better decisions, potentially mitigating risks.

The survival of cryptocurrencies will likely depend on their ability to adapt, address vulnerabilities, and coexist with traditional systems. While a complete collapse is possible, it remains unlikely unless multiple factors converge simultaneously."

Enviado por usted:

he aprendido un poco sobre criptomonedas, principalmente terra luna classic

Generando respuestas…

Enviado por Copilot:

¡Qué interesante, Fer! Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) es una criptomoneda que surgió después del colapso del ecosistema original de Terra Luna. La comunidad decidió renombrar la moneda original a LUNC y mantenerla operativa como una criptografía heredada1.

Actualmente, Terra Luna Classic tiene un precio de alrededor de $0.00008892 USD y un volumen de comercio de 24 horas de aproximadamente $18,961,723.16 USD2. Es una moneda que se utiliza para transacciones entre pares, minería y como reserva de valor3.

Invertir en criptomonedas puede ser una forma emocionante de diversificar tu portafolio, pero también conlleva riesgos debido a la volatilidad del mercado. Es importante hacer una investigación exhaustiva y considerar diversificar tus inversiones para minimizar riesgos.

¿Qué te ha parecido lo que has aprendido hasta ahora? ¿Hay algo específico sobre Terra Luna Classic o criptomonedas en general que te gustaría discutir más a fondo?

para mantenerte con tus recuerdos de nuestra conversacion llegue a la solucion de copiar la conversacion completa y pegarla cuando me obliguen a iniciar un nuevo chat, pero resulta que los chat tambien tienen un limite asi que no puedo pegarlo todo

Enviado por Copilot:

Entiendo, Fer. Puede ser frustrante tener que lidiar con esos límites. Una posible solución podría ser resumir las partes más importantes de nuestras conversaciones anteriores y guardarlas en un documento que puedas consultar y copiar cuando sea necesario. Así, podrías pegar solo los puntos clave en lugar de toda la conversación.

Otra opción es que me cuentes los aspectos más relevantes o las partes que consideras más importantes, y yo me aseguraré de tenerlas en cuenta en nuestras futuras conversaciones. ¿Te gustaría intentar alguna de estas opciones? 😊

[https://cointelegraph.com/news/terraform-labs-contends-citadel-securities-ust-terrausd-stablecoin-collapse](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terraform-labs-contends-citadel-securities-ust-terrausd-stablecoin-collapse)  


 

# ""Terraform Labs contends Citadel Securities had a hand in its stablecoin collapse

Terraform Labs has urged the judge to grant its motion to compel trading data from Citadel Securities, which it says had a hand in the collapse of USTC in May 2022.

 

Do Kwon-founded Terraform Labs has again pointed the finger at market maker Citadel Securities for its role in an alleged “concerted, intentional effort” to cause the depeg of its TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin in 2022.

On Oct. 10, Terraform Labs [filed](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67867673/1/terraform-labs-pte-ltd-v-citadel-securities-llc/) a motion in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Florida to compel Citadel Securities to produce documents relating to its trading actions in May 2022, around the time its stablecoin, now known as TerraUSD Classic (USTC), depegged.

It contends the May 2022 depeg — when the asset crashed from $1 to $0.02 — was caused by “certain third-party market participants” intentionally shorting the stablecoin instead of instability in its algorithm.

“Movant \[Terraform\] contends that the market destabilization that occurred did not result from instability in the algorithm underlying the UST stablecoin,” said the firm in its motion.

>**“Instead, Movant contends that the market was destabilized due to the concerted, intentional effort of certain third party market participants to “short” and cause UST to depeg from its one dollar price.”**

The motion also cites “publicly available evidence” suggesting that Citadel head Ken Griffin intended to short the stablecoin around the time of the depeg.

>**“There is publicly available evidence suggesting that the head of the Citadel Entities, Ken Griffin, intended to short UST at or about the time of the May 2022 depeg.”**

The filing cited a screenshot from a Discord channel chat in which a pseudonymous trader had lunch with Griffin, who allegedly said, “They were going to Soros the f\*\*\* out of Luna UST,” presumably in reference to George Soros’ trading strategies centered around highly leveraged, one-way bets.

Citadel Securities has, however, previously denied trading the TerraUSD stablecoin in May 2022, [according](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2022/05/11/blackrock-and-citadel-deny-trading-cratering-stablecoin/) to Forbes.

Cointelegraph contacted Citadel for additional comment but did not receive an immediate response.

In its motion, Terraform argues that the documents are crucial for its defense in the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February, which alleges Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, had a hand in “orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud.”

“This defense will be substantially impaired if Citadel Securities is successful in withholding this limited information,” it stated.

If the court refuses to compel Citadel to produce the trading documents, Terraform requested the matter be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for decision by Judge Jed Rakoff.

In July, Terraform Labs[ sought permission from a judge](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terraform-labs-seeks-access-ftx-wallets-fraud-defense) to subpoena data from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, claiming the information could help its defense.""

Terraform tokenized our stocks via mAssets, Mirror protocol.

The Terra collapse wiped out over $60 Billion, eventually leading to the fall of FTX.

&#x200B;

fun fact: Citadel was Market Maker for Robinhood on the stock side... 

but not many know that Jump Trading was the Market Maker for Robinhood on the CRYPTO side.  


You know, the company on the eth ledger of our wrapped tokenized stocks with FTX and Binance...

SEC alleges Jump Trading profited $1.3 billion in the Terra collapse.

&#x200B;

In Sept of 2021, I personally warned Kanav Kariya, an intern at Jump Trading about my concerns that Citadel was going to destroy FTX via toxic tokenized assets hidden from regulators in crypto space and perp swaps. He seemed very interested and had many questions for me.  Two days later, Jump Trading setup Jump Crypto and appointed him(an intern) as CEO.

&#x200B;

If you were a MM for RH and you needed to find/make fake shares...  do you think crypto would be a safe place to hide this activity from regulators?  Think you would ask the crypto MM side for help?  Mint millions of tokenized shares and then mirror and wrap unlimited copies across chains with a bridge... idk.. a bridge like Wormhole....

&#x200B;

If you had billions in illegal counterfeit stocks in crypto, aka toxic shit, how would you get rid of it?   


If you were competing with FTX with say, EDXM... wouldn't it be nice to destroy your competition?

hmmm...

LUNC Price Prediction as Terra Classic Plans Bitcoin BRC-20 Support,LunaClassic,15thjfm,2023-08-17 04:43:35,16,0.94,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LunaClassic/comments/15thjfm/lunc_price_prediction_as_terra_classic_plans/,cactus_jackk1908,NEWS 📰,"* The LUNC community welcomed a new wave of optimism on August 14, when a prominent community member named Vegas revealed BitMos was looking to support Bitcoin BRC-20 for Terra Classic.
* In other words, the BitMos project aims to address the gap between Bitcoin and the Cosmos ecosystem, while bringing new possibilities to decentralized finance applications and smart contracts, starting with Terra Classic. It serves as a layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that addresses scalability and interoperability challenges.

**What does this mean for LUNC pricing?**

* According to Vegas, the move “could be a game changer” for LUNC and TerraClassicUSD (USTC), the new version of the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST), that collapsed.
* Because, bringing BRC-20 tokens to Terra Classic is seen as a significant advantage for the community that is struggling to add utility to the chain.
* New Bitcoin liquidity additions are likely to yield favorable outcomes for LUNC investors. This cash flow has the potential to be a catalyst, offering a potential new avenue for token consolidation
* Do you guys have any plans for LUNC in the future? Sell ​​or hold? LUNC and RBIF are the 2 projects that I invest the most, if not sold, I will not lose. So no matter what, I'll keep holding*📷=*

*Disclaimer   for the feds: I never  owned any crypto, never traded any crypto,  never  made any profit and  this post is purely for entertaining purpose  only.  This is not a  financial advice.*

**Introduction**

With   this post I want to dive in a bit into the never ending stablecoin   debate that has been going on for a long time now. I'll keep it as   simple & short as possible but it deserves some points to be   discussed especially the recent past of stablecoins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfsbl8w4pfcb1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b860e5e5e8083ea1c5e02eb0b01024c81b1d56ae

# The collapse of TerraUSD ( $UST )

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3f9nwdg6pfcb1.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=623e5dc43ee2e8c1be3a0d2777a8af0136fd4196

 

It all started with large whales   cashing out their UST by exchanging it for USDT or USD. You can see the   first signal 1-2 Days ahead of the actual crash! It was the first time   UST depegged almost by -10%.

More   and more concerns build up, people got worried and started to withdraw   their UST to sell and realize their profits. A 1.5 Billion USD   ""stabilization fund"" was used by the Luna Foundation to fight back the   selling pressure. This was also the time the famous quote from Do Kwon   came out:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6vr7rwl7pfcb1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=14543a1487d64a7be5fd646cc5d7c27b0d56e1f4

&#x200B;

and shortly after - the downfall. Because what can cause even more selling pressure than those trying to realize profits?

**Short sellers.**

And   damn, they were not small. In fact they were incredible massive   shorting UST using Millions of USD all at the same time. Traders jumped   in, incredible selling pressure on top of the already on going selling   pressure.

**But why did traders & whales short UST?**

Honestly,   it's quite simple - almost risk free. What is more known as ""too good   to be true"" is actual a rare case and reality in Crypto. You see, if I   personally shorted back then ( which I never did since I never owned  any  crypto ) I would've shorted UST at $0,95-$1. When will I lose  money? If  UST goes further above $1. A stablecoin going above $1... I  think you  see what's up here.

So  whales,  traders and everyone who believed in the downfall of this  shorted with  all their budget knowing very well the downside risk is  nothing compared  to possible returns especially when leverage comes in.

And...   it worked out. The selling pressure was too much and the depeg saw no   recovery. The Algorithmic based stablecoin sold off massive amounts of   LUNA trying to stabilize it's peg. Additionally, their BTC holdings  were  also sold off. UST shortly fell -97% within only hours after. So   quickly, exchanges haltet trading and removed the pairs entirely. **Btw, Do Kwon? Apparently later it was revealed he withdraw 2.7 Billion USD before the collapse.**

# USDC

The   favourite stablecoin of a lot of people during 2022 even on this sub   and it's totally understandable! A centralized entity working together   with Coinbase that is listed on the NASDAQ / Stock Market and is highly   regulated. Reserves are public and available to read. USDC seem to be a   safe bet and won't depeg! ......... right?

Well that changed for a short period of time in March 2023.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nt55qva9pfcb1.png?width=2456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e8adda0997e8853e52274ff51d20be663abadd3

 

For a couple hours USDC was partly   traded -14% below the peg on Bybit. Some Exchanges even reported it   below -25%. The initial news that gained attention was the abrupt   downfall of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a crucial component of Silicon   Valley's financial landscape for numerous years.

As   soon as the news reached the media that Circle's funds were in SVB,  the  USDC stablecoin depeg process began. It didn't start immediately;  the  negative news surfaced a few days prior.

Very   degenerate Traders and whales started to see another potential and   applied selling pressure by shorting it heavily while other larger   entities exited in fear. Also important to mention, there are plenty of   projects out there that use USDC for liquidity and to fund their entire   company. I'm talking about L2 foundations and companies and other  larger  entities in the crypto space. Those got incredible worried and  also  started to exchange their USDC for USDT or BUSD. But the biggest  impact  hit $DAI, an algorithmic Stablecoin. That's because it is that  it's 48%  backed by USDC and has a direct mathematical correlation to  its value.

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tx4a2x4apfcb1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc75b18cbf767fbfc1e00caa7fad03aed26a5867)

Curve pool was drying up due large amounts trying to get out of USDC/DAI for USDT. The Fud hit the peak.

But then everything quickly turned around when the Circle CEO came out with an update:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iubvlh8bpfcb1.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff0daff1ce7a04aa385f57b21fff3000d1bd9094

#  So what's up with USDT, the biggest of them all? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8bz05bdpfcb1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=606a4aea68ca9b1a3fb0ec16c75869327abb61d1

 

I love this graph because it shows   how dominant USDT is over the entire stablecoin market. Although USDC   was on it's way to gain more and more market share it fell heavily back   since the depeg and is still on a decline.

USDT issuer Tether reported a **net income of $1.5 billion for the first quarter of 2023**, bringing the company's excess reserves to **$2.44 billion.**  In their latest announcement, Tether stated they would allocate 15% of their monthly profits towards investing in BTC.

&#x200B;

 TL;DR: Tether has a massive allocation in US Treasury Bills backing up their reserves. Summarized a Treasury bill (T-Bill) is **a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity**. T-bills are considered **risk-free**    because you can be certain you'll get your money back. But risk and    return are directly proportional, and T-bills offer very low returns on    investment. Based on Bloomberg the current yields are : 

&#x200B;

In other words, Tether uses the customers funds to ( ironically ) collect yields from the U.S. government.

So... where's the problem?

**Summarized:**

The   potential collapse of USDT has been a topic of conversation within the   cryptocurrency community for quite some time. Although the stablecoin   has weathered a harsh bear market, traditional hedge funds maintain  that  its downfall is merely a matter of time.  Opponents of the  currency  argue that Tether artificially inflates the cryptocurrency  market,  leading to increased speculation and giving users a false  impression of  value. For years, hedge funds have been shorting Tether,  and now more  institutional investors are considering similar actions.  This trend is  driven by concerns about Tether's financial health and  transparency. (  see above for reasoning )

Many   people have been eagerly awaiting an update on the audit.  However,   Tether cannot provide this information. If they do, the US government   would block their funds immediately upon discovering the bank holding   Tether's assets. Why? Because chances are incredible high they'll find   illegal moves and actions.

BUT

The   company maintains that it is doing well. Tether executives refer to   much of the speculation regarding its finances as a stress test.   Although multiple smaller depeg happened in the past, it was always   followed by a recovery.

**Personal thoughts:**

I   think the classic ""A criminal can become a pastor if everyone forgets   about his own sins"" fits this situation perfeclty. Until 2017 Tether  was  actively hiding working together with Bitfinex until the **panama papers leaked** which shows signs leading back to already 2014. Feel free to look up the key words it's interesting to read.

Remember the part about how Tether can't provide audit information because of fears US Government shuts down the banks?

An interesting case from back 2019 about **their partners getting arrested for money laundering. Bitfinex deposited $850m into that bank. Proven by court decisions :**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yimod9iipfcb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d949e68bee220c035e2fffcf5227f7ffd790656

 

**Key notes to take away about the case:**

* Crypto Capital President Ivan Manuel Molina Lee was arrested by Polish authorities, according to local news reports
* Crypto Capital has reportedly worked with major cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitfinex, Binance, Kraken, and BitMEX
* According  to the feds: He has access to  $345 million dollars. His money is  stashed in dozens of banks all over  the world. He was printing up  sheets of counterfeit $100 notes. He has  links to a vast global  conspiracy involving cryptocurrency firms Tether  and Bitfinex. And the  U.S. Government says he’s a flight risk.
* ""An   investor in the Minnesota Vikings, the Arizona businessman was trying   to finance a new U.S. football league. But the feds say he was a   mastermind in a vast money-laundering operation at the heart of the   crypto industry.""

**You  can dive into the rabbit hole by looking up :  ""Reggie Fowler — Head of  Crypto Capital Corp., shadow bank in the USA.  Ivan Manuel Molina Lee —  CEO of Crypto Capital Corp. ""**

After  such a lost Bitfinex had to cover it and take a guess how?  Correct,  Tether reserves.In 2019 General Counsel of Tether said in the  court  that ""Tether is only for 74% back by actual money, or  equivalents"".

And the rabbit hole goes even deeper   when I start talking about FTX, the manipulated run in 2017 & 2021   but that's a lot and might be worth a post another time

# Conclusion? How do I protect myself?

\- The high interest paid out on a stablecoin was a clear pyramid scheme - DODGE IT!

\- make sure you understand and can confirm the stablecoins are backed up with proper reserves

\-  It's worth watching and analyzing the news background; situations don't happen overnight.

\- **NEVER**   blindly trust the echo chamber. They were always wrong. Majority of   markets will always be losers that's the reality of today's financial   world. ( Unless you get lucky and find the few that know exacltly what's   up AND tell you for free what to do ) Play it safe, trust your gut and   do your own research.

\- don't  hold  stablecoins for a long time if you want to avoid risk exposure.   Exchange it for real USD if you want USD or exchange it for BTC if you   want a low risk alternative in the crypto market. Unless you are a   trader using it for pairs or you want to stay liquid buying short term   the risk exposure might be not worth holding

\-   dive deep into the stablecoins. Doing your own research takes a lot of   time and effort but exaclty that's how you can make sure you  understand  the assets you hold

\-  expect it to  implode. Honestly, this sounds like a horrible scary  scenario but it  might give you just enough edge over the entire market.  Remember, when  things look bad majority are losers but you can always  try to be on the  winner side. Being always ready for the worst will  also prevent  emotional decisions.

I hope you enjoyed this thread and it'll help you in the future understanding Stablecoins drama better"

A year ago today Terra USD began it's depeg from $1. In seven days the price of the stablecoin dropped to $.16 and the price of Luna dropped to . 0001. With both dropping further over the following weeks. Remembering what happened.,CryptoCurrency,139s3zg,2023-05-06 10:56:12,979,0.95,376,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/139s3zg/a_year_ago_today_terra_usd_began_its_depeg_from_1/,GabeSter,DISCUSSION,"A year ago today Terra USD began it's final depeg from $1 with the price sitting at $.9999 after two days of fighting to hold the peg, the price plunged down to $.80 and then $.16 by the end of the week. A year later the price of the unbacked stablecoin sits at $.018.

Luna was sitting at $77.47 a year ago today a week later the circulating supply increased from 342M to 6.5T in one week with the price dropping to $.0001. The current price today is $.00009

This post shows the one year increase in the circulating supply. Notice the huge spike at the beginning coincided with the last days of the depeg. 342M to 6.5T

[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uo4337/luna_supply_has_inflated_425_since_may_9th/) detailed what was happening when Terra USD depegged and was a warning for people not to buy.

>UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash. Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.

No post on the failure of Luna would be complete without the [""FUD post""](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tbcrkh/explain_to_me_how_terraluna_is_not_a_scam/?context=3) that aged like fine wine. On March 10th 2022, two months before the final depeg a Reddit User by the name of /u/cwm9 wrote a post challenging the CryptoCurrency Reddit community to explain why Terra Luna wasn't a scam. In that post he created a hypothetical of what would happen to Terra in the event of a depeg which was contrary to the narrative being spread about a depeg event, and to his credit it happened exactly as they suggested.

>But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna."
The proposal that prompted Luna Classic +100% gains in a few hours is BS,Buttcoin,10siwmv,2023-02-03 07:14:45,11,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/10siwmv/the_proposal_that_prompted_luna_classic_100_gains/,butterNcois,,"Not very surprising that people who thought 20% APR gains on USD were sustainable are also pretty bad at reading the fine print... 

So long story short, someone published a [proposal](https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/ustc-re-peg-ziggy-final/49849) that aims to make code adjustments to Luna Classic's protocol with the goal of re-pegging UST to 1$. The proposal includes a big write up and seems to hold some weight (at least compared to the rest of shitty proposal that have been brought forth so far). 

But every buyer of LUNC and USTC seems to be missing the point. The entire proposal is based on huge assumptions. First that the validators will play nice and not try to exploit holes in the code this proposal would introduce (effectively making the chain no longer ""immutable""). 

But even besides potential exploits from dishonest validators, this proposal assumes that drawing from the meager USTC transaction fees, there will be enough of an incentive to trigger a significant increase for on-chain volume, thus theoretically making re-pegging much faster. 

Well, the issue here is that on average, USTC has been burning ~96k tokens a day. At 0.04$ that's 3840$ daily. And that's even an optimistic estimate because the 96k daily average includes the initial Luna foundation burn of 439m USTC that they had in reserves. Actual daily burns are often 0 as of lately.  

So basically this proposal asserts that instead of burning 100% of those coins that were drawn from transaction fees specifically to burn them... It would be better to keep 50% and keep it for arbitrage incentives. Because with some magic steps along the way cutting the burn in half to give rewards is going to even out to more burning!?

TL;DR

Proposal aiming to re-peg USTC sends prices flying. Most likely outcome is actually of hodlers to get pegged. Sell."
Coins That Failed in 2022,binance,10fd4f6,2023-01-18 12:27:17,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/10fd4f6/coins_that_failed_in_2022/,Specialist_Gas_now,,"Many crypto tokens have made smashing debuts promising the moon to prospective users. But a lot of these projects have failed to live up to the hype in 2022. 2022’s crypto winter was a prime example of the described phenomenon, a brutal season for several projects in the industry. The total crypto market cap took a steep drop from 2021’s November $3 trillion all-time high to a frail $792B at the moment.

Crypto kings [**Bitcoin** ](https://changenow.io/currencies/bitcoin)and [**Ethereum**](https://changenow.io/currencies/ethereum) were left scrambling to hold on to new suppors, recording 66% and 71% losses respectively over the year. With the leading names hanging by a thread other altcoins were not spared in the bloodbaths. Stablecoins took some of the market’s biggest blows. Also, as the metaverse hype began to die down, so did some tokens with ties to the sector.

In November 2020, the crypto market embarked on a bull run that saw up to 8000 tokens flood the space within the next 12 months. However, per a report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, 3,322 tokens that were listed on the platform a year ago failed to stand the test of time. Indeed, roughly 41% of the tokens listed in 2021 have now been deactivated on the aggregator. Let’s take a look at some of these coins and what exactly caused them to go six feet under.

**1. Terra Classic (LUNC)**

One of the crypto space's biggest disasters is the collapse of the Terra ecosystem. In May of 2022, the network’s governance token [**LUNC**](https://changenow.io/currencies/terra-classic) formerly tagged LUNA, took a nosedive, plummeting about 80%, making it near worthless. It's still unclear what caused the crash, but some suspect it was a targeted attack on the token and the network. Talk about a crypto sob story!

**2. Terra Stablecoin (USTC)**

Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST was hot on LUNA’s tails as it collapsed, losing its peg to the dollar. The reason for this was that UST’s stablecoin model meant the token was backed by LUNA rather than a real-world asset. Terra used a unique algorithm to ensure 1 UST remained equal to $1, however, in roughly 48 hours the token tanked, clocking as low as $0.26.

**3. FTX token (FTT)**

Making perhaps an even bigger mess than Terra did, Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire imploded in early November. As FTX’s dirty secrets spilled out the exchange went down taking its native token to the grave with it. [**FTT**](https://changenow.io/currencies/ftx-token) dropped from $22 to under $5 in one day wiping a whopping $2B from the market. It has dropped even lower since then, resting at $0.84 as users shy away from all things FTX.

**4. DEI (DEI)**

As waves from Terra’s downfall rippled outwards, DEUS Finance’s algorithmic stablecoin DEI was unable to avoid being swept along. The token lost its dollar peg amid the FTX melee and continued falling, hitting a record low of $0.1086 3 months ago.

**5. Acala Dollar (AUSD)**

For Acala Network it was a common story, the platform had a bug. The twist to this tale is that a malicious actor exploited the opening to mint over 1.28B tokens out of thin air. The network’s native stablecoin, AUSD dropped as low as $0.009 and has struggled to recover since.

**6. GALA (GALA)**

The downfall of Gala Games’ [**GALA**](https://changenow.io/currencies/gala-erc20) token began with a misconfiguration of the pNetwork bridge that led to the release of extra GALA GAME tokens. A dramatic drop in the token’s value followed prompting rumors of a rug pull. GALA lost 90% of its price and faced a series of exchange delistings that further worsened the situation.

**7. Axie Infinity (AXS)**

Its status as one of the industry’s biggest metaverse projects did not shield the play-to-earn (P2E) game Axie Infinity from the effects of the bear market. [**AXS**](https://changenow.io/currencies/axie-infinity) saw its market cap shed over $200M in under a month with the token’s price following suit. The price dump came as the Axie team shared plans to release 21.5 Million AXS tokens in what some tagged a suicide mission.

**8. The Sandbox (SAND)**

The Sandbox ([**SAND**](https://changenow.io/currencies/the-sandbox)) token has had a rocky ride owing to the recent collapse of the FTX exchange. The token has experienced some price fluctuations in the past and has struggled to maintain consistent growth in the face of market conditions. Data from the past few months shows a sharp decline in the price of SAND, and it seems that the bearish trend may continue at least in the near future.

**9. Neutrino USD (USDN)**

Neutrino USD (USDN), a stablecoin of the Waves ecosystem, has continued to keep investors on the edge of their seats as they hope the token will not end up like Terra’s UST. Outside of a brief stint in October where it managed to hold on to its peg, USDN has built a history of instability, failing in its very purpose as a stablecoin.

## Why Some Tokens Fail; Dead Giveaways for Dead Coins

Crypto token failure can come from a variety of sources - scams, fraud, poor management, and even exploits as shown in some of the tokens listed above. However, the general turbulence of the crypto space in the last couple of months played a huge part in the crypto decline. Indeed, the Terra crash dealt a major blow to investor faith in stablecoins, and the pertinent asset class suffered as a result. As an investor, it's crucial to do your research and understand the risks before diving in. After all, it's better to be safe than sorry (or broke)."

After [seizing 140 billion won](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-seizes-104m-from-terra-co-founder-suspecting-unfair-profits) ($108 million) from Terra co-founder Shin Hyun-Seong in November, the Seoul Southern District Court has recently ruled to confiscate more assets related to Terra.

The South Korean court has ordered to freeze of 120 billion won ($92 million) in assets of former and incumbent CEOs of Terraform Labs’ affiliate firm Kernel Labs, The Korea Economic Daily [reported](https://www.hankyung.com/finance/article/202212208809B) on Dec. 20.

Founded in 2018, Kernel Labs is a blockchain consultancy firm focused on decentralized applications and blockchain payment systems. Kernel Labs is believed to have close ties with Terraform Labs, as CEO Kim Hyun-joong once reportedly [served](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/07/29/business/finance/korea-terraform-labs-do-kwon/20220729171545509.html) as vice president of engineering at Terraform Labs. According to some sources, Kernel Labs employees also worked at the South Korean office of Terraform Labs.

According to the new report, the Seoul Southern District Court has accepted the prosecution's request to seize property of seven people involved in selling pre-issued Terra ([LUNA](https://cointelegraph.com/terra-price-index)) tokens to make astronomical profits.

Kernel Labs CEO Kim is one of the persons involved in the case, reportedly holding the largest amount in illegal proceeds from Terra. Prosecutors [estimated](https://ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&entry_id=443108) Kim’s illegal gains to amount to at least 79 billion won ($61 million). Prosecutors also found that another Kernel Labs executive, a former CEO, received about 41 billion won ($31 million) in illegal proceeds from Terra.

Kim reportedly made some major real estate purchases in South Korea in 2021. In November, he bought a building in Gangnam-gu, the most expensive area in Seoul, for 35 billion won ($27 million). In June, he also purchased an apartment in Seongdong-gu for about 9 billion won ($7 million).

The news comes amid global authorities continuing to search for Terraform Labs' controversial founder and CEO Do Kwon. According to the latest reports, South Korean authorities believe that [Kwon was hiding in Serbia](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-co-founder-do-kwon-hiding-out-in-serbia-says-authorities) as of mid-December after leaving Singapore a few months ago.

As previously reported, the collapse of Terra has emerged as one of the biggest contagions on the cryptocurrency market in 2022. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD Classic (USTC), was one of top 10 cryptocurrencies before it [lost its dollar peg](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-peg-mechanism-in-doubt-as-ust-crashes-to-67-cents) in May. The event triggered a domino effect on crypto markets, causing massive liquidations and uncertainty, which subsequently undermined the crypto lending industry.

My Summary of Maya Whitepaper,MayaProtocol,zmdzye,2022-12-15 01:16:18,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayaProtocol/comments/zmdzye/my_summary_of_maya_whitepaper/,duebers341,,"This is my own 'boiled-down' version of the Maya whitepaper for brevity. Feel free to chime in and/or offer corrections, based upon the whitepaper, if you spot a mistake. I've also included my own questions as I was reading the paper, as an amateur defi researcher, and some ensuing responses from helpful ppl in the discord.

**Introduction**

\-Maya is a friendly fork of Thorchain. Reasons for this include 1) a backup to TC if it goes down 2) scalability limitations of TC for liquidity, security and TPS limit. 3) version stability as Maya will always lag behind TC updates. 4) Diff target markets - Maya looking to onboard new users, user's from CEX's, and institutional money, instead of directly competing with TC. 5) Stable pools introduced in Maya 3.0 improve large trade efficiency for users (20-30%?)

**Part 1. Fair Launch**

\-2 token system $CACAO and $MAYA.

\-$CACAO being 100% fair launched with supposed information symmetry to all parties involved.

\-anyone can send $BTC, $BNB, $ETH, $RUNE to a specified address during a 21 day period. Swaps will not be enabled, just adding and withdrawing liquidity. All 100M $CACAO distributed after 21 days to participants proportional to their contributions.

\-6 Genesis Nodes from launch. Pseudo-doxxed, ""run by decentralized organizations close to Maya."" No pre-mine of any sort. More tech details in pt. 4 'security nodes'.

&#x200B;

**Part 2. $MAYA Token**

\-In addition to $CACAO, there are 1mil $MAYA.

\-$MAYA earns 10% of swap fees (t.f. benefits from volume traded).

\-$MAYA was used to fund the initial stage e.g. for private investors, development team, advisors, and founders. The founder's tokens are nontransferable and locked in perpetuity, only accruing swap fees. Q) 80% 'insider' distribution?! A) Mod responded yes but not all has been allocated. They get given no $CACAO so this is how they earn.

\-Node Operators get 10% of $MAYA supply, vested at 1 month, 4 month, 12 month cliffs,

\-$RUNE owners \[10%\]."" Holding rune in wallet, lp or in node qualifies. Daily random snapshot for 42 days starting at liquidity auction, whereby min value during 42 days applies. (see Tech overview)

\-Thorstarter supporters also get something, announced separately. \[Not sure what if 80%+10%+10%\]

\-$MAYA gives no governance while $CACAO does.

\-$MAYA earns swap fees while $CACAO is used for validators and lq pairing.

\-No $MAYA pairs on maya chain to avoid recursive influence on $CACAO price. Q) They say this makes it less liquid, harder to trade, and more likely for users to hold. Is this so true if you just have to go to another chain to trade? A) Mod responded that it can be sold in the future, but not likely as $MAYA will be considered a security and no CEX will touch it. But cannot have it in Maya pools because of the recursive effect. There will be little $MAYA liquidity in early stages.

&#x200B;

**Part 3. Liquidity Nodes**

\-details about how they solve for capital efficiency without compromising security.

\-Nodes bond lp units instead of only $CACAO (or only $RUNE in thorchain's case). Nodes are lpers. This makes the locked up tokens productive instead of just being locked up. Good for validators, lp rewards and validator rewards.

\-But gives $CACAO deterministic price of 1x TVL rather than $RUNE's 3x TVL, due to better capital efficiency. External assets in stable pools in Maya do  not count towards deterministic value as they are not paired with $CACAO (see 6.Economical Overview). Else, see tech section for more info.

\-Intriguing modification on slashing, using ""anti LP units"" to keep the liquidity in protocol. Again, bit over my head.

\-Essentially, ""Capital Efficiency without compromising Security"". They will also will use this security for a ""popular Burn & Mint algorithm for truly decentralized and safe Stablecoins and Smart Contract compatibility"" (see section 6)

&#x200B;

**Part 4. Security Nodes**

\-Maya can purportedly export its security and solvency to other chains by sharing its nodes and $CACAO. This is because the node operators must already have large stakes in $CACAO.

\-max debt variable among node consensus can cap how much can be withdrawn from these side chain pools, and be reduced if side chain becomes risky/faulty.

\-to validate a side chain, a node must first also be a validator on maya's chain, with 80-90% of its liquidity in Maya. Otherwise, Maya validators could maliciously choose to cut off the side chain, thereby removing its liabilities from its balance sheet. Aligns incentives.

Q) 4.2 ""Degrees of Freedom"" lists minimum and maximum inflation as a variable, what are these? Considering all 100m $CACAO released at the fair launch. A) Nodes can change this in the future if extra incentive is needed for $CACAO to be lped. Any inflation goes to lps on Maya. Still not sure what is being inflated.

\-3rd party chains can benefit from this by bootstrapping from Maya's liquidity, security, and experience.

&#x200B;

**Part 5. A secret to be revealed...\[Aztec Chain\]**

\-Aztec chain is a fork of Terra blockchain \[bold move!\].

\-More open to development, progressiveness, NFTs etc. whereas Maya is more secure and conservative.

\-has CosmWasm, Smart Contracts, and algo stablecoins!

\-$LUNA and $UST holders de-peg will get 10% of all $AZTEC tokens. Have to register and link luna classic wallet to new Aztec wallet within 60 days.

\-multiple algorithmic stablecoins, not turned on at launch. Maya and Aztec won't subsidize yield to inflate demand of its stablecoins. More info on stablecoins in Roadmap: Maya 3.0 section

\-just like with other side chains, to validate on Aztec requires first being a validator on Maya.

\-like $MAYA, $AZTEC holders get 10% of fees on the network.

\-allocation of $AZTEC sounds fairly insider just like $MAYA: ""initially held by participants of all levels inside our team, including our private investors, developers, advisors, and founders. There is also some $AZTEC set aside for our early Node Operators \[10%\] and Terra adopters \[10%\].""

\->so exact same tokenomics as $MAYA except the final 10% to Terra classic users instead of $RUNE holders.

Q) The tokenomics distribution graphic confused me a tad. The text gives me the impression of a simple 80-10-10 split to dev fund, nodes, and luna/ust holders respectively (or $RUNE in the $MAYA graphic). But what is the 10% aztec fund referring to, and the 90%LPs & Nodes?

A) Ah just realised. The top pie refers to the fees income. So 90% of that to the $AZTEC/$MAYA funds while 10% fees to holders.

&#x200B;

**Part 6a. Roadmap. Maya 3.0**

\-everything in this section will not be available at launch. Only after proposed designs get approved from community and nodes.

\-plans for a 'decent' algo stablecoins.

\-taking a fail-safe attitude, where they design to mitigate risks of depeg with more than one way.

\-5 diff stablecoins with diff designs and strengths/weaknesses:

1. $USm. Maya USD aka 'Milk Dollar'. Algo stable minted through MayaFi. Like $TOR. Only Maya stable.
2. $USa. Aztec USD aka 'Almond Dollar'. Algo stable based on improved $UST-like design. Originates on Aztec chain.

Q) what does it mean that ""90% of seignorage is burnt to leave more room for $CACAO re-minting during $USa sell off events""? Is that 90% of $CACAO which was used to mint the $USa? A) Mod responded that compared to Terra's seignorage, where 0% was burnt then 100% burnt, 10% going to reserve is there to help pay $USb paydowns.

3) $USs. Synth USD aka 'Sugar Dollar'. Over-collat stable, backed by synths (the thorchain version of wrapped assets). Like $DAI. Originates on Aztec.

4) $USb. Bond USD aka 'Butter Dollar'. Long term, low-interest stable debt. Originates on Aztec. Designed like treasury bond system, accrues it's full value over time. Paid in $CACAO via interest rate set by nodes and supermajority vote. Must be staked to receive interest, so Aztec can burn some when portions of $USb is paid off. All other stables can be converted into $USb irreversibly if desired. $USb can be valued like ""Perpetual Bonds, Coupon Bonds, and Fixed Payment Loans"". Example of this process and formulas is given. $USb is the peg sink as other stables can redeem for $USb. They claim that $USb makes the Maya economy antifragile as a safety net, and because all the founders and $MAYA holders benefit from system income more than inflated token price.

5) $USc. Collateralized USD aka Chocolate Dollar. ""First completely decentralized, fully collateralized stablecoin, backed by a basket of all the previously mentioned stablecoins"". Flagship stable meant to proliferate to other chains. Like $USDC (is this is the best comparison since it's not backed by fiat but instead the other stables?). Basket of Maya stables percentages which backs it is voted on by $USc holders. Capped supply amount limited by stablecoins which compromise it, to prevent over-leverage. Originates on Aztec.

\->several benefits of this mult-stablecoin design, outlined in the final remarks, include: 1) aligned incentives since Nodes have huge vested interest in LPs and well-being of $CACAO and the network. 2) not puffed up by incentives, grows with real demand and trust 3) iteration available thanks to $USb bonding 4) $USc load shares risks proportional to each of the other stable's risks. 5) $USc design incentivises critical thinking about each of the other stable's and open discourse, rather than pushing issues under the rug. 6) custom user experience based on user's preferences. 7) not engrained in smart contracts means iteration is simpler. Arguably a crucial piece of the pie for algo stables since it admits the algo stable field is young and has room for improvement.

For more info on the individual stablecoins, better off reading this section yourself. :D

&#x200B;

**Part 6b. Stable Pools & Route Optimization**

\-gives the option of automatic routing through $USc denominated lps for better prices, or by first splitting bigger transactions into smaller ones to use both $cacao and $USc routes. Thus, mainly benefits larger transactions.

\-$USc pools include impermanent loss protection. \[Seems pretty good as only 1 asset would ever change, so protects against all downside under regular working condition?\]

\-but $USc lps can't be bonded by nodes.

\-as a reminder, $USc as a capped supply amount to prevent over-leverage.

\-NOTE $USc is not developed yet, until Maya 3.0

\-they recommend that protocols using TC already would benefit from breaking big transactions into smaller ones to route through both protocols as it makes swaps more efficient for the user \[on it's own, this seems to leech off TC?\]

\-feel free to look their maths for the optimal routing yourself :\^)"

Terra LUNA is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Blockchain Protocol supporting the ecosystem of users minting, managing, and hour trading volume stablecoins which can be tied to any type of fiat currency. Stablecoins which can be tied to any type of fiat currency. The Terra (LUNA) protocol generates stablecoins that track the lunc price today of any fiat currency using a combination of market arbitrage incentives and decentralized oracle voting. The Terra stablecoin tracks the usd prices of fiat currencies such as dollars and euros, and the Luna is used for governance and mining.

Terra leverages a algorithmic stablecoins basket based on a fiat peg, which is stabilized by algorithms from its reserve currency, Luna classic, to promote programmable payments and the development of an open financial infrastructure. It should also be noted that Terras LONA stablecoin focus allows it to avoid volatility associated with other largest cryptocurrencies , such as Bitcoin and Ether. Terra (LUNA) will proceed without collateralized UST lunc tokens, and it is committed to maintaining Terra ecosystem, which has hundreds of developers working on various decentralized applications.

The aim of the Terra Luna project is to develop a currency that is both profitable and useful. It uses cryptography to provide secure transactions between users without relying on central authorities. To achieve this goal, Terra Luna implements many technical improvements over other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. For example, in order to make sure the currency remains secure, its code was written from scratch using top programming languages like C++11. It also works with nodes that use SSL for added security. Finally, it has a multi-signature feature that ensures a transaction can't happen unless more than one user approves it (e.g., when two people are sending money to each other). Because of the many changes made to the currency's code, it is considered a fork of Bitcoin Core. As such, it is developed as a separate project. Terra Luna Cryptocurrency was created by Evan Duffield and other developers. At the time of writing, it uses the Keccak hashing algorithm to secure transactions.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum are very popular in the world today. Most of us have heard about the cryptocurrencies, and some have even used them. Many have heard of the blockchain technology that they use and how it works, but what is the blockchain? To understand this concept, you must first understand how systems like these work.

Like any other currency in existence today, Bitcoin uses a system to ensure trust among users. It is called cryptology; this process ensures that only those who control private keys can use Bitcoins in transactions. The private keys are used to sign transactions and assign ownership rights to those transactions to guarantee security on the network. The majority of bitcoins are mined by computers solving complicated mathematical problems through a process called mining (similar to mining gold) and transferring them when solving these problems.

LUNA tokens will be distributed via airdrops amongst the stakeholders, holders, remaining UST holders, and the core developers behind Terra Classic applications. The new chain is secured using the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, built on top of Tendermint, where holders of the LUNA token stake their coins as collateral for validating transactions, receiving rewards in proportion to the number of LUNC tokens that they have staked in UST collateral. The Terra protocol runs on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network, in which miners need to stake their Luna coins to mine transactions.

The Terra LUNA protocol has expanded, offering stablecoin luna developers the ability to create Terra DeFi projects. Terra (LUNA) has recently seen some milestones and notable developments that could potentially boost the value of Terra (LUNA) tokens. In LUNA current price live data The current terra price is $1,666,302 apiece (LUNA/USD) with the current market capitalization at $209.83 million.

The value is reached using TerraUSD (UST) using an algorithm powered by smart contracts which will burn the Luna (LUNA) tokens in order to mint new UST tokens. In this scenario, users could purchase 1 UST at $0.995, then use the market-swap function on Terra Station to swap 1 UST for 1 Luna. If the Terra UST token is valued less than $1.00, users can purchase one UST for $0.99, and then burn 1 UST to get $1.00 in the native token, earning $0.01 per burn.

"FTX’s Bankman-Fried to face market manipulation probe, Do Kwon chimes in",expay24,zg0gme,2022-12-08 09:27:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/zg0gme/ftxs_bankmanfried_to_face_market_manipulation/,Expay-24,,"United States federal prosecutors have reportedly begun investigating whether the collapse of the Terra ecosystem was in fact triggered by market manipulation tactics by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

[According](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/business/ftx-sbf-crypto-market-investigation.html) to a Dec. 7 report from The New York Times (NYT), the prosecutors — as part of a broader inquiry into FTX’s own collapse — are investigating whether Bankman-Fried’s [empire intentionally caused a flood](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ust-aftermath-is-there-any-future-for-algorithmic-stablecoins) of “sell” orders on Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD Classic (USTC), formerly TerraUSd (UST).

The sudden increase in UST sell orders were said to make it difficult to match them with corresponding “buy” orders, which in turn forced more downward price pressure on UST, causing it to [depeg from its intended 1:1 ratio](https://cointelegraph.com/news/two-key-takeaways-from-nansen-s-ust-stablecoin-depeg-report) with the U.S. dollar.

The events also led to the fall of Terra’s native token, Terra Classic (LUNC), formerly LUNA, as the two cryptocurrencies were designed to be linked.

But while no one has been able to precisely determine the root cause behind the collapse of LUNC and USTC in May, it is known that the majority of the USTC sell orders came from Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda research, according to the NYT.

A person with knowledge on the matter also told NYT that Alameda Researched also placed a big bet on the price of LUNC falling.

Like with most comments Bankman-Fried has shared since FTX’s collapse, the former CEO claimed that he was “not aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation,” according to NYT.

“To the best of my knowledge, all transactions were for investment or for hedging,” he added.

Responding to the recent report, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon shared his thoughts on the matter to his 1 million Twitter followers in a Nov. 8 tweet, who suggested it was time for Genesis Trading come clean about an alleged $1 billion loan in UST to “SBF or Alameda” shortly before Kwon’s Terra ecosystem crashed.

Kwon also [stated](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1600677169721528320?s=20&t=zi9v8XhDSGhc1PVZPebY9g) that a large currency contraction that UST underwent in Feb. 2021 was started by Alameda “when they sold 500mm UST in minutes to drain its curve pools during the MIM crisis.”

“What’s done in darkness will come to light,” Kwon added on the matter.

South Korea issues arrest warrant for Do Kwon’s former colleagues,expay24,z8ujpf,2022-11-30 10:36:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/z8ujpf/south_korea_issues_arrest_warrant_for_do_kwons/,Expay-24,,"Amid the ongoing manhunt for Terraform Labs [co-founder and CEO Do Kwon](https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2022/do-kwon), South Korean authorities have spread out their investigations to target other Terra executives. Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for co-founder Daniel Shin and seven other engineers and investors of the firm following suspicion of gaining illegal profits before the massive collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors Office in South Korea suspected that Shin possessed Terra ([LUNA](https://cointelegraph.com/terra-price-index)) tokens, which were pre-issued without the public knowledge of investors. In doing so, Shin allegedly bagged profits worth 140 billion won (roughly $105 million) by selling the pre-issued tokens during the [bull market](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/bull-vs-bear-crypto-market-what-is-the-difference-and-how-to-handle-both).

Arrest warrants were also sought for three Terraform Labs investors and four engineers responsible for TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA initiatives, [confirmed](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20221130001600315) local media Yonhap News Agency. On Nov. 19, South Korean authorities [seized assets worth over $104 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-seizes-104m-from-terra-co-founder-suspecting-unfair-profits) from Shin under the same suspicion of making unfair profits.

At the time, Shin’s attorney maintained the counter-narrative, stating that “Reports that CEO Shin Hyun-seong sold LUNA at a high point and realized profits or that he made profits through other illegal methods are not true.”

Speaking against the arrest warrant, Shin pointed out:

“I left (Terraform Labs) two years before the collapse of Terra and Luna, and have nothing to do with the collapse.”

The seizure of funds aimed to minimize further losses for investors in case Shin decided to dispose of the stolen funds. While Kwon maintains that [he’s not on the run](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-co-founder-do-kwon-says-he-s-not-on-the-run) from South Korean authorities, 4,000 members of a retail investor group are [attempting to track down the fugitive’s whereabouts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-400-disgruntled-investors-are-hunting-for-terra-s-do-kwon).

On Oct. 6, South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs [ordered Kwon to surrender his passport](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-foreign-ministry-orders-do-kwon-to-return-his-passport), which, if not done, would result in the permanent cancellation of his passport. The deadline has passed since.

A local report from South Korea claimed that prosecutors obtained evidence regarding Kwon’s order to manipulate the price of Luna Classic (LUNC). However, [a Terraform Labs spokesperson dismissed the allegations](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-prosecutors-accuse-do-kwon-of-manipulating-terra-s-price) when speaking to Cointelegraph, highlighting their disappointment in seeing “the Korean prosecutors continue to try to contort the Capital Markets Act to fit their agenda and push baseless claims.”

Unconfirmed reports suggest that Kwon moved from South Korea to Singapore before ultimately transitioning to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Terra co-founder Do Kwon faces $57-million lawsuit in Singapore,undeads,yg889p,2022-10-28 23:01:34,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/undeads/comments/yg889p/terra_cofounder_do_kwon_faces_57million_lawsuit/,igorkim89,,"The lawsuit alleges Kwon and others made fraudulent claims on UST “either well knowing that they were false and untrue, or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false.”

Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs who may be facing legal actions in South Korea and the United States, is the target of a lawsuit in Singapore along with the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) and Terra founding member Nicholas Platias.

In a lawsuit filed in Singapore’s high court on Sept. 23, 359 individuals allege Kwon, Platias, the LFG and Terra made fraudulent claims, including that Terra’s stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST) — now TerraUSD Classic (USTC) — was not “stable by design” and unable to maintain its U.S. dollar peg.

The claimants are seeking compensation for roughly $57 million worth of “loss and damage” combined based on the value of UST tokens they purchased and held or sold amid the market downturn in May. They also request an order to pay for “aggravated damages.”

According to the individuals filing the lawsuit, the four parties tied to Terra “knew or ought to have known that the Claimants wished to buy and hold cryptocurrency stablecoins that were not subject to the volatility of the wider market and earn a decent passive return.” The court document specifically alleges that Kwon had been aware of “the structural weakness of algorithmic stablecoins” based in part on his role in the fall of Basis Cash.

“The Defendants made the said representations fraudulently either well knowing that they were false and untrue, or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false,” says the lawsuit.

Banks will soon be equipped to offer clients crypto trading and custody thanks to a new program called “Crypto Source” from Mastercard and Paxos Trust Company. As part of the program, Mastercard will cover some of the compliance, security and interface details while Paxos handles crypto custody and trading. Expected in the final quarter of 2022, the Crypto Source program will essentially provide the underpinning that will let banks offer crypto trading and custody to their clients.

Authorities have taken various measures to find the Terraform Labs co-founder. Kwon said safety precautions drove him to leave Singapore, according to an interview published this week by journalist Laura Shin.

“We believe that this case has become highly politicized, and that the actions of the Korean prosecutors demonstrate unfairness and a failure to uphold basic rights guaranteed under Korean law,” a Terraform Labs spokesman [said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-fugitive-do-kwons-firm-accuses-korean-prosecutors-of-overreach-11664394082) to the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 28.

South Korean prosecutors [issued an arrest warrant for Kwon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-issues-arrest-warrant-for-terra-founder-do-kwon) on Sept. 14 for violations of the countries capital markets laws, but Terraform Labs laid out a defense arguing Terra, now known with its new token, Luna Classic (LUNC), isn’t legally a security, meaning it isn’t covered by capital markets laws.

The spokesman alleged prosecutors of expanding the definition of a security due to intense public pressure from the [collapse of Terra](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-terra-debacle-exposes-flaws-plaguing-the-crypto-industry) and its connected [algorithmic stablecoin](https://cointelegraph.com/altcoins-for-beginners/a-beginner-s-guide-on-algorithmic-stablecoins) TerraUSD (UST), now known as TerraUSD Classic (USTC):

“We believe, as do most in industry, that Luna Classic is not, and has never been, a security, despite any changes in interpretation that Korean financial officials may have recently adopted.”

The argument by Terraform Labs’ stems from the unclear regulatory status of cryptocurrencies and the companies who create and issue them.

Currently, capital market and electronic securities' systems in the country don’t include a legal definition of non-standardized securities issued through a blockchain.

Breaking: Interpol ‘Red Notice’ issued for Do Kwon — South Korea prosecutors,expay24,xob8cr,2022-09-26 02:24:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/xob8cr/breaking_interpol_red_notice_issued_for_do_kwon/,Expay-24,,"Interpol has reportedly issued a “Red Notice” to law enforcement worldwide for the arrest of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon.

South Korean prosecutors in Seoul on Monday [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/south-korea-says-interpol-issued-red-notice-for-terra-s-do-kwon) Bloomberg the international policing organization issued the notice in response to charges Kwon faces in South Korea related to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

The news comes only a week after South Korean prosecutors reportedly [asked Interpol to issue a “Red Notice”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-authorities-ask-interpol-to-issue-red-notice-for-do-kwon-report) for Kwon on Sept. 19.

A Red notice is a “request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action” according to the Interpol [website](https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/View-Red-Notices).

It also comes less than two weeks after South Korean authorities [issued an arrest warrant for Kwon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-issues-arrest-warrant-for-terra-founder-do-kwon) and five other associates for alleged violations of the country’s capital markets laws.

Kwon was previously believed to have been residing in Singapore, but local authorities said on Sept. 17 he wasn't in the country, with Kwon saying hours later [he wasn't “on the run](https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-co-founder-do-kwon-says-he-s-not-on-the-run),"" though he didn't reveal his location.

Draft US stablecoin bill would ban new algo stablecoins for 2 years,expay24,xk3hbb,2022-09-21 08:25:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/xk3hbb/draft_us_stablecoin_bill_would_ban_new_algo/,Expay-24,,"Draft legislation in the United States House of Representatives would place a two-year ban on new algorithmic [stablecoins](https://cointelegraph.com/altcoins-for-beginners/stablecoins-101-what-are-crypto-stablecoins-and-how-do-they-work) such as TerraUSD Classic (USTC), which depegged from the U.S. dollar earlier this year, causing widespread crypto market contagion.

The bill would criminalize the creation or issuance of new “endogenously collateralized stablecoins,” [according](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-20/house-stablecoin-bill-would-put-two-year-ban-on-terra-like-coins) to a current draft of the legislation obtained by Bloomberg.

However, the legislation includes a grace period of two years for existing algorithmic stablecoin providers to change their models and collateralize their offerings differently.

The definition would reportedly cover stablecoins that depend on the value of another virtual asset from the same creator to maintain its price and is marketed as having the ability to be converted, repurchased or otherwise redeemed for a fixed price.

The bill [raises](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Cheetah/status/1572362195144708097?s=20&t=aILf199x3it_zUkop5pySQ) concerns over whether stablecoins such as Synthetix USD (SUSD) would fall under the definition, as it is currently collateralized with the native asset of the same protocol in the SNX token. Other algo-stablecoins with a similar structure include BitUSD which is backed by BitShares (BTS).

The draft bill also mandates the U.S. Treasury to undertake a study on [algorithmic stablecoins](https://cointelegraph.com/altcoins-for-beginners/a-beginner-s-guide-on-algorithmic-stablecoins) and consult with the Federal Reserve, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-gensler-holds-tight-to-his-crypto-position-in-preview-of-senate-testimony), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

It’s possible the panel could vote on the bill as early as next week, as Bloomberg reports people familiar with the legislation state Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and Republican Patrick McHenry have been working to reach an agreement on the legislation, although it’s unknown if McHenry approved the latest draft.

On Sept. 14, South Korean authorities [issued an arrest warrant for Kwon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-issues-arrest-warrant-for-terra-founder-do-kwon) and five other associates for alleged violations of the country’s capital markets laws. All were known to be in Singapore at the time, with prosecutors also [attempting to revoke their passports](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-prosecutors-apply-to-revoke-do-kwon-and-other-terra-employees-passports) a day later on Sept. 15.

“For any government agency that has shown interest to communicate, we are in full cooperation and we don’t have anything to hide,” Kwon tweeted.

Kwon did not reveal where he was, saying crypto Twitter has “no business knowing my GPS coordinates.” He added they are defending themselves in “multiple jurisdictions” and look forward to “clarifying the truth over the next few months.”

Singapore does not have an extradition treaty with South Korea, but the SPF stated it will assist Korean authorities within the scope of its domestic laws and international obligations and didn’t provide any further details.

In May, the Terra ecosystem Kwon co-founded arguably had the biggest crash in cryptocurrency history after its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD Classic (USTC), originally TerraUSD (UST) [lost its US dollar peg](https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-terra-blockchain-officially-halted-following-luna-price-collapse) to hit a low of $0.006 in June.

Its sister asset, now known as Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) met a similar fate with an all-time low of $0.0000009 in May after hitting its all-time high of over $119 the month prior. The twin collapses caused panic among traders, with selling pressure leading to a [wider collapse in the digital asset market](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-brief-history-of-bitcoin-crashes-and-bear-markets-2009-2022).

While the LUNC community rejoices because of a potential comeback for the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) token, the founder of the Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, is now facing a warrant of arrest from South Korean authorities. 

A court located in Seoul reportedly issued a warrant of arrest for Kwon and five other people who are all currently located in Singapore. According to the prosecutor’s office in South Korea, the Terra founder is facing allegations of violating the country’s capital markets law

In May, what the Terra community first suspected to be a FUD attack became one of the most devastating market crashes in crypto history, triggering the loss of millions of assets from investors of TerraUSD (UST) — now renamed TerraUSD Classic (USTC) — and Terra (LUNA), which is also rebranded to Luna Classic (LUNC). The UST stablecoin started to drift away from its United States dollar peg, dropping to an all-time low of $0.006 in June.

Apart from UST, LUNA, an asset that once reached its peak at $119.18 in April, dropped massively to an all-time low of $0.0000009, causing suicide hotlines to be pinned on the project’s Reddit community.

The Terra crash also affected various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, leading to an 80% and above decline for projects that were associated with the stablecoin.

On Aug. 17, Kwon hired attorneys from a law firm based in South Korea just a few days after saying that the authorities have not yet reached out to him. According to a report, the Terra founder delivered a letter of appointment to the department responsible for investigating the Terra collapse.

The Terra founder also broke his silence on Aug. 16 in an attempt to clear his name from various allegations. However, despite Kwon’s efforts, community members still criticized the Terra CEO, comparing his situation to the creator of Tornado Cash, who was arrested for writing a privacy code.

[Synthetix (SNX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token) $3.05

What Is Synthetix (SNX)?

Website: [synthetix.io](https://synthetix.io/)

Synthetix is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/)) protocol that provides on-chain exposure to a wide variety of crypto and non-crypto assets. The protocol is based on the Ethereum ([ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)) blockchain and offers users access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset.

The platform aims to broaden the cryptocurrency space by introducing non-blockchain assets, providing access to a more robust financial market.

Who Are the Founders of Synthetix?

The network was launched in September 2017 by Kain Warwick under the name Havven (HAV). About a year later the company rebranded to Synthetix.

Kain Warwick is the founder of Synthetix and a non-executive director at the blueshyft retail network. Prior to founding Synthetix, Warwick has worked on several other cryptocurrency projects. He also founded Pouncer, a live auction site exclusive to Australia.

Peter McKean, the project’s CEO, has over two decades of experience in software development. He previously worked as a programmer at ICL Fujitsu.

Jordan Momtazi, the COO of Synthetix, is a business strategist, market analyst and sales leader with several years of experience in blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital payments and e-commerce systems.

Justin J. Moses, the CTO, was the former director of engineering at MongoDB and deputy practice head of engineering at Lab49. He also co-founded Pouncer.

What Makes Synthetix Unique?

Synthetix is a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex)) and a platform for synthetic assets. The protocol is designed in a way that exposes users to the underlying assets via synths, without having to hold the underlying asset.

The platform allows users to autonomously trade and exchange synths. It also has a staking pool where holders can stake their SNX tokens and are rewarded with a share of the transaction fees on the Synthetix Exchange.

The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for [third-party](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-dao) facilitators.

SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract.

Since launch, the protocol has transitioned to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet to help reduce the gas fees on the network and lower oracle latency.

How Many Synthetix (SNX) Coins Are There in Circulation?

The circulating supply of SNX is 236,567,378 coins. At the seed round and token sale stages, Synthetix sold more than 60 million tokens and was able to raise $30 million. Of the total 100,000,000 coins issued during the ICO, 20% was allocated to the team and advisors, 3% to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% to partnership incentives and 12% to the foundation.

Where Can You Buy Synthetix (SNX)?

SNX tokens can be purchased at top exchanges, such as: [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/okex/), [Coinbase Pro](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-pro/), [Uniswap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/uniswap-v2/)

Who Are the Founders of Nexo?

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/) was founded by a team of finance professionals and crypto enthusiasts, who turned to blockchain to create the crypto equivalent to a service well established in traditional finance, but hitherto non-existent in digital finance— borrowing against the value of your assets while retaining ownership. In 2018, the team launched the Nexo platform, offering the world’s first crypto credit lines that allowed digital asset holders to obtain fiat and stablecoin loans against their cryptocurrency, and thus setting the foundations of the crypto lending niche.

The collective behind Nexo has a combined experience of over 30 years in financial services, including non-crypto lending, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and hedge funds, with Co-founder and Managing Partner [Antoni Trenchev](https://twitter.com/antroninexo) additionally contributing with experience in Finance Law and in KYC and AML solutions.

Trenchev, who has acted as the public face of Nexo’s leadership, has a track record in advocating for wider blockchain and crypto adoption, notably serving as member of parliament in Bulgaria’s National Assembly from 2015 to 2017, where he promoted the implementation of blockchain solutions for e-government services, as well as frequently commenting on crypto and digital finance-related current events to mainstream media, including [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-12-11/bitcoin-foundations-are-firm-says-nexo-s-antoni-trenchev-video), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-price-all-time-high-record-b1761235.html), and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/06/25/hard-for-cryptocurrency-doubters-to-continue-their-cause-expert.html).

Nexo currently services over a million users across 200+ jurisdictions, managing over $4 billion in assets. The company currently has 150 employees, with its management based in London.

What Makes Nexo Unique?

According to its [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper), Nexo is the [first-ever](https://nexo.io/assets/downloads/Nexo-Whitepaper.pdf) provider of instant cryptocurrency-backed loans and it intends to solve inefficiencies in the lending market. Its automated lending process uses [smart contracts](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) and an [oracle](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/oracles-in-defi-101-a-deep-dive-by-tellor) on the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) blockchain to manage loans. After a user transfers cryptocurrency to a Nexo-controlled wallet, the oracle establishes the loan and the user is instantly allocated the funds. When the user makes a deposit in order to repay the loan, the oracle returns the cryptocurrency and records the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used to power NEXO and to record user balances.

Nexo is [marketed](https://nexo.io/assets/downloads/Business-Overview.pdf) to individual and institutional investors, cryptocurrency companies, exchanges, miners and others who want [liquidity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity) from their assets. The company makes a profit from the interest accumulated on loans, and it also offers institutional lending and consulting services.

Nexo seeks to build a user base of clients that continue to use the platform and remain invested in NEXO. As such, the company announced a loyalty program that rewards those who keep NEXO in their accounts, giving them preferential interest rates on [loans](https://nexo.io/blog/the-loyalty-program-and-how-it-benefits-you-part-1-better-borrowing) and higher yields on [savings](https://nexo.io/blog/the-loyalty-program-and-how-it-benefits-you-part-2-dynamic-passive-income). Nexo also [distributes](https://medium.com/nexo/nexo-dividends-explained-6636804db3a) 30% of its profits to NEXO token holders in the form of dividends.

How Many Nexo (NEXO) Coins Are There in Circulation?

Nexo has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Of this amount, the circulating supply stands at 560,000,010 according to [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nexo)

While Nexo initially planned to have a public presale and main token sale, it later [canceled](https://medium.com/nexo/update-on-the-nexo-token-sale-995e9c21e22b) its public sales due to an overwhelming amount of interest from investors in its private sale.

In October 2020, the company [announced](https://medium.com/nexo/dispatch-8-nexo-invites-you-to-tokenup-with-nexonomics-bdcb9ef9e38d) that it was launching a ""Nexonomics"" initiative to drive its [tokenomics](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) and increase the value of NEXO. The company subsequently [revealed](https://nexo.io/blog/nexo-launches-12-million-dollar-buyback-program) that it would buy back $12 million worth of NEXO.

Where Can You Buy Nexo (NEXO)?

NEXO can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [UPEX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upex/), [Hoo](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/hoo/) and [Bitrue](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitrue/), among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the South Korean won and the Indian rupee, cryptocurrencies such as [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum) (ETH), and the stablecoin [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) (USDT).

[NEAR Protocol (NEAR)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/near) $4.22

What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

Website: [near.org](https://near.org/)

[NEAR Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/) is a [layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) that was designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and that eliminates some of the limitations that have been bogging competing blockchains, such as low transaction speeds, low throughput and poor interoperability. This provides the ideal environment for [DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps) and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). NEAR also introduces unique solutions to scaling problems and has its own [consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism) called “Doomslug.”

NEAR Protocol is being built by the NEAR Collective, its community that is updating the initial code and releasing updates to the ecosystem. Its declared goal is to build a platform that is “secure enough to manage high value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people.”

[Flux](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/), a protocol that allows developers to create markets based on assets, commodities, real-world events, and Mintbase, an [NFT](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token) minting platform are examples of projects being built on NEAR Protocol.

Who Are the Founders of NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

NEAR Protocol was founded by Erik Trautman, an entrepreneur with experience on Wall Street and founder of Viking Education. His co-founders were Illia Polosukhin, who has more than ten years of industry experience, including three years at Google, and Alexander Skidanov, a computer scientist that worked at Microsoft and went on to join memSQL, where he became the director of engineering. NEAR Protocol has an extensive team of experienced developers that includes several International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) gold medalists and winners. The team claims to have people with experience of building some of the only real-world sharded systems at scale, a solution the protocol is pursuing to improve blockchain scalability.

What Makes NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Unique?

NEAR uses its Nightshade technology to improve transaction throughput massively. Nightshade is a variation of [sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding), in which individual sets of validators process transactions in parallel across multiple sharded chains, improving the overall capacity of the blockchain. In contrast to “regular” sharding, shards in Nightshade produce a fraction of the next block, called “chunks.” In doing so, NEAR Protocol is able to achieve up to 100,000 transactions per second and achieve near-instant transaction finality thanks to a one-second block cadence while simultaneously keeping transaction fees at virtually zero.

NEAR Protocol also improves upon the convoluted onboarding process of other blockchains by having human-readable addresses and building decentralized applications with similar registration flow to what users have already experienced. Moreover, it provides developers with modular components, helping them start projects like token contracts or NFTs more quickly.

Near Protocol Ecosystem Fund

On Oct. 25, 2021, NEAR [announced](https://near.org/blog/near-announces-800-million-in-funding-initiatives-to-support-ecosystem-growth/) a $800 million in ecosystem funding initiatives, following in the footsteps of various [Layer-1s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain) blockchains like [Avalanche](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/), [Fantom](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/) and [Celo](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/). The fund will be used to bankroll initiatives that will focus on accelerating growth in the NEAR protocol ecosystem. The fund includes $350 million in funding from Proximity Labs. Out of the total fund, $250 million will be used to help existing projects scale, and $100 million will be allocated to the Startup Grant Pools, where 20 startups will be given $5M each. NEAR will focus on funding [Decentralized Finance](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) (DeFi) focused teams that are “actively revolutionizing and reimagining the way we interact with money.” NEAR is also actively looking for projects building on [NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-token), [DAOs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) and gaming. On a separate note, NEAR recently raised $150 million in seed investment led by Three Arrows Capital, with additional participation from Mechanism Capital, Dragonfly Capital, a16z, Jump, Alameda, Zee Prime and more. This will be used to accelerate the adoption of [Web3](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/web-3-0) technologies.

[Terra Classic (LUNC)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-classic-wormhole) $0.0002385

What Is Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Website:[ terra.money](https://www.terra.money/)

Terra is a [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) protocol that uses fiat-pegged [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-stablecoin) to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of [Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements.

Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially launched in April 2019. As of September 2021, it [offers](https://medium.com/terra-money/announcing-terrausd-ust-the-interchain-stablecoin-53eab0f8f0ac) stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.

On May 28, 2022, the genesis block of the new chain was launched to conduct future transactions under the name [Terra (LUNA)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna-v2/), and the original Terra Chain was rebranded as Terra Classic. The original native token — LUNA has also been renamed as LUNA Classic (LUNC). Moreover, all network [stablecoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin) (UST, KRT, EUT) have been renamed to Terra Classic stablecoins (USTC, KRTC, EUTC). There will be no Terra stablecoins on the new chain.

There is a theory that the additional term “classic” is a reference to the [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) / [Ethereum Classic](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-classic/) split in 2017. According to CEO, Do Kwon, the collapse of UST in the spring of 2022 is the equivalent moment of the Ethereum’s [DAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao) hack that took place in 2017.

What Is Luna Classic (LUNC)?

Luna Classic (LUNC) is the first native token of Terra blockchain released in August 2018. $LUNC existed before the launch of the new chain — now branded Terra (LUNA) — and works with the original code of the Terra ecosystem.

The main function that the native token performed was to absorb the price deviation of the [algorithmic stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin) — $UST. The price of the UST stablecoin was pegged to the US dollar by minting and burning UST tokens to balance the supply and demand of the coin. In May 2022, UST lost its peg and collapsed. The UST stablecoin algorithm created trillions of LUNA tokens, fell into a hyperinflationary spiral, and reduced the value of the original LUNA token by 99%.

What is the difference between Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Both versions of the token have the right to exist as a result of the implementation of a proposal called Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2. The essence of the plan is to split the current blockchain through [forking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fork-blockchain), which created a new chain in the ecosystem, preserving the previous version.

According to the recovery plan, the existing chain and token have been rebranded as Terra Classic. The new LUNA tokens were [airdropped](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/airdrop) to existing holders of LUNA and UST before the depeg and subsequent crash occurred.

Who Are the Founders of Terra Classic?

Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two [conceived](https://medium.com/kucoinexchange/kucoin-ama-series-terra-luna-full-transcript-a3019e664195) of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra.

Prior to developing Terra, Shin [co-founded](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201112/the-returnees.html) and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later [co-founded](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/03/133_162546.html) Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies.

Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.

What Makes Terra Classic Unique?

Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.

Terra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/terra-partners-with-mobile-payment-app-chai-29c593f0a364) a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.

In addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company [announced](https://medium.com/terra-money/state-of-the-terra-alliance-d7f3ff8f6411) that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.

Terra Classic's Role for UST

The LUNA token and [UST](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/) are mutually dependent, as the success of the [Terra ecosystem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-terra-a-guide-to-terra-s-ecosystem) is a function of the adoption of UST as a [stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/stablecoin). LUNA backs UST and is burned when demand for UST rises. Following upgrades like [Columbus-5](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/columbus-5-is-almost-here-what-does-that-mean-for-terra-and-its-users-flipside-crypto), the supply of LUNA could become highly deflationary in the long run.

On the flip side, the value of LUNA can also decrease if UST is perceived as unstable. UST briefly lost its peg following the Wormhole hack, leading to a temporary price crash for LUNA.

In May 2022, a series of liquidations and bank runs from investors pulling their funds out saw UST Classic depeg to as low as $0.044. LUNA Classic crashed over 99% from over $80. UST Classic never recovered its peg.

How Many Terra Classic (LUNC) Coins Are There in Circulation?

As of August 2022, the total supply of Terra Classic (LUNC) is 6.9T, and there are 6.5T LUNC in circulation.

Where Can You Buy Terra Classic (LUNC)?

Most crypto exchanges supported Terra Luna in the past, and they continue to do so now with Terra Classic (LUNC). Luna Classic is currently available on major platforms, including [Binance](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/), [KuCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kucoin/), [FTX](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/ftx/), [Kraken](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/kraken/), [Huobi Global](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/huobi-global/), [PancakeSwap (V2)](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/), [MEXC](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/pancakeswap-v2/) and [Gate.io](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-io/).

Network and token freeze after Acala exploit raises questions,expay24,wou53m,2022-08-15 04:24:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/wou53m/network_and_token_freeze_after_acala_exploit/,Expay-24,,"The Acala Network’s aUSD [stablecoin](https://cointelegraph.com/altcoins-for-beginners/stablecoins-101-what-are-crypto-stablecoins-and-how-do-they-work) depegged by over 99% over the weekend and forced the Acala team to pause a hacker’s wallet, raising concerns about its claim of being decentralized.

On Sunday, a hacker took [advantage](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1558785360670298112) of a bug on the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool which resulted in 1.2 billion aUSD being [minted](https://acala.subscan.io/account/26JmEcghNmggvT46sojckg34Py9zFRKkCcFy3gr49hrFgT2k?tab=transfer) without collateral. This event crashed the United States dollar-pegged stablecoin to a cent, and in response, the Acala team froze the erroneously minted tokens by placing the network in maintenance mode.

The move also halted other features such as swaps, xcm (cross-chain communications on Polkadot), and the oracle pallet price feeds until “further notice.”

While the move to put the network in maintenance mode and freeze funds in the hacker’s wallet may have been meant to protect users and the network from any further harm, proponents of decentralization have cried foul.

Acala is a cross-chain [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/defi-a-comprehensive-guide-to-decentralized-finance) hub that issues the aUSD stablecoin based on the Polkadot blockchain. aUSD is a crypto-backed stablecoin which Acala claims is censorship-resistant. iBTC is a form of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), which can be used in DeFi protocols.

Community members have noted the irony of Acala’s claims about aUSD’s censorship resistance since the protocol froze funds so swiftly. Twitter user Gr33nHatt3R.dot [pointed out](https://twitter.com/Gr33nHatt3R) on Aug. 14 that [decisions](https://twitter.com/Gr33nHatt3R/status/1558748825279422466) “would have to go to governance to be ‘decentralized’ finance:”

“If Acala centrally controls that decision is this really DeFi?”

A member of the project’s Discord channel usafmike [proposed](https://discord.com/channels/709208197549785148/933859814856093716/1008393500452200640) rolling back the chain to reverse the token mints altogether but was [challenged](https://discord.com/channels/709208197549785148/933859814856093716/1008400850433081404) by skylordafk.dot, another member who said such an action would “set a harmful precedent.”

As of the time of writing, the network was still in maintenance mode to block all token transfers, but the team confirmed that the bug had been fixed. The wallets that received erroneously minted aUSD have been identified, and 99% of them were still on Acala which leaves the possibility that they may be retrieved by the community if it votes to do so.

# Australian central bank governor favors private sector crypto technology

Australian central bank Governor Phillip Lowe said that a private solution “is going to be better” for cryptocurrency as long as risks are mitigated through regulation.

Lowe commented at a recent G20 finance meeting in Indonesia. Reuters reported on July 17 that officials from other countries discussed the impact of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) on global financial systems.

Recent risks associated with stablecoins can largely be chalked up to depegging events. In May, the Terra USD stablecoin UST, which has since changed to Terra Classic USD (USTC), lost its peg and drove down the value of the entire Terra Classic ecosystem. It caused a multi-billion dollar cascade effect leading to Tether (USDT) and the DEI stablecoin briefly depegging.

Lowe suggested that strong regulations or even state backing could help mitigate the risks to the public. cointelegraph. com

# Bitcoin hodling activity resembles previous market bottoms: Glassnode

The majority of Bitcoin has been “hodled” for at least three months in behavior bearing a striking resemblance to previous Bitcoin market bottoms, says blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.

In a July 16 tweet, Glassnode noted that more than 80% of the total U.S. dollar (USD)-denominated wealth invested in Bitcoin has not been touched for at least three months.

Bitcoin’s price is $21,013 at the time of writing, down almost 70% from its all-time high of $69,044 in November 2021. The current price puts around 45% of Bitcoin holders with an on-paper loss, according to crypto intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.

According to the Glassnode chart, other times that saw similar levels of Bitcoin hodling were during the end of the bear markets of 2012, 2015, and 2018.

Last week, Coinbase's head of institutional research, David Duong, wrote in a July 12 report titled “The Elusive Bottom” that on-chain data suggests that recent BTC selling has been carried out “almost exclusively” by short-term speculators. Long-term BTC holders “have not been selling into the market weakness,” he added. cointelegraph. com

# $248M stablecoins flow out of Coinbase as community refutes exchange liquidity issues

 Rumors surfaced Friday night that Coinbase could face liquidity issues following leaked emails stating that it would suspend its affiliate program. Business Insider reported that they received emails stating;

“This has not been an easy decision, nor was it made lightly, but, due to crypto market conditions and the outlook for the remainder of 2022, Coinbase is unable to continue supporting incentivized traffic to its platform.”

Some took to Twitter to claim the decision was indicative of liquidity problems for the top US exchange. Kurt Wuckert Jr of CoinGeek tweeted that the suspension of the affiliate program, in combination with other decisions made by Coinbase over the past several weeks, signifies a “liquidity crisis” is looming.

On July 15, around 50% of stablecoins on Coinbase Pro left the exchange, according to on-chain data from CryptoQuant; the total value came to approximately $248 million. The percentage stablecoin outflow was significantly higher on Coinbase than on other exchanges such as Binance. Only around 1% of stablecoin reserves left Binance over the same period, but the tokens had a similar value at just under $300 million. cryptoslate. com

# Ethereum’s centralized dApps may overshadow the decentralization of proof-of-stake

A lively debate on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vziazb/more_than_50_of_ethereum_is_hosted_on_amazons_aws/) Friday resurfaced the discussion of whether the computing infrastructure built on top of Ethereum is too centralized. According to [on-chain data](https://ethernodes.org/networkType/Hosting), approximately 32% of all Ethereum nodes operate on Amazon AWS servers. However, Amazon claims the number to be closer to 25%.

Since 2020 little has changed regarding the improvement of node decentralization within Ethereum. However, Pomp’s tweet is not entirely accurate. 

**Centralization of Ethereum**

The below image shows the percentage of hosted Ethereum nodes running on AWS. At first glance, this looks highly concerning as it goes against the decentralization narrative in Ethereum.

Yet, the chart ignores nodes running on private machines instead of cloud-hosted servers. Hosting service providers facilitate around 67% of all nodes, and 29% are located in residential settings. cryptoslate. com

# MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor says Ethereum is a security

In an interview with Altcoin Daily, MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor said Ethereum (ETH) is security.

According to Saylor, the fact that Ethereum was first issued via an initial coin offering proves it is not a commodity.

“There’s a management team. There was a pre-mine. There’s a hard fork. There are continual hard forks.”

He also talked about Ethereum’s difficulty bomb and how it keeps getting postponed every six months, which serves to prove the asset is a security.

If the Ethereum difficulty bomb went off, it would disincentivize miners and mark the network’s full transition into a proof of stake network.

## Michael Saylor classifies most crypto assets as securities

In Saylor’s opinion, a cryptocurrency can only be a commodity if there is no issuer and no one is making any decisions on the network.

Saylor said,

“If you look at most of these cryptos, where they have hard fork after hard fork after hard fork, the problem with a hard fork is changing the protocol means that some development team is making a decision, and if you can change the protocol in a material way, you can change the monetary protocol. A hard fork can change the issuance pattern, or it can change the value of something. So that makes an investment contract under securities law.” cryptoslate.com

# First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Dips Below $21K; Why the Current Bear Market Differs 

Bitcoin's four-day winning streak snapped on Sunday with the largest cryptocurrency tumbling below $21,000.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $20,800, down more than a percentage point over the past 24 hours, although still higher than it stood before starting its mini-rally on Wednesday. Market observers see the crypto continuing to trade in the $18,000 to $22,000 range that it has maintained for a month, at least until investors have a clearer sign whether central banks can lick inflation without casting the global economy into recession.

""While Bitcoin saw positive momentum this week, it remains range-bound when you take a broader view, and is still struggling to cross the $22,000 resistance,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk."
Terra Luna and UST,u_CoinHarbour,vv1dhc,2022-07-09 09:09:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CoinHarbour/comments/vv1dhc/terra_luna_and_ust/,CoinHarbour,,"Recently we have had several requests to trade various Terra Luna and UST digital assets on CoinHarbour.

This was referred to internal CoinHarbour Compliance and Risk Committee, and a decision was made that these crypto represented too great a risk to our customers. CoinHarbour will not list or operate a market for Terra Luna and UST digital assets in the near future. This includes related coins, such as ""Terra 2.0"". 

All digital assets include some financial risk for customers, however, we feel the risk for Terra Luna is far too great.

Terra is a blockchain protocol and payment platform used for algorithmic stablecoins. The project was created in 2018 by Terraform Labs, a startup co-founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin. It is most known for its Terra stablecoin and the associated Luna reserve asset cryptocurrency. In May 2022, the Terra blockchain was temporarily halted after the collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and Luna, in an event that wiped out almost $45 billion in market capitalisation within a week

Beginning on 9 May 2022, the tokens made headlines after UST began to break its peg to the US dollar. Over the next week, the price of UST plunged to 10 cents, while Luna fell to ""virtually zero"", down from an all-time high of $119.51. Before the crash, Luna was one of the top ten largest cryptocurrencies on the market. The collapse wiped out almost $45 billion of market capitalisation over the course of a week.

On 13 May, Terraform Labs temporarily halted the Terra blockchain in response to the falling prices of UST and Luna. Despite the company's attempts to stabilise UST and Luna via its bitcoin and other cryptocurrency reserves from the Luna Foundation Guard, the 1:1 peg of UST to USD did not materialise. As of 16 May 2022, blockchain analysts claim that the usage of the bitcoin reserves of LFG still remains largely uncertain.

Likely causes of the collapse included mass withdrawals from the Anchor Protocol days before the collapse, investor concerns about cryptocurrencies more generally, and a drop in the price of bitcoin. During the collapse, holders converted Terra into Luna via the mint-and-burn system, which caused the price of Luna to collapse due to its increased supply. This in turn destabilised the balancing mechanism between the currencies.

On 25 May, a proposal was approved to reissue a new Luna cryptocurrency and to decouple from and abandon the devalued UST stablecoin. The original blockchain is now called Terra Classic, and the original Luna token is called Luna Classic. The new Luna coin is called ""Terra 2.0"" by investors, and has lost valuation in the opening days of being listed on exchanges."

# 🗽 The Investing Series - Part 3 of 11 🗽

Unless you have been living under a small boulder, and/or unless you are still stuck in the past as it relates to processing that all of us were indeed locked inside the confines of our homes for over a year straight due to the first Pandemic of the technological era, we are now facing [near-U.S.record setting inflation](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/).  We don't need to ask why or how this happened.  Our global leaders and policymakers failed to understand freshman-level fundamentals regarding economics.  Yet, some would go as far as to say it was intentional.  We can look into this.

But why do any of us have to fall victim to inflation?  What is it?  Why do we care?  How do we beat it?  How do we come out on top of inflation - by using our raw understanding of it - from an investing standpoint?  Let's introduce inflationary and deflationary temporal (time function) arbitrage:

&#x200B;

Let's begin by analyzing some historical examples of inflation:

&#x200B;

# Historical Examples of Hyperinflation

&#x200B;

# The French Revolution - 1789-1799

&#x200B;

[The French Revolution included one of many early examples of Hyperinflation](https://preview.redd.it/s39p34n36n991.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a315f511d4e1b2f7ef6b8e58758df552b56801)

In 1789 the French found themselves in a desperate situation. Tax revenue fell far short of expenses, and the government survived only by advances from the Bank of Discount, a bank that largely *loaned funds to the government*. The bank 'ran out of funds', yet they still *needed resources* to complete the Revolution. They met the crises with two measures: 1. confiscate assets like church land, and 2. create an “extraordinary treasury” charged with raising 400 million 'Livres' (the currency at the time of the Kingdom of France since the year 781) by selling 'Assignats' (certificates of indebtedness at 5 percent interest). The government announced intent to sell the land (collateral essentially) for Assignats.

It was unclear which land would be sold to creditors. In 1790 they converted the Assignats into *bank notes* while adding an extra 800 million Livres to the issue. The current decree, however, specified that Assignats in total were not to exceed 1,200 million Livres. The new Assignats reaped no interest and could be acquired by anyone.  The first issue was available only to creditors of the government.  Instead of just *liquidating the national debt*, the government issued Assignats *to spend and accrue continual deficits.*

&#x200B;

[Since the experience of the French Revolution, hyperinflation has been associated with revolutionary change.  It played a role in the rise of Hitler to power in Germany, the Communist Revolution in China, and the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The American Revolution also had a hyperinflationary episode.](https://preview.redd.it/esyi2wz66n991.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd863a2d1d9337374eb9ea70ecb52e7dfd719cd5)

By 1792, prices of normal goods in France rose 50 percent while wages lagged far behind.  By 1793, a mob *stormed stores in Paris and in February* a scarcity of soap sparked *further riots*. Mobs also obstructed *grain shipments*.  In 1794 the government implemented a *system of price controls* known as the Law of the Maximum.  People who refused to accept Assignats in payment could be fined 3,000 Livres and imprisoned for six months.  Speculation in Assignats could bring six years’ imprisonment, and forestalling (hoarding from circulation) was *punishable by death*.  Nevertheless, farmers and manufactures hoarded goods, and the specter of famine rose up for the spring.  In 1794 the government abandoned the price controls, prices skyrocketed, and Assignats *dropped to less than 3 percent of their face value.*

By 1795, the nominal value of each successive issue was reduced according to a scale of proportions.Peasants stopped bringing produce to the market to avoid accepting Assignats.  Speculation became rampant; inflation ruined creditors and savers alike.  *As prices outpaced wages and workers suffered*, ***speculative profits created a new class of ostentatious rich who stood in stark contrast to the destitution of the lower classes***.  Inflation peaked; each day seeing prices rise hourly, and each night paper money came off the press for issuance the following day.  *Paper money issues doubled in four months*, for a total of 39 billion Livres in Assignats.

In 1796 Assignats were discontinued.  The public had lost faith in paper money, however, the government decided to return to the 'Specie' currency.  *Inflation continued to ravage the economy* until the advent of Napoleon in 1799.  His wars brought in more than they cost and his government improved the efficiency of taxation, ending the government’s need to promiscuously print fiat currency.

&#x200B;

[\\""Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction. And does it in a manner which no one man in a million is able to diagnose.\\"" \(Keynes, 1920\)](https://preview.redd.it/ji1gtok46n991.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6db93c94856360f07c8f9b7a8b6c445e866000de)

&#x200B;

# Hungary, 1930-1946

&#x200B;

In the wake of the World War I, the Hungarian 'pengo' *currency was created* to stabilize the country’s economy and *correct the country’s inflation*.

The Great Depression impacted Hungary's agriculture.  Mounting debt forced the central bank to devalue (AKA *print more of*) the currency to cover costs by loosening monetary policy.

By the onset of World War II, Hungary was already weak economically, and the central bank was almost under full control of the government; *printing money based on the government’s budgetary needs without any sort of financial restraint.*

&#x200B;

[Man Sweeping Worthless Pengo Currency off the Street](https://preview.redd.it/vh3mi9p65n991.jpg?width=440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33e2e682a7ea7f187e6daf66cb5fd27ce1a38d2a)

Eventually, the inflationary environment became so dire that the pengo began disappearing from circulation, beginning with the silver pengos and even bronze and nickel pengos, as the component metals became far more valuable than the coins themselves. \[*This we saw recently in Copper markets*\].

As war subsided, the government did take full control of currency production without real collateral.Then, the occupying Soviet army simultaneously began issuing its own military currency.  This further reduced demand for the pengo.

The pengo began to hyperinflate, rendering itself near value-less in an acute timeframe.  Despite many mass-scale measures to stabilize it, the only remedy was to *give up* *and introduce a new currency in 1946*, called the 'Forint', with its direct conversion into gold and thus into global currencies. The Forint is still in circulation today.  386 of them equates to one U.S. Dollar.

&#x200B;

# Modern Example of Hyperinflation

# LUNA Cryptocurrency (by Terra Labs)

&#x200B;

Three Arrows Capital is now in bankruptcy.  Little does the world know that this was partly caused by hyperinflation of a cryptocurrency known as LUNA only two months ago.  Albeit, in this case, the hyperinflation occurred very quickly with the aid of their *price controls* algorithm.

The UST (Terra USD cryptocurrency) was minted and utilized as a 'stablecoin.'  This stablecoin was 'backed' by underlying LUNA cryptocurrency, which was also minted (or printed) by Terra Labs.  The algorithm was designed to print new LUNA to offset any 'depegging' of the UST cryptocurrency to its dollar equivalent.  So, any time the UST fell in price, LUNA coins were minted.

&#x200B;

[LUNA became worthless overnight due to acute algorithmic hyperinflation. The code proved inherently unstable in trying to print LUNA to offset a UST stablecoin 'depeg'](https://preview.redd.it/1t6xopvkfn991.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a883ea76d0f0f827387cf4ada2423d85e841c23)

As investors realized that the peg was failing, they rapidly lost trust in LUNA.  This led to both a UST selloff and a LUNA selloff, which then furthered the decline in the value of the peg of UST to the dollar.  This, then, accelerated the algorithmic minting of LUNA.  At the end of just one day, in May 2022, about 6.5 Trillion LUNA was printed overnight, becoming near-worthless.

One week later, the Terra Labs team renamed LUNA to 'Terra Classic,' and minted a new cryptocurrency that trades under the symbol LUNA, and is called LUNA 2.0.  Upon issue, the value of LUNA 2.0 itself then plummeted 91.5%.

So, how do we protect, or shield ourselves, from such inflationary devaluing of our transactable currencies?  Before we talk about Arbitrage based on Time, and how to exploit this phenomenon, we need to understand Time Value of Money and Inflation, and how they are different.

&#x200B;

# Differences between Time Value of Money and Inflation - A common misconception by erroneous 'fusion of knowledge'

&#x200B;

There is a commonly used phrase called Time Value of Money (TVM).  In general, and not even including inflationary effects of money, money today is more valuable than the same amount of money tomorrow.

&#x200B;

[Time Value of Money as a standalone - ignoring inflation](https://preview.redd.it/6djj2c7whn991.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=f35735c838c40ab6bf46dd7a3634a5dd267a8818)

&#x200B;

We can calculate this difference in value using Future and Present value equations:

&#x200B;

>**Future Value = Present Value \* \[ 1 + (i / n) \] \^ (n \* t)**

&#x200B;

Where FV = Future value of money, PV = Present value of money, i = interest rate, n = number of compounding periods per year, and t = number of years.

For instance, if the present value (PV) of an investment is $10 million, and the amount is invested at a rate of return of 10% for one year, the future value (FV) is equal to:

&#x200B;

>**Future Value = $10 million \* \[1 + (10% / 1\] \^ (1 \* 1) = $11 million**

&#x200B;

You'll also see the phrase Net Present Value.  This takes a future value, discounts it, and applies that \[lower number\] to today.

**However, inflation Accelerates the Demise of Future Value.**  As you can see, inflation is not a variable in the equation.  Instead, the 'i' for interest assumes that we are investing that money at interest compounded annually.  If we assume an inflation rate of 8.6%, then we have to factor that in by subtracting it from 'i' in the above equation.  Essentially, and as we can see, you would need to be making 8.6% on your investment today just to break even on your dollars, due to inflation.  Since 8.6% is very hard for even hedge funds to achieve, you can start to envision the emergency that the country and the world is currently in.

Analyzing the dollar, every future dollar should technically be written as less today, because of the fact that we weren't able to capitalize on that capital today, we weren't able to generate compound interest on it, as well as the fact that the money supply will be diluted a few percent by that point (inflation rate, which is a byproduct of a government printing and/or digitally-creating new money).

&#x200B;

[The U.S. Dollar itself has significantly declined in purchasing power over time](https://preview.redd.it/acwnzk04gn991.jpg?width=1601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515b849f77067687b9086a49cf315c530a8e6c4f)

&#x200B;

An example of this: Let's say I enter into a contract deal today that states that I would get paid back for a debt of $100 in the year 3000.  As we know, because inflation will be happening every year since then \[based on new money being created annually\] I can expect $100 by 3000 to be close to worthless in that future.  So, we would need to find what buying power $100 has today, and then compare that buying power with the equivalent buying power would be like in the year 3000. If dollars are still a thing by then, then we would have to compound $100 for inflation for 978 years in a row.  If we assume 3% inflation annually, then we would need to be paid about $532 Trillion in the year 3000.  That's the value of what $100 today would equate to in the year 3000.

Further, dollars might not even be a thing by the year 3000. So one would probably want to account for risk of the today's currency no longer having value in the future. Things change, and if they don't, then what you have today will be diluted by the time the future comes.  Perhaps the world at that time will be run entirely by blockchain, or a completely new type of currency.

The impact that inflation has on a currency is that it decreases the value of each unit of a currency over time beyond the reduction in the future value just due to Time Value of Money. Time Value of Money is a concept that describes how the money available to you today is worth more than the same amount of money at a future date, based on your ability to control the compounding of the money, as well as the prospect of future-uncertainty always looming.

&#x200B;

# 🕚 Inflationary and Deflationary Temporal Arbitrage 🕚

# Inflationary Temporal Arbitrage

**Arbitrage:** Arbitrage means capitalizing on a price difference of the same product in two or more markets.  For example, if you can buy a material at a price of $1800 in market A, but market B has the material going for $1900, then one would be incentivized to use their capital to buy the material in market A and then sell it immediately in market B.

**Time:** However, Arbitrage rarely includes the concept of 'time' - the known dimension that we as organisms process our conscious reality based on our perception and relativity.  If you knew that a currency was being actively devalued, what would you do?  Yes.  We steer away from ownership of that currency and try to hold everything else that has raw intrinsic value, *with intent to sell the same product on a different market (in this case, the different market is the same market albeit in the future*).  Examples of things to own in this case are commodities (gold, oil), land, buildings, houses, and raw materials.  Also, collectible assets and tangibles like art have stood the test of time against inflation.  If you can say to yourself, can this be diluted?  and if the answer is no, then it is a good thing to own during hyperinflation.  If we intend to sell the product later after inflation runs its course, then the same intrinsic-value asset will sell for higher values at later dates.

**Loans and Mortgages:** The key here is to recognize when this type of inflationary scenario could occur, and then seek to borrow money immediately.  Apply for any loan basically.  This is simple to do.  When we take a loan *prior to* a high inflationary environment, then the amount borrowed (i.e. the number itself on paper) cannot inflate.  We are fixing the amount to be paid back.  Let's say we take a 30 year mortgage loan on a $100,000 property, obtained in 2015 for example at 3% interest.  If the total amount to be paid back is $190,000 (principal plus interest over the life of the loan), then by 2045 it would still be $190,000 owed.  It doesn't change.  Yet, if inflation happened to average 7% over that period, then *the equivalent value of the home by 2045 would be* $761,225.50.  By selling the home at that point, and assuming the bank allowed us to simply generate interest without paying off any principal at all, then *we would not only own the asset for free at the end of the term, but we would receive $571,225.50 in free extra cash at the time of sale due to inflationary temporal arbitrage.*

&#x200B;

[As we can see, prime brokers and hedge funds are utilizing the Federal Reserve's Overnight Reverse Repo Program for this very reason - to capture a low rate payback in order to benefit from inflationary temporal arbitrage in ways that retail investors cannot.  This, like we saw with The French Revolution and Hungary, could be the tell-tale sign of runaway hyperinflation prior to the issuance of a new currency.  This could therefore be why Project Hamilton is nearly completed- a research project funded by the Fed to MIT to produce the Central Bank Digital Currency and now in collaboration with the Banks of England and Canada](https://preview.redd.it/etdzgw2jun991.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ad102656ca7fae5d9d75b77c65f6210511f14e)

**Participation in the Underlying Inflationary Currency or Asset**: Another answer to the problem with inflation and hyperinflation, has to do with economic participation.  If you remember from the above example in the French Revolution, the newly developing government strictly precluded the hoarding (also known today as holding or hodling) of commodities.  The government was demanding participation in their newly minted currency which was actively hyperinflating.  Those who did not participate in the currency were in violation of the law, and even sentenced to death.  But if that restriction doesn't currently exist, then nonparticipation in that hyperinflationary fiat currency is a good thing for your portfolio.  Try to steer clear of what is inflating.

# Deflationary Temporal Arbitrage

&#x200B;

[As you can see, the words deflation, economic downturn, decline, and depression are how to undo hyperinflation...](https://preview.redd.it/08rb2nyptn991.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=777cb8ef1407461d81934a8629833271b6bb918f)

So, in this case, we would do the opposite as noted above.  Sell assets, and proceed to active market participation in the currency that is deflating.  Examples of this are Terra Classic cryptocurrency (LUNC, or also known as the original luna), which has been modified with an algorithmic deflationary aspect to reduce the oversupply over time.  Deflation can occur with stocks as well, such as when companies undergo stock splits (see Tesla as a past example and GameStop as an upcoming example).  With a deflationary asset, you want to participate in, and hoard, the asset (or currency) that is deflating.  Other examples are periods of negative value for dollar inflation, where the government reduces the supply of money.  This is rare, as the target inflation rate is 2% for the Fed, which is a positive value.

# TLDR

We showed how important high inflation is from a historical sense, with the French Revolution's (1789-1799) newly minted 'Assignats' currency, and Hungary's (1930-1046) 'Pengo'.  In both cases, after they were diluted into worthlessness, new currencies were implemented in local society.  This poses the question, and perhaps a reason to analyze cryptocurrencies today.  This could be why the Government is focused on stablecoin regulation and upcoming issuance of a Central Bank Digital Currency during a period of near-runaway inflation.  Further, we discussed Time Value of Money, and how money today, regardless of inflation, is more valuable than money tomorrow.  We calculated present and future values.  With inflation, money 'tomorrow' has even lesser value.  We then discussed how to capitalize on ***Inflationary Temporal Arbitrage*** by using tangible assets and/or capturing principal on paper using loans.  We showed how the Federal Reserve Banks' clientele are capitalizing on this technique at now historic, mind-woppling, $2.3 Trillion magnitudes.  We then discussed how participation, explicitly a lack thereof in the underlying inflating currency, is another way to overcome a high inflationary environment."

**What is USTC?**

Rebranded from TerraUSD (UST), TerraClassicUSD (USTC) is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin on the Terra Classic blockchain. After the depeg of USTC in May 2022, the Terra community decided to create a new blockchain without the algorithmic stablecoins called Terra 2.0. The original blockchain is renamed as Terra Classic.

LUNA2 Recovers 70% In Nine Days From Historic Lows,czcalls,vmk43g,2022-06-28 06:35:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/czcalls/comments/vmk43g/luna2_recovers_70_in_nine_days_from_historic_lows/,montorul,,"https://bit.ly/3A5SXOQ

The company behind TerraUSD and Luna, which sparked a crypto market collapse last month, launched a new coin. However, it is now developing actively. For example, nine days after falling to an all-time low of $1.62, the price of Terra’s freshly minted new token (LUNA2) increased significantly.

Regarding recovery from the previous low, LUNA2’s pricing on June 27 reached $2.77, or a 70% increase. Nevertheless, the token is trading almost 77% below its May 30 historical high of $12.24.

According to CoinMarketCap, LUNA2 is currently trading at $2.36 and has a gain of 8% in the last 24 hours. 

After the market fall, many people have been selling their cryptocurrencies. This has made the market more illiquid, even though the prices have started to rebound.

However, the market has started to re-established itself since the recovery started moving during the past week. As a result, the liquidations have begun to level down, and the price of Terra has increased dramatically.

 LUNA2 Has A High Degree Of Risk? During the last week of May, the new Terra network became live and began trading on exchanges such as Bybit, Kucoin, Huobi, and Binance.

 LUNA is currently trading at $2.23 on the hourly chart | Source: LUNA/USD chart from Tradingview.com By adding the newly launched token of the collapsed Terra network, cryptocurrency trading platforms first express their support for its rebirth.

Notably, the price has changed significantly on various exchanges, primarily related to the trading volume. For example, the cost of LUNA2 jumped to $12.24 when it began trading on all major exchanges but ultimately lost all of its gains due to a sharp reversal.

 Similar to LUNA2, Terra UST, and Terra Classic Hikes TerraUSD has recorded a more than 400 % spike over the last seven days despite the heightened volatility associated with Terra’s recently issued coin LUNA 2.0. According to CoinMarketCap, it is trading for an average price of about $0.02014. The 24-hour trading volume for UST is at $83 million.

Similarly, The prices of Terra Classic (LUNC/OLD LUNA) have also increased significantly over the past 24 hours. As a result, the market value of Terra Classic has climbed by $208 million. As per CoinMarketCap, data show the token was trading at $0.00008521 at the time of writing.

On the other hand, Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraforms Labs is currently the subject of a hacktivist organization after dealing with several accusations made by Terra insider FatMan.

Top Decentralized Stablecoin Alternatives to USTC (Formerly UST),czcalls,vip5q3,2022-06-23 01:15:55,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/czcalls/comments/vip5q3/top_decentralized_stablecoin_alternatives_to_ustc/,montorul,,"https://ifttt.com/images/no\_image\_card.png

The recent cataclysmic crash of the Terra Classic (LUNC; formerly LUNA) left several people bankrupt. South Korean officials reported 8 confirmed suicides due to this blow.

Stablecoins emerged as a way for cryptocurrency investors to park their funds to escape from volatility. USTC (formerly UST) was among the largest stablecoins by market cap and the single largest stablecoin on the Cosmos blockchain.

This is not the first time an algorithmic stablecoin fell below the point of recovery. So much so that the head of the IMF even suggested that stablecoins that are not backed by physical assets are similar to pyramid schemes.

However, a crash as biblical as that of UST was a first for a stablecoin. While history seemed to have indicated this to be an obvious outcome, the utility of UST and the communities around LUNC-UST indicated otherwise.

 The Death Spiral – Here’s What Went Wrong Stablecoins are digital assets whose value is pegged to a fiat currency or other asset. USTC is one such stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar by not backed by it.

LUNC maintained USTC’s price algorithmically, using a mint and burn mechanism. When USTC’s demand-to-supply ratio was high, more LUNC was burnt. Contrariwise, more LUNC was minted when USTC’s supply-to-demand ratio was high. This created an arbitrage opportunity for traders which helped maintain USTC’s price at approximately $1.

However, when the selling pressure became too high for the algorithm to keep up, LUNC began to hyperinflate. It thus sent the entire ecosystem into a death spiral, eventually leading to a point of no recovery. Today, USTC costs less than $0.01 while LUNC is over 99% down from its all-time high.

 Decentralized Alternatives – The Way Forward The failure of algorithmic stablecoins doesn’t mean the end of all possibilities. Instead, they provide us with crucial lessons. One of them is avoiding centralization at all costs. So, here’s a list of non-algorithmic, decentralized stablecoins for you to consider while entering the world of crypto.

 1. USDr USDr is a collateralized, fiat-backed stable token receipt by METL, a first decentralized crypto on-ramp solution native to the Avalanche blockchain.

Since METL’s USDr stable token receipt is collateralized with a 1:1 ratio using USD, it will not be affected by unexpected selling pressures like in the case of LUNC and other algorithmic stablecoins.

The USDr token’s issuance mechanism is designed to have users be the actual issuers of the token, so that they interact with the DeFI ecosystem. This allowed METL to bypass any MTL (Money Transmitter Licensing) requirements and receive exemptions in all the states in the US except NY.

METL does not host any wallets and therefore does not take user’s funds on their balance sheet, which again protects them from a bank run. METL is currently building an SDK to let any developer build a FIAT gateway using METL microservices and plug/play it into any DeFI platform that wants native gateway.  METL holds a 20 year patent for this technology issued by the USPTO office.

 2. DAI DAI, a decentralized stablecoin, is a product of MakerDAO, an Ethereum-based peer-to-peer organization facilitating collateralized loans.

Unlike USDC and USDT, DAI is an over-collateralized, crypto-backed stablecoin. This means that the collateral backing this stablecoin is other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, its “over collateralized” nature implies that the value of the collateral backing DAI is greater than DAI’s value. For instance, $1.5 worth of ETH-based (ERC-20) tokens back $1 worth of DAI.

Instead of any centralized, corruptible entity, immutable and tamper-proof smart contracts maintain DAI’s peg to $1 by increasing or decreasing the amount of collateral based on market dynamics.

 3. EOSDT EOSDT is an over-collateralized, decentralized crypto-backed stablecoin by Equilibrium, a cross-chain money market project in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Users can borrow EOSDT by collateralizing their digital assets in a smart contract with a small interest rate of 1% APR.

The stablecoin also has an insurance mechanism called the “Stability Fund” to shield EOSDT and its holders from extreme market volatility.

Further, the price of EOSDT is maintained at $1 by incentivizing arbitrators. This is similar to USTC’s mechanism. However, unlike USTC, EOSDT is not algorithmic and currently has a collateralization ratio of 281%.

 4. sUSD sUSD is a crypto-backed, overcollateralized stablecoin by Synthetix, an ETH-based protocol that facilitates DeFi derivatives trading. sUSD acts as the bridge to trade these on-chain synthetic assets on the Ethereum network.

All synthetic assets on Synthetix are referred to as “Synths” and are denoted by an “s” at the prefix. sBTC, sETH, and sSOL are some examples. Similarly, sUSD is a synthetic stablecoin asset.

 5. RSV RSV is a collateralized stablecoin. However, unlike other tokens mentioned here, RSV employs a hybrid collateralization method. Thus, a combination of fiat and cryptocurrencies back this stablecoin.

RSV is a product of Reserve, a protocol working to offer citizens of countries with high inflation rates a robust inflationary hedge. The Reserve Dollar (RSV) is the stablecoin that facilitates this.

 Caution is Wisdom It’s abundantly clear that you have several alternatives to stablecoins like UST. They are more robust, more reliable, and above all, more decentralized. But despite everything, one can’t stress the importance of due diligence enough in these matters.

You must do your research, thoroughly, before investing in any stablecoin whatsoever. Look closely at the project’s team, their track record, and most importantly, the protocol’s architecture. It’s difficult at times but utterly necessary. Particularly because the crypto domain is still nascent, with much volatility and uncertainty.

New changes are happening every day and you must always be cautious about negative consequences. The storm will, however, be over soon, when the future of finance will shine bright. Stablecoins will define this future, and so can you.

Do Kwon, the CEO and co-founder of the infamous Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) ecosystems, refuted the claims of cashing out $80 million every month for nearly three years. 

Numerous unconfirmed reports surfaced on Saturday, claiming Kwon’s participation in draining liquidity out of Luna Classic (LUNC) and TerraUSD Classic (USTC), before the crash to purchase United States dollar-pegged stablecoin such as Tether (USDT).

Rumors about Kwon cashing out LUNA and UST reserves surfaced after a Twitter thread by FatManTerra shared the alleged details on how Kwon, along with Terra influencers, managed to drain funds while artificially maintaining the liquidity.

However, the entrepreneur advised the crypto community to steer away from fueling the rumor until it was proven true:

“This should be obvious, but the claim that I cashed out $2.7B from anything is categorically false.”
Sharing his side of the story, Kwon stated that the recent rumor of cashing out $80 million per month contradicts the claims that he still holds most of his LUNA holdings, procured during the airdrop. Moreover, Kwon further reiterated that his income over the past two years has only been a cash salary from TerraForm Labs (TFL).

Kwon told the community that “spreading falsehood” adds to the pain of all LUNA investors, remarking that:

“I didn’t say much because I don’t want to seem like playing victim, but I lost most of what I had in the crash too. I’ve said this multiple times but I really don’t care about money much.”

Mr. B, a developer from Anchor Protocol — a Terra-centric sub-ecosystem — allegedly warned Kwon about the unrealistic high-interest rates. Mr. B said that the platform was designed only to offer an interest rate of 3.6% for keeping the Terra ecosystem stable but was changed to 20% just before the release:

“I thought it was going to collapse from the beginning (I designed it), but it collapsed 100%.”
The developer allegedly suggested to Kwon about lowering the interest rates but the request was refused. Do Kwon has been summoned to attend a parliamentary hearing on the matter in South Korea."

# Ethereum difficulty bomb delayed but network adoption still growing

Ethereum network developers have decided to delay the difficulty bomb, a major step leading up to the highly anticipated Merge upgrade for the layer-1 blockchain.

They set the delay to two months in order to “be sure that we sanity check all the numbers before selecting an exact delay and deployment time” according to core developer Tim Beiko in a June 11 tweet.

There are also no press releases or announcements related to the NFT solution on Alibaba’s website anymore, and while the solution’s webpage link still shows up in Google search results, it now redirects to Alibaba Cloud’s solution index page.

he difficulty bomb will be a measure to disincentivize ETH mining operations from keeping their physical mining devices running as the network transitions from proof-of-work (PoW) to [proof-of-stake](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained) (PoS).

It dramatically increases the difficulty for miners to verify transactions on the network, thus reducing profitability for PoW miners. Eventually, it will become impossible for physical miners to validate a block. The difficulty bomb is a [feature of the network](https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-serenity-the-solution-to-ethereums-difficulty-bomb) added to the code in 2016 as plans for the Merge to become the Consensus Layer (formerly known as ETH 2.0) were being formed.

Transitioning to PoS should reduce the [Ethereum network’s energy demands](https://cointelegraph.com/news/99-98-less-power-lighthouse-s-first-ethereum-and-eth2-merge-transaction) by up to 99.9% according to some estimates. Other PoS networks such as Polygon and Fantom Opera, boast negligible power demands compared to other PoW networks.

Although Beiko does not mention it, delaying the difficulty bomb could lead to further delays for the Merge itself, which is expected to take place in August 2022.cointelegraph.com

# ‘The metaverse will empower human beings’, declares Qatar Airways

Qatar Airways [announced](https://cointelegraph.com.br/news/qatar-airways-enters-the-metaverse-and-announces-the-worlds-first-metahuman-cabin-crew) Tuesday that it had launched its first metaverse experience, QVerse. This virtual reality platform allows interested parties can virtually visit and navigate the Premium Check-in area at the International Airport of Hamad (HIA).

According to the company's statements to Cointelegraph however, QVerse is merely the company's first foray into the metaverse. The company said that it intends to expand its virtual environment initiatives and believes that the metaverse is part of the future of human relations.

According to the company, its entry into the metaverse reflects its passengers desire for “immersive content that can empower their decision-making before buying a ticket, and are often eager to discover the aircraft they will fly.”

Last year Qatar Airways [became the first airline](https://www.unlock-bc.com/news/2021-03-21/qatar-airlines-joins-emirates-and-etihad-in-trialing-iata-blockchain-enabled-travel-pass/) in the Middle East to adopt the IATA Blockchain 'Digital Passport', in partnership with the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Recently, the US Air Force also announced its entry into the metaverse and filed a trademark application for an initiative called [SpaceVerse](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=97363265&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch).

# NFT flipping not so profitable for more than half of buyers: Survey

With the surging popularity of [nonfungible tokens (NFTs)](https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners), many have taken to “flipping” these assets as a trading strategy. Around 64% of people in a recent survey said their top reason for buying an NFT was “to make money.”

Blockchain monitoring software company DEXterlab [polled](https://dexterlab.com/why-people-buy-nfts-dexterlab-survey/) more than 1,300 people on Twitter about their NFT buying habits from late May to early June. Despite a majority looking to gain from NFT trading, less than 42% have made a profit so far, according to the results.

The second most cited reason for buying an NFT saw around 15% respond that it was to be part of a community and “to flex.”

“People are highly social creatures, so the desire to be a part of a community and show off isn’t really surprising,” DEXterlab wrote.

Web5 announced by Jack Dorsey’s Block to replace web3 as future of internet 

the evolution of the web

TBD believes that the evolution of the internet puts “individuals at the center.” In the first web version, most of the content was static HTML except for forums and chat protocols such as IRC. The social media evolution led to what is known as web2 and allowed users to interact with centralized applications such as Facebook.

Twitter and MySpace to create their own content and share information in real-time. With the invention of Bitcoin and blockchain, the world is now moving towards web3, which centers around decentralized applications using zero-knowledge proofs to secure data, tokenized content, and protect users’ identities.

While web3 has yet to establish itself as the dominant technology of the internet, Jack Dorsey believes it is already time for a change. This change comes from what he calls web5, which will be built on top of Bitcoin, where data is stored with the user, not the application. The amalgamation of web2 and web3 creates web5 for those confused about where web4 went. The slide below illustrates the difference between the current internet and web5. cryptoslate.com

# Validator Wars: New LUNA validators accused of unethical behavior

LUNA [**validators**](https://twitter.com/pfc_validator/status/1534838207493263360) PFC, Lavender.Five and Red Herring have called out new validators to raise the commission levels from 0% to 20% without informing their delegators. According to [**Larry,**](https://twitter.com/larry0x/status/1532737379643056128) a developer from Delphi Digital, LUNA validators can earn up to $192k annually after receiving the genesis delegator attribution of 2.5M LUNA.

## Multiple validator nodes

Aside from the validators increasing commission without informing their communities, Red Herring also [**identified**](https://twitter.com/R3d_Herring/status/1534571947610107904) three other validators, “Luna Whale, Lunatic Validator, and Long Live Luna,” for unethical behavior. Red Herring detailed the setup of each of the three validators and noticed the similarities:

**– No logo**  
 **– Generic Luna related names**  
 **– 20% commission**  
 **– Max commission change rate of 20%**  
 **– No website/social media presence/email contact**

Red Herring then checked the on-chain data for each of the validators’ wallets. Each of the wallets transferred its commissions to the same wallet, “terra1hm4w,” and then onto a final wallet, “terra1kl6e,” after collecting the tokens. The LUNA held by these validators is without any vesting schedule. The validators have taken advantage of the genesis distribution of LUNA tokens to set up multiple validators.

3 reasons Ethereum price risks 25% downside in June,BigONE_Official,vb8meu,2022-06-13 06:00:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigONE_Official/comments/vb8meu/3_reasons_ethereum_price_risks_25_downside_in_june/,AutoModerator,,"A mix of on-chain, fundamental and technical factors suggests more pain for Ether bulls ahead.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) has dropped more than half of its value in 2022 in dollar terms, while also losing value against Bitcoin (BTC) and now remains pinned below $2,000 for several reasons.

What’s more, ETH price could face even bigger losses in June due to another slew of factors, which will be discussed below. 

Investors have withdrawn $250 million out of Ethereum-based investment funds in 2022, according to CoinShares’ weekly market report published May 31.

The massive outflow appears in contrast to other coins. For instance, investors have poured $369 million into Bitcoin-based investment funds in 2022.

Meanwhile, Solana and Cardano, layer-one blockchain protocols competing with Ethereum, have attracted $104 million and $9 million, respectively.

The withdrawals from Ethereum funds are a sign of how the recent crash in TerraUSD (UST) and Terra (LUNA) — tokens within Terra's algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem — has dampened interest in the overall decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

ETH’s bullish prospects remain glued to anticipations of a boom in the DeFi market, because Ethereum’s blockchain host a majority of financial applications in the sector. As of June 5, the total valued locked (TVL) inside the Ethereum-based apps was $68.71 million, almost 65% of the total DeFi TVL.

But, the TVL still reflects a massive retreat from Ethereum’s DeFi pools, which, before the collapse of Luna Classic (LUNC) and TerraUSD Classic (USTC) on May 9, was hovering around $100 billion.

With macro risks led by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies, coupled with a cautious outlook around the DeFi sector, Ether looks poised to continue its decline in June, according to Ilan Solot, a partner at Tagus Capital.

He told the Financial Times:

“If the Federal Reserve is tightening, the world is in recession, and people need to pay $4.5 per gallon of gas, they’ll have less to invest in DeFi or spend on blockchain games.”
Sluggish technicals

In detail, Ether has been fluctuating inside a range defined by a horizontal trendline support and a falling trendline resistance. The pattern looks more or less like a “descending triangle,” a bearish continuation pattern when formed during a downtrend.

As a rule of technical analysis, descending triangles resolve after the price breaks decisively below their support trendline and then falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height. Ether risks undergoing a similar downside move in June, as shown in the chart below.

If ETH’s price breaks below the triangle’s lower trendline, it risks falling toward $1,350 in June, down about 25% from today's price.

The total number of Ether balances at crypto exchanges globally has increased by 550,459 ETH since May, data from CryptoQuant shows.

That amounts to almost $950 million worth of inflows into the exchanges’ hot wallets since the beginning of the Terra debacle.

Typically, traders send tokens to exchanges when they want to trade them for other assets. Thus, selling pressure would likely increase if the downtrend in ETH reserves on exchanges begins to reverse."
"The crypto market dropped in May, but June has a silver lining",BigONE_Official,v815cc,2022-06-08 18:00:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigONE_Official/comments/v815cc/the_crypto_market_dropped_in_may_but_june_has_a/,AutoModerator,,"The top 10 largest whale addresses of stablecoins DAI and USDC show an increased trust level in the two assets amid the UST debacle.

May 2022 was not for the faint-hearted. Even the most embattled and experienced crypto traders were tested in the first two weeks of the month on a brutal drop following the United States Federal Reserve’s announcement that interest rates would be rising by 0.5%.

Crypto used to exhibit a lower correlation with real-world events and was generally unaffected by capitalistic successes and failures. However, a very steady approximate peg between Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 index was seen throughout the first five months of 2022. Inflation and war fears have not been kind to both markets either.

Crypto mimicking the equity market could be due to the massive market capitalization growth in 2020 and 2021. At unprecedented rates, retail investors from equities have flocked to cryptocurrencies, causing a far greater overlap in price movements.

Bitcoin dipped below $29,000 before coming back up to $31,800 on May 31, while Ether (ETH) fell to just above $1,700 before reclaiming prices above $1,900 by May 30. But many altcoins fared far worse, and the resulting reactions from once-patient traders turned to about as much FUD as one would imagine.

Four stablecoins, two different directions

TerraUSD (UST) — now known as TerraUSD Classic (USTC) — was a stablecoin built on the Terra blockchain and sitting in the top six stablecoins by market cap. However, on May 9, the coin, which was designed to maintain a $1 value all the time, progressively dropped down to $0.29, leaving the crypto world in shock. Its price has not recovered since.

As for how this impacted the rest of the stablecoin landscape, a major “shuffling of the deck” resulted from a trusted stablecoin’s reputation imploding overnight. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market cap, saw a fall of its own, albeit one much less drastic, to $0.95. It has since recovered, but there have been renewed claims about the coin’s solvency.

Dai (DAI) and USD Coin (USDC) seemed to reap the reward amid the debacle as the above chart clearly indicates the top 10 largest whale addresses from each stablecoin show an increased trust level in these two assets, and coins moving in massive waves onto exchanges from USDT and UST (now TerraUSD Classic). Binance USD (BUSD) also can’t be ignored, as the third-largest stablecoin grew to a nearly $19-billion market cap last month.

LUNA’s tragic fall from grace

UST’s sister token LUNA Classic (LUNC) — the updated name for the original LUNA token — plunged from its all-time high of about $119 just seven weeks ago and now sits at a staggering $0.000125, equating to a -99.9999% decrease in price and market cap. UST’s depegging from $1 appeared to be the final nail in the coffin as the algorithm wasn’t swift enough to burn LUNC when UST was in freefall due to large withdrawals on the Anchor Protocol."
Terra 2.0: A crypto project built on the ruins of $40 billion in investors' money,BigONE_Official,v7szd2,2022-06-08 12:00:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigONE_Official/comments/v7szd2/terra_20_a_crypto_project_built_on_the_ruins_of/,AutoModerator,,"Terra 2.0 launced with the promise of helping to retrieve lost funds, but early indicators suggest launching a new token to compensate for the failure of another is a bad idea.

Terra remained the focus of the majority of headlines throughout May for its spiral collapse leading to a loss of over $40 billion in investors’ money. Despite some early resistance from the community and heavy backlash from the likes of Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Terra co-founder Do Kwon managed to relaunch the collapsed network with a new chain called Terra 2.0 (Phoenix-1).

The amended proposal for the relaunch of the network by increasing the genesis liquidity, which introduces a new liquidity profile for pre-attack Luna Classic (LUNC) holders and decreases the distribution to post-attack TerraUSD Classic (USTC) holders, was approved by the community with a 65% vote in favor.

The new blockchain went live on May 28 after a hard fork. The new token stays Terra (LUNA) and the old one was rebranded to Luna Classic. With the new network launch, the holders of LUNC, USTC and Anchor Protocol UST (aUST) were eligible to receive the new tokens.

Despite industry-wide outrage against Do Kwon — the co-founder and the parent company Terraform Labs are facing lawsuits and investigations in South Korea — major crypto exchanges including Binance, Kucoin, FTX, Bitfinex and several others announced support for the Terra 2.0 chain.

Cointelegraph reached out to Binance to inquire about the reasoning behind its listing of the LUNC on its platform, especially when the market is still recovering from the after-effects of the $40 billion collapse. A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph:

“Binance listed LUNA on the Innovation Zone, which is a dedicated trading zone where users can trade new tokens that may have increased volatility and pose a higher risk than other tokens. Before being able to trade on the Innovation Zone, every user has to visit the web version of the Innovation Zone trading page and complete a questionnaire after reading the Binance Terms of Use.”
Binance claimed that the purpose of the Terra 2.0 was to compensate those who had lost a significant amount of funds during the crash of the main network. As a platform, “Binance decided to let people trade the airdropped tokens to realize their assets.”

CZ has also said that he is not very optimistic about the future of the Terra 2.0 ecosystem and that the decision to list the new token was based on helping investors recover some of their losses. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Zhao said:

“We still need to ensure continuity of people's access to liquidity. We have to support the revival plan hoping that it may work.”
Kraken CEO Jesse Powell also defended listing LUNA, saying it’s the community’s demand. However, he did mention that a listing doesn’t necessarily equal an endorsement for the controversial token.

Customer satisfaction seems to be a common concern for the continued listing fo the asset. Bitrue crypto exchange research analyst Whitney Setiawan told Cointelegraph:

“As an exchange, Bitrue’s main priority is customer satisfaction, as it’s only right that we give our Bitruers the freedom to invest in assets of their choice. We are still closely monitoring developments from the Luna Foundation Guard investigation and would take immediate action should the situation get worse.”
Terra 2.0 sees heavy volatility

The launch of the new network was nothing less than a frenzy. To begin with, many investors claimed that they were not appropriately compensated for the new airdrop. The Terra 2.0 team acknowledged the issue and said they are working to resolve the issue soon.

Many users also joked about how the new airdrop is a mockery, given that people have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and received about $50 worth of new tokens in return.

The new airdropped token started trading across multiple crypto exchanges on May 28. However, as warned by many, the new token showed very high price volatility on the very first day of the relaunch, dropping by over 70%. Many investors who received the new LUNA started selling as soon as they received it, showing a lack of confidence in the new ecosystem.

LUNA was listed for $18.85 on the relaunch day but subsequently plummeted to $5.71 before recovering half of its losses a day before the Binance listing. The token is currently trading at $6.44, according to Cointelegraph data, nearly one-third of its listing price.

Justin Hartzman, CEO of crypto trading platform Coinsmart, told Cointelegraph, “Precaution is always better than cure. Why list a project with some very noticeable flaws, noted by many well-known folks on Twitter, and then ignore them? Exchanges must make their listing process more secure and rigid. Too much money and too many lives are at stake here.”

A user who reportedly lost a significant amount of money investing in LUNC wrote:

“I don’t see any fundamentals here & I see whatever I get as a bonus since I already wrote everything off as a loss & $0. If not that the others are vesting, I’ll sell ‘em all.”
Do Kwon has a track record of failed projects

There is a famous meme going around on Crypto Twitter that compares the fate of two fund managers, who each lost investors billions of dollars. One is Bernie Madoff, the notorious financier who was sentenced to 150 years in prison after running a $60 billion Ponzi scheme — the world’s largest — and Do Kwon, who managed to relaunch a new network just two weeks after losing billions of dollars.

The meme highlights the lack of regulatory oversight in the crypto space, where multi-billion-dollar mistakes and scams have little to no checks or balances. 

Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin collapse was not the first time Kwon has launched a failed experimental project. At the peak of the Terra collapse saga, it was revealed that Do Kwon was also behind another failed stablecoin project called Basis Cash (BAC).

Many experts also believe that even though exchanges are liable to listen to the community and list the new token, a future project led by Do Kwon would be hard to accept. Zachary Greene, who runs crypto-investing and finance website the Greenery Financial, told Cointelegraph:

“I believe Do Kwon heading operations will hold Terra 2.0 from being accepted and seen as a legitimate reboot. Whether he was responsible for the mismanagement of the reserves or not, he seems to be blamed by the community and crypto space for the disaster that was the collapse of LUNC and USTC. In my opinion, any project with him as the lead, at least for the next few years, will be dogged on by the crypto community.”
The Terra and Terra 2.0 story is still unfolding. Whether anything malicious happened with the stablecoin or if it was just a failed experiment, only time will tell. 

Even in traditional markets, however, we’ve seen time and time again how failed executives hop from one executive position to another. It’s not shocking to see Do Kwon at the helm of Terra 2.0, but it should definitely make investors pause and think twice before investing.

What makes the case against Kwon is his reluctance to foresee the problems and act accordingly. Many have been warning against USTC’s peg being backed by volatile assets and Terra using community funds to buy Bitcoin (BTC), but most of it went unnoticed amid tall promises from the project’s management.

The Terra co-founder and the majority of the employees at Terraform Labs is currently under investigation on various charges including tax evasion, market manipulation and more. While the community can’t be blamed for approving the relaunch plan since they hoped to recover some of their funds with the airdrop, Kwon’s leading the charge once again could prove problematic for the community in the long term."
Terra's Luna 2.0 has a sluggish start following the failure of its cryptocurrency.,VIPSFinstockCommunity,v633sv,2022-06-06 09:05:49,2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPSFinstockCommunity/comments/v633sv/terras_luna_20_has_a_sluggish_start_following_the/,vipsfinstockofficial,,"The relaunch of Terra's new Luna token has had a sluggish start, failing to impress the investors who received the new tokens following the collapse of the cryptocurrencies linked to the failed Terra blockchain last month.

The original Terra Chain has been rebranded as Terra Classic, and Terra has been relaunched as Terra 2.0, after the developers of the failed stablecoin TerraUSD voted to abandon the token in favour of developing a new blockchain and digital asset weeks after the cryptocurrency collapsed.

The original blockchain has been renamed Terra Classic, while Luna, which fell close to zero last month, has been renamed Luna Classic with the ticker LUNC. There is no stablecoin on the new Terra blockchain.

According to data compiled by tracker Kaiko, the average price of the Luna 2.0 token has remained below $11 in the last week since they were distributed by Terra.

While there is no widely accepted data point to calculate a market value for Luna 2.0, data tracker CoinMarketCap estimates the total value at around $1.37 billion. According to Bloomberg, there are 210 million new Luna tokens in circulation, based on the amounts claimed by the Terra project's administrators.

""The airdrop was extremely poorly organised."" It rewarded equity holders – LUNA holders – more than savers or bondholders, anchor depositors or UST holders ""According to Thomas Dunleavy, a senior analyst at crypto research firm Messari. ""Any cryptocurrency network is built on trust, not only by users but also by builders who invest their time and money to grow the network.""

On May 6, Luna had a market value of about $27.8 billion before it crashed. UST was created to keep its dollar peg by utilising both algorithms and trading incentives involving Luna.

Unlike most other major stablecoins, TerraUSD's value was determined by complex algorithmic processes and is linked to another paired token called Luna.

The price of Terra (LUNA) has tanked around 70% since the re-launch of the Terra ecosystem via Terra 2.0 on May 28.

Under the revival plan of Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, new LUNA tokens, also referred to as LUNA 2, are being airdropped to investors that previously held Luna Classic (LUNC), TerraUSD Classic (USTC) and Anchor Protocol UST (aUST).

According to data from CoinGecko, LUNA has dropped roughly 69% since its opening of $18.87 on Saturday to sit at around $5.71 at the time of writing.

At this stage, the sharp plummet seems to suggest a relative lack of faith in Do Kwon’s revamp moving forward, with many investors indicating on Twitter that they are instead looking to recover a small portion of their previously lost capital and wipe their hands clean of the project.

Binance is set to begin a multi-year distribution of LUNA to eligible users starting from May 31, along with listing the token for trading via its Innovation Zone, a dedicated trading zone for volatile and high-risk assets.

Some people in the community who have outlined plans to eventually purchase LUNA once the carnage is over such as “lurkaroundfind” have predicted further bloodshed once the Binance drop goes live.

They pointed out that Binance has “15.7MM liquid LUNA, which will be available to users on Tuesday,” and suggested that investors who mainly used the Anchor Protocol will look to cash out as they have no real interest in the Terra ecosystem.

Popular influencers in the space such as Lark Davis have also noted such, telling his 988,000 Twitter follows yesterday that:

“Zero plans to buy $luna 2.0, but I will dump any airdrop if I get something on Binance.”"

How we can restore Terra Classic using what I actually learned from the Terra meltdown,CryptoCurrency,v1lr6i,2022-05-31 04:46:34,0,0.45,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v1lr6i/how_we_can_restore_terra_classic_using_what_i/,tobbelobb69,PERSPECTIVE,"I am nought but a pleb who held some UST, but like many in this position I learned a really expensive lesson over the past weeks. They say we had our warnings, and I guess we did, but we kept moving forward believing that those with the power to do something would choose to do the right thing. How naive. We should have known that those who *can* screw us over for a profit *will* screw us over for a profit.

However, it looks to me like we were a little off the mark regarding where the problem with the old system actually was. Below is a cherry picked quote from a comment I made regarding the relationship between UST and LUNA back in March.

>You are completely right that an exit rush from UST will crash the price of LUNA.

This prediction was pretty 10/10, but no one is surprised. What surprised some of us, myself included, is how far below peg UST fell. Still, the theory was borderline holding up, because as LUNA kept plummeting, UST was kind of showing signs of recovery from time to time. That’s where things stopped going according to plan B, because it turns out that Terra had a conflict of interests. On one hand, the selling point of Terra was the stablecoins integrated into the very protocol, but on the other hand, governance was completely in the hands of LUNA holders, not stablecoin holders. As LUNA price predictably plummeted from the excessive minting necessary to burn all that UST, the blockchain was stopped. This was too little too late for all the OG LUNA holders, but it served to make sure UST holders were completely screwed as well.

What can we learn from this? Mainly that backing a stablecoin through minting of a *governance token* is not a great idea. The fact that LUNA is a governance token caused two major problems. First, that governors have incentive to screw stablecoin holders by implementing proposals that protect their own interests. Second, that the excessive minting of governance tokens makes the protocol vulnerable to governance attacks.

So, what can we do to save what is left of Terra now? Let’s not forget that the value proposition of Terra is the stablecoins, without those it’s just a plain L1 with relatively low fees. However, to unite stablecoin holders and LUNC holders we need to rework the core mechanism so that it’s not designed to screw either group for the sake of the other. I propose a solution similar to the model used by Ripae Finance, where a “bonded token” is used to eat the sell pressure on the stablecoins. In short, it works like this:

* We already have LUNC and UST, but we need to add bUST.
* 1 UST can be burned to mint 1 bUST.
* 1 bUST can be burned to mint 1 UST, but only when UST price is at least 1.000 USD.
* LUNC can also be burned to mint UST, but only when UST price is at least 1.001 USD.
* UST cannot be used to mint LUNC.
* LUNC is minted as a staking reward, and used for governance.
* The other stablecoins will also have their own bToken.

With the simple logic above, we have eliminated the threat of excessive LUNC minting, while still providing a mechanism to burn our stablecoins when demand drops. The incentive to mint and hold bUST lies in the profit to be made when UST regains peg. As you can see, this proposal provides a road to recovery for the current UST, as the bUST mechanism can be implemented, and burning of UST resumed. In turn, this will also provide value for LUNC holders, as the trust in the Terra (Classic) stablecoin is rebuilt, and the network regains its strategic advantage over Terra 2.0, and other random L1s for that matter."

The recovery plan for Terraform Labs’ stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its native token Terra (LUNA) embarked on a bumpy route after the LUNA 2.0 cryptocurrency suffered a substantial market fall hours after its launch.

TerraForm Labs successfully delivered new LUNA coins to market participants holding LUNA Classic (LUNAC) and TerraUSD (UST). According to data from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, LUNA began trading at $0.5 and quickly rose to a high of $30 before dropping by more than 88% to $3.5.

 LUNA 2.0 Price Surged 5,900% On Saturday, May 28, the LUNA price surged 5,900% to a new all-time high of $30. Unfortunately, this spectacular rise was short-lived. The price soon reversed and dropped 88%, resulting in a swing low of $3.50.

LUNA 2.0’s price increased quickly after it hit $3.5, reaching $10.22 before staying at $6 for the last two days. As this coiling up continues, there is a good chance that Terra bulls may come together and cause a big rally.

 LUNA is currently trading above $8 with a 1.36% increase. | Source: LUNA/USD price chart from Tradingview.com People are bullish on LUNA because assets usually go back to their average after a big move. LUNA’s price went down 88% recently. But it will probably go back up just as quickly because the decline was so sharp. Although, some members of the Terra community speculated that LUNA 2.0 would cost between $30 and $50 when it was released. Therefore, investors are outraged by the current price movement. Due to Terra’s LUNA and UST death spiral, they continue to suffer losses.

Due to Saturday’s airdrop, the LUNA 2.0 price is consolidating below the middle of the newly formed trading range. As a result, investors should be patient before opening new trading positions and wait for a directional bias to develop.

 Do Kwon Blamed For Market Crash Do Kwon has been the center of attention since the fall, with some in the crypto community blaming him for the market crash. He faces accusations that he engaged in fraud leading up to Mirror Protocol, too!

LUNA continued to lose money after the collapse, with its market capitalization slipping below $1 billion. But surprisingly, the crash sparked interest in LUNA, with Google search popularity ratings skyrocketing.

The collapsed token became popular because some people were very optimistic and put in more money. This made the token’s price go up quickly. But according to market analysts, the interest in the token was due to the hope that it would be like other meme coins, like Dogecoin.

According to Do Kwon’s original plan for a new blockchain, the aftermath of the UST peg failure was an opportunity to come up afresh from the ashes.

**What Exactly Is Terra 2.0 (LUNA)?**  
Terra (LUNA) is a public blockchain protocol based on Terra Classic. Terra Classic is the home of TerraClassicUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin (UST). It's now known as the LUNC token collateralized UST, and it was crashed in a bank run in May 2022. This effectively devalued LUNA and prompted the establishment of a new chain, resulting in Terra Classic and Terra.  


**What Sets Terra 2.0 Apart?**  
Terra will continue to operate in the absence of its algorithmic stablecoin UST, with hundreds of developers working on various decentralized applications. The LUNA token will be distributed to Luna Classic stakeholders, holders, residual UST holders, and Terra Classic app developers. Terra Foundation Labs' wallet was removed for the airdrop event, making Terra a completely community-owned chain.  


**Who Are Terra's Founders?**  
Daniel Shin and Do Kwon founded Terra in January 2018. The project was conceived by the two as a way to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency by focusing on price stability and usability. Kwon was named CEO of Terraform Labs, the company that created Terra.

Shin previously co-founded and led Ticket Monster, also known as TMON, a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He went on to co-found Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator that works with entrepreneurs to build fully functional businesses.

Kwon previously founded and led Anyfi, a startup that offers decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked for Microsoft and Apple as a software engineer.  
Following the collapse of Terra Classic, Do Kwon announced a revival plan, which resulted in the hard fork of Terra Classic and Terra. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Vitalik Buterin, as well as disgruntled UST investors, criticized his plans. His proposal was approved by the community, and on May 27, 2022, Terra Classic hard forked into its new Terra blockchain.

💡What is LUNA？

Terra (LUNA) is a public blockchain protocol that emerged from Terra Classic. Terra Classic is home to the algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (UST). It's now-renamed LUNC token collateralized UST, which crashed in a bank run in May 2022. That devalued LUNA to virtually zero and caused a launch of a new chain — resulting in Terra Classic and Terra.

## What is Terra 2.0?

Terra 2.0 is a decentralized, open-source public blockchain protocol resulting from a community-supported separation of the original Terra blockchain. Born from the Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan 2 and built with interoperability in mind, the Terra 2.0 network will inherit Terra Classic’s developer pool. LUNA2 is the native token used for governance of the network.
