A different way to look at fat burning and muscle loss,fasting,1i9xfzn,2025-01-25 16:23:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1i9xfzn/a_different_way_to_look_at_fat_burning_and_muscle/,PurpleCustomer9791,Discussion,"Hi,

I've been lurking here for a while, but wanted to share something that rang a clear bell in mind about how our bodies actually burn fat. I just completed a 15 day fast (longest fast I've done) and am down 19lbs, feeling amazing too after a couple rough days where i didn't have my hydration and electrolytes in check yet. Anyway, while doing my usual routine of obsessing about details and diving deeper into the subject, I stumbled onto something that I wish I'd known during my previous fasts.¬†

Turns out there's a scientific limit to how fast your body can actually burn fat, this feels kind of obvious in a way bit is rarely part of the discussion as far as I have seen. When I did a little math with this info the results surprised me and it changed how I'm approaching fasting.

¬†Quick background on me: I'm 260 lbs, about 40% body fat (working on it), and I keep seeing ¬†conflicting advice and practices about exercise during fasting. Some people seem to keep working out fairly hard, others tend to just rest or get low exercise and there are always tons of questions on how to handle it. I found that kernel of information really crystallized it for me, so I thought I‚Äôd share.

¬†Your body can only burn fat at a certain speed - like a pipe that can only let so much water through. For each pound of fat you have, you can burn about 31 calories from it per day (science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45, I believe the high end would be when you are very overweight and have plenty of easily accessible fat). That's not a ""daily allowance"" you can save up - it's more like a speed limit you can't break.

Here's how it breaks using myself as an example:

\* I've got about 104 lbs of fat (260 √ó 40%)

\* Each pound can release 31 calories per day maximum(assuming 31 as the rate)

\* That means I can burn up to 3,224 calories from fat per day

\* Breaking it down further: that's about 134 calories per hour(the speed limit, not a cumulative total), but this isn‚Äôt all available for you to spend, you have to subtract your basal metabolic rate first.

\* Or about 2.2 calories per minute

¬†**The Muscle Loss Warning**

Here's the important part - if you push past your fat-burning limit, your body doesn't just magically find more fat to burn. Instead, it goes ""Oh, you need more energy? Let me grab that from your muscles real quick."" Not exactly what most of us are aiming for.

¬†Think of it like this: Your fat stores are like a slow-drip IV that can only deliver a certain amount of energy per hour. If you suddenly need more energy than that drip can provide (like during an intense workout), your body has to find that extra energy somewhere. Guess what's protein-rich and full of energy? Your muscles.

¬†Some real numbers to put this in perspective:

\* Let's say I go for an intense workout that burns 600 calories in an hour

\* My fat can only provide 134 calories that hour

\* My base metabolism needs about 100 calories that hour(you need to figure this number out, calculators all over the internet)

\* That leaves a 366-calorie deficit

\* Those calories HAVE to come from somewhere - hello, muscle breakdown

¬†

It's actually worse than just losing muscle mass. When your body breaks down muscle for energy, it:

\* Is less efficient than burning fat

\* Can stress your kidneys (they have to process the broken-down muscle protein)

\* Makes you feel like garbage (that workout ""high"" quickly becomes a crash)

\* Can take longer to recover from

¬†

What This Actually Means

My body needs about 2,400 calories just to keep me alive each day (BMR). That leaves me roughly 824 calories (3,224 - 2,400) for extra activity. Spread across 24 hours, that's about 34 calories per hour for exercise or whatever. The 34 kcal per hour during sleeping is lost capacity.

¬†If I burn an extra 34 calories per hour during waking hours on top of my BMR (2,400 kcal/day), my total daily energy expenditure would be approximately¬†**2,944 calories per day**. This would result in burning about¬†**0.84 pounds of fat per day- anything above this means burning muscle.**

**It's important to remember that the less fat you have, the lower these thresholds become.**

¬†At first I was disappointed that this number is so low, it gives me a very minimal overhead for exercise. But it explains why:

\* People lose muscle when they exercise too hard while fasting

\* Some folks feel great with light walking but crash after gym sessions

\* You can't ""make up"" for a lazy day with one intense workout, you don‚Äôt get to ‚Äúsave up‚Äù unused fat energy, it‚Äôs an on demand system with a limt.

¬†

¬†The Numbers

For every pound of fat you have:

\* 31 calories per day(again, science backs a rate of 22-31kcal per pound per day, there is some belief it can be as high as 45)

\* 1.29 calories per hour

\* 0.022 calories per minute(realistically this is the most pertinent number)

¬†Multiply those by your pounds of fat to get your limits. Just remember your body needs its baseline calories first (BMR), and what's left is w

To be clear about the muscle thing: you'll always lose a tiny bit of muscle during any fast, but the goal is to minimize it. Staying under your fat-burning limit helps do that. The really aggressive muscle loss happens when you push too hard and force your body to break down muscle for fuel, I for one don't want to go lift weights just to lose muscle...¬†Exercise is important to let your body know to protect the muscle, because you are still using it, but there are clear limits.

I‚Äôve probably made some mistakes in here and obviously there are probably some more factors that could be accounted for, like a lower BMR while fasting, differences in BMR from day to night, and rounding to the hour not being super representational‚Ä¶ But I would love to hear what people think of this.

Thanks

Lore Expert Advice Needed - Guidance on Ritual to Raise Obox-ob from Zionyn,DnD,1i9xfmq,2025-01-25 16:23:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1i9xfmq/lore_expert_advice_needed_guidance_on_ritual_to/,No-Dragonfruit-1311,5th Edition,"Okay, so I've been brewing this idea for a while and am admittedly not a lore expert so am hoping for some suggestions. The goal is to fold the idea of this ritual to raise Obox-ob from his banishment in Zionyn into a homebrew Abyssal campaign.  
  
The Ritual Concept: Obox-ob resents his placement in Zionyn and wishes to return to a seat of greater power, to once again rival the other demon lords. Obox-ob learns via his Abyssal Cult's High Priests that a rite rooted in harnessing the power of the eight schools of magic will give him the power needed. He uncovers connections between each of the eight magical school and a particular powerful being. To access the power of the schools of magic he must conquer other great demon lords and archdevils, including (finally) the Pale Night, Mother of all Demons.  
  
Story Setup: Obox-ob has already defeated, captured, or turned six fiendish lords, thereby harnessed or in the midst of harnessing the magic from their particular school (they are: Akelarre/Abjuration, Orcus/Conjuration, Divination/Dispater, Ereshkigal/Enchantment, Hecate/Evocation, & Hel/Transmutation). The Pale Night is tied to Illusion and Obox-ob himself is the eighth school, Necromancy. The reason for selecting such powerful creatures is that by ""conquering"" them, Obox-ob would arguably wield enough power to then defeat the Pale Night to prove his supremacy and return ""to the fold"" as it were.  
(Note: I came to these determinations based on brief looks at many fiends and their stories. The Pale Night seems obvious as she is cloaked in illusion because reality itself wishes to conceal her form. She is also symbolic of birth, while Obox would symbol death. There are obviously tons of fiends who relate to necromancy so I looked beyond the obvious to find suitable links. I am not opposed to changing fiend/magic assignments where appropriate.)

The Campaign: The PCs will not directly be engaged with any of these powerful beings but instead attempt to disrupt the ritual as a means to provide themselves a way to escape the Abyssal ""hole"" they've plummeted into. Obox-ob's Abyssal Cult has erected a monument to his power, one that spans the planes and exists beyond the laws of time and space. This is where the story takes place for our PCs. They will be tasked with revealing their reason for being brought ""here"" and in doing so will uncover hints about the ritual and the War that would result, thus ending life as they know it and unleashing the Demon Lord of Vermin upon all the planes. So they'll have a choice, find a way home directly, or disrupt the plot.   
If they choose the latter, stopping the ritual involves destroying three totems to Obox-ob's power and defeating his Abyssal High Priests. I had thought to make the totems physical constructs made from the bodies of three of the six evil entities but are they too powerful to meet that kind of end? Even in a homebrewed world? Would avatars be a better choice? Totems made from some other beings, lesser servants? Totems that are more symbols than anything? For example: the totem tied to Dispater (Divination) I'd thought maybe the construct was formed when Dispater's servant Bitru was captured along with droves of his erinyes troops. Frozen/petrified until a key could be used to destroy the devil thus suffusing Obox-ob with his liege-lord's power.

I addition to feedback about the ritual and the magical school/creatures ties, I'm looking for ideas on streamlining this idea or...honestly, whatever the minds of this sub come up with. I know this is convoluted but the idea was to provide a lot of latitude to a group who is interested in solving the greater mystery.

TL;DR - looking for help assigning 6 powerful fiends to the different schools of magic (excluding Illusion/Pale Night, Mother of Demons and Necromancy/Obox-ob) to fuel a ritual of return for the Demon Lord of Vermin. This is a backdrop for a homebrew campaign (read above for more).

Thanks in advance!"
Are there any good straight swords for bleed?,Eldenring,1i9xfki,2025-01-25 16:23:16,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1i9xfki/are_there_any_good_straight_swords_for_bleed/,PinkThunder138,Discussion & Info,"It seems like most of the bleed swords are either katanas or great swords.

I've used greatswords on my previous build (frost and magic) so I want to do something different. I'm not into the feel of daggers, and I plan for my next build to be like a samurai type. For this one I'm aiming for more of a Celtic warrior with some magic, which says straight sword and staff to me. 

Or maybe there's another fun build I can do with a straight sword like black flame, or rot or something?"
First experience w/ Jumpspeak (not great!),languagelearning,1i9xe27,2025-01-25 16:21:24,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1i9xe27/first_experience_w_jumpspeak_not_great/,shriramk,Discussion,"I recently learned about Jumpstart. I've used Duolingo, Mango, Pimsleur, etc. quite a bit in the past and I'm also using Duolingo now. I've been making my own LLM prompts to create lessons, and figured I was happy to outsource the job.

In my first half hour I'm already very disappointed by *many* things.

1. It seems very difficult to get a price up front from their Web site. That's always a bad sign.

2. When you click on buttons like ""Try 100 days"", you go through an extremely long, irritating, frustrating, sequence of questions and interactions, none of which seem to have any real value *at all*. For instance, after I did what seemed like a ""what is your level"" quiz (and did very well on), there was absolutely no feedback, nor was there any customization when I actually started using the app. It became clear that this is whole process is a bunch of crappy behavioral psychology tricks, not anything tied to learning.

3. After I initiated the payment process, I kept getting several ""upsell"" pages. After two of these I got really annoyed and bailed out of completing the signup process entirely. I even got an email from Jumpspeak: subject ""Can I help?"" and text:

> It looks like you were right in the middle of signing up for our special.
>
> But it appears you didn‚Äôt get a chance to finish the checkout process.

etc., with a link to ""fill out the order form and finish your order"" (which I had no intent of doing). But here's the kicker: even before I got this email, I got email from Jumpspeak *thanking me for my order*.

4. When you go to their [Customer Service Portal](https://jumpspeakapp.samcart.com/customer_hub/dashboard), you can *view* your subscription and you can update your card‚Ä¶you can't cancel it. To cancel you have to search in help, [find the relevant page](https://help.jumpspeak.com/article/5-how-to-cancel), then [go to another page](https://www.jumpspeak.com/billing), enter your email to get a magic link, and only then do you get to the billing site. It's safe to say they seem to be trying very hard to make it difficult to cancel. (This is also how I confirmed that I *am* set up to be billed, so I mashed that cancellation button so hard.) Anyway, for those who care, the current rate is ""$69.00 every 91 days"".

5. My ""100 day"" free trial begins on Jan 25 and ends on Apr 25, which‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ not 100 days?!?

Okay, these are the shenanigans *outside* the app! But since I was already registered (against my will!), I downloaded and started to run the app. This is for Italian.

- As noted above, there is nothing customized about it. It didn't seem to do anything with my quiz results to find the right level for me.

- All I go was a very scripted, pre-set set of lessons. Each lesson has has a Listen, Write, Speak, and Conversation mode, with a few prompts in each. It's no less scripted than Duolingo, but isn't even as diverse. The user interface is nowhere near as polished as that of Duolingo. Also, on the Write problems, early on, it gives you no ""distractors"" (wrong choices); I assume that changes after a while.

- There are some silly bugs in the software, like a place where it said something about ""continue to learn English"".

- On the audio (which I suspect is the part that is hardest to get right and most compute-intensive), the system would accept my answers *suspiciously* quickly. I then started to purposely make mistakes. The big ones it caught, small ones (like adding on extra words at the end) it didn't. Not sure how reliable that is.

I then noticed that there is a separate ""AI chat"" mode. Aha, finally, here we go! So I engaged that. There are some scenarios. I picked Travel Planning.

By default, it shows you a question *and* the desired answer. (You can configure a lot of things, presumably including this.) That doesn't seem too useful, but at the same time the question is too complicated to answer otherwise. So I'm not sure how to use this.

Anyway, I noticed it was‚Ä¶rather scripted here, too. So I started to say slightly incorrect things. It just seemed to get stuck asking the same question over and over. I then started to say nonsenical things. It still seemed sort of stuck on a script. Eventually it did show some signs of ""understanding"". But I think the experience here was worse than I'd have if I were typing into a chatbot directly.

BUT: to give it credit: when I ended the lesson, it gave me a score, and then gave feedback on each thing I'd said. The feedback was **pretty good**. *It is also the same as the feedback I've been able to get directly from chatbots* (unsurprisingly). What it didn't seem to be able to do was give any *contextual* feedback: e.g., ""what you said was grammatically correct, it just has nothing at all to do with *travel planning*, and was actually kinda' nonsensical and had nothing to do with my question!"".

I went back to try it again to see whether it would give me a rather different conversation. But from what I can tell, that exact button is ‚Ä¶ no longer there? This is weird: the whole point of using GenAI is that you can have the same conversation many times, somewhat different each time: e.g., before a trip, it can be useful to practice a dozen *different* food-ordering conversations. Is Jumpspeak removing the buttons after you've tried them once?

So overall, it's a very mixed bag. The signup experience is bad and feels very scammy. (Dear Jumpspeak lawyers: I'm not saying you *are* a scam, you're just‚Ä¶well.) The app is so-so if you take away the ""AI"". The AI part is‚Ä¶mixed so far.

My usual sentiment is to say ""hey, it's a new system, they're trying something interesting, let's see how this evolves"".

"My Review - So much potential, only some of it realized",HarryPotterGame,1i9xcxg,2025-01-25 16:20:02,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/1i9xcxg/my_review_so_much_potential_only_some_of_it/,Warder45,User Reviews,"Having watched the Hogwarts Baking Show and having thrown on some hogwarts Christmas backgrounds from the game over the holidays, we noticed the game on sale and decided to give it a shot. Overall, I'd give it a 3 out 5 stars. Generally the first half of the game is really good, with the back half being pretty mediocre to bad.



**The Good**: The art and design team deserves some major praise. Hogwarts is amazingly detailed, even without ray tracing, the reflections, lighting, textures, are all really well done. The size of the environments as well as your ability to just mount up and fly around outdoors is really technically impressive. Even the forbidden forest, which I assumed would be a no-fly zone, was open to fly to, which was great. But it's not just all technical, moving portraits, or a hall of music playing one, ghosts wandering around, the school feels full of life. There is a plethora of outfit options you can mix and match. I'm not sure there are words to do justice to just how well the art and design team did in this game.

The reason the first 40-50% of the game is good is that it does a better job at capturing not just the vibe of the books/movies, but even outside of the IP, it's what you'd want in a cozy-ish, YA, school style game. You get to go to a fancy school with classes about learning magic, making friends, and solving problems. They've build a ton of puzzles into the game, some that work really well in the beginning, like portraits that show a location and you need to find it. Helps with exploration of the massive space. Having spells that can levitate and move objects makes for some Breath of the Wild like puzzles. While the Astrology puzzles aren't really hard, they are still pretty fun for what they are.

In fact, as someone who enjoys cozy games, they really iterated on a lot of cozy game concepts and refined them. You get your own magic room, to decorate how you like, to brew potions, house animals, grow plants, etc. They've done an excellent job making all your materials matter. In many cozy games, animal husbandry is more for enjoyment than tangible in game effects. For example, you almost always get more crops for less effort than animal products when trying to make money. Here, everything is used, animal products are required to upgrade your gear, which gets improved with each level, so you'll constantly be swapping things out and wanting to upgrade them again. 

Speaking of husbandry, the animals are all very well animated and realized. There are some very cute creatures in this game. And in your vivarium's where they live, you can launch balls for them to play with or use a spell to pet them, which can be very calming since cat animals purr, duckbill like animals will fall on their back while you pet their tummy. When it comes to animal husbandry, this is the game to beat now.





**The Meh**: While collecting decorations and clothes is a great incentive for solving puzzles, it does have the downside of ""you have to hope it randomly gives you X"" when you solve one. If items were tied to specific puzzles and camps, that would allow player who wanted a specific hat, glasses, coat, etc to beeline it to there so they could equip their look early on. 

The day/night cycle isn't great. It never feels like it's day long enough, and you have to open your map, hold F to then ""sleep"" where you are to move time forward. But weirdly it seems to move from day, to early night, to late night, to day again, which is strange since there are things at night and things during the day, not sure why there is 3 parts to the cycle.

Character models are also quite limited. For how much they put into the environments, it's a shame. It seems they have a couple professors that are slightly higher but otherwise, some look just like students (gardening professor) or just had wrinkles applied to be ""older"". It's really strange they didn't build in different body types.

The map could also use work. Not sure why they though holding down a button to rotate then zooming you back out after you let go was a good design choice. The map constantly fights you in Hogwarts, since floo flames are hard to make out where they really are.

And I'll just leave this here, I did a side quest to save a lady's pet Niffler. Reward? A Niffler lined hat...





**The Bad**: Well lets start with quick one, it's still Harry Potter, warts and all. They did a better job than the movies with diversity, but removing the horrible house elf stuff was a bridge too far I guess. They could have used literally anything, a magical ghost or item instead of Deek and him talking about his crappy master (why do they all come from bad wizards?)

Outside of Potter specific stuff, the last 50% is just not great. The main story was always sort of a filler, but there was a lot of build up for not a lot of payoff towards the end. Since it's YA, I'm even going to cut them some slack in how an army of goblins is setup around a school of wizards and literally no adult is doing anything about it. The main drag is that it just doesn't feel like the same school cozy game. There are still a few side quests, but there are no more classes, even Hogwarts feels a bit lesser since professors will just disappear from their classrooms never to be found. Say nothing of the ""good""/""bad"" paths in the game. It feels like the bad path was tacked on at the end to get the illusion, but it's just ""I want money vs not"" for 90% of the choices.

Sadly combat is also just not very satisfying. You are almost always alone, there are too many spells, forcing you to rotate the bar constantly since some spells just don't work well on certain enemies. I never use the block option, since dodge rolling was infinitely easier and more useful. The idea of color coded shields is a good idea to start, but in the context of the entire combat design, it never really came together. Descriptions of how to tackle enemies gets buried in the glossary and even then, it's not very helpful (boy it would be nice to have a class to take where to showed you how to fight certain monsters...) And this is all before talking about balance.

The games balance is really bad. For as great as upgrades and adding traits to clothing is for making husbandry useful, they did a really bad job balancing those traits out and the power curve as you get higher level. I had 1 level 3 trait increasing all plant damage (out of 6 pieces of gear, so I could have had 5x as much) and with just that one, 2 cabbages and 2 vine plants would wipe out every camp in the game. Hell I'd throw 2 sets of cabbages out and they'd pretty much solo a Troll (the hardest non-boss unit in the game). But it's not just plants, with a couple ancient magic ones, I'd constantly be full and could 1 shot anything. 

I'm not 100% sold on how you collect animals as well. If the game was setup so you rescued animals from poachers and that's how you filled your vivarium, that would have been infinitely better than going to their natural habitat, sucking them up into your bag, then bringing them to your own personal zoo. You are literally a poacher in this game, kidnapping animals to create materials you can harvest. It wouldn't be that hard to build our vivarium via poacher camps (giving players another reason to do them) and put some puzzle system in place to protect animal dens, just re-allocate a couple dozen merlin trials ha.

Speaking of merlin trials, for as great as having so many puzzles in the game is, half of them are not really puzzles but busy work. Once you understand what to do with the merlin trials, there is no difficulty at all. It's just going and doing. It seems like they would have been better served cutting those in half and making the remaining ones a bit better. Which leads to another major pain point, the game doesn't do a good job tracking what has been done. Looking for that remaining page in hogsmede? I hope you have a picture perfect memory for the other 50 you already got if you plan on looking up the rest. This goes for all collectables in the game. I think part of the problem is that they re-use page locations later in the game, so having one that you got still flying around marked as such, would cause too much stuff at one time. 



Overall, I really enjoyed the first 40-50% of the game, and wish the they had been able to harness that for the entire game. I couldn't help but play the remaining game re-designing it in my head. If they had designed this more like a Bioware game, with students you could befriend, they would then be companions on quests, it would open up so much more of the game. Now you could design a better combat system, with all sorts of combos. The room of requirement has so much wasted space by the end, if it was the hangout for your friends, maybe there would be a table where you could suggest classes they take, so help with their builds? Maybe there would just be games or things to do? Speaking of classes, clothing being limited to traits and health would help make classes required for increasing spell damage. Maybe you take potions class to improve your purple spells, or transfiguration for yellow, take botany for increased plant damage. But you can't do them all, which would allow for actual builds in the game. I could probably go on for a while here but you get the idea.



I hope the developers are cognizant of the issues if they plan on doing another game. The game engine, art, and design are really top notch, just let those folks cook. But I hope they take another look at the core game design. "

Why You Should Use a Banishing Spell,occultspells,1i9xcfo,2025-01-25 16:19:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/occultspells/comments/1i9xcfo/why_you_should_use_a_banishing_spell/,swingerlover,," 

Banishing spells are among the very critically essential tools that  one needs in their lives. They are so crucial that they can lead to a  complete change in someone‚Äôs life. Simply described, banishing spells  establish a safe environment, a psychically secured bubble around you  that may be guarded by hexagrams, pentagrams, Archangels or other beings  and figures

This spell is still regarded as one of the fundamental practices of  ceremonial magic. This spell is quite helpful for everyone who feels  under some negative attacks feels a lot of negativity around them, or  simply feels some sort of possession. It is ideal for banishing  negativity and cleaning the spiritual space. Banishment spells have been  around since the dawn of time and used often with other spells to  enforce the results, especially love spells.

In several cultures of Paganism, banishing is conducted to eliminate  negative or undesired energy, or in some instances people who can cause  problems in our work or general life. While some cultures view banishing  as a retrogressive practice because of their reasons i.e. like the  saying that it affects the free will of others if your culture has no  bans against such matters, then there is no basis that you can‚Äôt  practice a banishing spell. Remember the main aim of a banishing spell  is to eliminate those trying to interfere with your relationship, work  or the smooth running of your life. It is not about harming other  innocent people who may have nothing negative about your life.

There are distinct approaches that can be applied to achieve  successful banishing. Depending on your preference, you will need to  choose one among the available approaches- depending on how satisfied  you are with the varying methods and what you are trying to attain.

**Dealing with the unknown spirits.**

Knowing your enemies presents the easiest way to handle the problems  they are causing in your life. If you are fortunate, you can face the  person you no longer wish to see in your life and let them know that.  They will leave you alone. Nevertheless, this may seem simple said than  done. In some worst scenarios, you may not be aware of the person  causing the problems you are facing. This is where the Banishing spells  come in. Even though you may not know the source of your problems, you  will still get the assistance you deserve.

**Banishing Ritual**

According to experts of magic and life, the worst enemy that can  impact negatively on your life is bad spirits. These can either be cast  by your rivals or you may be the one who invited them. While handling  the spirits cast by your rivals may be somewhat challenging, there is  arguably no other thing you should do apart from dealing with the bad  spirits that you may have attracted into your life.

By now, it should be clear that the things you draw into your life  are nothing but the things you are preoccupied with. In this regard, I  imply that in case you are preoccupied with anxiety, you will draw the  same anxiety into your life. By equal measure, if you are overwhelmed by  a dislike for someone you are destined to draw hatred to your life as  well. If you trust that everyone you find in your everyday life is  anticipating harm you then that is what will possibly occur.

With that in mind, the ideal defense from evil spirits is to make  sure that you guard yourself with joyful situations and joyful people.  Above all, use the banishing spell. Never allow others space to control  the state of your spirit at any instance; God should only have such  right in your life. Allow the energies of the banishing spell to defend  you. Rise every day with the determination that you are safe with the  spell. You should always keep in your mind that you are the boss of your  fate and your life will run as per the way you desire it to.

If you have any doubt that there may be harmful spirits in your life,  your place of work or your relationship, it is time to act. The  Banishing spell will eliminate them and allow you to live a free life. I  have had many people casting away the most dangerous spirits in their  lives by utilizing these spells. Note that it is preferable to protect  yourself with the banish spells rather than to wait for something to  befall you to act.

However, this school year I have one student who is from a JW family. Because of this, the school and myself have had to make special accommodations on request of the student's family such as making the student not participating in holiday activities such as Halloween or Christmas-themed events at the school or being ""exposed to"" literature/media that goes against their faith like the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings books.

However, this student seems to be completely obsessed with Dragon Ball Z. He wears Dragon Ball Z t-shirts and brings his own Dragon Ball Z mangas from home, so I assume his parents are fine with him being exposed to THAT.

This character would not interact with them at all in the rp, and they'd just see random magic effects in the battlefield, like feeling their health regen or seeing a spiritual weapon or a web etc... so when the hydra died, it woulld all make sense, that was their forgotten buddy...

We've got no Multiclassing and the party is level 11:

PAM GWM Battlemaster Grung  
Half-orc Fey Warlock  
Gloomstalker Harengon  
Dhampir Mercy Monk.

I'm planning to add a caster to the mix to help them out, most likely a twilight cleric (would be too obvious) or a Wizard (very versatile)

A rogue would be hella useful since they're going on a heist arc.... So I could do a Thief 3 Conjurer/Illusionist  8 for them...

I feel that since they aren't promoting a new album, they are sure to dive back into their catalogue.   
I've been going to NIN shows for the past 25 years, and sometimes I feel like certain songs are too predictable or not-so-incredible live.  Does anyone else have a list of songs they feel like they *don't* need to hear on this new tour?

Here are mine:

*  **Hurt**: This is always the encore closing song. I understand why it's here. I brought a friend to a show a few years ago who never saw NIN live, and he did break into tears during it. ""Hurt"" is hauntingly beautiful‚Äî but sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs been played so much that its magic feels a bit... diluted. (I will say, though, that .) But perhaps, just perhaps, we can *peel it back* and maybe have a slightly new rendition for this tour? It‚Äôs like the emotional punch that we‚Äôve all come to expect, and while it hits hard, I‚Äôm ready for something that *surprises me* just as much as it moves me. 
* **Head Like A Hole**: Look, this track is iconic, and when it hits at a live show, you can feel the energy rise. It's awesome in the pit. It‚Äôs hard not to love it, but that said, there are deeper, harder cuts in the NIN discography that deserve this slot!
* **The Perfect Drug**: I think this is the only NIN song I truly do not like in any way. The video filled my 1997 teenage black goth heart up fully, but honestly, as an adult, I find myself craving something with a bit more substance to sink my teeth into. And it's not great live, tbh. 
* **Every Day Is Exactly The Same**: The title says it all, doesn‚Äôt it?
* **Closer**: I can hear the gasps already! Hear me out‚Äîthis one is undeniably what put NIN into the mainstream, it's got an amazing hook, it's sexy, and fun, But in my heart, I know there‚Äôs a wealth of other tracks that could take us to different emotional landscapes. I've heard them sort of reconfigure this song, blend it with other ones, etc. That was fun- kind of like a mashup. But tbh this one feels like its for the party dudes in the audience who bought the album for this track and never listened to anything else. 

At the end of the day, I adore NIN and everything they do. It‚Äôs all about growing and evolving as fans, and sometimes that means admitting which tracks don‚Äôt set our hearts on fire in a live setting. 

**What song could you live without seeing live again?**"

We went out for brunch with friends and she was there. But she behaved herself so it was okay. 

It was all fake smiles and we both knew it. I know she doesn't like me. And I sure as hell haven't forgiven her for how she treated me the past year. How she excluded me from conversations, from social activities, and from seeing my own damn friends. 

I'm not the first one that it happened to either. She excluded several other people, who used to be her friends, in the same way. People who by and large didn't deserve it. They had done nothing wrong. But L got bored of them, so they had to be left out.

Ever since she moved away, things have been better for me. The situation in the office isn't as tense anymore. I can talk to our mutual friends and not feel scared or guilty about it. And they get to see me for who I am. They get to find out that I'm actually an OK person, despite what L's been saying behind my back. 

In better news: I finished writing my manuscript! All that's left is to get feedback from the co-authors, incorporate that, and send it off to a journal! 

Next week I got a housewarming in Rotterdam. I think it's gonna be pretty lit. Honestly I could really use a good party. Letting loose for a bit. Meet new people. Have those magical 3 AM conversations about the deepest shit. Even though I'm really starting to feel my age at this point. Hangovers just hit different now.

Also been thinking about the concept of romance a bit. I haven't dated anyone in almost a year. I feel like I kinda want to start dating again, but honestly I have no idea where to start. I was messing around on bumble for a bit but didn't really get any interesting matches. And idk how to meet new people irl.

I'm kinda scared as well. What if the person I date turns out to be abusive? Or what if they're not abusive but overall still not really good for me? Last time it took me 6 years of my life to figure that out. 

And don't even get me started on sex. Dating as an asexual is pretty hard. I think. I don't have a lot of dating experience from after I realized I was ace. If I do end up meeting someone nice, someone that doesn't tick any of the ""scary"" boxes, what are the odds that they're gonna be ace as well? 

Although honestly, I think ace relationships could be so incredibly nice. To have a partner to just exist together. To sit on the couch and cuddle, to listen to music together, cook food together, go travelling together. To experience all the fun things in life with. If only I could find a person like that.

Handling 5 and 7 in Dozenal,dozenal,1i9x42f,2025-01-25 16:09:04,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dozenal/comments/1i9x42f/handling_5_and_7_in_dozenal/,Iiwha,,"In this post I'll use A and B as digits, as my spreadsheet converts that way, and you still know what's going on. Also, I myself am not a dozenalist, but I thought it'd be nice to share.

I have figured out how to handle 5 and 7 in dozenal with nearly the same ease as those numbers in seximal. This could chip away quite significantly at the case for seximal, leaving little else but long numbers and an inability to handle Bs and 11s.

This method relies on a few things.

* Knowing that A and 12 are just 2 off from 10
* Knowing that 5 and 7 are factors of A and 12
* Understanding magic sequences better than the guys who did the video ""The Best Way to Count""
* Balanced magic sequences

So first things first, to get the magic sequence for a number, you start with 1, then at each step, you multiply 10 and then keep subtracting 10 until you get less than 10. For the balanced version, you keep subtracting until you get to just less than or equal to a half the number.

The magic sequence can be used to test divisibility of a dividend by that number, simply by multiplying each successive, starting from the units then leftward digit by the corresponding term in the sequence to see if the result is also divisible by the target number.

I'll give an example

For 2, the sequence starts 1. Then you simply multiply to get 10, which is equivalent to 0 mod 2, so from then on, we have 0. The sequence is therefore simply 1 (and infinite 0s) To test a random number like 1234, we have 4\*1+3\*0+2\*0+1\*0=4, which is divisible by 2, therefore so is the whole thing. That seemed silly and obvious, so we'll go onto a different kind of case as a next example.

For B, the sequence starts at 1, then we multiply by 10 to get 10, which is 1 more than B. Therefore the sequence is a recurring 1. You therefore simply add the digits. This too is an obvious case.

For A, things get interesting, We know A is 2 less than 10, so the first 2 terms are 1 and 2. There is a shortcut here, in that because 10 is equivalent to 2 mod A, we only need to double, rather than multiply by 10. This means we effectively are effectively doing the magic sequence in binary. Knowing this, we can add more terms, 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2... Clearly once we reach 2 it's recurring. This also gives an easy test for 2 digit numbers, so 26 leads to 2\*4+6=A, so we verified without too much difficulty that 26 is divisible by 10.

Now onto 5, 5 is half of A, meaning that the first term, must be the same because you can fit an extra 5 into 10 and still have 2 leftover. This means the terms are 1, 2, 4, 3, 1...

So how do we do the same for 12, and 7? Well, their second terms are 10, which doesn't seem to help, however, by using balanced modular arithmetic, we can rewrite as -2. From this we can simply do 1, -2, 4, 6, 2, -4, -6, -2... Likewise, 7 would be 1, -2, -3, -1. -2, -3, 1... We can also simplify for 5 and A to get 1, 2, -1, -2, 1 and 1, 2, 4, -2, -4, 2...

With these facts you should be able to quickly tell if any number is divisible by 5 or 7. You can even figure out the radix expansion. Take the sequence for 5; 1, 2, 4, 3. Simply ask how many times does 5 fit into 10 times the amount. the answers are 2, 4, 9, 7.

Hopefully this helps you find more ease in dozenal maths. If there's anything I didn't explain well, please let me know."

He claims that he gave them their power, not Mother Rapapa, and can freely move about time.

However, he doesn't strip them of their powers as a demonstration of the former, and if he had the power of the latter, he'd not waste time fighting the Cures, he'd, again, just stop them from using them. Also, he claims to not know what's going on with Hisui.

And if what I suspect is right about his mother, if he could travel through time risk-free, why didn't he save her?



Ire reminds me of the Wizard Of Oz if he found a couple of genuinely magical items and used them instead of theatrics to keep people from knowing what he was doing. As Mirai said, he looks like someone from the Magicless World. If he was the great and powerful archmage he says he is, would he look or act like he's been doing?"

The Unfair Criticism of Perrie‚Äôs Solo Career Needs to Stop. Healthy Criticism is always OK!,LittleMix,1i9x2d8,2025-01-25 16:06:54,12,0.8,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleMix/comments/1i9x2d8/the_unfair_criticism_of_perries_solo_career_needs/,AltruisticOwlx,Discussion,"

Hey folks, I came across the post below mine‚Äîyet another takedown of Perrie‚Äôs music‚Äîand felt compelled to chime in.

Let‚Äôs set the record straight:

1. Only two of Perrie‚Äôs songs reference exes (FAU & Tears).

2. YGYW explores the challenges of divergent life paths and ultimate commitment.

3. MMAY is a deeply personal letter to her anxiety, reflecting feelings of entrapment.

4. Christmas Magic follows the classic format of longing for loved ones during the holidays.

Meanwhile:

1. Jade has two songs about Simon Cowell and two about wild sex.

2. Leigh‚Äôs entire discography, aside from DSL, is about Andre.

Both the girls putting out this music is OKAY, btw! I'm so down for it. Their solo music is literally about their personal experiences, after all. It would be borderline selfish to ask for something I want to hear, lol. 

However, why is Perrie constantly singled out with:

1. ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt found her sound because the others carried the group‚Äù?

First off, Perrie has writing credits on 40 + Little Mix songs that have been RELEASED. She single-handedly wrote 'Love Me' which leaked. It was phenomenal. The girls have also said that Perrie was responsible for Little Mix's compositions! 

Perrie‚Äôs solo sound draws clear inspiration from 60s and early 2000s music. Just because it doesn‚Äôt resonate with everyone doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs lost. 

Let‚Äôs stop infantilizing her contributions to Little Mix, where she didn‚Äôt just lend powerhouse vocals‚Äîshe played a vital creative role.

2. ‚ÄúWhy does she keep singing about old breakups?‚Äù

Well, here‚Äôs a fact: 99% of the music industry sings about love and heartbreak. 

Perrie endured an extremely public breakup, resulting in relentless trolling from her ex‚Äôs fanbase. Her mental health took a hit, and her struggles were laid bare for the world to see.

Little Mix had breakup anthems, but none directly tied to Perrie‚Äôs experiences. Similarly, Jade and Leigh have solo songs addressing personal challenges‚ÄîSimon Cowell‚Äôs treatment, relationship ups and downs‚Äîand no one questions their choices. Why hold Perrie to a different standard?

To be clear, respectful criticism is valid. But saying Perrie lacked creative talent because she wasn‚Äôt the primary writer in the group? That‚Äôs a stretch. Let‚Äôs not forget her iconic vocals carried 90% of their songs, grabbing the attention of first-time listeners.

What‚Äôs not okay is flooding her TikTok and Twitter with:

1. ‚ÄúGet her the same writing team as Jade.‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúHer music is generic and boring.‚Äù

3. ‚ÄúShe needs a crash course in songwriting.‚Äù

Perrie has already shared that her focus in Little Mix was belting because that‚Äôs what the creative team pushed her toward. Can you imagine being boxed into that for years and now wanting to explore something different‚Äîmusic that simply feels good to sing?

She gave us MMAY, a beautiful ballad, after endless requests. Where was the support? She even performed it live. What did y‚Äôall do? Barely acknowledged it.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to think this unwarranted hate could push her away from music altogether‚Äîsomething she‚Äôs already considered.

All four girls contributed immensely to the group, and they‚Äôre doing so in their solo endeavors. Critique respectfully if you must, but this constant slander? It‚Äôs unnecessary and exhausting.

Let‚Äôs support them without tearing any of them down. 

If you don‚Äôt like Perrie‚Äôs music, it‚Äôs simple: don‚Äôt listen.

Again, to clarify, I too have feedback and comments for Perrie and her team, but I'm not going to subject her to any comment that's going to hold me accountable for my absolute favourite singer quitting music altogether because her mental state is not stable. 

Lastly, Perrie is the Little Mix member being booked for live music festivals, events AND TV shows because the UK knows that this girl can sing DOWN. 

Looking forward to your comments on this and please, let's have a HEALTHY and respectful discussion."

"My party is really cool, except for one thing ...",DnD,1i9x1h7,2025-01-25 16:05:49,1,0.6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1i9x1h7/my_party_is_really_cool_except_for_one_thing/,Puzzleheaded-Book876,Table Disputes,"First of all, I don't really know if y'all play by the *exact* rules, I know I created some stuff, IDK if that's unusual, but I really, really like gimmicks

My party is composed of four people, all of them are really cool, but they don't really realise cursed amulets exist

I really like this example: 

Two of them really like chess, the other 2 really like drawing, so, in a dungeon, a trapdoor opens below the chess people, and they find themselves in a harry potter-ish giant chess board, I take a chessboard out of my backpack, and we play chess, just like harry potter(yes, I just stole it from the movie)

Now, the art people move forward, and are now fighting a wizard, a summoner, perhaps. But all his summons are monsters I draw, and I give them paper, so they can draw their own weapons, it's kind of a realm where ""everything you imagine turns real""

They both win their respective challenges, and win a ""prize"", 2 amulets, which do

1-Chess amulet-makes sword, magical and bow attacks 10% more powerful, but, if it hits the  minimum+2 or +1 (12 and 11, if 10), the attack goes in the other direction

2-Art amulet-keeps you with your weapon for the challenge, but, each attack has a 33% chance of making the enemy get a bonus in some stat, and a color change

After that, every time the chess thing activates, they just say ""Eh, that guy must be really good dodging""

and the art one they just act like everything is normal.

How do I solve this exactly?

Always, before the effect occurs, I mention "" Your amulet shines and ..."", and there's this guy, that follows them EVERYWHERE and just says amulets can be cursed, and wants to check theirs, they just say ""He's trying to rob us"" (I did a loooot of other stuff, didn't help either)

I don't want to say that cursed amulets exist, and everything I try fails, anyone knows how to solve this?"

Threw this one in the blender by popular demand.  The magic of 72B was Tess as the base model but there's nothing quite like it in a smaller package.  I know opinions vary on the improvements Rombos made - it benches a little better but that of course never translates directly to creative writing performance.  Still, if someone knows a good choice to consider I'd certainly give it a try.

Kunou and EVA are maintained, but since there's not a TQ2.5 Magnum I swapped it for ArliAI's RPMax.  I did a test version with Ink 32B but that seems to make the model go really unhinged.  I really like Ink though (and not just because I'm now a member of Allura-org who cooked it up, which OMG tytyty!), so I'm going to see if I can find a mix that includes it.

Model is live on the Horde if you want to give it a try, and it should be up on ArliAI and Featherless in the coming days.  Enjoy!"

The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge,DaughtersOfLilith_666,1i9x05o,2025-01-25 16:04:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaughtersOfLilith_666/comments/1i9x05o/the_mystical_symbolism_of_the_key_unlocking/,MortismaStMacabre,,"The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge





https://preview.redd.it/5cpnrl2jf7fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e2ffba05bcce8d7f9a4b75efd49e6773d783f9

Introduction Throughout history, the key has served as a powerful symbol in mystical traditions, folklore, and spiritual practices. Its dual nature‚Äîas both a tool of access and restriction‚Äîconnects it to profound themes of mystery, transformation, and hidden wisdom. Across cultures, the key is a potent metaphor for unlocking doors to new opportunities, guarding sacred spaces, and bridging the gap between worlds. Keys in History and Mythology

1. Ancient Civilizations:

* In ancient Egypt, the ankh, often interpreted as a ""key of life,"" symbolized eternal life and was believed to unlock the gates of the afterlife (Wilkinson, 2003).
* Greek and Roman mythology depicts gods like Hecate, the goddess of crossroads, and Janus, the god of transitions, holding keys. These deities embodied access to hidden realms, marking the key as a symbol of passage and authority (Ker√©nyi, 1951).

1. Medieval  Symbolism:

* During the Middle Ages, keys were emblems of power and responsibility. Guardians of sacred or protected spaces often carried keys as symbols of their authority (Coveney, 1988).
* In alchemy, keys represented the unlocking of esoteric knowledge, marking the transformative journey from ignorance to enlightenment (Fabricius, 1994).

1. Folklore:

* In European fairy tales, keys often appear as instruments of both curiosity and caution. Stories like Bluebeard use keys to symbolize forbidden knowledge and the consequences of seeking it (Zipes, 2013).

The Key as a Mystical Symbol

1. Access  and Transition:

* Keys embody the concept of transition, representing access to new opportunities, solutions, or spiritual realms. They are often associated with liminality‚Äîthe state of being on the threshold between two worlds  (Turner, 1969).
* They also symbolize closure, enabling individuals to lock away past pain,  negativity, or unwanted influences.

1. Guardianship  and Protection:

* Keys have been used as protective talismans. Hung over doorways, worn as jewelry, or placed under pillows, they were believed to ward off evil spirits or misfortune (Danaher, 1972).
* The act of locking something away with a key symbolized safeguarding treasures, secrets, or sacred knowledge.

1. Hidden Knowledge:

* In mystical traditions, the key represents the seeker‚Äôs journey to uncover truths. Possessing a key often implies mastery over knowledge or access to divine mysteries (Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996).
* In some magical systems, the design or material of the key carries symbolic weight, such as an antique key representing ancestral wisdom or a modern key symbolizing contemporary insight.

Keys in Witchcraft and Rituals

1. Ritual Tool:

* Keys are often used in rituals to open or close energetic pathways. For example, a key may be used to symbolically ""unlock"" a sacred circle or ""seal"" a spell (Cunningham, 2002).
* They are also employed in spells to unlock opportunities, love, or prosperity‚Äîor to close doors on harmful influences.

1. Crossroads and Choice:

* Keys are deeply tied to the symbolism of crossroads, a common theme in witchcraft. At a crossroads, the key becomes a metaphor for decision-making, transformation, and guidance through life‚Äôs transitions  (Guiley, 1999).
* Hecate often depicted holding keys, represents the ability to navigate these pivotal moments and unlock new paths.

1. Symbolic  Uses:

* A  single key can symbolize simplicity and focused intention, while a ring of keys may represent knowledge, authority, or the ability to unlock multiple possibilities.
* Skeleton keys, in particular, are favored in magical practices for their versatility and association with unlocking any door (Grimassi, 2004).

Cultural Symbolism and Practices

1. Hecate‚Äôs Keys (Ancient Greek Tradition):

* Hecate,  the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing her role as a guide through transitions and a guardian of thresholds (Johnston, 1990).
* Devotees of Hecate might include a key in rituals to invoke her guidance, often leaving a key as an offering at a crossroads.

1. Roman  Rituals with Janus:

* Janus, the Roman god of doorways, beginnings, and endings, was associated with keys. In Roman tradition, keys were symbolic tools during New Year‚Äôs rituals, representing the opening of new opportunities and the closing of the past (Beard, 1998).
* Celebrants often used symbolic keys in blessings to invoke prosperity and protection for the year ahead.

1. Keys in Marriage Traditions:

* In some Scandinavian and Eastern European traditions, keys were incorporated into wedding ceremonies. The groom would gift a symbolic key to the bride, representing the opening of a new life together or her role as guardian of the household (Murdoch, 2001).
* In  India, the key to the family‚Äôs safe or treasure chest is traditionally given to the matriarch as a symbol of her authority and responsibility.

1. Shinto Shrine Practices (Japan):

* Keys often appear in Shinto shrines, associated with the deities Inari and their fox messengers. These keys, typically held in the mouths of fox statues, symbolize the unlocking of rice granaries and prosperity (Rosenberger, 1992).

1. Key-Carrying Customs in Europe:

* In medieval Europe, women often carried a key as a sign of their authority over the household and its resources. This practice extended into rituals where keys were buried in new foundations to bless the space and ensure protection (Sennett, 1994).

Keys in Modern Symbolic Practices

1. Keys for Manifestation:

* Modern practitioners often carry a small key charm as a reminder of their personal goals, representing the ability to ""unlock"" potential or manifest dreams (Andrews, 2002).
* Vision boards may include images of keys to symbolize opening doors to success or new opportunities.

1. Key Tattoos and Jewelry:

* Key designs in tattoos and jewelry are popular as symbols of individuality,  secrets, or life transitions. They often serve as reminders of the wearer‚Äôs ability to unlock their destiny or protect their own inner ""treasure.""

ConclusionAcross cultures and traditions, the key has played a vital role in rituals and symbolic practices. Whether used to protect, unlock hidden truths, or signify authority, the key remains a universal emblem of transformation and possibility. Its enduring power lies in its ability to represent both access and protection, making it a deeply personal and mystical tool. References

The Royal Adventuring Company. A foray into fantasy.,RoleplayPartnerSearch,1i9wymz,2025-01-25 16:02:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1i9wymz/the_royal_adventuring_company_a_foray_into_fantasy/,Painlash,M4F,"Hi, I'm Pain and I have an idea for a roleplay where we each take half of an adventuring team. Essentially a DnD group that takes quests and wanders through all the lands in search of adventure. I want to specify that this is a 1 on 1 roleplay and each of us would play multiple characters. I don't have an interest in using rules or dice but more of a conventional roleplay. We're meant to overcome the obstacles set before us and have fun along the way. 

A bit about me and my writing style: I write exclusively third person, past tense and I typically write in three to six paragraphs. I'm able to get at least one reply a day (usually before I go to bed, so you'll have something to wake up to). More on the weekends since I can dedicate much more time to roleplaying on my days off. 

What I'm looking for in a partner: Be literate, willing to play multiple characters, get excited about the roleplay and bring your ideas and passions on board as well. I'm looking for someone that just wants to tell a phenomenal story with me so in that interest you should be able to match my writing style and post length. 

I want to be able to laugh at the hijinks, gush over the romances, and generally have a great time. If you think this sounds like you then feel free to reach out! I roleplay exclusively on discord, in a private server that we'll make to fit the roleplay. I'm also open to multiple roleplays simultaneously as we both come up with new ideas. 

I have a starter written out to act as my writing sample and a basic start for the roleplay. Here it is: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard dad! I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù Ti‚ÄôRel said, kicking a stick in frustration. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just do it like all the other kids?‚Äù



His father, a large orc who stood behind him with his arms crossed. ‚ÄúIt is exactly why you should not do it like the other kids, it is hard.‚Äù His deep, gruff voice said patiently. ‚ÄúIf a thing is harder, then only doing it will make it easier. The other children will learn how to make fire the easy way but not us. We will do this our way. For we are not like the other kids, are we Ti‚ÄôRel?‚Äù



‚ÄúBut I want to be like the other kids. Their dads teach them how to use swords and axes. I don‚Äôt even like magic, daddy.‚Äù Ti‚ÄôRel whined. 



‚ÄúBut magic likes you, little one.‚Äù Tu‚ÄôRa said, never breaking that patient tone. ‚ÄúYou will master magic before it has a chance to master you. Now, again. Hands out, clear your mind and focus on the branch. Channel that anger into it.‚Äù 



Ti‚ÄôRel had sat there for hours with his father, just trying to light a branch on fire. If he had succeeded, then his father would stomp it out and make him start again. That was how it was with everything. His father had pushed him until even the boys and girls learning to fight with swords and axes felt sorry for him. Other orcs would challenge Tu‚ÄôRa often, that he was pushing the boy too far. Tu‚ÄôRa would always stare them down, challenging them to raise their own children how they would‚Ä¶ the easy way. To make their children as soft as they wished for his own son would reach his potential. 



It was not until he lost Tu‚ÄôRa in a raid, several years later that he truly appreciated his father for the first time. He Tu‚ÄôRel had always thought his father cold and uncaring but he had not hesitated to take a blade meant for the boy. He had been fighting several of the human barbarian‚Äôs that they shared the Skatlivi mountains with and holding his own while Tu‚ÄôRel cowered, unsure of how to help or where to jump in. 



He made a vow that day, as the flames licked from his small hands like demonic tongues and struck to ashes, the barbarians that had cut his father down. His tears were dried on his cheeks as flames danced all around him, consuming every human in sight one after another. He burned the entire raiding party as if they were dried leaves along the ground.



It wasn‚Äôt until hours later, that he returned to his father‚Äôs corpse, burning it away to ashes and letting them blow in the wind that those tears truly settled back onto his cheek. He was smaller than the other orcs, still larger than most humans but his muscles were not trained in the tortures of constant battle training as his father‚Äôs had been. 



The chief had deemed him a man that day, a thing none in the tribe ever expected. He had been blooded and suddenly his kills rivaled their greatest warriors. He left his home, though. Unable to bear the memories it held of his father. He never received the tattoo‚Äôs that marked him a great warrior in his people‚Äôs eyes, for he did not care for their eyes. He had been a pariah, an outcast, and he understood now that his father had pushed him so hard because he knew there would be no warriors to cover his flank. He would fight alone, and his strength would have to stand on it‚Äôs own. 



It took him a long while to reach the city of Denerim. A long journey for a person not used to traveling from his home at all. Many times, he was assaulted by bandits, some were simply normal bandits and some were the bastard barbarians that had taken his father. He turned each to ash, proving himself to be no easy prey. 



After several months, and several villages he had been sitting in one of the towns taverns when the tavern owner suggested he go to one of the towns three schools. At first, he thought the school of magic would be a brilliant place to find those like him but they wouldn‚Äôt even entertain him before kicking him from their grounds. He had no interest in the warriors school but finally he landed on the messy, unkempt grounds of the adventurers academy and for the first time since his father had accepted him, he was listened to. The receptionist set him up with an interview to see if he was right for the school. 



A large minotaur led him to one of the small offices where he was interviewed and after a short demonstration of his abilities, he was accepted without having to pay the intake fee. They didn‚Äôt often see orcs this far from the mountains but with his gift of fire, they were excited to have him. 



After spending years in the Adventuring Academy, where he was taught the basics of traveling and surviving in rough terrain as well as how to approach diverse situations he graduated and was able to walk from those hallowed halls and unkempt grounds with a letter of recommendation that should have netted him any contract he wanted.



Weeks of being rejected from adventuring troupe‚Äôs and mercenary companies proved the uselessness of that particular piece of paper. Every group that interviewed him assumed he was a warrior, due to his race and he was nearly always laughed out of the interview when he told them that he was a mage. Orcs didn‚Äôt raise mages, it was well known. 



He began to lose hope until a town crier announced there would be a competition set up by the King. Apparently, he wanted to set up a royal adventuring company that would extend his interests in places where armies were impractical for either political or more mundane reasons. They would act as scouts or investigators when the King had a reason to send them off. It would represent a steady income, and the benefits of acting with royal authority.

LOCKED IN DAY 26 PICKS,nbabetting,1i9wyks,2025-01-25 16:02:13,8,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbabetting/comments/1i9wyks/locked_in_day_26_picks/,Kitchen-Branch2658,,"Huge day of picks today, this is not the complete list yet, I will continue updating this list for every game later.

**Celtics vs mavericks**

Celtics injuries - Derrick white GTD

Mavericks injuries - Naji marshall OUT, Klay thompson GTD

Game quality: Very poor

No recent H2H in 2024-2025 season but these two teams have vsed each other a lot last season with Celtics always winning, with only 1 loss. Most these games involved luca doncic, and yet mavericks still could not secure many victories. Mavericks will be playing home today. The celtics have been playing away for the past 3 games and has not been doing well at all recently. Mavericks have also not been too well recently but did just come off a 6 point win over the thunders who are at the top of the league. Both teams are very inconsistent and it is almost impossible to predict the outcome of this game due to no data and so much inconsistency. I am going to leave a prediction here for data collection purposes and this is not recommended for a bet at all, celtics -6.5.

Straights

* Derrick white over 3.5 rebounds
* Kristap over 18+ points (this one is quite worth)

Legs

* Derrick white 3+ rebounds (pretty worth taking, very good history in past 30 and against mavericks, just unsure of their recent unpredictable nature recently but his rebounds seems to be benefiting from it)

**Nets vs Heats**

Nets injuries - Cam thomas OUT, Cameron Johnson OUT, D‚Äôangelo Russell GTD, Zaire williams GTD, Ben simmons GTD

Heats injuries - Jimmy butler OUT

Game quality: Good

Risks: Heats has had some inconsistency recently due to Jimmy butler drama.

One good recent H2H to use. They played 1 month ago. Heats win by 15 points. The lineup was similar for heats who were missing Jimmy butler and terry roizer. On the nets side, they had Cameron johnson, who is their second best player as Cam thomas is still out. Heats win by 15, and this time heats will have terry roizer, while nets will be missing cam thomas and perhaps more such due to many GTDs. Currently pointing towards Heats win. This game was played at heats home, while today‚Äôs game will be at nets home. Nets will have a 1 day rest advantage. Nets have performed quite bad recently due to their injuries and just being not a good team overall, going 1-9 in their last 10. Heats have also struggled a bit but are 4-6. Heats win by quite a lot when they do win, 21 against spurs recently, 16 against gsw. What I like most about this analysis is the fact that they have won recently against nets by 15 and now cameron johnson is also out, and terry roizer is in. This all points towards a heats win. My pick will be Heat -7.5. A riskier pick would be heat first half -3.5 but I don‚Äôt often bet first half markets so I will leave that here for research and practice but not a recommended pick.

**Magic vs Pistons**

Magic injuries - Jalen suggs GTD, Goga bitadze GTD

Pistons injuries - Jaden Ivy OUT

Game quality: Poor

Risks: So many varying factors due to injuries

2 recent H2H, one in november 2024 and one at the start of 2025. The one in november had magics beating pistons by 11 points. This was when magics had an entirely healthy lineup with Franz, Moritz, Jalen. In the more recent H2H however, Pistons beat magics by 9 points. This was when magics was without Franz and Moritz, but with Goga and Jalen still. At this time the magics were not doing too bad despite being without Franz and Moritz, still being able to win games such as against celtics, raptors, knicks. It was only when jalen and goga was also out, magics hadn‚Äôt won a single one recently in the past 6 games, now losing to celtics by 27 and raptors by 16. An immense drop off in skill level due to these injuries. Despite Paolo returning from injury, he is on a minutes restriction and he still seems like he hasn‚Äôt been able to get back into his previous level yet. Pistons will be playing away this time and they have been doing great playing away, with 10+ point victories over hawks, rockets while being away and win over knicks. Pistons have been one of the hottest teams this year with a 7-3 record in the last 10 games, climbing their way up the ranks by a lot, now in 6th place overall, being around 10th before. Magic however are 2-8 with 6 of it being due to the recent injuries without jalen and goga. Magics have been losing to teams like blazers, raptors. Currently magic injury list has Jalen and Goga as GTD. If these two end up playing, it will be harder to decide as we are unsure of their performance coming back from injury. A significant thing to note is that Franz wagner is now playing, coming back from an injury he will be on a minutes restriction and they lost to blazers the other day despite having franz wagner back in. Now if jalen and goga do not play, at the current odds I would take a pistons + spread, but if they also come back then it is hard to say a winner due to the unexpected performance from people returning form injury. Instead an under points looks good here, under 212.5 points due to the minutes restriction factor and the defensive capability of the magics being the best defence in the league and pistons have a history of struggling to score against them. No player props for this game due to so many different variables of returning injuries etc and low sample size.¬†

Straights

* Total points under 212.5

**Kings vs Knicks**

King injuries - Dearron fox GTD

Knicks injuries - Josh hart GTD

Game quality: Okay

Risks: No H2H data can be used

No good H2H data can be used at all due to a very different lineup from both teams last season. Knicks will be playing home and have a 4 day rest advantage. The only confirmations that can be used here is from recent performance. Kings have been doing very well recently as they are 8-2 in the last 10 with their only losses being 9 point loss to nuggets and 15 point to bucks. Knicks are higher in the standings overall but are 5-5 in their last 5, with a mere 4 point win over nets, 17 point loss to timberwolves, 5 point loss to pistons, 15 point loss to bulls, who are all lower than knicks in standings. It is quite hard to predict a spread here due to no H2H data and knicks being quite inconsistent lately. Thus I will be mainly focusing on player props. My prediction pick here will be kings +6.5 just for research purposes and not to bet.

**Hawks vs Raptors**

Hawks injuries - Jalen johnson OUT, Zaccharie Risacher OUT, Clint Capela GTD, Trae young GTD

Raptors injuries - Immanuel quickley OUT, Ochai OUT

Game quality: Good

Risks: Potential strategy change-up from the hawks which may affect the player props a lot. 

Good recent H2H from a few days ago, the raptors beat the hawks by 3 points playing from away. The prediction I made a few days ago and the analysis for it still remains relevant, the difference maker was RJ barrett as 3 H2H games ago, the presence of RJ allowed raptors to win by 2 points while the H2H 2 games ago was a blowout win by hawks due to no RJ. The raptors will be playing from away again for this rematch. Both have equal rest advantage. Hawks are playing from a revenge position. Raptors have seen the most improvement in the recent 5 games. ‚ÄúRaptors managed to defeat the celtics by13 points while hawks only beat them by 4 points. Raptors lost to knicks by 14 points, while hawks lost by 9. Relative to their current standings in the league, raptors have had good improvement as of late and we could see a much closer game than what the current standings indicate. Raptors in the past 5 games have an offensive rating of 115.8 while their season average is 111.1. Hawks this seas‚Äùn are at 112.2 while they have a rating of 109.8 in their recent 5 games.‚Äù It is hard to say whether raptors will be able to continue this streak from this revenge spot for the hawks. This game doesn‚Äôt deserve a spread bet due to conflicting confirmations, my research prediction however will be hawks -3.5.¬†

My character (Felix) lost his home village to a devastating fire when he was young (13). Watching his home burn he ran into the forest, finding a cave for shelter. He has survived using skills learned from his father, a hunter and self taught blacksmith for the village, proficient with a long bow and skilled at making his own arrowheads and hunting knives. His father was well known for his encredible accuracy at seemingly impossible distances. Felix's father trained him how to make his own bow and arrows to hunt from a young age. Felix has picked up first aid skills for cuts and burns he recieved while learning from his father. In his time alone in the woods with a cave for shelter, he has improved his archery, survival and crafting skills. With magic ancestry from his mother, he eventually discovers he can hear the voices of animals and make the flames of his campfire dance.

Felix is nimble and strong, excelling in athletics, acrobatics and perception
Felix carries a longbow and arrows, a hand crafted supply pouch, canteen, and wooden staff or walking stick

I worked at PTSB. Help me expose PTSBs unethical and illegal practices.,u_Chance_Zucchini5048,1i9wwrf,2025-01-25 16:00:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Chance_Zucchini5048/comments/1i9wwrf/i_worked_at_ptsb_help_me_expose_ptsbs_unethical/,Chance_Zucchini5048,,"I am exposing PTSB, its horrific working conditions and the scams they play on customers. If you‚Äôre up for helping me then you can skip to the end. If you want to know my story, read on‚Ä¶

First of all. As an ex-customer and staff member of PTSB, I can promise you all, that in a few years‚Äô time, we will all be using FinTech banks like Revolut. The age of banks is already dead so, I have no problem whatsoever, exposing and hopefully destroying the reputation of this pointless worthless bank.

I was a customer of PTSB for 18years and sadly, I worked for them for a brief period of time.

Let me tell you my experience and, appeal to both staff and customers, to help me take down this absolute disgrace of a bank.

I was hired as a ''Customer Service Champion'' (stupid name for a banking advisor) in a Dublin branch. I had already worked in a couple of banks in a similar role so this was nothing new to me.

I found out, I was replacing a young girl who was traumatised by a customer. She was a cashier who caught the attention of an extremely sick individual who came to the bank every day to perv on her. He would arrive at the desk with gifts for her like perfume and jewellery. He would wait outside the bank for her and eventually, would take the same bus as her and follow her home.

She complained to the territory manager on a number of occasions, but nothing was done about it. No protections were put in place for her and her safety was completely ignored. Eventually, her parents complained to the manager who, decided it would be best that she be transferred elsewhere, like she was the problem.

That is exactly how management treat their staff that they are responsible for. Like they are disposable objects. Not worthy of any respect or empathy.

The man in question continued to visit the bank. We all ignored him, but it never stopped him following the female staff into offices and stationary cupboards. However, no one else complained because they knew it could affect their careers.

Staff do not receive any training whatsoever. Nothing. There is the usual mandatory training that is regulatory but has no impact on how to carry out your job dealing with customer queries. As regards to using the actual Uniscreens or SMART systems, there is no training. No training on how to use the cash desk. Nothing.

You have to hope that the other members of staff will show you, but it is completely dependent on whether or not they want to which, in my case, they weren‚Äôt.

Although the branch staff may appear to be operating as a team, they are not. Each member of staff has their own assigned job roles, customer cases and is in a hurry to get out for lunch at their allotted time and also, get home at a reasonable hour. They don‚Äôt have the time to aid a new staff member nor, in my case, were they willing. New staff are not given access to most systems and are not qualified to make any sales so, without help from other staff, new members are cannon fodder for angry customers and scape goats when something goes wrong.

By the way, the bank closes at 5 however, staff rarely get out before 7 in most cases. All unpaid overtime.

PTSB, as an institution, could not care less about the customers they are supposed to serve. Let me repeat that for any customer reading this. You are not valued in any shape or form. PTSB and, as a result, PTSB staff do not want you in the branch at all. You are considered a complete and utter nuisance. Staff literally gasp when they see you approach or watch you all queue outside or join the queue for the cash desk.

PTSB staff are only there for one purpose and one purpose only. To sell you insurance. You come to the bank for anything else, no one cares. If you are interested in home and contents insurance, you are listened to. They also push you to sign away your life savings to Irish life. The best scam ever, was closing down customers current accounts and making them sign up for Explore accounts. The script we gave customers was that it is better for your credit rating to have an explore account. Its only ‚Ç¨6 per month and you make 10 cent cash back on purchases. After everyone signed up to the idea, PTSB increased the fee to ‚Ç¨8 and reduced the cash back to 5 cent, capping it at ‚Ç¨5. A simple yet effective scam.

PTSB customers are being played for fools. They offer you loans and mortgages at low rates only to sell them all to Pepper Finance who double any rates you signed up for. That‚Äôs why they bought Ulster Bank. To take its loan book and screw over all its customers. Has that happened to you? If so, you were 100% scammed.

Remember, I am ex staff, so I had all of this information explained to me.

PTSB have removed most of their cash desks and reduced the opening hours of the ones that remain, all to dissuade customers from coming to branch. There are a lot of overheads keeping branches open, especially the extra 25 acquired Ulster banks. They instead have put in place flimsy self-service machines and online banking portals. Let me tell you, these are the most disgustingly vile dirty machines that no one should touch believe me. They are forever breaking down and no one in the branch can fix them. An engineer visit has to be arranged which can take days. Again, to dissuade customers from coming to the branches. Instead, customers are directed to the app. The online banking and app are the most bare basic, useless outdated services that can do nothing but tell you your balance. That‚Äôs it. The other port of call is the telephone banking service which all of you know, is just to keep you on hold for an hour then cut you off.

As a result, customers come to the branch already enraged. They have to take time off work to come to the branch to be told they can‚Äôt withdraw their own money because they didn‚Äôt give enough notice, or they don‚Äôt have the right ID or the timer hasn‚Äôt been set. No, it‚Äôs because PTSB doesn‚Äôt have the cash to hand out. This is actually funny to me because when I was there, the manager stole ‚Ç¨5000 and it was written off??! It‚Äôs a sinking ship of a bank that has lost a lot of its investors already.

Because the branch staff are not trained to handle any queries apart from setting up the app, customers become aggressive towards the staff like everything is their fault. I have witnessed customers screaming in staffs faces, corner them in offices, throw things at them. I‚Äôve personally been grabbed, slapped, hands around my neck.

One female cashier had been with the bank 2 years. She took the main brunt of anger from customers. The mortgage advisor told me its because the customers are racist. Her and another white cashier with 6 months service were up for contract renewal. Guess which one kept their job‚Ä¶ Classic racist PTSB. And also, PTSBs pride month celebration. It‚Äôs a marketing campaign. The managers incentivise staff to go to the parade and fly the PTSB banner for advertisement. They give those staff a day off. If they cared at all about PRIDE, they would go themselves, for free!

I have never seen a customer punished for aggressive behaviour. The managers always excused this behaviour and commended staff for not reacting to it. Managers don‚Äôt care about anyone but themselves. They are couped up in the offices all day, often hung over, dreaming about the next PTSB award ceremony where they can lick up to higher management and pat each other on the back for achieving absolutely nothing. PTSB is nothing more than a club for managers.

I should mention, customers who do come to branch to make a complaint are left waiting for as long as possible (to annoy you) then, after you finally utter that magical incantation ‚ÄúI want to speak to a manger‚Äù the manager arrives, pretends to listen to you, sends you on your merry way then, we all laugh at you in the lunchroom. No customer has ever made a complaint, especially in branch, that was ever recorded or handled or taken seriously.

Staff are hired on a 6-month probation basis which rarely gets renewed. Any staff over the last few years who lasted longer than 6 months are either staff they couldn‚Äôt sack during the covid pandemic or staff they absorbed from Ulster Bank that are on separate contracts. There are staff that are recruited through third party agencies that are forever held on a probationary basis that can be kept indefinitely or sacked at a moment‚Äôs notice. In six months, I saw 2 people sacked, 2 found jobs in different banks, 1 deserted and 3 transferred to another branch. The customers then have to suffer a lack of staff and services but who cares about them. Right PTSB?

I handed in my notice after 3 months. Couldn‚Äôt handle the toxic atmosphere, the aggression from customers and for being part of an organisation that scams the public. My manger convinced me to stay, and he would transfer me to a better department. I trusted him. I kept my mouth shut and head down. I made it to the 6-month mark. I was called into the office for what I believed was to be told I was being made permanent and being transferred somewhere else. Nope. I was sacked. No actual reason given but I was on probation so, all‚Äôs fair.

Turns out a new branch lead joined 2 months previous. Some alcoholic who used to be in airport security. She spent most Mondays in the office with her headphones on pretending to be on a call while nursing a hangover. Well, only on the Mondays that she came to work. Anyway, she told the manager on her first week she didn‚Äôt like me and wanted me sacked. Of course, no one mentioned this to me, so I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to find another job. Just told, your out. Got a handshake and that was that.

O, I was also told that I had to make a goodbye speech to everyone, thanking them for a wonderful experience or, I wouldn‚Äôt get a reference for my next job. Its all part of the plan to protect them from disgruntled ex-employees complaining about them.

I contacted the Financial services union, but they can‚Äôt do anything because legislation has left them powerless.

I filed a discrimination case, but PTSB hire an investigator from a company called Resolve Ireland, who interviews complainants, finds out what evidence they have against the bank then gets rid of it before the case goes to court. Clever really.

Anyway. I hate this bank. I see hundreds of reviews online from staff and customers who hate this bank as much as me. So,

I am gathering evidence from customers who have been mistreated. Any stories you have are totally welcome. Any evidence you have is even better.

I am already demanding from the retail officer, that all maintenance fees are reimbursed for the payment‚Äôs disruptions over Christmas, but I need your back up.

Staff. Please record any interactions you have with your manager. These people are not your friends no matter what they say. Their job is to keep you in line and dispose of you when it suits them. 500 members of staff are planned to be sacked this year. Do you really think your managers are going to choose to leave or, will they sack you instead? The best defence is to record everything your manager tells you. You should not be in the office alone with your manager without representation. Everything you tell them is compiled and kept on record to be used against you in the future. Compile your own evidence!

Also, email them everything that was said in the office and email me a copy. That way they can‚Äôt deny in the future what ever lies and false promises they made you.

This will give you a solid basis to prevent unfair dismissal and I will back you up every step of the way.

I will compile all of this evidence and use it to ensure staff are treated fairly, given safe working conditions, paid for every second they spend in the bank after 5 o clock, are given time off after every traumatic encounter with aggressive customers and hold managers responsible for unfair dismissal and discrimination.

During astrological events like today's, I like to take advantage of the opportunity to perform self-growth rituals. 

My personal development journey began many years ago through traditional therapy, and gradually, as I felt ready, I explored other more alternative types of therapies. Now that I have my own magical-spiritual practice, I use cosmic energies to propel myself forward. 

I do this without involving third parties since, according to my principles, free will is sacred. Also, I usually prepare these rituals well in advance, dedicating time to meditation and reflection to see what serves me best at that moment."

For those looking for friends at UT,UTAustin,1i9wtz9,2025-01-25 15:56:49,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1i9wtz9/for_those_looking_for_friends_at_ut/,sputt151,Discussion,"For those who are having trouble looking for friends at UT, I really sympathize with you! Therefore, I want to offer a possible solution. I see a lot of posts from students mentioning the same few things:

1. They are having trouble finding friends on campus.

2. They've tried the age old advice of ""Join clubs and organizations to meet people."" 

3. They follow said advice, and discover that it was easier said than done.

  
If you've fallen into this cycle, I want to extend an invite to a club that I believe incentives members to become friends with those around you: the UT Magic: the Gathering club. Now, I totally understand this might be considered a ""cringe"" or ""gamer-y"" space to many, BUT, hear me out. At it's core, the Magic: the Gathering club is just a bunch of students coming together, and playing a card game. When you take it at face value, I promise you there is an opportunity to meet new faces and become friends with other students, especially if you're new to the game. 

  
For those who've never heard of or played Magic: the Gathering, that's totally fine. It's accessible to all, and I've met people time and time again that have said something along the lines of ""I didn't think I'd ever want to play a card game, but I've really enjoyed playing Magic: the Gathering."" If you are interested, here is the important information:

  
IMPORTANT INFO FOR THE CLUB:

* At 5 PM, every Monday, the club meets in the Union dining area OR Resurrected Games
* Open to any experience level, and I and others are willing to teach anyone who wants to learn to play
* There is a discord for more information: [https://discord.gg/E2MU6VJufj](https://discord.gg/E2MU6VJufj)

Theory Crafting: Human Blender?,ESObuilds,1i9wsoe,2025-01-25 15:55:14,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESObuilds/comments/1i9wsoe/theory_crafting_human_blender/,AHumbleWeeb,,"Jerensi's Bladestorm + Orpheon the Tactician + dark convergence seems like  recipe that turns any ground AOE into a human blender, right?

+387 weapon spell damage
+1096 max Magicka
+4491 offensive penetration
1. Casting abilities that leave an effect on the ground will create an area that applies a 60% snare and pulls enemies after a 1 second delay, stunning them for 1 second. After 4 seconds, the area deals 821 Magic Damage to all enemies in the 10 meter area, and 1642 Magic Damage to enemies within 3 meters of the center, increasing by 50% for each target. This effect can occur once every 25 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage.
2.  While in combat, casting an ability that leaves an effect on the ground creates a 6 meter Spike Vortex that deals 3855 Physical Damage over 5 seconds to enemies inside it. After 5 seconds, enemies within the Vortex are dealt 1925 Physical Damage over 5 seconds. This effect can occur once every 15 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage
3. While in combat, casting an ability that leaves an effect on the ground summons a tentacle at the target's location. After 2 seconds, the tentacle swings wildly in a 5 meter radius, dealing 229 Physical damage and stunning up to 6 enemies for 3 seconds. Enemies immune to stun take 1429 Physical damage instead. This effect can occur every 8 seconds and the damage scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage

So dark convergence is snaring them, stunning them, and if they cc break they're taking extra damage from tenticles, they're also taking Magic damage from convergence, and physical damage from the vortex, so basically every 25 seconds you turn everyone in a 10 meter AOE into a puree, and scales with damage which all sets give+penetration and because it's split damage it can proc overcharged and sundered."

1) Where is Athena Blackgate? Is she dead or alive? 
2) What happened to Hegemony kids‚Äô mothers? Ursula‚Äôs kids are surrogated but are her grandchildren surrogated as well? 
3) Luna says the dead driver is a non-witch or something? So how did they miss Ruby and Wren? 

Rants: 
I enjoyed the writing but it did get a little annoying when Auden and Ruby‚Äôs POV was reflecting a same tone here and there. I felt that it could have been a little more distinct from the other. 
  
And I felt like Ursula‚Äôs murder and the whole whodunnit thing could have been explained better with emphasis like how they do it in a usual whodunnit book. "

And tell everyone that this franchise exists, and that everyone here needs to watch and play this wonderful series Blue Reflection.

Both Madoka Magica and Blue Reflection Anime and Games are quite similar. And both focus on magical girls navigating emotional struggles, with an emphasis on psychological depth and personal growth.
They explore the consequences of gaining powers, sacrifices, and the bonds between characters.
Magical Girls and Transformations.
All feature girls who transform into magical forms with unique abilities to fight threats Witches in Madoka and Sephira/Reflector battles in Blue Reflection.
Both highlight the importance of emotional connections‚Äîgrief, hope, and friendships are central to their narratives. Blue Reflection Ray and the games focus on reflecting emotions, while Madoka emphasizes the cost of wishes and despair. Mystical and Dark Undertones. Madoka Magica has a darker, more tragic tone compared to Blue Reflection, but all tackle deep and sometimes somber themes.
The Blue Reflection anime/games blend emotional conflict with mystical fantasy. Both series have distinct, aesthetically pleasing art styles, with magical transformations and dream-like battle settings.   "

But I also have a draw to saints like St Patrick and St Martin De Porres and working with my ancestors and past relative's. I know the easy and obvious answer is to syncretize but I have OCD and Autism, so mixing pantheons or paradigms has always been challenging for me, and through personal Gnosis I know the demons have no interest in working alongside angels or saints so there is a sort of ultimatum at play.

Jacob‚Äôs Dream Symbolism *Spoilers for S3E4*,TheWayHomeHallmark,1i9wq6w,2025-01-25 15:52:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1i9wq6w/jacobs_dream_symbolism_spoilers_for_s3e4/,IndependentIcy1220,Theories,"At the beginning of Season 3 Episode 4, Little Boy Jacob and Colton were shown camping out in a tent that was set up in the field next to their house.

Jacob was wearing star and moon pajamas and he was scared that ""something out there would get them.""

Colton then assured Jacob that ""sleeping out here under the stars, is just pure magic"" and that ""nothing can hurt you out here Jakey, I promise.""

They go to sleep and then in the morning, Little Boy Jacob gets up, runs through the field to the house and opens the door.

The dream then switches and Little Boy Jacob becomes Adult Jacob, who is now opening the door to the 1814 Landry's home, and calling for his ""father.""

And instead of his loving father, Jacob finds a man that very well can and did hurt him, Cyrus Goodwin, sitting at the Landry's kitchen table. 

Cyrus then tells Jacob that ""your family is gone, you left them...with me.""

My question now is, was the sequence where Little Boy Jacob and Colton were camping an actual memory that Jacob incorporated into his dream or was the whole thing just fabricated to show that Jacob is still grappling with the man he was in 1814 versus the man he could have been if he had been allowed to grow up in the present?

On to the symbolism of Jacob's dream.

**The White Witch Myth**

Little Boy Jacob was afraid that something ""out there"" would get him, this could apply to many different things like wild animals and such, but in the context of the show, I wonder if Jacob was afraid that a ""White Witch"" or the pond would get him. 

Boy Jacob was well aware of the ""White Witch"" myth, about a woman dressed in white that goes around stealing children, because he was the one that first told Alice about it in Season 1.

And Colton had warned Boy Jacob a few times to stay away from the pond, because it wasn't safe. 

So Boy Jacob's fears were well founded and he had every right to be afraid of the pond, after what it did to him. 

As for the White Witch, that remains to be seen, because we haven't seen how the myth of the White Witch stealing children began yet. 

The only White Witch instance we have is that Kat and Susanna dressed as ""White Witches"" to confuse Cyrus Goodwin so Thomas could move Jacob to safety in Season 2.

We also have Teen Evelyn Goodwin in Season 3, that dresses and looks very similar to Kat's White Witch attire. And that Teen Evelyn believes that the ""White Witch,"" is a helper of people not a malevolent figure. 

And we also have Grandma Fern who was dressed in a white nightgown and singing strange songs probably related to the pond. 

**Stars**

Once again Jacob is shown being associated with stars, as his pajamas were covered in stars and a moon. 

This is symbolic of how in Season 1, Kat and Jacob fell on Jacob's bed and were talking about the glow-in-the-dark stars that adorned Jacob's ceiling and how Jacob told Kat that ""explorer's used the stars to guide them home.""

**Colton's Promise to Jacob**

Colton promised Boy Jacob that ""nothing can hurt you out here Jakey.""

This is symbolic because the pond did hurt Jacob. He was taken from his original Landry family and sent back to 1790 to be raised by another Landry family. 

Then as an adult, he began smuggling which got him into trouble with Cyrus Goodwin, who had him beaten and tortured almost to death. 

And then the pond let Jacob return to 2025, where he is having to grapple with the man he was in 1814 versus the man he could have become if he'd been allowed to stay in the present timeline. 

Also, Colton's line wasn't even true for himself, because he was killed while trying to avoid hitting his own granddaughter on a lonely stretch of road right in front of the Landry's house. 

**Boy Jacob leaving the tent and opening the door where he became Adult Jacob**

Season 3 Episode 4 had some very good cinematography, those scenes at Lingermore, that started with Jacob's Dream sequence. 

It was so symbolic of Little Boy Jacob leaving the tent that he was sharing with his dad Colton, only to run to his house and open the door, where it was revealed to be Adult Jacob opening the door in 1814, who was looking for his ""Father"" Elijah. 

That scene was so well done and really encapsulated Jacob's story arc of having been and still being ""caught between two different worlds.""

"TIFU, Tooling Edition",programminghorror,1i9wq5b,2025-01-25 15:52:05,0,0.2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/1i9wq5b/tifu_tooling_edition/,jazzhandler,,"I‚Äôm not new to programming, but I am new to almost everything about this project. The last time I used PHP was over a decade ago, when it was still more like a scripting language than an object oriented dotnet type of contraption. I‚Äôve never attempted a WordPress plugin, and I‚Äôm using one of those fancy new LLM-driven IDEs, Cursor, which is serving as a super-powered force multiplier to allow me to build something nontrivial in a language I only barely know.

The whole development process has been a multi-dimensional struggle with so many novel factors at play. One of them is that this whole time, F12 has never worked as I‚Äôm accustomed to. Keep in mind that I got my start using BBEdit and NotePad++, so I‚Äôm one who really appreciates all the modern magic a full-featured IDE brings to the table. I used VisualStudio for years, but switched to JetBrains Rider a few years ago, and am acclimated to that. This has been my first time using VS Code, which Cursor is a fork of. So there‚Äôs a whole lot of details that I‚Äôm just ‚ÄúArrgh, I‚Äôll figure this out eventually‚Äù and ‚ÄúArrgh, I‚Äôll get used to this eventually‚Äù, because that‚Äôs what developers do, learn and adapt.

I managed to build a prototype with a couple pieces of core functionality, and then proceeded to build it out as a full featured app (okay, plugin, whatevs). Well with all this new stuff I‚Äôm learning simultaneously it‚Äôs not surprising that even with super-powered force multipliers, it‚Äôs still been a good bit of work to make it all work. And I have been in deployment hell the past couple days, with my Claudes heroically helping to debug and make it all line up somehow.

I kept coming back to the F12 question, figuring maybe VS Code used different shortcuts, or something was set funny on my Mac, etc. Nothing I could find on the Web lined up with that assumption, so I finally asked a Claude about it. He suggested a few things, one of which being that I hadn‚Äôt installed language support. I ruled out all of them, and had installed PHP debugging support, so I knew that wasn‚Äôt it, either.

But I figured, let‚Äôs see what shows up in this world‚Äôs equivalent of NuGet‚Ä¶ hmm, here‚Äôs a PHP extension with 4.6 million installs that I don‚Äôt have installed. Maybe‚Ä¶?

Everything lit up like a Christmas tree. More specifically, a Christmas tree on fire, all red and yellow and just the occasional spot of green visible through the flames. All those esoteric errors that Claude and I had built half a freakin‚Äô platform of support code to trace, work around, and log, one at a time, were suddenly dancing with a marquee tag singing ‚ÄúHello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!‚Äù.

How I got as far as I did without even namespace or use statements, I‚Äôll never know. I guess it‚Äôs a testament to the engineering of modern PHP that any of it ever worked in such a shabby, partial state. But now that I have these super-powered force multipliers *and* language support in my IDE, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about shipping this damn thing eventually.

Thanks for attending my TIFU talk; tip your servers and RTFM."

I had the craziest thing happen when my players were creating their backstories and now I‚Äôm trying to juggle it all.
Player 1 gave me a backstory where he used to run with a party with a Paladin named Frederic. 
Player 2 gave me his character, who, lo and behold, is a fucking Paladin named Frederic. And yes I asked if they were conspiring these characters, but they‚Äôre saying they didn‚Äôt plan anything together. I believe them because they were both very confused when I asked if they were working together.
So working with their backstories, I‚Äôve determined that Player 1 was running around with Player 2‚Äôs brother who has stolen his identity for fame and glory. The problem now is this NPC is described in his backstory as wheelchair bound from an attempt on his life by Player 2. I‚Äôm trying to come up with a believable way to have this NPC steal Player 2s identity while still being true to the backstory he gave me. 
I‚Äôve thought about making him a magic user and use Levitate to walk, but that doesn‚Äôt feel right. I could ask my player if I can tweak his backstory a bit, but I‚Äôd prefer it if I could leave it as is. 
Any suggestions for making a character who canonically can‚Äôt walk give the appearance of being able to? Magic or otherwise?

When sorcerers level up, do they just go to sleep and wake up with an epiphany about how to cast new spells?

pixie hollow inspired neverland fairy race,DMAcademy,1i9wo1y,2025-01-25 15:49:36,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1i9wo1y/pixie_hollow_inspired_neverland_fairy_race/,cool-pink-cat,Need Advice: Other,"been messing around with the idea of a pixie hollow themed homebrew campaign, and am really interested to find ways to incorporate the mechanics of the fairies from the movies into the context of dnd‚Äîmy main concern definitely being pixie dust economy. 

for the purposes of that economy, imagine there is only one pixie dust tree with a daily payout equal to up to half of an individual fairy‚Äôs maximum dust charges (based on my current setup, this would be up to 10 charges, provided how much space the fairy has left in their wings). 

feel free give me any feedback at all and feel free to steal these ideas lol 

Neverland Fairy

Born of a baby‚Äôs first laugh, these tiny, magical creatures possess various ‚Äútalents‚Äù‚Äîmagical abilities they use to steward and tend to nature. 

Neverland Fairies resemble tiny humans, with long, lacey, quadripartite wings on their backs. They are born with a variety of skin tones, body types, and personalities, though most fairies measure from 3-5 inches tall. 

Neverland Fairies will typically ‚Äúdress to their talent‚Äù, often sporting color coded natural elements made into garments; garden talent fairies most often will wear clothing made of pink flower petals and foliage, animal talent fairies might wear shades of orange and brown feathers and leaves, and water talent fairies will don various aquatic plantlife in shades of blue. 

Ability Score Increase. When determining your character‚Äôs ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

Creature Type. You are Humanoid. 

Size. You are small. 

Speed. Neverland Fairies have a walking speed of 5ft. 

Age. Neverland Fairies are born as they are, and do not age. 

Pixie Dust Flight. Neverland Fairies have a flying speed of 45ft, and require a supply of Pixie Dust in order to fly. One charge of Pixie Dust provides 1 minute or 450ft of flight. Neverland Fairies are able to store up to 20 charges of Pixie Dust in their wings, which must be manually replenished. 

Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust. Neverland Fairies may choose to shed charges of their own dust, sprinkling it from their wings and onto an object or creature if their choice, so long as they can reach the target. Each charge applied to the object or creature provides a 30ft flight speed for 1 minute. Using this feature requires an action. 

Water Weight. The wings of Neverland Fairies are very pourus and absorbant‚Äîas such, if their wings get wet, they become too heavy for flight, and must be fully dried before Neverland Fairies can fly again.  Similarly, while underwater, if their wings are exposed and/or wet, the weight will cause the Fairy to sink at a speed of 30ft.

Temperature Sensitivity. Built for very different thermal conditions, ‚Äúwarm talent‚Äù fairies and ‚Äúwinter talent‚Äù fairies have different tolerance for different temperatures, especially with regard to their wings. 

Warm Talent Sensitivity. Exposure to temperatures below freezing for 1 minute will cause warm talent fairies‚Äô wings to freeze and become unusable, which will require a short rest in at least 65 degrees to heal. After an additional 1 minute of exposure to the cold beyond the first, roll a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 18. On a success, roll a d4; an even result will result in a snapped left wing, and an odd result will result in a snapped right wing. On a failure, both wings succumb to the cold and break, for which the only known cure is Twin Harmony.

Winter Talent Sensitivity.  Similarly, winter talent fairies wings will become overheated and unusable after 1 minute of exposure to temperatures above freezing; this can only be cured through a short rest in freezing or below freezing temperature. They must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 18 after an additional minute of exposure. On a success, roll a d4; an even result will result in a dead left wing, and an odd result will result in a dead right wing. On a failure, both wings succumb to the heat and go slack, for which the only known cure is Twin Harmony.

Twin Harmony. Sometimes, when a baby‚Äôs first laugh is rich enough, full enough, it can give way to the birth of a set of twin fairies, who will have identical wings, which will shimmer all colors of the rainbow while the twins are within 2ft of each other. This connection is known to mend broken wings‚Äîwhen the twins raise their wings to have their patterns line up with each other, their energies harmonize, restoring any broken wings. Connecting the two sets of wings requires an action from each participant, and the final harmonization requires a third, final action turn. "
