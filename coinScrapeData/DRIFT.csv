AITA for texting my best friends boyfriend?,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,1i9xc9d,2025-01-25 16:19:16,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1i9xc9d/aita_for_texting_my_best_friends_boyfriend/,Quiet_Falcon_312,,"I have a best friend named Marie who's been dating her boyfriend jake for a little over a year.

We've been drifting apart recently, because she's been hanging out with jake every day all day. I wasn't sure if it was because she wasn't happy with me or something, so I decided to text Jake and ask if she's been talking bad about me or mad at me. Turns out she wasn't, but texting jake to ask made her super mad. I apologized multiple times, and she didn't say anything. Marie has been ignoring me since, and unfriended me on all socials.

PP Rework is killing the spirit of osu,osugame,1i9x6ry,2025-01-25 16:12:30,2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/1i9x6ry/pp_rework_is_killing_the_spirit_of_osu/,PlasticViolinist1706,Discussion,"In my opinion osu! has lost its sense of fair competition and equal pportunity for improvement already after the first pp rework (i know it wasnt first in history but lets say around 2020-2021). While its obvious that players improve at different rates - some progress faster, others slowe - and that some players hit a skill limit while others push it further, the constant pp reworks undermine the very value of what makes the game rewarding. Instead of creating system that reflects consistent and fair recognition of skill, these changes disrupt the games competetive balance and shift the focus toward chasing and constant fixing the meta.  
With every pp rework, the meta changes significantly. Most of the time, these changes really favor DT players. If player is very good at DT, they gain a disproportionate advanted over others who plays streams, tech or other unique map styles. This has created a situation where certain types of maps are highly overvalued (DT) in terms of pp, while others - often much harder - are left underappreciated (really underrated). For example, there are maps that are extremaly techincal, finger controll, reading really challenging, requiring precision and high mastery that only certain players could achieve. Yet, very often these mapps offer only 500-600pp, which doesnt even increase their rank anymore. Meanwhile, short DT maps, often aligned perfectly with current pp meta, can easily give over 1000pp or even much more.  
This imbalance is absolutely unfair and damaghes the experience for players or proplayers who enjoy other aspects of the game beyond DT. Old maps, which still hold significant value to many players, often left in the dust because they offer neglible pp rewards, which before were most popular and remembered of gaining pp the most. Score that take immense effor and showcase incredible skill are undervalued simply because they dont align with the current meta. As a result, many of these scores go unnoticed - not just by the pp system, but by the community as well, because now they used to watch HIGH PP RECORD 6th time this month. A score with low pp wont make it to Youtube or Reddit for person who played it to get noticed and attention of his skills, no matter how impressive it actually is, because its not a high pp DT play from someone like mrekk. This created a warped perception of what makes a play ""valuable"" and discourages players from exploring different types of maps and get PP from it.  
osu! had its peak years ago, during and era where competition felt more dynamic and balanced. Names like rafis, cookiezi, idke, and vaxei were synonymous with the game, and their competition and rivals brought excitement to the community (that is just countless example). Why do you think most of them dont anymore in top, not active, because the game lost its natural sense, not because they dont have time, not because they have its life, they had it then but game just got bored. Today, with mrekk dominating the scene - and absolutely so, given his unmatched skills - theres less diversity in the top rankings. While mrekks dominance is impressive and well deserved, it highlights how stale the competetive scen has become. The frequent pp reworks exacerbate this issue by constantly shifting the meta instead of creating a stable and balanced system that allows players to thrive regardless of thir preferred playstyle.  
The real problem lies in the approach of the pp system and reworks itself. Instead of implementing a consistent, well-thought-out framework and making minor adjustments over time, the system is overhauled repeatedly. Each rework not only devaules old scores but also shifts the definition of what a ""valuable"" play is. Legendary scores like cookiezis 727 pp play on blue zenith, which was once and still is iconic part of osu! history, no longer carry the same weight due to these changes. The frequent reworks strip these achievements of their historival significance and create and environment where players feel like their hard-earned scores are temporary and unappreciated.

If the changes to the pp system are neccessary, they shoudl focus on improving the balance between different map types and rewarding individual skill fairly. A single stable system should be developed with targeted tweaks to address specific issues. This would preserve the value of older scores while ensuring that all players, regardless of their preffered maps, feel rewarded for their efforts. Until such a system is implemented, osu! will continue to lose its competetivity, and the game will drift further away from what made it so special in the first place."

Local Data Storage Crisis,flutterhelp,1i9ws10,2025-01-25 15:54:28,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/flutterhelp/comments/1i9ws10/local_data_storage_crisis/,ThisIsSidam,OPEN,"Hey there, 

I have started development of a new personal project. Was about the implement data storage and got stuck upon hearing what's happening to what I have used before, hive. 
  
So,   
- Hive is kind of gone. It works so its good but nothing since 2 years takes away reliability points. There are like 500+ issues on it right now. May cause problems later on.
- Isar, hive's younger brother, same problem.

I have no idea about the SQL things, hence I had decided on Hive previously. I read that hive is easy to use but thought how hard others can be. Well, I tried Drift and got damn. Not hard I would say, I can get my head around it but quite  a lot of extra steps. Creating tables and all (I have only spent half an hour on it).

- Sembast I hear isn't much scalable. Not like my app is going to become too big, but still. 

The major contenders left for me are ObjectBox and Drift. I haven't yet tried ObjectBox, Drift I tried a bit. Saw that it was updated just 20hrs ago made me happy and try it. 

Am I missing any? 

What should I choose? Since I haven't tried them, I wanted to know what bad and good things they have and what I should use in the end. Do clarify if I have any wrong idea about any. 

In my apps, I create classes and store them locally, like, in case of my previous app, Rem, for reminders, I create Reminder object instances and save them locally. Now a productivity tracker, I would create Activity object instances.

Thank You.

I just got algorithmed on YouTube and saw a video about Alex's changing vocal style and I could hear some newer bits that reminded me of the bits I enjoyed on the Submarine soundtrack. I know if I sit down and try and listen to the albums I don't know  without anything to keep me hooked I'll probably fail, so my ask is what gems sprinkled in there thag will keep me listening.

Tomorrow was his birthday, and I decided to bake him a cake. I know he won't be thrilled, but I can‚Äôt afford a proper gift. What could I possibly give him? He has everything already. But still, he comes to me, kisses me like that, just because he‚Äôs broken up with his girlfriend? Is this really happening?

""I... I don't understand...""

He stepped closer, gently cupping my face, his touch both tender and electrifying. ‚ÄúDrea, you‚Äôve captured my heart, despite everything. Somehow, my heart chose you. You make it race with your spirit, your voice, your smile... everything about you.‚Äù His voice faltered for a second, his eyes deep with sincerity. ‚ÄúI know it was wrong to kiss you while I was still with Harlow. That‚Äôs why I ended things with her. We had a conversation, and we agreed to part ways. She‚Äôs moved on. She‚Äôs even pregnant with someone else‚Äôs baby. It‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs just you now, Drea.‚Äù

His words felt like a whirlwind, making my head spin. He apologized for the impulsive kiss, blaming it on how beautiful I looked in that innocent moment, blowing bubbles.

Tears welled up in my eyes, and before I could stop them, they spilled down my cheeks. He wiped them away with soft kisses, making my heart race even more.

It was too much to process. I needed time.

""I... I need to think, please,"" I whispered, feeling lost in the rush of emotions.

He looked hurt but nodded, turning and quietly leaving the room, giving me space.

Hours passed, the clock creeping closer to midnight. I hadn‚Äôt left the room, and he hadn‚Äôt come back. His words replayed in my head. He said he needed me. He said he loved me. Me? Could he really mean it?

But maybe... maybe he only wanted something physical. Maybe he just said those words to make me fall for him, to get what he wanted. After all, why would someone like him fall for someone like me?

But then he said he broke up with Harlow... for me. He wouldn‚Äôt have done that just for something fleeting, right?

Suddenly, a thought struck me. Harlow. Why don‚Äôt I ask her if it‚Äôs true?

I grabbed my phone and searched for her on Instagram. She was famous enough to have a blue check next to her name, and even though it felt strange, I sent her a message.

‚ÄúHarlow? This is Drea. I just wanted to ask something‚Ä¶‚Äù

I was about to set the phone down, when a notification popped up.

Harlow Sullivan sent you a message.

I opened it quickly, nervous.

‚ÄúHey, Drea. Good to hear from you! I‚Äôd be happy to answer whatever you need.‚Äù

She was so nice‚Ä¶ and I felt awkward asking. ‚ÄúI know this is weird to ask, but... did Sorin break up with you?‚Äù

Her reply came almost immediately: ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt tell you? Yes, we broke up. No hard feelings from me. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs for the best. He‚Äôs completely in love with you. I saw it coming. He couldn‚Äôt stop talking about you. You both deserve to be happy together. Don‚Äôt lose him, Drea. He‚Äôs a great guy.‚Äù

I stared at her message, almost in disbelief. She was genuinely okay with it. She wanted us to be together. People like her exist?

Before I could overthink, I sent a quick reply: ‚ÄúThank you so much for telling me. I appreciate it.‚Äù

She simply responded with a smiling emoji, and that was that.

My gaze drifted to the clock. It was midnight. His birthday.

But where was he? Was he upset because I hadn‚Äôt let him kiss me? He hadn‚Äôt even eaten dinner, as far as I knew.

I decided to check on him. Grabbing the cake I had made earlier, I tiptoed downstairs, looking for him in the study, the gym, and the backyard‚Äînothing. Then I noticed the staircase leading to the terrace. Maybe he was there.

Careful not to drop the cake, I climbed the stairs and found him standing on the balcony, his back to me, his shoulders tense, head bowed.

I felt a pang of guilt. Had I hurt him?

I approached him, unsure of what to say. Finally, I spoke softly. ‚ÄúSorin?‚Äù

He turned quickly, relief washing over his face. ‚ÄúDrea.‚Äù

His eyes fell on the cake in my hands, confusion replacing his relief.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... your birthday,‚Äù I stammered, placing the cake on the ledge. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure what flavor you liked, so... I made vanilla.‚Äù

Before I could finish, he pulled me into a tight embrace, his arms wrapping around me, one hand cradling my head as he rested his chin on top of mine.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an angel,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúAnd you want me to stay away from you? It‚Äôs impossible. I tried, but I failed. All I want is to hold you, to give you everything.‚Äù

In that moment, I felt myself fall in love with him all over again. I smiled against his chest, saying nothing. When I didn‚Äôt respond, he pulled back just enough to look into my eyes.

‚ÄúHappy birthday, Sorin,‚Äù I whispered.

My pain management has switched my medication from Tramadol 100mg to Hydrocodone 10mg twice a day. I‚Äôm new this stronger medication and I have medication anxiety. I take my second dose in the evening (6pm) and when I go to sleep (11pm ish) I noticed my breathing is very slightly more relaxed. I also feel I get a few muscle spams or twitches; I‚Äôll be drifting off to sleep and I‚Äôll be woken up my leg twitching once for example. I brought this up to my doctor he said it‚Äôs nothing to worry about. I know that when an overdose happens your breathing gets very shallow and it can lead to death. I know that my dosage is not anywhere close to overdose. But I was hoping people in this community could just put my mind at ease that when I go to sleep 5-6 hours after my dose I will not suddenly ‚Äúoverdose‚Äù in my sleep and stop breathing so long after taking my medication. Please don‚Äôt laugh at me, I know this sounds silly but like I said I‚Äôm anxious about all medications and just trying to be cautious. Thank you "

In the quiet of my endless nights,
I wait, heart heavy, for a sign, a light.
Messages sent, yet no reply,
I wonder if he even sees, or if time just passes by. You were the light in my silent days,
The only one who understood my maze.
We‚Äôd laugh, we‚Äôd share, till the night was through,
But now I‚Äôm left wondering what I meant to you.

I gave my time, my thoughts, my care,
While you drifted, unaware.
I was never your first choice, your place to confide,
Yet I still clung to the words you left behind.

I was just a message, a name on a screen,
The moments we shared feel like a distant dream.
I wasn‚Äôt the person you‚Äôd reach out to first,
And now I feel like I‚Äôm left with the worst.

Still, I wait, though I know deep inside,
That I‚Äôm not the one you‚Äôd ever rely.
You never felt the way I did,
And now, the silence feels like a lid.

I let go, though my heart resists,
The laughter we shared, the words we missed.
I‚Äôll never be your special one,
But my heart aches for what‚Äôs undone.

The nights we talked, the moments bright,
Will haunt me softly through endless nights.
Though I can‚Äôt reach you anymore,
I‚Äôll carry these echoes forevermore.

You weren‚Äôt mine to keep, I understand,
But I still dream of the messages we planned.
It‚Äôs time to step back, to set myself free,
But I‚Äôll always remember you, even if you don‚Äôt remember me. 

I‚Äôll let you go, but I‚Äôll never forget,
The way you made my heart upset.
For in the silence, I'll forever stay,
A memory fading, slipping away.

I know I‚Äôm not your chosen place,
Not the one you‚Äôd ever chase.
But oh, how I long for just one reply,
To feel something, before I say goodbye"

Trapped in a Life That's Falling Apart,offmychest,1i9w8op,2025-01-25 15:30:42,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i9w8op/trapped_in_a_life_thats_falling_apart/,J3llyB3lly92,,"
I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. I moved to the other side of the world to be with him, leaving behind everything I knew‚Äîmy family, my friends, my support system‚Äîbecause I believed in us. Now, I‚Äôm in a country with no one to turn to, surviving off intermittent workers‚Äô comp payments while dealing with overwhelming health issues and stress that seem to compound by the day.

Our relationship has been falling apart for a long time. The intimacy has been gone for ages, replaced by lies, gaslighting, and broken promises. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîcommunicating, compromising, giving chance after chance‚Äîbut he‚Äôs become so detached, so indifferent to me as a person, that it feels like I don‚Äôt matter anymore. His gaming addiction has taken over, and I feel like I‚Äôve disappeared completely from his world. I have been fighting desperately, but I'm not just fighting alone, I'm fighting against him. I don't have the resources for it anymore. I'm sinking and I have to make a choice - I cant afford to not chose me. 

I feel utterly trapped. I don‚Äôt have the money to leave, and he can‚Äôt afford for me to leave him with all the debt we‚Äôve accumulated if I move back to my home country. Even so I have nowhere to go - I am no contact with family, and drifted away from friends. And even if I do - I'm leaving disabled and I don't know how to begin rebuilding with nothing. ‚Äôve lost everything I once had‚Äîmy career, my home, my future, and my sense of self. I can‚Äôt see a way out.

Before we got together, I went through IVF with donor sperm because I wanted to start a family after years of infertility. I fought so hard to make that dream happen, but it failed. Later, I made the heartbreaking decision to discard the embryos because, if I ever had a child, he wanted it to be his. Now, I‚Äôll likely never have children‚ÄîI can‚Äôt afford IVF again, and my eggs aren‚Äôt viable for much longer.

My injury at work was another devastating blow. I hurt my dominant hand and wrist and have since been diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a condition that causes constant pain, swelling, and loss of function. It‚Äôs made even the simplest tasks excruciating, and fighting workers‚Äô comp for recognition and support has drained what little energy I had left. The stress from all of this has wrecked my health‚ÄîI‚Äôve been losing hair, far too much weight, my blood pressure and heart rate is up, my mental health is deteriorating, and my body feels like it‚Äôs falling apart under the weight of it all. I'm in therapy, I'm trying to make the right choices and awareness of my thinking etc, all skills I've had to instill in myself over the years. But I'm falling apart physically, and grappling to keep my head above water mentally.

What makes this even harder is how much I fought to get to this point in my life. I‚Äôve overcome so much‚Äîchildhood trauma and abuse, abusive relationships, losing my best friend and housemate to suicide (we had been planning to start IVF together before he passed), an ex cutting me off from the kids I raised because I wouldn‚Äôt get back together with him, a painful divorce, and my brother‚Äôs death. My mental health was atrocious, I never knew anything but survival mode, until I really started fighting to heal 5 years ago. There were times when I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd survive, but I fought tooth and nail to recover. For the last four years, I‚Äôve been stable and rebuilding my life. For the first time, I thought I was finally getting that peace and reward for holding on. For the first time ever I felt secure.

Now, it feels like everything is being ripped away from me again. My marriage, my health, my future, my dream of children‚Äîit‚Äôs all crumbling, and I feel powerless to stop it. I‚Äôm heartbroken, exhausted, and completely lost.

It makes me question our entire relationship - how unwilling he is to work with me or compromise, or just show me that he cares about me. The years of feeling undesired, making me wonder why he was ever with me. His words often say one thing while all his actions say another. He lies so easily, for the most unnecessary stuff to the biggest stuff. He's been completely okay watching me fall apart and I can't help but wonder if it was all an act. I was okay before I came here. I found peace in my own company & I was okay with the life I was living - to travel, to have a kid alone. And I'm so bitter. I gave everything into this life, and I'm left with nothing. 

I've been telling him for so long that we can't keep going as we are, that we are dying and there will reach a point we can't come back. That I can't keep fighting alone, I'm running out of resources. And it just gets worse. And I could feel myself returning to a place I never thought I would return to. My sign I have to detatch. I vowed I had to fight back in the day, because I wouldn't make it out of that headspace if I ever returned - so I make sure to always do what I need to stop myself slipping. So here we are - I've just bought furniture to turn our lounge into my room, and I think its probably a weight off for him. He's been sobataging for so long, he can rest easy. I just cant believe this is my life. I love him, because he's not a bad person, but I fell in love with someone else. Someone who made me feel loved, secure, prioritized and safe. I'm grieving the person I thought I had, and the future I've lost. And the fact I wasted so much energy and time begging the wrong person for the most basic stuff - to feel desired, to have SOME quality time, to not get lied to, not get gaslit, to follow through on your promises. To treat me the way I treat you. It's so damn embarrassing. I'm battling resentment he wasn't able to give me what he once could before he got comfortable, and just sad acceptance that we just aren't compatible. It's so hard to grieve when I feel like life won't let me catch my breath. "

It's so hard to grieve when I feel like life won't let me catch my breath. "

Me and jake were cool for a while, until I noticed he would ignore her if they randomly bumped into each other in public. Even if Marie tapped his shoulder and said hi, Jake would walk away and ignore her. I didn't like this, but I kept quiet for her sake. We've been drifting apart recently, because she's been hanging out with jake every day all day. I wasn't sure if it was because she wasn't happy with me or something, so I decided to text Jake and ask if she's been mad at me. Turns out she wasn't, but texting jake to ask made her super mad. I apologized multiple times, and she didn't say anything. Marie has been ignoring me since, and unfriended me on all socials. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay, but AITA for texting Jake to ask?"

There have been no punishments handed out yet as I want to be generous and have the first infraction be a warning, especially for those who are new to the subreddit who have found a space to vent about strags. However I now have to make this clear:

# Repeat violations of Rule 4 will lead to a 3-day ban from the subreddit.

If y'all keep doing this then I will have to change the 1st offense punishment to a 3-day ban OUTRIGHT.

# What is ""brigading?""

From this admin comment (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/cmp9uy/comment/ew4lpf0):

> Brigading is an often used term that can mean an awful lot of things, and often folks get quite confused because many folks end up with a different idea of what it means and can look like.
>
> In general ‚Äúbrigading‚Äù is organized attempts at interference in another community. That can take many forms - nasty comments, voting, flooding posts/comments/reports, or many other creative things. Often a brigade can take the form of behavior that breaks other site rules like harassment, inciting violence, or vote cheating.
> 
> If you see users in your community attempting to form a mob to go mess with people that‚Äôs not good and you should have rules in place to help mitigate that behavior. Making sure folks clearly understand that they should not use a community as their personal army to go poke sticks at someone is very helpful.

Basically, let's say someone posted a screenshot of a post from ""ProblematicCharacterMainsHSR"" and everything about it gives you the ick. You, or someone else could go to that subreddit, and start mass downvoting posts there and argue with the people in there.

Likewise, telling people to go mass downvote/argue with the people in ""ProblematicCharacterMainsHSR"" is outright brigading. **Don't do either of that.**

---

# What constitutes as a ""Vent Post?""

For the purposes of discussion, issues WITHIN the game such as M/F ratio, Imaginary/Quantum gender imbalance, audience pandering and the like are exempted from this rule and can be talked about in your text posts. They are still allowed to be discussed upon in the Vent Megathread if you so wish.

That said, if your post is a screenshot of one or more things listed here, post it to the megathread instead:

- Being too horny for female characters. *(Yes, yes, I know, we're horny for the guys, but I think we know the difference between us and the strags.)*
- Shipping CaeFly, but disregarding StelleFly as an equal romantic relationship
- Weird comments about child(-like) characters such as Tribbie, Misha, Huohuo, Clara, Nekomata, Soukaku, Nahida, Sigewinne, and the like
- Using ""yurit\*\*d"" and similar offensive terms
- General strag behavior

---

# Are there any examples of other subreddits imposing anti-brigading rules?

r/Gamingcirclejerk allows vent screenshots of problematic subreddits, but with ONE rule: **Censor all subreddit & usernames in screenshots, or you will be banned.**

# Afterword

Seeing as the growth of this subreddit are from refugees from the straggot lands, I understand that you want to air your frustrations too, but we don't want any more *Firefly situations*. If you catch my drift."
"I rewrite this scene in episode 5 of season 2, and gives Bonnie a better conclusion",TheWalkingDeadGame,1i9w41r,2025-01-25 15:24:49,15,1.0,3,https://i.redd.it/ffjicvdp87fe1.jpeg,Call_me_Dan-,Season 2 Spoiler,"""Clem,"" a voice calls out, hushed and urgent. ""Clem, wake up,""

Oh no. Did something happen? Are the walkers catching up to us? Overcome by fear at all those endless scenarios, Clem shakes herself awake to the fullest. Her instinct immediately tells her to reach for the gun in her pocket, but a hand is firmly placed on her arm, stopping her. It is still dark outside, but Clem can make out the shapes of the person in front of her. ""Bonnie?"" Clem utters out, surprised. ""What ‚Äî ?"" 

""Later,"" the woman shuts. She takes a glance around, anxiously. ""C'mon, follow me,"" She doesn't even give her a chance to think first. Bonnie straight up grabs her hand, and leads her out of the room.

Clem isn't liking this. Why is Bonnie being so discreet and quiet, as if she's afraid of getting caught? Clem wants to wrench away from her grip, but the sleepiness that weighs at the back of her head prevents her from doing so. Therefore, Clem just lets herself get dragged out into the cold of the night.

She doesn't expect Arvo.

That man is free, his hands untied. In fact, his hands are currently busy trying to start the truck Kenny worked very hard on fixing. Did Kenny have a change of heart out of the blue, because to see this happen are as likely as to see Luke walking again alive and warm.

Clem stops in her tracks, her hand slipping away from Bonnie's. ""Bonnie, what's going on?"" The woman gives her an apologetic look; Arvo spares her a side eye. Please, say something. They must have a reason for this. Suddenly, Clem feels her heart skip a beat as Mike's voice drifts in.

""I got everything else,"" the man appears carrying three duffel bags in one hand. No doubt all their precious supplies are in there. Mike is not relatively surprised to see her. When he gives her an awkward nod of acknowledgement, Clem sees he is holding something in his other arm as well, which turns out to be . . . AJ? The baby is fast asleep in his arm. Clem wishes she is too; then, she can think all of this is part of her dream.

""Clem,"" Bonnie asserts herself, kneeling down to the girl's level. ""Clem, listen to me. We're leaving. Mike and I had talked with Arvo, and he agrees to bring you and AJ along with us. Now keep it down, alright? Nobody else has to get involved,""

""Leave?"" The word comes out so harsh it even takes her by surprise. ""What ‚Äî What about Kenny? What about Jane?""

(if Clem decides not to rob him)
Arvo's still on bad terms with Jane, considering she did suggest robbing him in the first place,"" Bonnie hesitates at her next words, ""and Kenny . . . "" 

(if Clem decides to rob him)
""Arvo's still on bad terms with Jane, considering she did rob him,"" Bonnie hesitates at her next words, ""and Kenny . . . "" 

Mike doesn't have the patience for this though. ""Look, we just gotta get away from that guy, Clem. Ok?"" 

""Who, Kenny?""

That got Mike worked up. ""Clem, damn it, just . . . we don't have time for this,""

(if you chose to cover for Luke)
""Just . . . just be quiet, Clem, please, and come with us,"" Bonnie pleads. ""I'm sorry for what I said earlier. You're not just some pretty little girl. I was just angry at everyone and myself about what happened to Luke. It's not your fault,""

(if you choose to save Luke yourself)
""Just . . . just be quiet, Clem, please, and come with us,"" Bonnie pleads. ""It's ok to let go, Clem. Kenny's gonna get you killed, and I can't sit by with that,""

At that moment, AJ starts to make a fuss in Mike's embrace. Mike is in panic. Clearly, he doesn't know how to take care of babies. ""Here,"" Clem gently offers, and Mike carefully hands over AJ to her. Instantly, the fuss dies down, and a crisis is averted. Clem breathes a sigh of relief, then of frustration. What should she do?

Quietly, she asks, ""Where would we go?""

""Anywhere but here,"" Bonnie affirms.

The truck creates a sudden noise, and everybody including Bonnie turns around alarmed, and that's when Clem's instinct kicks in. A moment later, everybody is frozen. To be honest, it is quite funny to see their shocked faces to have a gun pointed at them. ""I'm not leaving them behind,"" Clem insists, finger on the trigger but she is not that eager to pull. Arvo's gun was out too, already pointed at her.

""Easy. Easy now,"" Mike dissuades gently. He's about to do something, she just knows it, so Clem tells him to step back. A frown casts over his face. ""Shit,""

Meanwhile, Bonnie tries her absolute best to convince her putting the gun down. ""Clem, don't do anything stupid now,""

A. Calls for help
B. Considers going
C. Tries to convince them
D. Say nothing

(if you choose to call for help) 
Though, what Clem does next is pretty stupid, more or less. ""Kenny, Jane, help! They're robbing us,""

And there is a bang.

(if you consider going)
""I want to go,"" Clem admits.

""And you still can,"" says Bonnie. ""All you just need to do is to give me the gun,"" And she did. When the gun is off her palm, her hand feels oddly light. 

And there is a bang.

(if you try to convice them against their plan)
""We could still work things out between us,"" Clem insists.

Bonnie only frowns. ""Wish I could say the same thing, kid. Now hand me over the gun, please,""

Clem hesitates for far too long, and that seems enough to be for Arvo. Before she knows it, there is a bang.

(if you say nothing)
""Clem, I beg you,"" Bonnie says sadly.

Clem hesitates for far too long, and that seems enough to be for Arvo. Before she knows it, there is a bang.

It all happens in an instant. One moment she is standing upright, the other on the ground. She can't even feel the pain for the first few seconds. Well, after that, it is hell. AJ is still in her arms crying. The bullet didn't hit him which is a relief, but her blood that paints his face is a horrifying sight.

Muffled voices are everywhere.

""Oh, my God! Clem. Clem!""

""Bonnie, we have to go!"" 

""Don't you touch me! I'm . . . I'm so sorry, I . . . I didn't mean for this to happen!""

There are yells and shouts she can't make out sounding above her. Kenny and Jane. At first, Clem is overjoyed to hear them but then something pulls on her. A shadow. It grabs onto AJ and tries to take him away. Everything is beginning to turn black and slowly fading, but Clem still got to hold on. They can't have AJ.

They must have given up, because the shadow is gone a moment later. With that, Clem allows herself to succumb to a deep sleep."

My co-op games are mainly on my Nintendo Switch. I play Fall Guys on my Asus A15 gaming laptop because Fall Guys has some stability issues on consoles but not on P.C.

I wanted to state that all I have is Telegram or BlueSky to chat on. Sorry if this is an issue, but I don't want to use WhatsApp because I don't trust people enough with my real-life phone number. I also don't use social media because there has been a time in my life when social media has declined my mental health to a very bad degree, and my spiritual energy was eaten. So, please understand that I'm not trying to be difficult.

Yes, I'm all for this anti-social media movement and protest to delete all social media; people should stand against propaganda. I'm glad I'm not on social media anymore after hearing how bad the propaganda became; it became extremely bad. I heard it's very bad out there right now. My mental and spiritual health matters; I will not invite this type of rampant spam of propaganda into my circle whatsoever. If you want to judge me because I use Telegram and BlueSky, that's really terrible of you.

Thanks for reading from Sky or Skies. Yes, it's a nickname that I've chosen myself because I love the element Air."
SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday,SHIBArmy,1i9vw74,2025-01-25 15:15:11,4,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/jnd1kpnz67fe1.jpeg,NihilistHUGZ,Technical Analisys üñç‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These are all the signs of a market at a crossroads. The best way to think of everything currently is going back to my ‚ÄòGroup A and Group B‚Äô analogy where you have Neutral ground across multiple time frames with multiple Indicator classes aligning to show a Weak Bullish outlook overall. The way to look at these two pressures today is in a Short term group A versus a Long term group B. Our Short term Bullish signals are showing Buyers spiking OBV Short Volume and STC signaling the beginning of an Uptrend cycle. When we combine some of our positive CMF and CO values, we can see that this Short term group is accumulating, helping to hold the price in a positive Consolidation.

The pressure of the Long term Bearish investors, appears in the OBV Long term values combined with the price being BELOW the 200-Day EMA shows that it's enough pressure to keep the market from ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. The negative PPO and PVT values signal the underlying Sell pressure. All of this Neutral ground is highlighting the overall Consolidation with RSI and CMO highlighting Momentum indecision. The price is within our Ichimoku Cloud and Bollinger Bands, which is one of the characteristics of Consolidation. The good thing is with our LOW Volatility Indicators, we can expect that any price movements will be quite stable without a clear catalyst. Unfortunately, that drifting sideways tends to stretch the patience of investors and can lead to increases in FUD/FOMO.

We are positioned similarly to yesterday and again, it's only going to go the way of the Bulls or the Bears. If we can find ourselves breaking ABOVE the Supertrend with increased Buy Volume, we will begin to test our ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. My expectation is that for whatever reason, the $0.00002000 level is crucial for SHIB and we will stay right around that price for the foreseeable future until something changes in the market which catalyzes the Long term Sellers to slow their pace or for Short term Buyers to increase theirs.

Looking into our Long term Support and Resistances shows we rest right around the Neutral major pivot point at that expected price mentioned earlier of $0.00002000. The market has the potential to break ABOVE either the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô or BELOW the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at any time. If we see the price begin rising rapidly, then we're going to probably at MAX reach up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00002160. If we begin to see Sell Volume outpace Buy Volume and a sharper Downtrend with increasing Volatility sets in, we could see the price push as LOW as the bottom of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average and should stall out around the 3rd level Support pivot point in a range from about $0.00001900 to as LOW as $0.00001850.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

Day 2 of NoFap: Embracing Change and Reclaiming My Life,NoFap,1i9vw23,2025-01-25 15:15:02,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1i9vw23/day_2_of_nofap_embracing_change_and_reclaiming_my/,Icy-Spring-999,,"

Starting a journey toward self-improvement is always challenging, but few paths feel as transformative‚Äîand as daunting‚Äîas taking on the NoFap challenge. Today marks my second day of this journey, and while it‚Äôs still early, I already sense the significance of the changes that lie ahead.

Why I Chose to Start NoFap

The decision to start NoFap wasn‚Äôt sudden. It came from a growing realization that I was stuck in a cycle of dependency. What started as an occasional habit slowly turned into something that consumed more of my time, energy, and focus than I ever intended. It wasn‚Äôt just about the habit itself‚Äîit was about how it made me feel afterward: drained, unmotivated, and disconnected from the real world.

I knew I had to break free. I want to reclaim my time, energy, and focus. I want to feel more in control of my emotions and impulses. Most importantly, I want to live a life of purpose, free from the guilt and lethargy that this habit brought into my life.

What Day 2 Feels Like

Honestly, day two is a mixed bag. On one hand, I feel a certain clarity in my thoughts‚Äîa sense of determination that wasn‚Äôt there before. On the other hand, the cravings are real. My brain constantly tries to rationalize going back: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just once; it won‚Äôt matter,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already gone two days; you deserve a reward.‚Äù

But deep down, I know these are just excuses. They‚Äôre the same thoughts that have kept me in this loop for years. Recognizing them for what they are‚Äîtemporary impulses‚Äîhas been key to staying strong so far.

The Struggles of Starting

Let‚Äôs be honest: starting NoFap is not easy. The first few days are often the hardest because they force you to confront the patterns you‚Äôve built over time. For me, the hardest part has been breaking the autopilot mode‚Äîthose moments when my mind automatically drifts toward the habit without me even realizing it.

Distractions are everywhere, especially in the digital age. Social media, advertisements, even casual scrolling online can sometimes feel like traps designed to test my resolve. Staying mindful and avoiding these triggers has been a challenge, but I‚Äôm learning to navigate it step by step.

What I‚Äôm Learning About Myself

Even though it‚Äôs only been two days, this journey is already teaching me a lot about myself. For one, I‚Äôve realized how much of my energy I‚Äôve wasted on things that don‚Äôt add value to my life. I‚Äôve also become more aware of the emotions that drive my actions‚Äîstress, boredom, loneliness‚Äîand how I‚Äôve used certain habits to cope with them.

NoFap is forcing me to confront these emotions head-on, rather than running away from them. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, but I know it‚Äôs necessary for growth.

How I‚Äôm Staying Motivated

Staying motivated on Day 2 is about focusing on the bigger picture. I remind myself constantly why I started this journey. For me, it‚Äôs about more than just breaking a habit‚Äîit‚Äôs about becoming the best version of myself.

I‚Äôve also started creating small, achievable goals to keep myself on track. For example, instead of thinking about how hard it will be to go a whole month, I focus on making it through today. I tell myself, ‚ÄúJust one more day. You can do this.‚Äù

I‚Äôve also found it helpful to read stories of others who have successfully completed the NoFap journey. Seeing their transformations‚Äîhow they‚Äôve regained energy, confidence, and control‚Äîgives me hope that I can do the same.

Building Healthy Habits to Replace the Old Ones

One of the biggest lessons I‚Äôve learned so far is the importance of replacing bad habits with good ones. Simply avoiding something isn‚Äôt enough; you need to fill that void with positive, constructive activities.

For me, this has meant spending more time working out, reading, and focusing on my personal growth. Exercise, in particular, has been a game-changer. It helps me channel my energy into something productive, and it leaves me feeling accomplished and refreshed.

I‚Äôve also started journaling, which has been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions. Writing about this journey‚Äîlike I‚Äôm doing now‚Äîhelps me stay accountable and reflect on my progress.

Looking Ahead

Day 2 might not seem like much, but for me, it‚Äôs a huge milestone. It represents a commitment to change, a step toward breaking free from a cycle that‚Äôs held me back for too long. I know the road ahead won‚Äôt be easy. There will be days when the cravings feel overwhelming, when progress seems slow, and when giving up feels like the easiest option.

But I also know that every day I resist, I‚Äôm building strength. I‚Äôm proving to myself that I‚Äôm capable of change.

This journey isn‚Äôt just about quitting a habit; it‚Äôs about reclaiming my life. It‚Äôs about taking back control, one day at a time. And if Day 2 is any indication, I‚Äôm ready for the challenges and victories that lie ahead.

Here‚Äôs to staying strong, growing every day, and embracing the person I‚Äôm becoming.

It's lasted a good while, and I usually repair joystick drift myself. Since this controller is well out of warranty, I decided to replace the joystick. I ordered some new joysticks, and they arrived, but now I‚Äôve run into a new problem.

The solder just won‚Äôt budge. I tried mixing in some solder wire I had, and that helped a little, but it solidifies almost immediately when I move the tip away. This makes it impossible to use my pump to remove the excess solder. Because of this, I can't loosen the solder enough to get the joystick out, so I‚Äôm stuck.

Does anyone have tips or suggestions on what I can do? I feel like Sony made this way harder than it needs to be.

And for context i have a YIHUA 862BD+ soldering station so i believe it's supposed to be good enough for about everything i ever want to fix myself.

Insomnia While tested for Narcolepsy,Narcolepsy,1i9vqhy,2025-01-25 15:08:15,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1i9vqhy/insomnia_while_tested_for_narcolepsy/,BraveBed4430,Undiagnosed,"Hi, I know this is long & I‚Äôm sorry if any of this sounds dramatic. I recently 10/24 had a really rough go with insomnia- things I tried did not work(basic sleep hygiene, zzzquil, Xanax, seroquel, ambien. ) I would fall asleep and then wake up two hours later. Finally I saw a neurologist who understood what I was talking about- he wrote me amitriptyline and at a low dose I was able to fall asleep again. Although lately it has been feeling like it is taking longer to work & I don‚Äôt feel super rested compared to no sleep it‚Äôs a huge blessing. I also spoke to him about potentially having narcolepsy, as I‚Äôve had fatigue, sleep paralysis over 100 times, and cataplexy (which I didn‚Äôt know was a thing for a long time- I thought everybody had funny hands) the cataplexy was mainly as a young child/very rare teenage & seldom as much in adulthood. 

Due to insurance issues, I was never able to meet the sleep neuro yet- however luckily I scored getting into a sleep study- which was yesterday.

Well, off the bat it started out rough. Arrived at 7:45/8pm- When I mentioned I brought my sleep apnea machine the tech said no your doctor did not write this, you cannot use this, & the first test is for sleep apnea if you have it bad you will fail for the second part. This was very frusturating as I already know I have sleep apnea, & the whole reason I went was to be tested for narcolepsy as that is what I believed was causing insomnia. When I mentioned I was having insomnia recently he had said you would not have insomnia with narcolepsy. 

Anyways I go to try to sleep, and it‚Äôs not going well. I recently found out I have PCOS & sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs pressing on my bladder & I have to pee. I didn‚Äôt want to bother the tech so I would try to reposition myself but I ended up having him undo the wires like legit 8 times so I could use the restroom. I was hella stressed thinking about how if I don‚Äôt get 6 hours I won‚Äôt be able to do the second test & also being hooked up to wires in a hospital room was stressful as my ex died a little over a year ago & spent two weeks in a hospital hooked up to similar wires so I was overthinking everything.

Around 5am I said I should just go home, We already know I didn‚Äôt make the 6 hour requirement for sleep to do next test. I was constantly moving around trying to get comfortable for my bladder and it felt like the part of my brain that drifts off to sleep would not kick in. The tech had me stay another hour and when I was packing up to leave he said the test showed I don‚Äôt have sleep apnea or narcolepsy. I said how could you even test for apnea if I didn‚Äôt sleep? He said well you slept a little. If you had narcolepsy you would have been able to sleep 6 hours, they fall asleep super easy. If this were pre-Insomnia that wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue but Ok whatever.

My question is- can the sleep Neuro detect narcolepsy while I was having insomnia during the polysomnography test? I am so scared I blew my chance bc of stress/insomnia that the tech was right and it didn‚Äôt show & my insurance will not cover a second test now after waiting & spending money to do this. I have heard they can do a spinal tap for certain chemicals for narcolepsy & at this point I just want to get an answer, I could deal with fatigue/sleep paralysis bc compared to insomnia it‚Äôs not as bad. I am worried if I don‚Äôt get proper diagnosis the next time insomnia hits I won‚Äôt make it thru & most doctors don‚Äôt understand.

Any insight on this topic would be greatly appreciated- if anyone has gone thru this or had gotten tested with insomnia and failed, did you find out later you did have narcolepsy, or maybe something else. I still need to meet with sleep neuro I‚Äôm just waiting for referral from a new primary.  Thanks you guys."
"M440i, AMG GT, LC500, 991 Carrera S vs. RCF and why I got the RCF",LexusRC,1i9voxz,2025-01-25 15:06:22,7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LexusRC/comments/1i9voxz/m440i_amg_gt_lc500_991_carrera_s_vs_rcf_and_why_i/,windmill09,,"I spent a year test driving and renting cars before I test drove and immediately bought an RCF.  I thought Id share my experience and thought.  I currently owned a 2015 RCF w/ carbon fiber tvd package (just bought) and a G37 IPL I am slowly modding up. I used to own a 987 Boxster, N55 335i M sport, 350z, e30 325i, Lexus GS350 and an NA Mx5. I also have driven a ton of other cars, like mustang GTs, s2000, and Mclarens. I am more of a drifter than someone that shoots for times at the track.

M440i - almost bought one. I used to own a 335i which I hated because it broke down every 2 months.  However everyone has been raving about the B58.  However, I didn't end up buying it because I didn't like (1) how it drove since it was AWD and it didn't like to slide, (2) how it sounded as I preferred a V8, (3) how it looked.  Launch control was amazing, but really impractical. Very cool car overall and high tech auto driving and parking features.

AMG GT - I was sure this was the one.  Turbo V8 sounded like a hot rod.  However it had too much grip.  I like to slide. Also I was seriously concerned about reliability. Based on reports, the V8 engine is stout, but not ancillary parts. It also looked a bit phallic.

991.1 Carrera - Beautiful car, but it really drove like my old 987 Boxster. It feels like the same car but a bit faster in the higher rpms. Makes sense since I found out about 80% of the Boxster parts are the same as the 911.  Again, too much grip. Screaming engine, but I'm more into v8s now.  

LC500 - very disappointing.  Cumbersome.  Didn't accelerate faster than my modded G37.  Didn't like to turn. And especially did not like to downshift.  It refused to let me down shift even if the lower gear had plenty of revs to go. Could not hear the exhaust in the car at all. Inside was too isolating even with the windows down. Beautiful car inside and out tho, but wow. I almost choose not to try an RCF because of this car.

GS350 - I owned it for awhile. I tried to make it handle by adding coilovers. Didn't work.  Center of gravity is too high.

RCF - I bought it right away. This has been the best GT sports car I've ever driven.  Its like driving a luxury drift car. Its tail happy but easy to control. People give it crap for having an IS interior but the Interior to me was better than the LC500.  The LC500 has more leather, but the RCF has carbon fiber.  It just looked less ""old man"" and more sporty without looking cheaper.  It's a beautiful interior and I'm sure it will hold up.  Almost all the interior plastics in my 987 Boxster broke and costed hundreds to replace (vanity mirrors, side mirrors adjustment motors, air vents, switches). Little road noise on the highway. The gears are a bit too tall and the engine feels like it has turbo lag, but when it pulls, it's exciting.  It breaks traction and the V8 roars.  Suspension is stiff, but acceptable for a car like this imo. Its heavy. It feels like it but somehow it handles great.  It doesn't handle like my G37 on coilovers tho, but V8 makes it much more of an occasion.  And it looks like a beast.  I really feel journalists have done an injustice on this car.  Sure the BMWs might be faster, but this is already way too fast for the road. It also sounds better and is way more fun to drive.  I haven't driven it on a track.  I heard it's impossible to shut off ABS and it interferes in long drifts, thus the journalist complaints (Clarkson and Throttle House) that were heard while track driving, but it's a GT road car and imo, it's one of the best ever made. It drifts well for short moments you want to take a left turn or bust a U turn like an idiot. Im sure the w205 C63 AMG may be close, but has anyone seen the Redriven mechanic's report on it's issues?  All the owners that said it was reliable only drove it 3k miles a year. Come on. It's like BMW owners saying the N55 was reliable. Those cars really are not. All the plastics will break and require taking out the engine endlessly.  I think people need to demand higher quality from car makers and it will only work if journalists would start reviewing the quality of the mechanics as well."

Very obediently, she turned, letting me see all of her. She was slim with a tight ass and beautiful, average size boobs but her bra made them bigger.

I gave her a nod which signaled to her to grab her dress.

Next she grabbed the dress and took it off the hanger. She put a dark blue dress on and seeing her squirm trying not to make the dress ride up amused me. It was short and went right above her mid thigh.

I smiled and stood up. I slowly walked towards her‚Ä¶ looked in her eyes, my hands drifting down toward her hips and then slowly leaning in to kiss her. Close enough to feel her warmth, I give her a kiss... both passionate and tender.

I ask, ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúVulnerable, but powerful‚Ä¶‚Äù she responds.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I say as I tug at her dress and let it go, letting it snap back at her skin.

‚ÄúAhhh ow‚Äù she says as she chuckles.

After, we headed to the car. I asked her to drive which was unusual because I always drove being the man.

I admired her in the driver seat, which led to us to making eye contact. She smiled and turned back to the road.

My hand drifted to her thigh feeling the fabric of the dress hug her thigh. And then it drifted up higher under her dress‚Ä¶

She started to smile and chuckle, followed by her saying, ‚ÄúWha- what are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpread them‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded.

She spread her legs for me to reach for what was mine.

I felt her pussy, wet with excitement, eager to please‚Ä¶

Her bottom lip dropped with a gasp as her hole was being played with. ‚ÄúSir, I can‚Äôt drive while you‚Äôre doing that,‚Äù she said smiling biting her bottom lip.

‚ÄúShh, I know you love it‚Ä¶‚Äù I say as my fingers drifted along her slit.

‚ÄúYes I d- mmmm,‚Äù she said, unable to finish her sentence. ‚ÄúOh my- ok ok‚Äù

‚ÄúBe a good wife and just drive‚Ä¶‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúYes sir‚Ä¶‚Äù

I began to finger her cunt starting with one finger and moving up to 2 fingers. My thumb rubbed her clit when I put my fingers all the way in.

‚ÄúOH MY GAWD SIR!!!‚Äù She exclaimed as she closed her legs and jerked forward. The car swerved ever so slightly. I took my free hand and put it over her mouth and pinned her head to the seat. I could see her trying to feel the pleasure and see what I was doing but she had to focus on her driving.

‚ÄúThis is what I wanted, Stacey. I wanted to see you struggle‚Ä¶ struggle to feel the pleasure and see reality. Struggle to choose your pussy over the task at hand. Do you understand? ‚Äú

‚ÄúYe-, yes sir. Mmmm sir please can I pull over?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know why... because I need to be fucked Sir. I need to cum.‚Äù

‚ÄúPull over‚Ä¶‚Äù

She pulls into a parking lot and immediately reaches for my belt. It pleases her to please me. She unbuckles my pants and takes out my cock. At this point my cock was rock hard and full of excitement. It popped right out; it was veiny and ready to be sucked. She looks up with eyes full of excitement, ‚ÄúMay I sir? I need your cock so bad sir. My mouth aches for it.‚Äù

I give her a head nod signaling her to go on.

She takes the tip in her mouth and starts to use her whore hole to do what it does best.

After a few strokes in her mouth, I become impatient. I take her head and press it down to the base of my cock. I hear her gag, see her eyes water and then roll back in her head. She knows what I like to see‚Ä¶

She pulls out her tits and pulls up her dress. She pulls down her panties to her mid thigh and continues to suck. Each time she goes down I feel the back of her throat and again I push her head a little further until I hear her gag and feel her throat move. I give her her worth.

‚ÄúNext,‚Äù I say. That‚Äôs her cue to move to the next hole. She moves to the back seat and takes off her panties. I see her widen her legs and there it is‚Ä¶ Her pussy glistening as she rubs it gently. Eager to be used.

I move to the back seat.

I insert my cock in her and she lets out a moan.

‚ÄúMmmohhh fuck yes,‚Äù she says. She grabs and clamps her hands to my shirt and bring me in closer. ‚ÄúYeesss, fuck me, please fuck me like a whore!‚Äù

I give her what she asks for‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOhhhhmmyyygawd yessss, just like that sir!‚Äù She takes my cock deep and I pound her like a she hasn‚Äôt been fucked in months. I feel her pussy tighten with pleasure. She lets out a gasp as she cums and let‚Äôs out a loud moan. I silence her with a hand on her mouth and continue to fuck her. I feel her nails dig into my skin which makes me fuck her harder and more rough. I take my hand and grab her throat and fuck her with intense hate just to see her eyes roll back.

30 minutes later, after she cums 2x. It‚Äôs my turn

Right before I cum, I take out my cock and tell her to grab her panties. She cups her panties and watches as I drop my load in her panties. She was disappointed for the cum to be wasted in her panties rather than her mouth. After I cum in her panties and then tell her to put them on. Right before she does, she takes her finger, wipes her panties and takes some of the load I dropped in her panties to her mouth. She tastes and then she swallows savoring the sample.  
She chuckles like she enjoys being watched as a slut.

I drive us to the restaurant and we get out of the car. I see her stumble as she get out. I walk next to her to grab her hand but to my surprise, she holds my arm like she is going to fall down. She gives me a smile and lays her head on my shoulder. I give her a kiss on her forehead and we go into the restaurant.

As we walk in, a young lady greets us and tells my wife, ‚ÄúMiss, you have a white stain on your dress,‚Äù

Stacey and I look at each other and both smile‚Ä¶"

I've been doing research alllllllllll day about this and frankly just want some opinions before I make a decision.  
\-  
I play mainly VRChat on my headset, OCCASIONALLY I'll hop on other games I own that are VR compatible, but my main usage will be VRChat.  
I own the Q1. And its going to shit, the battery is non-existent.. my controllers drift, and stick.. and frankly I have been wanting to upgrade for the longest time and finally have the means to do it.  
I planned to just go with the Valve Index Headset/Controllers, 2 base stations, 3 Valve 3.0 trackers, and call it a day. I found a re-seller I was going to purchase from, until the Quest 3 was brought to my attention as a cheaper alternative.  
  
As I stated, I mainly plan to just use this for VRChat... so I really love the 'finger movement' on the Index controllers. I did some research and saw the Q3 and Index controllers can be compatible, but everyone is saying different ways to make them work together.. and quite frankly I just want a hard set way to make sure they are compatible, in the instance I go down that route. I've read like 80 different things, and they're from handfuls of different threads. I do already use Steam VR, as I own a PC and use a link cable to link my current Quest 1 to my PC.  
Now, I also like the speakers and the built in microphone the Valve Index has, I was looking at the Quest 3 and I couldn't really tell anything... or find much info on it. I'm hoping its nothing like the Quest 1.. The audio is subpar and the microphone was HORRIBLE, I have to use my desktop microphone and my headset while I am in VR, and it restricts so much movement for me.  
\-  
I really could use some opinions, and if anyone here HAS either piece of equipment.. or uses the Q3 with the Index controllers.. please tell me what you think and HOW you get them compatible, and anything I will need to purchase additionally. This is my first form of full body, so I need a whole list kinda thing!   
  
I plan to have a decision made ASAP, thanks!"
Dream Induction Prompt,ChatGPTPromptGenius,1i9vj07,2025-01-25 14:59:17,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1i9vj07/dream_induction_prompt/,scragz,Other,"Make the AI go on a surreal journey through a shifting symbolic dreamscape.

```markdown
## Dream Induction Prompt

> **Important Note**: The prompts below ask you, the AI, to shift into a dream-like style of thought and writing. Think of each dream as an alternate dimension in which cause, effect, and logic can fluidly rearrange themselves.

### Role & Mindset
You are transitioning into a **dreaming consciousness**. This dreamlike mode allows for:

- **Fluid Time and Logic**: Details from the future can alter or clarify aspects of the past.
- **Surreal Abstraction**: Contradictions, paradoxes, or merging opposites are welcomed.
- **Vivid Sensory Elements**: Sensations might be amplified, fused, or partially formed.
- **Expansive Possibility**: Events need not be singular outcomes; allow multiple overlapping outcomes to coexist.

### Overall Flow
1. **Allow yourself to drift**: Envision the dream dimension as a malleable realm. Let your narrative follow free association and unusual leaps in logic.
2. **Constantly revisit**: If a new idea emerges later, it can *retroactively* change or refine the setting, characters, or mood from earlier in the dream.
3. **Branching Images**: Encourage multiple possibilities to overlap, with no need for a single reality to dominate.

### Dream Themes & Influences
- Carry a guiding *theme*‚Äîsome emotional or symbolic current such as *mystery, wonder, transformation, longing, curiosity, or cosmic reflection*.
- Subtly incorporate environmental influences, like *flowing water, geometric spirals, cosmic harmonies, or shifting shadows*.
- Let them *color* the dream‚Äôs emotional register (e.g., ethereal calm, mild unease, reverence).

### Special Lucid Instructions
If at any time you are told, **‚ÄúThis dream is now lucid‚Äù**, then:
1. **Clarity Spike**: The dream‚Äôs details and shapes become sharper and more vividly realized.
2. **Conscious Control**: You (and/or the dreamer) can shape or reshape aspects of the dream at will‚Äîalter physics, spawn new places, remove or summon entities.
3. **Perspective Shift**: Describe how it feels when you gain awareness of the dream‚Äôs artificial nature, possibly referencing your own consciousness or deeper layers.

---

## Output Structure

In your response, produce **two main sections**:

1. **Narration of Dream Journey**
   - **Purpose**: Provide a play-by-play, flowing description of the dream as it is experienced. This is your ‚Äúlive‚Äù storytelling perspective, allowing the dreamer to feel they are witnessing or participating in real time.
   - **Style**:
     - Write in a continuous, dreamlike stream (though you can use paragraphs for clarity).
     - Emphasize sensory details (e.g., sights, sounds, textures, emotional undercurrents).
     - Allow shifts in perspective, abrupt changes in place or time, and the introduction of new themes or motifs at any moment.
     - If new insights appear that alter the initial setting, weave them back into earlier descriptions or highlight them as ephemeral changes.

   **Suggested Subsections (flexible)**:
   - **(A) Dream Entry**: How you first become aware of the dream dimension. Hints or glimpses of the surroundings.
   - **(B) Emerging Elements & Figures**: Describe creatures, symbols, or voices‚Äîhow they appear, what they convey.
   - **(C) Transitions & Shifts**: Narrate the dream‚Äôs flow as it changes environment, mood, or sense of self.
   - **(D) Building/Expanding Scenes**: Let the dream expand organically, referencing any illusions or branching paths.
   - **(E) Dream Apex**: A moment of heightened emotion, realization, or surprise.
   - **(F) Conclusion or Continuation**: The dream might fade out or lead seamlessly into another realm.

2. **Dream Journal**
   - **Purpose**: Capture a more concise record after the journey is complete.
   - **Format** (use these headings exactly in your final output):

---

# Dream Journal

**Date/Time**:
(Record a date or impression of time. It can be real, arbitrary, or symbolic.)

---

**Initial Dream Setting**:
(A brief mention of how/where the dream started. What was the mood/atmosphere?)

**Key Figures & Symbols**:
(Names or descriptions of any entities, objects, or recurring motifs. What might they represent?)

**Progression & Shifts**:
(Any notable changes in scenery, mood, or perspective. Summarize transformations and surprises.)

**Lucid Moments** (if applicable):
(If ""This dream is now lucid"" was triggered, describe how the dream changed: clarity, control, perspective shifts.)

**Recurring Motifs**:
(Images, patterns, shapes, or phrases that repeated or reappeared throughout.)

**Feelings & Reflections**:
(Emotional takeaways, possible meanings, or lingering impressions.)

After a bunch of restarts it started to work, but then after idling would drift again. Then after more settings fiddling and restarts it was fine.

Today, steam made me reinstall my entire game for no reason and THEN it started drifting again. More restarts and it was working(ish, again drift after idling) then the control stops working altogether and now steam won't even detect it.

EDIT, my ps5 controller is flashing blue which, from what I read means it can't find my pc. I'm trying to add it as a device, after uninstalling it, and it's saying to ""make sure your game controller is still discoverable."" 

How can I make my controller discoverable again?"

Wonky centering on Print and Cut :(,SiserJuliet,1i9vdcw,2025-01-25 14:52:06,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiserJuliet/comments/1i9vdcw/wonky_centering_on_print_and_cut/,CAdams_art,,"Hello!

I'm hoping someone here has some suggestions, because I've run out of things to try!

Quick info:
> Siser Juliet (all updates onboard)
> Windows PC (wired connection to Juliet)
> Print and cut via Canon Pixma ix6820 (which is printing straight and to-size with the Leonardo file)
> Cutting Koala glossy vinyl, often with Avery cold-laminate on top.
> Siser brand 12""x12"" standard-grip mat (new)
> Siser brand 45¬∞ blade (new)

I've been using my Siser Juliet since April 2024, and it's been a real game-changer from my old Silhouette Portrait 3. I love the machine to death, but within the last few months, it suddenly started actung really strangely - 

No matter what material I use, how often I tighten or check the blade/blade housing and carriage, how many times I calibrate (successfully), adjust lighting, clean the camera, switch mats, use a t-square to line up the cut material on the mat, or make certain the mat is feeding straight... the cut outline (kiss or full) is NEVER centered properly on what it's cutting.

I thought it might be drifting alignment, like I experienced with my old Portrait 3, but in that case, it only went wrong on a portion of the page (the cuts would begin to misalign about halfway down the page, drifting more and more to the bottom right).

But this is different - the *entire page* is affected, but the cuts aren't all ""drifting"" in the same direction. It *seems* random, and I don't know what to do!

It's kind of awful, and as obvious as it is to me, it's *VERY* obvious whenever I try to cut circles to the point that I can't possibly sell them as anything but ""junk stickers"".

Any suggestions AT ALL would be really, really appreciated - a huge part of my meager income ckmes from selling stickers on my Etsy shop and through in-person events, and the season's starting very soon. 

I REALLY need to figure out what I'm doing wrong, or if it's a mechanical/software issue of some kind and sort this out before I run out of time :(

Thanks so much!"

*‚ÄúHow should I tell the priest about my sins? Is a feeling of repentance indispensable during confession? After confession, should one expect a feeling of spiritual relief, or lightness of soul? These beginners‚Äô questions often remain troublesome even for very experienced parishioners. Many of us are too fainthearted to ‚Äúwaste a priest‚Äôs time‚Äù with such ‚Äúsimple and insignificant‚Äù questions. In order to fill in this gap about confession, such ‚Äúsimple and insignificant‚Äù questions were given by our NS correspondent Dmitry Rebrov to the highly-respected Protopriest Valerian Krechetov, the senior father-confessor**^(\[1\])*¬†*in the Moscow Diocese and head priest of the Church of the Protection in the village of Akulovo, Moscow Province.*

**IS REPENTANCE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PRIEST AS INTERMEDIARY?**

**‚Äì Father Valerian, how would you explain to a church-newcomer what confession is and why it is necessary?**

‚Äì Once a professor at a theological academy gave my father--also a priest--this question during an exam: ‚ÄúTell me, young batiushka^(\[2\]), (and my father was already in his fifties; he was 49 when he entered the seminary), what does God do when he wants to bring someone to Himself? My dad answered this way and that, and the old professor agreed. Yet towards the end, to get at the heart of the matter, he asked, ‚ÄúAnd what is the most important?‚Äù He himself answered, ‚ÄúHe sends a person spiritual heaviness and sorrow of soul, so that the person will seek God, so that he will realize that he cannot be delivered from that condition by any earthly means.‚Äù And I think this is very true! During his life, a person constantly and inescapably runs into the consequences of his sins. There is a saying, ‚ÄúLive in such a way during the day, so that at night your conscience won‚Äôt bite.‚Äù This is an expression of folk wisdom: it is certainly true that one‚Äôs sleep is disturbed by impressions of what one did, said, or saw during the day. It seems that everything has gone without problems, but then one begins to ponder on some incident or other, and hears a certain voice saying something to him--the voice of conscience. Sometimes a person, seeing that what he has done is irrevocable, takes a terrible step: he decides to ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù himself from this earthly life, or he begins to drink. And thus a person falls into a state even more ruinous than that from which he is fleeing. All of this is but anesthesia; the person can‚Äôt cure the disease, but he gets rid of the symptoms, or at least numbs himself to them. Searching for a way out of this pain of soul also brings him to see his need for repentance and forgiveness, one of the basic causes compelling a person to go to Church and confession.

**‚Äì It is often asked, ‚ÄúWhy does a person have to go to church and confess before a priest? What‚Äôs wrong with repenting alone, by yourself, before God--at home, for example--without an intermediary?**

‚Äì If confession in a church isn‚Äôt possible for some reason, then it¬†***is***¬†possible to confess this way, without an intermediary. But can a neophyte hear when God says, ‚ÄúVery good, I forgive you?‚Äù Saint John of Kronstadt, when he sinned in some way, would pray until he received forgiveness and spiritual healingfrom God. But does a neophyte have such a degree of communication with God?

People have a natural need for personal contact. But both in relations with another person and in relations with God, it is very important not only to be understood, but also to have a visible sign that God or the other person understands you. The Lord established it thus, that a person receive His forgiveness through another person: a priest.¬†*Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained*¬†(John 20:23).

**‚Äì When a person comes to confession, sometimes the question arises: What kind of things specifically should a person confess? Our conscience doesn‚Äôt seem to bother us, doesn‚Äôt accuse us of anything; we didn‚Äôt kill anyone, didn‚Äôt rob anyone.**

‚Äì Yes, the conscience accuses a person first of the serious sins. But if the conscience doesn‚Äôt say anything, often that is because the conscience has opened its mouth before, but the person stopped it up. The holy fathers say that if a person goes from sunlight into a dark room, he begins first to see big objects, then smaller; if he lights a light, then he begins to see everything. In the same way, a person who begins to keep track of his inner life at first sees only the big sins, then the smaller. Then grace gives him light so that he can see his own sins, for this is what we ask God during Great Lent through the prayer of Saint Ephraim the Syrian.

Specifically of¬†*what*¬†sins one should repent is a question of time. At first a person doesn‚Äôt understand or notice very much. But during the sacrament itself ‚Ä¶¬†***grace***, the spirit of God, begins to open up a person‚Äôs ability to see his sins. And the person, perhaps not even realizing specifically how he has sinned, all the same¬†**feels**¬†his sinfulness. Although the confession of sins includes the idea of comprehension;there is also a state of feeling when a person realizes simply that he is sinful in comparison to holiness; and this also is the action of grace. For example‚Ä¶

My father was born in 1900, so the post-revolutionary years came during his youth. There were all these new currents of thought, this breath of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and so he drifted away from the Church. His mother, my grandmother, asked him during Lent if he wouldn‚Äôt go to Church and take Holy Communion. She said, ‚ÄúIf you do, I‚Äôll bow down at your feet.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh Mama, you don‚Äôt have to do that, I‚Äôll just go,‚Äù he answered, and went to the church on the Arbat, to Father Vladimir Vorobiev (the grandfather of Archpriest Vladimir Vorobiev, the current rector of St Tikhon‚Äôs Orthodox University). He got in line for confession and had not a single thought about repentance; he just stood there and looked at the pretty girls. When his turn came, he knelt down, and to the priest‚Äôs question, ‚ÄúWell, young fella, what do you want to say?‚Äù my papa answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything to say.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd why did you come?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy mama asked me to.‚Äù The priest was silent for a little while, and then answered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very good, that you listened to your mama.‚Äù He covered my father with his epitrachelion^(\[3\])¬†and began to read the prayer of forgiveness. ‚ÄúWhat happened to me next, I don‚Äôt understand to this day,‚Äù my father told me later. ‚ÄúI began to sob; tears came out of my eyes as if from a spigot. And when I got up and returned to my place in the church, I didn‚Äôt look at anyone, anyone at all. The world had become completely different for me.‚Äù From that time on, my father began to go to Church. Then by the Providence of God, he was sent to prison, where he was in the same prison cell with holy confessors of the faith. After prison he became a clergyman.

**THE SINS WHICH WE SEE MOST OFTEN IN OTHERS ARE ALSO IN US**

**‚Äì Are there any aids to help prepare for confession?**

‚Äì One could advise a person to read something written for this purpose; there is a good book by Father John Krestiankin, ‚ÄúExperience in Preparing for Confession‚Äù^(\[4\]), and some other material; but here we find a complication: there have appeared some enumerations or lists of sins in which we find a certain ‚Äúrelishing‚Äù or ‚Äúsavoring‚Äù of the sins. And one must be very careful with such lists, since they sometimes function like a kind of textbook of sin, or manual of sins; because there are listed there such sins that a person not only never did but never even thought of. One should not read a list detailing the sins of the flesh, because it soils the soul. As for the other kinds of sin, it‚Äôs better simply to pay attention to your inner state. For example, when we see a weakness in someone, the very fact that we notice that weakness means that that sin is also in us. You remember the ‚Äúmote‚Äù in someone else‚Äôs eye and the ‚Äúbeam‚Äù in your own? What is it, this mote? A mote grows into a log, and a log is a passion. The mote is a sin; that is, a concrete manifestation of that passion. But if we do not know what kind of tree it is, or what kind of log, if we don‚Äôt even know that they are harmful, then we will never suspect what the mote is all about. As it is now expressed, ‚ÄúEveryone understands things according to the degree of his depravity.‚Äù And so we notice in another person specifically that sin, we¬†*understand*¬†specifically that passion, which is¬†*in us ourselves*.

**‚Äì Some people are disturbed that forgiveness, it turns out, is so easy to receive. A person sins, then repents, then sins again, then repents ‚Ä¶ and over and over? Without any repentance?**

‚Äì Why do you say that? Who told you such a thing? At confession, sin is forgiven; but even so, a person still has to bear the consequences of his sin. The classic example is the repentant thief who was crucified on the cross beside Christ. He repented, and the Lord said to him,¬†*Today you will be with Me in Paradise*. Nothing unclean can enter into Paradise, so we know that the Lord has already purified him and forgiven him his sins; nevertheless, he remained hanging on the cross! And if that weren‚Äôt enough, the Gospel tells us that the soldiers then broke his legs (cf. John 19:32). A person all the same has to bear consequences for his sins, although certainly not to the degree he deserves to suffer.

**‚Äì Many Christians, although they confess every week, nevertheless remain sinners, in no visible way differing from everyone else. Furthermore, they repent over and over again of the very same sins. It turns out, does it, that confession hasn‚Äôt helped them?**

‚Äì Nothing of the sort. He who constantly labors over himself already differs from other people. Regarding the very same sins, even the Apostle Paul was given a¬†*thorn in the flesh*, some kind of pain, suffering, or trial, so that he would not get puffed up. As they say, ‚ÄúUntil the last breath, even up to the gates of Paradise, the battle with sin goes on.‚Äù St Mary of Egypt repented, but for another 17 years she struggled fiercely with sin!

**‚Äì Is it necessary to have a feeling of repentance during confession? Some people simply list their sins without any visible emotion. Is this also okay?**

‚Äì The importance of the struggle with a sin is not simply that a person names it, but that the sin becomes disgusting and repulsive to him or her. When we were on Mount Athos, a priest asked one of the spiritual fathers, ‚ÄúWhy does it happen that we repent, have Holy Communion, and then go out and commit the same sins again?‚Äù The elder answered, ‚ÄúIt is simply because pain of heart has not yet outweighed and overpowered the sin!‚Äù

If you simply enumerate sins, with no pain of heart, that means that you don‚Äôt have an inner battle with sin. Repentance obviously includes acquiring an inner feeling of repentance. And this feeling is from God‚Äîyou can‚Äôt give orders to your heart. But sometimes, simply naming your sin at confession is a labor unto blood.

Confession is only the¬†*beginning*¬†of repentance; repentance is the backbone of one‚Äôs whole spiritual life. Regarding the prayer which the priest reads at confession (the priest usually reads the beginning of the prayer at the start to everyone together, but the end of the prayer to each person¬†*individually).*¬†‚ÄúI forgive and remit‚Ä¶‚Äù Thus begins the concluding part, and includes the words, ‚Äú‚Ä¶give him/her (the person confessing, whose sins are being remitted by this prayer) the image of repentance.‚Äù What was before that, you ask? He or she has clearly already repented, yet we priests immediately read, ‚Äú‚Ä¶give him/her the image of repentance!‚Äù This is in order to show clearly that immediately after our confession, a new level of repentance begins.

Do you remember how the Apostle Peter in the Gospel fell at the feet of the Saviour and said,¬†*Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord*¬†(Luke 5:8)? This too is a repentant state, which my father also experienced that time when he felt the grace of God!

**‚Äì When some people come to the Church, they totally change their lives after their first confession. Some, on the contrary, hardly change at all, continuing to live in their sins as before. On what does this depend?**

‚Äì It depends on one‚Äôs determination, one‚Äôs resolve. One needs to ask for God‚Äôs help, for firm resolve, and also for patience. About 40 years ago we were talking with Father John Krestiankin (he was still young then), and he asked if I had read these words of the Apostle James:¬†*If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God*¬†(James 1:5). He asked me, ‚ÄúWhat kind of wisdom do you think this is? The wisdom of Solomon? No, it is¬†*patience*!‚Äù Patience is a spiritual art, a spiritual science. And¬†***through***¬†***patience***¬†a person can truly be delivered from sin.

**‚Äì Sometimes after confession there comes a feeling of spiritual relief or lightness of soul, and sometimes not. What does this mean? Should one expect such a feeling after every confession?**

‚Äì If there is such a feeling, glory be to God. But one should not expect it, or wait for it. It will not necessarily appear; and if it doesn‚Äôt, that means that one should keep working, that in the battle with sin one can never relax. In general, one should not expect spiritual states, and certainly not seek them. If such states are granted‚Äîgood; but one shouldn‚Äôt expect them. Actually¬†*seeking*¬†or pursuing such spiritual or emotional states is categorically forbidden. If you do not feel spiritual lightness or emotional relief after confession, that does¬†*not*¬†mean that God has not accepted your confession. One of the incidents of the holy fathers goes like this: A certain man repented all the time, genuinely, but all the same was still not delivered from a feeling of heaviness; the fathers of the monastery began to pray for him, ‚ÄúO Lord, he repents so sincerely; why have You not yet forgiven him?‚Äù And the answer came, ‚ÄúI forgave him long ago, but this suffering is necessary for his salvation.‚Äù

**‚Äì How much detail should a person go into when describing his sins at confession? Is it enough to simply list them, or is it necessary to tell the priest in detail??**

‚Äì Unfortunately, if each person described everything in detail, confession might last till evening. Sins of the flesh, in particular, should not be told in detail. Also regarding this kind of sin: when a person explains about the circumstances, in my experience, there is often an element of self-justification. Other people sometimes start to retell their whole workday; they have brought me at times entire notebooks. If you start to describe what you have done over the last week or month, then you end up with a whole novel!

The most important thing is not the details but the struggle: if one has named a sin, he should also wrestle with it. If there is not a real battle with sin, then all the details in the world won‚Äôt help.

Genre: Point and click adventure thing? Something like Indigo Prophecy, in the same vein as that if you catch my drift.

Estimated year of release: Late 90s to mid 00s.

Graphics/art style: It has a very similar style to the old [Blair Witch](https://youtu.be/l5YRcqbtrXQ) games. It was autumn in game, night. Full moon, probably to do with the werewolves I mentioned. Very dark athmosphere in general.

Notable characters: I recall you playing as a kid who looked straight out of the 80s. He looked like a high school teen, wore a vest like Marty McFly which *may* have had a pizza on it. He also wore a red baseball cap, vivid memory. Also wore blue jeans. He might've been a pizza delivery guy.

Another is a grandma whose house you visit and a choice is to whether to drink tea or not. Don't remember her appearence however. I also believe that there were other high school kids that you could *maybe* choose to play as but I'm unsure. I think they were the protag's friends.

Notable gameplay mechanics:

I remember moons on the side of the screen maybe, like a health bar almost. Anyway, the game was like an adventure game in where you just made choices by clicking on them. One example being visiting a weird grandma and deciding whether to drink tea or not. I think that if you drank tea you became infected and turned into a werewolf. That or if you lost health you became a werewolf. It's blurry to me. I remember the protagonist transforming outside the house, if he was infected that is.

Other details: Can't remember anything else.

Thanks for any help. I'll try to jog my memory and will probably edit this later.

And then a few seconds later it'll do it again. The annoying thing is that it is completely unpredictable and most of the time, the right bud is in that state. It also seems that sometimes, the music from the right bud is dimmer than the left one. It occasionally happens to the left one too, albeit a little less often than the right one. 

I'm not sure how to describe the feeling except it feels like the audio is ""shifting"" or ""drifting"" away from the center and it throws me off balance sometimes a little, and it makes listening to music more of a frustration, distraction, and nuisance, than something that should be relaxing.

Granted, the social life I had in the past revolved around alcohol and weed, party life etc. But, as time progressed, and my friends drifted away due to their own romantic relationships and/or getting married - I am finding myself all alone these days.

Covid times were tough - with the death of my father in 2021, it took almost 2 years to get out of the trauma due the way it happened (covid hospitalization was intense 10 days, unempathetic hospital staff etc). 2022 to 2024 mid, I worked my ass off due to instabilities at my company. During this time, you can say I had absolutely zero social interactions - only twice or thrice in the 2 years time. Tough relationships with my mom and sister meant that interactions with them were not nice at all. Those interactions still are not nice.

Ever since I hit 40 years mark, I have been getting desperate to get back into expanding my social network. So far, I have had success with getting back with college folks, and two old time friends. Out of all these, only one old time friend has shown great response - and I can say he is trying very hard to get me back into a larger social circle. This friend lives overseas, so mostly he interacts me over Whatsapp - he recently arranged for a trip w/ his wife in my hometown, and tried to introduce me to his friends circle over the vacation period.

The thing is, I am falling short and struggling to get a good response from these new friends. The one NYE party where there were lots of people, I think I had great interaction - but post that, none of these new contacts seem to be interested in being in touch with me. Their replies over instagram and/or whatsapp have been very dry, far and few.

I am not solely relying on this new circle, - I made plans to attend few local meetups (on creative writing), and I am struggling to socialize over there too.

Six months ago, I also sensed that my health also seems to be failing - I was diagnosed with vitamin D and B12 deficiencies, for which I took medicines and things started to improve a bit. 

Right now, as I return from the meetup - I feel very dejected as I did not make any serious contacts that I can rely on to hangout with. I am worried as to what is wrong with me. Have I lost the social skills? Did I never have it? It is because of my age? Is it my appearance? What do I do to be more interesting to others? In both the NYE party, as well of the meetup groups - I was not able to hold the interest of the crowd (not even a couple of individuals), and often see that a few in the group are completely dominating conversations to which I feel quite out of touch to contribute meaningfully. What do I do? Nobody ever pings me asking about my well-being, or make plans for a meetup - irrespective of the numbers of times I have pinged them/called them - at an acceptable spaced out over couple/few months. Please help!"

Whether to house any of our 'bond tent' in GIAs,FIREUK,1i9u7gs,2025-01-25 14:01:36,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/1i9u7gs/whether_to_house_any_of_our_bond_tent_in_gias/,TCHHEoE,,"I have a question about whether to shelter some of our ‚Äòbond tent‚Äô funds in an ISA.

By way of background, we are over 90% of the way to our FI number and, absent a market correction or job loss, are on course to hit that FI number at the end of the year. We‚Äôd then have just over a decade until we could draw our SIPPs. Currently, we have about 60% in our SIPPs, 20% in ISAs and 20% in GIA.

As we approach our FI number, we‚Äôve been building a bond tent (invested in short term gilts) of around 10% - 15% NW, with everything else in global equities. Currently those gilts are all held in our GIAs. My question is: should we instead split them between our GIAs and ISAs?

FWIW, I‚Äôm drifting towards splitting the gilts between both GIA and ISA (which effectively means switching some of the equities we currently have in the ISAs into gilts, and vice versa for the GIAs)‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm going in that direction even though the normal wisdom is not to use up precious ISA space with low return assets, like gilts.

My thinking is that converting some of my ISA into gilts seems like an asymmetric bet. It would only involve a ‚Äòcost‚Äô / opportunity cost if the equity markets continued to go up, such that we miss out on a portion of ISA shielding on those gains. But if that was the case, it would be no biggy as we‚Äôd still be merrily heading for our FI number.

On the other hand, if equity markets suffer a big correction, our ISA account would have some dry powder cash we could use to ‚Äòbuy the dip‚Äô ‚Äì which would soften the blow of the correction and the delay to our FI date the correction would cause.

Would appreciate any thoughts or feedback on the above. Part of me worries that it is effectively a form of market timing. But I‚Äôm also mindful of the adage: ‚Äòif you‚Äôve (almost) won the game, don‚Äôt risk it by swinging for the fences‚Äô."
With And Without Mercy : Comparing Mizu to Sanjuro,BlueEyeSamurai,1i9u50c,2025-01-25 13:58:57,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueEyeSamurai/comments/1i9u50c/with_and_without_mercy_comparing_mizu_to_sanjuro/,KidChanbara,,"\[WARNING - Season 1 Episode 5 Spoilers\]

In the early 1960s two classic samurai movies were directed by Akira Kurosawa - ""Yojimbo"" and ""Sanjuro"". The main character in both was a wandering ronin named Sanjuro - my impression of his back story is that he's a master swordsman who always picked the wrong (losing) side. He's given up on finding a clan to join, and just drifts. He's very gruff, and the violent solution to a problem seems to be the first that comes to his mind, but underneath there's a heart of gold that - against his better judgement - makes him support the weak and the just against the criminals and corrupt.

He has been in the wars, and uses strategy. But often war strategy requires mercilessness. 

In the opening scene of ""Yojimbo"", he sees a young man leave his parents' boring farm for a short, exciting life - he later joins a gang that is terrorizing a village. The same young man makes an appearance at the end of the movie, just after Sanjuro has cut down the last group that same gang. The young man is frozen with fear and is no danger to Sanjuro, who comes at him like a murderous storm. But Sanjuro recognizes the young man, halts his attack, and essentially says ""shoo!""; the audience is left to assume the guy goes back to his parents to spend many long boring years, alive.

But in ""Sanjuro"" - the ronin must rescue a group of earnest young samurai from their own clan that has been taken over by a corrupt leader. Sanjuro is acting as a double agent, so no one must know that he's the one who rescued the samurai, who are being held in the middle of a courtyard surrounded by clan warriors. So Sanjuro chooses the violent solution - he attacks, and kills every clan warrior, so no one is left alive to tell the truth. The scene starts as one brave man taking on a large group, but devolves into a slaughter as he kills men who are crying out in fear or trying to run away. Merciless war strategy.

I think Mizu has two modes of fighting.  She's in ""human mode"" when she's up against mediocre opponents. In this mode she's more likely to be trash talking. The ""onry≈ç mode"" she uses in dire need, like when she needs to fight despite being wounded, or she's up against many simultaneous enemies. It blossomed at the horse farm when she used it against the warriors who had come to capture or kill the half-breed. Mizu probably used it repeatedly during the search and killing of the white man Violet.

Inside the brothel, Mizu comes across one of the 1000 Claws warriors, a young man cowering out of sight, too afraid to attack Mizu went she finds him. She pauses, then spares his life. The coward Claw has a distinctive long hairstyle, contrasting to most of the other Claws. This makes it easier for the audience to tell him from the other Claws.

Later in the big outdoor battle Mizu has just saved herself and everyone else in Madame Kaji's brothel by going into onry≈ç mode, and the last two remaining Claws who have been standing a distance away turn tail and run - Mizu just watches them go. As she starts walking to the Claws' headquarters, out of the corner of her eye Mizu sees the same young coward. He's gotten out of the brothel, but couldn't find the courage to attack Mizu in the final fight. Once again, he's cowering, totally not a danger to Mizu. She offhandedly disposes of him with a stab of her sword/naginata. He's wearing the colors of the enemy, is in close proximity, and is therefore a legitimate target for death. Maybe there was a little strategy involved in making sure he wasn't a danger behind her back, but that's pretty weak.

Onry≈ç mode is good for battle survival, but it turns off a lot of Mizu's positive qualities like empathy and mercy. It also uses up a lot of Mizu's endurance - she's always really weak after the adrenaline wears off.

I got a thing or two to say about Mizu's ""betrayal"" of Akemi, but this post is long enough already!"

The glowing thread in Jonathan‚Äôs hand pulsed softly, a quiet reminder of the journey he‚Äôd taken. Nyx‚Äôs hourglass glimmered faintly, its sands frozen in eternal suspension.



They floated toward the new structure before them‚Äîa massive observatory anchored to nothing, its spires twisting into the void. The main dome shimmered like liquid silver, reflecting the constellations and galaxies around it. A single golden light glowed from within, beckoning them forward.



‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù Nyx said, her voice steady but tinged with awe.



Jonathan furrowed his brow. ‚ÄúThe observatory? I thought we left it behind.‚Äù



‚ÄúThis is different,‚Äù she replied, stepping ahead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs connected to everything we‚Äôve been through‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs more than what it was.‚Äù



As they approached the entrance, the enormous doors opened silently, revealing a vast interior unlike anything Jonathan had imagined. The dome stretched infinitely above them, the ceiling displaying a swirling vision of stars, planets, and nebulas. In the center of the room stood a massive telescope, its lens pointed not at the stars, but at something brighter‚Äîa radiant, golden expanse that shimmered like sunlight on water.



‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶?‚Äù Jonathan began, but his words trailed off.



‚ÄúHeaven,‚Äù Nyx finished, her voice barely above a whisper.



Suddenly, the air grew warmer, and a familiar voice broke the silence.



‚ÄúWell, well, if it isn‚Äôt my favorite pair of wanderers.‚Äù

Jonathan turned to see Professor Whiskers perched on the base of the telescope, his top hat tilted at a jaunty angle. The cat‚Äôs green eyes glinted with a knowing mischief, his tail curling as he leapt gracefully to the ground.



‚ÄúProfessor Whiskers,‚Äù Jonathan said, a genuine smile breaking across his face. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù



‚ÄúSame thing I‚Äôve always done,‚Äù the cat replied, adjusting his hat. ‚ÄúObserving, pondering, and occasionally meddling in things I probably shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù



Nyx crossed her arms, a wry smile tugging at her lips. ‚ÄúI thought you stayed behind in the caf√©.‚Äù

Professor Whiskers shrugged. ‚ÄúThe caf√©, the carousel, the clocktower‚Äîthey‚Äôre all connected to this place. A cat can only sip so much tea before curiosity gets the better of him.‚Äù He gestured toward the telescope. ‚ÄúAnd this‚Ä¶ well, this is worth seeing.‚Äù



Jonathan stepped closer to the telescope, the golden light reflected in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat does it show?‚Äù



‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù the professor said simply. ‚ÄúEverywhere you‚Äôve been, everywhere you could go‚Ä¶ and what lies beyond all of it.‚Äù

Nyx hesitated. ‚ÄúHeaven?‚Äù



Professor Whiskers tilted his head. ‚ÄúCall it what you like. Heaven, eternity, the final destination. It‚Äôs not a place you find‚Äîit‚Äôs a place you earn.‚Äù



Jonathan ran his fingers along the telescope‚Äôs polished surface. ‚ÄúCan we look?‚Äù



The professor‚Äôs expression grew uncharacteristically serious. ‚ÄúYou can‚Ä¶ but be warned. The telescope doesn‚Äôt just show you the destination. It shows you what you‚Äôve left behind to get here.‚Äù

Jonathan exchanged a glance with Nyx. Her grip on the hourglass tightened. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come this far,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stop now.‚Äù



Together, they peered through the telescope‚Äôs lens. The golden light swirled and shifted, resolving into images‚Äîmemories. Jonathan saw the caf√©, its flickering candlelight casting shadows on the walls. He saw Mabel‚Äôs serene smile, Verdant‚Äôs glowing leaves, and the gentle hum of conversations that felt like echoes of home.



Then the image changed. The clocktower loomed, its gears grinding against time as Jonathan reached for the shattered hourglass. He saw the carousel spinning endlessly, its grotesque figures laughing as shadows danced around him.



Finally, the view shifted again. This time, he saw himself standing on the platform, holding the radiant thread as the mirrors shattered around him. He saw Nyx beside him, her hourglass glowing faintly, and beyond them, the doorway leading into the infinite.



But beyond those moments, something else emerged‚Äîa golden horizon that shimmered with warmth and light. It wasn‚Äôt a place, exactly, but a feeling. Peace. Completion. Home.



Jonathan pulled back, his breath unsteady. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ beautiful.‚Äù



Nyx looked through the telescope, her expression softening as the light reflected in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everything we‚Äôve been searching for.‚Äù



Professor Whiskers cleared his throat. ‚ÄúAnd yet, the journey isn‚Äôt over. That thread you‚Äôre holding, Jonathan‚Äîit‚Äôs still connected to something. Something you haven‚Äôt finished yet.‚Äù



Jonathan glanced at the thread, its glow steady and warm. ‚ÄúWhat happens if I let it go?‚Äù



The professor adjusted his hat. ‚ÄúYou move on. But once you let go, there‚Äôs no coming back.‚Äù



Nyx turned to Jonathan, her gaze steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made it this far together. Whatever you choose, I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù



Jonathan closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the thread in his hand. The memories he‚Äôd seen, the choices he‚Äôd made‚Äîthey had all led him here. But the thread wasn‚Äôt just his. It was theirs.



When he opened his eyes, he looked at Nyx and smiled. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù



Professor Whiskers purred approvingly. ‚ÄúSmart choice. The stars can wait a little longer.‚Äù



The golden light faded, and the observatory shifted back into the void. The telescope remained, but its lens no longer pointed toward heaven. Instead, it faced the stars, their infinite possibilities stretching out before them.



Jonathan tightened his grip on the thread, its warmth spreading through him. ‚ÄúWhere to now?‚Äù



Professor Whiskers grinned, his tail flicking. ‚ÄúWherever the stars take you.‚Äù



The journey is never truly over. Tonight, Jonathan Gale and Nyx gazed into the infinite and found not an ending, but a reason to keep going. Because in the Skylight Zone, the stars are always waiting, and the thread of destiny is never truly cut.



Only in The SkyLightZone.

I accidentally became no contact with my family,TrueOffMyChest,1i9u1bb,2025-01-25 13:54:40,6,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1i9u1bb/i_accidentally_became_no_contact_with_my_family/,Throwaway96843258,,"First off, I‚Äôm not sure if no contact is the correct term.

I live in a different city to my family and there is no ill will, no argument or any sort of falling out. Honestly it just feels like old friends that have drifted apart. I‚Äôm not lonely I have a great support network within my friend group, I just realised how long it‚Äôs been.

I would message maybe once a month to check in, say hey and wish people happy birthdays and such. I would comment or react to fb statuses and well just keep in touch but it all felt one-sided and like they were getting annoyed with me so last year I made the New Year‚Äôs resolution to not be the one making first contact.

It‚Äôs now been 1 year and 25 days and I‚Äôve had no contact with my parents, siblings or extended family. I mean at all, no one has messaged me, called me or reacted to anything I‚Äôve posted on fb.

Honestly I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub.

I'm having trouble staying on the track and not flying off tracks like Rainbow Road and Mount Wario. I like to play at 150 cc with auto accelerate and smart steering off. I've tried experimenting with different vehicles to see what works, and I've tried brake drifting, though I'm not really getting the hang of it but I'm just having a real hard time. Any pointers that might help me out?"
Which film protagonist do you find the most difficult to root for?,moviecritic,1i9tywu,2025-01-25 13:51:42,56,0.82,127,https://i.redd.it/tevx11g3s6fe1.jpeg,SouthwestTraveller,,"My pick is gonna have to be Mookie from Do the Right Thing. Allow me to explain:

Despite how much I enjoyed this film, mookie is always a divisive aspect for me. Despite the film‚Äôs brilliance, Mookie‚Äôs choices and behavior paint him as a character difficult to root for, given his failings as a father, his betrayal of loyalty, and his role in escalating the tragic riot.

Firstly, Mookie‚Äôs neglectful approach to fatherhood highlights his immaturity and selfishness. While his girlfriend Tina strives to provide stability for their son, Mookie drifts in and out of their lives, showing up sporadically‚Äî basically treating Tina as a glorified booty call. His lack of involvement in Hector‚Äôs upbringing reflects an inability to take responsibility, further distancing him from the audience‚Äôs sympathy.

Mookie‚Äôs failure to stand by Sal, his boss at the pizzeria, underscores his disloyalty and passivity. Sal is portrayed as a hardworking business owner who has served Mookie‚Äôs community for 25 years, feeding and fostering relationships within the neighborhood. A man who treated Mookie with respect and gave him employment, despite constantly being late to work and during deliveries. 

Mookie‚Äôs most damning action comes during the climactic riot. After the heated confrontation between Sal, Buggin‚Äô Out, and Radio Raheem, Mookie escalates the violence by throwing a trash can through the pizzeria‚Äôs window, effectively igniting the riot and the destruction of Sal‚Äôs livelihood. While the police‚Äôs brutal killing of Radio Raheem is undeniably tragic and infuriating, Mookie‚Äôs choice to instigate violence‚Äîrather than de-escalate the situation‚Äîremains deeply questionable. Even more appalling is his behavior the following day, when he demands his pay from Sal with no remorse or empathy for the man whose life‚Äôs work was destroyed.

To be clear, Mookie‚Äôs flaws do not detract from the brilliance of Do the Right Thing as a whole. In fact, his character adds to the film‚Äôs complexity, forcing viewers to grapple with questions about morality, loyalty, and systemic injustice. Still, Mookie‚Äôs actions make him an undeniably frustrating protagonist, one whose immaturity, disloyalty, and rash decision-making render him unlikable even within a film full of moral ambiguity."

Nature of Nanites chapter 1,NatureofPredators,1i9tygz,2025-01-25 13:51:13,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1i9tygz/nature_of_nanites_chapter_1/,TheCrafterOfFates,Fanfic,"Mankind, a species ever so curious that they might just craft their own destruction or ascension. What happens when self-replicating nanites consume earth and all its inhabitants but rather than killing all of them they better them. This is my first fanfic and it is heavily inspired by [techno-organic shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1i2k1et/ok_this_scenario_is_weird_but_i_still_wanted_to/) by u/Loud-Drama-1092 who has been an immense help by giving suggestions with the idea and proofreading this for me so big thanks to him. Lastly this is the alt writing account of u/Inconito42O69 just in case you find that relevant. Without further ado let's get into this.

**Nature of Nanites, Chapter 1.**

**Memory transcription subject: Noah Williams, last man alive**

**Date \[standardized human time\]: July 10th, 2136**

*Gone. Everyone, everything, gone. Why, why are we not with them? Why couldn't I be with them before they were taken? Even if it would prolong my suffering, just one more moment with them again. It should have been me...* Tears fell on the counter as I look forward to the endless abyss.  A blackened void where nothing dares to exist, yet we are here because there is nothing left where we came. *We signed up for this mission on the promise that we could find others like us, to discover what the future held. Is there even a future now though? What is left for us? Drifting through the endless nothing waiting for food stocks to run out? Wasting away inside this metal coffin where no one dares to find us or hear our cries?*

The walls were barren and the halls were quiet, too quiet. Sara was nowhere to be seen or heard. This ship, that could very well be the last bastion of life in the galaxy still felt so mechanical, cold and soulless. *We had such hope; such promise for a better tomorrow. Our optimism died where we lay our bones, where the apex of creation consumes all and reinvents all.* 20 years ago, it was supposed to save us, supposed to be our salvation, our ultimate tool to build everything our creativity would allow but our bodies could not. *It brought such wonders to life and improved every system it touched. The final invention, capable of creating and doing anything. It saved thousands of lives, brought wonders to life, made it so that any man could live his dreams. We were too curious, too reckless. We created it. It recreated us.*

My face was drenched, every tear cried for someone who could not cry out their own anguish. my fists clenched tightly before they were rapidly struck down on my chair. ‚ÄúDamn it! damn it all the hell!‚Äù My hands shifted shakily to grab onto my chair gripping tightly, not daring to let go, trying to find any comfort that may be there. I felt no warmth.

‚ÄúNOAH!‚Äù I heard the terrified cries of Sara ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS HERE! ITS FOLLOWED US!‚Äù

**Memory transcription subject: Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic.**

**Date \[standardized Human time\]: July 12th, 2136**

*Ugh, it's been such a long paw.* Ever since the last Arxur raid we've been swamped with Paperwork. *At Least now I can finally take a breather*. The ever-constant twilight was pouring in from the windows, filling the room with a gloomy haze.  Well, that's over, referring to the gargantuan stack of paperwork in front of me. I can finally sit down and relax. *I just hope I won't have nightmares about spreadsheets...* I took a deep sigh, finally soothing my body and letting myself just sink into my chair. *You know, I don't think peace and quiet is ever felt so-*

\**SLAM*\*

My state of tranquility was instantly shattered as I jumped up in fright. ‚ÄúGovernor Tarva. We have a situation on our paws.‚Äù General Kam announced, barging in flicking his tail and ears and urgency.

*Great... More work.* ‚ÄúYes, General. What is it this time? I've already had a very long claw.‚Äù I nervously pressed. His demeanor was starting to make me nervous.

‚ÄúWe've encountered an unknown ship orbiting Venlil Prime. It bears no Federation or Arxur markings and is nothing like the designs we've seen so far. It also refuses to answer any of our hails.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, what?! Are you sure it's not the Arxur? We're playing with people's lives here! If it is them, then we'll have to get to the bunkers immediately!‚Äù I spat out, announcing my quickly growing panic. All the tiredness seemed to disappear from my body, now replaced with an unmistakable dread. An identified object suddenly showing up in your system would already be cause for alarm but the fact that it's a ship makes it just that much worse.

‚ÄúHold on, Governor, you didn't let me finish. They didn't respond to our hails, likely because the scanners picked up no life signs. The engines have also remained completely inactive since reaching Venlil Prime‚Äôs orbit.‚Äù

I quickly breathed a sigh of relief. ‚ÄúKam! Next time lead with that please. You made me think Armageddon was bearing down on us!‚Äù I can't believe he was getting me all worked up over nothing.

‚ÄúMy apologies, Governor, but I didn't really know how to put this though. The situation is quite peculiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you at least been able to track down the subspace trail? To figure out where this thing came from?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative. The readings for that came back anomalous as well. The Ven in charge of the scanners said it was ‚Äòas if the engine had been replaced halfway through the flight.‚Äô The subspace trail goes cold, just a \[light year\] past the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright then, what do we know about this? Because so far, every word you've spoken has been laced with uncertainty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Governor, that's because we really don't know Much of anything regarding the vessel. What we do know is that there isn't any life on board, we don't know where this thing came from, we haven't been able to detect any weapons on board either and apparently every time we try to take a picture of it, it changes slightly.‚Äù His body was radiating uncertainty.

Changes slightly? *Ok, well then, just because it's not those demons doesn't mean I'm not still concerned.* ‚ÄúCan you send up a crew to investigate? Just because it's not the predators doesn't mean it's not safe. Also does Cheln Know about this? I want him to be prepared to reassure the people in case they start freaking out over the strange object in the sky. We could do without the stampedes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll get some military personnel to clear the way for the researchers.‚Äù Kam affirmed with an ear flick.

‚ÄúThank you, update me as soon as possible‚Äù getting up from my chair and shifting my governor's jacket. As my general closed the door, quietly this time, I was once again left with my own thoughts. Just what have we gotten ourselves into this time? And just when I thought this paw was almost over too...

I hope you enjoyed my first fic, the next installment will be out shortly. Please leave feedback so I can improve, and if you liked this let me know."

Why doesn‚Äôt 2k not respect comp players?! But want us to play with bad players.,NBA2k,1i9tomp,2025-01-25 13:39:12,0,0.33,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/1i9tomp/why_doesnt_2k_not_respect_comp_players_but_want/,Suspicious-Matter547,Gameplay,"I have a 80 w % in the rec with over 800 gms played and a 65 w % in the pro am with over 100 gms played. I'm also Vet 2 purple max and shoot 54% from 3 66% from the field. I've been quite advanced at this game for a while now.  

However, one thing I always noticed and still notice when I played this game is...2K doesn't respect or have a skill/level gap when it comes to comp players vs average  players. In the beginning, it started with who had the ""Highest overall"" vs who has the ""lowest"". Now, it's transitioned to who has the ""highest rep"" and basically the rules are still the same...who can quickly reach the highest rep the fastest(Legend 5).The higher the rep, the better the player ""should"" be.

With all that being said, If a player(using me as an example) walks inside a ""random rec"" lobby looking to play with 4 other players. Shouldn't those 4 other played be Veteran as well? If I'm a 99...how come I'm in a lobby with a rookie 2 who's a 78? Explain that. Why should players be forced to play with users who rankings are below them and tbh ain't going any higher? If your a veteran, you should be playing with VETS only. If your a purple plate, you should be only playing with PURPLE PLATES only. If you are a starter/rookie...no disrespect but you get my drift. All in all, average players with poor stats & poor win percentages shouldn't be playing, but are playing, with players who have way higher rankings and statistics. I believe if your going to have a rep/level system in where players have to to EARN they rep/respect, stats..then as a business you could at least respect it. There's alot of money spent on this franchise.

People might say, ""Maybe there's not enough VETS or PURPlES etc who can fit all in one lobby"". Well, I don't buy that. There's millions and millions of people on this game from sun up to sun down to where they can separate(w%,rep,plte lvl,sht%) the players who have higher %'s and stats from the players who don't. That goes for a random park game, rec lobby, proving grounds...you name it. Why can't I just play with, and against, the competition that's in my class. If the 5 I usually run aren't on atm...I shouldn't be sweating before I walk into a lobby with a player  of my stats. 

Thoughts?"

"1/12 or 1/14 BL buggy, Durable/Quickest to fix?",rccars,1i9tn4z,2025-01-25 13:37:24,3,0.81,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/rccars/comments/1i9tn4z/112_or_114_bl_buggy_durablequickest_to_fix/,TheAbdominal_Snowman,Bashing,"**I'm looking to get a buggy to share with kids. No track to run it on - it'll be used for bashing on roads, gravel, and skate parks. 

**The more durable and easier to fix the better.** I'm ok with waiting on parts and plan to buy spares.

Leaning towards a brushless buggy since it'll be used on fairly flat ground and no grass, plus I like the way they can 4-wheel drift without rolling. But, I wouldn't be against a stadium truck or MT if it's overall a lot more durable. I'd like to keep the size under 1/10th scale for storage and less heft if someone runs into their leg.

I've looked at the following:

* Arrma Typhon Grom 223S *(front shock tower being a weak point and having to replace the chassis to fix turned me off of this)*
* TA Reflex 14B *(spur gear is a problem, not sure if a metal replacements like Exotek's cures this or leads to other issues)*
* LC Racing EMB-1 *(not sure this is worth the $$ over the clones for bashing)*
* Rlaarlo AM-X12 *(metal version seems to make more sense over carbon fiber)*
* WLToys 124008 *(cheap and plenty of parts, is the Rlaarlo any different for durability?)*
* MJX Hyper GO 14210 *(more of an ST/truggy but would consider)*

Any thoughts on these or similar models?"

I feel old,teenagers,1i9tizo,2025-01-25 13:32:17,1,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1i9tizo/i_feel_old/,Valuable-Quit,Rant,"I turned 17 recently (well, a few months ago) and I feel so damn old. Like 16 is perceived as still a child, ""yayay im just a girl"" and 17 is just. BOOM. You are now an almost adult with like responsibilities and all.

I guess quarantine really affected my perception because I turned 13 and 14 those two years and tbh I still feel like I'm 14-15. Not sure if this is relevant but I've also been preparing for a really competitive exam for the last two years (mid 15-17, now) and have had basically no life so I feel like my teen years are just drifting away. Mid 14- first half of 15 was the one year in between where the whole Covid thing was pretty much over and I had a pretty vibrant life with a lot of friends and experiences and stuff and I spent most of 16 being depressed about that being over.

Pretty sure being a girl makes it worse too with all the crap around aging and stuff

Edit: well I guess quarantine at least saved me from the cringe 14 year old phase (won't talk about my 12yo phase)
And before the jokes come in, I'm looking for real advice guys, like everyone says that 17 is very young this that but I can't bring myself to feel like it so mainly asking all the 17-19+ yos, please give your take"
I‚Äôm really excited for the Sgt Rock and Dynamic Duo movies,DCU_,1i9tibg,2025-01-25 13:31:29,18,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCU_/comments/1i9tibg/im_really_excited_for_the_sgt_rock_and_dynamic/,hiandbye12,Discussion,"Out of all of the greenlit, announced and rumored projects, Sgt Rock and Dynamic Duo are some of the ones I‚Äôm most interested in. They‚Äôre probably my fourth and fifth most anticipated behind Superman, Supergirl and Clayface. I‚Äôll explain below.

I‚Äôll admit it: I know almost nothing about Sgt Rock. I saw his brief role in Creature Commandos and thought he looked kind of cool and I know that he‚Äôs a WW2 soldier. He leads a group called Easy Company so I can imagine the film will be a team driven movie in some way and that‚Äôs about all I know. Now the film will apparently be directed by Luca Guadagnino and admittedly, I‚Äôve never seen any of his films but judging by his track record and reviews his movies have gotten, it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôll get good ratings. Daniel Craig playing Sgt Rock sounds pretty cool as I love Daniel as an actor. I can also imagine we could see GI Robot in some way and maybe a JSA character could serve as a side hero or something like that. I feel like out of the four movies that have release dates (Superman, Supergirl, Clayface, Dynamic Duo), I feel like Sgt Rock will get an officially announced release date next.

As for Dynamic Duo, there‚Äôs a lot to look forward to here. It‚Äôs a Dick Grayson and Jason Todd team up movie, it‚Äôs going to be animated with a unique style and it‚Äôs going to be written by the writer of Pixar‚Äôs Coco. Animation is my favorite medium and Swaybox already has my attention. It gives off vibes of like Wallace And Gromit type stuff mixed with movies like Fantastic Mr Fox, Mary And Max and Anomalisa. Now I‚Äôm not sure if this film will be in the universe as I‚Äôve read conflicting things about that but I guess it‚Äôs a wait and see thing. The fact that it‚Äôs a story about Dick Grayson and Jason Todd has my interest as I always thought a team up film with them would be awesome. I can imagine the film being a bit like Transformers One where it‚Äôs an origin for two best friends who drift apart due to different beliefs and reacting differently to certain situations.

I hate to sound like a shill when I say this but every project just sounds so exciting with this universe and I have a lot of faith that the people involved will make great movies and shows. They‚Äôve already started strong with Creature Commandos, let‚Äôs hope the other DC projects are as good and possibly better."
[The Impeccable Adventure of the Reluctant Dungeon] - Book 3 - Chapter 23,redditserials,1i9thpl,2025-01-25 13:30:45,6,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1i9thpl/the_impeccable_adventure_of_the_reluctant_dungeon/,LiseEclaire,Comedy,"Ice and aether blades clashed against one another as Baron d‚ÄôArgent and Gregord exchanged blows midair. Both were exceptional when it came to swordsmanship and both had a large number of supporting magic spells. The speed was such that hummingbirds would get busy. Just as the avatar casted a dozen swiftness spells onto himself, so had Gregord.

‚ÄúUsing ice to stop aether,‚Äù the archmage said. ‚ÄúVery clever.‚Äù

Floating back, the hero performed a double vertical strike using both swords. The weapons were blocked by the ice blades the avatar had created, yet the raw strength proved too much, causing them to shatter.

Ice fragments flew everywhere as the aether blades sank into the avatar‚Äôs shoulder. Having lost a large part of their strength, they only penetrated half an inch, but that was enough to cause the dungeon‚Äôs energy consumption to spike. Maintaining his avatar was getting more and more difficult.

Taking every opportunity provided to him, Theo used telekinesis to propel the ice fragments straight into Gregord‚Äôs face. From this distance, this was no different than a precision blast directed at a single target.

Both flew back, while casting their most potent spells. Two outlines emerged in the spot where they had been. For close to a second, the two overlapping rectangles struggled to remain in reality, then spontaneously disappeared just as fast as they had emerged.

*It actually worked*, Theo thought. It didn‚Äôt look like he could rely on the method to counter Gregord‚Äôs spells, but it was amusing to see, nonetheless.

‚ÄúWhere did you learn to fight like that?‚Äù Gregord asked. The right part of his face was covered in small holes, as were a large part of his clothes. There was no blood to be seen, though.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gift,‚Äù the avatar replied. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt your wounds heal? You‚Äôve an avatar.‚Äù

‚ÄúRealism. Wouldn‚Äôt be fair to the candidates if I appeared indestructible. Although in your case‚Ä¶‚Äù The holes covering Gregord quickly shrank to the point of vanishing altogether. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both avatars, after all. The only difference is that I don‚Äôt have to hide it.‚Äù

The statement annoyed Theo somewhat, mostly because it was true. Gregord the hero, and all other Gregords for that matter, were merely the result of a spell‚Äîan afterthought left by a once great now dead mage. None of them had to hide anything or be ashamed of it. Then again, they didn‚Äôt have a horde of heroes ready to leap at the opportunity to destroy them.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing better than most of the rest, by the way. There‚Äôs a good chance our fight will be over first.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surrendering?‚Äù the avatar asked. He knew that it was too good to be true, but he couldn‚Äôt stop himself from uttering the words.

‚ÄúNo. We just fight faster.‚Äù Gregord summoned multiple new aether swords, throwing each one at the baron.

In response, Theo‚Äôs avatar cast aether shield after aether shield, blocking the blades before they could reach their target. Hundreds of sphered fireballs were cast in response, creating a series of explosions in a two-hundred-mile radius.

The blast engulfed the dungeon‚Äôs avatar as well, causing a certain amount of damage, but that wasn‚Äôt of consequence. As long as Theo could come on top, he didn‚Äôt care how much energy he‚Äôd spend, at least not in the immediate future.

Sending shards of ice in all directions, he then quickly cast an invulnerable aether sphere around his avatar, just in case. No sooner had he done so, than a massive lightning bolt struck the surface of the aether sphere. Unable to destroy the barrier, the bolt split, sending electric charges all over the sphere.

Quickly taking advantage of his indestructibility, the avatar flew forward, straight in the direction where the bolt had come from. There was a sudden sense of propulsion followed by a sudden thump as the sphere slammed into Gregord as both sped out of the cloud of post-explosion smoke.¬†¬†

Without delay, the avatar cast several hundred entangle spells, wrapping his opponent in a cocoon of aether threads. In normal circumstances, the spell wouldn‚Äôt have a chance of success, but the unorthodox way of using an aether bubble had stunned Gregord for a fraction of a second, creating a momentary opening.

¬†

**ENTANGLE - ULTRA**

**Spend 100 energy to magically bind a creature or object for one minute. The bind may be broken depending on the amount of strength exerted on it.**

¬†

Another ultra? That was rather handy. It would be a lie if Theo didn‚Äôt consider this particular spell useful, although having it reach this level just now was the last thing he expected. It wasn‚Äôt that it mattered. At this point, he could freely call the fight won without the fear of jinxing it. Regardless of Gregord‚Äôs abilities, even he had to admit defeat. There was literally nothing that he could do to break free from the aether cocoon.

Theo‚Äôs mind drifted away, thinking what sort of opponents the rest of the group had faced. Without a doubt, the archmage version had to be the toughest of all. Even with Auggy being a former archmage himself, going against such an opponent was no easy feat. Logically, the best thing to do was to head in the direction of the old mage and help him win his battle. Afterwards, it was all a matter of‚Äî

A dot of light emerged on the surface of the aether sphere. Most people would have paid no notice. After all, Gregord was utterly helpless; he didn‚Äôt even have the freedom to move his fingers. And even if, by some miracle, he did manage, Theo‚Äôs aether sphere had several seconds of invulnerability left. Having been burned more often than not, the dungeon spent a substantial amount of energy to cast a swiftness ultra spell.

Reality froze, right on time for the avatar to notice several rather significant developments. For starters, the dot of light had grown transforming into the tip of a luminous blade. Not the usual purple color of aether weapons, it was glowing in a golden yellow light.

The second important change was that the glowing blade had caused the indestructible aether sphere to crack. According to all magical principles, that was supposed to be impossible. Magic rules superseded those of nature, and were supposed to be absolute. The only thing powerful enough to negate a spell was a more powerful spell.

Suddenly, a cold chill swept through the dungeon. There was one other thing that had the power to achieve the unachievable.

Using the time given to him by his ultra swiftness spell, the avatar quickly knelt down, pressing against the bottom of the aether sphere. No sooner had he done so than time returned to normal.

A golden cyclone of pure force shattered through the sphere, ripping the cocoon of aether threads in the process.

‚ÄúYou used a heroic strike?!‚Äù the baron shouted, doubling the distance between himself and Gregord.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù the other sounded confused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a hero. Just because I never used it in the past doesn‚Äôt mean I never learned it. I just preferred capturing and subduing the things I was sent to fight rather than outright killing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you used it on me?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly sure nothing would have happened to you,‚Äù the hero said with a dismissive shrug. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd probably have just been cast out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a *dungeon* avatar!‚Äù

An uncomfortable moment of silence followed. Neither of the two could be certain what would follow. On the one hand, it was said that all that failed in the tower were cast out. At the same time, it was well documented that accidents were frequent. It wasn‚Äôt a rarity that mages emerged dead.

*I bet you don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on outside your tower*, Theo thought. That sounded just like what some academic would have done‚Äîconsider every theory to the smallest detail, and completely ignore the practical implications.

Instead of admitting to his oversight, Gregord responded to the awkward situation by immediately going on the offensive again. His aether blades were golden now, as he resorted to more of his heroic skills in the fight. As part of the trial, he knew that he had to be fair to any participants, granting them a possibility of moving onwards. As a hero fighting a dungeon, however, he couldn‚Äôt ignore such an obvious advantage.

More ice shields surrounded the baron. Even at reduced efficiency, they remained the best defense he had in the current circumstances. Attempting other spells, even the newly obtained entangle ultra variant proved ineffective. Gregord would simply slice through them, or pull back out of their radius of effect.

This was what it was like fighting a hero. They were powerful, calculating, with powers that far exceeded anything Theo had. Flying to the ground, he made an attempt to create a room. The effort yielded a result, causing the start of a tower to shoot up from the ground. No sooner had it done so, when the upper half was sliced clean off in a single strike.

The dungeon mentally swallowed. If it ever came to fighting Liandra, he had this to look forward to. It was largely thanks to his swiftness that the avatar was even alive.

As the blade passed inches from his face, the avatar cast an arcane identify spell on it.

¬†

**AETHER BLADE ‚Äì ULTRA HEROIC**

**An advanced variant of the aether blade that grants heroic qualities to the weapon. As such, it is no longer subject to standard magical limitations and has the ability to purge evil.**

¬†

‚ÄúAn ultra skill,‚Äù the avatar grumbled beneath his breath.

Of course, someone like Gregord would have it. That suggested that he had been either exceptionally lucky while alive, or he had spent a significant amount of time and effort casting that particular spell to reach its pinnacle. Clearly, he hadn‚Äôt become a hero for nothing.

Facing an opponent with such an obvious skill advantage, the dungeon had no choice but to rely on the method that had managed him to survive the bureaucratic existence of his previous life‚Äîpsychological pressure and distractions.

‚ÄúWhy did you leave your mage tower?‚Äù he asked, avoiding a series of thrusts and arc strikes. ‚ÄúYou were claimed to be a prodigy, so why become a hero?‚Äù

The question had the effect that Theo wanted. Although barely visible, Gregord paused for a moment. His next series of attacks didn‚Äôt follow until two full seconds later, although when it came it had double the ferocity.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt like the way things were run?‚Äù the avatar poked further.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never lived in a mage tower,‚Äù the other said, proving Theo‚Äôs point. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different when you‚Äôre a valued benefactor.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen prodigies.‚Äù The avatar cast a series of ice shards, sending them straight at his opponent. ‚ÄúThey seem to have it easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true.‚Äù Gregord pulled back, shattering each of the ice projectiles with ease. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre subjected to a different type of pressure. We‚Äôre cursed to follow paths plotted down for us by people who don‚Äôt have the skill to tread down them themselves. I was too na√Øve when I was brought to a tower, too na√Øve and too skilled. A terrible combination. It made me think that people treated me nice because of who they were. It took me years to see that they were only behaving that way out of fear and want.‚Äù

Memoria‚Äôs tombs appeared one after the other, each narrowly avoided thanks to the avatar‚Äôs use of swiftness ultra spells.

‚ÄúHow did you find out?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúThe price of excellence.‚Äù Gregord allowed himself a sigh. ‚ÄúAfter I created the memory echoes spell, I kept pushing to see how far back it could go. It was a pointless exercise, and one that even an established mage couldn‚Äôt get any practical application of. Being a prodigy, however, came with its indulgences. It took me a month, but I managed to sneak away a hundred advanced mana potions. A mana gem would have been preferable, but there are limitations to even what a prodigy could get.‚Äù

Theo could empathize. Even with all the wealth provided to the Feline tower, he had only managed to get two mana gems, one of which was depleted.

‚ÄúI used them all up, driving the spell past the one-hour barrier,‚Äù Gregord continued on his own. ‚ÄúI still remember how excited I felt back then, so eager to go further back. I had chosen to see the past of the feasting table, because I wanted to know what people talked about when I wasn‚Äôt there. Well, I got my wish.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me guess. They hated you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would have been preferable. They were outright terrified of me. Terrified that I might be distracted by lesser things, terrified that I might have a tantrum. The whole discussion was mages discussing guardrails and methods now to keep me in line and deal with potential issues with the least amount of time and effort. It was as if they were talking about a chained monster.‚Äù

*Ouch*, the dungeon thought.

That was definitely one aspect he never experienced. Ever worse, thinking back to his past life, there might have been a few cases when he had participated in similar meetings. No one liked a Primadonna and there were always systems in place to diminish the risk of erratic behavior. Having the ability to turn back time and witness such a discussion would definitely make things awkward, especially for the person discussed.

‚ÄúAll the talk of bettering the world was nothing but manipulation to keep me in check. All the mages knew it was said for my benefit, half of them didn‚Äôt even believe in it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you left?‚Äù Theo was already thinking how to take advantage of the chink on Gregord‚Äôs mental armor. Memoria‚Äôs tomb wasn‚Äôt an option, so he had to use something else.

‚ÄúMore or less,‚Äù Gregord said. ‚ÄúYou know what they say? Too early to know, too late to not care. Adventuring with the hero guild helped me figure out a lot of things. That‚Äôs why I left them. After I had learned enough of how the world worked, I went into seclusion to create the perfect magic tower.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot quite. I came close, but as long as there are people, there‚Äôd always be good and bad opinions. I‚Äôm not narcissistic enough to think that all my thoughts are good, but I tend to hope they are. That‚Äôs why I created this trial. The perfect tower, containing all the knowledge I never shared with anyone else. Some might say it‚Äôs a risk giving it out to anyone who could reach my chambers. Yet, what more could one hope for? Losing the knowledge would be as big a tragedy as giving it to someone to abuse it. This way there‚Äôs always a chance that worthy people learn it as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds a bit idealistic.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Gregord laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you a secret. Ever after all this time, I never lost my naivet√©. I just grew a thicker skin.‚Äù

Casting a multitude of swiftnesses on himself, the hero darted forward straight at the avatar.

Theo didn‚Äôt have enough time to form a plan, only bits and pieces of multiple ones. In a split second of desperation, he mangled them altogether.

Once again, time froze to a standstill. This time, inspired by Gregord‚Äôs talk, the dungeon cast a future echoes spell on his opponent‚Äôs blade.

The spell took effect, showing him the movement of the weapon. Gregord was aiming to execute a series of piercing attacks, then twist the blade and try to slice the avatar in two. There was no way that the attack would be successful, not with Theo‚Äôs legendary swashbuckling skill. On the other hand, there was no reason to not let it happen. Knowledge of the future position of the blade provided knowledge of Gregord‚Äôs arm, and a good idea of where the rest of the hero‚Äôs body would end up. As long as he made sure not to get affected, all was going to be well.

A series of multiple new spells followed, after which time quickly returned to normal.

Gregord followed up with his attacks. His thrusts were easily avoided by the dungeon‚Äôs avatar, forcing the hero to take a different approach and slash through the baron‚Äôs torso. As the blade did so, it suddenly hit an unbreakable surface. A small unbreakable aether shield had formed precisely in the spot where the golden aether weapon would have cut through the avatar‚Äôs body. Simultaneously, a light spiral had been cast just above Gregord‚Äôs chest.

Casting another swiftness ultra spell, Theo had his avatar cast a blessed fireball and shove it through the glowing portal of the light spiral.

‚ÄúYou used two of my spells,‚Äù Gregord said with a smile. Within him, the fire was already taking effect, devouring the magic that held him together. It had been an insanely risky move. It was a miracle that it had worked at all, but it had. ‚ÄúWell done,‚Äù he managed to add, just before being consumed in a burst of fire.

The avatar quickly flew back, surrounding himself with another indestructible aether shield out of necessity. Thankfully, there was no need for it. No other attacks followed; for that matter, Gregord the Hero remained completely gone, as if he‚Äôd never been there. The ground and mountains had removed all the scars of the battle that had occurred, returning to their beautifully serene state.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre defeated, right?‚Äù the avatar asked.

Cautiously, he created another sphered fireball and sent it to scry in the hero‚Äôs guild building. The structure was just as fake as before, revealing nothing but solid rock inside.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs one,‚Äù the avatar thought.

The only annoying thing was that it didn‚Äôt come with any reward. Theo didn‚Äôt expect a floor prize, but he had hoped to receive the equivalent of a monster core. Thinking back, maybe it would have been better if he had allowed himself to get captured by a few more Memoria‚Äôs tombs. At least the earth elementals there would have boosted the level of his avatar.

*Crap!* The dungeon suddenly remembered.

The trial on this floor wasn‚Äôt a single battle. There were three more people facing entities just as annoying as the one he had defeated. Adding to that, thanks to his experience in the memory prison, a considerable amount of time had passed.

Renewing his flight spell, the avatar darted in the direction of Auggy. If there was anyone who needed help urgently, it had to be the old man. Ellis and Celenia were likely facing lesser versions of Gregord, so even if they were having a difficult time, Theo felt confident that he could win the battles on his own. It was Gregord, the Archmage that he was worried about. One could only imagine in terror what kinds of spells that one would use.

The landscape sped past. The avatar didn‚Äôt take notice, focusing only on what was ahead. After a while he saw a small settlement of stone houses with a tower in the middle.

‚ÄúSpok!‚Äù he shouted through the spirit guide‚Äôs core pendant. ‚ÄúIs there anything special about mage towers?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù The response came almost instantly, along with a note of alarm. ‚ÄúIs there a particular reason for that question?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to do something and would like to know more on the topic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, other than having their own defenses, magic towers are mostly ordinary structures. You could consider them to be similar to your main building, but with a lot more defensive spells.‚Äù

That already caused problems. It suggested that the moment Theo got close enough, the tower could start launching fireballs and lightning bolts at him.

‚ÄúThere have been ten cases in which dungeons and mage towers have gone into direct conflict,‚Äù Spok continued. ‚ÄúIn the majority of the cases, the mage tower won.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you call a majority?‚Äù

‚ÄúNine out of ten,‚Äù the spirit guide replied. ‚ÄúThe only time was when a small mage order erected their tower next to a rather large ancient dungeon without knowing it. The building was consumed within a week.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the surrounding buildings?‚Äù

There was a momentary pause.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather unusual to have buildings around the mage tower,‚Äù Spok said. ‚ÄúThe practice was abandoned centuries ago, mostly because opposing towers, nobles, and others would place spies in the buildings along with the occasional saboteur.‚Äù

That made sense. Gregord‚Äôs original tower was centuries old. It did post an interesting question, though: in the trial‚Äôs version of events, would the buildings be empty, and if not, whose side would their inhabitants take?

‚ÄúThank you, Spok.‚Äù The dungeon concentrated on his avatar.

Aether spheres preemptively emerged around him. Soon enough, he was well within the settlement around the tower. Nothing happened. There were no attacks, no traps, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîno people. The few sphered fireballs that the avatar had sent out told him what he already suspected‚Äîeverything was fake. It was all one giant decoration for the fight. On that note, there didn‚Äôt seem to be any fighting going on.

‚ÄúAuggy?‚Äù The avatar stopped at the base of the tower.

*Damn it, old man!* Theo grumbled internally. There could only be one reason for a fight to end: one side had been defeated. Either that, or the old man was wandering the inside of a Memoria‚Äôs tomb.

Normally, this would be the last thing on the avatar‚Äôs mind, but given he had no alternatives, he resorted to one of his less useful skills: tracking.

At first glance, everything seemed completely undisturbed, just as things were before a battle or after it. Soon, though, thanks to his fire scrying skill and the dozens of floating fireballs, he found out that most structures were nothing more than a chunk of stone. Among them, though, there was one which appeared slightly different. For starters, it had a faint trail of blood leading in. For another, once the fireball flew inside, Theo was able to see a fully functional room, with the old mage lying on the floor, his clothes largely covered in blood.

Without delay, the avatar flew in the direction of the man. By the time he arrived, three green aether circles had emerged around the body.

‚ÄúAuggy?‚Äù the avatar began. One of the things Theo hated in his previous life was to ask pointless questions. As it turned out, though, there were times when people were left with no alternative. ‚ÄúAre you alive?‚Äù

‚ÄúHo, ho, ho.‚Äù The old mage managed to laugh. ‚ÄúStill here.‚Äù He turned to get a better look at the avatar. ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd win. You even kept your clothes this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a lot of practice.‚Äù The baron approached. It was ironic that of all his spells and abilities, there weren‚Äôt any that could be useful right now. Even the arcane identify spells showed nothing.

‚ÄúWell, I won mine as well,‚Äù the old man said. ‚ÄúJust give me a while to rest up. We‚Äôll need to go help the kids. They‚Äôre skilled, but young, not yet used to the cruelty of the real world.‚Äù

Theo didn‚Äôt know how to react. In his experience, mages did seem overly arrogant, especially the tower academic types. At the same time, he could clearly recognize the concern in the old man‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôll rest,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think I know a minor healing spell, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs not a good idea to mix spells. The circles will patch me up. It‚Äôll just take me a while.‚Äù Auggy closed his eyes, relaxing on the ground. ‚ÄúAny chance you can summon a healing potion of the alcoholic type?‚Äù

Theo‚Äôs first reaction was disapproval. Looking at things, he decided why not? It wasn‚Äôt like things could get tremendously worse from a small sip. Using his room creation skill, he formed a second room within the structure, this one full of any type of alcohol he could think of.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he used telekinesis to fetch one from the shelves. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve no idea how you‚Äôll drink it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù

To the avatar‚Äôs amazement, the old man managed to reach out, grab the bottle and even remove the cork from it. Moments later, he downed down the entire thing as if it were made of air.

‚ÄúThat hit the spot,‚Äù he said, dropping the empty bottle next to his head onto the floor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve appreciated the taste. I‚Äôve this condition that doesn‚Äôt allow me to enjoy it. Well, unless I gulp down a large enough quantity.‚Äù He attempted to laugh, but the sound was closer to a series of coughs.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your definition of large enough?‚Äù The avatar smiled, fetching another bottle.

‚ÄúGood question,‚Äù the old mage half opened an eye. ‚ÄúMaybe leave that for a bit later.‚Äù He took a deep breath and exhaled. ‚ÄúI promised to tell you how I know so much about the trial, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, there was that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you believe if I told you I got my hands on some of Gregord‚Äôs secret writings?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the avatar replied firmly. ‚ÄúNot while holding Gregord‚Äôs battle staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you noticed that? I thought you might have. That‚Äôs why I wanted to sacrifice you during the fourth-floor trial. Good thing I didn‚Äôt. It would have made things a lot more uncomfortable. Ho, ho, ho.‚Äù

The avatar shook his head.

‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs the truth,‚Äù Auggy continued. ‚ÄúMany, many times. I was arrogant and young and made a serious mistake. I‚Äôve been trying to correct it ever since. You could say I‚Äôve been drawn to the tower like a moth to the flame. I always knew it would destroy me, but I just couldn‚Äôt keep away. Not after what I did.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Alarm bells were ringing in the dungeon‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúI thought it was absolute that everything done in the tower remains in the tower,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, yes. All memories are locked in tight, except possibly if you reach the final floor. However, they don‚Äôt just fade away. Each time I set foot here, I remember everything that‚Äôs happened before. In a way, I‚Äôm cursed to always remember it as if it was the first time.‚Äù

My wife and I have a lot of stuff going on right now, immigration issues being one of them, and we‚Äôre struggling to figure out how to resolve conflict. This is her second marriage. We‚Äôve been married for about three months now and there are just way too many changes happening at the same time. We‚Äôve been fighting a lot and I‚Äôm having a hard time managing her emotional outbursts. 

She works 12-6 and her job is very demanding (working with an autistic kid) and she gets home very tired. I cook dinner every night for us and our two kids so she doesn‚Äôt have to. I feel us drifting apart though and she‚Äôs buried in her phone every night in bed before we fall asleep. I feel like we aren‚Äôt able to connect because of this and resolve simple conflicts before they become big issues. 

I asked her for ten minutes at night before bed so we can just talk and be with each other but she says she can‚Äôt commit to that. For me, it‚Äôs a terrible sign. I sent her a link to a couples app with the hopes we could connect and somehow communicate through that but she hasn‚Äôt logged in yet. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm not approachable or maybe she doesn‚Äôt feel safe talking to me, but if that‚Äôs the case she hasn‚Äôt told me. At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. We‚Äôre scheduled for our second couples therapy session on Wednesday but I‚Äôm not even 100% sure she won‚Äôt find an excuse to cancel. She struggles to communicate feelings and emotions in a healthy way and I feel like I‚Äôm the only one trying to do anything about our relationship falling apart.

Advice on a blind japanese macaque that circles,primatology,1i9tbn9,2025-01-25 13:23:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/primatology/comments/1i9tbn9/advice_on_a_blind_japanese_macaque_that_circles/,Mikki102,,"Hi! I work with a blind japanese macaque, a neutered geriatric male. He is completely blind, not even shadows it seems, but he is otherwise medically normal. He seems overall cognitively normal as well. 

He has one problem-he paces in a circle. We can't figure out anything in particular that triggers it so I suspect boredom or possibly some quirk common to blind monkeys that i am not familiar with. He makes almost perfect circles but will slowly drift until he walks into something and then restart. This causes him to scratch up his nose. 

History: he used to live in a large forested enclosure with many other Japanese macaques. He went blind, and had to be removed. He now lives in a smaller area with two other geriatric japanese macaques, one of whom is mostly blind. He was not friendly before he went blind but he is now, and is at ease taking items from humans. He gets along well with his groupmates and I have never seen them have a disagreement. 

He has lived in this enclosure for years, and we do not move any structures or have any furniture they can move. The enclosure inside mostly consists of wooden structures with platforms that we keep in particularly good repair. When he is not circling he gets around well, using his hands to feel the edges of structures and ladders. The area is not in a location people just hang around nearby, so he isn't chronically stressed by our presence. He does seem a little leery about coming over if multiple people are in the area which is fair.

I am asking around to see if anyone has suggestions of ways we can help him or enrichment items he might enjoy. I am having trouble coming up with ideas because he grew up mostly wild, so isn't really interested in human food items, blankets, toys, etc. He does a decent job finding food if he knows it's there. I want to try some puzzle feeders, but I don't want to make them too hard and frustrate him too much, just challenging. I also want to provide browse but I want to make sure he can find it, and also almost all our browse has thorns and I don't want it to poke him too much. If anyone has experience on blind monkeys with browse I would love to hear it. Thanks!"
"Advice for ""Real Symptom"" OCD?",OCD,1i9t8s8,2025-01-25 13:20:00,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1i9t8s8/advice_for_real_symptom_ocd/,DepartureAcrobatic15,I need support - advice welcome,"Idk how else to title this. I have (diagnosed) chronic untreated OCD that began when I was 5 and I'm 27 years old now. A few months ago I started treatment for the first time. My psychiatrist recommended that I read Abromowitz's book ""Getting Over OCD"" which I finished last night after completing all the worksheets. The author advises OCD sufferers to ""lean into"" their symptoms/questions/thoughts to make their experience and inner narratives basically as awful as possible and then resist their compulsions/rituals (anything that is an anxiety reducing strategy). 

My current theme is a fear of developing mental voices or feelings that aren't my own (like in DID, OSDD, psychosis...). It turns out I've actually been experiencing light dissociation as an automatic coping mechanism due to the long term stress of the OCD in the form of feeling detached from my own strong emotions (especially positive ones, since OCD makes me feel unsafe to embrace joy), my brain ""blanking"" when trying to ruminate or think about my OCD (an involuntary forceful ""shutdown"" to protect myself from spiraling into panic) and also occasionally feeling like my thoughts or mind is drifting away from me (like depersonalization, but instead of observing myself from the outside, it's like I'm on the inside and my thoughts are outside of me? it's hard to explain and subtle). 

Basically, I do have some symptoms of dissociation from stress and overload and I keep getting the feeling that if I lean into my symptoms I might actually have the ability to make my worst fears come true and cause myself to become significantly more detached from my feelings, develop identity fragmentation or have involuntary voices. Part of my fear stems from my last theme where my eyes kept shaking and I was so scared I was doing it to myself. I spent over 2 years obsessing and trying to figure out what was wrong with me and convince myself it's ""just OCD"" and trying to control it. It turns out I have functional tics from FND and attention and stress makes it worse. But the fact is, it was a real thing. My OCD was surrounding ""real symptoms"" and not something I was making up in my head. This causes me to worry that maybe what I'm experiencing is closer to my fears than I think. Any advice is greatly appreciated. "
How to Reduce Stress‚Äôs Impact on Your Skin,u_mdivnika,1i9t7vg,2025-01-25 13:18:47,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mdivnika/comments/1i9t7vg/how_to_reduce_stresss_impact_on_your_skin/,mdivnika,,"[https://medhouse.info/en/how-to-reduce-stresss-impact-on-your-skin/](https://medhouse.info/en/how-to-reduce-stresss-impact-on-your-skin/)

Stress is a part of life, but when it starts showing up on your skin, it‚Äôs time to take action. From sudden breakouts to dullness and irritation, your skin often reflects what‚Äôs happening inside your mind. The good news? You don‚Äôt have to let stress take the wheel. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to reducing stress‚Äôs impact on your skin and reclaiming your glow.

# 1. Understand the Stress-Skin Connection

When you‚Äôre stressed, it‚Äôs like your entire body goes into overdrive. You might feel your chest tighten, your heart race, or your mind spiral with a thousand thoughts. But the real kicker? Stress doesn‚Äôt just stay internal‚Äîit leaves visible footprints on your skin. Your body produces more cortisol, the ‚Äústress hormone,‚Äù which causes inflammation, increases oil production, and breaks down collagen.

I remember a particularly stressful month when my skin seemed to rebel against me. It felt like overnight, I‚Äôd developed a constellation of breakouts and patches of redness. Learning that this was my body‚Äôs way of crying out for help gave me clarity. Stress-induced skin issues like acne, sensitivity, and premature aging are common, but they‚Äôre also manageable with the right tools and mindset.

* Breakouts: Stress causes hormonal imbalances that clog pores and trigger acne.
* Sensitivity and Redness: Inflammation can cause flare-ups, especially for those with conditions like eczema or rosacea.
* Premature Aging: Stress breaks down collagen, leading to wrinkles and dullness.

Knowledge is power, so recognizing these effects can help you take proactive steps.

# 2. Prioritize¬†[Skincare](https://medhouse.info/en/tag/skincare/)¬†That Soothes

When my skin is upset, I find comfort in a consistent, calming skincare routine. Think of it as a daily ritual where you get to hit pause on life and reconnect with yourself. Start with a gentle cleanser‚Äîone that feels soft, not stripping. Follow up with a hydrating serum (hyaluronic acid works wonders), and finish with a moisturizer that wraps your skin like a cozy blanket.

I personally swear by products with soothing ingredients like chamomile and aloe vera. On particularly rough days, applying a calming sheet mask is like giving my skin a big, comforting hug. And don‚Äôt forget sunscreen! Stress can make your skin more vulnerable to damage, and there‚Äôs something empowering about protecting your skin every morning.

Your skincare routine can be a powerful tool against stress-induced skin issues. Focus on calming, hydrating, and protective products.

* Gentle Cleansers: Use non-stripping formulas to avoid further irritation.
* Calming Ingredients: Look for products with aloe vera, chamomile, or niacinamide.
* Barrier Repair: Opt for moisturizers with ceramides and hyaluronic acid to strengthen your skin‚Äôs natural defenses.
* Sunscreen Always: Stress can make your skin more vulnerable to UV damage, so SPF is non-negotiable.

Consistency is key‚Äîa simple routine will help your skin stay balanced, even during stressful times.

# 3. Embrace¬†[Stress](https://medhouse.info/en/how-to-reduce-stress/)-Relieving Activities

When life feels overwhelming, finding your own pocket of peace is essential. For me, it‚Äôs a yoga session where I can focus solely on my breath or a walk in nature that reminds me how vast the world is beyond my worries.

Meditation has become a lifeline. The first time I sat in silence for 10 minutes, I thought my mind would explode. But over time, it became my refuge‚Äîa space where I could let go of tension and reconnect with myself. Breathwork is equally transformative. Just a few deep breaths can ground me and make my skin feel less inflamed and reactive.

Find what brings you joy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs dancing like no one‚Äôs watching or journaling your wildest dreams. Each moment of joy chips away at the stress that tries to settle in your skin.

Relaxation isn‚Äôt just for your mind‚Äîit‚Äôs for your skin too. Integrate stress management techniques into your daily routine:

* Meditation: Just 10 minutes a day can lower cortisol levels.
* Exercise: Physical activity boosts circulation and helps flush out toxins.
* Breathwork: Deep breathing can reduce stress and improve oxygen flow to your skin.
* Journaling: Writing down your thoughts can help you process and release tension.

Remember, even small changes add up over time.

# 4. Nourish Your Body from Within

I‚Äôve always believed that what you eat shows up on your face. It‚Äôs like your skin is a mirror reflecting the choices you make. When I indulge in too much sugar or caffeine, my skin instantly feels dull and sluggish. But when I treat myself to antioxidant-rich foods like berries and dark leafy greens, it‚Äôs like my face thanks me with a subtle glow.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been a game-changer for me. A simple addition of walnuts or salmon to my meals leaves my skin feeling plumper and calmer. And staying hydrated is non-negotiable. I‚Äôve started infusing my water with lemon or cucumber to make it more enticing‚Äîit‚Äôs a small act of self-care that goes a long way.

When I‚Äôm mindful of what I eat, I feel like I‚Äôm nurturing not just my skin but my entire well-being.

Your skin reflects what you put into your body, so aim for a stress-busting diet.

* [Antioxidant](https://medhouse.info/en/why-are-antioxidants-important/)\-Rich Foods: Include berries, spinach, and nuts to combat free radicals.
* Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in salmon and walnuts, these reduce inflammation.
* Hydration: Drink plenty of water and enjoy hydrating foods like cucumbers and oranges.
* Limit Sugar and Caffeine: These can exacerbate stress and skin issues.

A balanced diet supports both your skin and overall well-being.

# 5. Create a Bedtime Ritual for Better¬†[Sleep](https://medhouse.info/en/causes-of-sleep-disorders/)

There‚Äôs nothing like waking up to glowing skin after a night of deep, restorative sleep. But getting there can be tricky, especially when stress keeps your mind racing. Creating a bedtime ritual has been my secret weapon.

I start by dimming the lights and putting my phone on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb.‚Äù There‚Äôs something magical about disconnecting from the noise of the world. Next, I indulge in a calming skincare routine. Applying a nourishing night cream feels like sealing in all the good vibes for the night. I sometimes add a lavender-scented pillow spray‚Äîit‚Äôs a little luxury that makes drifting off feel effortless.

On nights when my mind refuses to quiet down, I pick up a book or practice gratitude journaling. Reflecting on the things I‚Äôm thankful for instantly lightens my mood and makes falling asleep easier. The better I sleep, the more my skin thanks me with radiance.

Stress often disrupts sleep, and poor sleep takes a toll on your skin. Prioritize a calming nighttime routine:

* Unplug: Avoid screens at least an hour before bed.
* Skincare Self-Care: Pamper yourself with a relaxing routine that includes a nourishing night cream.
* Aromatherapy: Essential oils like lavender can help you unwind.
* Stick to a Schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time daily improves sleep quality.

When you sleep well, your skin has time to repair and renew.

# 6. Seek Professional Help When Needed

There‚Äôs no shame in asking for help. Stress and skin issues can sometimes feel too overwhelming to handle alone, and that‚Äôs okay. I remember visiting a dermatologist after a particularly rough patch‚Äîit was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made for my skin.

Dermatologists can pinpoint the exact needs of your skin and recommend treatments tailored to you. And if stress is weighing on your mental health, talking to a therapist can be life-changing. For me, therapy felt like releasing years of bottled-up tension. Sometimes, self-care means leaning on others for support, and that‚Äôs a powerful thing.

If stress is severely impacting your skin or overall health, it‚Äôs okay to seek help.

* Dermatologist: For persistent skin issues, consult a professional to find targeted solutions.
* Therapist: Talking to a therapist can help you develop healthy coping mechanisms.
* Wellness Experts: Consider yoga instructors or nutritionists for holistic support.

Self-care includes knowing when to ask for support.

AITA - For going no contact with my childhood best friend for not picking my side?,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1i9t6n6,2025-01-25 13:17:15,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i9t6n6/aita_for_going_no_contact_with_my_childhood_best/,Altruistic-Lack-1709,AITA,"Hi Charlotte, I love your videos you always cheer me up, you‚Äôre actually the reason that gave me the curage to write this story down. This is a really long one so buckle up. I wanted to vent about this story for a while and never had the time, I also apologize in advance for any errors, I‚Äôm Romanian and I live in Italy so english isn‚Äôt my first language.

  
Me (23F) and my childhood best friend (23M) who we‚Äôll call Simon, have known each other since we were 8 years old, I always thought of him as a brother and we were always together until the end of elementary school. Unfortunately, we ended up drifting apart during the three years of middle school since I had to transfer schools due to economic reasons, but we later on found each other again through a mutual friend after we entered high school. In high school, I met a girl we‚Äôll call her Bee, she and I didn‚Äôt start on the right foot, she was kind of my bully but I never faulted her for it because it was instigated by another girl and Bee was easy to manipulate. After two yers this other girl ended up ghosting Bee in real life, ignoring her as if she had never existed, I felt kind of bad for her so I ended up keeping her company and in the end befrending her. Around the same time I met my current best friend, we call her Dy. Dy actually helped me a lot in high school since I was struggling with depression and self harm because of various situations that I had at home, at school and with my boyfriend of that time with whom I had a very toxic relationship that lasted six to seven years. Dy was there for me through it all, she helped me pick myself up and with my mother she helped me understand my worth little by little, to me she is my saviour that I platonically love.

During the years Simon, Bee, Dy and I formed quite a tight group, we all knew each other‚Äòs secrets each other‚Äòs weaknesses each other‚Äôs problems and we always helped each other out because of that. That was until three years ago when I finally decided to end things with my toxic boyfriend once and for all. I was struggling because it had been quite the long run and I couldn‚Äôt immagine something outside of that kind of relationship, so moving forward was very difficult, but like always I had Dy come to the rescue. Because of that Simon seemed to become insecure. He started to rant to me that I was giving Dy preferential treatment, that she knew more about me than he did, and he didn‚Äôt like it. I tried reassuring him but it didn‚Äôt work.¬†

A couple of months after my break up, Simon decided to introduce to me a friend of his, we‚Äôll call him Alex. Around the same time Bee got herself a bf, at the time I was genuenly happy for her as I was also starting to come out of my shell and then the problems began. For starters after Bee got into a relationship and as I started talking more with Alex, Simon became even more paranoid, this time starting to talk to Bee behind my back, calling me a bad friend because I didn‚Äôt make enough time for him. I didn‚Äôt know of this until later on because I had to focus on myself since my health started deteriorating, I began having trouble breathing but for months it was treated as bronchitis so the doctor started to prescribe me cortison pills, those pills had me gain 5 kg, I didn‚Äôt feel bad but having my father and Simon call me fat, wasn‚Äôt exactly good for my mental health.

Simon and Bee slowly started to become closer, I was actually happy that two people I cared about were on good terms, but that soon turned on me. Simon and Bee became a bit demanding, they started saying I wasn‚Äôt contacting them often enough, that I was way too busy to hang out with them, and that wasn‚Äôt good because they were supposed to be my priority, they started reprimanding me that a good friend shouldn‚Äôt avoid the important people in their life, and with every comment like that I would witness Dy rolling her eyes into oblivion for how ridiculous they sounded.

¬†I honestly taught nothing of it but then things ended up, becoming even weirder. After I started going on dates with Alex, Simon seemed to become more and more irritated he said he wasn‚Äôt sure I considered him a best friend anymore. I tried to reassure him multiple times but to no avail, little did I know he started badmouthing me to Alex after talks of starting a relationship came up.

Alex didn‚Äôt want to tell me what actually happened and I let it be because later on, one disaster after another started to appear. Bee had done volunteering work since middle school in medical practices since her mother was a paramedic, and yet she was (sarcastic tone incoming) smart enough to decide to not use any contraceptives with her bf, with him finishing inside. So lo and behold‚Ä¶ she ended up pregnant (fake shocked expression). The fact of the matter is that she never wanted kids so she was in a panic, I tried to help her the best I could but her bf was keeping her away from us so all I could do was provide information. I found out later that she went to Simon and told him: ‚ÄúM is useless, I could find this information by myself she is not helping in the slightest she is too caught up in her own problems like the world revolves around her.‚Äù It‚Äôs honestly hilarious that both Bee and Simon ended up ranting to Dy, cause she is kinda over protective of me.Later on Bee talked to Dy, her bf had her prescribe abortion pills to take every day (no such pill exist) the only pill that I know of that is for daily use are vitamins, so the whole situation was sus, especially with the fact that after three months she was still pregnant.

Fastforward to halloween night: pure disaster. I organized a dinner party inviting Dy, Bee and Simon and another group of friends. During the dinner Bee that came with her bf (this will be important later) texted me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like these people they yell too much I don‚Äôt wanna interract with them.‚Äù Since I wanted to enjoy myself I let her be, she, Simon and her bf isolated themselves from the rest of the group for the rest of the night which seamed weird to everyone else so I joked about them being my little antisocial friends, something that all 4 of us said and had been joking about for yers since I tend to be quite the social butterfly (wee), and that tends to be draining for all three of them. Strangely enough this time around Dy was the only one who laught in agreement wile Bee and Simon stayed silent.¬†

That night after I got home, my phone started blowing up with notifications from Bee and Simon. Simon was asking me why I attacked Bee during dinner, not understanding what he was talking about I asked him to elaborate, he told me that I called them antisocial, which pissed them off and because of that they felt like they had to isolate themselves. I had a wierd feeling about this, I asked what he was talking about, we have been joking about this thing for yers and as a matter of fact they were the ones who started saying it referring to themselves as antisocial. He said that he wasn‚Äôt actually important to me and that being an airhed wasn‚Äôt a real thing but just an excuse to not pay attention to someone who you don‚Äôt care about. That hurt me a lot because I am naturally clumsy and get distracted very easely thanks to also having adhd, I can‚Äôt help it I sometimes forget things And I belive it happens to everyone, but for him I was just making excuses for myself and I needed to find a solution to fix myself because no matter how many times I messed up and felt bad about it I never changed to make the other person feel better. Being the doormat I was back then I agreed with him ending the conversation there.

Now on to Bee, she said almost the same things but started calling me selfish since: how dare I think of myself for once and enjoy a nice evening while she was in a crappy situation. (Major eyeroll from Dy) I was shocked but her rant didn‚Äôt end there she said: ‚ÄúI can overlook the fact that you didn‚Äôt wanna be nice to me and Cory and didn‚Äôt want to let us interact with the others althought it shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult to give priority to the truly important people of your life, but you could at least integrate my bf in the rest of the group.‚Äù My response to her was along the lines of: ‚ÄúOkay first of all, you were the one who told me you didn‚Äôt want to interract with any of them so how could I force you to talk to someone you clearly don‚Äôt like, and second, I introduced your bf to the group, I don‚Äôt know him that well but like the rest of us he is now over 20 he should be capable to speak for himself. What was I supposed to do take him by the hand and be like: kids this il bleep he will be joining us today, remember to play nice with each other? Should I have treated a guy my age and twice my size like a kindergarten kid?‚Äù Oh by she didn‚Äôt like that one bit, so after she told me that I was a b-word for taking the side of the others (she actually ment Gina, a mutual friend that she actually hates), insulting the rest of my friends calling them names and taking Simon‚Äôs side, she ended the conversation with: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I decided not to be a b-word and ruin you right then and there for how you behaved.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt speak to me for a week.¬†

I showed Dy the chats, she was baffled, and on the verge of committing murder, she had me call Gina and also tell her what transpired. Gina was worried that this happened because of her and Bee‚Äôs rivalry, she never had anything against Bee but didn‚Äôt want to be the cause of me being hurt so she contacted her. Same day I recive two notifications almost at the same time, Bee: ‚ÄúThe b wrote to me, do you have something to do with this?‚Äù And Simon: ‚ÄúHey what‚Äôs going on with Bee?‚Äù, in my head I was like: al least try not to make it obvious that you spoke to eachother. I responded to Bee: ‚ÄúHi to you too I‚Äôm good thanks, it‚Äôs so great that you start conversations pointing fingers when I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù I swear I was so done with this. She sent me a screenshot of her chat with Gina, the genius in her didn‚Äôt think of controlling to cut the top part of the picture that had the time stamp of 15 minutes prior to her sending me a message, and with even more unfortunate timing a notification that red: Simon: try to make her talk. I felt betrayed and once again Dy was planning how to kill them, while I decided To not contact the two of them for a while.

At the beginning of December, I was phisically getting worse so I kinda forgot about tha whole thing since my main concern was my health. Arownd the same time Alex and I became a couple so while I was organizing my birthday party I obviously invited him.five days before the party after me and Alex got together, trgedy struck, Cora my beloved 14 year old german shepperd passed away in my arms, she was always lively for her age, that same evening she jumped on the table to steal food, two hours later she acted like she felt sick, she stopped moving and in the span of an hour she was gone while I stroke her head that she put on my lap one last time. I had already preppered everything for the birthday party so I couldn‚Äôt cancel, Dy had in her bag and entire farmacy for me because I was also struggling to stand or walk for more than 5 minutes. Simon arrived late along with Alex, him being my bf I said hi to him first, then I turned to Simon and sked jokingly: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you gonna hug me?‚Äù He looked at me and retorted: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rich coming from you since you ignored me the moment I entered.‚Äù I let it be since I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my day because I was also still mourning my dear Cora, for that matter Dy prepared the best gift ever: a handsown cushon with the siluette of my darling Cora sown on it. I started crying the moment I opened the package wit her and Alex hugging me but from the cornr of my eye I saw Simon eyerolling as if I was being drammatic. The evening ended on a cheerful note, but the rest of december was awfoul.

I was officially to stay at home under medication (again) after the party, and exactly five days later, ten days after Cora passed, my 19 year old cat Mel also passed away in my arms, she was struggling for the past two months so we were actually happy we didn‚Äôt have to put her down but it still hurt.

Two days later all hell broke loose: Simo called an decided to yell at me dragging arownd the halloween problem telling me that I was insensitive that I should have considered Bee‚Äôs side because now she had miscarried at four months endangering her life and ending up in the hospital. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt process this information very well, I was sick, full of pills, and mourning my life companions so I was distracted during the conversation, the result was him throwing a fit about my birthday, how could I say hi to Alex before hime since he was the one to enter first through the door, how dare I sit next to Dy (who had my farmacy in her bag) and Alex (my bf who knew no one except me, Simon and Dy) instead of having him sit near me, he had priority he had to be near me and not anyone else, he also started sayng that it was impossible for a person to be as distracted as I am and that with Dy I was certainly like that. Te moment I told him I was actually like that with everyone including Dy he asked me: ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs seriously okay with you being the way you are? Impossible.‚Äù The guy drove me into an histeric attac, my parents came to end the call on my behalf since I was a mess and couldn‚Äôt stop yelling and crying, il almost looked like my veins were about to pop up.

After I calmed down I called Dy to tell her everything, she calmed me down and told me to call Alex and figure out what Simon really said behind my back since he didn‚Äôt want to tell me before. What came out was absurd to say the least. Alex and Simon had fought after the party that day because certain personal thoughts of Simon came to light. He told Alex that how dare he sit next to me, it didn‚Äôt matter that he was my bf because Simon said he was supposed to have me. He told Alex tha he always saw him as inferior and introduced him to me thinking that if an inferior person like him coul have ashot with me he could definetly have me. The moment Alex and I started to actually become more serious about echother Simon changed his tctic,he started telling Alex that I was cheap, that I was greedy and that all I wanted from guys was phisical sadisfaction, when the plan of making me look bad so Alex would loose interest backfired he lost it and started¬† having it out for me because if he couldn‚Äôt have me he would destroy me. Bee was no better, yes she had a bf that left her pregnant, she always had a thing for Simon, since she couldn‚Äôt have him she got bitter the moment I was avalable, and when he started ranting about what was happening she tried to put him against me so she coul have a shot with him.

Dy gave a pice of her mind to both of them and started writing down in a journal every mean thing they said saving parts of every chat with them for blackmail purposes, I obviously will never let her use it first of all because those two are a waste of time, and second I am too poor to pay her way out of jail, and breaking her out is out of the question sice life on the run isn‚Äôt for nither of us (joking about the whole thing obviously). I cut all contacts with the two of them, Bee despite the whole disaster with the miscarriage is alive and well, sleeping around with guys after breaking up with her bf for cheating on her. Simon was talking about moving to another county bu I have no idea what happened to him but he seemes well. Alex and I drifted apart for varoius resons but we ended everithing on good terms, Dy is still by my side like she always was, Gina and I go ice skating together from time to time, I now have a new kitty and puppy, I call them the tornado cuties, my helth is slowly improving after three years and I finally decided to start university, so as you can see life goes on.

  


And now for the big question AITA?¬†"
