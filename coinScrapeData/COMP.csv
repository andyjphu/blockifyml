Trapped in a Life That's Falling Apart,offmychest,1i9w8op,2025-01-25 15:30:42,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i9w8op/trapped_in_a_life_thats_falling_apart/,J3llyB3lly92,,"
I don’t even know where to begin. I moved to the other side of the world to be with him, leaving behind everything I knew—my family, my friends, my support system—because I believed in us. Now, I’m in a country with no one to turn to, surviving off intermittent workers’ comp payments while dealing with overwhelming health issues and stress that seem to compound by the day.

Our relationship has been falling apart for a long time. The intimacy has been gone for ages, replaced by lies, gaslighting, and broken promises. I’ve tried everything—communicating, compromising, giving chance after chance—but he’s become so detached, so indifferent to me as a person, that it feels like I don’t matter anymore. His gaming addiction has taken over, and I feel like I’ve disappeared completely from his world. I have been fighting desperately, but I'm not just fighting alone, I'm fighting against him. I don't have the resources for it anymore. I'm sinking and I have to make a choice - I cant afford to not chose me. 

I feel utterly trapped. I don’t have the money to leave, and he can’t afford for me to leave him with all the debt we’ve accumulated if I move back to my home country. Even so I have nowhere to go - I am no contact with family, and drifted away from friends. And even if I do - I'm leaving disabled and I don't know how to begin rebuilding with nothing. ’ve lost everything I once had—my career, my home, my future, and my sense of self. I can’t see a way out.

Before we got together, I went through IVF with donor sperm because I wanted to start a family after years of infertility. I fought so hard to make that dream happen, but it failed. Later, I made the heartbreaking decision to discard the embryos because, if I ever had a child, he wanted it to be his. Now, I’ll likely never have children—I can’t afford IVF again, and my eggs aren’t viable for much longer.

My injury at work was another devastating blow. I hurt my dominant hand and wrist and have since been diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a condition that causes constant pain, swelling, and loss of function. It’s made even the simplest tasks excruciating, and fighting workers’ comp for recognition and support has drained what little energy I had left. The stress from all of this has wrecked my health—I’ve been losing hair, far too much weight, my blood pressure and heart rate is up, my mental health is deteriorating, and my body feels like it’s falling apart under the weight of it all. I'm in therapy, I'm trying to make the right choices and awareness of my thinking etc, all skills I've had to instill in myself over the years. But I'm falling apart physically, and grappling to keep my head above water mentally.

What makes this even harder is how much I fought to get to this point in my life. I’ve overcome so much—childhood trauma and abuse, abusive relationships, losing my best friend and housemate to suicide (we had been planning to start IVF together before he passed), an ex cutting me off from the kids I raised because I wouldn’t get back together with him, a painful divorce, and my brother’s death. My mental health was atrocious, I never knew anything but survival mode, until I really started fighting to heal 5 years ago. There were times when I didn’t think I’d survive, but I fought tooth and nail to recover. For the last four years, I’ve been stable and rebuilding my life. For the first time, I thought I was finally getting that peace and reward for holding on. For the first time ever I felt secure.

Now, it feels like everything is being ripped away from me again. My marriage, my health, my future, my dream of children—it’s all crumbling, and I feel powerless to stop it. I’m heartbroken, exhausted, and completely lost.

It makes me question our entire relationship - how unwilling he is to work with me or compromise, or just show me that he cares about me. The years of feeling undesired, making me wonder why he was ever with me. His words often say one thing while all his actions say another. He lies so easily, for the most unnecessary stuff to the biggest stuff. He's been completely okay watching me fall apart and I can't help but wonder if it was all an act. I was okay before I came here. I found peace in my own company & I was okay with the life I was living - to travel, to have a kid alone. And I'm so bitter. I gave everything into this life, and I'm left with nothing. 

I've been telling him for so long that we can't keep going as we are, that we are dying and there will reach a point we can't come back. That I can't keep fighting alone, I'm running out of resources. And it just gets worse. And I could feel myself returning to a place I never thought I would return to. My sign I have to detatch. I vowed I had to fight back in the day, because I wouldn't make it out of that headspace if I ever returned - so I make sure to always do what I need to stop myself slipping. So here we are - I've just bought furniture to turn our lounge into my room, and I think its probably a weight off for him. He's been sobataging for so long, he can rest easy. I just cant believe this is my life. I love him, because he's not a bad person, but I fell in love with someone else. Someone who made me feel loved, secure, prioritized and safe. I'm grieving the person I thought I had, and the future I've lost. And the fact I wasted so much energy and time begging the wrong person for the most basic stuff - to feel desired, to have SOME quality time, to not get lied to, not get gaslit, to follow through on your promises. To treat me the way I treat you. It's so damn embarrassing. I'm battling resentment he wasn't able to give me what he once could before he got comfortable, and just sad acceptance that we just aren't compatible. It's so hard to grieve when I feel like life won't let me catch my breath. "

This is one of the biggest updates in Algorand history. The network will now reward participants who propose blocks! Algorand is unique because of the following:

* **No slashing risk**
   * Staked Algo is not subject to slashing. Instead, ineffective nodes are algorithmically removed from consensus and simply forgo rewards.
* **No lockup period**
   * On Algorand, independent validators maintain control of their Algo at all times. Staked tokens remain in a user’s wallet while securing the network as part of consensus.
* **Low cost**
   * Running a node on Algorand is extremely cheap. All you need is a computer with 16GB of RAM, fast SSD, and 1 Gbps internet connection.
* **Real-time rewards**
   * The initial rewards for block proposers are 10 Algo + 50% of txn fees per block. On Algorand, rewards are paid out as each block is finalized, every 2.8 seconds, and your stake automatically compounds, instantly increasing your voting power.

**Why is this huge?**

This will make Algorand one of the most **egalitarian**, **democratic**, and **decentralized** blockchains in the world. You don't need a data center or crazy hardware to run a node. Anyone can run one on a mediocre laptop or minipc! Algorand to me lives up to the ideals of Satoshi, anyone, anywhere can help secure the chain and liberate themselves from the shackles of traditional finance. This brings us one step closer to the dream of a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Now, lets get into the weeds!

Recommended system specification for **participation** nodes is:

* 8 vCPU
* 16 GB RAM
* 100 GB NVMe SSD or equivalent
* 1 Gbps connection with low latency

Personally I run my own on a Beelink Minipc and it runs flawlessly (https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8845hs). Please note, this is above the required specs and you can find cheaper ones that will run flawlessly.

There will be many options for node running depending on whether you have access to the required hardware and ALGO requirements.

1. **Solo staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * By running an Algorand node you become an active contributor to this decentralized system. Your node, acting as an independent validator, helps prevent fraudulent activity and ensures only valid transactions are added to the blockchain. Node runners contribute to ensuring the robustness of Algorand infrastructure which benefits developers, applications, and users across the ecosystem.Participating nodes also have voting rights on network proposals, allowing you to have a direct say in Algorand’s future development.
2. **Liquid staking (any Algo amount)**
   * Liquid staking applications allow users to stake their Algo while maintaining liquidity. While each platform is unique, the typical process asks users to deposit Algo and mint new tokens that represent the ownership and value of the staked Algo and can be used across the [DeFi ecosystem](https://algorand.co/ecosystem/defi). 
3. **Staking pools (any Algo amount)**
   * Staking pools enable groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to stake their Algo to a validator and get rewarded based on the rewards the validator receives. Unique staking options are also available, such as staking via DEX liquidity pools (which requires committing Algo plus another asset). 
4. **Delegated staking (min. 30K Algo)**
   * Delegated staking involves utilizing a third-party to run a node on the your behalf while your Algo remains your wallet at all times. This provides an option for users who want to help secure the network and collect rewards, but don’t have the knowledge or resources to run their own node.

If you choose to run your own node, there are many different options for getting your node up and running. From command line interface purism to one-click solutions. Currently, I use FUNC, which is a one click option for Windows that is extremely simple and easy.

* https://algorand.co/run-a-node
   * Nodekit (https://nodekit.run/)
   * FUNC (https://github.com/GalaxyPay/func)
   * A1C (https://github.com/AustP/austs-one-click-node/releases)
   * Manuel Installation (https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/)

The minimum amount needed to run your own node and get rewards is 30,000 ALGO. Keep in mind, you can still run your own node with a lower amount, **as little as .1 ALGO**, you just will not get rewarded.

If you don't have the required 30,000 ALGO you can put your ALGO in a liquid staking pool and get rewards. There will be many different platforms to do so. Below is a non-exhaustive list.

* Pera Algo Wallet (https://perawallet.app/?download=true)
* Folks Finance (https://app.folks.finance/liquid-staking)
* Tinyman (https://app.tinyman.org/liquid-stake)
* Pact (https://www.pact.fi/)
* CompX (https://app.compx.io/staking-pools)
* Messina One (https://messina.one/liquid-staking)
* Valar (https://stake.valar.solutions/)



You will also have the ability to setup your OWN pools and let people stake to your pools via Reti Pooling. The Réti Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized staking pools on the Algorand network, enabling groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to trustlessly stake to a Validator and earn yield based on the rewards the Validator receives.

* [https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme](https://txnlab.gitbook.io/reti-open-pooling/introduction/readme)
* [https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti](https://nodely.io/docs/public/reti)



I also assume the major exchanges will allow you to earn a percentage back on any ALGO you keep on an exchange.

Help be a part of decentralizing Algorand and get paid in the process!

**Exciting times are ahead! I hope you're Reti!**

Long story short, next year I will break 6 figures. This is my first time ever making this kind of money.

Currently: paying down middle class debt I have (2 car notes and 2 CCs), investing about 12% into a deferred comp., company match 6% 401k.

Plan: Start and fund Roth within 3 months.

Advice needed: Very new to index funds, ETFs, etc.

I guess my overall question is what else can I do to compound my money with the least volatility? We're comfortably living on about 62k/yr and the extra 40ish will supplement doctor visits, unexpected happenings, and savings accounts. I would like more money working for me though. We may also be freeing up roughly $515/month after we pay my wife's car off later this year, if that helps.

I'm not trying to flex because I have lived borderline poverty prior to getting this new job that has allowed me this freedom. But, I come humbly for answers because I don't want to fuck this up. We have 2 kids and are just trying to build generational wealth at this point."
PSA: AVOID Vantage Point Armory Rail-Mounted compensators for handguns,guns,1i767wn,2025-01-22 02:59:15,0,0.3,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1i767wn/psa_avoid_vantage_point_armory_railmounted/,Old-Mammoth-2661,,"[Damaged slide due to poor and improper design](https://preview.redd.it/dlx89rus0iee1.jpg?width=1104&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dde0c305ed574a991b4f0ab232a4503173c85aa5)

I recently purchased a new sig M18 and decided to add a compensator. I didn't want to go the threaded barrel route due to laziness and cheapness (Something I would regret and end up doing anyway) so I decided to purchase one of those rail-mounted compensators from Vantage Point Armory.

I followed all of the install procedures carefully, and even watched the official video they posted on their youtube on how to install this specific rail-mounted comp on this specific firearm (Sig M18). There was no issue with installation and it was performed correctly

As you can see from the image above, when the firearm is discharged, most of the gasses are funneled through the compensator.

However the opening for the compensator is much larger than that of the barrel, meaning there is no seal between the barrel and compensator, this means that gasses are directed backwards toward the slide, damaging the paint!

Even worse, the compensator also funnels the dirty gas BACK INTO YOUR FIREARM (As you can see by the ocean of space above the barrel in the slide-hole), significantly increasing the wear and dirt of your firearm.

When properly installed, there is also an intentional gap between the slide and compensator (This is on their website, its designed so the comp doesn't interfere with the slide action).

This compounds with the first problem as gasses are now redirected to all sides around the compensator, further hindering performance and once again fouling your device.

Finally, after the weapon is fired, the slide action starts to rack the slide and barrel backwards (Due to browning design) while gasses are still escaping the barrel - so really only the first half of the shot is ""compensated"", the rest is just blown all over the place.

This is in addition to the flawed design of having a compensator connected to the weak polymer grip which is not designed for such forces, instead of the steel barrel

Worst of all, I left a review on their website a week ago highlighting legitimate criticisms - after explaining that the review must be reviewed first, my review has yet to publish a week later - so the seller seems to be a scammer on top of making mediocre products

I am trying to return this compensator which is more useful as a paperweight after paying return shipping fees (shady tactic) and filling out a weird pdf form that cannot be electronically submitted

I wasted my time and damaged my firearm, I hope others avoid this heartache

Mac DS 9 upgrades?,2011_Builders,1i6ua0k,2025-01-21 16:46:06,22,0.96,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6ua0k,steel_orn,," I purchased this gun without doing any research and I have to admit, I am pleasantly surprised. 
I found it on our local Utah Gun Exchange website for $700 dollars.  I purchased the gun from a nice old man who had run a couple mags through it. Having shot many 1911/2011 pistols including atlas, sti, staccato, I was impressed with the looks and the fact it had a bull barrel. Although I've shot many guns like this I was not familiar with their inner workings or operation. I took it home and the learning process began. 
I found the gun to be over sprung but that's an easy fix. The mag release was extremely hard to push. I had a weird issue when I would rack a round and eject the mag, there would be a loose round every time. Other than that, I did not have any issues with loose slide, or burrs on the end of the barrel like some people have mentioned. 
Like most people do, I started watching YouTube videos. I watched a ton of the Atlas Gun Works videos and found them to be very helpful. 
By the end of the first day owning the Mac ds9 I had completely polished everything within the gun. I polished the sear spring, the trigger, the slide, even things that didn't need polished. In addition I ordered a set of recoil springs from atlas, 12,13 & 14. I ordered a number 3 mag release spring, an extended mag release (has not arrived). Before the weekend I installed the holosun 507 comp and stream light TLR 1 HL which I'm pretty sure was a knock off although that was not my intention. 
My brother and I went out shooting with an array of weapons, as we do. When I got around to shooting this gun I was extremely impressed. I ran some hollow points through it, some 115 FMJs and a few others. I did not have one hiccup, the gun was extremely smooth and reliable for my 500+ rounds that day. My brother, who had been eyeing a staccato recently was so impressed, he is actively looking for his own MAC DS9. He wanted to know exactly what was done to the gun when he shot it to copy it when he gets his. I have plenty more ordered but here is the list of parts/upgrades to make your MAC DS9 a very capable, reliable and extremely smooth operating pistol. Prices are approximate.

AGW #12 recoil spring ($15)
AGW recoil buffer 3 pack ($10)
TLR 1 ($150)
Holusun 507 comp ($300)
Stippled grip (""free"" two hours of burning plastic)
Polishing hammer, sear spring, disconnect, slide with dremel and polishing pads/compounds ($100)
Minor bending of the sear spring for a lighter trigger (free)
Minor bending of extractor atlas has a great video on how to do this if needed. These are too strong from factory. This may have fixed the second round from being stripped as I have not had it happen since. 

Although the gun runs amazing, I have ordered a list of new parts to play around with and can give me review later. 

Extended mag release with large button ($50)

New safety with larger paddle on left side.

Main spring kit, just to see how light I can get this thing while maintaining reliability. 

Gas pedal slide release

AGW 11lb recoil spring

AGW Tool less guide rod. 

Thanks for reading, if you have questions on what or how to do anything I have mentioned in this post, I would love to share my amateur knowledge. Do not hesitate to purchase this gun if you are on the fence.

Gyit Gahd; A PSA on the things the game doesn't tell you,thefinals,1i5oek8,2025-01-20 06:46:07,115,0.96,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1i5oek8/gyit_gahd_a_psa_on_the_things_the_game_doesnt/,PeteZasHaus,Discussion,"As many of you know (and clearly at least as many don't) this game does not cover the minute by minute minutia of game strategy, effective gadget use, or roles. In a compounding effect this game has highly comparable similarities to other games in the genre. This has some pros and cons. On the pro side, the game is easy to pick up, as a lot of the natural instincts a player coming from another game would have apply to the new experience in it's free-format style. On the con side, old habits die hard, and what is new becomes compoundingly confused and leads to bad game sense and understanding without there being an opportunity. This post seeks to rectify that. I will discuss in an organized fashion what you need to know about the main game modes, and what instincts from other games are seeping in and negatively affecting your minute by minute decision-making.

To begin;
There is a TON of preconceptive contention about role and weapon efficacy. The big one is ironically the little guy. Lights.  

Contradictingly they are both considered OP and somehow ineffective. They've basically never had a solid foot in the comp meta (that business with the TA season doesn't... -doesn't count). I feel the main point of contention with them is definitely their role. High dps and kill count has people thinking they are carrying lobbies as light. In reality most lights do not play their role and are fully unincentivized to realize the truth. Your job as a light is not to get kills, and your insistence of that is a constant drag on your teams performance. 

Light has such a small health pool it's laughable. While it is a very effective, low skill-floor class for kills, as you move up ladder you will find yourself getting pancaked by people with decent aim and game sense. Lights ace performance stat is speed. They move twice as fast as the other classes and have the best mobility, escape, and trap specials/gadgets in the game. If more lights operated in recognition of that, they would have a solid place outside of the casual meta. 

Things to know as light; 
- Your job is to orbit, and stay out of sight. If you are caught lacking out in the open you are dead.
- You should not be engaging full health enemies all the way to zero by yourself. You are most effective in combat when you have damage support. Taking out a full healthbar for any class solo, light included, will usually put you in danger of becoming a statue too far away from your team for them to get you rezd safely.
- You should be flanking enemies that you know are about to be engaged by teammates or mid-fight. With their attention divided or solely focused on one enemy, they have no chance to survive.
- If you are seen, get the hell out of dodge, heal up, and get back in there. You heal to full quickly for a reason, just keep in mind where your teammates are engaging at all times, because there really is NO counter to effective flanking in this game.
- Disorient, Distract, Overcome.

The cool thing about this is that the only thing that needs to really change about how you would normally play being a kill hungry COD-transfer is positioning. You have all the tools necessary to know where your teammates and opponents are, learning to use them effectively will save you and your team a lot of headache. 

Now it's time to find a happy Medium. Mediums role is pocket. What has it gots in it's filthy little pocketses? You are the real rats in this game believe it or not. A hidden medium can suddenly and effectively engage to devastating effect. Take the specials and exclusive gadgets medium has into account.

- Team mobility tools which are best deployed from the front, and used from the back.

- Heal beam which can keep a teammate alive long enough to swap out to cover with you ready to engage and clean up.

- Demat which quite literally opens up a fight in ways that are fully to your advantage, and allows you and your team to expect and predict firelines and trap zones.

- Turrets which demand the division of enemy attention.

- Defibrillator which opens up a significant chunk of team health pool from disadvantage.

A note on defib and the biggest mistake mediums always make, although relevant to all revives; DONT REZ MID FIREFIGHT. Always move the statue and rez from cover.  The devs have tried a million different ways to teach players this, but they refuse to learn it, even now with defib at it's absolute minimal state. When you revive unsafely, it tells the enemy team where you are and where the newly rezd player is. You have effectively closed off your ability to adapt your environment. Instead of turning the fight to your favor you have all but ensured the outcome.

Now things are gonna get heavy. Heavy players generally know the assignment and get it done as best as their team allows. They are the tanks. Their job is to turn the corner first, fill space, and lead the engagement. The thing that generally nerfs a heavy's ability to be effective is a lack of teammates nearby. Without pocket mediums or good flankers to take advantage of the bullet sponge they can fall apart quickly. A hidden Heavy is useless, and similarly, one that has been left behind by their faster moving teammates cannot help turn a losing fight around. If a heavy loses their teammates, their options become heavily limited to the point of being wholly ineffective.

-Heavies should be at the front of the company. If a corner turns out to be a death trap, they have the health to retreat and allow the team a moment to reassess.

-While barricades and shields are decent mid-fight, they are even more effective at recovery. A pocket medium behind a retreated shield allows for pesky lights to get cleaned out very easily, and the fleas love to bite. With a pocket medium a light turning a corner to chase a damaged heavy will fall very quickly.

-Charge and slam is not good at escaping. It's best deployed as a surprised health chunker in a winning fight.

-Goo gun is for slowing down an approach or retreat. Goo in general is not effective for setup due to most teams having anti goo tools. A room filled with goo can be just as dangerous to your team as helpful, and most players know that.

-Winch claw has great offense, but don't forget it for setup. If you can restrict the enemies ability to hide during a steal you make it impossible for them to get the cashout without first garnering a teamwipe.

It's notable that all these roles have their exceptions. It's a creative game, and demands constant adaptability. So long as your core strategy recognizes your role, game sense will be learned and take over in alternative situations. 

There are plenty of YouTube videos on the individual gadgets and specializations, and they all have their effective use-cases. Pick your favorites and do your due diligence so you know what habits are worth practicing.

Now that we have covered classes and roles, let's cover the minute by minute minutia of the game. Starting with the number one thing everyone uses incorrectly in live matches. Tokens.

Being the one black contestant on the team does not give you plot armor. No no no I'm kidding please don't cancel.

Seriously though. Everyone is using their tokens like they are free. But they cost your team A LOT. A misused token is like taking a failure and going out of your way to make it worse.

-You are spawning 20s travel time from your team. It takes 30s from team wipe to respawn. Why are you wasting a precious limited resource to give your team a disadvantage?

-The cashout at the end of a match is worth 3 times as much as the one at the beginning. If you use a token AT ALL it should be to give your team money, not to save their lives. This isn't siege, we have unlimited lives. Don't token on the first cashout at all, and really think about it on the second.

-Stop hiding when you are the last player. It makes people think using a token is worth it. If you die quickly, at least we get to come back as a full group, and if you get a kill or two while doing it, that means less setup time for the enemy team. Bonus points for destroying mines or turrets during your suicide as it takes a lot of time for the enemy to replace those.

- If you manage to save all your tokens for the final round, you guys can spawn ad nauseum and keep the pressure high on the enemy team. It is almost impossible to use all your tokens when you have three or four in your pool.

-Nothing says war of attrition to your enemy in the final round like having one token each. If they know you are scared to respawn, or simply can't, they will abuse it, slapping you around like the chumps you are.

Now let's talk about the plug. Why are you wasting money on a guy who doesn't even know the grower?
Jokes aside there is key info you need to know about plugging in cashouts, and how you can effectively block teams in or out as a round builds up.

-Long engagements have no value. You get more just for putting the first cashbox in than you get for a full team wipe. Keep moving and if you feel stuck, grab statues and get out. 

-The only time it makes sense to double a cashout is the last two cash boxes. Otherwise even if you are the best team in the lobby, you are relying on winning what more or less amounts to a 3v9 with little to no breathing room. If it works out, you prolly got very lucky.

-If you are in second place or within $1000 after both cashboxes are doubled at the end of the match you are in the most dangerous position in the game.

-If you are in first place after both cashboxes are doubled at the end of the match you are guaranteed to qualify.

-If you are behind 2nd place by more than 22k at the end of the match, you NEED both cashouts in order to win. This is obviously easier to manage if they are doubled.

-If you are in second place at the end of a match, and 7k from placing a cashbox in won't put you in first, you NEED to get one cashbox to the other and prevent them from being taken to a cashout by any means necessary.

-Inversely, if 7k will put you in first, you don't even need to defend the cashout, you can leave and get the other cashbox. If you put it in yourself you make it far more likely that a worse team will qualify with you. But IF ANY OTHER TEAM places that box in, you will almost certainly lose.

As you can see, there is usually only one team that doesn't want the cashbox doubled at the end of the match, so usually, it will always get doubled unless second and third place are very close in score.


That's pretty much everything.
TLDR;

-Light is to be heard and not seen


-Medium is the real rats


-Heavy is to be seen and heard at all times.


-KD obsession loses matches


-Defibs and rez's should always be done from safety, not in danger


-An abandoned heavy is no good to you, keep them company


-Tokens are not free, you should save them as much as possible, it is almost always better to teamwipe than to waste a token.


-Pay close attention to your money, it's usually not hard to guarantee you qualify by knowing and doing the math.

"Algorai, providing additional utility for xUSD!",CompX,1i0hik9,2025-01-13 11:14:15,6,0.88,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompX/comments/1i0hik9/algorai_providing_additional_utility_for_xusd/,CompX-Initiative,,"Hi All,

*TL:DR - Algorai, a defi project running options vaults has added a GOLD$ bull vault that's funded with xUSD. Check them out and see if this vault, or any of their other ones, fit within your defi strategy. Also don't forget that we are incentivizing the* [PACT xUSD/USDC ](https://app.pact.fi/pool/1013729631?chart=Volume&period=D)*stable pool with xUSD interest revenue, so if you have stables sitting around, put them to work for you.*

We just want to shine a spotlight today on a project that is supporting xUSD by utilizing it in their platform. Algorai Finance is a [project ](http://docs.algorai.finance)that has brought option vaults to Algorand.  Users place tokens in a vault that will use a specific trading strategy over week long cycles.  These trading strategies are classified as a bull or bear strategy. There are several blue chip assets that have their own bull/bear strategies, such as Algo, goBTC and GOLD$ and more.

From a user perspective, you can decide if you think the price of the asset will increase or decrease over the next week. If you are betting that an asset will increase in value, you would add stablecoins to the bull vault for that asset, and if you think the asset will lose value you would place tokens from that asset in the bear vault.  Users should be aware of the strike price for their asset. For example, this week in the GOLD$ vault, a strike price of $81.4 has been chosen by the bull vault. As long as the asset ends on a price that's above $81.4, the vault will yield a net gain for the user. If the price falls below the strike price, there will be a net loss of tokens for the user due to the poor price action.

The decision which vault to add to is not a zero sum game. Strike prices are chosen so that both bull/bear vaults can succeed with each round. For example, GOLD$, bear and bull vaults have success rates over 90%. These success rates are clearly displayed for each vault in the Algorai UI.

Algorai vaults run for a week at a time. You can place tokens into the contract at any time, but they won't be used until the next round begins. After that, the tokens will be used to execute the desired trading strategy. Tokens can be called back at any time, though the user will have to wait until the end of the current round to actually access their principle + any potential gains. From one cycle to the next, any tokens in the contract will automatically be included in the next cycle, unless they've been called back by the user. This effectively compounds gains from week to week. Algorai takes fees from the gains that are made during any given cycle, meaning that if a loss is realized in some individual cycle, it doesn't take any fees.

At CompX we're celebrating the fact that xUSD has been selected as the stablecoin for the GOLD$ bull vault. This means that users can deposit xUSD into the contract and potentially access gains that Algorai creates by enacting the bull trading strategy. The vault has been active for 13 rounds, with 12 of them finishing in profit. Based on current performance, the vault is projecting a 9.45% APY yield, which is sustainable because it's not built on rewards payouts but on real on-chain trading profits. Use of xUSD increases demand, trading volume and brings additional utility to the token and we're very happy they've selected it. Currently the GOLD$ bull vault currently has over 55 thousand xUSD tokens deposited, generating profit. We hope you guys will take a second to check out Algorai. Check out the GOLD$ vault along with their other vaults to see if what they're offering fits into your long term defi strategy. We want innovative projects to be successful on Algorand, and supporting them and generating revenue happens when you use their vaults to make money for yourself. If their project is in your preferred risk profile, check them out!

Increased use of xUSD is great, but we're still going to rely on our community to participate in the project by providing liquidity. In the age of swap routers, all liquidity is good liquidity and we're grateful for EVERYONE that provides xUSD liquidity on the dexes. That being said, we are currently pushing liquidity depth in our [PACT stable pool ](https://app.pact.fi/pool/1013729631?chart=Volume&period=D)by continuing to divert a portion of our xUSD revenue to build liquidity in that pool, which is the core of our liquidity in transaction volume and support to the rest of the ecosystem. All users have to do is place liquidity in that pool, and stake those LP tokens at CompX to get their cut of that xUSD interest. Currently, the calculated APY for the stablecoin LP staking is around 12%. Help us build a native, decentralized stable that by Algorand, for Algorand.

Thanks for the read, and stay safe out there."

Idk I don't sleep) so I'm posting the Saturday women's matches first and will update the rest in another post.  Dont forget to join the bracket and odds comps!  

# Sabalenka vs Stephens :

Aryna Sabalenka was up against an extremely difficult challenge in the finals in Brisbane and she still won. Polina Kudermetova was serving well, and hitting every shot with full conviction. She rattled off three games from a break down to win the first set, but somehow it still didn’t shift the momentum. Sabalenka hits the ball too hard. If she gets frustrated or starts missing because of wind issues she can donate sets, but winning the entire match against her takes something special. You have to be able to reflect power incredibly well, defend admirably, or somehow rush or move her. It’s basic tennis strategy to do those things, but it just felt like if Sabalenka kept hitting the court, her weight of shot would get her the title.

Sabalenka is set up here to make another solid run at the AO title. The court conditions are good for her, she’s comfortable, and she’s coming in on a hot streak. Sloane is a good shout to put up a competitive fight because she hits bigger than most of the WTA, but the days of her being a threat for titles and big upsets are mostly over. Sabalenka in 2.

# Kartal vs Bouzas Maneiro :

This is a very interesting one. Bouzas Maneiro has turned in some really high level upsets, but a lot of middling losses. She defeated Sakkari and Krejcikova and several other good names last season, but she also lost to players right around Kartal’s level. Kartal was mostly competing at the smaller events, but she had a tremendous season, including winning her first WTA Title in Monastir and 3 ITF level events. This should be a good battle. Kartal has a massive forehand and a decent serve, but Bouzas is a great defender and has good variety when she gets inside the baseline. Bouzas having played a few more warmup matches may give her a good shot here, but I tend to think of her as thriving when her opponent is making errors and I’m not sure why I’d be assuming Kartal will do that. It’s pretty obvious Kartal works really hard on her fitness, so I’d guess this offseason has been productive. Kartal in 3.

# Pera vs Maria :

Pretty cool matchup here. Pera has an excellent forehand with time, and Maria gives you something that sort of resembles time. Tatjana Maria slices almost 90% of her shots, and it is a challenge that many players on tour have folded against. Pera has the weight of shot, and as a lefty you somehow are more used to dealing with the backhand slices, so I think she can get through. At the same time, Pera’s losses are very regularly because of unforced errors, so this could easily go the distance. Pera in 2-3.

# Tauson vs Noskova :

I guess we like Tauson here? When the prediction is tough, we’re a team btw. I really loved the level Noskova showed against Todoni a week or so ago, but then she had a rough go of it against Andreeva. She has the offensive power and flat hitting to really thrive on these courts, but struggling for consistency is a scary thing. Tauson just won the title in Auckland, and her run to get there included wins against Keys, Kenin, and an in-form Montgomery. The forfeit in the finals against Osaka wasn’t ideal, but Tauson is playing better than Noskova heading into this battle. I don’t honestly see how either player can defend against the other. They both hit a bit huge and their only real weakness is their lateral speed, so this doesn’t have to go to the way their early seasons have been progressing. I like Tauson because I think she’s more likely to lock into a level and remain there as she did in Auckland. Noskova has the game to beat anyone and she might even normally be favored here, but the loss to Andreeva and Sakkari will have her slightly less than 100% about her decision-making, and points in this match will likely go quick. Tauson in 2-3.

# Frech vs Kudermetova P. :

The P. is for Put some respect on her name. Polina Kudermetova was grinding away in ITF and Challenger events for a few seasons now, and at the age of 21 she’s made her first final on tour. When she wins, it’s all about remaining steady. She can rally for days when she’s focused, and her serve has improved a bit during the offseason. The main difference in Brisbane is that she hit the ball really hard and was full commitment whenever she had the chance on offense. Defeating Samsonova, Kasatkina, and Wang Xinyu in one event is excellent, and she also took a set off Sabalenka and this is all after coming through qualifying.

Polina also qualified here at the AO, and the stretch of excellent play is starting to look LIKE IT WILL NEVER END, he said, jinxing her. Frech probably isn’t the household name she once was, but she has defeated Polina in both previous meetings. Those were a while back, but these two have similar styles and Frech’s ability to redirect power and make the extra get are valuable against Kudermetova. I’d expect a lot of people to pile in supporting Kudermetova’s side, and for them to have to endure a very long day at the office. Frech is solid, and I think this goes the distance or includes tiebreakers. When someone you know how to beat/have had success against goes on a run, it almost incentivizes you to defeat them because they have that buzz, that elder wand status at the moment. I think Kudermetova is playing great but there’s half a target on her back now as the new young phenom. At the end of the day, I think Kudermetova’s strokes are more reliable and create more power, so I’ll lean towards her. Kudermetova in 3.

# Saville vs Blinkova :

These two played in Hobart 2024, with Saville winning in three. Daria is likely to have even more support at the AO, so this will be uphill for Blinkova. So far this season, she’s been off but Saville has been a little worse. Saville’s forehand might be the biggest shot on the court, but Blinkova’s weight of shot is bigger consistently, so if I didn’t see the Hobart result, I’d like her side of this. Blinkova in 3.

# Uchijima vs Linette :

Linette crashed out pretty quick last week against Maya Joint, but the young Australian really played some solid tennis. I like Linette to rebound here, and she’s leading the h2h 3-0 against Uchijima. Uchijima tends to thrive against players she hits bigger than, and her and Linette are pretty evenly matched. Linette has more offensive capabilities and a better serve, and that’s what’s propelled her through in the past. The one bright point is that each match has gotten closer, and Uchijima did win a set in Beijing. Perhaps she finally reverses the trend? I still like Linette in 3.

# Bouzkova vs Andreeva :

Both these players are playing well right now, so this should be another close match. This draw is similar to the ATP side in that a lot of similar players are competing. The biggest difference I see here is in their forehand. Andreeva can lose depth at times going crosscourt but she hits harder off that wing than Bouzkova, who tends to do most of the work with her legs and her backhand. Andreeva is probably the better server as well, but Bouzkova in good form can make life difficult on anyone so this will be a tough mental test for Andreeva. Andreeva in 2.

# Shnaider vs Cocciaretto :

There are high expectations hanging over Shnaider this year. Last season she finished at number 13 in the rankings, and she has 4 titles already on tour. Her consistency and her huge lefty forehand make her a really tough player to play, and her skill is incredible as well, as showcased in her Silver medal in the doubles at the Olympics (with Mirra Andreeva). Shnaider is great, and the wins should continue. Cocciaretto has the serve and power to score on Shnaider, but maybe not the defensive abilities. Shnaider in 2.

# Tomljanovic vs Krueger :

This will be one of the best matches of the day, in a tournament where the majority of the matches are close and players are playing near their best tennis. Ashlyn Krueger is like Samsonova, Sabalenka, and Rybakina all rolled into one. She can really spray errors at times and has struggled to bring her best game to an entire match, but there’s been a big shift this year where she’s able to play well in deciding sets. That’s a huge step for a power player and it also means victories, because the way she’s able to hit the ball can do serious damage against tired legs. It’ll be interesting to see how she stacks up against Tomljanovic, who isn’t quite back to her best self yet but is hinting at arriving there soon. Ajla crushes the ball and has found some very good results at major events by just staying steady. With Krueger coming off a few good weeks already, she should win but those lapses can be tricky since Ajla isn’t really looking to make errors and is one of the few that can match Krueger’s power. Krueger in 2-3.

# Vondrousova vs Fett :

Vondrousova is injured again. She left the court in tears in Adelaide, and so this is really not a simple match to analyze. Fett has big power in her forehand, but she’s a level below Marketa. If Vondrousova is okay, I think she rolls here. If she’s injured at all, I don’t actually expect her to take the court. She has major titles to her name already and is still pretty early in her career to be risking compounding an injury. Vondrousova in 2.

# Parry vs Vekic :

Vekic lost her last two tour level matches to Putintseva, and that’s not entirely unexpected. Here, she’s favored to beat Diane Parry, but I’m not sure it’ll be so simple. Parry can definitely struggle on hardcourt, but she beat Vekic in 3 last time they played, and Vekic has lost her last four matches. Parry hasn’t played yet this season, so she might not start out so sharp, but that seems like a big assumption to make. I’m a Parry fan, so I think this will be close. The warmup matches do count though, so Donna has a good shot here to level the h2h. Vekic in 3.

# Pavlyuchenkova vs Yuan :

Yuan is generally a good strong baseliner, so seeing her struggle to maintain a consistent level on tour is a little puzzling. Pavlyuchenkova is a tough matchup for her because both hit the ball hard and don’t really like to move off the baseline. Normally I’d like Pavs her because she serves a bit more efficiently than Yuan but she didn’t play since the US Open last season and I didn’t catch her opening match against Vondrousova. I’m a little blind here, but I think Yuan has a lot more to play for and she’s played 4 times as much tennis this month. Yuan in 3.

# Zidansek vs Potapova :

Zidansek may have fallen off in the past few seasons, but her forehand is still brilliant. She was able to navigate through qualifying and now plays a big name who’s not in the best spirits. Potapova did a lot of shouting and racquet swiping during the loss against Birrell, and Zidansek did take her to a deciding set in all their previous meetings, actually taking the most recent match in Monastir in 2022. I think Potapova being such a big hitter means she needs a quick start to really let loose, and the errors that fly when sets are close seem to trigger more to arrive. It’s something for her team to work on, or not. This I think will be close. Zidansek shouldn’t be able to win, but she’s done well in the past. Potapova in 3.

# Siegemund vs Baptiste :

This is gonna beeeeee so goooooood. Baptiste has huge power and a great serve, and she’s starting to really compete well on tour. Siegemund has seemed like the tricky veteran out there for her entire career, and she still has the ability to frustrate opponents with her tenacious defending. I like Baptiste’s chances here because she just had a great little run in Auckland, but she has some losses against baseliners that show she can still be dragged into marathons and defeated. This is really tough to call. Baptiste is the obvious pick but Siegemund served 69% first serves in against Bencic in her loss and she’s the exact type of player who can frustrate Baptiste into errors. Baptiste should get through here, I just think it may take 3 sets.

# Zheng vs Todoni :

A.A. Todoni is probably one of the best WTA prospects to appear in a very long time. People might call me crazy or say I’m asking too much, but her game is big enough to compete for majors. She’s a solid athlete and moves extremely well for her height (6’0”). She hits the fuzz off the ball and competes well, and with a clay background she’s already fairly consistent from the baseline.  The match her and Noskova played was such high level hitting that it made me think Noskova could beat Andreeva (she could not), and while Todoni is not there yet, I think this is a match you really want to tune into. What I liked from the Noskova loss is that Todoni was willing to go shot for shot even while down in the scoreline. The scoreline never affected her aggression or belief, and that’s big because going all out while you’re losing is how you can find the next level quickest. She had a great run through qualifying, beating Lepchenko and Jimenez Kasintseva, and while Zheng is likely too large of an ask, it’ll be exciting tennis.

Zheng not having any warmup matches makes me think this could be tricky, but the odds are she’s training well during the offseason, so Zheng in 2. Todoni can hit with her, but ending the points will be tricky and Zheng’s serving will be a big boost.

Recipe Analysis: 2024 AHA National Homebrew Competition Winners,mead,1hynmif,2025-01-10 23:05:57,21,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/1hynmif/recipe_analysis_2024_aha_national_homebrew/,weirdomel,Discussion,"The [January/February 2025 issue of Zymurgy](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/zymurgy-magazine/january-february-2025/) came out recently, and it contains recipes for the winners of (nearly) every category of the competition.  I have done a write-up on the past two years of competition winner recipes ([2022 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/x5o93l/nhc_winning_mead_recipes_in_septoct_2022_zymurgy/), [2023 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/160690r/recipe_analysis_2023_aha_national_homebrew/)) as well, and continue the tradition here.  Watching competitions in this way is one avenue that I find useful for drawing inspiration, observing trends, and generally thinking about my own process by observing how others have been successful with their own.

The AHA website gives members access to back medal-winning recipes going back decades, and it is interesting to see how methods have changed even in the past couple of decades.  I would love to see more mead content in Zymurgy outside of this competition installment.

While entries below contain lists of ingredients and my own commentary, I will not be reproducing the notes that accompany each in the article.  Folks will need to read the actual article for that.

# M1A Dry Mead - Bill Boyer, ""Sir Galahad the Pure - Blueberry Blossom - Petillant""

5 gallon (18.9L) batch

* 10 lb (4.54kg) blueberry blossom honey
* 1lb (454g) blueberry blossom honey to backsweeten
* 10g Red Star Cote des Blancs yeast
* Potassium Sorbate and Potassium metabisulfite to stabilize
* Sparkolloid to clarify
* Yeast nutrient
* Petillant carbonation

WM Comments

* My favorite calculator puts this at 1.072 OG, and around 9% ABV.  The winner in the M1 category last year was about the same, toward the lighter side of the ""standard"" strength category.
* I want to call out to things about the backsweetening honey.  First, it's there.  As Mr. Boyer calls out in his process notes, dry does not mean a complete lack of sweetness.  Second, the process notes also mention heating the backsweetening honey, which I interpret to be in order to help blending.
* Process notes also call out that this was a split batch: one was left still, the other petillant.  Both were entered to competitions, and Mr. Boyer saw the petillant version consistently performing better.  For those who are indecisive about which meads to send to comps, and have the resources to do so, splitting a batch and sending both is a great way to learn about what adjustments work vs. don't in the eyes of judges.  

# M1B Semi-sweet Mead - Terry Fast, ""Mead Me""

5 gallon (18.9L) batch

* 5 lb (2.27kg) orange blossom honey
* 2.25lb (1.02kg) orange blossom honey to backsweeten
* 5g D47
* 4g wine tannin
* 6g Fermaid O
* 3g malic acid
* Sorbate and Sulfite to stabilize
* Sparkolloid to clarify
* Carbonated

WM Comments

* Something is screwy with the 6.5% ABV quoted in the article.  With my favorite calculator, this recipe should come in at 1.035 and 4.9% ABV before backsweetening.
* The process notes mention using distilled water, which is often discouraged in this sub.

# M1C Sweet Mead - Garrett Freeman, ""Sweet Clover Traditional Mead""

Well done, u/ManMadeMead! 

1 gallon (3.79L) batch

* 1.3lb (590g) sweet clover honey
* 12oz (340g) sweet clover honey for backsweetening
* 2g US-05
* 2.5g Fermaid-O
* 1g wine tannin
* Malic and Citric acid to taste
* Carbonated

WM Comments

* I love every time a hydromel wins M1C.  I'm sure this mead was against some very delicious big, bold sweet meads, especially looking at who the silver and bronze medals went to in the category.
* Mr. Freeman's process notes mention either chemical stabilization or pasteurization.  The phrasing of the write-up suggests pasteurizing \*before\* backsweetening is an option, which I would point out as potentially problematic and inviting re-fermentation.  I'm also really curious whether the medal-winning batch was stabilized or pasteurized, considering pasteurization's often-discussed impacts on flavor and aroma profile.

# M2A Cyser - Michael Wilcox, ""No Cinnamon Added""

Batch size not specified

* McIntosh apple juice
* Clover Blossom Honey with obvious cinnamon aroma notes, added to 1.080 OG
* Red Star Cotes des Blancs yeast - or - DV10 yeast.
* Yeast nutrients, with amount halved to account for YAN in fruit
* Carbonated

WM Comments

* This recipe also won the equivalent of Mead BOS at this comp.  For those who don't recognize his name, Mr. Wilcox wins medals at NHC with remarkable dependability in the mead or especially the cider categories.  It is evident he knows what he is doing, and that he has expertise in working with less-common techniques.  With that said...
* The process notes indicate lowering batch temperature to halt Cotes des Blancs fermenting at 1.020.  Mr. Wilcox comments ""you can usually stop it...""
* Per the notes, this was a blended batch: one with Cote des Blancs that was halted, plus another with DV10 that fermented dry and was backsweetened to the same level.
* If going by the ""a mead has to be at least 51% honey"" saying that is often repeated in this sub, this might not be a mead.  Unless the apple juice used by Mr. Wilcox has an SG of 1.040 or below, which would be on the low side of typical as far as I can tell, then adding honey to 1.080 would mean more of the fermentable sugar comes from the apples than the honey.  Of course, BJCP guidelines do not prescribe required percentages, and Mr. Wilcox's competition record indicates that he is capable of making liquids that judges perceive as being exceptional-quality meads.

# M2B Pyment - Dan Acheson, ""A Witty Reference to Monty Python""

6 gal (22.7L) batch

* 2.11gal (6L) German Gewurtztraminer Wine Concentrate Kit
* 10lb (4.54kg) Lehua blossom honey
* 18g BA11 
* GoFerm
* 51.4g Fermaid O following TOSNA 3.0 protocol
* 1/2 spiral French oak, light toast.  
* Carbonated

WM Comments

* Yay for wine kit juiceomels winning medals!
* ...but according to my calculator, the honey only contributes 59 gravity points, while the wine kit contributes 91.  ""iTs NoT a MeAd!!!""
* Process notes indicate that the batch only aged on the spiral for 7 days, a fraction of the 6 weeks typically needed for full extraction.  Good use of oak for adding tannin structure but not much oak flavor.  It makes me want to compare e.g. a spiral for 7 days, vs 1/6th of a spiral for 6 weeks. 

# M2C Berry Mead - Steve Fletty, ""Chateau Fletty Framboise""

5 gal batch

* 12lb. (5.44kg) [Marmeleiro blossom honey](https://beeseasonal.com/blogs/every-honey-tells-a-story/marmeleiro-brazilian-quince-honey)
* 1.75lb (790g) Marmeleiro honey to backsweeten
* 10lb. (4.54kg) raspberries
* 8g [Enoferm Syrah](https://morewinemaking.com/products/syrah-dry-wine-yeast.html) yeast
* 8g Fermaid K
* 4g DAP
* Sorbates and Sulfites to stabilize
* Carbonated

WM Comments

* Mr. Fletty is also remarkably accomplished mead maker, having won AHA MMotY multiple times across decades.  At time of this writing, he is the current front-runner for the [AMMA NMMotY](https://mead-makers.org/national-mead-maker-of-the-year/) circuit.  
* He won the ""Traditional Mead"" category at this competition in 2023 with a semi-sweet Marmeleiro honey mead.  I wouldn't be surprised if this came from the same bucket...  If you find a honey that judges like, buy it and use it!
* I vaguely recall a [chop-and-brew episode](https://chopandbrew.com/tag/steve-fletty/) where Mr. Fletty describes adding his nutrients all up front at pitch, and then focuses on temperature control in his cool basement.  Not the SNA approaches shown by other competitors, but it obviously works for him. 

# M2E Melomel - Kyle Ducharme, ""VT HoD""

Way to go, u/ssjmerfolk!

5 gallon batch

* 20 lb (9.07kg) Mexican Orange blossom honey.  Bee Seasonal?
* 17 lb (7.71kg) Morello cherries
* 15lb (6.8kg) red raspberries
* 4lb (1.81kg) black currants
* 15g 71B
* 2oz (57g) medium toast hungarian oak cubes
* [Opti-Red](https://scottlab.com/opti-red-yeast-derivative-nutrient-optired)
* Lallzyme EX-V
* GoFerm and Fermaid O following TOSNA, at half the recommended amount on account of fruit.  
* Sulfites and sorbates to stabiliize

WM Comments

* Mr. Ducharme's take on [The Heart of Darkness](https://www.schrammsmead.com/meads/the-heart-of-darkness/) medals at this comp just two years after Matt Mead's [""Ode to HOD"" two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/x5o93l/nhc_winning_mead_recipes_in_septoct_2022_zymurgy/) in the same category.  If you can pull it off, this fruit combination is a judge-pleaser.  
* Only 8 months old at the time it was judged!  Obvious evidence that if your process is sound, you can win top-tier medals without needing to wait too long. And this makes me almost afraid to enter the melomel category at any major comp for a while, if Mr. Ducharme is sending bottles that might even get better with age. 
* In his process notes, Mr. Ducharme emphasizes ""source the best honey and fruit that you can buy!"" which is sound advice.  Though it does contrast with folks this year and last year medaling with juiceomels and wine kit pyments. Meadmaker skill certainly factors in. 

# M2D Stone Fruit Mead - Steve Fletty, ""Chateau Fletty Cherry Tupelo""

5 gal batch 

* 8lb (3.63kg) tupelo blossom honey
* 1.25lb (570g) tupelo blossom honey to backsweeten
* 8lb (3.63kg) tart cherries
* 8g Rhone 4600
* 6g Fermaid K
* 3g DAP
* Sorbates and sulfites to stablize
* Carbonated

WM Commentary

* Not sure what more to say on this one.  Looking across Mr. Fletty's from the recipes from this year and the past few years, the simplicity and common threads are obvious.  Deliberate honey choice; slightly uncommon yeast; apparently elegant process.  

# M3A Fruit & Spice Mead - Bill Boyer, ""Whizzo Chocolates""

6 gal batch

* 10lb (4.54kg) Costco wildflower honey
* 2.11 gal (8L) [Apres Chocolate Raspberry Dessert Wine Kit](https://labelpeelers.com/wine-making/wine-kits/apres-premium/limited-release-apres-chocolate-raspberry-dessert-wine-kit/)
* 10g EC-1118
* Yeast Nutrient
* Dual-Fine 

WM Commentary

* Costco honey winning an AHA medal out of a field of 23 entries in what is arguably one of the more challenging categories.  Well done!  Not specified whether it was the organic or the plain stuff. 
* I love that Mr. Boyer's process notes call out must aeration and temperature control.  Notably he mentions not rehydrating his yeast. 

# M3B Spice Herb or Vegetable Mead - LaVaughn Barker, ""Grandma's Recipe""

6 gal batch

* 18lb. (8.16kg) orange blossom honey
* Backsweetening honey to taste
* 2lb tsedo ([Rhamnus staddo](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/718680-1))
* 2g FT Blanc Soft tannin
* 2g Opti-White
* Wild yeast (!)

WM Commentary

* Until the day I read this article, I was not aware of tsedo.  It sounds really interesting.  Note that tsedo (*Rhamnus staddo*) is distinct from the gesho (*Rhamnus prinoides*) that many mead makers in the US have heard about.  
* Absolutely awesome to see a wild ferment win gold at NHC, in a category as competitive as M3B.  Mr. Barker's process notes mention something of a punch-down process to keep the tsedo wet and saturated.  The wild ferment, augmented with optiwhite and FT Blanc, is a wonderful combination of an apparent family recipe with modern technique. 
* I can't help notice Mr. Barker put this entry (and was extremely successful) in category M3B, instead of the unfortunately-named M4B ""Historical Meads"" or M4C ""Experimental Meads"".  M4B guidelines expressly include ""indigenous styles"" while M4C expressly includes ""non-traditional yeasts"".  His process notes do mention clearing his entry, instead of sweetening and serving while cloudy as he notes is sometimes done.  To me this indicates a clear awareness of how BJCP mead categories heavily lean on the BJCP Standard Description for mead which insists on clarity.  It also suggests to me that the BJCP use of the terms ""historical"" and ""experimental"" and ""non-traditional"" could use some reconsideration. 

# M4A Braggot - Benjamin Frymark, Doug Brown, Jenny Chua-Tuan, ""Flaming Globes of Sigmund""

Ok, I don't know how to type this one up without the brewing process notes, and I can't do that.  Check out r/Homebrewing for more info on beer brewing terminology.  This entry was blended *at bottling* among a batch of cream ale, and a batch of dry mead. 

* Cream ale: 5.5 gal batch (21L)
   * Mash: 1.81kg Muntons Pale Planet malt, 1.81kg Weyerman Extra Pale Pilsner malt, 1.25kg flaked maize
   * Hops: 7g Cashmere @ 90 min, 14g Cashmere @ 5 min
   * US-05
* Mead: 2 gallon batch (7.6L)
   * 5lb (2.27kg) wildflower honey
   * Florida Orange Blossom honey to backsweeten to taste
   * 5g Red Star Premier Cuvee
   * Fermaid O following TOSNA
   * Sorbate and Sulfite to stabilize
   * Wine tannin and acid blend to taste
* Carbonated

WM Commentary

* Blending at bottling is one of the most underrated techniques for getting good entries into a competition.  If you are ""the mead person"" in your local homebrew club, consider asking your beer-centric colleagues for a growler of their brew to blend into a braggot.  It is \*so\* much fun, and can lead to medals for both of you.  
* One more for the ""Meads must be 51% honey"" crowd to grab pitchforks on, in this comp.  The beer was 5.5 gallons @ 1.047, and the mead was 2 gal @ 1.075 OG, and blended about 2:1 per the process notes, meaning more total fermentable sugars may have came from the malt than the honey, even factoring in the FG of the beer portion.  
* I'm by far an expert on braggots, as much as I enjoy lurking in r/braggot.  In my experience, M4A is usually won by entries that are based on higher-ABV beer styles.  To see a cream ale blended with a polyfloral+OB plain mead win gold at NHC is \*chef's kiss\* on par with the last time a light lager won BOS.   

# M4B Historical Mead - Bill Boyer, ""Trojniak vs. Montmorency vs. Cherry vs. Matthew Mead""

No recipe available.  Drat.  

WM Commentary

* I am sure Mr. Boyer makes a killer Polish-style mead.  For those who would like to learn more about the style, check out [this remarkable series](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/11izkla/translating_old_school_polish_recipes_many_many/) of posts. 

# M4C Experimental Mead - Garret Freeman, ""Blueberry Muffin Mead""

u/ManMadeMead strikes again!

1 gal batch 

* 2lb (907g) honey
* 2lb (907g) blueberries
* 2g 71B
* Pectic enzyme
* 2.5g Fermaid O
* 0.5g wine tannin
* Sorbate and Sulfites to stabilize
* 0.5oz (14g) cake batter flavor
* 0.25 tsp malic acid
* 0.25 tsp citric acid
* 113g maple syrup to backsweeten
* 227g honey to backsweeten
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 0.25 tsp vanilla extract
* Carbonated

WM notes

* I love comp winners who publish their recipes.  I absolutely adore comp winners who [make videos about their winning recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOksaO6ko8). 
* Mr. Freeman again suggests pasteurization as a possibility, and does it at a more logical point in the process notes for this recipe.  
* I know folks in this sub have [mixed feelings on store-bought flavorings](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/161amz5/what_portion_do_you_have_to_craft_personally_to/), but they are certainly here to stay on the competition circuit.  I would love to try the extract mentioned in this recipe, and see how well it stands in for ""general baked goods"" flavor in a mead. 

# Overall WM Notes and Take-Aways

* A really fun mix of process styles overall.  Also a fun mix of lower-in-bracket ABV meads, compared to 14%+ fruit bombs.  
* LOTS of carbonation among the medal winners.  In a competitive table, what better way to get judges to notice aroma compounds than to jam them up their noses.  But judges becoming accustom to that puts homebrewers who lack means to force carbonate (due to space, economics, or a variety of factors) at somewhat of a disadvantage, and I think that's worth talking about. 
* Yeast pitch rates hover around 0.5g/l for most of these recipes.  Take that for whatever it might be worth.  Lots of SNA, and one or two mentions of oxygenation/aeration, but some notable mentions of not rehydrating.  
* I was really shocked not to see any mention of tartaric acid in recipes that did mention acid adjustments.  Maybe coincidence, or maybe folks sticking closer to the acid profiles of the fruits that they are using in their meads. 
* Both Mead BOS and Cider BOS went to Michael Wilcox.  If you are at all interested in ciders, his page-long write-up on his BOS-winning French cider in this issue is worth a detour.  

If you are still reading this far, thank you, and I would really love to hear your reactions or thoughts!"
Feats of strength & Attakan,ZeriMains,1hx7ewm,2025-01-09 02:17:34,5,0.78,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeriMains/comments/1hx7ewm/feats_of_strength_attakan/,HuesOfSolitude,Discussion,"How do we feel about the new feats of strength? I'm feeling negative, but I'd love some input!

I'm a little concerned. Feats of strength heavily favours champions with early game agency, and Zeri has some of the worst agency in bot lane at the moment pre 15. The new tier three boots all come with a rather substantial boost to movement speed (+5 for most, and +10 & +4% for swifties). 

I am not high elo, but I feel that Zeri is can struggle with her short range and low movement speed outside of E. The gutting of movement speed across other classes has been amazing, only for them to immediately add this movement speed back into a now snowball favouring system.

Due to this I am worried that for majority of games, we will be slower than the opponent due to not being able to contest feats of strength which will result in her current range issues being compounded. 

Atakan is another concern. This feels like a system that heavily rewards team comps with early game power, and encourages fighting. Zeri may further suffer to aggressive opponents, pushed further behind than ever before due to the snowballing nature of these features.

As a solo queue player I am dreading losing feats to my top laner feeding at 3 minutes, but I digress. I'm keen to hear how everyone stands on these new changes! What do we think about Feats and Atakan? "
"Feeling stuck? In 2025, take a risk.",drums,1hwnado,2025-01-08 10:52:06,23,0.96,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/1hwnado/feeling_stuck_in_2025_take_a_risk/,call_me_gary,Discussion,"Hi all! Seeing as it's the new year and we all have resolutions and such... I thought I'd share a quick story and encourage anyone that's in a rut on the drums. My suggestion is to freak yourself out this year. Try to do something that makes you nervous. Here's my story from 2024.

Quick background, I'm 39 and have been playing since 6th grade. I did the rudimental/corps-style thing in high school and early college, and taught lots of lessons and played with tons of rock, pop, church, etc bands when I was in my 20's. Now I'm a husband, father of four, and financial advisor by day, with not tons of free time and no room to have drums set up in my house (my '64 blue sparkle Ludwigs sit in their cases in my closet!). As far as clout, social media presence, or whatever goes, I am a musical nobody with no platform. But I love everything about the drums and always have.

I have been at the place for a long time where I can sit in with any bar band/church worship team/cover band for any popular music styles and execute just fine, and probably get a compliment or two. I suppose many of you are in the same boat. However, I'm also perpetually unhappy with my playing since I don't have the ability to practice a ton (outside of “maintenance” practice on my Prologix pad).

But since I started playing drum set, the one form of music that I've never played live has been any form of jazz. Partly because of lack of opportunities, but partly because I’m very nervous. I took lessons on jazz drums, I listen to jazz every day… but never have had the chance to play live. But it's my favorite kind of music, and my favorite kind of drumming. Showing up to the local jazz jam seemed like it could just go very wrong and I honestly didn’t want to embarrass myself - again, I’m 39 and don’t have tons of free time, so the idea of sitting down with a bunch of strangers and proving I’m the squarest square in the room sounded low-grade humiliating. Transparently, I do not have that kind of confidence.

Fast forward to last January where a buddy of mine asked if I’d be interested in sitting in for a few gigs with a 17-pc big band (!). I didn’t know anyone in the band, but they are a solid, busy, working band that plays a lot of standards and a couple of original pieces. Even considering my above restrictions on practice time, it felt like the opportunity to finally try to play a form of music I love and challenge myself, while also growing musically. So I said yes. And immediately started feeling anxious about committing. What if I sucked? What if I embarrassed myself? I don't even have the time to workshop a lot of these tunes, though I can sight read a chart. Exactly how bad was this going to go?

Compounding that, I assumed I’d get a month or two of practice to learn some of the songs. But the bandleader told me (after I committed) that they don’t typically practice, and the first gig that was lined up was a dance night where the band played from 7 PM  to 11 PM (that is a lot of  music!) They gave me the charts the *night before* the gig, I worked the next day, and then showed up to meet everybody and get set up. I was excited and terrified, but mostly terrified. Probably 30 songs on the set list, with a band I’ve never played with, in a style of music I’m completely new at. I was going to sight read big band charts for four hours. Baptism by fire, to say the least.

But guess what? I did it. It wasn't perfect, I missed a few cues, but I kept time, kept it simple, and avoided any train wrecks. And for the first time in a long time, I felt myself “leveling up” multiple times in my musicality during the gig. The entire night, my internal drum commentary mind was working overdrive - “Oh ok, the trumpets dragged that section last time, better play at the front of the pocket and drive them next time. Ok, that tenor sax is a hard blower, make sure to give him some meat to solo over when he’s feeling it. Ah, this feels too busy - you are comp’ing way too much during this song, quit trying to convince everyone you have a solid left hand and just play good time”, and so on, and so on. It was an absolute rush. One of my favorite things about the drums is that there's always a way to play better, smoother, groovier, more dynamically, etc... and all night I'm taking mental notes on new ways I can improve as a musician.

I played competently enough to get invited back and am now the go-to sub for the band, which I'm really enjoying. It was not on my bingo card in this season of life to take this risk and play this music, but I'm having a ball learning and getting better every time I play. I was introduced to a new musician by our bandleader at the last gig as ""one of our solid big band drummers"" and had to pinch myself... I'm not playing at the Lincoln Center, I'm not on youtube, and nobody has heard of me (rightfully so). But I guess I am by definition a working jazz drummer now, and I'm so happy I took the chance.

**All this to say... in 2025, if you're feeling a bit stuck, and you suffer with confidence issues like I do... take the challenging gig, study with the new teacher, show up to the jam, do whatever it takes. You might be better than you think, and you will certainly grow from the experience. Happy drumming!**"

In short, despite all the hand wringing about an imminent recession at the beginning of the year, our household net worth increased by $547k (i.e., from $960k to $1.507mm) in 2024, a \~57% increase.

This consists of (i) assets of (x) \~$1.77mm equity index funds, mostly S&P500 (zero bonds) about evenly split between post-tax and tax-advantaged (pre-tax 401ks, MBDR 401ks, 529s, Roth IRAs, etc.), and (y) $40k operating cash (evenly split between checking and high yield savings), *minus* (ii) liabilities of (x) student loans totaling $287k and (y) general operating credit cards totaling around $15k (generally paid off monthly). More detailed below:

* $40k operating cash/emergency fund
* $1.77mm equity index funds, consisting of""
   * $782k in 401ks/similar (including mega backdoor Roth contributions and one legacy Roth IRA spouse has)
   * $609k in taxable brokerages
   * $219k in 529s (basically sinking funds for two college and hopefully graduate educations; funding $100k into each before either kid is born)
   * $88k in HSAs
   * $56k crypto (up from $27k last year; just gains, no new funds)
*  ($302k) student loans/monthly CC balance

NewRetirement/Boldin currently projects that we have an 80% chance of funding retirement starting at \~45 and lasting through 100 years old. Note that there are a lot of spending, tax and other assumptions baked in here that would take too long to explain, and you generally have to manually update balances so it’s very slightly out of sync with the exact numbers from Monarch. This is up from something in the low 70% range when I started using Boldin/NewRetirement part way through the year.

**GENERAL INFORMATION & HISTORY**

This is my fifth annual year-end reflection post. At the beginning of my last semester of undergrad in 2012 I signed up for Mint, and I’ve kept it pretty up to date ever since. This was way, way before I started getting educated about personal finance and decided to take some career gambles, so the Mint graph above (now Monarch, since Mint was killed off by Intuit) show all of that pretty clearly.

Some general information.

* Spouse and I are currently 35/36 years old.
* After around March 2019 the chart starts to reflect household income, assets and liabilities (no material difference at the time, we were both more or less broke).
* We don’t own real estate, and likely won’t before we RE. All in on equity index funds. Figure the companies I own slivers of can deal with the hassle of owning real estate for me.
* I am a transactional lawyer, currently working at a biglaw firm in a VHCOL. Spouse is a recent MBA grad who did a stint at a large company but, after a year of unemployment, has transitioned to a smaller company.
* I don’t go too crazy with budgets or anything. We’ve got a decent apartment, like to eat at restaurants a lot and try to travel, but otherwise live pretty simply without trying too hard. I have gotten a little more spending conscious since moving to a VHCOL, though.

Some history:

* ***Pre-2012***. Grew up in a working class household. Parents didn’t go to college. Mom didn’t work. Dad was in the trades. Basically zero personal finance/higher ed/career guidance from family. Went to community college for two years, then did a 4-year degree at a big state college. Majored in a social science. Decided to try to go to a good law school. Worked at various fast food-type places over the years making minimum wage or close to it.
* ***2012***. Graduated with BA and worked for a year for local government. Made about \~$20k/year.
* ***2013***. Got into a T14 law school with no scholarship or other financial support. Decided to roll the dice and go despite the insane cost ($270k all in) because I didn’t really see any other opportunities. Was definitely a gamble since \~50% of people who go to even top law schools don’t end up making enough to be able to service that kind of debt load.
* ***2014***. Living off student loans in law school. Got a summer gig after first year at a small firm that paid $20 an hour. Most I’d ever made.
* ***2015***. Still living off loans, but this is where the gamble started to pay off. Got a summer associate job at a biglaw firm that pays on the NYC comp scale. I got super lucky—I only got 1 offer. Could just as easily have been 0. Made like $30k for working that summer, which was the most I’d ever made (basically made 150% of my peak annual income in one summer). Most luckily of all, I got a full time return offer.
* ***2016***. Graduated law school. Passed the bar. Racked up some heavy credit card debt since I wasn’t getting student loans any longer but had to cover COL for several months. Started full time at the firm. Salary $180k/year (but just for the back end of the year, so really just like $30k in 2016).
* ***2017***. Still at firm. Salary+bonus was $180k+$15k. Paid off credit card debt and about $50k in student loans (this was before I settled on the strategy noted above). Threw about $5k into crypto.
* ***2018***. Still at firm. Salary+bonus was $200k+$32.5k. Discovered the personal finance sub. Maxed all tax advantaged accounts for the first time. Got married. Some have pointed out in past years that it seems like my NW should be higher than it is considering the bull market and our comp. I blame that on the fact that up until around 2018, I was following the usual advice to aggressively pay off the student loans. When I realized in 2018 that that was likely to my disadvantage in the long run, I stopped and started aggressively investing instead (discussed in more detail in the FAQs).
* ***2019***. Still at firm. My salary+bonus was $220k+$50k. Spouse’s salary $60k. Discovered FIRE. Started piling cash into VOO/VTI/VXUS. Added spouse’s assets to calculations.
* ***2020***. Still at firm. My salary+bonus was $255k+$92.5k. Spouse’s salary $60k. Got spouse on board with FIRE. Spouse started a part time MBA at a top 25 school to try to boost household income in a couple years. COVID student loan forbearance kicked in so I was able to invest that money instead of making minimum payments.
* ***2021***. Still at firm. My salary+bonus was $305k+$160k. Spouse quit job to do an MBA internship, so between the partial year of pay at the old job and the summer pay at the internship probably made around $50k. COVID student loan forbearance was in effect all year, so we were able to put a bunch of money into the market. Plowed about $10k into crypto.
* ***2022***. Got an in-house lawyer job part way through the year, paying around $300k. Spouse started a $200k post-MBA job part way through the year. Moved to a HCOL city. Turbulent market and high non-routine costs given the move, but continued plowing money into index funds.
* ***2023***. Spouse quit post-MBA job partway through the year after one year. I returned to biglaw (I hated in-house). Among all of the employment turbulence, I made about $360k all-in, spouse made about $90k. While we still maxed out all tax advantaged accounts (including mega backdoor Roth for both of us), some big expenses this year put a dent in savings rate—moving to VHCOL and related expenses ($20k+) and emergency vet costs for a pet ($15k+). I sold taxable index funds to cover these (exercising for the first time my view that taxable brokerages can function as savings accounts at high enough numbers). Net worth nevertheless grew to $960k (note that I revised this down a bit from my post last year—long and annoying story, but turned out a small amount of my spouse’s funds that we were including in our NW actually belonged to my in-laws and I was able to exclude them with the transition to Monarch), up from $787k for 2022.
* ***2024***. Still at firm. My salary+bonus was $435k+$130k. Spouse got a new job over the summer with a $165k salary, so made a bit less than half that pre-tax—probably around $65k. Maxed out HSA, both pre-tax 401ks, and my MBDR.
* ***2025***. Made my firm’s equivalent of non-equity partner. My salary+bonus going into next year will likely be around $435k+$163k, but TBD on the salary—may be slightly higher. Spouse intends to keep working—salary will likely remain $165k, plus a TBD bonus. Still working on having a kid.

**SAVINGS & EXPENSES**

*2024 Cash Flow Sankey*: [https://imgur.com/a/gm9Gd4S](https://imgur.com/a/gm9Gd4S)

We had a 49.3% savings rate in 2024, with \~$406k in income and \~$200k in savings. Little disappointed we didn’t hit 50%, which was my goal, but close enough. Note that the Sankey generally excludes withheld taxes and business expenses/reimbursements. Our highest spending categories were rent ($60k, or 28.78% of income), restaurants/groceries ($41k, or 10.15% of income), general purchasing, student loan payments and travel/pets/entertainment (each between $20-$30k, or 5-7%; note that there’s some bleed between general shopping and groceries, since we often use Amazon/Whole Foods grocery delivery and it’s hard to tell the transactions apart).

Happy to hear any feedback on our spending.

**TARGETS & PLAN**

My general FI target is $5mm minimum, but would consider pushing for $10mm. Probably somewhere in between depending on how expenses/expected purchases look (some more detail on that below). Target withdrawal rate is 3%, with a flex up to 4% if the market is doing well. Currently considering retiring to a LCOL college town we like. Would keep working until we buy a house there, then wind down based on conditions at the time.

That said, I’ve broken out my FIRE targets into various sinking fund-type goals within Monarch, where I’ve partitioned off various accounts to track progress towards varying targets. As you’ll see, I’ve broken out separate sinking funds for certain expenses/expected purchases that I’d like to apply the FIRE math to separately (e.g., health insurance, real property, college, possible private school, passion projects, etc.). All of these are saved in equities. Currently our targets are:

* ***Baseline FI***. Target: $5mm. Current Amount: $1.43mm (29%). This is just our general FI amount.
* ***Primary Residence Sinking Fund***. Target: $500k. Current Amount: $30k (6%). I am saving separately for our primary residence, which we’d expect to purchase probably between 5-10 years from now. I’m sure some folks will be aghast that I’m saving for our primary residence via equities. I’m fine with the risk—I have no pressing desire to own real estate so don’t mind if I have to save longer if the market bombs, our horizon is medium-term, and I don’t like leaving any dollars not needed for daily operating expenses out of the market.
* ***Health Insurance Sinking Fund***. Target: $1mm. Current Amount: $25k (2%). I want to treat this separately from our general living expenses FI amount, so I can tie to the usually higher health insurance inflation rate. Expected costs are about $40k/year, so that means a ballpark target of $1mm.
* ***College Sinking Fund***. Target: $640k. Current Amount: $219k (34%). Note that, as mentioned above, I’m just funding $100k upfront in 529s. $640k is the projected cost of the most expensive college in \~20 years, so that’s the target. Expect to get close to that via compounding, then can fund the difference if needed out of other cash flow.
* ***Private School Sinking Fund***. Target: $500k. Current Amount; $6k (1%). Ideally can cover kids’ private school—just a posh thing that appeals to me as a first-gen for whatever reason. There is some bleed between the college sinking fund and this one since you can cover $10k/year of private school tuition out of a 529, which I can’t account for in Monarch. We may also not send them to private school, who knows.
* ***Other Real Estate***. Target: $500k each. Current Amount: $0 each (0%). Spouse talks a lot about having a beach/mountain vacation house, so I made buckets for them. I’m lukewarm on the idea, but not opposed, so I made buckets for them. We’ll see if we get around to filling them up. Same principles as for the primary residence discussed above.
* ***Retirement Projects***. Target: $500k each (one each for spouse and I). Current Amount: $0 each. I might open a solo practice for fun post-RE. Spouse talks about running a small, chill bakery. Who knows what we’ll end up doing, but want to have a small separate sinking fund to provide 4% annual draws for expenses on them. Can always not do them and treat these as part of the general FI pool.

**FAQs**

* ***Why are you doing FAQs…?***

Just noticed some themes over the years, so thought I’d frontload some responses to start the conversation further along.

* ***Why have you not paid off your student loans???***

Student loans are simple interest, whereas market returns are compounding. I have $300k in federal student loans at \~6% interest. Total payoff amount on a 30-year extended repayment plan is \~$512k. That number will never change. Instead of paying the student loans off, I invested $300k (the loan principal balance) in VOO in a taxable brokerage account. My bet (not really a bet, it’s just math) was that the compounding market returns would outpace the simple interest. Have been right so far—current value of that taxable brokerage is \~$532k after about 6-7 years (i.e., already exceeds the total payoff amount on the loans). I expect that brokerage account to double a few more times while I continue to make regular payments on the loans. Best move I ever made.

Some people are just so uncomfortable with debt, but if you follow the math it usually makes sense to pay off simple interest loans slowly and invest instead, even at higher interest rates. The usual doomsday hypo people scared of debt offer up is “what if you lose your job and stocks are down”. My response is: (i) you can easily get a hardship, etc., deferment or reduction in payments on federal loans in that situation so are pretty protected generally and (ii) worst case, you’d be selling stocks at a loss (maybe) to cover your loan payments until you get a new job—how long could that last even worst case? A couple years? And even in that situation, it’s not like you’d be selling everything, you’d just be reverse DCA-ing out of the account until your cash flow returns and probably wouldn’t be underwater forever on the stocks anyway. This all requires being comfortable with a little risk, but I don’t think it’s THAT much risk. Folks can be way too conservative with student loan debt. Student loans can be great leverage if you use them right.

* ***Why no bonds?***

I suppose this is personal preference. I would just rather 100% ride the market. I don’t sell when the market drops, and I have no interest in having a drag on my returns in the name of peace of mind.

* ***Why are you wasting time with sinking funds? It just complicates things unnecessarily.***

Don’t disagree. I just like thinking about them as buckets that I’m filling up. It’s all artificial partitioning anyway, can always just stop doing it.

* ***Why are you funding 529s before you have kids?***

Yeah, in retrospect I probably shouldn’t have done this, particularly since it’s not turning out to be so easy to crank out kids at mid-30s (thanks, microplastics). But it’s basically already done, so it is what it is. Will damage control this one later if kids don’t end up being in the cards

* ***Can you make these shorter?***

They appear to only get longer. This is pretty much an annual journal/reflection for me. Happy to chat/answer questions about anything. Thanks for reading!"

**SAVINGS & EXPENSES**

*2024 Cash Flow Sankey*: [https://imgur.com/a/gm9Gd4S](https://imgur.com/a/gm9Gd4S)

Happy to hear any feedback on our spending.

**TARGETS & PLAN**

My general FI target is $5mm minimum, but would consider pushing for $10mm. Probably somewhere in between depending on how expenses/expected purchases look (some more detail on that below). Target withdrawal rate is 3%, with a flex up to 4% if the market is doing well. Currently considering retiring to a LCOL college town we like. Would keep working until we buy a house there, then wind down based on conditions at the time.

* ***Primary Residence Sinking Fund***. Target: $500k. Current Amount: $30k (6%). I am saving separately for our primary residence, which we’d expect to purchase probably between 5-10 years from now. I’m sure some folks will be aghast that I’m saving for our primary residence via equities. I’m fine with the risk—I have no pressing desire to own real estate so don’t mind if I have to save longer if the market bombs, our horizon is medium-term, and I don’t like leaving any dollars not needed for daily operating expenses out of the market.
* ***Health Insurance Sinking Fund***. Target: $1mm. Current Amount: $25k (2%). I want to treat this separately from our general living expenses FI amount, so I can tie to the usually higher health insurance inflation rate. Expected costs are about $40k/year, so that means a ballpark target of $1mm.
* ***College Sinking Fund***. Target: $640k. Current Amount: $219k (34%). Note that, as mentioned above, I’m just funding $100k upfront in 529s. $640k is the projected cost of the most expensive college in \~20 years, so that’s the target. Expect to get close to that via compounding, then can fund the difference if needed out of other cash flow.
* ***Private School Sinking Fund***. Target: $500k. Current Amount; $6k (1%). Ideally can cover kids’ private school—just a posh thing that appeals to me as a first-gen for whatever reason. There is some bleed between the college sinking fund and this one since you can cover $10k/year of private school tuition out of a 529, which I can’t account for in Monarch. We may also not send them to private school, who knows.
* ***Other Real Estate***. Target: $500k each. Current Amount: $0 each (0%). Spouse talks a lot about having a beach/mountain vacation house, so I made buckets for them. I’m lukewarm on the idea, but not opposed, so I made buckets for them. We’ll see if we get around to filling them up. Same principles as for the primary residence discussed above.
* ***Retirement Projects***. Target: $500k each (one each for spouse and I). Current Amount: $0 each. I might open a solo practice for fun post-RE. Spouse talks about running a small, chill bakery. Who knows what we’ll end up doing, but want to have a small separate sinking fund to provide 4% annual draws for expenses on them. Can always not do them and treat these as part of the general FI pool.

**FAQs**

* ***Why are you doing FAQs…?***

Just noticed some themes over the years, so thought I’d frontload some responses to start the conversation further along.

* ***Why have you not paid off your student loans???***

Student loans are simple interest, whereas market returns are compounding. I have $300k in federal student loans at \~6% interest. Total payoff amount on a 30-year extended repayment plan is \~$512k. That number will never change. Instead of paying the student loans off, I invested $300k (the loan principal balance) in VOO in a taxable brokerage account. My bet (not really a bet, it’s just math) was that the compounding market returns would outpace the simple interest. Have been right so far—current value of that taxable brokerage is \~$532k after about 6-7 years (i.e., already exceeds the total payoff amount on the loans). I expect that brokerage account to double a few more times while I continue to make regular payments on the loans. Best move I ever made.

Some people are just so uncomfortable with debt, but if you follow the math it usually makes sense to pay off simple interest loans slowly and invest instead, even at higher interest rates. The usual doomsday hypo people scared of debt offer up is “what if you lose your job and stocks are down”. My response is: (i) you can easily get a hardship, etc., deferment or reduction in payments on federal loans in that situation so are pretty protected generally and (ii) worst case, you’d be selling stocks at a loss (maybe) to cover your loan payments until you get a new job—how long could that last even worst case? A couple years? And even in that situation, it’s not like you’d be selling everything, you’d just be reverse DCA-ing out of the account until your cash flow returns and probably wouldn’t be underwater forever on the stocks anyway. This all requires being comfortable with a little risk, but I don’t think it’s THAT much risk. Folks can be way too conservative with student loan debt. Student loans can be great leverage if you use them right.

* ***Why no bonds?***

I suppose this is personal preference. I would just rather 100% ride the market. I don’t sell when the market drops, and I have no interest in having a drag on my returns in the name of peace of mind.

* ***Why are you wasting time with sinking funds? It just complicates things unnecessarily.***

Don’t disagree. I just like thinking about them as buckets that I’m filling up. It’s all artificial partitioning anyway, can always just stop doing it.

* ***Why are you funding 529s before you have kids?***

Yeah, in retrospect I probably shouldn’t have done this, particularly since it’s not turning out to be so easy to crank out kids at mid-30s (thanks, microplastics). But it’s basically already done, so it is what it is. Will damage control this one later if kids don’t end up being in the cards.

* ***Can you make these shorter?***

They appear to only get longer. This is pretty much an annual journal/reflection for me. Happy to chat/answer questions about anything. Thanks for reading!"

My Issue With The Prdywen Tier List (Mini(Mega)-Rant),HonkaiStarRail,1hs4i7k,2025-01-02 16:08:22,0,0.48,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1hs4i7k/my_issue_with_the_prdywen_tier_list_minimegarant/,Dragoons-Arc,Discussion,"Prdwyen's tier list is flawed. I think that's a statement literally anyone can agree with. Whether it's the 'Specialist' category being a catch all for every non-traditional Crit DPS, or the controversial rankings of certain characters above/below others, there are a lot of issues that plenty of people have talked to death already.

My issue isn't with that though, I have my own opinions about all that but it's irrelevant for the context of this post. I'm going to talk about a fundamental flaw in Prdwyen's tier list that I guarantee 95% of people who even talk about Prdwyen don't know: their Criteria.

If you've never read it, I don't blame you. I think that between everyone who uses the site, maybe 1000 of them have read it, and about half of that actually remembers it. Regardless, I'll put their criteria verbatim here so there is no confusion.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Criteria

* Manual play,
* Using optimal team composition/support characters,
* Character level 80,
* All Major Traces unlocked and skills upgraded to level 8,
* Character equipped with level 80 **non-limited 4★ or 5★ Light Cone** (including the 'standard' Light Cones),
   * Battle Pass Light Cones aren't taken into account because you can't obtain them without spending,
* Character equipped with 5★ upgraded gear with optimal Main Stats and Sub Stats (with 24 desired sub stats out of a possible 54),
* Eidolon level 0 for 5★ characters,
* Eidolon level 0/6 for 4★ characters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, why is this an issue? Because of two major parts (mostly one). Level 8 traces and using optimal team compositions.

Because of these two pieces, this entire tier list has an identity crisis. The main question to ask is: Who is this tier list for?

Is this tier list for the new/casual player? If so, it should be emphasizing character's ease of use, ability to clear, ease of build for that clear, and teammate diversity. But it says they strictly use optimal team comps, so that isn't the case.

So, is it for the 'hardcore' player? If that's the case, then it should focus on the top end of that character, having them completely optimized with high tier relics, optimal comps, and maxed out traces. But that can't be the case either, as the relics are certifiably mid-tier and (more importantly) the characters are only put to 8/10 trace level.

For the sake of (trying) to keep this brief, I'll move on from this point, but it's important to keep in the back of your mind. No one tier list can encapsulate the entire gameplay experience of these characters, so having a predefined purpose in mind is important when creating a tier list.

The other (bigger issue) that comes from this is that, because of how this criteria is laid out, there is a severe disparity in characters abilities that isn't reflected in the tier list itself. This is because of the 8/10 traces rule.

You'd think with everyone being at 8/10, they are all disadvantaged, so none of them are, but that isn't the case at all. Some characters care A LOT more about this than others.

The best example would be the Fei Xiao comp. At 8/10 traces, all of their multipliers go down by roughly 20%\~, but they lose drastically more damage than just that. Fei Xiao loses 7% DMG on her talent, which affects her whole kit, so along with the 20% reduction, she's losing a bit extra.

This compounds with the other units on the team. Topaz loses 6% of her vulnerability which effects the whole team, Robin loses potency of her buffs, Aventurine his Crit DMG debuff, etc. Point is, all of these reductions compound on each other, to the point where running a 8/10 Fei Xiao comp is closer to losing 35%\~ of your DPS then it is to the standard 20%.

This goes the other way as well, specifically with Break comps. Break comps don't lose anywhere close to 20% of their DPS, because with how break and break characters fucntion, most character's buffs are flat and not tied to trace level (toughness damage, Mei's WBE, talent effects, etc).

Take Firefly for example, the only real thing she loses by going 8/10 is her ult which has a minor speed buff, and grants her a little extra break multiplier. Mei's WBE is static, so all you are really losing is 2% of her Res Pen, Lingsha is missing 3% vulnerability, and Fugue loses out on 12% SB and 3% Def shred.

Sure, it's not a non-significant damage loss, but you are losing maybe 10%-15% DPS tops. This huge disparity between Break DPS and Multiplier/Buffing based DPS isn't addressed on Prdwyen's rankings.

Based on THEIR OWN criteria, every single break DPS should be T0, and everything else should be in T0.5 max.

This becomes more of an issue when you consider what data they examine to create this tier list. They go off user submitted data, which I would bet 99% of them at least max out the important stuff on the kit beforehand. This means that they are making a tierlist, but aren't even following the fundamental components of their criteria, and if they somehow are following it, they are invalidating the user submitted data they get.

Either way you look at it, it's mess. Anyways, yeah rant is done. Probably nobody will read this, but I had to get it off my chest and write it cause it's been driving me insane for the last week thinking about it.

No hate towards Prdwyen, it's a good tool for the general playerbase, and they have a lot of valuable stuff on there outside of their tier list (when will you fucks be bringing back the character builder?). I just hope to see them improve upon their HSR section."

A short tutorial about particle driven carousels,davinciresolve,1hpjo87,2024-12-30 04:34:07,15,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/1hpjo87/a_short_tutorial_about_particle_driven_carousels/,Glad-Parking3315,Tutorial | English,"The goal is to show you how to manage particles to support clip animation. Usually the particles have random position and movement, with the pCustomer node (pc on the comp) we can control them individually.

The **pCustomer** has many tabs, we will use only 3,

1. **Numbers** : (n1 to n8 inside, NumberIn1 to NumberIn\_ outside), usually used to set parameters and animations.
2. **Inter** : To do some intermediate calculations on each particle, used frame by frame for each particle.
3. **Particle** : The place where we can force the behavior of the particles. By default, the values are those determined by the pEmitter and other particle nodes (pTurbulence and so on).

We start with the numbers we set:

* **n1** : The number of clips to animate, here 6
* **n2** : The radius of the carousel,  .8
* **n3** : the Y rotation of the carousel, an animcurve from 0 to 360 or keyframes as you want, can be also depending on the number n1 as that each clip can be seen during the animation.

The first thing to do is to set the pEmitter, the only thing to do is to set an expression to the number of particles :.

    iif(time==0,pc.NumberIn1,0)

which creates 6 particles. That's all for the pEmitter.

We go back to the pCustomer, Inter Tabs,  and enter these values in each intermediate :

* **i1** : id-2 , each particle has an id numbered from 2 for any weird reason and we want from 0
* **i2** : 360/n1 , the base angle position of the particle from the center of the scene
* **i3** : i2\*i1 , the angle of each particle
* **i4** : n3 , the expression of the particle Y rotation to face the camera
* **i5**: 90-i1\*i2 , the expression to calculate the particle Y rotation to face the center of the scene.

Now we jump to the Particle tab to set the expression to calculate the position of each particle. The x,y position of a point on a circle is determinate by cosin and sin and its radius, but here we want a circle on the x, z axis so we enter these expressions

* **Position x** : cos(i3)\*n2
* **Position z** : sin(i3)\*n2

*remember, i3 is the angle of each particle*

For the **Rotation Y** we can use either i4 or i5 depending on the result we want.

The engine of the carousel is finished, we have to attach the clips to the particles now.

There is many way now to attach the clips to the particles, but all use a replicate3D with **Alignement set to TBN Aligned.**

The classic one use one imageplane by clip.

The pro is that it is easier to understand and permits to create an animation as long as we want. The con is tha if you want to create an huge carousel with 10 clips or more its a bit boring.

The one I use here is adapted to video clip but need a little preparation in the edit page. All the clip are put in line  and reduced to the length of the desired animation on the timeline then converted to a compound clip. This  compound clip is then dropped in the composition.

Then we put an expression to the time offset as it ""connect"" each video clip at different time on the replicated imageplane :

* **Time Offset** : comp.RenderEnd+1

To make the carousel turning we enter the expression in the transform Y rotation.

* **Rotation Y** : -pc.NumberIn3

For stills we can use this method but a more powerful one exists which permit to set the duration of the animation as long as we want ... maybe next time :)

Here we are building a carousel, but we can use the same method to build wall animated videos or any kind of arrangement (like spiral and so on) with a little bit of math.

You will find the particle engine composition here : [https://pastebin.com/k211MvxZ](https://pastebin.com/k211MvxZ) you know now how to use it to build your own carrousel bythe way you prefer.

I made a text tutorial for a better reference tool and because I dont have time to make a video lol.

Furucombo Review - Strategies and How It Works?,CapitalistExploits,1hnewd9,2024-12-27 08:30:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1hnewd9/furucombo_review_strategies_and_how_it_works/,kayakero,,">**One of the most striking tools in the DeFi sector is Furucombo, a decentralized application that aims to facilitate the creation of interaction ""combos"" between different DeFi platforms, both on Ethereum and Polygon.**

In fact, Furucombo allows you to create these “combos” by means of a simple “drag and drop”, stacking blocks with certain characteristics and functions. In fact, Furucombo allows you to create these “combos” by means of a simple “drag and drop”, stacking blocks with certain characteristics and functions. 

Thus, a user can configure actions to make an exchange on Uniswap, then use the tokens in the AAVE pools, request a flash loan on said platform and finally withdraw the profits on Curve, all with a simple interface and stacking the blocks needed to do all this.

Furucombo was introduced in 2020 by Hsuan Ting Chu, CEO of Furucombo, and since then, this application has become one of the most used within the crypto ecosystem.

# How to use Furucombo

Furucombo offers its users three modes of use, each with its own capabilities and tools.

# Investment mode or Furucombo Invest

Furucombo's investment mode (Furucombo Invest), is one of Furucombo's features and offers a simple and intuitive interface so that even novice users can take advantage of it. The goal of the investment mode is to allow users to make profits from yield farming and liquidity mining/liquidity pools.

To participate in this mode, you only need to select the chosen token/pool and enter the desired amount to participate in it. As it is a decentralized system, all your funds are managed by Furucombo smart contracts, allowing you to deposit and withdraw your tokens whenever you want, without paying commissions to the protocol for it (you only have to pay the mining commissions).

https://preview.redd.it/52sa6tzjn69e1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d39b9323ea9c8547a0664d879d827c40fa086c

Furucombo Invest also allows users to auto-compensate their rewards with our Auto-Farming pools. This means that any yield farming reward token allows you to earn more APY through compounding effects. This is a very strong mechanism to grow your funds and earn more rewards in DeFi. 

Furthermore, the Furucombo staking contract also allows for earning multiple reward tokens. This allows for high rates of return depending on the tokens of the pool/farm you participate in and the delivery of compound rewards. However, this only applies to Furucombo auto-staking farms.

# Creation mode or Furucombo Create

The creation mode, or Furucombo Create, allows us to visualize and interact with DeFi protocols using cubes. These cubes can be stacked to create powerful smart contracts that allow us to perform operations on the protocols supported by Furucombo.

https://preview.redd.it/k7hkjsqmn69e1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ea7ebce9f8d1323d600dba6b361c2ccf2e8033

In this way, users can configure the inputs/outputs and order of the buckets, then Furucombo bundles all the buckets into a single transaction and sends it. We call this building block configuration a “combo”.

https://preview.redd.it/dhjveo9pn69e1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c77a5f85bb3566c15b05bdee53ef04cad5e4303

For example, if we want to swap COMP to USDT, and use these USDT within Curve to add them to its liquidity pool, we simply choose the buckets:

1. Uniswap Swap Token
2. Curve's 'Add Liquidity'

With these two cubes chosen, you will only have to indicate the amount of COMP tokens you wish to exchange and Furucombo will take care of carrying out the entire desired procedure in a single operation.

This way, you not only carry out your operation in one place, but you maintain decentralization and you will also receive the necessary rewards in the protocols in which you participate, according to their own rules. Thus, you are sure to continue enjoying all the benefits that DeFi offers to its users.

# Learning mode or Furucombo Learn

The learning mode, or Furucombo Learn, serves as a hub for clearing DeFi strategies. **This section allows you to discover the most commonly used combos within Furucombo, as well as combos that have been created by other users (or by yourself) so that you can use them on your own.**   By clicking on a strategy, you will be able to see a page explaining the purpose of the strategy and how this bucket strategy is composed. 

Another feature of this section is that they also include filtering strategies by popular tags and displaying relevant information such as APY, liquidity, and rewards. With these features, users can find their combo more easily.

# Furucombo Tokenomics

Furucombo has evolved a lot over time and part of that evolution can be seen in the creation of the COMBO token, which was made public with the launch of Furucombo V2. **The COMBO token aims to enable the sustainability and governance of Furucombo.** As a utility token, COMBO seeks to incentivize its holders to participate in the application and maintain its healthy operation and development.

Among the specifications of the COMBO token we have:

1. Token address: [0xffffffff2ba8f66d4e51811c5190992176930278](https://etherscan.io/token/0xffffffff2ba8f66d4e51811c5190992176930278)
2. Total issuance: 100,000,000 $COMBO
3. Standard: ERC-20
4. Type: Utility Token
5. Features: Governance, enjoy premium features and financial incentives.

https://preview.redd.it/rksn9u31o69e1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=f73e9ab800deb1c0afbd517ceb012d971824790d

Part of the tokenomic sustainability that COMBO will bring to Furucombo is in the fact that it will keep Furucombo as a free-to-use application. Performing operations on Furucombo does not require the payment of any fees except for the mining fee, which makes Furucombo one of the few DeFi platforms that are free to use. In this sense, COMBO will be a means by which the team will be able to maintain this system and at the same time:

1. Offer the community access to higher yield rewards using the COMBO token.
2. Fee rebates received from protocols such as Aave partnerships, Synthetix volume program, etc.
3. Participation in governance

The latter allows:

1. List the integration of new cubes;
2. Delete current cubes;
3. To decide on new associations;
4. Distribute more community-reserved tokens;
5. Granting subsidies to combo creators, developers, etc.

In short, Furucombo is owned and shared by COMBO holders, and the core development team will ensure that the ownership transition is smooth and consistent in the coming months.

Finally, the COMBO token supply will be distributed following the data shown in the image below:

https://preview.redd.it/jx1x5ig4o69e1.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0bdd591859bd28578a67fa401e3536880fcafc1

# Furucombo loyalty program

On June 6, 2022, Furucombo introduced the Loyalty Program to the community, which is nothing more than a series of rewards to users who use and support the protocol. The system has the following main features:

1. A points system that is divided into rounds
2. Accumulated points expire at the end of each round
3. The first round will last 3 months

To earn points, all you have to do is use Furucombo. From creating to investing, anything you do on Furucombo will allow you to accumulate points that you can then exchange for rewards from the protocol. For example, users can earn 20 points per week for every $1000 in stake they place in an auto-investment farm. Of course, every time you increase your stake, you will earn more points.

Another way to earn in this program comes from Furucombo NFTs. These NFTs allow each user to have one of each of the loyalty cubes (wood, metal, and diamond). Additional NFTs can be redeemed for points. Previously minted NFTs will also be redeemable for points according to the following schedule. Anyone who has these NFTs can request points to be added to their account based on the NFTs they own. There will be no need to burn your NFTs, and they will remain your property, as we do not want users to lose their moments.

Of course, these NFTs also have utility within Furucombo, highlighting:

# Wooden cube

1. 1.1x multiplier on points earned
2. It takes 1500 points to mint

# Metal bucket

1. 1.1 times multiplier on points earned
2. Loyalty airdrops (in tokens or NFTs)
3. 3000 points + 1 wooden cube needed for minting

# Diamond cube

1. 1.1 times multiplier on points earned
2. Loyalty airdrops (in tokens or NFTs)
3. Exclusive high yield option
4. Invitations to live events
5. VIP support and unique role on Discord
6. Furucombo Loot Pack

# Furucombo Security

Furucombo is a very secure protocol, however, you should pay close attention to how its combos work, especially the combos listed in the Learn section. Reading and knowing what each combo does ensures that you do not face any unexpected surprises. **For example, if you stake within Uniswap and you face an impermanent loss, you should know that this is within Uniswap's possibilities, and that it is not due to Furucombo itself.** 

On the other hand, Furucombo has faced security problems and has improved a lot in this regard. The 2021 attack led them to improve their care with the interaction of smart contracts and at the same time, create security measures to prevent it from happening again. 

At that time, an ""evil contract"" managed to steal 14 million dollars from the protocol, a situation that has not been repeated, making it clear that their team works to offer the best security to all their users.

Upcoming CompX TDR 14 Proposal is live and ready for community input!!,CompX,1hmo4vf,2024-12-26 08:16:07,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompX/comments/1hmo4vf/upcoming_compx_tdr_14_proposal_is_live_and_ready/,CompX-Initiative,,"Hi All,

As we're nearing the end of Gov 13 and more broadly 2024, we wanted to share with you what CompX is planning on for the new year and Gov 14. We've put together a [proposal](https://forum.algorand.org/t/gp14-defi-rewards-tdr-proposal-compx/13789) (follow the link to get in on the discussion in the Algorand Forum). The following is adapted from the post linked above.

In this round of TDR we want to focus on strengthening liquidity for our tokens - xUSD, CompX and cAlgo. All LP incentives using TDR funds will be delivered via our [Pact](http://Pact.fi) powered farms. We will support Tinyman farms for xUSD/Algo and CompX/Algo with a share of xUSD interest via our staking pools. These xUSD reward pools will require TM LP's to be staked at [CompX.io](http://CompX.io), under the ""Staking Pools"" section.

Total incentives: 130,000 ALGO

We will offer 30k Algo for users staking their Algo with CompX in preparation for staking rewards coming into play. This is, as with the LP incentives, to strengthen the use of cAlgo.

We will also have 10k Algo assigned to incentive the Gold/xUSD vault over on Algorai. This great use case of xUSD and Gold is a great asset to highlight.

xUSD/ USDC (StablePool) - CompX Farm 30k Algo

xUSD / COMPX - CompX Farm 5k Algo to farm, 5k Algo to lockdrop holders (to be distributed weekly to all eligible users directly to wallets)

xUSD / Gold - CompX Farm 10k Algo

xUSD / Silver - CompX Farm 10k Algo

cAlgo / CompX - 10k - CompX farm Algo

cAlgo / xUSD - 10k - CompX farm Algo

cAlgo / Algo - 10k - CompX farm Algo

Additional for CompX liquidity incentives are being provided for our tokens by our friends at Pact and Tinyman

Pact -

xUSD/cAlgo - 30k

xUSD/USDC - 25k

xUSD/Silver - 10k

xUSD/Gold - 10k

cAlgo/Algo - 30k

Algo/CompX - 10K

Tinyman -

xUSD/Algo - 10k

Remember that all PACT farms can be staked directly through CompX to get automatic reinvestment of rewards, or directly on the Pact site if you don't want to auto-compound.

There are a lot of options here, please feel free to hit us up on Discord if you have any questions. Thanks a lot for the growth and support we've seen this last Quarter. The future is looking bright for Algorand Defi, and CompX. Stay safe out there."

Dear \[Full Name\]

Seventeen-year-old Elenore should be thinking of prom night with her BFF-turned-GF, not dragging her murdered girlfriend’s body out of the forest. Armed with a prayer and a stolen spellbook from the library, Elenore attempts to cast a resurrection spell. Instead, she accidentally summons an injured eldritch monster from space. And it’s now hiding in her girlfriend’s body, unable to leave until it’s healed. 

Desperate to fix her mistakes, Elenore cuts the monster a deal: she'll help by feeding it human bodies. Once the monster heals, it’ll return to outer space. Now, Elenore begins balancing the life of an awkward geek by day and a teenage killer at night. At first, she can justify her murders by targeting those who deserve it—corrupt adults, bullies, and even another killer. 

But when she became a suspect in her own murders, Elenore grows disillusioned by her initial goal and wants to stop. The monster, however, has grown fond of her and wants to stay with Elenore, injured or not. Unwilling to risk her future anymore for the sake of a monster, Elenore vows to find another way to get rid of it for good. 

UNTITLED is an (est. 74000)-word YA horror novel perfect for fans of *Compound Fracture* by Andrew Joseph-White and *Don’t Let The Forest* In by C.G. Drews. \[My bio right here\].

CTRLV baits FL33T into Snuffed Out: AAR inside,Eve,1himkkl,2024-12-20 10:45:03,46,0.78,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1himkkl/ctrlv_baits_fl33t_into_snuffed_out_aar_inside/,Mikal_Vexor,Battle Report,"TL;DR, CTRLV got baited on a free Moros by Fl33T, who in turn got baited into Snuffed out. 

[Battlereport](https://br.evetools.org/br/67658abab8e3ec0012a8d77c)

[Video from Snuff perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLccrnbk2PE&ab_channel=RistGaming-%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8FEVEPartnershipprogram)

Legally mandated longpost that someone will inevitably complain about:

After being thoroughly bamboozled by a [Fl33T](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99011978/) bait [op](https://br.evetools.org/br/67658653b8e3ec0012a8d779) in Vard, [CTRLV](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005678/) pilots were eager to get even.  With Fl33T's [fretful caretaker](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99009927/) on deployment to null, the CTRLV brain trust decided that it was an opportune time to remind FL33T (and minmil by extension) who the real masters of the warzone are. Schemes were hatched and pings were pung. Friday morning (Thursday evening ustz) was bait day.  The plan was to wait for Fl33T to fuck off from Sosala (their staging system) for an op, after which CTRLV would bash some of FL33T's sprawling infrastructure. 

Considering our [previous experiences](https://br.evetools.org/br/67658704b8e3ec0012a8d77b) engaging FL33T mono a mono, we decided it was best to ask for help.  We therefore reached out to other venerable servants of the Empire for assistance. Unfortunately, responses from militia contacts consisted of incoherent rambling about whether Empress Jamyl had brain worms and frantic inquiries about whether Vard was stable. Undeterred by the lack of militia support, we reluctantly settled on coordinating with the owners of lower quality gamer chairs in [Snuffed Out](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99004901/), who remained logged off in Amamake in anticipation of FL33T committing caps.

CTRLV formed up about the same time as Fl33T, who were apparently preparing for an unrelated (and still unknown) objective. CTRLV, desperate to prove that the hull actually has a purpose outside of AT, formed navy geddons supported by guards / caps, and copious amounts of drugs. At some point Fl33T noticed the CTRLV formup in Aset (our staging system), and therefore opted to keep their 70-something folks docked in their Fort in Sosala. For about 40 minutes, CTRLV stared at FL33T's undock, Fl33T stared at CTRLV's undock, and about 100 mouth breathing idiots (myself included) sat on various servers waiting for the *other* spaceship team to do something. At some point during this boredom, Fl33T deployed a very cunning and not at all suspicious tactic of logging off 30 or so toons in the span of 5 seconds in hopes of obfuscating their numbers. Unfortunately, the opportunity to glean additional emergent counter-intelligence strategies from Fl33T's brain-trust was cut short by [Uusanen](https://zkillboard.com/system/30003077/) being pushed to a vulnerable state by minmil farmers, which induced FL33T to dispatch a lone moros (along with what must have been a dozen cynos) to bash the ihub.  

Battle was joined at approximately 02:49 eve time, with CTRLV conduit jumping navy geddons, guards, two RNIs, and two fax onto the hostile moros at 0 in Uusanen. Missiles danced across the expanse between hulls, and range bonused neuts from holy navy geddons began greedily guzzling the gallente hull's life-stream through dozens of shimmering energy motes. In an attempt at a rejoinder, FL33T assisted their imperiled vessel by dropping 8 t1 dreads (apparently unaware of the introduction of navy dreads two years ago) and approximately 50 shards of duct-tape embroidered driftwood that I am told is referred to as a ""CFI comp"". As the mighty hull of our [Ninazu](https://zkillboard.com/kill/123366223/) began to buckle under the compounded pressure of half a hundred shitfits, a CTRLV cyno emerged from the void and space around it began to writhe and boil. 

CTRLV's dread wing (consisting of actual navy dreads and zirns) hit grid followed almost immediate support from Snuff typhoon fleets and dreads. Enamored at the prospect of once again working with allies who *actually jump their dreads into combat*, CTRLV capital pilots followed snuff capital primaries and Fl33T vessels began to blink out of existence at an increasing cadence.  As grid was cleared, the inevitable report of Turnur local climbing was received, signaling that it was time to extract capitals before BIGAB could lumber over to Fl33T's toppled bicycle and re-attach the training wheels. Extraction of Snuff's caps proceeded without incident, but extraction of CTRLV caps was complicated by fax triage timers that didn't align with the rest of our dreads, one dread that accidentally two-cycled, and third parties. SEDIT, hearing reports of their long-lost capital wing spotted in space ([DnG](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98224639/) left SEDIT recently to reform CTRLV) without youngpuke2's expressed written authorization five-days prior, decided to make an appearance and and try to tackle CTRLV caps with strange loki based technology. Ultimately, by deploying an intimidation tactic consisting of pointing navy geddons at the enemy and looking very aggressive, hostile tackle dropped points and all capitals that survived the capital engagement were extracted.

HS-SPME-GC/MS Analysis: Fiber Conditioning and Desorption Parameters,massspectrometry,1hfi32h,2024-12-16 07:33:17,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/massspectrometry/comments/1hfi32h/hsspmegcms_analysis_fiber_conditioning_and/,Ambitious-Swan6062,,"Hello everyone!

I’m currently working on HS-SPME-GC/MS analysis of essential oils, and I’ve run into a few issues with my blanks that I’d love to get your advice on.

ANALYSIS SETUP: I’m using an Agilent 8890 GC system coupled with a 5977B mass spectrometer, with a PAL autosampler and SPME tool. The fiber I’m using is the dark grey (5191-5874), and the column is an Agilent DB-WAX (122-7032), with a temperature range of 20°C-250°C (260°C).  
The fiber was conditioned for 2 hours at 240°C in the inlet, following the manufacturer’s recommended range (up to 280°C), but I kept it below the maximum temperature to stay within the column’s limits.

During the two blank injections (using a 20 mL empty vial), I observed some significant peaks, some of which seem to correspond to cyclosiloxanes (which could be from the PDMS portion of the fiber). However, in the second blank, these peaks had lower intensities compared to the first.

QUESTIONS:

1. Fiber Conditioning:
   * If these peaks are indeed from the fiber, could this indicate that I did something wrong during the conditioning process?
   * Even though the fiber conditioning range goes up to 280°C, I chose to condition it at 240°C to stay within the column’s temperature limits. Is it correct to consider the column’s temperature range when setting the inlet temperature? I’ve come across conflicting opinions on this in some articles.
2. Purge Flow to Split Vent:
   * I’ve set the purge flow (10 ml/min) to split vent at 1 minute, but the desorption time is 5 minutes. Could this cause any issues? Or does the injection actually correspond to the total desorption time?
   * If I wanted to add a post-injection desorption, how would this be handled in this case?
3. New Observation with Sample Sequence:The entire process takes about 60 minutes. Adding the 56 minutes of chromatographic run time, the total time per sample is 116 minutes.However, I’ve observed that after about 10 minutes of the chromatographic run, the fiber reinserts into the inlet. Could this be related to the GC Cycle Time, which is set to 60 minutes?Additionally, I noticed a peak appearing shortly after this event that was not present before. Has anyone experienced something similar or can explain how the GC Cycle Time might influence this?
   * I’ve noticed something new now that I’m running samples in sequence. Specifically, the method is structured as follows:
      * 10 minutes of conditioning time;
      * 30 minutes of incubation time;
      * 15 minutes of extraction time;
      * 5 minutes of desorption time.

For clarity, I’m attaching the chromatogram images from the two blank injections. The first injection is shown in black, and the second one is shown inred, so you can compare the intensity of the peaks.

* VIAL CAP INTEGRITY:
   * After running a blank sample three times to evaluate the fiber and the analysis, I inspected the vial and noticed some peculiarities (at least to my eyes, though perhaps not to an expert). Specifically, I observed three small “cylinders” on the inner side of the cap (Agilent part number: 5188-2759), which I suspect were created by the insertion of the fiber holder structure. These look similar to small core drillings in the material of the cap. Could these cause any issues during the analysis? Could they also potentially damage the fiber?
   * Additionally, I noticed that two of the punctures created by the fiber holder structure remained open and clearly visible. Considering that this analysis targets volatile compounds, wouldn’t this pose a potential problem, particularly when performing duplicate analyses?
* SAMPLE VIAL PENETRATION DEPTH (SVPD):

I have a question about the Sample Vial Penetration Depth (SVPD) setting. Does this value take the length of the fiber into account?  
For example, if I set the SVPD to 40 mm and the fiber is 10 mm long, what is the actual penetration depth? Is it 

\- ""Real SVPD"" = 40 mm depth + 10 mm fiber = 50 mm TOT

\- ""Real SVPD"" = 30 mm depth + 10 mm fiber = 40 mm TOT

* SIGNAL INTENSITY AND PEAK SHAPE ADJUSTMENT

If the signal intensity is too high and the peaks don’t have a clear shape, would it be better to reduce the sample volume in the vial (currently, I’ve added 75 µL of essential oil in a 20 mL vial), or should I decrease the extraction time instead?

Thank you very much again for any help and suggestions!"

Crypto History: Gaming Timeline for the 2021 Bull Run,KARRATCRYPTO,1heic5d,2024-12-14 20:57:49,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KARRATCRYPTO/comments/1heic5d/crypto_history_gaming_timeline_for_the_2021_bull/,tracksta6,,"In the 2020–2021 bull run, specific cryptocurrency genres (e.g., meme coins, gaming coins, DeFi tokens) experienced surges of interest at different times. These shifts were driven by evolving market narratives, trends, and hype cycles. Here’s an analysis of when each genre gained major inflows of capital:

https://preview.redd.it/as32vw0t5x6e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c862be8aa72bf4354664f5f98b5d0f9c9a208d7

>**1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Initial Surge: Mid-2020**

* The DeFi boom began in summer 2020, often referred to as ""DeFi Summer.""
* Key drivers included platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP), and [Yearn.Finance](http://Yearn.Finance) (YFI), which introduced yield farming and liquidity mining.
* DeFi tokens dominated attention from mid-2020 to early 2021 as users chased high returns and DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged.

>

>**2. Gaming and Metaverse Coins - nitial Surge: Mid-2021**

* Gaming and metaverse tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) gained traction during Q2–Q3 2021.
* Axie Infinity drove the narrative with its play-to-earn (P2E) model, which saw rapid adoption in emerging markets.
* The metaverse hype reached its peak in late 2021, fueled by Facebook’s rebranding to Meta in October 2021.

>

>**3. Meme Coin** \-  Initial Surge: Early 2021

* Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged in popularity during Q1–Q2 2021.
* Elon Musk’s tweets and the broader retail investor craze (e.g., Reddit-driven pumps) contributed to the explosive growth of DOGE, which peaked in May 2021.
* SHIB followed in Q2–Q3 2021, fueled by its community-driven growth and listing on major exchanges.

>

>**4. Layer-1 Protocols**

* Initial Surge: Late 2020 to Early 2021
* Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) saw significant inflows as Ethereum faced scalability issues.
* From late 2020 through Q3 2021, investors sought alternatives to Ethereum, driving the growth of competing blockchains.

>

>**5. NFT -  Initial Surge: Q1–Q2 2021**

* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in early 2021, driven by projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and major auctions like Beeple’s $69M NFT sale in March 2021.
* The NFT craze aligned closely with the gaming/metaverse hype in Q3–Q4 2021, expanding into broader cultural and entertainment sectors.

>

* **6. Privacy Coins -  Initial Surge: Early to Mid-2021**
* Coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) saw renewed interest in Q1 2021, as concerns about regulatory scrutiny and privacy grew during the bull run.
* This genre's surge was smaller compared to others but aligned with broader crypto adoption.

>Observations and Takeaways:

>Rotational Capital:

1.  Money rotated through genres as the market narratives shifted.
2.   Early adopters of each genre benefited the most as capital inflows surged.
3.   Gaming as a Late-Stage Winner: Gaming and metaverse coins often peaked later in the cycle, especially during the altcoin season after Bitcoin and Ethereum had their major runs
4.    Meme Coins Thrive on Hype: Meme coins tend to surge during periods of retail euphoria, often spurred by social media campaigns.
5.    DeFi Pioneered the Bull Run: DeFi projects laid the groundwork for mainstream crypto adoption in mid-2020, establishing foundational protocols.

Looking Forward to the Next Bull Run - If historical patterns repeat, gaming/metaverse tokens like Karrat could see their major inflows in the latter stages of the next bull run, likely around Q3–Q4 2025. Meme coins and NFTs might see earlier retail-driven pumps, while DeFi and Layer-1s could kickstart the cycle.

4 Year FIRE Progress - 36yo (2nd Year Update),FIREUK,1hd8mlv,2024-12-13 04:28:47,33,0.87,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/1hd8mlv/4_year_fire_progress_36yo_2nd_year_update/,firecontender,,"https://preview.redd.it/avz76mcqxl6e1.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=5deff3c2561b3d4061f453d71a8f2c8d37548146

**2024 Charts:** [https://imgur.com/gallery/fin-charts-2024-w4BjkMQ](https://imgur.com/gallery/fin-charts-2024-w4BjkMQ)

**Previous Update:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/s/iFQn9TuefB](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/s/iFQn9TuefB)

**Personal:** 36 years old, based in Scotland, currently living with my partner(not interested in fire) and work in finance. Working-class background, no financial support from my parents.

**Income Update:** Total comp increased by £1.8k this year to £77k. While my base salary rose by £3.4k, this was offset by a reduction in my bonus. Monthly after tax, share schemes and pension I take home £2.4K and can just about live off that every month. (Although this year has been really expensive)

**Job Potential:** My current role has the potential to grow to approx £100k over the next 10 years, which would be awesome. I enjoy my job, have a great work life balance and have no plans to move away from this role in the near term.

That said, I anticipate that my position could become obsolete within 5–10 years, so need to think about future-proofing. (See question below)

**Financial Ambitions:** My goal is to achieve FIRE by 55, with a healthy(£1m+) pension pot. To bridge the gap between 55 and 58 (when I can start pension drawdowns), I plan to build a 3-year ISA buffer. 

**Pension Update:** My pension has seen impressive growth, from £100k a year ago to £160k now. Compound interest worked it’s magic this year. I contribute £2.1k monthly, plus any bonuses I receive. (This is up from around £1.3k per month last year) My investment gains this year were actually higher than my contributions!

**2024 Challenges**

* **Missed Opportunity**: I sold company shares to pay off my mortgage, only to see them nearly double in value afterward.  So frustrating but it felt like the right decision at the time.
* **High Spending Year**: Spent c£8k on Holidays (big birthday trip next year), my 10 year old car, and concerts (since when did they become £200 a ticket?) made this a very, very expensive year. I suppose the holiday and gigs could be put under highlights, the car can fuck off. 

**2024 Highlights**

* **Mortgage-Free**: Paid off my mortgage in Q1—a huge milestone!
* **Pension Growth**: My pension has grown significantly due to markets and £ v usd.
* **Reframing:** I need to reframe my annoyance about high spend this year. Yes, I’ve had an extremely expensive year, but… I have some amazing experiences out of it and ultimately my wealth has still grown by c£70k!! 

**2025 Goals**

* **Cut Discretionary Expenses**: Tackling overspending will be a top priority.
* **Relocate**: I’m considering selling and moving to a larger home. While this could disrupt my FIRE plans slightly, it’s an essential step for my long-term happiness.
* **Car:** My car has caused quite a bit of cost/frustration/anger this year. I’ve been so unlucky. Finally got the car fixed and then a massive pothole caused a puncture and shock absorber failure. A goal in 2025 will be to get a new car.

**Questions for team FIRE:**

1. To future-proof myself, I’m considering upskilling or pursuing a degree in an area such as **data science, climate, AI, or analytics**. Any recommendations would be appreciated. (I’m currently in a finance role, using lots of spreadsheet based data)
2. I’m so so fed up of my car at the moment that I’m thinking of doing salary sacrifice at work. It would mean I don’t need to worry about servicing, or anything going wrong, although on the other hand would likely mean a large reduction in pension. Talk some sense into me please!

300 hours Korean learning progress,Korean,1hd6nuh,2024-12-13 01:54:38,41,0.95,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1hd6nuh/300_hours_korean_learning_progress/,The_Master_Scrub,,"I've been wanting to do a progress piece so that I could look back on it in the future for comparison, and considering I just recently reached 300 hours on my tracker I decided now would be as good of a time as any to write it.

*Note: the first section ""explanation of current statistics"" helps to provide background for the following sections but I accidentally made it a little wordy and I've been writing for way too long so I give up on editing... feel free to skip to the learning background section if you want lol.*

# Explanation of current statistics:

*Hours stats:* The 300 total hours include anki flashcard time, which currently totals 84.07 hours. I counted mostly by feel - say a video is 60 minutes long but I took 2.5hrs to watch it because I was looking up a bunch of words and grammar, and maybe got distracted by discord for 30 minutes. That could be counted as anywhere between 1 and 2 hours depending on how active I felt I was in that time. I believe the current count of 300 hours is the most accurate estimate of my time spent immersing in Korean, but take it with a grain of salt. The hours count does not include time spent on-and-off learning prior to 2024.

*Words stats:* Below you will find my stats as listed by Kimchi Reader, however there are a few things that would be good to know for understanding these statistics if you have never used it before. Kimchi reader runs based on a combination of krdict and stdict, and any word in those dictionaries can be manually marked as seen or known. There are many foreign words that you don't *really* have to learn to know - for example 피자 or 택시 - and for this reason there is a separate stat for known/seen without including foreign words.

* Known: 4374
* Known (minus foreign): 3926
* Seen: 2810
* Seen (minus foreign): 2584
* Mined: 3809
* Total days (including days inactive on the app): 329
* Known (very pessimistic): 3154
* Seen (very pessimistic): 2208

\*Explanation for the ""very pessimistic"" stats: Kimchi Reader has likely the most accurate statistics tracking out of its competitors due to its outstanding parser, but it is still not perfect. For example, say you know the word 기대 and the basic verbs 하다 & 되다. Kimchi Reader allows you to mark words based on if they're in dictionary or not, and since many words have the noun form, 하다 form and 되다 form all listed as separate dictionary entries you can instantly gain +3 known count from 기대, 기대하다 & 기대되다. There are also what I like to call ""free words"" - exclamations like 아이고, 에구 or 응, or compound words that are completely obvious in meaning when you know their constituent parts . To address this I've manually calculated some pessimistic statistics which take out the foreign words but also the -어지다, 하다 and 되다 variants, and finally subtracts another 500 from that known stat to make sure there are no free words counted.

As of now I have been learning Korean for just under 11 months, and have reached a known word count on kimchi of 3926 without foreign words, but lets break it down further: I use the seen stat for words that I know but am not confident with (with bad context I might not recognize a seen word, but in 90% of cases I would). In fact, I have mature anki cards for more than half of my seen words but am just not comfortable enough to mark them known yet. I use the known stat for words that I am completely confident in knowing regardless of context. Since I use the stats this way I think the best representation of my current level counts both the seen and known: using my pessimistic estimate on the fourth row of the table, that would be at least 5362 words in context.

# Learning background:

**The beginning:**

In 2017/2018 I spent some untracked hours going through the first 2.5 TTMIK grammar textbooks before I lost motivation and gave up. To my best estimates this would've been somewhere in the range of 10-30 hours, but since I don't know specifically it is not included in my hour count. I restarted learning Korean this year around the end of January/start of February using an extension called Kimchi Reader (which you may have seen me shill for on this reddit before). Kimchi reader enables a popup dictionary for Netflix, YouTube and Viki subs, as well as any text documents or websites. The popup shows useful information such as definition, estimated frequency, hanja, and most importantly to this post it allows fast flashcard creation and statistics tracking for known/seen/unknown statuses on each word you see. After going through a few basic videos and my TTMIK textbooks to kick-start that statistic tracking, I found that I could vaguely remember about 300 words and a handful of the basic conjugations from TTMIK 1&2 - this is what I am considering my starting point, and where I began to track my hours. At that point in time I had also not yet done any Korean flashcards.

**Progressing:**

I always found learning with textbooks incredibly boring and unmotivating, but Kimchi Reader allowed me to have more fun than I ever had learning Korean previously. Right from that 300 word starting point I dove into a daily routine of watching anywhere from 30-120 minutes of native content per day while making a boatload of flashcards with Kimchi Reader. This included vlogs from my favourite kpop groups, variety shows, a select few kdramas (although I'm not the biggest fan of kdramas), and directly attempting to memorize some of my favourite kpop songs. It was nearly unbearable at first, but I used dual Korean-English subtitles to bridge myself over the initial vocabulary gap. I also occasionally used the easy 두루책방 graded reader built into Kimchi Reader to give myself a break from the hard native content.

I began to occasionally use Korean-only subtitles instead of dual subtitles after reaching about 1800 known & 2000 seen count on Kimchi Reader, but this was still only for easy videos and fairly rare. Around this point in time I was very active in the learning process and doing between 30-50 new flashcards every day - I managed to reach a 3-month average of 30 cards/day in anki for a very brief moment, but at a certain point I grew tired of flashcards and began to just learn by watching more content with definition lookups. All throughout this period I was picking up certain grammar forms directly from comparing the English and Korean subs in videos, but for the grammar forms I couldn't figure out only through watching I supplemented with googling them and reading a page about the grammar using whatever resource I could find - usually HTSK or KGIU, but the occasional reddit post or tumblr grammar post came in clutch for some more obscure grammar.

By simply pausing my videos to look up the unknown grammar whenever I had the urge, I stopped needing grammar lookups for the average kdrama or YouTube video by around month 5 or 6 of learning, and even in month 4 those lookups were already slowing down in frequency. I don't profess to have mastered Korean grammar at six months, or even now - there's still about half of KGIU advanced that I don't know, and there is advanced grammar that KGIU doesn't have at all - but most of those unknown grammar forms are things that you would normally only see in flowery writing, legal documents, historical dramas, etc. I was all set for your average kpop vlog by this point.

I disliked reading at the beginning because I have a very prominent inner monologue and I hated listening to my mental accent on words, on top of being painfully slow. At around month 9 I began to branch out to reading a few 무림 만화 since I had enough listening input that I could find my inner monologue at least tolerable. At this point, I could generally follow the plot of the story just reading it without lookups on my phone, but many finer details were still lost. I also began an occasional diary using Korean - I often need lookups for some finer details of what I'm trying to write since much of my vocabulary is not active for use, but I can generally find at least some way to write what I want on my own. As of today, I have written 8 A4-size pages in that diary.

# Current ability:

**Objective Analysis:** The following ""comprehension/comp"" stats are based on coverage of all words in a video, not unique words. For example, if the only English word you knew was ""the"" and a video contained the sentence ""the apple was the best "", then that would be a comprehension of 40%. Below are a few examples of my empirical word coverage on a few YouTube channels (YT) and kdramas (KD), listed as a range from worst to best comp for videos containing at least 300 words, and calculated including my seen words:

(YT) Didi's Korean podcast:                  76.14%-98.41%           (average \~96.5)

(YT) 허팝:                                              68.29%-98.41%           (average \~93)

(YT) Dreamcatcher:                               83.06%-97.86%           (average \~94)

(KD) Change days:                                91.51%-96.94%           (average \~95)

(KD) Itaewon class                                79.99%-91.05%           (average \~88)

By looking through the Kimchi Reader recommendation system, I can see the lowest comp I achieve on any kdrama is 57.95% on a historical drama episode, closely followed by a few documentaries. The videos I normally watch tend to be in the 93-96% range (but closer to the 93).

I now use korean-only subtitles the large majority of the time, but will still switch to dual subs occasionally for lower-comprehension content if I'm feeling lazy. I have put functionally zero practice into speaking out loud and have absolutely no confidence in my ability to utter a single word. I occasionally text in Korean in the #한국어 channels of a few discord servers I'm in and can generally find a way to express my sentiments, but find myself often short of the word I really want to use and needing to do some word gymnastics to convey the message I want. If I ever need to look up grammar (which is quite rare at this point and will likely remain rare until I start reading more real books), half the time it's for something I already knew and just forgot - recent examples being -렴, -소서 and -ㄹ세.

**Subjective Analysis:**

*Listening:* My listening ability is tragically bad, and if I'm watching a video where people are speaking over each other, where people are mumbling, or sometimes if its even just a speaker I'm unfamiliar with then I will struggle to make out words. I absolutely require subtitles in almost all cases. I can make do without subtitles only for incredibly easy content like Didi's Korean podcast since she speaks slowly, clearly, and uses simple vocabulary - as a matter of fact, I'm so comfortable with that podcast sometimes I'll listen while doing chores or going on a walk and I'll still understand most of it, and this is the only podcast I do that with. I rarely watch livestreams due to my poor listening skills, but when I do it's usually livestreams from kpop idols I follow. If I were to hazard a guess, I probably understand somewhere between 20-70% depending on what specifically they're talking about and how clear they're enunciating on any given day (yes, it varies a lot). I also continue to struggle a lot with speed - if I'm watching a video with a rapid speaker then my comprehension will drop off a cliff, even if I could read the sentences all individually and understand them without lookups. This is a simple issue of processing speed that I can only hope will go away in another couple hundred hours of Korean listening.

*Overall vocabulary:* My vocabulary still sucks. The friction of watching a video doesn't truly begin to reduce until you reach near 98% comprehension, which I achieve on very few videos as of yet. Many videos that I want to watch I get low to mid nineties comprehension percentage on, which is generally reasonable enough to follow a plot without lookups if you're willing to sacrifice some details - but depending on what specifically you're watching those unknown words can either be a minor nuisance to not know or absolutely imperative to know for your understanding of the content, and the latter is not fun.  Any video with under 90% comp kind of sucks. Any video under 80% comp *really* sucks.

I can normally follow generally what is happening in a vlog from a kpop artist who I am used to watching, or youtube videos from easy channels like 허팝. I can follow along with the plot of the easiest slice of life kdramas without lookups, but for anything actually interesting I often need to look up words. At my stage, it's truly a matter of what you're used to: I have just enough vocabulary that channels and people who I've seen a lot of or very basic slice of life content is possible (but not yet very comfortable) to follow along with reasonably well, while anything outside of that narrow domain is a pain in the arse.

**Fun observations:** I have found that it feels like my comprehension is improving in stages rather than the constant progress that it is in reality. From stage zero of knowing nothing, I first felt like I had noticeably improved my comprehension abilities after reaching 1600 known/2000 seen on Kimchi Reader, and I again felt that I my comprehension had improved a stage when I reached 3200 known/2800 seen. Now I just wait for stage 3, I suppose....

I also find it interesting that from the kpop concerts I've been to, despite my poor listening skills I can generally understand most of what they're saying. My best guess is this is because they're people I'm used to listening to and concert talks are fairly predictable creatures, but who knows.

# Conclusion:

I still suck. As of right now, the amount of content that is mildly frustrating to watch is much greater than the amount which is satisfying to watch. That being said it's fun and rewarding to learn and understand a language so fundamentally different from your native tongue, and if there is anyone on this reddit who is not yet learning Korean but was thinking about it - and for some reason read through this whole brick of text - I would highly recommend it. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask and I'll try to answer at least some of them.

The rims are WTB SX19’s and they don’t say TCS or TR or TL or anything like that on them. The tires I believe are the WTB Ranger Comp’s. At least that’s what it says they come with on the website. The tires aren’t marked with the model. They only say (57-622). So I’m wondering if these tires are able to be set up tubeless. I’m kind of pissed that the website says they’re tubeless ready but everything I’m seeing online says they aren’t. I wouldn’t have gotten the bike if I knew it was going to be a pain in the ass to convert to tubeless. I live in Phoenix where tubeless is basically required if you’re going off road.

But tempting fate, I broke the golden rule: If it ain't broke - don't fix it.

I wanted to install Linux Mint on it instead (\***aggressive facepalm**\*).  I first tried by just inserting the bootable USB and restarting the comp, that didn't work so I tried to manually select it using the BIOS boot manager, but it didn't recognize the USB.  I read somewhere that I may need to update the BIOS, so I followed the instructions to the word:

* downloading the latest BIOS update from MSI's website,
* renaming it MSI.ROM,
* putting it on a FAT32 USB's root drive,
* putting that USB in the BIOS Flash USB port,
* and with the computer turned off, I pressed the Flash BIOS button.

The Flash BIOS LED on the MOBO would blink slow, then faster as the system turned on, but the EZ Debug CPU LED also came on, and the BIOS flash LED just never stopped blinking.  Failure.

I tried everything under the sun for a full weekend, scouring forums for solutions.

* Very carefully and gently cleaned CPU, ensuring no thermal compound was on the pins
* Carefully inspected and confirmed no bent pins on CPU
* Carefully reseated CPU.
* Tried with 1 RAM card instead of 2
* Tried RAM in all different ports
* Tore down the machine, removing everything from the MOBO except PSU power to CPU and MOBO.
* Tried 6 different USBs for flashing the new BIOS.
* Tried different version of the BIOS.
* Tried different USB partition formats.
* Tried different USB ports, even dongled USB-C and even putting BIOS on an SSD in the M.2 slot.
* Removed the CMOS battery for 10 minutes and jumped the pins to refresh CMOS.
* And even more futile, desperate strategies after that.
* And then i retried all of the above a 2nd and 3rd time.

No joy.  Debug LED on the CPU would always turn on, and blinking would always continue indefinitely.

I guess it theoretically it could be the budget PSU, but I have to think it's a corrupted BIOS issue considering everything was working fine until I attempted BIOS flashback.

Luckily, it was within 14 days of purchasing the MOBO from Best Buy, and they accepted my return. I'm buying a new MOBO now...and I just want to avoid this nightmare from reoccurring.  I legitimately don't have time to go through another weekend like that.

And so, I come to you on my knees, pleading for answers:

* Where did I go wrong?
* Could I have just been unlucky?
* Is Linux the problem?
   * In my experience, Linux is never the problem, but considering 98% of the custom pc build market is Windows, I have to wonder if I have encountered some kind of edge case with respect to the OS.

Most importantly:

* Does anybody have good/bad experiences with certain AM4 motherboards under $200, particularly with respect to booting systems with Ryzen 7 5700x CPU, or Linux builds generally?

I respect the shit out of all you brilliant and most erudite tech wizards in this subreddit, so much love for all the help!"
Cannot claim COMP on BASE,Compound,1halbu2,2024-12-09 16:45:02,1,0.6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/1halbu2/cannot_claim_comp_on_base/,Organic-Ride-5192,,"TL;DR - It looks like all CLAIM operations are [failing on BASE](https://basescan.org/address/0x123964802e6ABabBE1Bc9547D72Ef1B69B00A6b1).  
  
I've been trying to claim my accumulated COMP on the BASE network.  
  
I've used Compound for years and have done this all before, but it's not working this time around.  

1. Using the [compound.finance](http://compound.finance) UI, in the comp menu at the top, I can see my balances across 2 markets (both on BASE).
2. I click ""Claim 2 Balances"" 
3. That puts 2 pending actions in the UI window. 
4. Complete Approval transaction via MetaMask (success)
5. Submit

For the actual transaction MetaMask raises a warning ""This transaction is likely to fail"" with no further explanation. If I ignore that and submit anyway, well, sure enough it fails.

I've tried setting very high gas limits (1M), and it still fails without using anywhere near that much gas.

I've also tried claiming just market instead of using the batch contract, but that fails too.

Looking at the CLAIM operations on the BASE COMP contract, it looks like I'm not the only one:

[https://basescan.org/address/0x123964802e6ABabBE1Bc9547D72Ef1B69B00A6b1](https://basescan.org/address/0x123964802e6ABabBE1Bc9547D72Ef1B69B00A6b1)

The failures seem to have started on 12/04/2024, intermittently at first. Now all operations all failing.  
On BaseScan: ""Warning! Error encountered during contract execution \[**execution reverted**\]""

Does anyone know what's up? Do I need to set some specific gas limit on my transactions? Or has the COMP pot run dry?"

The same goes on fields with six clanmen sitting at the field forty minutes before the respawn is up while the harvesters are full of broken comps, and if the clan overseeing the field was generous enough to have open harvesters you have jackass Ocdt ranks that either lock them full of comps so they can drop off a load at the refinery and then come back and refill, rinse and repeat, or an alt AFKs in the harvester while the main drops off their comps. The only reason they don't drive the harvesters all the way to the refinery is because a sign tells them not to take them off the field, so when someone complains they whine that they only violated the spirit of the law.

The cycle never stops and they never stop to think about how this compounding cycle affects the frontlines. Where are these components even going to? I've seen a grand total of two fields churning out concrete early war, and saw where that concrete went to - if you're one of the clans that does this or you make rmats into public logi, then good on you, you've done nothing wrong, but some of you just aren't getting it.  If a handful of clans are going to utterly monopolize fields and mines with > 95% uptime, then I would hope that the needs of all the other players in terms of rmats and concrete are met, AKA the rest of us don't have to worry about gathering components, but that's not the case.  

Fronts are constantly starved for vehicles because they're sitting in private stockpiles unused, 20mm rifles are absolutely broken right now but it doesn't matter because you'll never see one on your front, every big ship that isn't CCF is rusting in the center hexes because clanman hasn't learned they don't have the manpower or energy to run more than 5% uptime on their expensive toy, and 90% of Allod's, Fingers, Reavers, and Marban have sat with zero conc despite having enough time to tech howitzers.

I don't want to play a game that tells you upfront faction wide cooperation is needed and then bump elbows with three private harvesters that just rolled up so they can make a max queue of tanks so they can have a couple hours of fun, while the other 22 hours of the day . If you're gathering components on that scale, either you commit to being a public service that is boosting your frontline, or you dial it back and only take what you need because I'm tired of the amount of expensive ships sitting at the backline being used as glorified coastal guns instead of doing damage to structures,  and helping the faction win. Stop trying to see how many rmats you can shove up your butthole and let them see the light of day for a change.

TLDR IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO USE THE HARVESTERS GET THE FK OFF THE FIELD AND LET OTHER PEOPLE USE IT, 5K IS ALL YOU CAN CARRY FOR A REASON."

"Why you should consider in Comp these next few days. (Nfa, personal reasoning)",Compound,1h7fdvc,2024-12-05 13:01:29,14,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compound/comments/1h7fdvc/why_you_should_consider_in_comp_these_next_few/,MaximumInfluence4994,,"Comp is seriously underrated right now, and people sleeping on it might regret it. Here's why:

1. Innovative Purpose: Compound revolutionized DeFi by letting users lend and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries. You can earn interest on idle crypto or take out loans without selling your holdings—completely decentralized. It's a game-changer for financial autonomy.

2. Earnings Potential: If COMP hits its all-time high (ATH) of ~$911 again, that’s a massive upside from its current price (check the live price to plug in specifics). If you’re holding, even a small bag could yield life-changing returns.

3. Future Growth: With increasing adoption of DeFi, Compound is well-positioned to benefit. Plus, they're consistently improving the protocol—upgrades like Compound III (focusing on efficiency and scalability) make it even more attractive for institutions and retail users alike.

4. Why Now? We’re still in the early phases of broader DeFi adoption. If traditional finance players integrate Compound, or if DeFi surges during the next bull run, COMP holders could see exponential growth.

Not financial advice, but the fundamentals + potential are too good to ignore. I’m holding and ready to ride this one out."

Simplifying DeFi,Yield_Farming,1h6ifkw,2024-12-04 10:16:30,21,0.97,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yield_Farming/comments/1h6ifkw/simplifying_defi/,tsurutatdk,Discussion,"The DeFi landscape is evolving rapidly, offering endless opportunities to earn yields and grow assets. But with so many platforms, strategies, and tokens, it often feels like navigating an intricate puzzle.

What if there was a way to make this simpler? That’s where Yelay comes into the picture. Rather than spending hours researching which protocols yield the best returns, Yelay acts as a gateway to the best DeFi opportunities. It aggregates top protocols like Aave and Compound, automating strategies that help you earn more with less effort. For instance, Yelay can allocate your DAI on Compound to accrue APY while simultaneously converting rewards like COMP into additional yields.

The same goes for Aave, where it streamlines lending strategies to maximize your gains.

  
What sets Yelay apart is its unique YLAY token. This isn’t just another governance token—it actively enhances yield generation, giving holders extra benefits when they stake or participate in the ecosystem. By holding YLAY, users can amplify their rewards, making it a key component for anyone serious about optimizing their DeFi portfolio.

  
But Yelay isn't just for individual users—protocols like PERQ are harnessing its power too. PERQ, a launchpool protocol, uses Yelay's yield layer to fuel its staking pools, offering participants presale allocations for top projects. One solid highlight? A recent token presale sold out in just 1 minute and 43 seconds, showcasing incredible demand.

With Yelay’s infrastructure, PERQ has: Paid out $1.4M+ in rewards. Generated $500k+ for launch partners. Reached a peak TVL of $25M.

DeFi is already a powerful tool for financial independence, but platforms like Yelay make it accessible and efficient. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting, Yelay bridges the gap between complexity and simplicity.

Contractor Hired: General contractor (did not do actual work - used employees on workers comp to perform work)
City, State: Seattle, Washington


Issues:
- Contractor had 5.5mm Kore LVP, needed to get to 12mm thickness to match prior engineered hardwood. Said they’d use a thicker underlayment, did not do so and now there are noticeable gaps between floor and door trim.

- Already gone through three rounds of make-goods due to awful work (they scratched and scuffed boards, tried to cover scratches and scuffs with wood filler, they cut boards too short near the wall, so 1/2” thick baseboard wouldn’t cover the entire gap, their installation and lack of use of self-leveler made the bubbling on the floor worse, they made terrible cuts around trim so gaps exist between trim and floor boards - they attempted to cover some of these gaps with wood filler)

- Visible damage to cabinets from being careless on site when moving materials around. Hard to get a color match or fix since these are IKEA cabinets, so we’re not sure what to do.

- Visible damage to walls (chunks of drywall missing from corners) due to being careless on site when moving materials around.

- Visible damage to door frame due to being careless on site when moving materials around.

- Lifted/raised boards in some areas where the board is the last board (horizontally) against the wall. Contractor and workers insist that baseboards are used to hold those pieces down

- Boards against bathroom tub decompress when you step on them. Caulking job they did around this area is crap, and since boards decompress, the caulking is tearing and cracking. 

- Put a screw into the housing of an in-floor electrical heater so a board would stop moving, rather than making a more precise cut so the board wouldn’t move. We didn’t approve them drilling a screw into the housing, and are not sure if this violates WA State code. Did not even make the screw flush.

- Put boards too tight against an in-floor electrical heater so part of it is now warped and pushed back toward the wall, so that baseboard will overlap on top of part of the heater on at some portions of the wall, and sit behind it on the floor at others. This was not the case with the prior floors, and the contractor refuses to agree that the issue is caused by the boards being cut too close under the heater’s housing.

- When they finally agreed to put self-leveler down, they first just spread a concrete compound in some of the more egregious areas. After that didn’t fix the issue, they wanted to make-good again and brought actual self-leveler, but did not apply it to the entire area - only did minor spots so it didn’t fix the issue where boards decompress when stepped on. Finally, they did another make-good round where all the flooring was taken out and they applied a thin layer of self-leveler. But instead of using primer underneath as requested (and paid for), they put the primer on top of the self-leveler, which the contractor says is normal (despite all my research that says otherwise). They applied the self-leveler too thin and had no QC of the leveler so that there were bubbles in the leveler and rough bumps.

- They didn’t apply self-leveler close enough to one of the housings for a heating unit, so when you step near it there is a major decompression and lip between the floor and heater.

- They mixed the self-leveler indoors and were careless so there were a lot of splatters on the newly-painted walls. Did not clean it up so it was up to my partner and I to clean and wipe it up.

- Since they insisted on making things right several times and had to remove the boards, they wrote in pencil on the boards so they could place them back in the appropriate areas. They didn’t erase the numbers so they’re still there and my partner and I now have to go through and erase them.

- Some of the boards are damaged and lifted at the edges and corners so when you walk across it you can feel the sharp edge

- We asked they don’t send the same workers for the final make-good since the workers were clearly frustrated and had not done a prior job. They sent one new person, but one of the former workers showed up halfway through the day, and made it extremely uncomfortable.

They’ve attempted to make things right three times. This project started in late-August and ran through end of September. We’ve since gone on a trip and returned to a place we don’t feel good about - we see all of the issues, it makes us feel uncomfortable and have an ill taste in the place, and know to achieve the goal of improving value (if not just restoring value) of the place we’ll need to get the floors completely redone. As such, we sent an email to the contractor outlining all the issues and requesting a full refund.

Not sure if they’ll issue us one, but if not, based on all issues above, is it worth it to sue? My thought would be if we go to small claims court to request the original amount plus what it will cost to get the floors redone.

HRBP - Salary Negotiation Guide ,interviews,1h5fjvk,2024-12-02 23:47:45,12,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1h5fjvk/hrbp_salary_negotiation_guide/,TheWorstTypo,,"Hey Guys!

I'm an HRBP Director turned consultant and have been fortunate enough to work with some pretty big companies to get a lot of experience into how companies view compensation. As I now consult, i run into the same issues no matter the company and I come to subreddits like this and I see the same questions and misunderstandings, so hopefully some of this will help, but please feel free to ask. Ive designed compensation strategies and models using exclusive market research data for large engineering teams, product, finance, sales and marketing. Someone in my role is the one you are ultimately negotiating with during the offer phase in addition to potentially an exec of the business unit and a comp manager.

Disclaimers:

\- My experience is ONLY in corporations. I can't provide any meaningful info in other types of entities like Medicine, Legal, Education or Government

\- Nonprofits are always an exception to best systemic practice because their model is based on paying you as little as possible, and then guilting you when you complain that you have to pay rent

\- StartUps are complete chaos models because they don't use any practice but heavily index on monopoly money, with the hopes you make the founders rich and maybe you get a small payout too

\- What I share below is GENERALLY best accepted systemic practice, but you might work for an asshole or a shit company.

\- As thorough as I will be, I will inevitably forget a unique circumstance or exception, it's fine if this doesn't align with your experience or if you did something that's not best practice and it worked for you.

\- Best systemic practice usually activates if the organization has more than 300 FTES, that's about the time it becomes beneficial to invest in compensation to ensure the company has a philosophy and a standard model they can show as they have to be state and federally compliant against potential pay disparities

Ok, here we go:

1. At the conclusion of the phone screen, the recruiter and you should have an understanding of what the general target range the offer will land in if you are selected at the conclusion of the interview. Companies that do not do this are huge red flags
2. You CAN proactively ask first what the salary range is. Against stupid common advice, do NOT ask ""what's the budget for the role"" if you are asked your salary expectations as it may work against you. Instead provide a large range and ask a lot of follow up questions
3. As the company gets close to offer, it will start doing an analysis of how your potential offer will impact the comp philosophy, stability and internal equity of the team.
4. This sometimes surprises people, but I as the HRBP, the recruiter and the hiring manager all want you as the candidate to feel excited by the offer. One of our favorite things is someone who says their comp expectations are $95-$110, but the min of our range is $130, and the offer is $140k.
5. We use a calculation called a CompaRatio or CompRatio to talk about comp models and internal equity. We calculate CR by taking your salary and dividing it by the mastery salary in relationship to 1

So: if you make 75,000 and the MP is 100,000 your CR is .75 or 75%. If you make $115,000 - your CR is 1.15

Most companies have a general spread where they want everyone between .80 - 1.20

So if you're below .8 you are flagged as undercompensated and listed for immediate concern

.8 - .9 is ""learning in place"", most companies will make offers in this range

.9 - .95 is ""senior performer"" essentially someone who is close to mastery

1 is mastery

1-1.2 is the spread above mastery to allow for further reward

Above 1.2 will be flagged as a concern, it may be possible that a re-levelling needs to happen or that you may not receive further increases (but youll get other cash incentives like bonuses)

6. All of this is calculated while you are going through the offer phase and it's why counteroffers can take so much time, because we usually have to review it against an entire team to ensure were either not causing a disparity, or we are taking a measured risk with knowledge of the disparity

7. Companies expect you to negotiate. Expect your first offer to be on the lower side. They will never go below the minimum of the target range, so first offer is usually .80 - .85 if that was the pre-determined range. The exception to this is if you are high qualified or potentially overqualified for the role, in which the offer might be made between .95 - 1.05. If anyone says along the way ""this is our best offer"", do NOT negotiate.

8. Throw out ""Always Negotiate"" and replace is with ""Always Ask"" - this is a business relationship, you're allowed to ask questions. Ask about their comp philosophy, if they use CRs, and would they share CRS, how the offer matches against other recent new hires, and if the offer has been reviewed against potential gender/ethnicity gaps

9. When negotiating, NEVER use personal reasons or bills. Companies view salaries as a business expense, and I have approved some CRAZY offers because they provided a strong business case to the offer. If in doubt, refer to points you made during the interview to strengthen your points

10. ALWAYS negotiate over email - you will feel too much pressure. The company doesn't give AF. This creates a system of record, allows you to communicate and take your time putting together your points, it allows us to forward it to everyone we need to review and since offers can have so many elements, it's a great way to ensure the right information

11. Negotiate with caution. There is no rhyme or reason or industry or pattern where I can say ""don't negotiate in these circumstances"" - we are seeing an estimated 1.9% of offers being pulled as reported pulls for negotiation. Just be self-aware

12. If you do negotiate, ENSURE you are negotiating with the range that has been discussed, if not no more than 5-10% above the top

13. Signon bonuses are one of the biggest misunderstood concepts to new hire offers. Most people just feel like they should be offered one. I get it, I'd like that too! But the purpose of this bonus is to offset a financial loss that you would take if you accepted this role. Examples are a performance bonus that you'd miss, a 401k vest or a stock vest.

14. New hires will make more than you. I've given up on trying to convince companies to fund more to their existing employees. Even in the most aggressive internal raise system, it was nowhere near how fast the market moved. Stay in companies for 3-4 years. Around that time, unless the company is being super vigilant, you are likely going to be in the .80 range, especially if you've been promoted as that compounds the issue. At this point you are in market decay and the company has ZERO vested interest in giving you the significant raise you need to be on par with the market, that's the time to leave. On average, in an EXACT role to role change, you can earn about 29% increase on the most conservative end.

15. ""You can't get rich working for someone else"" is a common phrase and while there is SOME merit to this, the fact is you can make a very comfortable living working in Corporate America if you understand two primary concepts:

A: Compensation is determined by 6 factors: Job Level, Job Family, Industry, Company Size, Location and Role <>Industry<>Company alignment (ie, how much value does your company place on your position)

The more you work these to your favor, the more you have what we call the golden circle. Perfect examples of this are B2B Tech Salespeople who are clearing 300-500,000k a year within several years in commissions alone. Another example are software engineers in tech companies.

B: Make INTENTIONAL moves to increase your compensation. There was a 4 year period in my earlier days where I couldn't wait to break the $150,000 salary range and I thought everything ater that would be like I was rich. I had NO idea what is really out there.

Many companies use mix-model compensation types. This means they don't want to just pay you in salary and will additionally offer more cash incentives like an annual bonus, and even better stock.

Working for a company that offers Equity as part of their compensation is one of the easiest ways to make life-changing financial decisions.

One of the places I'm consulting with, I just helped put together an offer for a Sr Manager of Data and Analytics, he has 7 years experience. His salary is $165,000 ($5k less than what he was making now, he shared that in his negotiaton), but he is eligible for an 18% bonus, and he received 2000 shares of stock, at 500/shares per year vest.

Right now the stock price is between 150-225

I'll let you do the math.

I know it's MUCH easier said than done to just ""find jobs that pay better"", especially in this market, so this is instead just a reminder than as things stabilize and improve (and they will, we are already seeing some of the pre-signs), think about how to move towards companies that offer far more in compensation than just salary alone.

While not an exact identifier, usually it's larger companies, or well known companies with high profit margins, check things like the S&P, F1000 or just really large companies.

Alright, I'll make another post about compensation once you work inside a company later, but I do hope this was helpful, and if anyone has questions, Im happy to try and answer them

New Player - Trying to Improve,TeamfightTactics,1h53z3h,2024-12-02 14:52:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamfightTactics/comments/1h53z3h/new_player_trying_to_improve/,markhamjerry,Gameplay,"Hi, I recently started playing a week ago on a whim/was bored and am now completely addicted. Looking for ways to improve as playing ranked and (hopefully) climbing is an aspect I love in every other game I play. 

Here is my profile with all matches: 
https://tactics.tools/player/na/SplinterShot/NA1/NA1_5169700236

Any suggestions, tips, recommendations are welcome. A few specific areas I seem to struggle with:

1. Comp flexibility and commitment - Sometimes I get early Kog (first minion stage, first carousel) and I commit even though others may build out Kog later. How do I manage this better? I’m always scouting but sometimes if I get contested later it feels like too much sunk cost for me to pivot completely.

2. Early game tempo - if it looks like I’m going heimer, black rose, twitch bruiser, zoe/illao rebel etc, I sometimes lose so much tempo building gold/interest trying to get to lvl 8? In these situations i’m <30/40 health by 4-1 and it feels dire and I find myself getting stuck rolling down to 0 to hit 2 star 4costs (or higher). 

3. Itemization - I find it’s hard to strike a balance between holding parts for ideal items, or just item slamming based on current board/parts. Sometimes this issue compounds with #2 above, I slam items and STILL lose too much tempo? Isn’t the point of early slamming items to bleed out less 

4. Augments and anomalies are still hard for me to prioritize. I’ve looked at online resources and stuff but in the game it always feels like such a hard decision to make. I do always take an extra emblem where possible as it seems to be the most consistent value (got me 10 rebel one game lol) 

Any other suggestions or tips are welcome.

Trenchers Vs Black Labels ,TRX4M,1h4gp9v,2024-12-01 18:23:07,18,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4gp9v,bigherm30,Build Updates & Photo Sharing,"Lots of testing done this week. Both tires tested on the same beadlocks both with custom flub rc inserts made specifically for each tire. Wheels are running brass rings up front and aluminum in rear. I can… without any doubt say.. trenchers are significantly better than the black labels. Trenchers use the proline predator compound and these performance much better than the NL4 comp compound from LGRP. I tested in a variety of conditions (corona Del Mar- sandy rocks) (Del Cerro San Diego- jagged rocks and dirt) (foam- home course) and the Trenchers won at each location. The black labels are simply too soft, once they break traction they slip and slide around, each with anti foams. I reallllly wanted the black labels to perform but I have had better results from cheaper injora tires. They are not a bad tire by any means but they aren’t a great tire. I have come back to the black labels multiple times and really got them broken in and it seems that the more they get broken in the worse they perform… the opposite is happening with the trenchers. Both are solid options but prolines offerings seem to perform much better "
ORA and CompX token Vaults are online! (and Peg stuff),CompX,1h0h0wd,2024-11-26 12:13:32,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompX/comments/1h0h0wd/ora_and_compx_token_vaults_are_online_and_peg/,CompX-Initiative,,"Hi All,

TL:DR - ORA and CompX tokens can now be used as collateral for the borrowing of xUSD. Get more out of your crypto by staying liquid. Also we are aware that xUSD has had trouble maintaining its peg. This is of paramount importance to us and we are planning to incentivize liquidity in multiple ways to drive a more stable price and is able to maintain $1.00

We're excited to welcome CompX and ORA token holders to borrow against their token as collateral. As we've discussed in previous posts, these tokens have lower liquidity than some other larger tokens like Algo or goBTC. For the safety of the communities involved and the stable-coin protocol, vault parameters have been chosen to minimize risk to all parties. We look forward to these communities finding more utility in their tokens using xUSD.

Anyone who has been watching xUSD recently has seen that we are having trouble holding our $1.00 peg. In this current bullish market there isn't a huge demand for holding stable-coins, as people want exposure to appreciating Algo and ASA prices. Two of the strategies that we're seeing executed with xUSD are gaining leveraged exposure to a non-stable asset and swapping to USDC for the ability to deposit in USDC lending markets that currently offering eye-watering interest rates. Both of these strategies involve minting, then immediately selling them for other tokens. This naturally depresses the value of xUSD on the open market. In order to deal with this we need the price be less volatile. Currently, because our price varies more rapidly than we want due to lack of liquidity, large de-pegs can be partially mitigated too quickly for the interest rate changes to kick in. As a result, we end up with insufficient effectiveness of our variable interest rates and staking. We want de-pegs to be smaller, and more stable to give our tools appropriate traction to push the price back up to peg.

As a solution for this, we are going to incentivize users providing liquidity in two ways.

1. Direct incentives paid out of our interest. A sustainable and scalable incentive - Currently 20% of our incoming interest is diverted to our xUSD staking pool as a peg control mechanism. While this staking pool will persist, the 20% that has been diverted to it will be shared with users who stake Pact xUSD/USDC stable pool tokens with CompX auto-compounding farms. Users in the staking contract will notice a significant decrease in the rewards for staking as this comes online, making it harder to mint xUSD to profit. We don't have a date for this change yet, and we won't change anything without making it clear on our social media channels, including Reddit.
2. Our overall rewards program will reward Liquidity. An early adopter incentive - Our rewards system for the disbursal of the CompX tokens allocated to the community will begin soon. The general design of the rewards system will have a set amount of community allocated tokens be released weekly. Users that use our services, like swapping, having a vault or providing liquidity will be rewarded from this set amount according to how much they've done to support the protocol compared to everyone else. Liquidity will be a large piece of this, as it's absolutely mission critical. We'll be talking more about our rewards system as it comes closer to release, but we just want to make it known that we will be leaning on liquidity provision pretty hard.

What we want to convey is that we see the poor peg adherence and we recognize the importance of holding reliable value for our users. Our goal now is to prioritize liquidity depth, which will amplify the effectiveness of our current interest infrastructure to stabilize xUSD.

We appreciate your support and look forward to improving our reliability for our users.

Thanks for the read, and stay safe out there."

Custom Honda CB550 Cafe Racer | Purpose Built Moto,CafeRacers,1h00sm4,2024-11-25 21:10:11,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafeRacers/comments/1h00sm4/custom_honda_cb550_cafe_racer_purpose_built_moto/,Purpose_Built_MotoAU,General,"I could tell Scott wanted something special, and with his choice of donor bike being a Honda CB500 or CB550 I knew we could build something special. This was the perfect project to show in detail exactly what happens with our bikes as they come together. 



https://preview.redd.it/aaq0scsfl53e1.jpg?width=6207&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2969f4900c2c9c6819b836a056b74b89ec00b4e6

From the outset we had a vision in mind that would deliver Scott a motorcycle that would stop traffic with its looks, and blast past it with how it performed. I always bang on about reliability of our motorcycle but I truly believe that is one of the most important aspects of a custom build. 

Clients come to us because they want beautiful motorcycles, but a motorcycle they can ride. In my experience if a bike is too hard to ride for fear of being let down, it tends not to get ridden as much as it should. 



https://preview.redd.it/9tc2fifll53e1.jpg?width=6785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a98acfcdba41c720b88fc24233461629bb628e2a

So when we build a motorcycle as much effort goes into making sure our rider can hit the button and just go, as goes into creating that perfect style our clients are after. 

This build has been crafted to create a feeling of nostalgia. The colour schemes and finishes we’ve used draw from an era even before the Honda CB550 was manufactured but the feeling is undeniable. When looking at the CB550 Café Racer you feel like you’re looking at something that your hero would roll up on in a black and white movie. 



https://preview.redd.it/jfx01bjol53e1.jpg?width=7008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e5f4164e53de43d8d67f1d6d8feaf540fabe20f

With the all new chrome and polished finishes the front end gleams. Using a single gauge, custom triple clamp and clip on bars. We’ve also upgraded the front brake using a modern calliper and performance lever that give you far better control over your ride. All of this tied together with custom fabricated lighting and gauge brackets and a hand built front fender using our [DIY fender kit](https://purposebuiltmoto.com/products/fender-fabrication-pack-2). 

The fabrication on the rear was kept very simple, with a clean, upswept hoop added and our custom frenched in brake light set up forming the base of the tail. As requested by Scott our client we’ve built a brat style seat for 2 up riding and a removable tail cowl for everyday single seat riding. 



https://preview.redd.it/fb05yk7rl53e1.jpg?width=7008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11ef4d47061187a6b804e32018c03780a727bd08

When fabricating the tail I wasn’t struggling to find a nice way to mount the tail and still have it easily removeable. I couldn’t figure out hidden mounts and trying to make the mounts discreet just wasnlt going to work. Often when faced with problems like this, I’ll just go in the opposite direction. I’ll make a beautiful looking mount that doesn’t need to be hidden. We’ve used a button head M6 screw to fasten the tail and shaped up some polished aluminium teardrop panels that fit to the tail. Now the tail mounts are a draw card and detail worked into the design.

The wheels on the Honda CB550 are another vintage styled addition. Using 2 x 18” valanced rims, polished up to match the refurbished hubs and wrapped in Avon tyres. I speak on the 18” wheels in the series and I find it improves the handling of these bikes nicely, but doesn’t remove the classic styling like the use of 17” wheels would. 

https://preview.redd.it/5mq0q543m53e1.jpg?width=7008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6949b3a2d9757094ab008a8df261074e53b630a1

The Engine of the Honda CB550 Café Racer was a large piece of the rebuild for this bike and a heavy feature in the series. Having not run in a number of years our engine builder Jesse had his work cut out for him to make this vintage Honda sing again. With all new and refurbished internals and performance upgrades that include a Dynatek ignition, high comp pistons, ported and polished head and a bank of Mikuni RS carburettors the 550 has more than enough power to satisfy our 105kg rider. On receiving his CB550 Scott has all but retired his Ducati Monster. With the performance dialled on the Honda CB550 Dream Bike Build we went in and started making it pretty. With some highly polished cases, upgraded tappet covers, select chrome work and a customised finned stator cover the motor is a diamond set inside its customised exterior. 

https://preview.redd.it/goa28z77m53e1.jpg?width=7008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d64f4f1e198a4f4c038958b41d4fdf4817761570

To finish out the shape and style of the bike I set about building the exhaust, a stainless steel 4-2 exhaust, perfectly symmetrical on the bike with a flowing set of compound curves that flow under the engine and out the back of the bike. Finishing into a set of our torpedo mufflers the sound out of this bike is as good as you’d imagine. Take a look at our YouTube Build run down to see what I’m talking about, the test ride scene on this video is amazing. 

With that it was time for paint, Nathan from Livin Loco helped us out with a custom mixed vintage grey that was laid over the frame and tins only detailed by some very select and elegant filigree work done in white gold leaf. Watching Nathan work his magic on this paint job was a real highlight of the shannons dream bike build series as I’m usually never present for it, I just see the end result.

Lastly we had to find a matching leather for this very unique colour we had created. It was no easy task but Jamason and I persevered until we found that glass slipper for the Honda CB550 café racer. Timeless autotrim has sewn up a very simple design seat cover and back pad that attaches to the removeable tail. Using a woven leather detail and terracotta coloured leather there’s no other colour that would sit on this bike as well, regardless of your opinion of brown seats. 

With all the elements in place we went and put this bike through its paces on one of the most rigorous and fun filled test rides I’ve ever done. We travelled all over the gold coast shooting and riding this bike for the series, working out a few kinks along the way ensuring our rider Scott was in for the time of his life upon picking up his brand new 1973 Honda CB550.

The exhaust note is a welcome piece of audible feedback as you pull back on the throttle, with this gleaming example of custom excellence underneath you pointing this bike into a corner wide open is a real thrill. Every part of this bike upgrade or refurbished and operating to perfection. The ride instills ultimate confidence to push this bike for all its capable of. As the revs climb past 4000rpm the bike comes alive and sings right through the rev range. Sharing a few rides with Scott after the bike was done was a real treat as we watched him learn his new machine and start to feel at home in the saddle.

Tammy Faye: A Retrospective,Broadway,1gx6war,2024-11-22 07:40:16,88,0.89,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1gx6war/tammy_faye_a_retrospective/,ellapeterson-moss,Broadway,"Well, friends, we have arrived at the inevitable closing notice of *Tammy Faye*. And what a wild ride it’s been. I know this opinion piece is a few days late, but I wanted to take my time composing my many, many thoughts.

I’d like to be clear out the gate here: The responsibility for this failure does not rest with us, the audience. Neither is it on the dedicated cast, who worked tirelessly to implement changes that ultimately felt superficial. Their efforts, though commendable, amounted to little more than a mere bandage on a much deeper wound. The blame here lies squarely with the creatives and producers.

In this essay, I’ll outline the rise and fall of this musical’s journey, where things went wrong, and what we’ve learned from—in the legendary words of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber—this “costly mistake”.

If you’re reading this and don’t know the origins of the musical, let me present a brief recap:

The musical *Tammy Faye* launched at London’s 300-seat Almeida Theater for a limited two-month run in October 2022 starring Katie Brayben (as Tammy Faye Bakker) and Andrew Rannells (as Jim Bakker) and was met with generally favorable reviews and well-sold crowds. Keep in mind, the Almeida is a subscription-based theater, and therefore already had a mostly built-in audience. The excellent cast round out the rest of the sales. The show won two of the four Olivier Awards it was nominated for: one for Katie and the other for Zubin Varla (as Jerry Falwell). Bolstered by the momentum, it was meant to move on to a West End run, but when Katie became pregnant, that plan was scrapped.

Instead, the team opted to transfer straight to Broadway’s 1600-seat Palace Theater with a $25 million capitalization. It was announced in March 2024 that both Katie and Andrew would reprise their roles—the production going so far as to put their names up on the marquee and begin selling tickets shortly thereafter. However, months later at the Tony Awards Red Carpet, Andrew announced that he would no longer be a part of the production, and that he “thought it was odd” they announced him when no contracts were signed.

This, amigos, was the first domino to topple, setting off a chain reaction of disconcerting occurrences to come.

With speed as their guide, the team quickly secured a new leading man in Christian Borle. This move inevitably drew even more attention to the replacement situation considering Borle and Rannells played unlikely lovers in the 2016 revival of *Falsettos*—a show with a fervent fan base to this day. Michael Cerveris joined the cast as Jerry Falwell a month later. The full cast was announced in August 2024 with rehearsals beginning in early September.

It was around this time it struck me how sparse the advertising efforts had been, including the eerily silent social media engagement. That sentiment would continue throughout the rehearsal process. Advance ticket sales told their own story: low and sluggish. But in this post-pandemic age, they don’t necessarily make or break a show like they used to, although they're certainly welcome. Still, very little was being done to “spread the good word"", as it were. To compound the situation, it was decided to close off the balcony due to these disappointing numbers—another blow to this already struggling production.

By the time the first preview came around, audiences didn’t know what to expect because so little had been shared. And well…one can simply search here on Reddit to see the responses it garnered. Spoiler Alert: They were not good. Viewers were confused, grappling with a plot that felt fragmented, despite its episodic nature. The star, Tammy, seemed more like an afterthought, her notable absence from scenes leaving a void that muted the story's intended impact. Adding to the disarray was the tonal inconsistency. The narrative swung erratically between dramatic realism and camp, leaving many unsure of what the show aimed to convey. The set design, draped in dull colors, evoked memories of the low-budget aesthetic of old game shows, contributing to a sense of cheapness that many couldn't overlook. And then there was the pacing—the play ran long, and audiences felt the drag. But the general consensus? It was boring, plain and simple.

With time being of the essence, it became apparent that rapid change was essential, so the team mobilized and did what they could to slice and dice. Cerveris chronicled the journey on his [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/michaelcerveris/) through candid live videos, recounting the relentless daily wave of cuts and revisions. I personally caught the show about a week before it should have been frozen—[you can read my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1giq312/tammy_faye_112_preview_review/). News Flash: It was also not good.

As negative sentiments spread, attendance dwindled and grosses plummeted. The cast continued to face an onslaught of changes—changes that seemed to fly under the radar for most audiences, even the repeat viewers. The title was rebranded to *Elton John's Tammy Faye* to try to bring more attention to its star composer. In the eleventh hour, the marketing team rallied with two live GMA performances—both of which failed to substantially increase ticket sales.

*Tammy Faye* opened on November 14th, 2024 to brutal reviews, eviscerating the book and score. The cast, specifically standouts Brayben and Cerveris, received praise amongst the scathing notices. Unfortunately, with the abysmal grosses, non-existent advance sales, negative reviews and even worse word-of-mouth, the writing was on the wall. Just five days later, the production announced would be shuttering on December 8th, 2024, playing a mere 24 previews and 29 performances.

So. Numerous questions hang in the air: Why did this happen? How could such a large-scale, hotly anticipated transfer fall so far and so hard? And more importantly, what have we all learned from this colossal failure?

Putting the quality of the show itself aside, who was the audience? Certainly not native New Yorkers, who largely hold distain for faith-induced politics. Certainly not the Bible Belt tourists, who would reject Tammy's embracement of the LGBTQ+ community (and sneer at graphic musical numbers like ""He's Inside Me""). Certainly not those who remember Tammy and her predatory husband as a televangelist swindlers, who extorted Christian families out of their savings, living in the lap of luxury while their supporters struggled. Are you telling me this show was tailored for a niche group of devotees who worship Tammy as a cultural icon? Did the production do any market research for whoever they envisioned their target being? Given the haphazard marketing efforts—or lack thereof—it’s reasonable to conclude that this venture falls squarely into the realm of a vanity project. Perhaps not on the scale of 2005's *In My Life*, but an egotistic venture nonetheless.

When the team finalized an opening date, did they grasp the implications of launching a religious-themed musical amidst the tensions of a contentious election? Was this really the moment to celebrate a figure like Tammy, someone whose legacy can be tied to the rise of Christofascism in our society? Sure, you can spout platitudes of love, yadda yadda bing bong etc., but it doesn't change who she was, and what she represented. Not to mention her involvement in the grift™.

How could a show so lauded in London fail so spectacularly here in the states? One should look to the recent influx of British transplants such as *Bad Cinderella*, *Cabaret* and *Sunset Boulevard*—all of which were received mostly positively abroad, but critically mixed-negative here. It is evident tastes are different across the pond. Not to mention evangelism is seen as truly bizarre to the Brits, who haven't been as directly exposed to it, so the topic could be struck as intriguing and exotic.

Of course, we also know some changes and cuts were made to the musical in its move to Broadway, further blurring its clarity, but I digress.

Did the team consider that the piece might read differently in a gigantic 1600-seat house than its intimate 300-seat origins? Did they have any insight of how well this would sell in a theater roughly five times larger? Not to mention making the show itself bigger to accommodate for all the space? 

Would the show have achieved greater longevity with Rannells instead of Borle? That, I'm not so sure of. While his fanbase is assuredly larger than Borle's thanks to his TV and film career, as well as the recent success of *Gutenburg!*, even he probably couldn't overcome the show's shortcomings. He might have postponed a closing notice by a few weeks, but even that is generous. The bad publicity from Rannells' departure certainly didn't help matters. And, unfortunately, Borle was compared to his predecessor every step of the way, especially when Borle's performance was...well, the less said about it, the better. In all fairness, its important to acknowledge that Borle came in at a significant disadvantage, grappling with a role that had been fundamentally altered and weakened since Rannells' tenure.

I could also discuss how the team perplexingly opted to advertise Rannells' name without actually securing a contract...but I'll leave that there. As one *should* assume, a ""handshake"" deal is no deal at all.

I've talked at length about the material in my own review, but I'll briefly touch on the fact that this was a predominantly British creative team telling a quintessentially American story. Did they seek any input from Americans while creating it? From what we've seen unfold, it feels like they kept the creative process insular, inadvertently creating a disconnect with the very audience they aimed to engage. The negative reception that followed shouldn't have thrown them for such a loop.

We could pick apart the plot and and the musical itself, but that's neither here or there. The show didn't necessarily need to achieve artistic excellence. It needed to sell tickets and turn a profit. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Broadway is a business. It exists to make dolla dolla bills yo. Let's be real: Broadway is expensive. New York is expensive *period*. In this landscape, it’s only logical for patrons—especially tourists—to gravitate toward productions built on familiar intellectual properties. They want a guarantee that their hard-earned money, alongside their scarce leisure time, won’t be wasted. So, consider the predicament: you’re asking someone, who has already spent a fortune merely being in the city, to fork over $200 (per person) for a performance they know nothing about. If they’ve seen little to no marketing, how can they possibly justify that leap of faith?

A question I'd like to ask this team: Are you high?

I mean, if you're using their social media response to the bad reviews as a barometer...But that's another conversation in itself.

So, what's the takeaway here?

First of all, rich people do rich people things. If a Broadway vanity show is how they'd like to frivolously toss away their money, I guess that's their prerogative.

But ultimately this should serve as a cautionary tale to producers and creatives alike. Market research is non-negotiable. Half-assing your way through producing a show is unacceptable.

To those seeking to mount a Broadway-bound show, do your research. Do it for your investors, who are giving you the money to put the show up. Do it for your creatives, who may ultimately decide Broadway isn't the best venture for their work. And do it for your prospective cast and crew. In this unpredictable industry, securing employment is a shared goal. But no one needs to kill themselves trying to turn water into wine, only to inevitably go back to square one. No one wants to see lives interrupted. No one wants to see people unemployed.

$25 million dollars thrown directly into the garbage chute, and for what?

I'm not here to kick a horse while it's down, but I hope this show is remembered in the coming years. As a legendary flop, sure, but more than that, as a wake-up call to know your audience.

Oh, and please don't insult your audience, either. Creatively, metaphorically, and in this specific case, literally.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Something needs to change with early war comps,foxholegame,1gwu7k9,2024-11-21 18:56:31,68,0.88,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame/comments/1gwu7k9/something_needs_to_change_with_early_war_comps/,Yowrinnin,Suggestions,"Camping comp mines as the only method of earning comps is without a doubt the most miserable activity I've ever seen in any video game ever. Queuing up behind some other loser for your turn at doing the most miserable thing ever is ACTUALLY the most miserable thing ever.

Then the frontline meta is designed around ACs and FMGs and if you want to be competitive you have no choice but to multibox a logi alt (which just compounds the issue for everyone) or suck it up and read a book for a few hours (yuck). 

Suggestion 1: no early game unit should cost comps. Just make FMGs etc a significant bmat/emat cost and balance frontline equipment that way.

OR

Suggestion 2: add an active comp farming method. Could be as simple as making the normal hammer capable of a reduced rate. "

Hi guys,

Not sure what to say here but after immersing myself for a few months in the details (reading everything I can possibly get my hands on about this company), not only would I not short this, I’m at an utter loss for how anyone could look at the downside asymmetry and walk away thinking the risk/reward of a short sale could possibly make sense. I’m struggling for a good analogy but feels like parachuting in front of the millennium falcon right before it punches out of some planet at the speed of light. Just totally insane.

Honestly the parallels between ASTS today and Hawkeye’s short write-up on TSLA at a $3.9bn market cap in 2012 should slap you in the face. It’s a painful outcome to contemplate, but even worse than watching that short get nuked into oblivion the first time around, was round 2 when Hawkeye doubled down in the comment thread of Ycombinator’s legendary VIC exit thesis at $59bn in 2018 (after it had 15x’d in his face). I say that because rather than learn anything from the experience, he proceeded to dig in yet again only to have TSLA rip another 16x between then and today. For his sake I’m sure he covered long ago, but it’s worth noting to those familiar with [the reference](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/TESLA_INC/5886965583&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040591114&usg=AOvVaw2iZo4FFlW2nj3I37y9_bi4), the prophecy as of today has been fulfilled; TSLA’s current market cap is currently floating around the 1 trillion mark.

To be clear, that’s not to throw shade at Hawkeye, who I think is a tremendous investor, but it is to highlight the career destroying terror that should rightfully cross the minds of anyone myopic enough to short this potentially world beating exponential compounder so early in its S curve. Even more so based on balance sheet concerns, trailing financials, and a variety of other traditional value investor metrics that couldn’t be more beside the point as ASTS rapidly approaches exit velocity.

If your concern is about ASTS’s technology, again, you might want to reconsider and dig deeper. Not only is it highly likely that this short isn’t going to play out like you think it will, maybe take a moment to reconsider the cost of being wrong here, as the endgame is probably a PM that looks like a prop from the city of Pompeii.

Before I move on, full disclosure: I’m currently balls to the wall long ASTS, as the latter is intrinsically a far better business than Tesla could ever dream of becoming - and far more disruptive at that. **I mean we’re talking about what will likely be the most capital efficient, fastest scaling, largest subscription business in the history of mankind.** 

So yes, just like Ycombinator I’m drinking the kool aid with both fists. If you’re thinking, come on AAOI, where are the red solo cups? Well, I’ll break them out when I get done with the long thesis I’ll be posting shortly, but until then I won’t be passing out any more Kool-Aid because for the time being I want it all for myself. Specialk may think the bull case is ludicrous but let me regale you for a moment on why I’m happy to take the other side of that trade.  

With that, let’s consider the impact of the commercialization of ASTS’s transformative technology and its utterly massive market opportunity in N. America alone over the next few years. After all, to back into this emerging growth vector’s true potential, note T’s CEO said their internal research showed 30-40% of their subscribers would buy the AST service at $10-$15/month extra.

Granted, how quickly penetration goes is an open question, but one of the few things that seems certain is that T/VZ will push the marketing hard. To get an idea of what this looks like from one of many angles, this [article from PC Mag](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pcmag.com/news/ast-spacemobile-details-how-its-cellular-satellite-service-will-work?taid%3D670d9ef018bdc00001f2216c%26utm_campaign%3DtrueAnthem%253A%2BTrending%2BContent%26utm_medium%3DtrueAnthem%26utm_source%3Dtwitter&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040592767&usg=AOvVaw2xVAgmlN75OfBCfqFt71iF) paints the picture just fine. Furthermore, I think there is a world where they fold AST’s service into their premium plans and just jack up the price, so penetration reaches close to 100%, as it just makes too much sense for all parties, not to mention that’s exactly how cellular plans have evolved through time. We used to have daytime/nighttime minutes, pay for text messages, pay for data by GB, etc., so if anything, I think the penetration bias should be upwards given the carrot of “100% coverage everywhere” is marketing nirvana for leading t-comms. Point being, if this assumption is off, its far more likely to be too low rather than high.

(As a quick aside, I’d be shitting my pants if I was T-Mobile, as the market share bleed will be incredible if/when T/VZ starts pushing this added utility in their marketing campaigns. Perhaps that’s why their exclusive deal with Starlink only lasts for 12 months? lol)  

But circling back to the point, availability to T/VZ customers should start by Jan. 1st, 2026, assuming they can make/launch another 40-45 birds by the end of next year. Keep in mind that 17 are already mostly paid for/built and we’ve finally got a hard launch schedule and plenty of financial strength to reach the N. American endgame of continuous coverage.

I’d be remiss not to point out that, at 25 sats, the rest of the constellation is self-funding from that point forward, so the idea ASTS faces material financial risk or shareholders are likely to face significant dilution at this stage just isn't intellectually serious, yet people go on repeating the canard. Remember as well that this is intended to be a simple back of the envelope thought experiment, one that aims to be approximate, not precise. Regardless, I think it should do the trick as far as driving home my larger point on why being short this is suicidal through my eyes. Oh yeah, to be clear, I’ve also assumed internal polling at T is much the same as it will be at VZ, which I think is reasonable, if not conservative - again, if anything I think adoption will balance out far higher than what the estimates below imply.

Ok, circling back to the majestic scalability of this 800-ton Godzilla, for a quick refresher on the implicit ramp set to take place in N America between VZ and T, let’s start with total subs and go from there. T has 72mm and VZ has 75mm, so that’s 147m subs between both. At 30% penetration that’s 44m ASTS Subs that will get flipped on like a light switch, basically overnight.

If MNO’s adopt the $10-$15/month plan as T’s suggested, that’s an uplift of $120/year divided by 2 to account for the 50/50 split with ASTS. That equals AST ARPU of $60/year. So let’s add it all up and we get 44m \* $60, which is 2.6bn in revenue at 90% gross margins, so about $2.3bn in gross profit from N. America alone. (As a quick aside, if you just felt a slight urge to scream “oh yeah” and bust through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man, so did I.)

Moving on, for opex, all you have to do is take whatever sat number is in the air multiplied by 5-6m depending on your estimate of their useful lives. At 7 years that’s $5m/year per sat - at 5 years, that’s $6m/year. Our diligence suggests 7 years is likely closer to the truth, so at the 40 SATS required for full N. American coverage, it would be 40\*$5m or \~$200m in MCapex. Add in another $120m for SGA, Engineering, R&D, and stock comp, and we’ve got EBIT of \~$2bn against a $7.5bn EV, so an EV/EBIT multiple of \~3.75x for what may be the single best business in the history of not just telecom, but of capitalism itself.

Maybe you think that’s too hyperbolic. Fair enough. That said, a $7.5bn EV is just too low for something that could do $3b of cash flow from T/VZ in the US alone. All they have to do is launch what they plan in 2025 and this becomes self-funding and therefore, self-fulfilling.

And just so I’m perfectly clear, the above exercise zero’s out all optionality related to the ROW and additional adjacent market opportunities including IoT, maritime communications, aviation and agriculture connectivity, connected cars, not to mention government/defense related applications. Personally I think their foothold in the latter is worth far more than the entire current EV, especially now that they’ve been officially designated as a prime contractor for the DoD, but I’m saving my thoughts here for my write-up.

For fun though, check out [this post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/doha104p3/status/1844129744532476043?s%3D46&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040594342&usg=AOvVaw0ee8EcTdtFXH4cUrK1f8bA) on X to wet your beak a bit on just how valuable this is to our nation’s defense. Mind you, this is a phased array on an f35 doing that. Now just imagine all the crazy shit can be done with a fleet of giant phased arrays in space. Either way, it barely scratches the surface here, but it does hint at the types of applications made possible and I assure you it will genuinely blow your mind if you decide to walk down this rabbit hole with me. Note that the HALO space program just had its funding upped from $900m to \~$14bn on the heels of ASTS gaining prime contractor status. Hmmm… lol.

Notably, the valuation walk above also ignores the private market value of Starlink, which is estimated at $150bn + despite being absolute trash when it comes to D2D. I’m sure many of you just got triggered, and I’m happy to have this discussion in detail, but come on, just look at all the objective and common-sense evidence underpinning the claim. I mean there is a reason basically every major MNO in the world plus firms like Google and Nokia have agreements with ASTS and not Starlink. Hell, VZ just ran pilots with both companies, and it chose ASTS - makes you wonder why, no? (Hint: It should)

Finally, if you're close enough to the situation to know a thing or two about Starlink's battles with the FCC, I’ll let a very wise friend explain it to you the way he explained it to me, highlighting:

*“Have you read the opposition filings to Starlink? There’s no way Starlink gets approval. Elon is trying his best in the court of public opinion/politics cause it’s his only shot.*

[*https://x.com/jryanthomp/status/1846656515798606297?s=46*](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/jryanthomp/status/1846656515798606297?s%3D46&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040595122&usg=AOvVaw0ff5DkFgs7HS6NBgduezHz)

*The entire Starlink drama is ridiculous.*

*The basic gist is that everyone got together to agree on the space cellular rules.*

*Fast forward a couple years, but after all the comments and back and forth, the FCC issues the SCS (supplemental coverage from space) rules. Final rules have a -120db interference limit.*

*EVERYONE INCLUDING STARLINK AGREED TO THIS LIMIT.*

*Starlink launches it sats and discovers they can’t meet that limit. A limit they previously said they could.*

*Starlink wants a waiver to interfere at -112db - db is a log scale, so this is like almost 10x more interference.*

*Everyone is like WTF, no way*

*I don’t see how Starlink gets the waiver to interfere more. If the FCC somehow grants it, it will be tied up in courts for years anyway cause literally every telco in the world said they will sue”*

As for the other 2.75bn customers of ASTS’s MNO partners around the world, we are still sharpening our pencils on this aspect of the thesis as its all gravy, but for fun let’s assume the same 30% conversion rate for the ROW MNO’s and adjust for how much cheaper cellular plans are everywhere else compared to the US. I’ve been trying to build an idea of the relative avg cost of cell phone plans in Europe and Japan, for example, and have thus far assumed an AST surcharge that scales linearly to the cost of plans in the US (if that makes sense). Stated differently, if VZ and T cellular plans average $100 per month and will now charge $110 - but Vodafone and Rakuten charge $60 per month in Europe and Japan, they would then charge $66 per month. If you're not following, let me know and I’ll take another stab in a follow up.

In any case, we are still finishing the free option side of our diligence, so I’m just pulling these numbers out of my ass, but the point is the presumption I’m anchoring to is I think that we’ll see the same \~10% uplift to plans in major non-US developed markets as we do here in the states. Ergo, if we use the same penetration rate of ASTS MNO’s in the US to their partners 2.8bn subs around the world, that would imply \~800m in subs globally at maturity. I repeat, \~800m subs. 800m!!

Anyway, let’s go ahead and subtract 44m subs for the US so as not to double count, which leaves us with 756m subs less another 200m pulled out of my ass for potential emerging market subs, whose ARPU to ASTS would be lower (likely materially so). In this scenario then, ASTS is left with another 556m subs that would theoretically earn $3 in revenue per sub per month, or $36 per year in ROW ASTS ARPU. That equals an incremental … what … $16bn in recurring subscription revenue at 90% gross margins?

I mean if you’re not fully erect from this thought experiment perhaps you should find another line of work. Reminds me of the awe I felt when I watched Facebook go from zero EBIT in I wanna say 2012 to something like $18bn three years later. This is like that except I’d argue ASTS comes with a more durable moat and a better business model, but I’m not here to measure dicks amongst the great contemporary wealth creation stories, as much as to wake people up with respect to exactly what we are dealing with.

All of which is to say I don’t think it’s crazy to imagine ASTS going from a standing start to \~800m subs within \~3-4 years’ time once its global constellation is up and commercialized sometime in 2026. If this strikes you as something worth shorting, please seek professional help. How about the fact that it’s the most shorted stock on the NYSE right now and to my absolute delight, short interest grew after last week's report, which is bonkers given I’m not sure the incremental info relayed could have been more bullish in the grand scheme of things. In short, this is the technical and fundamental short sale setup from hell. All the better I guess given the embedded unwind.

To wrap (this is already way too long), yes, satellite ventures have indeed faced significant challenges in achieving financial stability and economic viability historically - and that’s honestly being kind given all the dumpster fires in the space to date. However, may I humbly suggest that AST SpaceMobile’s approach in addition to several recent developments in the industry suggest a potentially different trajectory for this company - one that is just as idiosyncratic as comparing Tesla’s rocket ship trajectory to that of the OEM’s history. Not exactly a heuristic that’s worked out well for TSLAQ and I think ASTS shorts are setting up to get similarly bodied - just worse this time around.

**Technical claims around quality of service**

Switching gears for a second, I can’t help but ask: What industry experts have all of you been talking to?

Based on these comments and your innuendo about Abel at the end, I’m guessing your experts are really just another way of saying you’ve talked to Tim Farrar and read the Tegus transcripts. Outside of that I’ve got nothing as there would be no other way to explain your view of the physics and howler takes on the relative service quality.

As far as Tim, all I can say is caveat emptor! It's worth pointing out that this guy has been wrong about everything he’s ever said about ASTS to a degree so embarrassing I don’t even know where to start. In fact, once I was done analyzing his asinine claims we doubled our position on the spot. For context, there is nothing I love to see more in a highly controversial and technical name than some know nothing talking head playing pretend; one that just so happens to have enough knowledge to sound smart to the average generalist.

For example, we more than 10x’ed our money on Afterpay thanks to a guy named Lyall3000 (or something like that) on X. Guy was the smartest pompous moron I’d ever known up until that point, and most of fintwit gobbled it all up despite his uncanny ability to be wrong about literally every foundational point. Similar deal with randoguy on X wrt our longstanding position in Calumet. I could go on, but all I’m saying is you’ve got to be careful who you trust on this stuff as literally every major premise of this specific short case was obliterated by the actual experts we’ve had discussions with in the last two months. I’m also lucky in that I have some very smart friends and the instincts and education of my Director of Research to lean on, who was an award-winning aerospace engineer in a former life.

I mention it because I am sincerely curious to know who these experts are if you don’t mind sharing, if only for my own sake.

As far as the relative value prop and competitive positions of ASTS’s so-called peers are concerned, this updated comparison of Direct-to-Device providers from Anpanman on X is outstanding (@spacanpanman). I think it says it all. And give this shockingly good [deck](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040598277&usg=AOvVaw32S2IuNR4oZfxnw37qHP30) available from The Kook Report a review too, while you're at it. It’s 200 pages but is worth the deep dive, as is taking the time to listen to his first spaces he did earlier today, which can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/thekookreport/status/1858626260769100251&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040598617&usg=AOvVaw2kO-otqMjKH8_wuxMQesxa). Or Anpanman’s [spaces](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/spacanpanman/status/1857957042524135432&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040598854&usg=AOvVaw2KaxlOPXtvO0VTuqwrhMy9) done last week. In fact, all of the above are outstanding primers for where the company sits today.

In our discussions with various people on this topic, both Kook and Anpanman are worth reaching out to for the curious. As the latter sarcastically quipped on the Starlink question, “to date they’ve done 17mpbs peak to one phone - a data point that, by the way, is total capacity for one beam”. Or how about these incredible posts by Tut Capital and the anon individual behind the Tim Farrar parody account. Regardless, Starlink may be a formidable competitor in fixed broadband, but (a) who cares and (b) the idea that it's some category killer in D2D is utterly preposterous.

**CEO Slander**

Finally, with respect SpecialK (re your comments on Abel and his past), come on man. Let’s do better. ENT went to BK because it was a dumb business, not because of EMC. ENT paid for most of the EMC deal in stock as they were trying to get a real business for stock they knew was inflated.

Additionally, Abel's actual exit was not to ENT, as referenced by Farrar (lol), but instead to the buy-out shop, ABRY Partners in 2012. This is where Abel made his money, but the deal terms do not appear public as far as I can tell. Abel did remain as CEO for a time, but it's telling that EMC didn’t make any of the crazy claims Tim has made to date.

The guy is just an absolute moron. That, or he’s paid to say these things or has some difficult to ascertain axe to grind. In the end, who knows - just pointing out that Farrar's insinuation that Abel committed fraud and received ill-gotten gains is as slimy as it is cringe given the evidence. Which is why I find it all so bizarre that he would act intentionally to undermine Abel's credibility in these ways, but you know what they say about not assigning malice to someone's motives when stupidity will do just fine.

All that said, should any of you want to research this claim independently to understand its validity I’d suggest diving into this X thread where Kook systematically takes these claims apart rather humorously.

[https://x.com/thekookreport/status/1435640787564253184](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/thekookreport/status/1435640787564253184&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040600909&usg=AOvVaw0f_HZqqJSag8ipbRHuBDYS)

Better yet, if you want to know who Abel is, whether he’s the right type of crazy and so forth, here’s a good place to start. The bottom line is the guy is an absolute stud. Besides owning like 1/3^(rd) of the equity, he’s never sold a share. In fact, the last time I checked no insider since the company has gone public has sold even a single share to date. Think about that for a minute.

[https://x.com/g2\_5g/status/1839416286709010600](https://x.com/g2_5g/status/1839416286709010600)

Another great read for those looking to get up to speed on ASTS is this masterpiece on the shit show that was Iridium by John Bloom called Eccentric Orbits:

[https://www.amazon.com/Eccentric-Orbits-Iridium-John-Bloom/dp/0802126782](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Eccentric-Orbits-Iridium-John-Bloom/dp/0802126782&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1732039040601787&usg=AOvVaw04wJ0Jj2yPZwKBRoxkOEJ1)

I found it a true tour de force and better yet, you’ll learn all the reasons Iridium failed and how AST has been doing it all differently from the start, using those exact lessons to navigate and chart its own course. From this revelation alone you’ll be able to see reality much more clearly, that much I can say for sure.

**#Sp🅰️cemob**

In closing, I’ve found #Sp🅰️cemob on X to be profoundly helpful getting up to speed over the last two months. I mention it only because if you think the best and brightest in this group are just a bunch of degen retail gamblers yolo’ing for clout, lord help you. Qualitatively speaking, the differences between Roaring Kitty and absurdities like Gamestop and ASTS literally could not be starker. Full stop. I only mention it as I came into this diligence with much the same prejudice and was utterly humbled by what I’ve found. Which reminds me, just as I was putting the finishing touches on this this response, I noticed a new name on the shareholder register as of the 3^(rd) quarter.

Turns out with ASTS, you too can be a stock market genius. -  **Sp🅰️cemob Unite!!** ✊🏼

General planning advice for next 50 years,fatFIRE,1gsbe81,2024-11-15 19:43:25,28,0.8,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/1gsbe81/general_planning_advice_for_next_50_years/,Aggravating_Ad8435,,"Hi all - I've been a fan of this forum for a while. Would love general feedback/advice on how best to structure my nest egg, invest intelligently, and ensure decent returns for my lifetime + my children.

Personal info: late 30s, live in California, married with 2 kids (both under 5). I recently left a job and am contemplating what to do next. Don't really want to work FT if it's not financially necessary. I'm considering some consulting or advisory work, but more out of a desire to stay somewhat occupied than because I need to financially. My wife has a stable government job that pays $150k + pension (rising 3-4% a year).

General breakdown of assets (\~$14M total, $7M liquid):

* $6M taxable equities (mainly in tech stocks, VGT, a few indices)
* $1M Roth IRA (mostly indices)
* $3M in private funds (PE/VC, marked as of Q3'24. Mostly late stage but still illiquid, & may go up or down more. I'm expecting a good chunk to be distributed next year assuming IPOs start coming back, but who knows)
* $2M commercial property (50% share of a \~$4M plot that generates $150k of gross rental income a year)
* $2M primary residence we own
* A couple hundred K in a smattering of 401Ks from past jobs

Expenses (\~$100k once kids are in K-12):

* Housing: $25k property tax, $10k car lease + gas/electric, $20k food (groceries + dining + deliveries), $5k utilities
* Education: $50k daycare for 2, will soon be 0 as they'll be in public school
* Healthcare: $15k premiums, generally low but variable usage
* Discretionary: $15-20k travel, $10k random purchases & kids activities

A few questions:

1. Is it reasonable to target an 8% nominal annual return on the aggregate portfolio, meaning 2x-ing every 9 years? Is that too conservative of a target?
2. Once we start getting liquidity from the private funds, is there somewhere other than equities we should look to put it? I'm a bit disillusioned by PE & VC right now as it's really hard for an outsider to pick good funds, and returns seem to be compressing across the board.
3. Should we sell the commercial property & reinvest elsewhere? We bought it for $2.6M in 2012, estimate it's worth $4M today based on comps. We do get solid income from it, but I wonder about the opportunity cost given the appreciation rate is very low compared to equities. And we don't need the income. Looking back, we could have done a lot better with $2.6M from 2012 in other assets.
4. We have no leverage anywhere today. Are there places we can look to lever somehow & amplify returns + generate tax shielding?
5. Any interesting alternative investments we should look into that have outsized upside potential? Given my wife's income fully covers our HH expenses post-tax, plus we have buffer with the rental income, we have very high tolerance for risk and illiquidity.

We're pretty low key. We don't have fancy hobbies, wear fancy clothes, eat Michelin stars, go to fancy events, or desire trophies. We like to splurge a bit on travel once or twice a year (fly business class, stay at a nice hotel), but otherwise don't spend much outside of core expenses. My goal is to compound this nest egg as well as possible for future generations. We are open to being more aggressive vs. less.

Thanks all!"
"140 breakdown, rose is fine. ",CrucibleGuidebook,1gs7bl6,2024-11-15 16:32:58,102,0.87,162,https://i.redd.it/q9cjhed5w41e1.jpeg,Just-Goated,Discussion,"#Introduction 

Given the talks of rose being op and the charts bungie loves to use, I figured I’d have a look at the base stats of a wide variety of 140’s and see if it really is head and shoulders above every other option. Although this is a very lazy way of showcasing handcannon viability I think it serves as a pretty clear cut explanation of why rose sees such usage. Base weapon stats were simply compared across a variety of 140 hc’s, they were then loosely grouped into various categories worth points and the points then tallied in “stat total”. I also included other categories which I think are relevant. 

#Analysis 

Its stats aren't particularly out of band, just elite amongst all other handcannons, it tops aim assist but various other hc’s have access to sights to boost aa whereas rose doesn’t. Roses top competition however (eyasluna, austringer, exalted truth, palindrome) all got hurt by the rangefinder nerf. Rose has by far the most viable alternate perks in its rf column as it’s a comp weapon built for pvp. Furthermore most of its competitors aren’t enhanceable, rose has been brought forward with power creep whilst its competitors have been left behind. The new stat bump mods have further compounded this issue.

The vast majority of new Handcannons or reintroductions have incredibly poor base stats. This is understandable as rose is from an ‘end game’ activity but fan favourites such as waking vigil, spare rations and judgement haven’t had their stats adjusted nearly enough to compensate for the change to becoming 140 rpm. Judgement is particularly noticeable as a dungeon weapon as Eyasluna is also a dungeon weapon, and has arguably the best base stat package out of all 140’s listed and access to sights to increase aa.

Finally we can talk about slideshot. It’s by the far preferred perk on handcannons and probably always will be in its current state. Bungie is incredibly stingy in giving out slideshot, the fact that better devils has 24 perks and no slideshot is evidence of this. Any weapon with slideshot is viewed as better and preferential to one without, and rose once again simply lacks competition from any decently statted hc with access to slideshot.

The only reasonable exception with decent stats is luna’s howl, unfortunately the model obscures the reticle for m&k users meaning it can feel awful to use. This might sound irrelevant but as most streamers use m&k and influence the general population, this has led to most casuals thinking that luna’s is a gimmick or bad weapon. Feel is important and ultimately most people will prefer the normal 140 recoil + lw boost over luna’s. 

#Conclusion 

So is rose too strong ? We’re currently in an era of unprecedented power creep due to prismatic and perks such as closing time, likely due to bungie trying to keep players engaged. Rose is the only top level handcannon that has been brought forward with enhancing and has a perk pool that survived the rf nerf. As we see power creep in the form of Elsie’s, bygones and various new weapons yet to release, I think it’s important that hc’s still have one true top tier representative. Eyasluna wasn’t broken on release, palindrome and exalted weren’t either. Rose is equal to these guns and we’re currently experiencing powercreep across all aspects of the game.

At a high level there is no real choice at the moment, rose is the last gun standing and therefore everybody uses it. This makes it seem like it’s completely busted and needs to be reigned in, in reality systematic changes have led to there being no real competition. If you look at bungie’s own graph you can see that rose is around the same effectiveness as all other hc’s, the usage is just far higher. 

Unless the stats are made to be worst in class rose will likely remain as the most used handcannon until there is a real competitor or maybe Luna’s gets fixed. 

Justice for waking vigil + spare 🙏
