I finally deleted my Daedalus wallet,cardano,1i9ttwt,2025-01-25 13:45:34,14,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1i9ttwt/i_finally_deleted_my_daedalus_wallet/,Crazy_Leg9966,Wallet,"I've been into Cardano so long that when I first got started, Daedalus was the only wallet we had (or at least the only one I knew about).  But a couple of years ago, I finally made the switch over to light wallets and I've been using Lace and Eternl ever since.  

I kept Daedalus on my desktop even though I had transferred all my ADA out of it.  But every time I would open Daedalus back up just to keep it relevant, I was reminded of how much of a dinosaur it had become compared to using Lace and Eternl.  I have a business laptop that is more powerful than most people use and it struggles with opening Daedalus.  It can easily take an hour or 2-3 hours to  open Daedalus if it's been unused for a while.  And sometimes, something goes wrong and it fails to open even after waiting for half a day or a full day.  So when I think back upon all the time I've wasted trying to load and sync my Daedalus wallet, I decided to simplify my life and remove a time waster.  So today, after using Daedalus for 7-8 years, I deleted my Daedalus wallet and removed it from my laptop.  I'm shredding my seedphrase and using only my new Trezor hard wallet and Lace and Eternl from now on.  

I'll have fond memories of lumbering dinosaur Daedalus.  I liked it because it was all I knew.  But once you've gone light wallet or hard wallet, you can't go back to Daedalus.  No more wasting time waiting for it to sync when I can almost instantly use something else.  My Cardano wallet use has finally evolved.  "

The Ultimate Guide to Staking: Earn Passive Income with Crypto,DeFiYieldClub,1i9l35j,2025-01-25 06:32:43,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9l35j/the_ultimate_guide_to_staking_earn_passive_income/,Solanafluent,,"# 1. Introduction to Staking

# What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards on your crypto by locking it up to help secure a blockchain network. Instead of just holding your tokens, staking lets you put them to work and earn passive income. It’s like earning interest in a savings account, but for crypto.

# Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)

* **PoW (Proof of Work)**: Used by Bitcoin, miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. This requires a lot of computing power and energy.
* **PoS (Proof of Stake)**: Instead of miners, validators are chosen based on how much crypto they stake. This method is more energy-efficient and allows for faster transactions.

# 2. Benefits of Staking

# Earn Passive Income

By staking, you receive rewards in the form of more crypto. For example, if you stake 100 SOL with a 8% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), you will earn 8 SOL over a year.

# Support Network Security

Stakers help validate transactions and prevent attacks. The more users staking, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.

# Eco-Friendly Alternative to Mining

Unlike PoW mining, staking does not require large amounts of energy, making it a more sustainable way to support blockchain networks.

# 3. Types of Staking

# Direct Staking

* You lock up your assets directly on a blockchain.
* Requires technical knowledge.
* You are responsible for managing your stake.

# Delegated Staking

* You delegate your tokens to a trusted validator who stakes them for you.
* Easier for beginners.
* Validators take a small commission from your rewards.

# Liquid Staking

* You stake your assets but receive a liquid staking token (LST) like vSOL, mSOL, or JitoSOL, which can be used in DeFi.
* Allows you to stay liquid and use your staked funds for lending, farming, or other yield strategies.
* Higher rewards potential but involves smart contract risks.

# 4. How to Get Started with Staking

# Choosing the Right Crypto for Staking

* Popular staking tokens include **SOL (Solana), ETH (Ethereum), ADA (Cardano), and DOT (Polkadot).**
* Consider factors like staking yield, lock-up periods, and project credibility.

# Selecting a Wallet and Platform

* Use secure wallets like **Phantom, Ledger, or Solflare**.
* Choose a staking platform that offers transparency and security, such as **Marinade, Lido, Jito, or The Vault**.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Staking

1. **Choose a Wallet**: Set up a non-custodial wallet (etc Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum).
2. **Select a Staking Provider**: Decide whether to stake directly with the network or through a third-party staking service.
3. **Stake Your Tokens**: Follow the platforms instructions to delegate your tokens.
4. **Track Your Rewards**: Use blockchain explorers or staking dashboards to track earnings.

# 5. Risks and Considerations

**Slashing Risks**

Some blockchains will put penalties if validators act corrupt or fail to validate transactions properly. Choosing a strong validator minimizes this risk.

# Lock-Up Periods

* Some networks require a **cooldown period** before you can unstake your tokens. Avoid CEX ( central exchanges at all costs) Coinbase even take a 35% cut from your rewards. That's insane.
* Liquid staking removes this issue but carries its own risks.

# Market Volatility

* Crypto prices goes up or down, so while you earn staking rewards, your staked assets value may decrease.
* Diversifying assets and strategies can help mitigate losses.

# 6. Advanced Staking Strategies

# Yield Farming with Liquid Staking

* Liquid staking tokens (vSOL, mSOL) can be used in **liquidity pools, lending platforms, or farming strategies** to earn extra rewards on top of staking yields. ( even more crypto)

# Restaking for Extra Rewards

* Some protocols allow **restaking**, where you use your liquid staking rewards to earn even more yield in different DeFi platforms.

# Diversification Strategy

* Split your stake across different validators to reduce risk and increase chances of better APY returns.

# Successful Staking Projects

* **Lido (ETH Staking)**: One of the largest staking platforms with liquid staking.
* **Marinade (SOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking.
* **The Vault (vSOL Staking)**: A popular choice for decentralized Solana staking focusing on community.

# 8. Future of Staking

# Emerging Trends

* **Increased Institutional Adoption**: More funds and enterprises staking crypto for yield.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Liquid staking becoming central to yield strategies.

# Regulatory Considerations

* Some countries are **taxing staking rewards as income**, while others see them as capital gains.
* Decentralized staking may face **future regulatory review,** staying informed is key.

# Final Thoughts

Staking is one of the best ways to earn passive income in crypto while supporting network security. Whether you go for **direct staking, delegated staking, or liquid staking**, each method has its pros and cons. The key is to choose a strategy that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

# What Makes $CHIPS Legendary?

Our dev takes regular visits to zoos to get them involved in crypto donations with **Chips** and to bring awareness to the situation with giraffes in general.

Our dev regularly attends spaces with Charles and has spoken numerous times.

Charles himself has even acknowledged the efforts of the dev and our community.

Charles was sent a plushie of **Chips** and even made a tweet about it.

**Chips** is an actual giraffe that was gifted to Charles Hoskinson by the President of South Africa at the time, Cyril Ramaphosa. **Chips** currently resides on a ranch named Phala Phala.

His name is **Chips** because the giraffe loves potato chips - this has been confirmed by Charles.

But here’s the best part.

At some point in time, **Chips** was even considered to be Cardano’s mascot and you can find some talks of this in the Reddit and forums. So this could very well have been THE Cardano mascot.

We haven’t even seen a picture of **Chips**, even though Charles regularly says on camera that he receives pictures of him. But guess what - he already talked about **Chips** live many times.

Cardano Poised for a Potential Rebound—But Will ADA Price Sustain Above $1.2 This Time?,draqai,1i96e25,2025-01-24 16:23:05,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i96e25/cardano_poised_for_a_potential_reboundbut_will/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Cardano’s $ADA moment is heating up, and it’s serving all the unpredictable drama we live for! The token has been playing it cool, trading in a snug little range lately, but activity is lighting up like a neon sign. With daily active addresses surpassing 50,000 and whales diving in for a sweet snack of over 100M $ADA, it’s giving overachiever vibes.  

Now let’s talk price – cha-ching! $ADA recently flirted with breaking the $1 mark as crypto bulls flex their muscles. But oh honey, this isn’t a simple love story. $ADA’s been struggling to make $1 its new forever. It’s dancing on the edge of a consolidation phase, teasing the potential for a breakout moment soon. Are we ready for this glow-up?

The Chaikin money flow hints at the market feeling a little weak – I mean, we all have those off days, right? But bullish divergence is dropping hints of a confidence boost, while the RSI shows the bulls are just waiting for the right moment to slide into the scene. A daily close above $1.020 could truly work the magic and pave a path toward an exciting $1.20 breakout. Who else is here for the stars-in-their-eyes $ADA love affair with fresh highs?

Keep your close watch on those price candles, crypto crew – Cardano might just be gearing up for a whole main character moment. Will this altcoin phenomenon hold? Only time (and those bullish vibes) will tell.

Trump's Executive Orders on Cryptocurrency: What's Next for Prices and Altcoins?,u_TheCryptoCrackerZach,1i8fdht,2025-01-23 17:02:26,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheCryptoCrackerZach/comments/1i8fdht/trumps_executive_orders_on_cryptocurrency_whats/,TheCryptoCrackerZach,,"[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/1iNNRdMf43Q?si=VfcgzLzhfo34tq7A)

Description:  
In this groundbreaking video, we dive deep into the recent executive orders signed by President Donald Trump, which are set to revolutionize the cryptocurrency landscape in the United States. Here's what you need to know:

* Executive Orders Overview: We outline the key executive orders signed by Trump, focusing on those that directly impact the crypto industry. These include the establishment of a cryptocurrency working group, the exploration of a national digital asset reserve, and directives to protect banking services for crypto companies.
* Impact on Bitcoin and Major Altcoins: Discover how these orders could potentially affect Bitcoin's price, possibly leading to new highs as institutional interest grows. We also analyze the implications for major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), which might see increased adoption and price appreciation due to a more favorable regulatory environment.
* Altcoin Surge: With the executive order hinting at a strategic reserve for not just Bitcoin but other digital assets as well, we discuss how this could be a massive win for altcoins, potentially catalyzing a significant rally across the board.
* Regulatory Changes: We break down how the shift in regulatory approach could end the era of de-banking, allowing banks to hold and trade cryptocurrencies more freely. This could lead to broader institutional adoption and a more robust market for digital assets.
* Market Sentiment: Using insights from posts on X, we gauge the current market sentiment which seems largely bullish, anticipating these changes to act as catalysts for the next bull run in the crypto market.
* Future Predictions: Experts and analysts provide their outlook on how these executive orders might reshape the market dynamics, potentially leading to significant price swings and moonshots for certain cryptocurrencies.
* What It Means for Investors: Practical advice for both new and seasoned investors on how to navigate the potentially volatile market conditions following these policy shifts.

ADA Price Prediction Today,draqai,1i8efzt,2025-01-23 16:23:05,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i8efzt/ada_price_prediction_today/,MammothBattle33,,"🤑 Cardano ($ADA) Price Moves Everyone’s Eyes 👀  

If you’re keeping tabs on $ADA, you may want to lean in closer, honey. In the twisted world of crypto, the drama never stops, and it looks like our dear $ADA is stuck in a sultry little consolidation dance between $0.954 and $1.03. Will it break out of that tight little range and sizzle past $1.04 to reach $1.15? Experts think so, but only if it stays above that must-watch $0.95 level. 

The RSI is currently flirting at 47, teasing traders with a potential reversal. But that’s not the only steamy news! Over $146 million worth of $ADA has left exchanges in just the past week. Imagine all of that $ADA being snatched up—it’s giving major “buying pressure incoming” vibes. And if you’re into momentum plays, honey, pay attention. Despite a 0.80% dip in the last 24 hours, $ADA’s volume is hinting at increased participation. Sounds like a slow burn to something way hotter.  

If this keeps up, we could be looking at a solid buying opportunity for those wanting to slide into the Cardano action. Stay locked in, because the next breakout might give you *chef’s kiss* gains. 🔥

What do you think is the best option to trade ADA into a stablecoin?

The Cardano based stablecoins are kind of new and unproven. Are we better off using USDC or USPT on their established chains?

currently I am in discussion with someone from the Cardano-community who told me that I have to delegate my voting-power to a DRep in order to be able to withdraw my staking-rewards. Since I have my ADA on a ledger, I cannot really do this directly but I have to use the cardano - gov - web  -app  - page and there to type in my seed-phrase.

I cannot believe that this is the only way. I will not type in my seed-phrase there since it would be my seed-phrase for my ledger which secures also other assets.

I don't really want to move my ADA anywhere else. What can I do instead or can I withdraw my staking-rewards anyway? I couldn't really find and clarifying ressources out there.

Thank you for clarification!"

"Cryptocurrency Market Update – January 23, 2025",TradingElite,1i7yl37,2025-01-23 03:05:05,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1i7yl37/cryptocurrency_market_update_january_23_2025/,Maylights,,"As of January 23, 2025, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing notable developments across various sectors:

**Market Movements**

* Bitcoin (BTC): Currently trading at $102,378, Bitcoin has seen a slight decrease of 2.6% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $105,579, with a low of $102,378.
* Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is priced at $3,218.67, marking a 2.16% decline. The day's high was $3,329.11, and the low was $3,216.28.
* BNB (BNB): BNB stands at $689.94, down 1.04%, with an intraday high of $701.18 and a low of $688.81.
* XRP (XRP): Trading at $3.14, XRP has decreased by 0.95%, reaching a high of $3.27 and a low of $3.14.
* Cardano (ADA): ADA is at $0.964819, down 2.57%, with a high of $1.016 and a low of $0.964819.

**Bitcoin's Potential Surge**

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., suggested that Bitcoin's price could soar to $700,000 if more funds allocate between 2% to 5% of their investments into the cryptocurrency. Despite previously expressing skepticism about digital assets, Fink now views Bitcoin as a stable instrument against currency debasement and political or economic instability. BlackRock has launched two exchange-traded funds, iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust, investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Regulatory Developments**

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the formation of a ""crypto task force"" aimed at developing regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-crypto stance, this initiative has given investors renewed hope for a more favorable regulatory environment. This move signals the administration's potential focus on reducing crypto regulations. 

**Trump's Cryptocurrency Launch**

Former U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched their own cryptocurrencies, $TRUMP and $MELANIA. These meme-inspired tokens, created on the Solana blockchain, have sparked significant interest within the crypto community. However, critics have raised concerns about their lack of inherent value and the potential for market manipulation, given the high concentration of coins held by Trump's affiliates. 

**Industry Perspectives**

The launch of the Trump tokens has prompted discussions about the ethical and geopolitical implications of such cryptocurrencies. Some experts argue that unregulated cryptocurrencies primarily benefit the billionaire class by circumventing oversight, potentially exacerbating wealth inequality. The industry's struggle with scams and bad-faith actors complicates the situation as insiders and regulators consider the ramifications of Trump's direct involvement in cryptocurrency.

These developments underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, influenced by market movements, regulatory changes, and high-profile endorsements. Investors are advised to stay informed and exercise caution in response to these evolving conditions."

After years of gradually expanding and pruning on other media, I'm starting fresh here.  Would appreciate advice or even personal plugs.  Personal BG below if it helps.

/////////////////////////////////

I'm a hold forever Cardano guy b/c utxo and governance.  Not an Austrian economics guy.  Not a libertarian.  More excited about removing uncertainty, error, and fraud and enabling new modes of collaboration.  Been following the legal stuff around crypto, but haven't been active in the Cardano community a long time. Looking to get back into it now that maybe it's going to get gov't funding/support.  Been sitting on my Ada for several years and expect to do it for many more.  Looking to get on more active alternative media platforms for reasons I do not want to discuss, and which I imagine no on here wants to discuss either."

This Is Why I Invest/Hold Trump and Melania,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i7gj6u,2025-01-22 12:26:43,26,0.97,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i7gj6u/this_is_why_i_investhold_trump_and_melania/,Chandler005,General,"I See a Lot of New People in Crypto on This Sub – Here’s My Two Cents and Why I Bought These Two Coins

First off, welcome to the world of crypto! Here’s my advice for those who are new, and my reasoning behind choosing to invest in these two coins.

# Some Basic Ground Rules:

***1. Never invest money you can’t afford to lose.***

***2. This is NOT financial advice.***   

# Why Meme Coins?

These two coins I’m discussing are meme coins. Typically, meme coins don’t have inherent value—what they do have is hype and a strong community.

If you’re looking for secure investments, these are not for you. Instead, consider traditional stocks, ETFs, or cryptos with solid fundamentals like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano (ADA), or VeChain (VET)... These options may offer lower risk and better stability, but they also come with lower potential returns (e.g., no 2-5x gains).

If you’re chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, then you’re in the right place.

My Background:  I started investing in crypto in 2020 during the last bull run. Back then, I avoided meme coins like the plague because everyone warned me against them.

And while it’s true that they’re incredibly risky, the biggest winners (and losers) often come from meme coins.

I had the chance to invest in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu before they skyrocketed, but I didn’t because I listened to the warnings. Now, looking back, I regret missing out on those massive gains.

So this time around, I’ve decided to allocate 10-15% of my crypto portfolio to meme coins—using money I can afford to lose.

# Why Trump and Melania Coins?

Here’s why I chose these two coins over others:

***There’s a recognizable figure behind them.***

Most meme coins have nothing backing them—no purpose, no leadership. But these coins are tied to two high-profile individuals: the President of the United States and the First Lady.

***Accountability.***

If this were a rug pull, the people behind the coins (Trump and Melania) would face enormous backlash—not just from investors but from the media and the public worldwide.

They can’t afford that level of damage to their reputations, especially from their own supporters.

***Unique opportunity.***

These coins are still very new, which means we’re super early. Yes, there will be volatility in the coming days and weeks, but that’s also where opportunities for profit lie.

 

**The Potential:**

Let’s imagine these coins reach the current market caps of some of the biggest meme coins:

Trump Coin at Dogecoin’s current market cap.

[https://marketcapof.com/en/official-trump/dogecoin/](https://marketcapof.com/en/official-trump/dogecoin/)

Melania Coin at Shib current market cap.

[https://marketcapof.com/en/melania-meme/shiba-inu/](https://marketcapof.com/en/melania-meme/shiba-inu/)

The potential returns here could be huge. Of course, this is a gamble, and I could be completely wrong. But I’m willing to take the risk.

**Final Thoughts:**

If you’re considering investing in these coins, remember to:

***Do your own research.***

***Be prepared for fluctuations.***

**Take profits, especially after 2-5x gains.**

Good luck, everyone!"

Cardano is a decentralized blockchain platform that empowers its community to help shape its future through active participation. At the heart of our governance model are DReps. Any ada holder can register as a DRep or delegate their stake to DReps who align with their values.

Cardano Founder Reveals Why He Skipped The WEF In Davos,Blockviews,1i6yszf,2025-01-21 20:06:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i6yszf/cardano_founder_reveals_why_he_skipped_the_wef_in/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Charles Hoskinson Ditches Davos for a Concrete Playground  

In a move that surprised many, Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind $ADA's Cardano blockchain, opted out of the swanky World Economic Forum in Davos to attend the World of Concrete expo in Las Vegas. Why mingle with the elites when you can roll up your sleeves and learn about cutting-edge concrete tech? For Hoskinson, it's about staying grounded—literally.  

He shared how his interests go far beyond the crypto world. From ranching bison to running a regenerative medicine company, and even managing a contracting business, this guy wears a lot of hats. While his Cardano team held the fort in Davos, he chose concrete innovation, showing his hands-on approach to tech and progress.  

Hoskinson explained that Cardano has grown into a decentralized behemoth, allowing its community to choose its own path. He took the time to highlight some major updates coming to $ADA, including the Plomin hard fork and a whole new governance layer called DReps. These upgrades aim to make Cardano more inclusive, scalable, and forward-thinking than ever.  

And while hobnobbing at black-tie events isn't his thing, Hoskinson made it clear that the world of crypto needs both tech nerds and diplomats. Balancing tech innovation with global collaboration is what keeps the ecosystem thriving.  

With strong plans for stablecoins, oracles, and Hydra scalability solutions in the pipeline, Cardano seems to be on the verge of another breakout year. Hoskinson teased multiple upcoming milestones, including a permanent constitution debate that could shape the future of the ecosystem.  

As $ADA hovers near the $0.98 mark, Cardano fans are gearing up for the next wave of transformations. Hoskinson's unconventional choices remind us that innovation isn't just about big speeches; it’s about staying curious and grounded in the real world.

Can someone help me understand the second value in this transaction?,cardano,1i6yg38,2025-01-21 19:49:24,12,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1i6yg38/can_someone_help_me_understand_the_second_value/,the-noom,General Discussion,"Hi all. I just was reading this article explaining why my ledger has two receiving addresses for cardano deposits: https://support.ledger.com/article/360033802154-zd


In one of my deposits, I sent my ledger wallet 988 ADA. One of the addresses received 988, but the other received 70K.
I thought change was money being returned to me - but I’ve never come close to owning 70K ADA. 
When I click on the address on Cardanoscan, it says the balance of the account is 42k ADA, which I also have never come close to owning.

Is this some sort of shared pool?
Appreciate your insight."

Stake Distribution Before Plomin Hard Fork,cardano,1i6jlc7,2025-01-21 09:19:44,18,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1i6jlc7/stake_distribution_before_plomin_hard_fork/,Cardanians,Governance,"ADA holders were given several months to either delegate their voting power to DReps or register as DReps themselves. Most of them did neither. However, this does not prevent Cardano from entering the Voltaire era. Let's examine the distribution of ADA coins just before the Plomin Hard Fork. For historical reasons, it is good to record the state in which Cardano will enter on-chain governance.

In all this madness and meme climate, we are the only peer reviewed, scientifically based, professionally built blockchain. The fundamentals will hold strong and shine in the end. That’s why Cardano isn’t going anywhere. It’s built properly from the ground up every step of the way. We have never been down, we’ve never been hacked. We have incredibly low fees. It’s incredibly easy to use and we can do 1 million TPS.

I recently started using the Cardano blockchain and I store my ADAs on the Eternl wallet. I have read about the reserve funds for Collateral UTxO but what I don't understand is why the amount of the reserve varies between accounts in the same wallet. For example, I have accounts where the reserve amount is set at 5 ADA, others at 20 ADA and one at 11.2 ADA. 
What explains these variations ?

Thank you in advance for your answers."

Cardano (ADA): Known for its slow and steady approach to blockchain development.
Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme coin driven by Elon’s backing and retail hype.
LCX: Regulated exchange with a focus on tokenized assets and compliance.
Stellar (XLM): XRP-like, but focused on retail cross-border payments.
Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme coin trying to add utility with its ecosystem like Shibarium.
What do you think about their long-term potential or performance this cycle?"

# SCAMS

Be aware of scams and scammers, always follow the rule, ""**Don't trust, verify**"". Always publicly verify whether a source of information/offer is true and don't let greed violate that rule. Be cautious before connecting your wallet to any site, entering your seed phrase or sending ADA to an unknown wallet. 

Scammers often approach people in private messages and imitate legitimate people and entities.

Sometimes the will send out scam tokens to try and phish you into visiting scam websites.

Do not be fooled, almost anything can be faked like websites, apps, the number of subscribers, viewer count, video (ai can generate fake videos), verification status.  

Cardano doesn't do ADA giveaways. Make sure you verify any airdrops from other projects.

No your wallet does not need to be verified!

What're its greatest weaknesses? Looking to get in, but from what I'm seeing (i.e. redditors saying ADA is against what Trump wants/does, uncertainty about whether it's US-based, etc...), I am unsure pertaining to the sentiment around the coin right now and whether I should wait a bit longer, or switch around some of my holdings to include this asset. I am also fully aware of the ""should I wait vs buy now"" rhetoric and am mainly stating that to understand whether we feel this coin will have a surprising increase this run, or if it will take more time for the Cardano team to work on, and refine, their project."
