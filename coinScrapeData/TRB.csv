Trend Following Analysis of Tellor Network's TRB Token  
  
Abstract  
  
This study conducts a comprehensive trend following analysis on Tellor Network's TRB token, focusing on its unique market dynamics within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Tellor Network, known for its decentralized oracle services, has shown distinctive price movements influenced by its utility in DeFi applications and broader market sentiment towards decentralized data solutions. The analysis employs various trend following strategies, including moving averages and momentum indicators, to evaluate TRB's performance from historical data up to recent market activities observed in 2024. Key findings include significant volatility spikes correlating with DeFi sector trends and specific on-chain events, such as the development announcements of Tellor Layer, which promise enhanced data transmission capabilities. The study also explores the impact of market manipulation allegations on TRB's price stability, suggesting a cautious approach to trend following in highly speculative environments. Overall, the analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of trend following strategies for TRB, highlighting both opportunities and risks inherent in trading this token, which could inform future investment strategies in similar decentralized finance assets.

The token printed a bullish MACD Crossover on the daily chart just today. In addition, Tellor broke through its local resistance at $75 and confirmed it on the daily chart, too.

Moreover, the bullish MACD crossover shows solid results in backtests. Based on 28 appearances, the signal led to [gains](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/GNS_USDT?contentId=10864523837738) of 10% and more, up to 71%.

From a trade setup point-of-view, a first take profit goal can be set at $89, leading to gains of \~14%. As 2nd take profit, the EMA200 seems logical, sitting at $92.50, resulting in 20% gains.

A stop loss can be added slightly below the previous resistance at $75 (e.g., 74.5), resulting in a risk/reward ratio above 5!

Tellor Trade Successfully Closed ‚Äî Signal Indicates More Downside Potential üìâ,cryptoos,1dudu17,2024-07-03 09:03:01,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoos/comments/1dudu17/tellor_trade_successfully_closed_signal_indicates/,RealTradingguy,,"Just yesterday, I posted a trade setup to short $TRB on the 4H chart. With today's market dip we reached the profit target easily.

However, the dip flashed another bearish signal for Tellor, indicating even more downside potential. Here are the details üëá

1Ô∏è‚É£ Trade Signal  
Tellor flashed a bearish Parabolic Trader signal on the 4H chart. The signal combines indicators such as the EMA200, PSAR, ADX, and MACD.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reliability  
Based on backtests, the signal shows solid reliability on the 4H chart. In terms of TRB and based on 13 signals, it has a 77% probability of achieving 5% gains.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Profit Potential  
The profit target is calculated at 8% and aligns with the TRB's resistance at $82. However, based on the backtest data, it might be reasonable to use two profit targets.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What about the chart?  
Tellor's 4H chart looks mostly bearish and, therefore, supports the signal. The token fell below the reversal trendline, which has served as a support area for several days.

   Po zarejestrowaniu siƒô na gie≈Çdzie bƒôdziesz musia≈Ç zdeponowaƒá z≈Çot√≥wki na swoje konto. Wybierz odpowiedniƒÖ opcjƒô depozytu, kt√≥ra umo≈ºliwi Ci przelanie ≈õrodk√≥w na konto gie≈Çdowe.

### 3. Znajd≈∫ parƒô handlowƒÖ TRB/PLN:

Dlaczego Tellor tak rosnie?,kryptomaniak,1bum5mw,2024-04-03 03:00:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kryptomaniak/comments/1bum5mw/dlaczego_tellor_tak_rosnie/,Ujowo,,"Tellor (TRB) jest jednym z ciekawszych projekt√≥w w ekosystemie kryptowalut, a jego dynamiczny wzrost mo≈ºe byƒá wynikiem kilku czynnik√≥w. Po pierwsze, warto zauwa≈ºyƒá, ≈ºe Tellor jest protoko≈Çem umo≈ºliwiajƒÖcym zbieranie danych z zewnƒôtrznych ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç i dostarczanie ich do inteligentnych kontrakt√≥w w sieci Ethereum. Ta funkcjonalno≈õƒá jest kluczowa dla rozwoju DeFi (Decentralized Finance) i innych aplikacji opartych na blockchainie, co przyciƒÖga uwagƒô inwestor√≥w zainteresowanych tym sektorem.

Kolejnym czynnikiem mogƒÖcym wp≈ÇynƒÖƒá na wzrost Tellora jest ograniczona poda≈º token√≥w. Zgodnie z modelem ekonomicznym projektu, nagrody dla g√≥rnik√≥w sƒÖ ograniczone, co mo≈ºe prowadziƒá do deflacjiowej presji na cenƒô TRB. W po≈ÇƒÖczeniu z rosnƒÖcym zainteresowaniem ze strony spo≈Çeczno≈õci kryptowalutowej, ograniczona poda≈º mo≈ºe generowaƒá popyt na token.

Dodatkowo, rozw√≥j ekosystemu Tellora i partnerstwa z innymi projektami mogƒÖ dodatkowo napƒôdzaƒá wzrost. Im wiƒôksza u≈ºyteczno≈õƒá protoko≈Çu Tellora, tym wiƒôksza warto≈õƒá jego tokena. Partnerstwa z innymi projektami DeFi lub zastosowania w innych obszarach mogƒÖ wiƒôc przyczyniƒá siƒô do zwiƒôkszenia popytu na TRB.

Warto r√≥wnie≈º zauwa≈ºyƒá, ≈ºe rynek kryptowalut jest zwykle podatny na spekulacje i trendy. Wzrost Tellora mo≈ºe wiƒôc byƒá czƒô≈õciowo wynikiem wzrostu og√≥lnego zainteresowania kryptowalutami lub spekulacyjnej aktywno≈õci inwestor√≥w.

PodsumowujƒÖc, wzrost Tellora mo≈ºe byƒá wynikiem kilku czynnik√≥w, takich jak rozw√≥j ekosystemu DeFi, ograniczona poda≈º token√≥w, partnerstwa z innymi projektami oraz og√≥lna spekulacyjna aktywno≈õƒá na rynku kryptowalut.

The curious case of Tellor pump and dump: The team dumped 4.2 million worth $TRB just before the fall from $555 to 121,ethtrader,18vy6cb,2024-01-01 09:48:27,19,0.71,82,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18vy6cb,pythonskynet,Technicals,"The team Tellor had dumped 4,211 $TRB tokens (worth approximately $4.2 Million) and price dumps from $555 to $120 within few minutes.

It was pumped a lot and maybe that forced the team to cash out some fund. Was price dump a coincidence or manipulation? 

#Rise of TRB 

As far as I know, Tellor is an Oracle project similar to Chainlink. It has tokens on Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Gnosis networks.

On 25th August 2023, $TRB was trading below $10 - fast forward to December 31st, it was trading at $555 for a brief moment before falling to $120. 

On Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, TRB has largest 24H volume of more than 10 Billion, overtaking BTC and ETH by huge margin. 

It was at $293 and there was a sudden dump to $210. And within 3 hours, price was back to $300 and the pump continued to $555 before plummeting to $120. Right now trading at $215+.

#Huge Liquidations from the pump dump 

The dip caused people to liquidate more than $70 million at that time, more than any other cryptocurrency. (*This has my contribution as well..*)

What's your take on this incident just around the New Year celebration time? Drunk trades by whales?"

Is Oracle season close?,defi,17epz0n,2023-10-23 13:28:17,10,0.86,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/17epz0n/is_oracle_season_close/,stormingaround10,:discuss: Discussion,"Regardless of the fact that this bear market has been going on for a long time, it has opened the door to many opportunities and time for research. That is a good thing for long-term investors. Developers also got a new opportunity to improve things in order to attract new investors with innovations. 

Talking about the development, Oracle projects have been standing strong and keep delivering top-quality products. These decentralized data bridges serve as the crucial link between the real world and smart contracts. But what's truly fascinating is how their development connects with the broader crypto landscape. There were such notable integrations with L2 networks Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Manta Pacific. Developers have wide access to reliable data that allows them to build. 

Also, we witnessed occasionally pumps around oracles, LINK, BAND, and TRB, lately. That might be due to Chainlink's presence on [SmartCon](https://x.com/chainlink/status/1716166781830906279?s=20) or staking upgrade, Band integrations with Sora Network, Harmony, and  Flow, Tellor integration with [Manta Network](https://tellor.io/blog/tellor-deploys-to-manta-pacific/), and DIA's [Oracle Builder](https://www.diadata.org/blog/post/dia-product-beta-testing-program/) no-code tool that allows the creation of data feeds in a few minutes. Who knows?

Oracles play a pivotal role in enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world data. From price feeds to weather reports, they ensure the reliability and accuracy of information, which is critical for decentralized applications across various industries. DeFi's rapid rise would be impossible without oracles. They enable lending, yield farming, liquid staking, and other DeFi applications to access external data securely. The improved development of oracles ensures that DeFi remains robust and dependable. Trust in the accuracy and security of data is paramount. Oracle networks must continually innovate to address vulnerabilities and maintain trust.

The development of oracles is, in many ways, a reflection of the crypto world's constant innovation. As DeFi matures, so do the oracles that underpin it. It's a symbiotic relationship, each driving the other forward.

What's Next? As oracles continue to evolve, they'll unlock new possibilities across various sectors, from supply chain management to insurance. The future is exciting, as the crypto world continues to advance alongside these essential bridges between two worlds. 

What are your thoughts on oracles? Are you dubious about its future or do you think that's where the gems should be looked for?"

However, its success is closely tied to the adoption of metaverses and Treasure games.  
Tellor (TRB):  
  
Tellor's role as a decentralized oracle protocol is essential for smart contracts that rely on off-chain data.  
Incentives for accurate data reporting are a positive aspect.

Significant TRB Withdrawal from Binance to 0x0ba Address Influences Price: Odaily Planet Daily News Report,BitcoinzTech,16mhs6z,2023-09-19 00:53:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinzTech/comments/16mhs6z/significant_trb_withdrawal_from_binance_to_0x0ba/,Bitcoinz_Tech,Cryptocurrency,"In a recent development that has caught the attention of the crypto community, 74,577 Tellor (TRB) tokens, equivalent to approximately $2.2 million, were withdrawn from Binance to the address 0x0ba. This noteworthy transaction occurred just 15 minutes ago and has had a discernible impact on the TRB market.

According to insights provided by on-chain analyst Ember Monitoring, this withdrawal follows a series of TRB transfers to Binance from multiple addresses that took place yesterday. The influx of TRB tokens into Binance coincided with a notable price drop for TRB, which plummeted from $36 to $24.

The sudden withdrawal of 74,577 TRB tokens from Binance to the 0x0ba address is significant, not only due to its substantial value but also because it appears to have influenced the TRB market. Following this transaction, the TRB price has experienced a rebound, climbing to $31.

Crypto markets are well-known for their sensitivity to large transactions, and this event underscores how such movements can impact asset prices. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the situation, seeking to understand the motives and potential implications of this withdrawal on the TRB ecosystem.

As the crypto space continues to evolve, data analysis and real-time monitoring play crucial roles in assessing market dynamics and understanding the factors that drive price movements. The Odaily Planet Daily News will continue to follow this developing story and provide updates as further information becomes available, shedding light on the intricacies of the cryptocurrency market."

Data Oracles: The Unsung Heroes of the Blockchain World,AllCryptoBets,14crlc1,2023-06-18 14:36:47,9,1.0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/14crlc1/data_oracles_the_unsung_heroes_of_the_blockchain/,iamjide91,Educational ," 

I stumbled upon [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/13qm9qb/the_era_of_liquid_staking_and_oracle_innovations/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) discussing a particular Data oracle and it piqued my interest, so I decided to do some further research on the topic. Here are my top findings.

1. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. It has partnerships with several leading blockchain projects, including Polkadot, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain.

2. Band Protocol (BAND): Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. It has partnerships with several leading blockchain projects, including Elrond, Avalanche, and ICON.

3. Tellor (TRB): Tellor is a decentralized oracle network that provides high-value data to smart contracts on Ethereum. It has partnerships with several leading blockchain projects, including Chainlink, Compound, and Aave.

4. DIA (DIA): DIA is a decentralized platform that provides transparent and reliable price data for DeFi applications. It leverages crowd-sourcing and machine learning to provide high-quality data feeds for cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, and other digital assets. DIA has partnerships with several leading blockchain projects, including Chainlink, Kyber Network, and MakerDAO.

DIA has seen significant growth in adoption and partnerships in recent months. Its native token, DIA, has also performed well in the market, with a current market cap of about 50 million USD. DIA's focus on transparency, decentralization, and high-quality data has made it a popular choice for DeFi applications and other blockchain projects.

Data oracle projects are often overlooked because they are not as flashy or attention-grabbing as other blockchain projects. While DeFi applications and NFTs tend to get a lot of attention and media coverage, data oracle projects are often seen as more technical and less exciting. Additionally, many people may not fully understand the importance of data oracles in the blockchain ecosystem and how they enable smart contracts to interact with the real world.

However, data oracles are a critical component of many blockchain applications, especially those in the DeFi space. They provide accurate and reliable data feeds that allow smart contracts to make informed decisions and execute complex financial transactions. Without data oracles, many DeFi applications would not be possible.

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow and mature, we can expect to see more attention and investment directed towards data oracle projects. As more people recognize the importance of accurate and reliable data in the blockchain space, data oracles will become increasingly essential to the success of many blockchain applications."
